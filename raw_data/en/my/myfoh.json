An Overview Study [https://doi.org/10.3390/sports5040079](https://doi.org/10.3390/sports5040079) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-sports-05-00079)]. Women with breast cancer experience issues related to an altered body image which may affect self-esteem and self-image, and pose a challenge for their QoL [ [2](#B2-sports-05-00079)]. [3](#B3-sports-05-00079)], complementary therapies in cancer care are used to supplement regular cancer care, such as supportive measures to control symptoms, enhance QoL and well-being, and contribute to overall patient care. Horneber et al. [ [4](#B4-sports-05-00079)] argued that the use of complementary therapies among cancer survivors has increased significantly, from 25% in the 1970-1980s to 49% since 2000, suggesting that today's cancer survivors are increasingly interested in supplementing medical treatment with unconventional therapies, methods and natural products. Researchers claim that health care services should develop strategies to satisfy the patient's knowledge and desire for the use of complementary therapies, and that more research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of such therapies [ [4](#B4-sports-05-00079)]. [5](#B5-sports-05-00079)]. [6](#B6-sports-05-00079)]. An important question of interest to researchers, cancer survivors and clinicians is whether such complementary therapies are effective. Research on complementary therapies is growing rapidly and well-established research centers worldwide (e.g., Cochrane Library, Natural Medicines) provide high-quality pooled evidence of the effect on patient outcomes. In the wake of this, overviews of review literature have emerged. Lee et al. [ [7](#B7-sports-05-00079)] performed an overview study of research on the effectiveness of qigong on any health condition and patient outcome, stating that a conclusion concerning the effect from qigong was not possible due to the poor research quality of qigong trials. McCall et al. [ [8](#B8-sports-05-00079)] conducted an overview to investigate the characteristics and effects of yoga interventions on chronic health conditions, concluding that yoga may reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Kelley and Kelley [ [9](#B9-sports-05-00079)] performed a meta-analysis of systematic reviews to investigate the effects of different complementary therapies in vast patient populations, finding that yoga exercise had a positive effect on QoL. To our knowledge, our study is the first overview of literature focusing on the benefits from mind-body exercise on QoL in breast cancer populations. 2. Materials and Methods [10](#B10-sports-05-00079), [11](#B11-sports-05-00079)]. In the current overview, the framework by Smith et al. [ [12](#B12-sports-05-00079)] guided the identification and selection of eligible review studies, followed by summarization and discussion of conclusions. 2.1. Data Sources and Searches [Table 1](#sports-05-00079-t001). 2.2. Study Selection and Inclusion Criteria [13](#B13-sports-05-00079)] guidelines. To detect relevant studies, titles and abstracts were assessed for relevance and duplication, based on the established inclusion criteria of: (a) literature review, systematic reviews and/or meta-analysis; (b) interventions testing the efficiency of mind-body therapies that included an element of bodily movement (i.e., yoga, tai chi chuan, qigong); (c) patient outcome of QoL; (d) populations of breast cancer survivors during treatment and recovery. Eligible abstracts were retrieved in full-text copies for further examination, to establish relevance to the research question before final inclusion and data extraction [ [12](#B12-sports-05-00079)]. 2.3. Data Extraction and Quality Assessment [14](#B14-sports-05-00079)] for quality assessment of multiple systematic reviews. The following 11 domains were rated: review design, literature search, data extractor involvement, status of publication (i.e., grey literature), list of included and excluded studies, characteristics of included studies, documentation of quality assessment, use of quality assessment in concluding remarks, methods of synthesis of findings, assessment of publication bias, and statement of conflict of interest [ [14](#B14-sports-05-00079)]. Each domain achieved either \"Yes\" (1 point), \"No\" (0 points), or Can't tell (CA)\" (0 points), and each study could achieve a maximum quality score of 11 points. AMSTAR scores 10 were considered 'very high', 8-9.9 scores as 4-7.9 scores as 'low' quality [ [8](#B8-sports-05-00079)]. 3. Results [Figure 1](#sports-05-00079-f001)). 3.1. Characteristics of Mind-Body Therapy Studies [15](#B15-sports-05-00079)] and Stan et al. [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079)] studied effects from interventions after cancer treatment. Lee et al. [ [17](#B17-sports-05-00079)], Pan et al. [ [18](#B18-sports-05-00079)], Pan et al. [ [19](#B19-sports-05-00079)] and Zhang et al. [ [20](#B20-sports-05-00079)] included participants who were undergoing cancer treatment. The five remaining studies researched the effects of interventions both during and after treatment [ [21](#B21-sports-05-00079), [22](#B22-sports-05-00079), [23](#B23-sports-05-00079), [24](#B24-sports-05-00079), [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)]. The populations in the original studies were mainly women with breast cancer, aged 18 to 70 years. Buffart et al. [ [22](#B22-sports-05-00079)] and Shneerson et al. [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079)] also studied the effect of mind-body interventions among other cancer sites, in one of thirteen, and three of thirteen original studies, of these, yoga was tested as a sole mind-body therapy [ [18](#B18-sports-05-00079), [20](#B20-sports-05-00079), [22](#B22-sports-05-00079), [23](#B23-sports-05-00079), [24](#B24-sports-05-00079), [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)]. Tai chi chuan was studied in three of the reviews. Two reviews included solely tai chi chuan exercises [ [17](#B17-sports-05-00079), [19](#B19-sports-05-00079)], while Stan et al. [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079)] included tai chi chuan with yoga, pilates and qigong. Qigong was studied in two reviews. Shneerson et al. [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079)] included one qigong intervention along with four yoga interventions, while Bleakely and Stinson [ [21](#B21-sports-05-00079)] reported from one qigong intervention and four [17](#B17-sports-05-00079), [18](#B18-sports-05-00079), [19](#B19-sports-05-00079), these were meta-analyses aiming at studying effects from complementary therapies on patient outcomes of quality of life (QoL) [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079), [18](#B18-sports-05-00079), [19](#B19-sports-05-00079), [20](#B20-sports-05-00079), [22](#B22-sports-05-00079), [24](#B24-sports-05-00079)], while with other quantitative designs [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079), [17](#B17-sports-05-00079), [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)]. One of the randomized, controlled trials (RCT) in Levine and Balk [ [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)] also comprised qualitative data collection. Between eight and thirty-five original studies were included in the review articles. Effect on global QoL was reported in five of the review articles [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079), [19](#B19-sports-05-00079), [21](#B21-sports-05-00079), [24](#B24-sports-05-00079), [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)], and health related quality of life (HRQoL) was reported in 4 of the included studies [ [17](#B17-sports-05-00079), [18](#B18-sports-05-00079), [22](#B22-sports-05-00079), [23](#B23-sports-05-00079)]. Shneerson et al. [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079)] reported an effect on physical and psychological QoL. Buffart et al. [ [22](#B22-sports-05-00079)] reported effects of complementary therapies on general QoL. Only Levine and Balk [ [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)] reported about disease-specific quality of life. The extracted information is included in a summary table ( [Table 2](#sports-05-00079-t002)). 3.2. Methodological Quality of Included Reviews [Table 3](#sports-05-00079-t003)) revealed an AMSTAR median score of eight across included studies (range: 3-9). Seven of the eleven reviews achieved a high-quality score (AMSTAR score: 8-9.9), considered to satisfy at least [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079), [18](#B18-sports-05-00079), [19](#B19-sports-05-00079), 4-7.9) [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079), [17](#B17-sports-05-00079), methodological quality (AMSTAR score: 0-3.9) [ [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)]. The reviews were published within a time span of seven years (2011-2017). No differences in methodological quality were identified relating to early or later time of publishing. [16](#B16-sports-05-00079), [24](#B24-sports-05-00079)]. A list of included and excluded studies (domain 5) was not provided by any of the reviews, while two studies addressed the domain (10) \"likelihood of publication bias assessed\", stating that risk of publication bias was assessed by use of funnel plots [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079), [23](#B23-sports-05-00079)]. Domains (1) and (3) were met in all studies, while ten of the eleven reviews reported on duplicate study selection and data extraction (domain 2) a list of the characteristics of the included studies (domain 6) forest plots. Significant heterogeneity was reported and discussed in five of the meta-analyses [ [18](#B18-sports-05-00079), [19](#B19-sports-05-00079), [20](#B20-sports-05-00079), [22](#B22-sports-05-00079), [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079)], results from heterogeneity testing was displayed by Forest Plot for one of four QoL outcomes, and reported as not applicable in three of the rest of the outcomes. This finding was not discussed further in the paper. 3.3. Program Features and Adherence [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)], Shneerson et al. [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079)] and Stan et al. [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079)] also reported on Restorative yoga (i.e., passive stretching). All of the included reviews provided information on frequency (times/week) and length (weeks) of the yoga programs. Pooled results from the reviews show that the programs were performed 1-3 times per week, and over a range of 3 weeks to 6 months. All reviews reported the duration (minutes/session) of the yoga sessions/classes, showing a variation of 30-120 min. [16](#B16-sports-05-00079), [17](#B17-sports-05-00079), [19](#B19-sports-05-00079)]. Across reviews, the tai chi chuan programs were performed for 50-60 min, 1-3 times per week over 6-24 weeks. Tai chi chuan styles were reported in two reviews. In Pan et al. [ [19](#B19-sports-05-00079)], the majority of the trials applied the styles of Chi Kung and Yang, while in Stan et al. [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079)], all five included tai chi chuan trials that applied Yang style. [15](#B15-sports-05-00079)] included one original study on medical qigong, practiced for 90 min, 2 times per week for 10 weeks. Stan et al. [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079)] included two qigong intervention studies that used a variety of external, medical and chan-chuang qigong. [22](#B22-sports-05-00079)] found attendance to yoga classes varied from 58 to 88%, with inconsistent results concerning the association between yoga class adherence and quality of life. In the discussion of results, Stan et al. [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079)] reported excellent program evaluation concerning adherence to yoga in the reviewed studies, and claimed yoga interventions were popular among women with breast cancer. In the review by Harder et al. [ [24](#B24-sports-05-00079)], adherence was reported in five of eighteen yoga interventions, showing a heterogeneous picture of class attendance. Here, a neutral or positive effect from yoga on QoL outcomes was associated with adherence to the program. Two of the reviews reported attrition as a risk of bias. In Cramer et al. [ [23](#B23-sports-05-00079)], four of twelve included trials had high drop-out rates, while half the studies in the meta-analyses of Zhang et al. [ [20](#B20-sports-05-00079)] reported a large amount of attrition. None of the reviews that focused specifically on benefits from tai chi chuan [ [17](#B17-sports-05-00079), [19](#B19-sports-05-00079)] reported adherence rates from the included trials. 3.4. Effect of Mind-Body Therapies on Quality of Life [15](#B15-sports-05-00079), [18](#B18-sports-05-00079), [20](#B20-sports-05-00079), [22](#B22-sports-05-00079), Among reviews without meta-analysis, Bleakley and Stinson [ [21](#B21-sports-05-00079)] concluded that in half the studies of mind-body therapies, yoga had an effect on global QoL. Harder et al. [ [24](#B24-sports-05-00079)] established that yoga showed moderate-to-large effects on global and emotional QoL, but had no effect on physical QoL. Levine and Balk [ [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)] identified significant benefits from yoga on breast cancer patients' physical well-being, emotional health, social functioning and functional adaption. Stan et al. [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079)] found positive and statistically significant, or trending toward significance, effects of QoL from yoga. Improvements from yoga seemed to be related to the amount of yoga and the intervention duration. A greater number of yoga classes were found to significantly correlate with improvements in QoL [ [24](#B24-sports-05-00079)], while yoga interventions of more than three months duration had the largest effects on QoL [ [18](#B18-sports-05-00079)]. None of the reviews distinguished between different yoga styles regarding the effect on QoL. [19](#B19-sports-05-00079)]. Lee et al. [ [17](#B17-sports-05-00079)] reported inconclusive results from four tai chi chuan interventions. Positive inter-group differences (p < 0.01) were found for HRQoL and self-esteem in one RCT, and for global QoL (p < 0.01) in one non-randomized controlled study. In Stan et al. [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079)], improvements from tai chi chuan on QoL were studied in two RCTs. One reported positive change in HRQoL domains of physical functioning and mental health, and one found improved global QoL after 12 weeks of performing tai chi chuan. [15](#B15-sports-05-00079)] found uncertain effects from qigong, based on only one study. In Stan et al. [ [16](#B16-sports-05-00079)], QoL outcomes were studied in two of four qigong trials, and qigong was found efficient for improvements of QoL in one RCT. In this RCT only 34% of the participants were breast cancer survivors. 4. Discussion [26](#B26-sports-05-00079)]. The overview suggests that breast cancer survivors are most likely to experience positive change in the psychological components of QoL from practicing yoga, like improved self-esteem and body image, stress reduction, increased sleep quality, less anxiety and depression, and better emotional and social well-being [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079), [16](#B16-sports-05-00079), [18](#B18-sports-05-00079), [20](#B20-sports-05-00079), [23](#B23-sports-05-00079), [24](#B24-sports-05-00079), [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)]. Similar have found by McCall et al. [ [8](#B8-sports-05-00079)] and Pascoe and Bauer [ [27](#B27-sports-05-00079)], stating that yoga may decrease anxiety and depression. Moreover, a pooled result from five meta-analyses on yoga trials among women with breast cancer yielded statistically significant moderate-to-large effects on psychosocial QoL outcomes [ [9](#B9-sports-05-00079)]. Explanations as to why yoga exercises positively influence the psychosocial side of QoL might be found in the nature of yoga and its union of body, mind and spirit. Daley [ [28](#B28-sports-05-00079)] claimed that exercise is a form of behavioral activation, leading to improvement of the patient's self-esteem and mastery experience towards recovery. Such psychological benefits from exercise may be underestimated by patients and health professionals. Exercise professionals working in cancer care and rehabilitation should consider promotion of yoga as strengthening the psychological QoL in breast cancer survivors. [25](#B25-sports-05-00079)] reported significant effects from yoga on physical well-being components of symptom distress and treatment side-effects. Based on their findings, practicing yoga may relieve chemotherapy-induced symptoms of nausea and vomiting, and increase the patient's ability to cope with her physical condition. Yoga styles reported in the included reviews were derived from Hatha yoga, which combine postures, breathing and meditation. Although considered a more physical yoga style, Hatha yoga is a low impact physical exercise [ [29](#B29-sports-05-00079)]. Moreover, ranging from 2 to 4 metabolic equivalents (METS) (1 MET = the amount of oxygen consumed while resting), yoga does not meet recommendations for improving or maintaining cardiovascular fitness [ [30](#B30-sports-05-00079)]. Although yoga has sparse effects on muscle strength, it may improve balance and mobility. This is an important aspect related to common side effects from breast cancer treatment that causes stiffness and postural instability [ [31](#B31-sports-05-00079)]. Yagli et al. [ [32](#B32-sports-05-00079)] suggested yoga as an adjunct to aerobic exercise programs for breast cancer survivors, to obtain both physical and psychosocial wellness. [7](#B7-sports-05-00079)] claim that in addition to inadequately documented effects from mind-body therapies on QoL domains among cancer survivors, the body of research is limited by poor quality RCT designs with heterogeneous outcomes. Richardson [ [33](#B33-sports-05-00079)] discussed whether RCT designs, representing the research paradigm of reductionism, are an appropriate approach to study effects from complementary therapies, instead suggesting mixed methods designs involving both objective measures of effect and qualitative inquiry into the individual's subjective experience as more suitable for complementary therapy research. The qualitatively generated information can be used to develop theoretical models that illustrate cancer patients' determination process, as well as to generate new hypotheses that can be tested in meaningful quantitative studies. A meta-synthesis of 26 qualitative studies on cancer patients' experience of using complementary therapies, including mind-body techniques, revealed that the patients experienced the complementary therapies as a niche of control in a time of uncertainty, contributing to the restoration of contact between body and mind, and to the development of social relationships [ [34](#B34-sports-05-00079)]. [35](#B35-sports-05-00079)]. Interrelated factors such as treatment side effects, time constraints, and lack of support have been found to negatively affect exercise adherence [ [36](#B36-sports-05-00079)]. [18](#B18-sports-05-00079)], while the more yoga classes completed, the more likely QoL will be enhanced [ [24](#B24-sports-05-00079)]. Lally et al. [ [37](#B37-sports-05-00079)] found great variation (range: 18-254 days, mean: 66 days) in how long it took for a health behavior to be performed automatically, and considered adopted by the individual. Raghavendra et al. [ [38](#B38-sports-05-00079)] identified regularity of attendance at yoga classes to significantly predict patient QoL during chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. Speed-Andrews et al. [ [39](#B39-sports-05-00079)] studied determinants of Iyengar yoga class attendance among breast cancer survivors within the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), and identified the women's intentions, self-efficacy and attitudes as significantly predicting yoga adherence. Similar results have been found in a recent meta-analysis [ [36](#B36-sports-05-00079)] on predictors of exercise adherence among cancer populations, establishing intentions and perceived behavioral control as the most significant TPB constructs. The TPB can be a useful framework for future mind-body exercise interventions in cancer care and rehabilitation. [12](#B12-sports-05-00079)]. It builds on conclusions from reviews of a total of 142 original mind-body exercise trials, including 123 RCTs. Nevertheless, limitations must be taken into consideration. Even though our literature search was comprehensively performed in multiple databases using Medical and CINAHL subject headings, and supplemented with hand-searching of reference lists, we might have missed relevant review articles, and publication bias cannot be ruled out. The search was performed in all five databases simultaneously. Searching the databases one by one could have allowed for a more accurate search. We limited our search to the search fields of title and abstract, which excludes articles lacking the search terms in the selected search fields. Overview studies are prone to overlap on included studies between the reviews and meta-analyses [ [28](#B28-sports-05-00079)]. In the present overview, this well may be the case, especially concerning the meta-analyses of yoga studies, since Kelley and Kelley [ [9](#B9-sports-05-00079)] included five of the studies in their overview study. Although our review largely confirms the findings of Kelley and Kelley [ [9](#B9-sports-05-00079)], the issue of overlap calls for caution in interpreting the results. [12](#B12-sports-05-00079)]. Three of eleven included reviews reported from a mix of complementary therapies [ [15](#B15-sports-05-00079), [16](#B16-sports-05-00079), [21](#B21-sports-05-00079)]. The complexity of therapies might compromise the differentiation between effects from yoga, tai chi chuan or qigong, and could potentially affect the conclusions of the overview study. Consequently, two full-text papers had to be removed from the analysis [ [40](#B40-sports-05-00079), [41](#B41-sports-05-00079)]. However, consistent reporting of findings in the remaining review articles enabled extraction of effects from the specific therapies of interest. [42](#B42-sports-05-00079)]. Mind-body exercise styles in the included review studies showed great variation, and none of the reviews distinguished the change in effect size between the different yoga, tai chi chuan and qigong styles used in the trials. Although not interchangeable, the different mind-body styles share common elements of physical postures, movements, controlled breathing and meditation [ [43](#B43-sports-05-00079)]. Also, a more consistent reporting on the intervention mode could aid conclusions on what types of mind-body exercise therapies could have the greatest impact on quality of life in breast cancer survivors [ [23](#B23-sports-05-00079)]. [44](#B44-sports-05-00079)]. Although a comprehensive search for literature should be applied (ref. AMSTAR domain 4), allowing for inclusion of reports of any publication type (i.e., grey literature), it is difficult to predict the value of including such publications in a systematic review [ [42](#B42-sports-05-00079)]. Only the study of Cramer et al. [ [23](#B23-sports-05-00079)] used visual interpretation of funnel plots in assessing publication bias (ref. AMSTAR domain 10). This method is widely used but can be criticized for being too subjective, raising questions about its utility [ [10](#B10-sports-05-00079)]. AMSTAR domain (5) yielded zero points across included reviews, mainly due to the fact that this domain holds a certain similarity to domain (6), and may appear difficult to apply in its current state. Future use of the AMSTAR could benefit from domain (5) solely targeting excluded studies. In all of the included meta-analyses, significant heterogeneity was detected and debated of QoL outcome measurements, intervention modes and timing and diverse patient demographics, which might compromise the conclusions on effects from mind-body therapies. 5.
