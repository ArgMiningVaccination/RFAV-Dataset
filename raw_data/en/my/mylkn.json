The practice of herbal medicine continuesto be important in the culture of communities across the globe. An estimated four billion people living in developing countries (80% of the world s population) depend upon herbal medicine as a primary healthcare source [1]. The use of herbal medicine inhighly developed countries has increased in recent years ashealthcare costs rise. Individuals have begun to self-medicate withherbal supplements, complement their traditional practices, orutilize alternative practices such as Chinese herbal medicine, Ayur- vedic medicine, and homeopathy [2]. In the 1990s, herbal medical drugs represented 40% of all healthcare services delivered in China. In other countries, an esti-mated 48% (Australia), 70% (Canada), 42% (USA), 38% (Belgium), and 75% (France) of each respective nation s population had used herbal drugs at least once [1]. In a 2007 NHIS report, almost 40% of adults surveyed had used alternative medical therapy in thepast year. Survey results showed that alternative medicine was commonly used to treat back pain, head or chest colds, neck pain, joint pain, anxiety, or depression. The most commonly used alter-native medical therapy was consuming \"nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products \". Some of the most popular herbal products used were Echinacea ,g i n s e n g , Ginkgo ,a n ds a wp a l m e t t o[ 3 ] . These nonvitamin, nonmineral, natural products a ccount for the majority of out-of-pocket expenses for alternative medicine. InAuthors Amy Hudson1*, Elizabeth Lopez1*, Ahmad J.

In the United States,the Food and Drug Administration has a limited scope of reg-ulation over marketed herbal dietary supplements, which maycontain toxic botanical compounds that pose a public healthrisk. While the Food and Drug Administration has made ef-forts to prohibit the sale of unsafe herbal dietary supple-ments, numerous reports have proliferated of adverse events due to these supplements. This literature review investigates bioactive plant compounds commonly used in herbal dietarysupplements and their relative toxicities. Using primarily theNational Library of Medicine journal database and SciFinderfor current reports, 47 toxic compounds in 55 species from46 plant families were found to demonstrate harmful effectsdue to hepatic, cardiovascular, central nervous system, anddigestive system toxicity. This review further contributes a novel and comprehensive view of toxicity across the botanical dietary market, and investigates the toxicity of the top ten bo-tanical dietary supplements purchased in the United States ofAmerica to gauge the exposure risk of toxicity to the public.The criteria of measuring toxicity in this review (plant com-pound, family, quantity, and toxicity effects) across the entiremarket in the United States, with special attention to thosesupplements whose exposure to the consumer is maximal, provides a unique contribution to the investigation of botani- cal supplements.A Review of the Toxicity of Compounds Found in Herbal Dietary Supplements * These two authors contributed equally to this work.Reviews 613H u d s o nAe ta l .

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. the 2007 NHIS report, those who use alternative medicine spent $14.8 billion on these products [4]. In the USA, sales have increased by $6 billion between 2007 and 2012. Furthermore, the botanical dietary supplement ma rket in the USA is expected to increase further in worth by 2020 as dis- ease prevention and healthier living becomes a top concern formany Americans [5]. This industry is regulated to a limited extent in the USA. Con- gress passed the DSHEA of 1994 to amend the 1958 Food Addi- tive Amendments of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act.Due to this act of legislation, many dietary supplements containingredients not recognized by DSHEA as a traditional nutrient,thus, allowing dietary supplement manufacturers to bypass FDAregulations [2]. Before new drugs and food additives are released on to the market, they must undergo lengthy, rigorous testing to prove product safety and efficacy. Product efficacy is investigated through human trials to demonstrate that the product will havethe claimed effect on its label. These tests, along with the expenseof applying to the FDA, are quite costly, and this cost presents it-self to the customer at the retail counter. Botanical dietary supple-ment manufacturers are not mandated to undergo FDA testing;thus, this is a cost saving to the manufacturer and customer. Bo-tanical supplements are generally much less expensive than West- ern medicine, providing another reason for botanical dietary sup- plements to be an attractive alternative or complement to West-ern medicine. However, in 2011, the FSMA was passed and raised the safety standards for new ingredients in dietary supplements. Dietarysupplement manufacturers must notify the FDA in advance whena new dietary ingredient will be included in a product. Dietarysupplement manufacturers must now provide evidence of safety of any new dietary ingredients in order to prevent consumer health from being put at risk [6].Although supplement manufacturers are not mandated to undergo FDA testing, manufacturers are recommended to pro-vide scientific evidence to support any claims made in product la-beling and advertisements. Since DSHEA was passed in 1994, theFDA has identified problems with supplements, and manufac-turers have warned about and recalled possible harmful products[2], such as Aristolochia and comfrey. In 2004, botanical supple- ments containing ephedrine alkaloids were banned by the FDA due to the increased risk of stroke, heart attack, and death [7]. Furthermore, the FDA has also issued advisories on entire fam- ilies of dietary supplements containing specific active ingredients.For example, the FDA issued an advisory in 2014 warning all man-ufacturers of supplements containing comfrey, a plant discussedin this literature, to remove this ingredient from their products.According to the FDA, the pyrrolizidine alkaloids within the herbshow substantial evidence for hepatotoxicity and therefore are unsafe for ingestion [8]. This advisory proves the necessity for re- search and literary review in identifying hazardous dietary supple-ment ingredients that may call the FDA to attention and imple-ment reform to their distribution. Despite this increased risk, the general public, both in the USA and across the world, views herbal medicine as a natural approachto healing. Many assume these natural products are not toxic, anddo not consider the possible adverse effects of improper use and unrestrained intake. Some of the botanical supplements used as herbal medicine are derived from plants not typically used for hu-man consumption. Therefore, the safety and efficacy of theseplants remain untested. For example, saw palmetto extracts havebeen shown to improve male urological symptoms with low ad-verse events compared to the prescription drug finasteride usedto treat these symptoms. However, the long-term effects andoverall effectiveness have yet to be determined [2]. Additionally, the increase in herbal product usage in populations that also have ready access to conventional medicines (drugs) and poly-pharmacy warrants more consideration of the potential for herb-drug interactions [9]. The lack of information among botanical dietary supplement manufacturers coupled with the general public sl a c ko fr i s k awareness can lead to the development of severe poisoning andacute health problems in herbal medicine users [1]. In this literature review, we have compiled 49 known toxic compounds present in 53 different plant species belonging to39 plant families with various adverse effects such as hepatotoxic-ity, cardiovascular toxicity, and central nervous system effects.The purpose of this review is to provide a succinct summary ofknown toxicity levels, usage limits, and possible health risks asso-ciated with medicinal plants and extracts derived from plantsranging across the entire herbal supplement market. Further- more, the potential toxicity levels have been investigated for the top ten botanical dietary supplements available to consumers inthe USA in order to more accurately gauge the public consumer s exposure to these toxicities. As more toxic compounds in herbalmedicine undergo testing and more data becomes availablethrough academic research, supplement manufacturers can makesafer products, and the general public can make more informedhealth decisions.ABBREVIATIONS ALT alanine aminotransferase AMI acute myocardial infarction DSHEA Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act B.

Methods To compile this literature review, PubMed, EBSCO, and SciFinder (Table 1 ) were primarily used to conduct searches about toxic- ity levels of plant compounds found within botanical dietary sup-plements and herbal drugs. Various search terms such as \"toxic plant compounds \",\"herbal supplement adverse effects \",\"plant compound adverse effects \",\"toxic herbal medicine \",\"toxic bo- tanical supplements \",a n d \"toxic alternative medicine \"were used to maximize results. Furthermore, the scientific names of the topten botanical dietary supplements on the market were paired withthese terms to investigate the potential toxicity of products mostfrequently consumed by the public. sug- gested that a specific plant species or plant compound had possi-ble toxicity, PubMed was utilized to verify the claim by searching\"(suggested plant or compound) AND toxic \". If several journal ar- ticles corroborated the claim, the plant compound was includedin the review. The majority of sources were derived from articlespublished in the past ten years (since 2007), while one sourcewas published in 1984 and another source was published in 1976. For a plant compound to be included in the review, these four elements were considered vital:An identifiable compound within the plant species or botanical dietary supplement that has been connected to the toxic ef-fects observed The identity of the plant family and species from which the toxic compound originates The amount of the plant compound/plant species/botanical dietary supplement that was consumed when the toxic effects were observed A description of the toxic effects observed Many articles lacked one or more of the elements described above. When this occurred, attempts were made to find the miss-ing information through other database searches and using planttoxicology reference books to identify compounds and their le vels in plant species. Several sources, however, had to be excluded from the study due to lack of compliance to at least one of theaforementioned criteria. Secondary sources for this literature review included plant tox- icology textbooks, reports from U. S. and European federal agen-cies, and databases such as NAPRALERT. Two tables have beencreated from the sources accumulated from this review to organ-ize the information resulting from the aforementioned searches: one table detailing the potential toxicity levels from adverse events of the top ten most sold botanical dietary supplementson the US market, and another table detailing the information ob-tained from sources regarding the toxicity of plant compoundsacross the botanical supplement market ( Tables 2 and 3,r e - spectively).Results The possible toxic compounds were placed into categories basedupon their effects. The most common effect was hepatotoxicity(15 compounds) followed by cardiovascular toxicity (12 com-pounds), digestive system toxicity (5 compounds), nervous sys-tem toxicity (6 compounds), renal toxicity (4 compounds), repro-ductive toxicity (3 compounds), endocrine toxicity (1 compound),and dermatological toxicity (1 compound) ( Tables 2 and 3). Twenty-three human trials and twenty-seven animal studies were accumulated in this search. Plants and plant constituents associated with hepatotoxicity The fifteen compounds known to be hepa totoxic are present in 20 plant species and 16 plant families. The anthraquinone emodinwas found to be the most toxic of these compounds. Emodin is present in Frangula alnus Mill., a member of the Rhamnaceae fam- ily, and A. barbadensis Miller, commonly called aloe vera, a mem- ber of the Asphodelaceae family. Hepatocyte viability decreasedby 30 -45% when mice were orally given 40 and 80 \u00b5M of pure emodin extract for 24 h [11]. Clinical reports of acute toxic hepa-titis in humans have been reported [12 -14]. Although, two re- search teams suspect that a hypersensitive immune response isresponsible for the induction of hepatitis due to the patients ele- vated levels of eosinophils [12,14]. However, one clinical case study detailed a woman s development of hepatitis after orally consuming 500 mg of aloe vera leaf powder every 2 -3 days for 5 years. After being admitted to the hospital and stopping theconsumption aloe vera, her liver function returned to normal [12]. Overconsumption of emodin has been shown to elevate liver enzyme concentrations along with other adverse effects, such asseizures, nephritis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and dyspnea. However, the genus Senna contains emodin, and a maximum daily oral intake has been established for senna-based products at34.4 mg [15]. In vitro studies suggest that emodin significantly in- hibits critical pathways in these cells, such as Toll-like receptors,MAPK, and NF- B pathways [16]. According to the for Complementary and Inte- grative Health [17], Ginkgo biloba L. of the Ginkgoaceae family, and commonly known as ginkgo, has not been linked to liver in- jury. Sometimes, ginkgo has even been used to treat various forms of liver injury. As stated previously, ginkgo can inhibit liverTable 1 Sources used in the literature search.

Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. enzyme activity in vitro , but when consumed by humans, ginkgo does not impact drug metabolism [18]. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids riddelliine symphytine are com- Symphytum officinale , commonly known as comfrey. This plant species is a member of the Boraginaceae fam-ily. When rats were orally given 10 mg/kg body weight for 5 daysper week for 13 weeks, the animals experienced hepatopathy[19]. In one case study, a woman drank as much as 10 cups of comfrey herb tea in one day, along with taking comfrey pills, and developed hepatic veno-occlusive disease [20]. According to theU. S. National Library of Medicine s LiverTox database [21], cases of acute liver injury have been reported, usually beginning after1 to 2 months of consuming comfrey. However, the databasestates comfrey hepatotoxicity is rare because consumption ofcomfrey is restricted or banned in many countries due to theknowledge of possible liver injury [21]. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are also known liver toxicity demonstrated by these plants, pyrrolizidine alkaloids are bannedin the USA and limited in Europe to 100 \u00b5g per day externally or1 \u00b5g per day internally for no more than 6 weeks [22]. However,the European Medical Agency s Committee of Herbal Medical Products [23] recommends a daily intake of no more than 0.35 \u00b5g per day to avoid the risk of long-term toxicity affects. Usnic acid is a dibenzofuran derivative present in Usnea barbata (L.) F. H. Wigg. of the Parmeliaceae family. Mice and rats were oral-ly given 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight during a 2-week study.These animals experienced liver toxicity. Human case studies haveshown that taking 500 mg of usnic acid for 2 weeks can induceliver failure [24]. NDGA is an antioxidant compound present in Larrea tridentata of the Zygophyllaceae family and is commonly known as creosote bush. Human case reports suggest that consuming 0.3 -6 g daily ofL. tridentata tablets can lead to toxic liver damage with jaundice. In guinea pigs, a lethal oral dose of NDGA is 0.8 g/kg body weight[25, Chelidonium majus L. of the Papaveraceae family, also known as greater celan- dine. The presentation of hepatitis after celandine use has been mentioned in several human case studies [27 -29]. Menthofuran is a compound present in pennyroyal oil, from Mentha pulegium orHedeoma pulegioides of the family Labia- tae. Rats were orally given 250 mg/kg of pennyroyal oil once dailyfor 3 days. These rats experienced hepatotoxicity [30]. Consump-tion of 30 mL or more of pennyroyal oil can cause hepatitis, lead-ing to further liver dysfunction in humans [31]. Flavocoxid is a proprietary blend of baicalin and calin is a compound Baicalin has shown hepatoprotective activity in multiple animal and in vitro experiments [32]. EGCG is present in green tea extract, and it isbelieved that EGCG is responsible for hepatotoxicity attributed togreen tea extract. EGCG is also present in flavocoxid, and re-searchers infer this catechin is responsible for liver injury causedby flavocoxid as well [32]. Limbrel is a flavocoxid commercial product derived from the bioflavonoids baicalin and catechinsthat have been ground into tablets. When humans orally consume 250-500 mg of Limbrel twice daily, bilirubin and liver enzymes become elevated [32]. When human participants orally consumed 400 g of Catha edulis (khat) leaves (of the Celastraceae family) daily for a week (a dose demonstrative of frequent use of the leaves as a supple-ment), studies showed decreased activity of CYP2D6, a liver en-zyme involved in metabolism [33]. The stimulant cathinone is a monoamine alkaloid present in the leaves of khat. In other case reports, toxic effects of khat use appear years later with elevatedliver enzymes and aminotransferase levels, indicating the pres-ence of liver damage [34]. An Australian case report [34] suggeststhat khat-associated hepatitis may be due to an autoimmune re-sponse. Khat is native to East Africa, and according to one paper[35], no khat-induced hepatitis has been reported. The toxicitymay be the result of contaminants used to preserve khat during exportation, or hepatitis may be caused by individual abuse of drugs and alcohol [35]. Notably, the legal restriction on khat dis-tribution commercially in the USA may limit its use by the publicconsumer [36]; however, improvised preparations and its useelsewhere highlight it as a supplement for investigation in this re-view. Linamarin is a cyanogenic glucoside present in Manihat esculen- known as cassava. The plant is often con- sumed in the West African food known as gari. Dogs were given 100 g/kg of gari over 14 weeks and liver vacuolation was observedin the test subjects [37]. Cassava is known as a cause of nonalco-holic chronic pancreatic disease in developing nations [38]. Safrole, phenylpropene and Foeniculum vulgare , commonly known as fennel. This plant has been used by the public primarily through sassafras essential oil. In one study, rats consumed sassafras oil as 0.117% of their diet or safrole as 0.039% of their diet for 2 years. Researchers calcu-lated this would be the equivalent to humans consuming sassafrasoil/safrole for 68 years. Among many adverse effects observed,hepatocarcinomas developed on the test subjects [39]. Alpha- and beta-turmerones are active compounds present in the essential oil of C. longa (Zingiberaceae), commonly called tur- meric. In a rat model study, oral administration of 2.8 mg/kg per day resulted in elevated serum ALT in the liver, indicating the pres- ence of liver damage [40]. W. somnifera , commonly known as ashwagandha and a mem- ber of the nightshade family, is commonly used as an herbal sup-plement in Ayurvedic medicine. In one clinical study, consump-tion of 330 -440 mg a day for 6 weeks resulted in mild epigastric burning, as well as an increase in liver enzymes (SGPT and SGOT),indicating hepatic distress [41]. Estragole is an alkenylbenzene derived from F. vulgare ,c o m - monly known as fennel, of the Apiaceae family. Estragole has beenknown to induce hepatomas in rodents at high doses. These tu-mors are caused by the bioactivation by cytochrome P450s andsulfotransferases, giving rise to the ultimate carcinogenic metab-olite 1 -sulfooxyestragole, which forms DNA adducts [42]. Indeed, in vitro studies of growing cell lines of human hepatomas have de- termined that activation of CYP1A2 and CYP2A6 enzymes ulti- mately lead to the formation of 1 -sulfooxyestragole, which is un- 621H u d s o nAe ta l .

The margin of ex-posure of alkenylbenzenes such as estragole and safrole to cyto-toxicity due to fennel consumption was calculated at 1.9 - 15.8 mg per day to be less than 10, meaning that daily intakewas enough to cause gen otoxicity and carcinogenic events in ex- perimental animals, indicating the risk to human health and prior-ity for risk management [43, 44]. Plants and plant constituents associated with cardiovascular toxicity The literature has indicated that 12 compounds are known to ex- hibit cardiovascular toxicity. These compounds belong to 12 plantspecies and 9 families. Ephedrine is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants within the genus Ephedra (Ephedraceae). Ephed- rine is a bronchodilator used to prevent low blood pressure during spinal anesthesia. Ephedrine is also found in dietary supplementsthat promote short-term weight loss, but those are now illegal inthe USA. However, in traditional Chinese medicines that containsephedrine (ma-huang), it is legal. The ephedrine quantity in dietary supplements taken orally is about 20 mg per serving, and doses are taken up to two to threetimes per day. It has been shown that labels of dietary supple- ments do not list ephedrine content, or incorrectly report the amount of ephedrine in these products [45]. Ephedrine has been associated with cardiovascular dysfunction such as myocardial infarction, severe hypertension, myocarditis,and lethal cardiac arrhythmias [46]. The typical dose of ephedrineused for bronchodilation is 25 -50 mg, but ephedrine doses asso- ciated with adverse events were less than this amount. Four selected case studies were featured in the Haller and Be- nowitz paper [47]. One patient consumed a dietary supplement (Shape-Fast Plus) for 1 week and suffered a subarachnoid hemor-rhage. Shape-Fast Plus was taken as a capsule three times a daybefore meals for weight loss. Each capsule contained 12 mg ofephedra alkaloids, along with 40 mg of caffeine. Another patientsuffered a hemorrhagic stroke 90 min after consuming UltimateOrange, a drink containing 415 mg of ephedra alkaloids and caf-feine. This patient had also run 3 miles before the hemorrhagic stroke occurred. The last two cases feature a dietary supplement known as Ripped Force. Both patients went into cardiac arrest.The first patient was on asthma medications (albuterol and theo-phylline) and had consumed an 18-oz. bottle of Ripped Force be-fore cardiac arrest occurred. The patient was drinking up to threeRipped Force bottles a day for an undisclosed amount of time.Each 18-oz. drink contained 20 mg of ephedra alkaloids, 100 mgof caffeine, 250 mg of L-carnitine, and 240 \u00b5g of chromium. The interaction of the theophylline and albuterol medications with the caffeine and ephedra in Ripped Force caused an arrhythmiathat induced cardiac arrest. The next patient had taken twoRipped Force capsules each morning for 1 year. Each capsule con-tains 10 mg of ephedrine and 100 mg of caffeine. After a 20-minjog and consuming Ripped Force capsules for 1 year, this patientcollapsed suffering a cardiac arrest, resulting in death. A casestudy by Haller and Benowitz indicates that caffeine \"enhancesthe cardiovascular and central nervous system effects of ephed- rine\"[47]. Aconitine is a toxic compound Aconitum (Ranuncula ceae). Aconitum carmichaeli Debx. is a plant commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. The prepared main root iscalled chuan wu ,a n d fu zi is the prepared lateral root. These roots are prepared by boiling this herb for several hours. Poisoning hasoccurred when either the unprepared dried herb was consumed, herbs were boiled for an insufficient amount of time, or patients overdosed [48]. The lethal oral dose of A. carmichaeli prepared roots for humans is estimated to be 3 -6 mg. However, severe poi- soning has been reported after consuming anywhere from 0.2 mgto 6 g orally. Poisoning symptoms include nausea, vomiting,numbness, irregular heartbeat, and cold extremities [48]. Aconi- tum pendulum Busch is a plant that is consumed either as a raw plant or contained in medicinal wine. The estimated human lethal dose of the raw aconite plant is 1 g or 5 mL of medicinal wine. Overdoses related to this plant induced heart arrest due to its ef-fect on voltage-gated sodium channels. The changes in sodiumchannels have been linked to aconitine [48]. Furthermore, aconi-tine has been known to inhibit the binding of acetylcholine andepinephrine to cholinergic and adrenergic receptors, respectively,in cardiac which may contribute to arrhythmic heartcontraction [49]. Strychnine is a toxic, crystalline alkaloid that is most commonly found in the seeds of Strychnos nux-vomica L. (Loganiaceae). Strychnine causes its toxicity by interfering \"with post-synaptic in- hibition mediated by glycine in the brain and spinal cord \"[50]. Although strychnine is an ingredient in rodent poison, it is alsoused in Tibetan medicine and Chinese folk medicine. If 30 - 120 mg of strychnine are consumed, it can be deadly toxic. In cer-tain instances, children have consumed less than 10 mg and adults have consumed less than 16 mg, resulting in fatalities [50]. In one fatal case study, a patient ingested taupicine, a molepoison that was 10% strychnine. The the pa-tient contained oons of strychnine (along with 15 mg of methocarbamol), and 0.8 mg/L of strychnine was found in thepatient s blood sample. After ingesting strychnine, the patient ex- hibited tachycardia, hypertension, and intense muscle spasms [51]. Neriine, oleandrin, folinerin, and digitoxigenin are cardiac gly- cosides found in a number of plants that are commonly known asoleander, including Nerium (Apocynaceae). These cardiac glycosides are found in all parts of the plant. A 21-year-old female consumed 10 -20 N. oleander leaves, resulting in confusion, flushing, diarrhea, and hypokalemia. The treating physicians estimated the lethal dose of oleander leaves to be 4 g. They formulated this estimation from the assumed volume of distribution of the glycosides in oleanderleaves (1 L/kg) and the calculated lethal dose absorbed by theirpatient [52, 53]. Case studies with similar results have been re-ported [52 -54]. These cardiac glycosides work by inhibiting Na +/K+ATPase pumps, causing an accumulation of intracellular sodium in myo-cytes. This increase in intracellular sodium inhibits the exchange of sodium and calcium, resulting in an increase of intracellular cal- 622H u d s o nAe ta l .

The change in calcium concentration decreases the heart rate and enhances cardiac contraction. All of these changes canresult in conduction block, ventricular arrhythmias, and asystole[55]. Through searching various databases, known toxic concentra- tions of the individual cardiac glycosides mentioned could not beidentified. This may be due to the scant commercial availability ofoleander to the consumer in USA markets. This is an area of re- search that warrants further investigation since various decoc- tions of oleander preparations are available online [56]. Yohimbine is an indole alkaloid that is found in the bark of the Pausinystalia yohimbe tree (Rubiaceae). Supplements containing yohimbine have been marketed as products that can improve sex-ual function, but certain dosages can increase or decrease system-ic blood pressure. In human clinical trials of yohimbine hydro-chloride, doses of 20 to 40 mg resulted in a moderate increase in blood pressure, and doses over 45 mg increased mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Yohimbine compounded was given in hu-man and animal trials. After humans were given 5 -15 mg, bipolar disorder patients exhibited manic symptoms, while other patientsexperienced lupus-like syndrome and bronchospasms. In animalstudies with mice, the oral lethal dose was determined to be43 mg/kg [57]. Citrus aurantium (Rutaceae) is the source of bitter orange ex- tract. After the FDA banned ephedra from weight loss supple- ments, many manufacturers began using bitter orange extractand guarana as substitutes. Two of the active components in bit-ter orange extract are synephrine and N-methyltyramine. Syn-ephrine is the main ingredient thought to enhance weight lossby suppressing appetite and boosting metabolism. Synephrine isalso known to cause \"vasoconstriction and spasms in the coronary arteries, increasing heart rate and blood pressure \"[58]. The amount of synephrine in these products varies from 1% to 30%. Another active component, N-methyltyramine, increases bloodpressure due to increasing norepinephrine release [58]. The com-bining effects of these two components may cause potential car-diotoxicity. In a case study, one patient had orally consumed 300 mg of bit- ter orange extract daily and suffered an AMI. The treating physi-cians suspected bitter orange extract was the cause of it. Re- searchers advise that more evidence about the safety of this ex- tract and its components be provided before these supplementsare purchased over-the-counter [58]. Helenalin, is Helenalin, sesquiter- pene lactone, is a in Arnica montana (Compositae), which inhibits platelet aggregation. In one case study, a patienthad dissolved dried flowers in oil and topically applied them toheal bruises. Then, the patient ingested the flowers in a cup of tea. Two hours after drinking the tea, the patient experienced tachycardia, watery emesis, and epigastric tenderness. After re-ceiving intravenous fluids and antiemetics, (Zingiberaceae), previously de- for its hepatotoxic qualities, has also presented acute ane-mia when 2.6 mg/kg per day were administered orally to rats. In-adequate oxygenation in this case may, therefore, pose a keen cir- culatory risk in human cases [40].Caffeine derived from Paullinia cupana , commonly known as guarana of the Sapindaceae family, is an ingredient commonlyused in energy drinks and beverages. In a clinical trial, eighthealthy adults received a single dose of 200 mg caffeine after anovernight fast. After plasma and urine samples were obtained,and heart rate and blood pressure were monitored for 14 h, itwas found that blood pressure increased significantly to a maxi-mum of 14 mmHg. In addition, metabolic clearance was slowed in those patients taking oral contraceptives, indicating that drug- botanical interactions could pose a greater risk for toxicity due tocaffeine [60]. In one study, active fractions from dried guaranaseed extract used in soft drinks were subject to liquid-chromatog-raphy mass-spectroscopy and analyzed for content. It was sug-gested that complexes containing caffeine and catechins (andtheir dimers) might be responsible for antiplatelet aggregatoryactivity, which may be causing such a drastic increase in blood pressure [61]. Plants and plant constituents associated with toxicity to the digestive system Five plant compounds and eight plant species from seven plant families were found to cause toxicity events. Menthofuran, a compound mentioned previously in this review as hepatoxic, has also been found to induce adverse effects on the digestive system. M. pulegium , (Lamiaceae), naturally produces menthofuran. Menthofuran is found in many essential oils, includ-ing pennyroyal. Case studies have shown that ingesting 10 mL orless of pennyroyal oil can cause gastritis [31]. Emodin is another compound categorized as hep atotoxic, but has effects on the digestive system as well. This compound isfound in A. barbadensis (Asphodelaceae), known as aloe vera. The National Toxicology Program conducted toxicity studies on vari- ous plant extracts. When rats were orally given aloe vera whole, nondecolorized extracts, a dose-related incr ease in mucosal perplasia in the large intestine occurred, while nonneoplastic le-sions in the large intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes were alsoobserved. The emodin content of the aloe whole leaf extract is es-timated to be 70.5 \u00b5g/g. Researchers suggest the intestinal tu-mors developed due to the anthraquinone emodin being trans-formed into mutagenic components in the intestine. The recom- mended dose per day for humans is 0.43 mg/kg or about 10 - 30 mg/day [62]. According to the U. S. National Library of Medi-cine Toxicology Data Network, mild toxic overdoses of emodincan induce vomiting and diarrhea, but severe overdoses can resultin gastrointestinal hemorrhage [15]. For example, in one experi-ment, oral administration of 100 mg/kg whole leaf aloe extract re-sulted in vomiting and diarrhea [63 -64]. Scutellaria baicalensis , a member of the Lamiaceae family, is commonly known as Chinese skullcap. A 5 g/kg extract of Chinese skullcap was given to dogs over an 8-week period, and loose stoolwas observed as a result. Diarrhea and stomach discomfort havebeen observed in human case reports. Dose and preparation, un-fortunately, were not reported [65]. NDGA is a compound that has been previously discussed in this paper for its hepatotoxic activity. When NDGA was isolated, it in-duced abnormalities in the gastrointestinal tract. Rats received an oral administration of NDGA extract for 74 weeks (0.5 or 1% of the 623H u d s o nAe ta l . AR e v i e wo f ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 613 -626 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. extract was NDGA). After these administrations, mesenteric lymph node cysts developed in the test subjects. In another study,rats were given an extract (0.5% of the extract was NDGA) for2 years. Following this time period, inflammatory cecal lesionsand cyst enlargement occurred [25]. These findings correspondwith reports of renal and hepatotoxicity in humans after long-term use of NDGA and its origin, L. tridentata [26]. Lobeline is an found known as \"Indian tobacco \".L. inflata is a member of the Campanulaceae family. Lobeline is found in the leaves and seeds of this plant.When commercially sold, lobeline is present in a 1-mg per unitdosage. When humans consume 8 mg of lobeline, nausea and epi-gastric pain was reported [66]. Lobeline has been known as a lig-and for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors that competitively inhib-its acetylcholine binding tissue to induce peri-stalsis [67]. Sambucus nigra , commonly known as European the Adoxaceae family. Elderberry leaves, bark, stems,and unripe berries are known to contain cyanogen glycosides,which commonly present toxic events in clinical cases and maypresent in Sambucol, a syrup product made from elderberry juiceconcentrate. Oral consumption in human cases at 11 -12 g daily for 4 -5 days, or 4 tablespoons a day, has resulted in reports of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, weakness, dizziness, numb- ness, and stupor [68]. L. meyenii , commonly known as maca and is a member of the cabbage family, possess a root commonly ground or extracted forhuman consumption as a sexual and reproductive enhancing sup-plement. One active compound attributed to this altered sexualbehavior and reported in toxicity and adverse events includesMTCA. Consumption of a powdered root extract containing MTCAhas resulted in cramps and gastritis [69]. Furthermore, according to a literature review of clinical trials associated with maca, oral consumption of 2.0 -3.5 g per day in the form of 500 mg hard gel powder extract tablets of maca primary leaves for 1 to 3 monthsresulted in weight loss, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting[70]. Plants and plant constituents associated with neurotoxicity Six compounds from six species and six families were associated with neurotoxicity. Thujone is a compound present in Artemisia absinthium (Com- positae) and Salvia officialis (Lamiaceae), commonly known as sage leaf. In 2012, the European Medicines Agency issued a state-ment about the safety of thujone in herbal medicinal products.The EMA concluded the maximum limit of daily oral intake for Ab-sinthii herba was established at 3 mg/person and S. officialis was limited to 5 mg/person. Both herbal products should only be used for 2 weeks maximum. The report assessed that low-dose expo-sure to thujone (3 -7 mg/day) may be safe, but higher concentra- tions of thujone may pose a risk. When rats consumed thujone in higher concentrations (con- centrations of 25 or 50 and greater mg/kg for 13 weeks), seizureswere observed. In other animal studies, rats were given variousdoses of sage essential oil. A lethal (oral) dose was determined tobe 2600 mg/kg. When humans consume higher doses (15 mg), subtle changes in attention and mood were observed [71]. Caulosaponin is present in blue cohosh, Caulophyllum tha- lictroides (Berberidaceae). This compound has been isolated and a lethal dose has been determined. In neonates born to womenwho have taken blue cohosh, perinatal stroke, acute myocardialinfarction, congestive heart failure, multiple organ injury, andneonatal shock have occurred. After orally consuming blue cohosh, patients experienced side effects including diarrhea, in- creased levels of blood pressure and blood glucose, and stomachcramps. These adverse events are believed to be caused by thetoxic alkaloid methylcytisine [72,73]. A biochemical study of theconstituents in blue cohosh revealed that all studied dietary sup-plements of blue cohosh contain N-methylcytisine [74]. The seeds and fruit of guarana ( P. cupana , Sapindaceae) are often a source of caffeine for herbal supplements, as previously mentioned. In a case study, a weight loss supplement contained 2.5-7% caffeine (200 mg/dose). If patients choose to self-medi- cate and increase supplement usage, patients may consume asmuch as 1800 mg of caffeine [74]. The safety limit recommendedby the FDA for daily caffeine consumption is only 400 mg, or theequivalent of four to five cups of coffee [75]. Linamarin, previously featured as a hepatotoxic compound of Manihat esculenta (Euphorbiaceae), has been associated with neu- rotoxicity in animals. In an animal study where cassava-fed ani- mals were compared to control animals, cyanide-fed animals,and malnourished animals, researchers found motor coordinationof the cassava-fed animals was similar to the other groupsstudied. However, the plasma thiocyanate concentration as wellas urinary and elevated urinary protein ex-cretion for the cassava-fed animals differed from all other studiedgroups. Researchers concluded that neurotoxicity could be a result of linamarin [76]. Another study featuring Wistar rats cor- roborates these findings. After consuming doses of 0.075 - 0.3 mg of linamarin in 2 milliliters of cassava juice for 2 weeks,the test subjects experienced and locomotion deficien-cies [77]. L. meyenii , or maca, has been previously mentioned for its di- gestive toxicity. Human consumption of the root extract has alsobeen associated with a significant impact on neurological func- tions, resulting in side effects that include craving behavior, moodiness, and insomnia [69]. Consumption of the primary leafextract in the form of hard gel powder extract tablets at 2.5 - 3.0 g/day for 1 to 3 months has also produced reports of head-aches, attention disturbances, and agitation [70]. W. somnifera (nightshade), previously mentioned for its hepa- totoxic properties, contains the active compound TEG, which ataccidental high concentrations in humans has resulted in coma and metabolic acidosis [78]. Similar neurological toxicity has also resulted upon oral administration to both mouse and rat models(5630 mg/kg/day in rats and 563 mg/kg/day in mice) [79]. Fur-thermore, human consumption of 250 mg and 500 mg 8:1 aque-ous extract W. somnifera tablets at 750 mg/day for 3 days has re- sulted in the adverse events of increased appetite, libido, and hal-lucinogenic effects with vertigo [80]. 624H u d s o nAe ta l .

Plants and plant constituents associated with renal toxicity Aristolochic acids I and II are found in Aristolochia fangchi , a mem- ber of the Aristolochiaceae family. Various animal studies present-ed in Table 3 studied varying concentrations of each aristolo- chic acid and its effect on the body. Low doses produced protein-uria and glucosuria, while an increasing dosage produced necrosisand interstitial fibrosis [81 -83]. In a 1992 human study, over 50% of patients experienced Belgian epidemic-nephropathy upper ur- othelial cancer due to long-term consumption of a weight loss pill.ESRD was also observed in 70% of aristolochic acid-poisoned well glycosuria In1996 case studies, aristolochic acid nephropathy was directly cor-related to Chinese herb nephropathy. Women (age range from27-42) consumed Chinese herbal weight loss pills for 13 -23 months. Renal transplantation was necessary 9 -27 months after the women stopped taking these pills. Patients in these case stud- ies experienced renal and urinary tract degradation symptoms[83]. In another literature review of herbal medicine toxicities, aris- tolochic acid nephropathies such as Fanconi syndrome, renal fail-ure, and tubular necrosis were observed in patients from Taiwan,Japan, and China [84]. Molecular analysis revealed that aristolo-chic acid is responsible for covalently binding to DNA in the nu- cleus, forming AL DNA adducts that cause mutation or transcrip- tion error in protein synthesis that may cause these renal issues,particularly in cases of renal cell carcinoma [85]. Safrole is a com-pound present in sassafras and fennel essential oil that has beenpreviously discussed as hepatotoxic but also has effects on thekidney. Many systemic effects were observed after two differentgroups of rats were administered either sassafras oil or safrole for2 years. Oil comprised 0.117% of the diet in one group, while sub- jects in the second group were given pure safrole, which consti- tuted 0.039% of their diet. Changes in kidney structure werenoted postmortem [39]. Emodin, a toxic anthraquinone present in whole leaf A. barbadensis extract, has also demonstrated evidence for renal toxicity in rat models. In one study, the whole leaf extract admin-istered orally to rats resulted in hypokalemia and renal failure [62]. Plants and plant constituents associated with reproductive toxicity and developmental effects NDGA is a compound that has effects on the digestive and repro- ductive organ systems. NDGA is found leaves of chaparral(L. tridentata A hydroethanolic was administered to hamsters. Numerous ef-fects were observed, including growth retardation, irritability, ag-gressiveness, and hypoplasia of testicles and accessory sex glands [25]. Emodin, mentioned previously for its toxic effects in A. barbadensis , has also demonstrated reproductive toxicity in an animal study. In one rat model, oral administration of 100 mg/kgof whole leaf aloe extract produced reproductive inflammationand toxicity, notably, significant sperm damage [62]. L. meyenii , or maca, has been previously mentioned for its di- gestive and neurological toxicity. MTCA, an active ingredient in the maca root, has also been associated with causing reproductivedistress in the form of altered menstrual cycles [65]. According to a literature review on clinical trials conducted involving maca, oralconsumption of maca at 2.0 -3.5 g/day for 1 to 3 months has re- sulted in adverse side effects of abdominal pain, gingival bleed-ing, and abnormal functioning of estrogen-dependent systems,such as endometriosis and breast cancer [26]. Plants and plant constituents associated with toxicity of the endocrine system Safrole has been reported as hepatotoxic and toxic to kidneys in a study where rats were administered sassafras essential oil (0.117%of diet) or pure safrole (0.039% of diet) for 2 years. Subjects werenoted as also having changes to various endocrine organs, includ-ing adrenals, thyroid, pituitary, and testes or ovaries [39]. Plants and plant constituents associated with dermal toxicity Menthol is a well-known compound present in the Mentha genus of the Lamiaceae family. Mentha piperita (peppermint) is the origin of peppermint leaf essential oil. In a case study, a patient ingestedover 40 drops of peppermint leaf oil, afterwards experiencing achemical burn of the oral cavity and pharynx. The patient alsoshowed tachycardia, tachypnea, and edema of the lips, tongue,and uvula [79]. Discussion In conclusion, based on the case studies and experiments previ-ously mentioned, there is an overwhelmingly vast degree to whichHDSs may induce toxicity events to multiple body systems in bothanimals and humans. A total of 47 known comp ounds in 55 differ- ent plant species from 46 plant families demonstrated harmful side effects due to hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular toxicity, central nervous system toxicity, and digestive system toxicity. Thesestudies provide relevant evidence to both the FDA and to the pub-lic consumer for the growing need of awareness of the degree oftoxicity in HDSs. Furthermore, the accumulation of these studiesspeaks to an immediate need to hold manufacturers of these sub-stances accountable for ensuring that the products they manufac-ture and release to the market do not pose a threat to public health. Moreover, this evidence speaks to the necessity for further in vitro bioassay, animal experimentation, and clinical investiga- tion that may shed further light on the possible toxicity of com-monly used HDSs. While 49 known toxic plant compounds have been observed in this literature review, the investigation into the toxicity of plantsupplements still has ground to cover. While case studies often demonstrate the toxic effects of active plant compounds, there is very little information provided in the literature about the exact minimum toxic or lethal doses in animals and humans. In fact,many studies and sources report only toxicity and adverse eventsresulting from herbal supplements after consumption of dosesmany times higher than the therapeutic doses recommended bysupplement manufacturers. Furthermore, a significant amount ofthe literature considered for this review only established cytotox-icity using in vitro models. Additional studies are needed in order to establish relevancy to humans. Moreover, it may be necessary 625H u d s o nAe ta l . AR e v i e wo f ...Planta Med 2018; 84: 613 -626 This document was downloaded for personal use only. Unauthorized distribution is strictly prohibited. to initiate in vitro bioassays of other dietary supplement ingre- dients that may not show immediate adverse side effects, butare nonetheless very commonly used. These investigations mayreveal as yet unknown toxicities or even advances in efficacy thatthese supplements may pose to public health that are unknown tomanufacturers and/or the FDA. It is also prudent to consider thatadverse events related to the consumption of botanical dietarysupplements and other herbal medicinal drugs may be due to fac- tors that cannot be easily identified by reading product labels for harmful plants or active ingredients. Adverse events may be re-lated to several other factors, such as contamination with adulter-ants in the manufacturing process, ingredients benign by them-selves that may react negatively with each other or other drugs,dosage variability, or the consumers themselves who may consti-tute special populations that may be at risk (i.e., children, preg-nant women) [9]. These factors necessitate further inquiry and re- search to further understand the cause of adverse medical events connected to these products and mitigate prevention of suchevents in the future.
