His anguished lover asks the doctors if there's anything she can do. Despair is taking hold when suddenly the man's eyes open, and he begins to talk. \"My team ... it's a keeper league,\" he says, spitting out the words in his last throes. \"Don't. Trade. Prince. Fielder!\" With that, his vitals go dead, the doctors bring in defibrillator paddles, and the woman starts to wail. An announcer intones: \"Join the endless drama. Play fantasy baseball on ESPN.\" (Click [here](http://www.endlessdrama.com/) to watch the spots.) The purpose of this campaign (it includes a teaser ad that runs on TV, plus several more Webisodes available at [EndlessDrama.com](http://www.endlessdrama.com/)) is to create and retain interest in ESPN's fantasy-baseball leagues. According to the ad agency behind the campaign, the fantasy-baseball season can feel \"long\" and \"daunting\" to some players. Thus the ads\u2014with their references to the \"endless drama\" inherent in fantasy sports\u2014are meant both to fire up excitement for the start of the new season and to encourage players to stick it out for the whole marathon. I'm a decent test case for the campaign. I've played fantasy baseball in the past, and the long season waiting ahead does feel daunting. So daunting, in fact, that this year I finally decided to opt out. I couldn't get jazzed about signing on for another six months of [statistics parsing](http://www.slate.com/id/2187563/). I couldn't summon the passion required to scour the waiver wire, replace injured players, assess daily spreadsheets, and make lots of careful, math-based decisions. It seemed like it might be more fun just to watch some real baseball games on TV. So, did this ESPN campaign work on me? Did it get me psyched up for my league's draft and stoke my fires for another half-year of fantasy \"drama\"? No. (Frankly, by late July, the only drama in my league is over who can come up with the punniest team name. Queer as Foulke? Siouxsie and the Ben Sheets?) But my mind was already made up, and, indeed, my league has now started without me. For people who were still on the fence as this season loomed, it's possible the ads offered a nudge of encouragement. Any habitual fantasy player will enjoy the knowingness of the jokes. The ads get all the details right and are clearly written by people familiar with the ins and outs of nerdball. (In fact, one of the ad-agency creatives involved with the campaign has actually written a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Committed-Confessions-Fantasy-Football-Junkie/dp/0743267575) about playing fantasy football.) References to lopsided trades, shady waiver wire pickups, and \"keeper leagues\" (in which you can carry players over from one season to the next) help establish geek cred. And framing the campaign as a soap opera parody is a clever idea. It puts forth the notion that a season of fantasy baseball offers enough unexpected ups and downs to keep players engaged for months on end (just as a soap buoys along its viewers on a stream of twists and turns). But the trouble with the campaign is that it gets the balance wrong: It's too much about soaps, not enough about baseball. While nailing the parody, it sort of forgets why it's here in the first place. (Perhaps, like a soap character in a head bandage, it has amnesia? Or maybe this is the evil, goateed twin of the real campaign?) Executives at Arnold Worldwide, the agency behind the spots, had originally planned to hire a big-name commercial director to mimic soap opera production values. But then they realized: Why not just get the real thing? Through connections between ESPN and ABC, they enlisted a director from the long-running soap One Life To Live and even filmed on the show's sets. \"The way they shoot soaps is completely different from the commercial world,\" says executive creative director Roger Baldacci. \"The director sits in a control room with lots of monitors. They have three cameras running, and he snaps his fingers to switch cameras and go live to the next one. You're seeing the whole ad happen live [instead of filming one camera angle, stopping to set up the next shot, and then restarting with another camera angle]. The lighting technician sits in the control room, too, and they have every light imaginable on the ceiling of the set. With the push of a button, they can change the lighting. In the commercial world, we would stop for 45 minutes while they set up flags and bounces and the D.P. [director of photography] anguishes over everything.\" Baldacci says they shot all eight ads, plus a lot of ancillary material, in two days. \"The efficiency was incredible.\" Baldacci sounds entranced with his trip to Soapville, but I think this immersion strategy may have backfired a little. Using actual soap crews (and performers\u2014there are actors here on loan from One Life To Live and All My Children) made the soap opera jokes almost more rooted and authentic than the fantasy-baseball jokes. \"There are overdramatic pauses, camera zoom-ins, and other little elements that make it feel right,\" says Baldacci. \"For instance, in a soap, they have a lot of time to let scenes play out, and there's more dead time. So, we let our pacing become much more relaxed than it normally would be in an ad. We trimmed them up a little bit, but we had to fight that urge in order to stay true to the genre.\" My question is: Who in ESPN's target audience will really care how well these ads capture the mood and aesthetics of soaps? I'm sure there are a few dudes out there who are avid fans both of soap opera and of fantasy baseball (though I would advise them not to mention this in their online dating profiles). But the vast majority of dorkball enthusiasts are men with zero interest in daytime melodrama. It occurred to me that perhaps the campaign was an effort to attract more women to ESPN's fantasy leagues, but the agency says this was not its goal. (There are a few million female players, but they make up a small percentage of the fantasy universe.) The ads are funniest when we see real baseball stars thrust into the soap setting. Yankees catcher Jorge Posada does a nice turn as a bartender breaking up a fight. (His wife also appears as a love interest. When I asked if she was an actress, the ad guys described her as \"an aspiring actress.\") But some of the episodes feature no baseball players at all\u2014just the soap actors and maybe a bland ESPN commentator. I can't see how these spots could hold much appeal for a jocky audience. In fact, some Web sleuthing last week suggested that the campaign is stirring up more intense interest on soap opera message boards, where fans are delighting at the chance to see their soap heroes appear in a sports context. Great for the soap fans, but I think ESPN was hoping for the opposite effect. Grade: B-. Almost too well-executed. The ads play so much like real soap scenes that they neglect to do enough spoofing. I did enjoy the \"smack videos\" available at EndlessDrama.com. These are intended to keep you excited about your fantasy league as the season wears on by letting you e-mail unsportsmanlike video clips to your competitors. For instance, you can send a clip of a sexy nurse who offers sympathy to opponents when their star players get injured. \"It's not enough just to win in fantasy sports,\" chuckles Baldacci. \"You have to rub it in.\" The [Pritzker Prize](http://www.pritzkerprize.com/full_new_site/), which this year was awarded to French architect Jean Nouvel, is often referred to as the Nobel Prize of architecture. It is an inaccurate analogy. Nobel Prizes, whether in literature, chemistry, or physics, are given to individuals for individual work; buildings are the result of teamwork. Sometimes Nobels are awarded to small teams of scientists, and researchers do have assistants, but not 140 of them, which is the size of Ateliers Jean Nouvel, whose head office is in Paris but which maintains site offices in London, Madrid, Barcelona, Rome, and Minneapolis. This is not to take anything away from Nouvel, an imaginative if sometimes heavy-handed architect. He deserves credit for assembling\u2014and leading\u2014the talented teams that get his designs built. But teams they are. One of the most striking features of the bullet-shaped Agbar Tower in Barcelona, designed in association with the firm b720 Arquitectos, is its shimmering exterior glass screen. The screen was fabricated by the Italian firm Permasteelisa, one of the leading curtain-wall manufacturers in the world, responsible for some of the most striking walls of recent times\u2014including that of Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, Norman Foster's Hearst Building in New York, and Coop Himmelblau's BMW Welt in Munich. The Pritzker Prize promotes the fiction that buildings spring from the imagination of an individual architect\u2014the master builder. This wasn't true in the Middle Ages, when there were real master builders, and it isn't true today. The modern architect works with scores of specialists, first and foremost structural engineers, without whom most architects today would be lost. Armies of consultants are responsible for everything from acoustics and lighting to energy conservation and security. Fabricators like Permasteelisa manufacture\u2014and influence the design of\u2014specialized building components, and contractors put the whole thing together. Construction has become so complex that responsibility for design and building is commonly split between design architects and so-called executive architects, who oversee the preparation of construction documents and supervise the building process. The international nature of high-profile architectural practices\u2014Ateliers Jean Nouvel is currently building 40 projects in 13 countries\u2014means that local associate firms like b720 Arquitectos also play a key role in the process. Given the messy and unpredictable nature of construction, it is often the person on the building site who makes critical design decisions. The other crucial ingredient for a successful building is the client, not only because he pays for it\u2014though that is no mean contribution, since building costs are notoriously difficult to estimate. It is often said that good buildings require good clients, and great buildings demand great clients\u2014who will support the architect but also challenge him. It is surely no coincidence, as John Silber points out in [Architecture of the Absurd](http://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Absurd-Genius-Disfigured-Practical/dp/1593720270/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207053013&sr=1-1), that Gehry's IAC headquarters building in New York, designed for Barry Diller, is the best work the architect has done in years. The fact that architecture is a team sport is what makes buildings so interesting. Art is often chiefly the reflection of an individual sensibility, but architecture tells us something about the society that produced it, its technology, its values, its taste. In that sense, building buildings is more like making movies than creating personal works of art. The Academy Awards recognize that the auteur theory of filmmaking has little relevance to making major movies; that's why Oscars are awarded in all those categories\u2014art direction, sound mixing, makeup\u2014and why the best-picture prize is given to the producers, not the director, writer, or actors. Perhaps the Pritzker should be given to the \"best building.\" The prize would be picked up by the architect, the engineer, the builder, and, oh yes, the client.

In 1991, when Wong Kar-wai released his dreamy 1960s period piece, Days of Being Wild, he wrote in the director's statement: \"I really do not think it matters much if my films are critically well-received or not. What is essential is that I want my audience to leave the cinema having enjoyed the film, and that means the whole world to me.\" Imagine his frustration, then, when Days was released to resounding critical acclaim and complete commercial failure, as were his next four movies. At some point he must have decided to reverse the formula\u2014valuing critical acclaim over audience enjoyment\u2014because this week his first American film, My Blueberry Nights, arrives in the United States, and it's the cinematic equivalent of seeing Wong disappear up his own posterior, eased by gobs of critical praise. Twenty years ago, his first movie, As Tears Go By, caught lightning in a bottle when Andy Lau pulled Maggie Cheung into a phone booth and passionately made out with her as a Cantonese cover of Berlin's \"Take My Breath Away\" swelled on the soundtrack and the booth's fluorescent lights burned brighter and brighter until they seared the screen white. It was the first \"Wong Kar-wai moment,\" and, in the six movies he made between 1988 and 1997, there would be many more: Faye Wong singing \"Dreams\" by the Cranberries in Chungking Express as a lovelorn cop sipped coffee in slow motion while the world hurled itself around him in fast forward; Frank Zappa's satirical \"I Have Been in You\" transformed into a breakup dirge in Happy Together; the Flying Pickets closing Fallen Angels with their rapturous cover of \"Only You\"; Tony Leung gearing up for a night of breaking hearts while Xavier Cugat's \"Perfidia\" cha-chas in the background of Days of Being Wild. Wong's movies showed how pop songs let us escape the world for a place where emotions are stronger, colors are brighter, and everyone can say exactly how they feel\u2014but for only three minutes at a time. He blended the tragic transience of pop with an aching nostalgia for the eternally ending present, a uniquely Hong Kong attitude. Hong Kong is a city fascinated with the next new thing while simultaneously feeling as cramped and close-knit as a small town. (See Wong's Fallen Angels, in which a hit man escapes a bloody shootout only to run into a high-school classmate.) Most Hong Kongers live a short commute from where they grew up, and everyone knows everybody else, but development happens at the speed of light, and most people's childhood memories have been paved over by the time they're adults. Living in Hong Kong means experiencing a constant, low-level mourning for the way things used to be while rushing at breakneck speed into the future\u2014a lot like living in a Wong Kar-wai film. Wong, his cinematographer, Christopher Doyle, and his art director and editor, William Chang, improvised fast-on-their-feet movies that captured this spirit of Hong Kong. They often pushed the length of scenes beyond the point of the audience's patience, but their highs were so high and their lows so low that it was easy to forgive the sometimes tedious middles. Despite Wong's relentless commercial failure, he quickly became a major force on the Hong Kong filmscape, with his movies spurring trends, getting parodied, getting ripped off, hated, and loved. After Wong won the best-director prize at Cannes for 1997's Happy Together, he took off in a radical new direction. In the Mood for Love (2000) was an oblique tale of a love affair between Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung, and it was to movies what Sting's The Dream of the Blue Turtles was to rock: a clear marker that we were now in the land of the middle-aged and the married. In the Mood was technically accomplished, but previously Wong had mixed reflective stillness with kinetic movement, creating a volatile cinematic experience. In the Mood was all stillness and no movement\u2014it didn't race, it swooned. A weepy violin piece took center stage, with dozens of period pop songs relegated to the background, little more than audio wallpaper. The headlong rush of youth was gone, replaced by the regret of adulthood. The King of Pop had left the building. And the critical praise had never been louder. In the Mood for Love created a new Wong Kar-wai who was the darling of Cannes and a global brand name. But rather than being invigorated by the critical hosannas, he seemed to be paralyzed. He spent years shooting his follow-up, 2046, swiping characters and settings from In the Mood, and the film landed on screens limp and lifeless. Next came his short film The Touch, set in this same 1960s pocket universe, full of cosmetics-caked harpies in lacquered beehives and Tony Leung (plus Tony Leung look-alikes) with oil shining in his hair, smoking endless cigarettes in the shadows. Even his collaborators were getting bored. \"I feel that 2046 is unnecessary, in retrospect,\" Christopher Doyle said to the Guardian. \"I think probably Wong Kar-Wai realized that somewhere, and that's why it took so long. You do realize that you have basically said what you needed to say, so why say more? I think you have to move on.\" But Wong couldn't move on. He had always been fascinated with his childhood in 1960s Shanghai and Hong Kong, and his post-2000 work has been an extension of Days of Being Wild\u2014replicating its cinematography, sets, costume design, and characters. His latest, My Blueberry Nights, is set in contemporary America and should have been a new direction. But it comes off as desperate, playing like a greatest-hits version of his '90s filmography performed by an all-white cover band. His visual motifs of clocks and countertops, no longer carrying the shock of the new, feel as empty and shopworn as fashion advertisements. Even his upcoming projects sound like more of the same. There's a reworked version of his 1994 martial-arts film, Ashes of Time, and while that film deserves the attention, rereleasing it is the decision of a director who's looking backward, not forward. Then he plans to shoot another preserved-in-aspic 1960s film, this time starring Nicole Kidman. For a director who specializes in long, rapturous close-ups of his actors, there's something suicidal in the idea of casting an actress with the least expressive face this side of Steven Seagal. The saddest thing is that the critics who say they love Wong's innovative style and creativity have been praising him for performing the same tricks again and again. Wong Kar-wai's production company, Jet Tone, also seems to be in a middle-age slump. The actor Tony Leung, who has appeared in six of Wong's films, is managed by Jet Tone. But rather than letting Leung age gracefully, the company recently issued airbrushed publicity shots, giving the handsome, middle-aged actor the smooth, inexpressive face of a 12-year-old boy. Leung, in an interview a few years ago, acknowledged that he and Wong seemed to be trapped in a time loop. \"For the past ten years I think we're doing the same movie, starting from Days of Being Wild to 2046 we're somehow doing the same thing. One time we [Wong and I] talked on the set and said we should do something different, at least for the audience.\" But all signs suggest that Wong can't find the energy to break out of his gilded cage. He still has the potential to be the world's most transcendent director, but wake me up when he stops repeating his past movies and attempts something\u2014anything\u2014new. The era of the global nomad seems to have arrived in the United States. Both leading presidential candidates\u2014not just Barack Obama but John McCain, too\u2014grew up shuttling between cultures and learning \"to not build walls around ourselves and to do our best to find kinship and beauty in unexpected places,\" as Obama's sister summed up the sunny cross-cultural credo of the campaign trail. Meanwhile, a pre-eminent chronicler of the hybrid consciousness has emerged as well: Jhumpa Lahiri, a Bengali-American who writes about darker transnational shadows. \"Being a foreigner is a sort of lifelong pregnancy\u2014a perpetual wait, a constant burden, a continuous feeling out of sorts,\" reflects the mother who has been transplanted from Calcutta to Cambridge, Mass., in Lahiri's novel, The Namesake (2003). The same character's husband can't escape an awareness of \"all that was irrational, all that was inevitable about the world.\" The legacy of growing up in the grip of a globally mobile heritage is once again Lahiri's theme in her third book, [Unaccustomed Earth](http://www.amazon.com/Unaccustomed-Earth-Jhumpa-Lahiri/dp/0307265730/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207235153&sr=1-1). In a collection of stories as limpid yet complex as her Pulitzer Prize-winning debut, Interpreter of Maladies (1999), she returns to familiar terrain\u2014most of her Indians are highly educated, upper-middle-class suburbanites on the Boston-New York corridor\u2014and to her well-honed role. Lahiri is an unillusioned anatomist of the greatest immigrant success story in the United States. But this time, she has captured more clearly than ever before a restless feeling of uprootedness that is as representative of America now, in the post-9/11 era, as the credo of wide-eyed openness ever was. Born in Britain in 1967, raised in Rhode Island, and regularly taken on long visits to India, Lahiri grew up feeling, she has written, \"intense pressure to be two things, loyal to the old world and fluent in the new.\" As dutifully high-achieving daughters (never mind immigrants) often do, she mostly felt she failed at both exacting tasks. And it seemed that nobody appreciated her plight. Her father and sari-clad mother, and the Bengali social circle that defined her home sphere, certainly didn't. Nor did her peers, parochially focused on their own American meritocratic dreams. But Lahiri was right in step with a globalizing world. In the late 1990s, she veered off her ethnically correct academic track (B.A. from Barnard, M.A.s from Boston University in English and creative writing, followed by a Ph.D. in Renaissance studies) to embark on fiction about the enigma of Indian-American arrival. By then, accumulated brain drain and boundary crossings and intermarriage had made hyphenated heritages \"part of this country's identity,\" as she put it. Lahiri was already probing the aspirational strains, the blend of professional drive and personal unease, when the World Trade Center towers collapsed. Her subject\u2014the barriers and fears that haunt even the well-off in a newly porous world\u2014had become, in a way, the subject. And her Bengali background bequeathed her a perspective she's been developing ever since. What Lahiri never fails to miss is how the very wariness that isolates her Indians from their American neighbors, and divides custom-bound parents from their anxiously assimilating children, also inspires a common quest for a sense of kinship. In a time when borders\u2014between genders and generations, not just nations\u2014are more permeable than ever, no one can count on feeling fully at home in the world. Assimilation, in Lahiri's fiction, is about coming to terms with disorientation. It is about not fitting in or settling down, not starting over from scratch and freely forging a new identity or destiny. Her characters balance precariously between two worlds\u2014not just Asian and Western, but inner and outer, traditionally circumscribed and daringly improvised, unwilled and willed\u2014and they do so not just transitionally, but permanently. In fact, The Namesake was animated by the counterintuitive insight that the second generation's sense of dislocation can be, in its way, harder to deal with than the full-fledged transplantation traumas of the foreign-born parent pioneers. In her new stories\u2014which have grown longer\u2014Lahiri pursues that theme. In various stages of setting up house, her mostly thirtysomething Bengali-Americans feel half-betrayed yet awed by their parents. Not that they ever let them know. Part of the burden they live with is unspoken ambivalence about elders who, against great odds, managed a feat that daunts their offspring. Well-aware of their own advantages\u2014not least accent-free English and freedom from the old world custom of arranged marriage\u2014these U.S.-born young adults still can't help feeling adrift. Lahiri is a narrator subtly in tune with her poised yet highly sensitive characters. She sets store, as they do, by emotional reserve and a studious display of control\u2014all the while alert, as they mostly are, to powerful tensions coiled beneath the surface. They are well-aware of profound gaps in perspective, yet where they have trouble bridging them, Lahiri excels at just that. In the title story, and in the three linked stories that close the collection, she maps the divergent angles of vision and emotion that obstruct, even as they broaden, her characters' search for a sense of belonging. In \"Unaccustomed Earth,\" 38-year-old Ruma, with a 3-year-old in tow and another baby on the way, has recently moved from Brooklyn to suburban Seattle, where her husband, Adam, takes a new job that has him on the road a lot. It's a classic American scenario, to which Lahiri adds a twist by having Ruma's father pay a visit, alone; Ruma's mother died suddenly the year before. Father and daughter, together and apart, are embarking uneasily on new stages of life untethered by a woman whose traditionalism had cramped yet also anchored them in different ways. Lahiri shifts throughout between Ruma's and her father's points of view, and between oblique Bengali generational strains and the more familiar affluent American family fault lines they can't help resembling. The father, who unbeknownst to his daughter has met a Bengali widow on one of the European tours he has started taking, worries that Ruma risks being marooned in Seattle. He's haunted by echoes of his wife's predicament decades before: \"Like his wife, Ruma was now alone in this new place, overwhelmed, without friends, caring for a young child, all of it reminding him, too much, of the early years of his marriage, years for which his wife had never forgiven him. He had always assumed Ruma's life would be different.\" So, of course, had Ruma, a busy lawyer until recently. But she finds herself peculiarly unmoored without the mother whom she had vowed not to take as her model. Ruma had also assumed that, balking at Bengali custom, she would never want her parents to come live with her. So, she is surprised to end up hoping her father will move in. And she is bereft to discover what he, like the secretly autonomous adolescent she once was, doesn't dare admit to her: that, far from feeling stranded, he has moved on to forge a new connection. In her inspired concluding section\u2014three stand-alone stories, with separate titles, grouped together as \"Hema and Kaushik\"\u2014Lahiri again has younger Bengali-Americans unexpectedly pulled back into the old ways, only to find that the bonds they forge, unlike the ties their elders submitted to, don't rescue them. As she has before, Lahiri plays with an updated variation on an arranged marriage, intrigued by the notion that perhaps chance can steer us more happily than choice seems to. Kaushik and Hema, thrown together briefly as teenagers by their parents' tenuous friendship in suburban Boston, each narrate a story that prepares us for a much later, and brief, reunion. Their stories prepare subliminally for a rupture as well. Both unfold in the last, omnisciently narrated story. The trio is a tour de force, embodying in its structure and voices Lahiri's core themes. Outsiders at heart\u2014Kaushik has become a roving photojournalist, and Hema has only lately broken off a long-term affair with a married man\u2014the two characters reach back to probe a sense of homelessness, addressing their stories directly to each other. Here, at last, is a tie that feels foreordained, rooted in a shared past of family connection, reminiscent in that sense of their parents' arranged marriages. Yet Hema and Kaushik are restless American romantics, born in the wrong place and time to have the fatalistic courage of their elders, who trusted that a shared future would truly yoke them. As Lahiri steps in to thwart their convergence, she is as alert to \"all that is irrational as well as inevitable about the world\" as the father in The Namesake was. In her fiction, learning \"to not build walls around ourselves\" doesn't begin to cover the challenges that await her characters. They are wanderers navigating elusive borders, bumping up against barriers and testing ties, uneasily wondering if they will hold or not. That doesn't prevent Lahiri\u2014or Hema and Kaushik, or plenty of others in these impressive stories\u2014from finding \"kinship and beauty in unexpected places.\" But it inspires a perpetual vigilance and an awareness that, even as the globe shrinks, vast distances will never disappear. One of the very few things we know for sure about Shakespeare is that a stone slab lies over his grave site in the chancel of Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, inscribed with an epitaph: Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbear To dig the dust enclosed here. Blest be the man that spares these stones, And cursed be he that moves my bones. Did the greatest writer in the English language really take his leave with a rhyme that sounds like a 17th-century advertising jingle? And what made Shakespeare such a fierce protector of his own grave? One recent answer, perfectly plausible in the context of most Shakespeare studies, comes from Stephen Greenblatt, whose [Will in the World](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/105-1826403-8347606?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=will+in+the+world&x=12&y=17) (2004) is a beautifully assembled mosaic of Shakespeare's life, work, time, and place. Like many of the poet's biographers, Greenblatt is convinced that Shakespeare despised his wife. Hence the verse: He knew she would survive him and wanted to make sure she couldn't insist on being buried with him. And there the matter might have rested\u2014if Germaine Greer hadn't just galloped onto the field to defend the honor of the most reviled woman in the Shakespeare industry. Hated his wife? Says who? In her new book, [Shakespeare's Wife](http://www.amazon.com/Shakespeares-Wife-Germaine-Greer/dp/0061537152/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206043289&sr=8-1), Greer throws down her own explanations for the verse, reinforcing them with battalions of research. Various scraps of information about Shakespeare's final years, she argues, indicate he may have been dosed with mercury, which was the usual treatment for syphilis. Anyone digging up his bones\u2014to move them to the charnel house, as often happened when more room was needed in the chancel\u2014would have been able to tell by the lesions what had killed the poet. Not a pretty legacy. Perhaps his son-in-law, who was also his doctor, wrote the verse to protect the memory. Or, she suggests, maybe he was buried in the churchyard and the chancel shrine was set up later so that visitors coming to see Shakespeare's very own church would have something to sigh over. Greer notes that there was an attempt in the late 17th century to move Shakespeare's body to Westminster Abbey. If anyone had started digging and found no body in the chancel, the church would have been in big trouble. Maybe the verse was quickly inscribed on his gravestone to fend off such a possibility. Maybe ... probably ... it's likely ... perhaps ... Without such disclaimers, we'd have no Shakespeare industry at all. For centuries, scholars have trawled a tiny pool of reliable data about the poet's life, poring over each real-estate transaction or baptism as if it were a kind of homunculus that could tell us all we're longing to know about the man himself. The best of Shakespeare's biographers practice the art of speculation the way pianists sometimes let loose with glorious cadenzas of their own devising before returning to the score. Whole stretches of Greenblatt's book come across like Mozart\u2014pure pleasure, and there's no need to believe a word of it. But Greer isn't making music, she's defending a wronged woman; and if her book is less eloquent than Greenblatt's, it's also funnier and more provocative. She's obsessed with the other Shakespeare\u2014Ann (or Anne, or maybe Agnes) Hathaway (or Hathwey, possibly Gardner), who married William sometime around the end of November 1582. She was 26, he was 18. She was three months pregnant with the first of their three children. And that's pretty much all we know. Which is why Ann\u2014a woman with no back story\u2014is exactly the right subject for Greer, the Cambridge-educated feminist historian whose first book, The Female Eunuch (1970), declared that women's identities had been \"corrupted and extinguished\" by male needs and fantasies. \"Women must learn how to question the most basic assumptions of feminine normality,\" she wrote. \"Everything we may observe could be otherwise.\" It's a template for her approach to Ann Shakespeare: Don't let conventional scholarship get the last word. Similarly, in The Obstacle Race (1979), she resurrected five centuries' worth of forgotten female artists, not to claim they were geniuses but to figure out how and what they contributed to the history of art despite the stranglehold of propriety and custom. Hence she's always on the lookout for what must have been Ann's real-world accomplishments\u2014keeping her babies alive past the treacherous early years, for example\u2014while other scholars see nothing of interest in a woman who wasn't a high-born beauty or legendary courtesan. Greer herself is a longtime Shakespeare scholar with plenty of experience in the murky depths of Elizabethan-era research. By examining sources on Stratford, the Hathaway family, and the lives of comparable women, she comes up with a hazy but plausible CV featuring Ann's skills as a malt-maker, herbalist, knitter, and home manager. She also has a fine time slashing away at nearly everything previously written about Shakespeare's wife. Because of the supposedly shotgun marriage, biographers have asserted that young Shakespeare was seduced by an ugly old maid and dragged to the altar, and that he fled for London because the marriage made him miserable. Greer, by contrast, has young Shakespeare ardently wooing an older woman (several examples in the plays), welcoming the pregnancy because it meant their parents couldn't object to the marriage (if he didn't want to marry her, he could have run away or denied paternity), and leaving for London because he couldn't make a living in Stratford. The only evidence that he didn't keep loving her is that she gave birth to no more children (maybe she couldn't, after bearing twins) and the fact that there are no surviving love letters (but then, there are no surviving letters from Shakespeare to anyone). Greer also suggests that by the time Shakespeare packed and left, Ann may have been relieved. \"Ann Shakespeare could have been confident of her ability to support herself and her children, but not if she had also to deal with a layabout husband good for nothing but spinning verses, who had the right to do as he pleased with any money she could earn,\" she writes. \"Ten to one if he was useless, he was also restless.\" Yet the plays are full of wives who desperately miss their husbands, and Greer believes these portraits reflect Ann. Greer has always had a peculiar soft spot for rugged, time-worn marriages that can survive every storm. In The Female Eunuch, she offered the example of Lillian Hellman's long relationship with Dashiell Hammett. (This was before the discovery that Hellman had slathered her memoirs with fiction.) Over the years, wrote Greer, Hammett and Hellman fought, betrayed each other, parted, and returned\u2014a \"strange distant love affair\" more impressive to Greer than simple romance. Where Greenblatt finds a dearth of happy marriages in the plays, Greer finds more powerful bonds. \"What should be obvious is that Shakespeare did not think in twentieth-century cliches,\" she writes. \"We are not dealing her with representations of folk as 'happily married,' but as truly married.\" Greer never loses faith in this relationship, and she makes sure Ann doesn't, either. By the end of the book, Shakespeare's wife is selflessly nursing him through his final illness, financing the bust of the poet that was erected in the church, and helping organize the First Folio. It's a little much\u2014even Hellman didn't have to forgive syphilis\u2014but it speaks to a famous quirk at the heart of Greer's feminism. In The Female Eunuch, she praised The Taming of the Shrew for its portrait of Kate as an ideal wife. Huh? Kate, the free-spirited woman who is abused by her husband, Petruchio, until she's suitably broken? The whole play is odious, but Greer is drawn to it. Kate, she wrote, \"has the uncommon good fortune to find Petruchio, who is man enough to know what he wants and how to get it. He wants her spirit and her energy because he wants a wife worth keeping. ... [S]he rewards him with strong sexual love and fierce loyalty.\" In this book, Greer barely mentions the play; but I don't think she's changed her mind. I think she's taken this chance to give her beloved Shakespeare a wife who's worthy of him and the marriage he deserves. Romance [continues to blossom](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/us/politics/31clinton.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=scaife&st=nyt&oref=slogin) between Hillary Clinton and her once-mortal enemy, Richard Mellon \" [Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy](http://www.pfaw.org/pfaw/general/default.aspx?oid=10840)\" Scaife. In the March 31 issue of his crackpot newspaper, the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, which [loses somewhere between year](http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07259/817950-52.stm), Scaife [praises](http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/s_559659.html) Hillary's self-assurance, the depth of her knowledge on foreign and domestic issues, and her confidence. \"Her meeting and her remarks during it changed my mind about her,\" Scaife gushes\u2014affirming, perhaps, Woody Allen's famous maxim that 80 percent of success is showing up: Walking into our conference room, not knowing what to expect (or even, perhaps, expecting the worst), took courage and confidence. Not many politicians have political or personal courage today, so it was refreshing to see her exhibit both. Sen. Clinton also exhibited an impressive command of many of today's most pressing domestic and international issues. Her answers were thoughtful, well-stated, and often dead-on. [...] Does all this mean I'm ready to come out and recommend that our Democrat readers choose Sen. Clinton in Pennsylvania's April 22 primary? No\u2014not yet, anyway. In fairness, we at the Trib want to hear Sen. Barack Obama's answers to some of the same questions and to others before we make that decision. But it does mean that I have a very different impression of Hillary Clinton today than before last Tuesday's meeting\u2014and it's a very favorable one indeed. Scaife slobbered in similar fashion over Bill Clinton after the two enjoyed, last summer, what Scaife later [described to Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/02/scaife200802?currentPage=5) as a \"very pleasant\" that Scaife to $100,000 to Global Initiative](http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?pid=1399&srcid=-2)\u2014in the former president's New York office: \"I never met such a charismatic man in my whole life,\" Scaife says, glowing with pleasure at the memory. \"To show him that I wasn't a total Republican libertarian, I said that I had a friend named Jack Murtha,\" a Democratic member of the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. \"He said, 'Oh, Jack Murtha. You're talking about my golfing partner!' \" In the midst of these backslapping memories, though, Scaife goes carbuncle-eyed and refuses to answer on the record when asked if he still thinks Vince Foster's suicide was, as he once told the New York Times, \"the Rosetta Stone to the Clinton Administration.\" Scaife, as I [noted](http://www.slate.com/id/2187473/) last week, is a significantly more poisonous slinger of divisive rhetoric than Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's former minister, about whom Hillary expressed disapproval at the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review powwow. During the 1990s, Scaife professed to believe that Hillary had actually killed Foster, and he used the Tribune-Review to spread that ugly rumor. Scaife's unwillingness to retract such seamy accusations (\"[Bill Clinton] can order people done away with at his will. He's got the entire federal government behind him\") a full decade after the fact doesn't strike me as repentant, even by the redempt-o-matic standards of today's 24-hour news cycle. If, as Hillary said about Wright to Scaife and his employees, \"Hate speech [is] unacceptable in any setting,\" what are we to make of Scaife's regular outbursts of blatant misogyny? In 1981 he [called](http://backissues.cjrarchives.org/year/81/4/scaife_sidebars.asp) a female journalist profiling him for the Columbia Journalism Review a \"fucking Communist cunt,\" adding for good measure that her mother was \"ugly.\" Scaife's marriage broke up after a detective hired in 2005 by his wife, Margaret \"Ritchie\" Scaife, caught Scaife in flagrante with a woman who'd been [twice arrested for prostitution](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/02/scaife200802?currentPage=1). When Ritchie sought to confront the couple, Scaife had her arrested for trespassing. She [spent the night in jail](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/02/scaife200802?currentPage=1). Later, after Ritchie and Richard commenced marital separation, he [posted on his front lawn](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/02/scaife200802?currentPage=5) the sign \"WIFE AND DOG MISSING\u2014REWARD FOR DOG.\" For Hillary \"to seek help from Scaife in publicizing Obama's supposed tolerance of hate speech,\" Jonathan Alter [observes](http://www.newsweek.com/id/129587/page/2) in the April 7 Newsweek, \"sets a new standard in campaign chutzpah.\" In the [Feb. 26 presidential debate](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/26/us/politics/26text-debate.html?_r=1&bl=&ei=5087&en=0667d0ff53b714a8&ex=1204261200&oref=slogin&pagewanted=print) in Cleveland, Hillary told Obama that it wasn't enough for him to express strong disapproval of Louis Farrakhan's anti-Semitism; he had to reject Farrakhan's support. She cited a \"similar situation\" she'd faced during her first Senate run in 2000, when she \"rejected\" the support of the anti-Semitic Independence party. \"I was willing to take that stand,\" she said. And there's a difference between denouncing and rejecting. And I think when it comes to this sort of, you know, inflammatory\u2014I have no doubt that everything that Barack just said is absolutely sincere. But I just think we've got to be even stronger. We cannot let anyone in any way say these things because of the implications that they have, which can be so far reaching. Obama replied that he saw no difference \"between denouncing and rejecting,\" but that \"I'm happy to concede the point, and I would reject and denounce.\" Hillary's willingness to tolerate the potential support of a misogynist reptile like Scaife strikes me as precisely parallel. In this case, though, Clinton has not been asked to denounce or reject the prospect of a possible endorsement by Scaife and his Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. Why not? She could, I suppose, attempt a \"hate the sin, love the sinner\" approach and claim she's only mimicking [Obama's Wright speech](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9100.html). But Obama was able to point to longstanding personal ties; to the bitter life experience of Wright's generation of African-Americans; and to Wright's more laudable accomplishments, of which there were many. Hillary, by contrast, only just met Scaife for the first time; can cite no mitigating hardships in Scaife's life, save perhaps Scaife's well-publicized [alcoholism](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifemain050399.htm); and, except for that $100,000 check to her husband's foundation, can point to little in the way of laudable accomplishments. This last would be particularly awkward not only because of the impression it creates\u2014that the Clintons have been bought off\u2014but also because any discussion of Scaife's charitable giving would have to acknowledge its emphasis on funding conservative think tanks and nutty right-wing causes like the American Spectator's get-Clinton \" Louis Farrakhan, Hillary's Independence party for 2008. Does she dare tell Scaife that she doesn't want his damn endorsement, and that if he bestows it, she'll refuse it publicly? I wouldn't hold your breath. In the March 26 \" [Press Box](http://www.slate.com/id/2187499/),\" Jack Shafer mistakenly stated that a drug party described in a Time magazine story took place on Cape Cod.

General comments should be [posted](http://fray.slate.com/discuss/) in \"The Fray,\" our top=, resizable=no,status=yes,scrollbars=yes,'));) . . . . No matter how many \"courageous\" speeches Barack Obama gives, America will never be a \"Let's talk about race\" kind of place. It'll always be a \"Let's talk about how we can't talk about race\" kind of place. I'm all for doing my part. I'd like to start a talk show called This Week in Racism. Eventually, in the broadcast, we'd get around to the cover of Vogue's current \"shape\" issue. At the end of last week, a lot of people, smart and dumb, were losing their minds over it. The cover captures LeBron James dribbling a basketball while holding onto Gisele B\u00fcndchen. James, of course, is the NBA sensation, and B\u00fcndchen is the sensational Brazilian supermodel. His face is in mid-roar. His arm is around her waist. He appears to be 10 times her width. She looks underfed but appears to be having a very good time. And yet: \"It's racist,\" people cried. \"Racist how, you oversensitive weirdos?\" people cried back. James and B\u00fcndchen were playing themselves\u2014unless the image happened to remind you of a certain cinematic classic from 1933, in which a giant gorilla scoops up a pretty white lady and proceeds to mount the Empire State Building. This is where the trouble begins. According to this scenario, James is King Kong and B\u00fcndchen his Fay Wray. It's an easy conclusion to draw. James isn't wearing his Cavaliers uniform\u2014he's wearing anonymous black shorts and an anonymous black tank top. She's wearing a silky bias-cut gown, not unlike the one Wray wore. The photo, shot by Annie Leibovitz and surely signed off by Vogue Editor Anna Wintour, appeared, to some, to evoke one of the ugliest racist tropes: black male as ape. In the movie, Kong has a thing for Wray. But she's already sort of seeing someone, the dashing white adventurer who's trying to rescue her. The Vogue \"remake\" has intriguing symmetry. B\u00fcndchen is already seeing someone, too: the dashing quarterback Tom Brady, who is not simply white\u2014in the minds of many season-ticket holders and journalists alike, Brady is gilt. Vogue could have chosen Tyra Banks, Alek Wek, or even [Heidi Klum](http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20153804,00.html). But it went with a woman who, while ridiculously famous in her own right, is now recognizable as the girlfriend of American sports' golden boy. Somebody at that magazine knew what he or she was doing. The picture's visual inspiration might be King Kong, but the narrative corollary is D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation. Men, lock up your ladies! Here comes LeBron! But even typing that just gave me a headache. Only on a second glance, at a supermarket checkout, did any of the cover's subtexts surface for me. I was struck less by the stereotypes at play than by its erotic value: It's a hot image, and what's sexy about it is more a matter of celebrity than race. B\u00fcndchen doesn't look terrified. She looks exhilarated. And James looks neither mad nor simian: He looks triumphant. Vogue could have put one of the issue's more friendly, less suggestive [photos](http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/032508) on the cover. But they're comparatively dull. In the other shots of James and B\u00fcndchen, the two look like old girlfriends. The fun and sex that leap off the cover are gone. On the cover, the superstar and the supermodel have surprising chemistry, the kind that makes you stop pushing your shopping cart and pick up the magazine. It's possible that Tom Brady will get ribbed when he arrives at training camp this summer, but the ribbing seems just as likely to come from Randy Moss, who's black, as it would from Wes Welker, who's white. I'd like to think that after their groggy Super Bowl performance a few months ago, the Patriots have more pressing concerns. So do black people. I, for one, have racism fatigue. I'm wiped out. Between the outrage over Obama's Jeremiah Wright problems and Bill Clinton's unbelievable mutation from American's first black president into Karl Rove, I don't have the bandwidth to fight Anna Wintour. Seeing that cover as purely racist doesn't give the people looking at it enough credit. It dates Vogue for relying on the allusion but it also dates us for going crazy over it. Racial hysteria is the old black. Maybe it's so old it's avant-garde\u2014very Vogue.

Please send your questions for publication to [prudence@slate.com](mailto:prudence@slate.com). (Questions may be edited.) Dear Prudence, My older sister and I are very close and very much the opposite of each other. I am practical, organized, and always try to be a good role model. She is a free spirit, dressing in her teenager's clothes and just seeing how the cards fall. Her daughter is struggling, failing at school, and thinking of dropping out. She has been getting into fights at school and in trouble with the police. She also got pregnant but had a miscarriage. This girl is so smart and has such great potential but is making poor choices and crying out for attention. I would like to invite her to live with me, at least during the school year. My husband has agreed she is welcome to live with us and our daughter. I work during the day and am home every night and weekend. My sister works many evenings and weekends at a bar and is not home with her children often. She frequently goes out partying, and her drinking habits have many people in the family concerned. I am not trying to say that my sister is a bad mother or person. She is very loving and tries to give her children everything (material) that they want, which has also made them quite spoiled. Would it be wrong or offensive to invite my niece to live with me? \u2014Unsure Aunt Dear Unsure, You may not want to say your sister is a bad mother, so I will say it for you. What other conclusion can you draw about someone who is irresponsible, neglectful, indulgent, and drunk? Despite your closeness, you know your sister has made a hash of her own life and is doing everything she can to make sure the next generation does the same. It sounds as if it would be a blessing to bring your niece into your home and give her stability and firm, loving guidance so that she can graduate from school, instead of dropping out and giving birth to yet a third generation of misery. But if you do this, don't have any illusions about how hard it will be. Because of her lousy upbringing, your niece lacks control of her emotions and behavior; at the very least, you should seek assistance from people in the school system who can help give this girl the tools for successful functioning in life. You mention that while your sister is out partying, she leaves her children at home alone, which means there is more than one offspring at risk. Since your entire family is worried, all of you need to get together and get advice on working out a plan for interceding with your sister. Does she need rehab and parenting classes? Should social services be called in? Everyone needs to be less apprehensive about offending her sensibilities and more concerned about rescuing her children. \u2014Prudie Dear Prudence Video: He Won't Dress Up! Dear Prudie, I am a twentysomething female engaged to a wonderful man. We have been together for five years, and I couldn't be happier. During the summer, he was gone for months on business, and I committed a very bad act. After a night of what I thought was harmless flirting with a guy at a bar, he invited me to crash at his place. I made the biggest mistake of my life and cheated on my husband-to-be. I'm not blaming the incident on too much alcohol (although that was a contributor) and fully accept the blame for what I have done. I am full of guilt and hate for myself. I'm afraid to tell my fiance because I know our relationship will end, but at the same time, I don't want to start our lives together with a huge lie. My parents' marriage ended due to my father's infidelity, and I swore I wouldn't be like that ... but here I am. To make matters worse, my best friend is now dating this person. She knows what happened and was disgusted by it, but a month later they were exclusive. I know she is disappointed in me, but she doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that her boyfriend had a part in this, too. He has been sending me sexual text messages lately, and I know if she knew, she would blame me, although I've ignored the messages and have not welcomed this behavior. So, what do I do? Tell my amazing fiance what I did and hope he can find a way to forgive me, or keep my lips sealed? \u2014Once a Cheater, Not Always a Cheater Dear Once, Your best friend knows and disapproves of what you did, and is now dating the guy you cheated with; and the guy you cheated with is trying to betray your best friend so he can have another go round with you. This situation is about as stable as taking [Semtex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semtex) on a bumper-car ride. Chances are, your fiance eventually will hear about this\u2014and imagine the stress you'll be under hoping each day is not the day someone blabs. Yes, if you tell him, you run the risk of losing him, but at least you also have a chance to show you've come forward of your own accord, you are sickened by this single slip, and you pray he won't give up on you. It would be helpful if you could say you are so distressed by your own behavior\u2014especially since you grew up under the shadow of infidelity\u2014that you have already gone into therapy to figure out why it happened and make sure it never does again. \u2014Prudie Dear Prudence, I know parents shouldn't play favorites, but I can't seem to help myself. My two children have completely different temperaments: The boy, nearly 15, is sweet and considerate. He regularly tells me I'm \"the best mom in the world\" and is always generous with hugs. We almost never fight, but if reprimanded, he usually either apologizes or gets weepy. He is funny, interesting, and sweet, and I truly enjoy his company. His 13-year-old sister is a different story. Almost as soon as she learned to talk, she started telling me she hated me. She's nasty to her brother and demanding and rude to her father and me. She is constitutionally oppositional, arguing about everything from homework to whether she has to get out of bed in the morning. I know she's just a child, and I really do love her, but often I don't like her much. I know part of my job as a parent is helping her learn to handle her explosive personality, and I'm thankful that outside our house she is a mostly reasonable, pleasant girl. But I worry that\u2014if we survive five more years of this daily nastiness\u2014I will never want to see her again. That's not the kind of mother I want to be; I have two wonderful children, and I'd really like to feel equally connected to them. What can I do? \u2014Mommy Dearest Dear Mommy, You've got two issues: One is your guilt over preferring the company of your delightful son; the other is what to do about dealing with your very difficult daughter. I spoke to Dr. Alan Kazdin of Yale, author of The Kazdin Method for Parenting the Defiant Child, who says his approach will change the way your daughter treats you because it will show you how to change the way you respond to her. [His Web site](http://www.alankazdin.com/) has an introduction to his method of replacing your child's unwanted behavior by systematically rewarding the opposite behavior. This Washington Post [article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/21/AR2008032102806.html) has more from Kazdin, and other psychologists, on how to handle defiant kids. No method will turn your daughter from Groucho into Harpo, but some professional guidance should turn her into a Groucho who willingly gets out of bed in the morning. As for the imbalance in the way you react to your kids, Kazdin had some more advice: Lighten up on yourself. Who wouldn't favor the company of a happy, delightful person who says you're the best, to a hostile presence whose favorite phrase is \"I hate you\"? But if you can bring out your daughter's more agreeable qualities, you will feel less angst about your preference for your son. \u2014Prudie Dear Prudie, Recently, I have been put in an awkward situation with my group of friends. All are involved in different charitable organizations to which they ask me to donate. However, I do not agree with the goals of every organization (particularly those that are clearly religious in nature, as I'm agnostic bordering on apathetic) and would like to be generous with only those whose missions I support. But I'm pressured to give to all because each friend knows that I've given to certain charities and expects me to donate to theirs as well. I get guilt-tripped into giving and resent it, especially when I need the money myself. The situation became worse when my friend asked me to buy goods from her son to support the Boys Scouts of America, and I refused because I don't want to financially support an organization that is openly intolerant toward homosexuals. She said I was being selfish. How do I let my friends know that while I support their right to support, I don't want anything to do with their causes? \u2014Philanthropicky Dear Philanthropicky, Since your friends think you are Bill and Melinda Gates rolled into one, you have to take a firm stand with all of them. The causes that move you to get out your checkbook are your own business, so when your friends hit you up for the annual drive, explain that you are on a budget and you have already earmarked the organizations to which you are going to donate. From your Boy Scouts discussion, it sounds like you make the mistake of debating the merits of your friends' charitable ventures. Don't. Just say you know there are many worthy causes, and so you don't end up being a charity case yourself, you need to apply discipline to your giving. \u2014Prudie The mortar in Clinton machine's bulwark, once thought to be indestructible, continues to crumble as a once-faithful supporter hints that he might defect. Plus, more good fundraising news for the Obama camp brings Clinton to an even 9 percent chance of survival. On the face of it, New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine's [statement this morning on CNBC](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/04/03/854162.aspx) that he reserves the right to defect if Clinton loses the popular vote sounds more inside baseball than headline news. But consider these factors: Corzine [endorsed Clinton](http://blog.hillaryclinton.com/blog/main/2007/04/02/190800) more than a year ago as part of Clinton's initial sweep of superdelegates. (Yesterday was the anniversary of that announcement.) A defection by Corzine would mean the foundation is crumbling. Also, Clinton [won the New Jersey primary](http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21660914#NJ) by 11 points on Feb. 5. Jersey is in her backyard, and the fact that the governor would consider siding with the popular vote over the overwhelming opinion of his constituents won't go overlooked by other superdelegates from states she won. If Richardson is \"Judas,\" what would that make Corzine? Meanwhile, Obama announced $40 million in donations to his campaign in March, including more than 200,000 first-time contributors, [according to the press release](http://thepage.time.com/obama-release-on-march-fundraising-numbers/). The Clinton campaign was reticent on their own figures, which likely won't become public until the campaign files with the FEC down the road. Better for the Clinton campaign is how much traction its \"Obama can't win\" jingle is gaining. The words are emblazoned on the [cover of today's New up](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/04/03/854159.aspx) by MSNBC's First Read. Now that Obama's leads among pledged delegates and the popular vote appear to be insurmountable, look for the Clinton campaign to push this \"electability\" argument front and center. A [new poll](http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x2882.xml?ReleaseID=1164) from Quinnipiac University has Clinton ahead 50 percent to 41 percent in Pennsylvania, shaving a few degrees off the incline of Obama's uphill fight in the next-to-vote state. [Previous polls](http://www.pollster.com/08-PA-Dem-Pres-Primary.php) had put Clinton ahead by double digits in this must-win for her campaign. (A new [Public Policy Polling survey](http://politicalwire.com/archives/2008/04/02/ppp_poll_obama_takes_lead_in_pennsylvania.html) has Obama ahead by two points in AP, but this is [an outlier](http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/04/02/pa-poll-has-obama-ahead.aspx) for now.) How much this matters depends whose narrative you buy. The Clinton camp says \"a win is a win.\" The Obama camp, meanwhile, is tamping down expectations, despite outspending Clinton at least 3-to-1 in the state. CW-meister Mark Halperin [says](http://thepage.time.com/halperins-take-what-hillary-clinton-has-to-do-to-really-win-pennsylvania/) anything less than a 10-point win for Clinton in the Keystone State means it's over for her.

A high-profile Obama endorsement, a tightening race in Pennsylvania, and a big March fundraising gap dock Hillary 0.4 points, taking her down to 9.5 percent on the Clintometer. The big news: Democratic national-security guru and former Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton is [endorsing](http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080402/D8VPJL7O0.html) Barack Obama. Hamilton's backing isn't expected to invigorate voters, Kennedy-style (though you saw how that worked out). But as a member of the 9/11 commission and co-chair of the vaunted Iraq Study Group, he'll burnish Obama's foreign-policy credentials. (And maybe his old-folk cred, too\u2014Hamilton is 76.) Too bad he's not a superdelegate. However, Wyoming Gov. Dave Freudenthal, who also [endorsed Obama](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jvzT8keHzVS3YjP8BJDDrf64A_AwD8VPQV801) today, is. Hamilton's home state, meanwhile, doesn't agree with him. According to [a new SurveyUSA poll](http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=35417ff6-4985-47ce-8e1b-3fbe566d108d), Clinton leads Obama by nine points in Indiana. The state's May 6 primary is still a long way off, and this is just one poll, but a major Clinton victory there would hand the campaign a lifeline, even if Clinton still can't make up the pledged-delegate count. In Pennsylvania, Obama narrows the gap from 12 points to nine, according to a [Quinnipiac poll](http://blog.pennlive.com/pennsyltucky/2008/04/clintonobama_race_narrows_but.html) with a 2.5-point margin of error. A [Rasmussen poll](http://www.pollster.com/08-PA-Dem-Pres-Primary.php) puts the gap at five points. Again, there are still three weeks until April 22, but the chances of a Clinton blowout appear to be shrinking. At the same time, some Dem bigwigs are easing off earlier procedural recommendations that favored Obama. A day after Nancy Pelosi [said](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89260071) Clinton should stay in the race if she wants to, Howard Dean says [superdelegates should vote as independent agents](http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-superdelegates2apr02,1,7387579.story)\u2014not a revelation, but the statement backs away from suggestions that superdelegates should ratify the pledged-delegate count. That said, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid [agreed](http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/reid_endorses_july_1_ultimatum.php) with Dean that superdelegates need to make up their minds by July 1. For Clinton, time good, deadlines bad. Lastly: Less money, more problems. Early estimates put Obama's March fundraising total [north of $30 million](http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1727120,00.html). Not as hot as his $55 million February haul, but enough to dwarf Clinton's estimated $20 million for March. This despite what many consider Obama's worst news month yet. Meanwhile, Clinton's debts are reportedly as high as $9 million, not including her $5 million self-loan. Obama is already outspending her 3-to-1 in Pennsylvania\u2014and he can afford to continue. There's a saying that candidates never drop out; they just run out of cash. For a full list of our Deathwatches, [click here](http://www.slate.com/id/2162248/landing/1/).

Send your own prognostications to [hillarydeathwatch@gmail.com](mailto:hillarydeathwatch@gmail.com). When you've got a 1-in-10 shot of winning the Democratic nomination, a day without any major screw-ups is a good one. After avoiding any major pitfalls\u2014but also failing to lure Obama into any traps\u2014Clinton has buoyed her chances of winning the nomination to 9.9 percent. The good news first: [Yesterday we relayed](http://www.slate.com/id/2187793/) that the Wall Street Journal was reporting that Obama was going to snag seven North Carolina superdelegates in the coming days. It turns out somebody jumped the gun. [He'll get endorsements](http://projects.newsobserver.com/under_the_dome/butterfield_more_endorsements_coming), but we don't know how many. Meanwhile, in Mississippi, Obama [picked up two unexpected delegates](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0408/Delegate_pickups.html), which tightens the vise on Clinton yet again. Also, Clinton crawled back to within four points of Obama in today's [national Gallup poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/105952/Gallup-Daily-Obama-49-Clinton-45-Latest-Update.aspx). Even better news: [Enterprising poll watchdogs](http://www.pollster.com/blogs/day_of_week_effect_in_gallup_d.php) discovered that Obama's Gallup numbers are routinely better when the polling window includes the weekend rather than only the workweek. Clinton and her pollster, Mark Penn, now have license to toss grains of salt all over Obama's resurgence in the polls. ( [Late-breaking developments](http://www.pollster.com/blogs/re_2_dayofweek_effect_in_gallu.php) may put an end to the salt-sprinkling, though.) Nancy Pelosi offered a little more sunshine in Hillaryland when [she told NPR's Morning Edition](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89260071) that Clinton should take the nomination fight to the convention if she feels like it. For Obama Democrats, that's like telling Clinton to take a knife and start stabbing the party's heart while she's at it. But all good things must come to an end. Word leaked that Obama is outspending [Clinton 3-to-1](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/nation_world/20080401_Obama_knocks_McCain__says_primary_fight_not_hurting.html) in Pennsylvania, a problem for Clinton's campaign, which is already beset by rumors of financial trouble. Advertising usually leads to a surge in the polls, and Obama already trails Clinton [by a moderate 11 points](http://www.pollster.com/08-PA-Dem-Pres-Primary.php) in the Keystone State. If she can't counteract Obama's advertising arsenal, she'll fall back to free media like [her appearance on Leno](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/03/31/845479.aspx) on Thursday to charm her way into America's living rooms. Worst of all, Canada has once again been injected into the Democrats' nomination fight. In [an interview with Canadian public radio](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0408/Cleavers_bluntness.html) on Sunday, Missouri Rep. and Clinton superdelegate Emanuel Cleaver said he'd be \"stunned if [Barack Obama] is not the next president of the United States.\" Cleaver, who is black, said the African-American community would like it if he backed Obama, but he wouldn't feel right if he made the switch. He compared her to a football team that you know isn't going to win, but you root for it anyway. That'll inspire confidence. And finally, from the Department of Bad Omens, Clinton [announced a foolish new theme song](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/yo-adrian-clinton-has-a-new-theme-song/). It's the [famous score](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMm99pHMR5Y) from Rocky. Only problem: Rocky loses to Apollo Creed at the end of the first film. For a full list of our Deathwatches, [click here](http://www.slate.com/id/2162248/landing/1/). For a primer on [our first Deathwatch entry](http://www.slate.com/id/2187558/). UPDATE: Clinton's chances of winning have already gone up 0.2 percent since we wrote this. [Click here](http://www.slate.com/id/2187886/) for the latest Deathwatch odds. Lots of Clinton news over the weekend, not all bad\u2014but bad enough to dock her another 0.6 points in the Rodhameter, bringing her chances of winning to 9.7 percent. Roughest of all is the latest national Gallup poll, which [gives](http://www.gallup.com/poll/105841/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Now-52-Clintons-42.aspx) Obama a margin-of-error-busting lead of 10 points\u2014his largest this year. Rather than destroying him, maybe the Jeremiah Wright flap only made him stronger (in the short term, at least). That, or [Bosnia is the new macaca](http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0308/Cashstrapped_Clinton_fails_to_pay_bills.html). But Clinton soldiers on. She [vowed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/29/AR2008032901909.html?nav=rss_politics) to the Washington Post on Saturday that she would continue to the convention in August. We would take her word for it, if promising to push on weren't a [frequent predictor of doing just the opposite](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/3/30/162324/643/888/487282). Meanwhile, Obama [ratcheted down](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/30/AR2008033000209.html) the \"Hillary must go\" rhetoric, saying she can stay in the race as long as she wants. Smart move to soften the drop-out drumbeat, even if he himself never called for her to exit. Too much cockiness could stoke a backlash. Clinton still [leads](http://www.politico.com/superdelegates/) among superdelegates, 250 to 217, but Obama continues to close the gap. Today, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar [endorses](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/03/31/klobuchar_endorses_obama.html) Obama\u2014the 64th superdelegate to swing his way since Feb. 5. (Clinton has [lost at least eight](http://abcnews.go.com/WN/Vote2008/story?id=4454683) in that same period.) Everyone saw it coming, but a nail is still a nail. Make that another prominent white woman (on top of Claire McCaskill, Janet Napolitano, and Kathleen Sebelius) who doesn't think Hillary should be the nominee. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal [reports](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120692054573175525.html?mod=hps_us_whats_newshttp://online.wsj.com/article/SB120692054573175525.html?mod=hps_us_whats_news) that Obama has seven North Carolina superdelegates lined up to endorse. Things look equally dire on the financial front, as the Clinton campaign [struggles to pay its bills](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9259.html) in a timely fashion. As the Politico's Ken Vogel reported over the weekend, \"If she had paid off the $8.7 million in unpaid bills she reported as debt and had not loaned her campaign $5 million, she would have been nearly $3 million in the red at the end of February.\" That the unpaid bills [include health insurance costs](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9274.html) doesn't help. But, hey, at least Clinton can make the case that she won big states like Texas, right? Sadly, no. Final numbers are still trickling in from the district and county conventions Texas held on Saturday (Step 2 in the state's electoral freak show), but it looks like Obama [won the day](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iNxTApa2sQRu0Xx99P3jt2bEXw7gD8VO92LO0)\u2014and, by extension, the state's March 4 vote. Clinton netted five delegates in the primary, but Obama's estimated nine-delegate net in the caucus puts him ahead of her. Clinton will continue to say she won Texas, but if you're talking about delegates, she didn't. Meanwhile, violence in Iraq intensified\u2014then [cooled](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/31/AR2008033100644.html?hpid=topnews)\u2014as the Maliki government cracked down on Shiite militias in Basra and Baghdad. For Hillary, the Iraq imbroglio is double-edged. On the one hand, Clinton loves her a national-security debate. But on the other, it steers discussion back to that pesky 2003 authorization vote. Last time we checked, Clinton was [nudging the convo](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2008/03/06/operation-afghanistan.aspx) away from Iraq and toward Afghanistan, the invasion everyone can agree on. So, with a dip in the polls, another superdelegate lost, mounting debt, and ugly numbers in Texas, the outlook in Hillaryland remains bleak. On Saturday, Clinton compared the race to a basketball game: \"You know, we are in the fourth quarter and it is a close contest. We are running up and down. We are taking shots.\" The metaphor would work if she mentioned that Obama [is up by 124 points](http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/primaries/), he has the ball, and Clinton has been missing shots all quarter. All she has now is hustle. For a primer on Hillary's sinking ship, visit [our first Deathwatch entry](http://www.slate.com/id/2187558/). Friday was not kind to Hillary Clinton. Based on Deathwatch's top-secret morbidity formula, Hillary tanked on four metrics today, reducing her chances of winning the nomination by 1.7 points to 10.3 percent. The nastiest news for Clinton is in the polls. She has drifted eight points behind Obama in a national [Gallup survey](http://www.gallup.com/poll/105814/Gallup-Daily-Obama-Back-Into-Lead-Democratic-Race.aspx)\u2014the first time that she has trailed Obama by a statistically significant margin since the Rev. Wright imbroglio. Every point she loses in the national polls pushes her a bit closer to Davy Jones' locker. In Pennsylvania, she suffered a setback in her efforts to win endorsements and superdelegates when Sen. Bob Casey [endorsed Obama](http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/the-casey-endorsement/) even though he said he was staying neutral in the race. Casey comes from a [long political lineage](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2008/03/28/family-man.aspx) that is well-known in the eastern part of the state and among Catholic Pennsylvanians. Rubbing salt in the wound, Obama said he didn't even court Casey's support\u2014he entered the House of Obama on his own volition. Meanwhile, Sen. Patrick Leahy\u2014an Obama supporter\u2014 [called for Clinton's withdrawal](http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/03/28/america/Clinton-Leahy.php) yesterday but then removed his foot from his mouth and [backed off the assertion](http://thepage.time.com/statement-from-vermont-sen-leahy/) today, saying it's a decision \"that only she can make.\" Even though he dialed back his original statement, it adds another high-profile voice to the growing din that Clinton is doing more harm than good by sticking around. Chris Dodd\u2014another Obama devotee\u2014has [made similar comments](http://nationaljournal.com/onair/transcripts/080327_dodd_chris.htm). Two statements from two head honchos are also draining Clinton's momentum. Both [Howard Dean](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2008/03/28/dean-can-talk-after-all.aspx) and [Al Gore](http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/mar/28/gore-thinks-dem-nomination-will-be-set-before/) said they expected the nomination to be decided before the convention. Pressure from the top will likely push superdelegates to side with Obama or Clinton before August. Hillary's political clock is ticking. For a primer on Hillary's sinking ship, visit [our first Deathwatch entry](http://www.slate.com/id/2187558/). In December, six British men were given multiyear prison sentences for hijacking a French delivery truck and stealing $168,000 worth of Courvoisier cognac. To anyone familiar with the recent ups and downs of the cognac market, it is a tale with symbolic resonance. In the late 1990s, you almost couldn't give France's most famous brandy away; these days, cognac sales are at record levels, producers are struggling to keep up with demand, and highway robberies are cutting into the available supply. So how did cognac get its groove back? Credit its revival to an unlikely union of American rap stars, Chinese and Russian fat cats, and hipster bartenders. That cognac ever fell on hard times was a mighty comedown for the so-called king of brandies. Cognac is prized for its complex perfume, its refined flavor, and its staying power on the palate. Some find it a little too regal. A.J. Liebling preferred Calvados, the apple-based spirit from Normandy, which he claimed had \"a more agreeable bouquet, a warmer touch to the heart, and a more outgoing personality than Cognac.\" Apart from a few dissenting opinions, however, cognac has always been considered the classiest and most pleasurable brandy. As it happens, my lone visit to the Cognac region, located on the Atlantic coast just north of Bordeaux, was in 1999, when the crisis was at its peak. It was just a few weeks before the turn of the millennium, and the mood in Cognac, even among the big four producers\u2014Courvoisier, Hennessy, Martell, and R\u00e9my Martin\u2014was apocalyptic. Japan's prolonged economic malaise and the financial meltdown that struck the rest of East Asia in 1997 had hit cognac hard, and the single-malt scotch mania then sweeping Western yuppiedom had come as another heavy blow. Sales were stagnant, local grape growers were staging violent protests, and cognac was burdened with the worst possible image\u2014it was seen as an old fart's drink, a digestif for tuxedoed geezers smoking cigars in wood-paneled libraries. The future for Cognac seemed as dark as its cellars, and even if I hadn't been a fan of the region's signature tipple, the gloom I encountered there would have driven me to drink. Amid all the despair, however, the makings of a resurrection were already sliding into place. Cognac had always enjoyed a strong following among African-Americans, and during the 1990s, it became a staple of rap lyrics. References to yak and nyak began turning up in hip-hop songs, a trend that reached its apogee with the 2001 Busta Rhymes/P. Diddy duet \"Pass the Courvoisier.\" (\"Give me the Henny/ You can give me the Cris/ You can pass me the R\u00e9my/ But pass the Courvoisier.\") Although a spokesman for Busta later admitted to the New York Times that the performer had used Courvoisier simply because it fit in the song and was actually a Hennessy man, the hit anthem gave Courvoisier a huge boost in sales, and the shout-out from the rap community sent cognac's cachet soaring, a development that was the subject of bemused coverage in the business press. It's believed that the African-American community now accounts for anywhere from 60 percent to 80 percent of U.S. sales. According to Impact Databank, 4 million cases of cognac were sold in the United States last year, more than double the number a decade ago. Another bump has come from the cocktail renaissance that began in the 1990s. The \"mixology\" fad, with its bar chefs, cocktail stylists, and outr\u00e9 concoctions, has been a tonic for almost the entire spirits sector, and the cognac industry is no exception. In fact, some credit the Hennessy martini, which became popular in the mid-1990s, with jump-starting the cocktail revival. Cognac has been used for cocktails as far back as the 19th century. One of the all-time classic mixed drinks, the sidecar, supposedly invented in Paris during World War I, is composed of cognac, Cointreau, and lemon juice; it is now coming back into fashion, and the mixology phenomenon has also given rise to some new cognac-based drinks. The cognac region recently played host to an International Cognac Summit, during which a group of eminent mixologists invented a drink called \"the summit,\" composed of cognac, lemonade, lime zest, cucumber peel, and fresh ginger. The third leg in cognac's rebuilt stool is the growing affluence of China and Russia. While the United States is still cognac's largest export market, taking roughly one of every three bottles shipped abroad, demand in both China and Russia is surging. With cognac imports growing 20 percent to 30 percent annually, China has now eclipsed Britain as cognac's second-biggest overseas market. Business is flourishing in Russia, too, and not just for the big-four exporters. Some smaller producers, notably Delamain and Audry, also command strong followings there. So great is the Russian thirst for cognac that they are even invading the vineyards: Last year, an outfit called the Russian Wine Trust acquired Croizet, a cognac house founded in 1805. All three factors in combination have created a global cognac frenzy. In 2007, a record 158 million bottles were sold worldwide, and the cognac houses are naturally rushing to cash in on the flush times, particularly at the high end. Hennessy recently introduced a new cognac, called Beaut\u00e9 du Si\u00e8cle, whose specs are as over-the-top as its name: Only 100 bottles are being produced, the bottles are all made of Baccarat crystal, each one comes in an ornate mirrored chest apparently fashioned by a team of 10 artists, and the cognac is hand-delivered to buyers by members of the Hennessy board. The cost? $235,000 per bottle. Most cognacs don't require six-figure investments, but given all the branding, marketing, and elaborate packaging, cognac is not cheap, and the combination of spiraling global demand and a sickly U.S. dollar is only ratcheting up the cost. VSes, the lowest-rung cognacs (ranked thus because they are the least aged), typically go for between $25 and $35, while VSOPs, one level up, fetch $35 to $50 per bottle. XOs, the premium offerings, normally sell for $70 and up. The tariffs are stiff, though it is worth bearing in mind that an open bottle of cognac can be consumed over a number of months. So which cognacs are worth drinking, and how should you drink them? VSes and VSOPs are generally considered cocktail material, while XOs are usually left unadulterated. (Click [here](#2188127) for more information on the differences among VS, VSOP, and XO.) Purists\u2014curmudgeons, if you prefer\u2014find the whole cognac-as-cocktail thing a bit louche. Not being the shaken-and-stirred type myself, I definitely prefer cognac straight up. On the other hand, less-aged cognacs, even most VSOPs, are not much fun on their own (the flavors are often harsh and unharmonious) and work better in combination with other spirits, soda, or tonic. Moreover, VSes and VSOPs account for 85 percent of all the cognac on the market, and if the mixology phenomenon is helping support production at all levels\u2014and clearly it is\u2014then I say mix away. As for specific cognac producers, my taste runs to the little guys. The big four, which soak up more than 90 percent of cognac sales in the United States, turn out very good XOs, but I find that the brandies made by some of the smaller houses are more distinctive. I also prefer them because they tend to show more fruit and flowers, less heat and wood. Delamain Pale & Dry XO ($120) is a personal favorite \u2014a mellow cognac, with terrific aromas of dried fruits, flowers, licorice, vanilla, and spice, leading to an eternal finish. I also love the Audry R\u00e9serve Sp\u00e9ciale ($115), a buttery-smooth elixir with a bouquet of honey, nuts, baking spices, flowers, and minerals. (If you've got the dosh, Delamain and Audry both produce higher-end that are more ethereal.) is another insider's choice. The Hine Antique XO ($145) is an elegant brandy marked by orange peel, wood, floral, and spice flavors that show great persistence. Hine also produces an excellent VSOP that, rare for this category, drinks well straight up. Fittingly, it is called Hine Rare VSOP ($50). It doesn't have the complexity of the Antique, but it has good fruit and floral scents along with an appealing nutty note, and it goes down very nicely. I am also a fan of Frapin. Frapin's Chateau Fontpinot of wood, earth, and menthol. Having any of these cognacs after a good meal is almost enough to make me want to throw on my tux, grab a cigar, and join those geezers in the library. Return to [article](#back2188127) Over the centuries, various grapes have been used for cognac; the principal one these days is ugni blanc, an otherwise-pedestrian variety that just happens to make for great brandy. The grapes are grown in six different districts that ring the town of Cognac in a series of concentric circles. In descending order of prestige, they are Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne (the two Champagnes have nothing to do with the sparkling wine, but, like the Champagne region, they are known for their chalky-soil influences), Borderies, Fins term \"Fine Champagne,\" which appears on some labels, means that the cognac was made from a blend of eaux de vie produced in the two Champagne districts; to be designated as such, however, it must contain more than 50 percent Grande Champagne grapes.) Cognac is made through a double distillation of the base wine, which yields an eau de vie that is around 70 percent alcohol. Years of maturation in oak casks evaporates much of the alcohol (the evaporated content is poetically referred to as \"the angels' share\"). Depending on how much natural evaporation takes place, distilled water or low-alcohol spirits may be added to take the alcohol level of the finished brandy down to 40 percent, which is the norm, and the minimum required. Cognacs are categorized according to the amount of aging they have received. VS, or \"very special,\" contains eaux de vie that have spent at least two years in barrels. VSOP, or \"very superior old pale,\" requires a minimum of four years' aging. XO, or \"extra old,\" requires a minimum of six years, although the eaux de vie used for the better XOs tend to be much older. [Dismissed]() by reviewers and ignored by audiences in 1997, Lost Highway has come to occupy an increasingly central place in David Lynch's evolution. This malevolent neo-noir was a return to first principles\u2014not since his hallucinatory debut, Eraserhead (1977), had a Lynch film so completely taken up residence inside someone's head\u2014but it was also a sign of things to come. Except for the G-rated detour of The Straight Story (1999), [*](#a) his subsequent films\u2014the sumptuous Hollywood nightmare Mulholland Drive (2001) and its degraded video corollary Inland Empire (2006)\u2014have assumed the form devised in Lost Highway. All three, which could be said to make up a psychosis trilogy, are nonlinear puzzle-movies in which the otherworldly ambience and the rifts in space-time are a direct outgrowth of the protagonist's mental trauma. Simply put\u2014simple being a relative concept here\u2014Lost Highway is the story of a jazz musician (Bill Pullman) who apparently kills his possibly unfaithful wife (Patricia Arquette), then turns into someone else (Balthazar Getty) who promptly begins an affair with the dead woman's doppelg\u00e4nger (Arquette again), or maybe it's the same woman, not actually dead and wearing a blond wig. The film has taken ages to make its way to [DVD](http://www.amazon.com/Lost-Highway-Bill-Pullman/dp/B001152TL6/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1206840336&sr=8-1), and in a rudely perfunctory edition at that\u2014not a single extra, unless you count subtitles. (The [British](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Highway-Bill-Pullman/dp/B000A16I8M/ref=pd_bbs_sr_3?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1206837428&sr=8-3) and [French](http://www.amazon.fr/Lost-Highway-Ultimate-\u00c3dition-DVD/dp/B000B6GFHK/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1206837494&sr=8-1) releases, featuring interviews with Lynch and the actors, are superior options if you have a multiregion player.) Still, Lost Highway has attracted a growing cult. Critics complained about its incoherence, but today the film seems easier to parse than, say, Inland Empire or even cult brainteasers like Memento, Donnie Darko, and [Primer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384/). With its myriad doublings and insistent twinning of the sex and death drives, it has been a goldmine for psychoanalytically inclined scholars (including philosopher Slavoj iek), who have deciphered the plot in terms of repressed memory, wish fulfillment, and [repetition compulsion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_compulsion). Despite his famous aversion to interpretations, Lynch has encouraged these psychological readings by describing the hero's condition as a \"psychogenic fugue\" (a disorder whose main feature, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, is \"sudden, unexpected travel away from home ... with inability to recall one's past\"). It's not just shrinks and academics who have been inspired. David Foster Wallace's essay in Premiere magazine on the making of the film is a masterful blend of set-visit reporting and critical biography. One of the movie's eeriest plot points\u2014a couple terrorized by surveillance videotapes\u2014later turned up in Michael Haneke's Cach\u00e9. Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth, making an explicit link between a psychological and a musical fugue, reimagined Lost Highway as an avant-garde opera, with a libretto by novelist and Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek. \"When I saw the film for the first time,\" Jelinek said, \"it was like a blow to my brain stem.\" Those who love or loathe Lost Highway, which Lynch co-wrote with novelist Barry Gifford, probably do so for much the same reason: It's visceral to the point of discomfort. The first third\u2014practically wordless, confined to interiors, scored to an especially bass-heavy version of Lynch's signature drone\u2014is a sustained creepfest that belongs with [the retreat](http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZMiXphbCR04&feature=related) into the [Black Lodge](http://youtube.com/watch?v=7qbUrLth55Q&feature=related) the or [the Club Silencio interlude](http://youtube.com/watch?v=ApMyMGRa7x4) in Mulholland Drive. Fred and Renee (Pullman and Arquette) live in a big, bare Modernist box and in a constant state of nameless dread. Their conversations are stilted and ominous, and so is the sex. Rooms are balefully underlit; labyrinthine corridors lead into pitch darkness. (Lynch bought the building, in the Hollywood Hills, especially for the film, and it now houses his production facility; he lives next door.) The paranoid mood intensifies with the mysterious appearance of VHS cassettes on Fred and Renee's doorstep: Apparently someone is taping them as they sleep. The use of video here foreshadows Lynch's conversion to digital. After shooting Inland Empire on consumer-grade video, he vowed never to go back to celluloid. Even in Lost Highway, beautifully shot on film by Peter Deming, it's clear that to Lynch, video communicates a different kind of truth. The tapes are not mere stalker artifacts; they signal the return of the repressed. When a detective asks whether the couple owns a camcorder, Fred says he hates them, and his explanation is telling: \"I like to remember things my own way ... not necessarily how they happened.\" The discovery of Renee's dead body, not incidentally, happens on video. Lynch later revealed that the film's basic drives\u2014murderous jealousy and repressed guilt\u2014emerged from an obsession with the O.J. Simpson case. Interviewed on the French DVD, he says, \"Here's a guy who\u2014at least I believe, you know\u2014committed two murders and yet is able to go on living and speaking and, you know, doing and golfing. ... How does the mind protect itself from that knowledge and go on?\" The O.J. connection makes the presence of Robert Blake in a pivotal role all the more unnerving. (Blake was later tried and acquitted for the murder of his wife.) The first act reaches its sinister peak with the appearance of Blake's kabuki-faced ghoul. Accosting Fred at a party, the Mystery Man, as he's identified in the credits, claims he's at Fred's house at that very moment and proves it with one of the freakiest phone calls in film history. The scene is a textbook illustration of that uncanny sensation so specific to Lynch films that they are often simply called Lynchian (per David Foster Wallace, \"one of those Potter Stewart-type words that's definable only ostensively\u2014i.e., we know it when we see it\"). At their creepiest, Lynchian moments involve a shock of recognition (or self-recognition) and a metaphysical impossibility: d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, seeing a doppelg\u00e4nger, being in two places at once. When the heroines of Mulholland Drive are huddled in Club Silencio, the onstage cabaret is revealed as a sham (the singer collapses but the song goes on), forcing Naomi Watts to confront the failure of her own fantasy. In Inland Empire, Laura Dern finds that she has somehow wandered back to an earlier point in the film and is spying on ... herself. In the trance state that often takes over in Lynch's films, these moments are the equivalent of a hypnotist's clap. Sometimes these rupture points, when illusions fall apart or the action shifts from one reality to another, are cued by code words or phrases that recur throughout, gaining mystical significance with each repetition: \"This is the girl\" from Mulholland Drive; \"I'm not who you think I am\" from Inland Empire. Lost Highway has its own magic phrase. In the [first scene](http://youtube.com/watch?v=cWJOJFob0bE), the intercom buzzes at Fred and Renee's house, and a voice declares, \"Dick Laurant is dead.\" When Fred looks out the window, there's no one there. (Lynch says this happened to him one day, an unknown voice intoning those very words.) At the end of the film, the same intercom buzzes and the same phrase is spoken, but this time Fred is the speaker, not the listener. The narrative resolves into a [M\u00f6bius strip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobius_strip), ending where it begins (albeit from a jarringly different perspective). The lost highway that races by in the David Bowie-scored [opening credits](http://youtube.com/watch?v=OtpHR3d0O-Y) is not quite a road to nowhere but, perhaps more alarming, an infinite loop. The relation between circular form and obsessive content attests to the vortexlike pull of Hitchcock's Vertigo, a sacred text for Lynch (who also explored the blond-brunette dichotomy in Twin Peaks and Mulholland Drive). iek argues that the narrative's shape mirrors \"the very loop of the psychoanalytic treatment in which, after a long detour, we return to our starting point.\" Lynch made Lost Highway after a five-year silence (his previous feature, the widely panned Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me, had depleted his cachet), and it appears to have unlocked something in him. The movie is itself a rupture point within the Lynch cosmos. It moved his films even closer to the logic of the unconscious, not least his own. In the French DVD interview, he acknowledged as much. The protagonist's flight from reality \"has a beautiful feel to it,\" he says. \"I get the psychogenic fugue almost every afternoon.\" [*]()Correction, April 1, 2008: This story mistakenly stated that David Lynch's The Straight Story was rated PG. ( [Return](#b) to the corrected sentence.) The last time PPP polled Pennsylvania, Barack Obama was down by 26 points. That was two and a half weeks ago, after the Rev. Wright controversy but before Obama's speech about race in America. PPP did another sweep through the state this week and found drastically different results. According to PPP ( [Pollster.com's polling average](http://www.pollster.com/08-PA-Dem-Pres-Primary.php) shows Obama trailing Clinton by 10 points in the state\u2014far from PPP's numbers. No other poll has ever shown Obama in the lead in the state. Obama's lead comes from a shift in support from demographics across the board. His numbers with men, women, African-Americans, baby boomers, and seniors are all up. He's made double-digit increases among voters who care most about health care, the economy, and the war in Iraq. But again, these are numbers we haven't seen anywhere else before. Two other polls taken during a similar time span\u2014but using different methodologies\u2014both had Obama trailing Clinton.

Posted by Chadwick Matlin, April 3, 1:32 won candidate: Delegates won by each candidate: Source: CNN . . The month of April kicked off with severe storms soaking [much](http://www.usatoday.com/weather/storms/2008-03-31-oklahoma-storms_N.htm) [of](http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2008/04/severe_weather_possible_today_1.html) the [country](http://www.accuweather.com/news-top-headline.asp?partner=accuweather&traveler=0&date=2008-04-01_08:07&month=4&year=2008). The old adage would have us believe that all this rain bodes well for next month's blossoms. But do April showers really bring May flowers? No more so than showers in May or September. Exactly which rainy period has the biggest effect on growth depends on whether you're looking at perennials or annuals. Perennials, which are plants whose roots stay alive even after the part aboveground dies, usually pop up as the first proud trumpeters of spring. If you're in Maine or England, that's likely to be in May; farther south, it makes more sense to call them late-March and early-April flowers. (Some perennials like the [Cyclamen coum](http://www.palantir.co.uk/oldgarden/garpic/203i.JPEG) have the audacity to show up and thrive as early as January.) Regardless of when the perennials bloom, the rainfall of the previous month isn't that relevant. Plants such as tulips and daffodils, two common perennials, sprout from bulbs that have been in the ground since at least the previous autumn, which is when their buds were forming and roots were growing. So if there had been a severe drought in September, the tulips and daffodils may suffer months later. Once the foliage starts peeking through the soil in early spring, rainfall again becomes important. If there's a drought, the perennials won't grow as high, and they wither faster. But in most years, there's enough moisture in the soil from the winter's snow to sustain the spring flowers. Whatever effect April's showers do have on May flowers tends to be negative. Too much rain while the plants are blossoming makes them more susceptible to diseases like [Botrytis blight](http://www.umass.edu/umext/floriculture/fact_sheets/pest_management/botrytis.html), which causes [buds to shrivel](http://plantclinic.cornell.edu/Factsheets/botrytis/botrytis_rose_big.htm) before they open. For annuals, which are the flowers that must be replanted every year, lifespan and growth are influenced by the rainfall in the months immediately after they're planted, not the month before. Summer annuals like petunias, marigolds, geraniums, tomatoes, and cucumbers go into the ground after the [frost-free date](http://www.naturalgardening.com/shop/frostdatesa-n.php3), which varies by region but hovers around late April. Once planted, they must receive enough water during the next few months to stay healthy. (The exact amount depends on heat and wind, but a good rule of thumb is that if you stick a finger into the soil and feel some moisture, you're good.) Too much heavy rain can beat them down or, if the soil isn't draining properly, drown their roots and kill them. But April showers would have no effect on annuals planted in May. The one place where April showers would truly bring May flowers is the desert. In arid regions like the Mojave, plants sit under the sand, sometimes for years, just waiting for enough water to send up shoots and leaves. A few weeks\u2014or sometimes even days\u2014after a heavy rainfall, the desert will explode with [color](http://homepage.mac.com/parody/cereus_blog/P3301342_mod_5.5.jpg).

The New York Times reports that two men in Hawaii have [filed a lawsuit](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/science/29collider.html?_r=1&oref=slogin) in federal court to stop the construction of a [particle accelerator near Geneva](http://lhc.web.cern.ch/lhc/). The plaintiffs claim that the facility on the French-Swiss border\u2014which is partially funded by the U.S. government\u2014might create bizarre physical conditions that would lead to the creation of a black hole capable of swallowing the planet. The case is set for an initial conference with the Justice Department in mid-June. Could the government be legally responsible for risking the apocalypse? No. For cases like the [one](http://www.lhcconcerns.com/LHCConcerns/Forums/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=29) filed last month against the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, the plaintiffs face several virtually insurmountable barriers in U.S. courts. As part of the demonstration of [standing](http://www.law.cornell.edu/anncon/html/art3frag17_user.html), they must prove damages or the threat of damages, known as \"injury-in-fact.\" In this case, they must demonstrate that the threat posed by the LHC is genuine and significant. When one of the same plaintiffs filed a similar case against the [Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider](http://www.bnl.gov/world/) in 1999, a California court ruled that his claims were \"speculative\" and that he failed to prove any imminent risk. There is no hard and fast rule for how probable a risk must be in order to qualify as injury-in-fact. In 2006, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals [ruled](http://pacer.cadc.uscourts.gov/docs/common/opinions/200608/04-1438b.pdf) (PDF) that that the Natural Resources Defense Council had standing to sue the EPA over ozone depletion on the basis of a risk of nonfatal skin cancer in one out of 200,000 people. However, even physicists who have been charitable to the concerns over the particle accelerator overwhelmingly say the probability of a disaster is many orders of magnitude smaller than that. Even if the plaintiffs could gain standing in their case\u2014a matter that would also involve questions of when individuals have standing on environmental threats\u2014they would have to demonstrate that those overseeing the collider had broken the law in some way. The current lawsuit charges that the defendants, including the U.S. Department of Energy, violated the [National Environmental Policy Act](http://www.epa.gov/oecaerth/nepa/index.html) by failing to adequately notify the public of safety concerns. The lawsuit also argues that the defendants ignored the \"precautionary principle,\" an approach to weighing the promises and risks of research. A [definition](http://www.sehn.org/wing.html) of the principle drafted by a 1998 consortium stated, in part, that when a line of research posed a threat to humans, \"the proponent of an activity, rather than the public, should bear the burden of proof.\" But while the precautionary principle has not been enshrined in law in the United States, the European Union has incorporated the doctrine into many of its policies, based on [guidelines adopted in 2000](http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/00/96&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en). The plaintiffs in the LHC case directly charge the Center for Nuclear Energy Research, which operates the collider, with violating the EU's precautionary principle. However, the center is outside the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. Got a question about today's news? [Ask the Explainer](mailto:ask_the_explainer@yahoo.com).

World Food Program's executive director told the [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-food1apr01,1,5014433.story) that \"a perfect storm\" is hitting the world's hungry, as demand for aid surges while food prices skyrocket. Cost increases are [affecting most countries around the globe](http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hY6QytGQclZ5k8yFlaDr0VZin6IwD8VJULF00http:/ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hY6QytGQclZ5k8yFlaDr0VZin6IwD8VJULF00), with prices for dairy products up 80 percent, cooking oils up 50 percent, and grains up 42 percent from 2006 to 2007. (For more specifics on how prices have changed since 2000, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has [a handy chart](http://www.fao.org/worldfoodsituation/FoodPricesIndex).) Why are groceries getting so expensive all at once? Energy prices. The global food system is heavily dependent on petroleum, not just for shipping goods from one location to another but also for production, packaging, and processing. As the [price of oil rises](http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/hotstories/5663904.html)\u2014crude oil is currently hovering at around [$100 a barrel](http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/natural_resources/article3578231.ece)\u2014so do the costs of planting, harvesting, and delivering food. High oil prices have also created a secondary problem: The burgeoning interest in biofuels. In 2006, 14 percent of the total corn crop in the United States was converted into ethanol; by 2010, that figure will rise to 30 percent. When the production of corn intended for human or animal consumption decreases, prices go up. Why does this local shift in policy affect food prices around the world? The diversion of American corn into energy has a ripple effect for two reasons: First, the United States is the world's largest corn exporter, accounting for about 40 percent of global trade, so when corn-as-food production decreases here, costs go up everywhere. Second, when the price of corn increases, farmers in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere who use the crop to feed livestock look for cheaper alternatives, like wheat or [sorghum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorghum). These alternatives, in turn, become more expensive. Another factor is the improved standard of living in rapidly developing countries. The demand for foodstuffs like meat and dairy is on the rise in China and India, sending costs skyward not only for those items but for the grain used as cattle feed. Finally, weather deserves a share of the blame. Australia has seen bad droughts six years running, and last year there was major flooding in Argentina. Since both of these countries are major dairy exporters, milk and butter are pricier than they used to be. Got a question about today's news? [Ask the Explainer](mailto:ask_the_explainer@yahoo.com).

Buddhist monks and other Tibetans began protesting in and around Lhasa on [March 10](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/mar/12/china), the anniversary of a major uprising against Chinese rule. [Tensions have been flaring](http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-27-tibetcover_N.htm) in the region ever since, with some protests [turning violent](http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/03/20/tibet.unrest/). Tibet is a remote, impoverished mountain region with little arable land. Why does China care so much about keeping it? Nationalism. [China invaded Tibet](http://www.historybookshop.com/articles/events/tibet-chinese-invasion-ht.asp) in 1950, but Beijing asserts that its close relationship with the region stretches back to the 13th century, when first Tibet and then China were absorbed into the rapidly expanding Mongol empire. [The Great Khanate](http://depts.washington.edu/chinaciv/1xaryuan.htm), or the portion of the empire that contained China, Tibet, and most of East Asia, eventually became known as China's Yuan Dynasty. Throughout the Yuan and the subsequent Ming and Qing dynasties, Tibet remained a subordinate principality of China, though its degree of independence varied over the centuries. When British forces began making inroads into Tibet from India in the early 1900s, the Qing emperors forcefully reasserted their [suzerainty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzerainty) over the region. Soon after, [revolutionaries](http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O48-ChineseRevolutionof1911.html) overthrew the Qing emperor\u2014who, being [Manchu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu), was cast as a foreign presence in Han-majority China\u2014and formed a republic. Tibet took the opportunity to [assert its independence](http://books.google.com/books?id=Ecaeybfrl1IC&pg=PA20&dq=tibet+independence+1912+dalai+lama&lr=&sig=Lh2qm3tRo_ue44aAByKaVPzLhJ0) and, from 1912 to 1950, ruled itself autonomously. However, Tibetan sovereignty was never recognized by China, the United Nations, or any major Western power. Both [Sun Yat-sen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Yat-sen)'s Nationalists and their rivals, Mao Zedong's Communists, believed that Tibet remained fundamentally a part of China and felt a strong nationalistic drive to return the country to its Qing-era borders. The 1950 takeover of Tibet by Mao's army was billed as the [liberation](http://www.china.org.cn/english/13235.htm) of the region from the old, semi-feudal system, as well as from imperialist (i.e., British and American) influences. Resentment of the Chinese grew among Tibetans over the following decade, and armed conflicts broke out in various parts of the region. In March 1959, the capital of Lhasa erupted in a full-blown but short-lived [revolt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1959_Tibetan_uprising), during which the current [Dalai Lama](http://www.dalailama.com/) fled to India. He has lived there in exile ever since. There are also strategic and economic motives for China's attachment to Tibet. The region serves as a buffer zone between China on one side and India, Nepal, and Bangladesh on the other. The Himalayan mountain range provides an added level of security as well as a military advantage. Tibet also serves as a crucial water source for China and possesses a significant [mining industry](http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1592687,00.html). And Beijing has invested billions in Tibet over the past 10 years as part of its wide-ranging [economic development plan](http://www.infoexport.gc.ca/ie-en/DisplayDocument.jsp?did=14118) for Western China. Bonus Explainer: When are Buddhist monks allowed to get violent? When it's for a compassionate cause. Monks and nuns in Tibet take at least two, and sometimes three, [sets of vows](http://www.lotsawahouse.org/school/three_vows.html) that constrain their behavior. For most violations, the penalty is usually a confession that the act was committed. But if a monk were to kill another human being\u2014one of the most serious violations of the [Pratimoksha](http://www.lotsawahouse.org/school/pratimoksha_vows.html) vows\u2014he would be liable to expulsion from the monastery. That being said, there is a tradition in Tibetan mythology that could be used to justify taking violent action against an oppressor. The ninth-century king Langdarma, a follower of the [B\u00f6n tradition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B\u00c3\u00b6n), is popularly believed to have persecuted Buddhists during his reign. A monk assassinated him on the grounds that, by killing Langdarma, the monk was acting compassionately toward the tyrant\u2014taking bad karma upon himself in order to spare the king from accumulating the same through his despotic actions. It's important to note, however, that the actual extent to which monks were responsible for the violence in Tibet remains unclear. Monks instigated the initial demonstrations, but lay Tibetans may have ratcheted up those protests to riot status. Got a question about today's news?

The punishment visited on Sen. Hillary Clinton for her flagrant, hysterical, repetitive, pathological [lying about her visit to Bosnia](http://blog.washingtonpost.com/fact-checker/2008/03/hillarys_balkan_adventures_par.html) should be much heavier than it has yet been and should be exacted for much more than just the lying itself. There are two kinds of deliberate and premeditated deceit, commonly known as suggestio falsi and suppressio veri. (Neither of them is covered by the additionally lying claim of having \"misspoken.\") The first involves what seems to be most obvious in the present case: the putting forward of a bogus or misleading account of events. But the second, and often the more serious, means that the liar in question has also attempted to bury or to obscure something that actually is true. Let us examine how Sen. Clinton has managed to commit both of these offenses to veracity and decency and how in doing so she has rivaled, if not indeed surpassed, the disbarred and perjured hack who is her husband and tutor. I remember disembarking at the Sarajevo airport in the summer of 1992 after an agonizing flight on a U.N. relief plane that had had to \"corkscrew\" its downward approach in order to avoid Serbian flak and ground fire. As I hunched over to scuttle the distance to the terminal, a mortar shell fell as close to me as I ever want any mortar shell to fall. The vicious noise it made is with me still. And so is the shock I felt at seeing a civilized and multicultural European city bombarded round the clock by an ethno-religious militia under the command of fascistic barbarians. I didn't like the Clinton candidacy even then, but I have to report that many Bosnians were enthused by Bill Clinton's pledge, during that ghastly summer, to abandon the hypocritical and sordid neutrality of the George H.W. Bush/James Baker regime and to come to the defense of the victims of ethnic cleansing. I am recalling these two things for a reason. First, and even though I admit that I did once later misidentify a building in Sarajevo from a set of photographs, I can tell you for an absolute certainty that it would be quite impossible to imagine that one had undergone that experience at the airport if one actually had not. Yet Sen. Clinton, given repeated chances to modify her absurd claim to have operated under fire while in the company of her then-16-year-old daughter and a USO entertainment troupe, kept up a stone-faced and self-loving insistence that, yes, she had exposed herself to sniper fire in the cause of gaining moral credit and, perhaps to be banked for the future, national-security \"experience.\" This must mean either a) that she lies without conscience or reflection; or b) that she is subject to fantasies of an illusory past; or c) both of the above. Any of the foregoing would constitute a disqualification for the presidency of the United States. Yet this is only to underline the [YouTube version of events](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=It6JN7ALF7Y) and the farcical or stupid or Howard Wolfson (take your pick) aspects of the story. But here is the historical rather than personal aspect, which is what you should keep your eye on. Note the date of Sen. Clinton's visit to Tuzla. She went there in March 1996. By that time, the critical and tragic phase of the Bosnia war was effectively over, as was the greater part of her husband's first term. What had happened in the interim? In particular, what had happened to the 1992 promise, four years earlier, that genocide in Bosnia would be opposed by a Clinton administration? In the event, President Bill Clinton had not found it convenient to keep this promise. Let me quote from Sally Bedell Smith's admirable book on the happy couple, [For Love of Politics](http://www.amazon.com/Love-Politics-Inside-Clinton-White/dp/0812973453/): Taking the advice of Al Gore and National Security Advisor Tony Lake, Bill agreed to a proposal to bomb Serbian military positions while helping the Muslims acquire weapons to defend themselves\u2014the fulfillment of a pledge he had made during the 1992 campaign. But instead of pushing European leaders, he directed Secretary of State Warren Christopher merely to consult with them. When they balked at the plan, Bill quickly retreated, creating a \"perception of drift.\" The key factor in Bill's policy reversal was Hillary, who was said to have \"deep misgivings\" and viewed the situation as \"a Vietnam that would compromise health-care reform.\" The United States took no further action in Bosnia, and the \"ethnic cleansing\" by the Serbs was to continue for four more years, resulting in the deaths of more than 250,000 people. I can personally witness to the truth of this, too. I can remember, first, one of the Clintons' closest personal advisers\u2014Sidney Blumenthal\u2014referring with acid contempt to Warren Christopher as \"a blend of Pontius Pilate with Ichabod Crane.\" I can remember, second, a meeting with Clinton's then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin at the British Embassy. When I challenged him on the sellout of the Bosnians, he drew me aside and told me that he had asked the White House for permission to land his own plane at Sarajevo airport, if only as a gesture of reassurance that the United States had not forgotten its commitments. The response from the happy couple was unambiguous: He was to do no such thing, lest it distract attention from the first lady's health care \"initiative.\" It's hardly necessary for me to point out that the United States did not receive national health care in return for its acquiescence in the murder of tens of thousands of European civilians. But perhaps that is the least of it. Were I to be asked if Sen. Clinton has ever lost any sleep over those heaps of casualties, I have the distinct feeling that I could guess the answer. She has no tears for anyone but herself. In the end, and over her strenuous objections, the United States and its allies did rescue our honor and did put an end to Slobodan Milosevic and his state-supported terrorism. Yet instead of preserving a polite reticence about this, or at least an appropriate reserve, Sen. Clinton now has the obscene urge to claim the raped and slaughtered people of Bosnia as if their misery and death were somehow to be credited to her account! Words begin to fail one at this point. Is there no such thing as shame? Is there no decency at last? Let the memory of the truth, and the exposure of the lie, at least make us resolve that no Clinton ever sees the inside of the White House again. Much of the next president's job will involve cleaning up George W. Bush's messes: Iraq. Guantanamo. A government starved for revenue. Cheetos under the desk in the Oval Office. But in the case of health care, it's more about cleaning up a mess the president mostly ignored and only occasionally exacerbated. Here's what has happened: Since 2000, employer-based health insurance premiums have shot up 100 percent. Wage growth has hardly represented one-fifth of that. About 10 million Americans have joined the ranks of the uninsured, and according to at least one estimate, more than 100,000 Americans [have died](http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/27/1/58) because they lacked access to quality care. Health costs have continued their double-time march, and economists now estimate that, if left unchecked, government health spending will be about 37 percent of the GDP by 2050. Add in private health spending, and the Brookings Institution's Henry Aron estimates that \"the income that's left over for everything else in the economy, other than taxes and private health care spending, stops growing and ... actually declines.\" On health care, the vital question for the next president isn't merely what to do but how to do it. Reform requires much more than a willing executive, as anyone who worked in the Clinton White House between the years of 1992 and 1994 can tell you. The problem is not just policy\u2014Washington is stuffed with wonks and idea entrepreneurs eager to explain how to fix the health care system\u2014it's politics. Without 60 votes in the Senate, you don't have a policy. You have a position. And nobody is going to get good, affordable medical care from a position paper. Sadly, there's a long history of executives coming in with a clear position paper explaining what they want to do to fix health care but no political strategy for how to achieve it. The next president need not repeat that mistake. He or she needs, first, a clear political approach\u2014based, in part, around a solid understanding of the mistakes made by the Clintons in 1994\u2014that's backed up by a solid set of policy principles. Do it first. One of the problems with the Clinton health care process was that it took so long to get a bill to Congress. By the time Clinton actually sent solid legislation to Capitol Hill, in November of 1993, he'd already spent most of his initial political capital on the North American Free Trade Agreement, gays in the military, and the Deficit Reduction Act and had been battered by the beginning of Whitewater; the crisis in Haiti; and the massacre of American soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia. At the risk of offending other contributors to this series, I'd advise the next president not to leave Congress to dither while you take your hits and pursue other priorities. Having run, in part, on the issue of improving health care, he or she will have something of a mandate upon entering office. Do not let that dissipate. On Day One, the next president must ask Congress to begin an open process that will put a bill on his or her desk by Day 100, include public hearings in the process, and, on the 100th day, give a prime-time presidential speech to a joint session of Congress. The president should ask for meetings with both the majority and the minority leader on this issue every 25 days. And if there's no bill by the 100th day, it's time to start using the bully pulpit to press those who would delay. Don't write a bill. Speaking of Congress, remember that old Schoolhouse Rock skit \"I'm Just a Bill?\" Remember how the bill described its birth? \"Some folks back home decided they wanted a law passed, so they called their local congressman, and he said, 'You're right, there ought to be a law.' Then he sat down and wrote me out and introduced me to Congress, and I became a bill.\" Well, perhaps in 1994, Bill Clinton had forgotten that teaching. He convened a massive task force that eventually grew into 30 separate working groups that boasted 500 separate participants. The point of this task force? Er, to write a bill. Predictably, those arms of government actually tasked with writing bills felt a bit left out. Sara Rosenbaum, now the chair of health policy at George Washington University, was eventually charged with drafting the Clinton plan. Looking back, she says, \"I was the biggest mistake of the Clinton health care bill. It was a terrible error to have the president doing what Congress was supposed to do. It was a misuse of the relationship between the legislative branch and the executive branch. The executive branch is supposed to generate action, and the committees are supposed to actually take the action. By sending a 1,300-page bill, you're writing a detailed blueprint for the policy rather than using the congressional process to create a consensus.\" That last bit is important. The policy-creation process centered in the executive branch is good at creating policies. But the congressional process is good\u2014or at least as good a system as we have\u2014at creating working legislative coalitions. And that's what we need. So the next president needs to announce that he or she wants to do health reform, but through an open process, centered in the Congress, that includes lots of public feedback. Let someone else take the credit. In part, the 1994 effort was foiled by simple Republican intransigence. Bill Kristol, then a Republican strategist, wrote a famed memo titled \"Defeating President Clinton's Health Care Proposal,\" in which he warned, \"Any Republican urge to negotiate a 'least bad' compromise with the Democrats, and thereby gain momentary public credit for helping the president 'do something' about health care, should be resisted.\" Similarly, Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, advised that the party's midterm hopes relied on \"not having health care pass.\" Cynical? Sure. But Kristol and McInturff were responding to very real electoral incentives. Much of the electorate still considers health care a Democratic issue. This is particularly true when the reform charge is led by a Democratic president and named after him or her. For Republicans to assist in passing health reform, then, would be to give Democrats a massive accomplishment they can take with them into the election. If the next president to try ambitious heath reform is to succeed where the last failed, he or she will need to hang back a little bit and change the political incentives. Let the congressional process work, and allow the bill to be named after two powerful senators\u2014one of whom should be a Republican looking for a legacy. He can pull in a few of his powerful colleagues who also see themselves as historic legislators, and you'll be closer to your majority. And don't worry: Even if the bill is called Baucus-Grassley, you'll still be the one signing it. Have a political strategy. Health care is complicated. Voters are afraid of losing what they have. The electorate has a lot of status quo bias. Powerful stakeholders will oppose the final bill. So the next president needs to deploy an aggressive communications strategy from the first day. The commander in chief will need to make sure that his or her allies are well-funded and ready to rebut attacks; that the war room is well-staffed with a powerful set of talking points; and that the various stakeholders know that attempts to kill reform will not only lead them to be written out of this bill, but to seeing their own political priorities impeded in the future. Remember when Teddy Roosevelt said, \"Speak softly and carry a big stick?\" Well, by letting Congress write this bill, you're speaking softly. The political strategy is your big stick. In the past, the executive branch has been so concerned with creating a bill, they've forgotten to sell it. By outsourcing the creation to Congress, you can free up resources for the PR blitz. Have principles more than a policy. Don't take the above to mean you should go into the reform process without any idea of what you want. It's just that what you want shouldn't be too specific. Health reform is meaningless if it isn't actually universal, if it doesn't make the system more seamless and integrated, and if it doesn't reform the insurance industry so it can begin competing on price and quality rather than risk-shifting and denials of coverage. Optimally, you'll also break the link between employers and health insurance and create a public plan that can compete with private plans, so consumers can choose between health insurance that seeks profit and health insurance that seeks health. So those should be your principles: universality, integration, insurance industry reform, a transition away from employer-based insurance, and public-private competition. You can advocate for those things without getting too hung up on the details. Rather than being dogmatic about policy and agnostic about politics, as your predecessors were, you should be dogmatic about politics and, if not agnostic about policy, more focused on ends than means. President Bush's environmental policies may be alarming, but they are nevertheless worthy of study. This administration has used every last hammer, wrench, and saw in the executive toolbox to pursue its ideas about how we should use energy, land, water, and other elements of nature. And so when the next president comes into office, he or she will similarly need to deftly deploy every trick of agency rule-making, executive order, enforcement of existing laws, and cooperation with Congress to reverse the damage done by the Bush administration and to usher in a new order. Climate change. This is the green elephant in the living room. The Bush administration squandered eight crucial years by stalling and blocking any concerted national action to slow global warming. Candidates Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and, to a lesser extent, John McCain all favor strong federal climate legislation. If none of the current climate change bills (for a [roundup, click here](http://www.wri.org/stories/2007/02/global-warming-legislation-110th-congress)) gets passed this year, the new president must immediately propose a new law to slash greenhouse-gas emissions in the first State of the Union address and make its passage a first-year priority. The fate of the planet\u2014no exaggeration\u2014potentially depends on the United States moving quickly from climate laggard to climate leader. The new president should also use his or her executive powers to shift national policy\u2014no need to wait for Congress. The U.S. Supreme Court [ruled](http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/06pdf/05-1120.pdf) last year that the Environmental Protection Agency has the power to regulate carbon dioxide emissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has done little since then, and a new president can direct the agency to start writing rules to that effect immediately. Likewise, a new administration can get out of the way of the various states that have taken climate change policy into their own hands. Where the Bush administration [blocked](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/19/AR2007121902012.html) California's request to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions, a new president can embrace California's initiative and encourage the other states seeking to experiment with environmental regulation in their own backyards. On his or her own, a new president can also spur international action to fight global warming. Appointing a high-profile climate czar\u2014Al Gore might be available and willing\u2014could jump-start international climate treaty negotiations. Heck, maybe the new president can even show up occasionally, too. Back at home, a new high-level interagency climate office could begin to coordinate the economic, security, and environmental dimensions of the climate crisis, which will be with us for generations. Climate is big, but the new president has other work to do, too. Over the past eight years, the Bush administration has systematically dismantled environmental protections by easing enforcement, reinterpreting policies, and blocking the imposition of stricter standards. A new administration should use the same executive powers to reverse course. Here are some representative messes the new president can clean up using executive authority: New source review. Changes to this program with a snoozer of a name reveal the Bush administration at its most enterprising. New source review is the government's means of propelling the cleanup of aged power plants and industrial facilities. In the late 1990s, according to [this great overview](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3D61E30F937A35757C0A9629C8B63) by Bruce Barcott in the New York Times Magazine, the power companies were on the verge of being forced into making widespread improvements to their emissions controls, changes that would have cut dangerous sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pollution. Then the Bush Department of Energy came along and spearheaded the charge to gut new source review, steamrolling Christine Todd Whitman, then-head of the Environmental Protection Agency, and the agency's director of enforcement, Eric Schaeffer, [who resigned over the controversy](http://www.grist.org/news/muck/2002/03/01/). The new Bush administration rules allowed the utility companies to wriggle out of their fix: They got 10 years' reprieve for installing any new pollution-control equipment, and they could make significant changes to their plants and still claim they were doing \"routine maintenance,\" thereby avoiding expensive pollution control upgrades. The next president should announce on his or her first day in office that it's time to reconsider these rules and to come up with standards that will hold power companies accountable for the muck they spew into the air. Ozone standard. Just two weeks ago, the administration announced that because of the president's \"last minute intervention,\" [as the Washington Post put it](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/13/AR2008031304175_pf.html), the EPA would weaken the agency's new ozone limits. After setting a tighter standard for long-term exposure of forests and crops to ozone than for short-term human exposure, the EPA, under pressure from the Office of Management and Budget and the White House, scrapped the separate long-term standard. The proposed limits were already more lax than those recommended by the EPA's scientific advisers. The new president should reverse this order\u2014and others like it\u2014by following the recommendations of scientists mandated by law to set scientifically based standards that protect human health and ecosystems and agricultural crops. More power to the White House. Here's another technical rule change with broad implications, ripe for reconsideration. Last year, [the White House increased its sway over government agencies](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/30/washington/30rules.html) by requiring each agency to select a political appointee to oversee new rule-making and the guidance provided to regulated industries. The new president should scrap this order outright. While analyzing the costs and benefits is essential to efficient regulation, the Bush change undermines agency professionals and leaves regulatory initiatives to the political whims of the White House. The Bureau of Land Management. Under Bush, the Bureau of Land Management has opened large swaths of land in states like Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, and Oregon to oil and gas drilling, often ignoring scientists' concerns about the effects on wildlife habitat. In the Pinedale, Wyo., field office, [an internal review leaked in 2006](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/21/AR2006022101793.html?referrer=email) stated that there was often \"no evaluation, analysis or compiling\" of all the data demonstrating the consequences of such drilling on the surrounding land and water. The new president should restore the safeguards in the process for granting new oil and drilling leases, so development doesn't needlessly trash the patches of landscape that still look like the Old West. Public science. Politicians often try to control the release of information, but the Bush administration has truly taken meddling with the findings of government scientists to an entirely new level. From [sex education to mercury contamination and climate projections](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/interference/a-to-z-guide-to-political.html), the administration has blocked, altered, and suppressed crucial data and conclusions it doesn't like. The next president needs to give scientific expertise the respect it deserves by reporting results honestly and supporting work that's rigorous even when it's not expedient. Or profitable. Whether or not that helps halt global warming or preserve the landscape, it's a change worth making. Don't count on the next president to undo George W. Bush's legal policies in the war on terrorism. All three remaining presidential candidates have pledged to close the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, pay greater respect to law, tamp down unilateral presidential powers, and enhance America's stature abroad. But many controversial Bush administration policies have already been revised to satisfy congressional and judicial critics. And after receiving a few harrowing threat briefings and absorbing the awesome personal responsibility of keeping Americans safe, the new commander in chief won't rush to eliminate the Bush program as it stands next January. He or she will realize that any legal climb-down that is later perceived as even indirectly responsible for an attack would be a personal and political disaster. Aggressive counterterrorism policies will thus continue into the next presidency. They will, however, be wrapped in more attractive packaging and adjusted in ways appropriate for an indefinite conflict. Some suggestions for how to achieve these goals: Boost trust and credibility. Many people accuse the Bush administration of exaggerating the terror threat for political gain, but the truth is nearer the opposite: The Bush administration frets about homeland attacks more than it lets on. Yet as 9/11 recedes from national memory, the public worries less about the terror threat it cannot see and more about aggressive powers and policies whose purpose it cannot fully appreciate. This growing gap between the government's view of the terror threat and the public's is an enormous challenge for any president. \"[P]ublic sentiment is everything,\" Abraham Lincoln once said. \"With public sentiment nothing can fail; without it, nothing can succeed.\" The next government can narrow this credibility gap by fighting the intelligence community's notorious tendency to over-classify, and by making public more threat information so the nation can better understand what it faces. But more information from even a rhetorically gifted president will not be enough. The president's words are more credible when echoed by officials who do not share all of his political aims. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt began to prepare the nation for war in the spring of 1940, he appointed Henry Stimson and Frank Knox\u2014Republicans who rabidly opposed his New Deal\u2014as secretaries of war and Navy, respectively. These men were invaluable in convincing the Congress and the nation that FDR acted in good faith in taking aggressive steps against the growing but underappreciated German threat in the year before Pearl Harbor. The next president should follow FDR's lead by filling important national security positions with individuals from the other party. Work with Congress. The next president can further enhance the credibility of war-on-terror policies by getting Congress\u2014especially political opponents in Congress\u2014onboard. The president can share more national-security data with Congress than with the public. When Congress supports aggressive policies based on this information, the nation is more likely to accept that the president is acting in good faith. After 16 Democrats in the Senate and 41 Democrats in the House joined Republicans last August to give a weakened president unprecedented surveillance powers, it became much harder for critics to maintain that the terror threat did not warrant such broad powers. When the president presses Congress to take a stand on war-on-terror issues, he and the nation receive other benefits as well. (This is a central theme of Ben Wittes' forthcoming [Law and the Long War](http://www.amazon.com/Law-Long-War-Future-Justice/dp/159420179X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1206998184&sr=1-1).) Forcing Congress to act spreads responsibility for policies when things go bad, as John Kerry learned when he tried to run away from his 2002 Iraq vote in the 2004 presidential election. Congressional debates educate the country about the nature and stakes of the terror threat. And congressional approval increases judicial support that will be crucial in the long war. The Supreme Court's main objection to President Bush's counterterrorism policies has been that he's acted without or contrary to Congress. But the court almost always goes along with national-security policies supported by both political branches. There is no guarantee, of course, that the next president can persuade Congress about the terror threat or that Congress will not play politics with a terrorism issue. But the politics of terrorism usually cut in favor of aggressive action, and a president who genuinely engages Congress can almost always get what he or she needs for national security. Give the telecommunications carriers immunity. There is bipartisan agreement that the legal framework for surveillance is outdated and must be amended to give the president more flexibility to surveil potential threats, subject to congressional and judicial review. The most contested remaining issue in this area is whether Congress should confer legal immunity on telecommunications firms that cooperated with the administration's Terrorist Surveillance Program. Private-industry cooperation with government is vital to finding and tracking terrorists. If telecoms are punished for their good-faith reliance on executive-branch representations, they will not help the government except when clearly compelled to do so by law. Only full immunity, including retroactive immunity, will guarantee full cooperation. The Democrat-controlled Senate intelligence committee recently agreed, by a vote of 13-2, but the full Congress has thus far balked. The next president should push hard to see that full telecom immunity prevails. Close Guantanamo. There were two justifications for using Guantanamo as a detention facility. The first was to minimize judicial scrutiny. The courts have chipped away at this rationale for years and will likely eliminate it altogether when\u2014as most commentators expect\u2014the Supreme Court announces this June that U.S. constitutional protections extend to the base. The second justification for Guantanamo was to avoid frightening and possibly endangering U.S. citizens. This justification still has force but is outweighed by the fact that Guantanamo is now widely viewed\u2014justifiably or not\u2014as a damaging symbol of American mistakes in the war on terrorism. One should not, however, underestimate the political difficulty of putting Guantanamo out of business. It will be interesting to watch the dance among states clamoring not to become home to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his friends. Establish a national-security court. Closing Guantanamo begs the question of what should be done with the 100 to 150 remaining detainees whom no responsible president will release, as well as any future detainees. Right now, 15 detainees are scheduled to be tried in military commissions. But trial by military commission is [not the solution](http://www.slate.com/id/2184379/). The politically damaged commissions are disliked by the same military tasked with running them, and they will be subject to legal and political challenges for a decade. The next government should ditch commissions altogether and place the incapacitation of terrorists under the supervision of a national-security court composed of federal judges with life tenure. The national-security court would have two jobs: trying terrorists and reviewing the detention of those who cannot be tried. Trials could be governed by modified rules of evidence, secrecy, and security that are constitutionally valid but not currently available in ordinary criminal trials. National-security court trials would be more legitimate than military trials because they would be run by independent Article III judges rather than military judges. And they would attract fewer legal challenges because unlike military commissions, most of the procedural and substantive rules they'll employ would be time-tested. But criminal trials are not always feasible. Sometimes the government has credible information that a detainee is very dangerous but cannot prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt with nonclassified information in a manner consistent with civilian standards of justice, even as modified. When the government certifies that this is so, terrorists should be detained pursuant to a system of preventive detention akin to the one now in place in Guantanamo, but supervised instead by the national-security court. Congress should ensure that this system applies to citizen and noncitizen detainees alike and has procedural protections appropriate for indefinite detention, including appointed attorneys with proper security clearances, access to all information the government has on the detainee, and ongoing review to ensure that the detainee remains a threat. Work with allies to establish an international legal framework for terrorists. Last week, [John McCain called for](http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/872473dd-9ccb-4ab4-9d0d-ec54f0e7a497.htm) a \"new international understanding on the disposition of dangerous detainees under our control.\" This is a good idea, not because of a squishy commitment to internationalism but because an international consensus on how to treat detainees would foster deeper international cooperation crucial in thwarting terrorists. To achieve this goal, the United States must stop talking about which international laws do not govern the detention of terrorists and start talking about which ones do. The Supreme Court took a step in this direction when it determined two years ago that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions\u2014which provides minimal and rather abstract rights to enemy combatants\u2014governs the conflict with al-Qaida. The United States can flesh out the meaning of Common Article 3 by drawing on some aspects of Article 75 of the First 1977 Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, which provides more elaborate minimum-warfare standards. The United States has rightly opposed ratifying the protocol in all its details for fear of legitimizing terrorism, and Article 75 itself contains vague provisions that in the wrong hands might be viewed as too restrictive. But these uncertainties are also an opportunity for the United States to draw on higher international standards to flesh out the meaning of Common Article 3 while at the same time shaping these standards to its own conception of appropriate justice. There is more room for international agreement on these issues than one might think. The foreign affairs committee of the House of Commons recently concluded that the Geneva Conventions \"lack clarity and are out of date\" and urged the British government to \"update the conventions in a way that deals more satisfactorily with asymmetric warfare, with international terrorism, with the status of irregular combatants, and with the treatment of detainees.\" The German foreign minister and an important European security organization have made similar recommendations. And last year, John Bellinger\u2014the State Department legal adviser who has worked hard to bridge differences with allies on these topics\u2014convened an important meeting at West Point with legal advisers from seven allied nations to forge consensus on these issues. The next president with fresh goodwill should build on these developments. Fix interrogation. In 2005 and 2006, Congress went along with a two-track approach to interrogating terrorists suspected of having information crucial to stopping an attack. It held the military to a very high standard but allowed the CIA to maintain a program of classified interrogation techniques that must not amount to torture or cruel, inhuman, humiliating, or degrading treatment. Earlier this month, Congress changed its mind and tried to extend the DoD rules to the CIA, but President Bush vetoed the bill. The way forward on this issue builds [on a proposal by former President Bill Clinton](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6113357). Congress should require the next president to make a classified finding\u2014akin to findings used for covert operations\u2014giving reasons why aggressive techniques are required. This finding and the subsequent interrogations should be reviewed for legality and effectiveness by an internal executive-branch body and reported to the congressional intelligence committees. This approach would maintain the option of using lawful interrogation techniques that might stave off a crisis, while at the same time addressing legitimate concerns about accountability, legal compliance, and abuse. We are surprisingly close to putting policy issues in the war on terrorism on a sound legal footing appropriate for the long term. The most important issue for the next administration to resolve is the system for incapacitating terrorists. Beyond that, what the next president most needs to fix are appearances and processes in dealing with the public, Congress, and the world. This is no small thing. A major lesson of the last seven years is the centrality of these soft factors to the successful exercise of the hard power needed to defeat the terror threat. President George W. Bush's successor should renounce his monarchy. It betters the instruction of King George III, which provoked the Declaration of Independence. Among other things, the 44th president of the United States should do the following promptly upon taking office: Transfer the impending trials of six \"high-value\" al-Qaida detainees before Spanish Inquisition-like military commissions to civilian courts; repudiate President Bush's kidnappings, secret imprisonments, and maltreatments of suspected al-Qaida supporters abroad on his say-so alone\u2014a page from Hobbes' state of nature; denounce signing statements that declare the president's intent to disregard provisions of bills he has signed into law because he disputes their constitutionality; and end the snobbish custom of former government Brahmins preening in their honorifics after leaving office. The Founding Fathers prohibited titles of nobility to encourage a nonhierarchical culture that honors equality before the law. Robert Draper recounts in Dead Certain: The Presidency of George W. Bush an alarming averment by the current occupant of the White House. Without blushing, Mr. Bush insisted to his biographer: \"You can't learn lessons by reading. Or at least I couldn't.\" Here's a to-do list for his successor: Put an end to the imperial presidency. President Bush has usurped what Gen. Washington and the Founding Fathers reprehended: unchecked power that sacrifices fundamental liberties to trust in the president. To paraphrase Lord Acton, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Just ask President Bush's kidnap-and-torture victims, including Khaled El-Masri, Abu Omar, or Maher Arar. The Constitution's marquee is checks and balances, a system predicated upon a suspicion of human nature. James Madison sermonized in \"The Federalist No. 51\": \"If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.\" To restore the constitutional equilibrium envisioned by the Founding Fathers, the next presidential inaugural should enumerate the following particulars. End the \"war on terror\" as a legal paradigm. International terrorists are criminals, not warriors. The next president should see to it that terrorists will be captured, interrogated, prosecuted, and punished according to civilian law. The United States is not at war with international terrorism. The next president should ensure that we do not brandish the weapons of war in lieu of traditional law enforcement against international terrorists. If the conflict of the United States with international terrorism amounts to a war, then this nation is permanently at war\u2014a condition the Founding Fathers insisted was irreconcilable with freedom. War crowns the president with monumental powers and sweeping secrecy. It tends to gratify popular bigotries and encourages a conflation of any dissent with treason. Remember the imprisonment of Eugene Debs; the concentration camps for 120,000 Japanese-Americans; the burglary of the office of Lewis Fielding, Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist; and President Bush's water-boarding and warrantless spying on American citizens in criminal contravention of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. The next president must recognize the fundamental dangers of a permanent state of war and the granting of infinite power as commander in chief Abolish military commissions. Under the new president, military commissions should be promptly abolished. No citizen or noncitizen should be detained without charges as an unlawful enemy combatant. No detainee in the custody of the United States should ever again be denied an opportunity to challenge the factual or legal basis for his detention before an impartial judge in habeas corpus proceedings. The Classified Information Procedures Act of 1980 should be employed to prosecute terrorists without compromising national security. Ramzi Yousef, Zacarias Moussaoui, and Jose Padilla\u2014among other accused terrorists\u2014all have been successfully prosecuted under CIPA. Existing criminal conspiracy law should be employed to thwart terrorist plots in their pre-embryonic stages. Although we seem to have forgotten this fact of late, the criminal law is both forward- and backward-looking. Withdraw all U.S. troops from foreign countries. The Declaration of Independence explains that the purpose of government is to secure unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The United States was not created to build an empire, to aggrandize government, or to purge the planet of nondemocratic regimes. Accordingly, the next president should announce that we are withdrawing all U.S. troops from foreign countries and that, hereinafter, all the nation's military resources will be devoted to building missile, electronic, and other defenses against potential foreign attacks. The United States lacks the wisdom necessary to spin modern democratic gold from centuries of despotic flax by military force or otherwise. Iraq and Afghanistan are clear proof. Further, the United States has no moral responsibility for the destiny of persons outside its jurisdiction who pay no taxes to support the government and pledge no allegiance to the republic. Restore both oversight and transparency. No president is infallible. Executive-branch decisions or policies made without congressional vetting or oversight are prone to staggering mistakes\u2014for example, the Bay of Pigs, the Vietnam War, or post-Saddam Iraq. Endogamous thinking is as foolhardy as endogamous marriages. And secrecy, moreover, breeds lawlessness, maladministration, and abuses. Sunshine is the best disinfectant. The next president must restore the tools of judicial and congressional oversight that have been eroded if not obliterated in the past eight years. Cabin the scope of executive privilege. The next president must end the practice of invoking executive privilege to shield confidential presidential communications or advice from any examination by Congress absent an illicit legislative purpose, including exposure for the sake of political embarrassment. The next president should not defend the expansive claims of executive privilege of President Bush used to justify the nonappearances of former White House Counsel Harriet Miers and Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten before the House judiciary committee in the investigation of the firings of nine U.S. attorneys. The next president should initiate criminal prosecutions of the two for contempt of the House of Representatives. Restore the role of warrants under FISA. The next president must immediately agree to go back to collecting foreign intelligence in conformity with the individualized warrant provisions of FISA. He or she should not seek an extension of the Protect America Act\u2014which authorizes group warrants akin to general writs of assistance, which were anathema to the Founding Fathers and prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. We have yet to be provided any evidence that FISA handicaps the president's collection of foreign intelligence any more than do congressional restrictions on breaking and entering homes, opening mail, or torture. FISA functioned without complaint from any president for more than two decades before President Bush determined, in secret, to defy it in the aftermath of 9/11. And at this very moment, the president is operating under the old FISA law because the Protect America Act has not been extended with no proof of heightened danger to the nation. The next president should also convene a grand jury to determine whether the government participants, in flouting FISA, should be criminally prosecuted\u2014including President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. If the rule of law means anything, it means that occupants of the highest offices must turn square constitutional corners. Restore the state secrets privilege to ensure justice to victims of constitutional misconduct. This doctrine is a rule of evidence fashioned by the courts, not a constitutional requirement. The Bush administration has successfully invoked the state secrets privilege to deny a remedy for victims of its own constitutional wrongdoing, for example, the kidnapping, imprisonment, and maltreatment of Khaled El-Masri. When he sued the culpable unnamed CIA operatives, his case was dismissed because the identities of the constitutional scofflaws were a state secret, a ruling more Kafkaesque than Kafka. The new president should submit legislation that would require a default judgment in favor of victims of unconstitutional conduct if the state secrets privilege is invoked by the president to deny the plaintiffs a fair opportunity to prove their claims. Torture should be categorically renounced. President Bush has hedged on whether he would torture suspected al-Qaida detainees in hopes of extracting intelligence. There is no evidence that torture works. The Defense Department and the FBI renounce water-boarding, and intelligence veterans concur that information derived from torture is worthless. Moreover, if the United States tortures, the risk of torture to our own captured soldiers climbs exponentially. The new president should categorically renounce torture. It cannot be justified pragmatically. And no civilized nation stoops to imitate the savagery of its enemies. The ultimate stewards of the Constitution are We the People. Grover Cleveland amplified this in his first inaugural address: \"Every citizen owes to the country a vigilant watch and close scrutiny of its public servants and a fair and reasonable estimate of their fidelity and usefulness. Thus is the people's will impressed upon the whole framework of our civil polity ... and this is the price of our liberty and the inspiration of our faith in the Republic.\" Identifying what needs to be fixed in the field of education is easy: the No Child Left Behind Act, currently up for reauthorization but stalled in Congress pending the next election. The elaborate law requires schools to test the bejeezus out of elementary- and middle-school students in reading and math, to test them again in high school, and to sprinkle in a few science tests along the way. Schools posting consistently poor test scores are supposed to be punished so that they'll clean up their acts and allow NCLB's ultimate goal to be achieved in 2014. The act imagines that essentially all students across the country will be \"proficient\" in that year, meaning that they'll all pass the battery of standardized tests required by the NCLB. Hence the act's catchy title. NCLB was enacted in 2001 with huge bipartisan support, though many Democrats in Congress have since disclaimed if not denounced it, presumably having had some time to read it. The act is at once the Bush administration's signature piece of education legislation, its most significant domestic policy initiative, and the most intrusive federal education law in our nation's history. The federal government provides less than 10 percent of all education funding, yet NCLB drives education policy in every school district in the country. In short, it's a big deal. It's also in need of repair. No one\u2014conservative or liberal, Democrat or Republican\u2014doubts that. That's the easy part. The hard part is how to fix it. Let's start with what not to do. Don't scrap it. Some reformers advocate scrapping the whole thing and starting anew. Well-known education author/activist Jonathan Kozol recently went so far as to stage what he termed a \"partial\" hunger strike (others mercilessly called it a \"diet\") to protest the act. Efforts like Kozol's, designed to torpedo the act, are rash. NCLB has big problems, but its core ideas\u2014creating high goals for all schools, ensuring accountability for meeting them, and focusing attention on disadvantaged and minority students who are too often ignored\u2014are worth retaining. That's why both the New York Times and writers for the National Review have praised the basic idea of NCLB. Don't stop all testing; stop stupid testing. Most of the problems caused by the act stem from its ridiculous test-and-punish regime. Specifically, the act promotes the heavy use and misuse not just of tests, but of stupid tests. This isn't a reason to abandon all testing; it is a reason, however, to come up with better tests and better ways to use those tests to judge schools. There are three problems, in particular, that need addressing. We don't know enough about school quality. Current test results don't tell us all we need to know about schools. Far from it. Students are tested in reading and math and a little in science. Reading, math, and science are important, but so are social studies, history, literature, geography, art, and music. Instead of telling us how schools are doing in these other subjects, NCLB is turning them into endangered species by pushing schools\u2014especially those that are struggling\u2014to downplay if not ignore subjects not tested. Many tests that are given further narrow the focus of education by relying on multiple-choice questions that reward memorization and regurgitation rather than analytical and creative thinking. What we think we know may be wrong. The second problem is that looking at just a sheet of test scores is a lousy way to judge school quality. Standardized test results tend to track socioeconomic status. As a teacher once remarked, the most accurate prediction you can make based on a student's test score is her parents' income. Teachers and schools with middle-class kids will invariably look better than those with poor kids if the only measure is how many students in a particular year pass a test. What we can't tell from scores alone, because they don't tell us where students started or how much they progressed over the year, is the value that a particular teacher or school has added to a student's education. Basing teacher and school evaluations on a snapshot of a year's test scores makes about as much sense as judging investment advisers based on how much money they are managing instead of the gains they earn for their clients. NCLB creates perverse incentives. The third and most fundamental problem has to do with perverse incentives. Schools must show annual improvements on test scores or face increasingly severe sanctions and the stigma of being labeled as failing. NCLB couples this punitive scheme with utter laxity regarding the standards and tests themselves. States get to develop their own standards, create their own tests, and set their own passing rates. Imagine if the EPA told the auto industry it would be fined heavily for polluting too much but let automakers decide for themselves what counts as \"too much\" pollution. That's basically how NCLB works. It didn't take states very long to figure out how to play this weird little game: Avoid failure by lowering the bar! And that's exactly what some did, either by making the tests easier or simply lowering the score needed to be considered \"proficient.\" As a result of shenanigans like these, most state tests are not very hard to pass. That many schools still post poor scores is a sign of how far we still need to travel, but it's important to recognize that, at a very basic level, this whole thing is a sham. NCLB, despite lofty rhetoric to the contrary, is not about equalizing opportunities in poor and rich, city and suburban schools; it's about making sure kids can learn some of the basics. No less, for sure, but also no more. So what can the next president do to fix this mess? Propose an amended NCLB for reauthorization and make sure the new version contains at least three key changes: Standardize the standards. It's time to create national standards and tests in at least reading, math, science, and social studies/history. National tests in the past have been nonstarters politically, but they have always polled well, and some politicians are starting to come around. The reality is that the current federal-state compromise isn't working and doesn't make sense in a shrinking and flattening world. Why should we expect less of a student in Mississippi than in Massachusetts? Do fractions and algebra matter in North Carolina but not North Dakota? It's worth noting here that the best high-school students already take national tests, though we don't call them that. We call them Advanced Placement tests. No one argues that it would be better to have 50 different AP tests in American history instead of one. Why should only our best students have the advantage of a high-quality, national testing system? Administer fewer tests. National tests should be given less often, perhaps in only fourth, eighth, and 11th grades. This would provide relief from the relentless test march that characterizes elementary- and middle-school years, which would give breathing room for subjects like music and art while concentrating attention on key thresholds in education. Reducing the overall amount of tests should also improve the quality of the tests themselves. Rank schools; don't prescribe punishments. The federal government should get out of the business of telling states how to reform and punish their schools, and we should drop 2014 as our rendezvous with perfection. It's a gimmick that has outlived its usefulness and is now causing more harm than good as states grow increasingly desperate to find ways to avoid the looming possibility that most of their schools will be labeled as failing. The federal government should instead, right now, create a system to rank every school within a state. A ranking system will provide both crucial information and create ongoing pressure for reform. It will also take away the incentive to game the testing system. Because some schools will always be ranked higher than others, there's no reason to try to make all students look as if they're from Lake Wobegon. Scores on national tests should be one factor in the rankings but not the only one. School quality should also be measured using value-added assessments, crediting schools that make exceptional progress with their students, regardless of where those students started. Other criteria should include graduation rates, measured fairly and uniformly; college-attendance rates; and parental satisfaction. Still other criteria, such as advancement from grade to grade, might be used for elementary and middle schools. Ranking systems aren't perfect, but using multiple criteria to rank schools should provide a much clearer and fuller picture of school quality. States can then decide on their own how they want to sanction or assist the low-performing schools. If and when NCLB is fixed, the next president should concentrate on two key issues: teachers and preschool. Teachers and money. Math and science teachers are in short supply, and there aren't enough good teachers in high-poverty and high-minority schools. A partial answer to this problem has been known for a long time. It's called money. To attract more and better qualified teachers, and to attract them to particular subjects and particular schools, we need to pay them more. The federal government has money. You see where this is headed. Teachers and prestige. Money alone is not enough. Respect, prestige, and decent working conditions also matter. The federal government cannot monitor working conditions in tens of thousands of schools, but it can create a teaching program that restores prestige to the profession. Teach for America\u2014which places recent college graduates for two-year stints in some of the most difficult schools in the nation\u2014is inundated with applications. In recent years, they've had to turn down four out of every five applicants, most from very good colleges. Indeed, in one year, 10 percent of the entire senior classes at Yale and Dartmouth applied. The federal government should create a similar program by agreeing to reimburse at least some of the college expenses of those who enter teaching. Colleges and universities should also chip in, much as law schools cover the student loans of their graduates who go into public service. The longer the service, the more loans forgiven. The federal government should use this as a model to encourage college graduates to go into teaching\u2014and to stay there for more than two years. Preschool. It's clear that many children should start school before kindergarten. The benefits of high-quality preschool, especially for children from poorer families, easily outweigh the costs. States have recognized this and have pumped billions of dollars into preschool education over the last decade, but millions of children remain without access. The federal government, in conjunction with the states, should strive to provide access at least to all 4-year-olds whose families cannot afford a high-quality preschool on their own. This would be both a politically popular measure and one of the single best investments any level of government could make. More could be done, of course, but this is plenty for starters. All of these fixes will take real leadership and real money. But they're worthwhile and certainly better investments than our current response to educational failure: building more prisons. Perhaps the only thing that's actually improved over the last eight years under President Bush is technology (if not tech policy). In the sense that Nixon presided over an age of great films like The Godfather, the Bush era was also the age of Wikipedia, search engines, YouTube, and Facebook. But the Bush system of benign neglect can only go so far, leaving plenty to fix as soon as the next president takes office. Here are a few suggestions for things we can fix right away: Appoint a broadband czar. Most people in technology will tell you that the leading problem today\u2014the one thing sinking all boats, so to speak\u2014is the broadband last mile, the final connection between people and the Internet. Since 2000, computers have become faster, hard drives cheaper, and free e-mail better, but for the vast majority of Americans, Internet access remains clunky. Same goes for wireless broadband (cell phones with good Internet access), which is arriving, but slowly and expensively. These facts limit what everyone in the tech and media industries can imagine as effective new products. They are also beginning to put the United States at a disadvantage as compared with nations in Asia and Europe that have invested more. It's a daunting problem with a [long history of both public and private failure](http://www.slate.com/id/2174858/). Unlike, say, building a better dating service, broadband is an infrastructure problem that requires solutions akin to improving roads or plumbing. National infrastructure policy is tough, and, at its worst, Bush's approach has borrowed largely from Emperor Nero. To start fixing things, the next president should immediately announce a national broadband policy with this simple goal: to put the United States back into undisputed leadership in wireless and wire-line broadband. But the question is how, and that's where things get complicated. Proposed fixes abound: pay Verizon, AT&T, or Comcast to build it? Treat the Internet's pipes like the interstate highways, and have the government build them? Use tax credits to encourage consumers to buy their own fiber connections? Sell property rights in spectrum or create a \"mesh\" wireless commons? No one really knows what the best answer is. That's why the next president should appoint a specialized broadband czar to get after the problem. Right now, broadband is no one's responsibility, and the buck keeps getting passed between industry, Congress, the White House, and the FCC. The point of a czar would be to make it someone's job to figure out what it will take to fix broadband. Create the FCC dream team. The next president will have the opportunity to appoint an entirely new Federal Communications Commission. The FCC is the principal American regulator of communications, setting many of the most important rules for information economy. The appointment opportunity shouldn't be wasted\u2014the next president could and should dramatically transform what the FCC can be. Once upon a time, actual experts were appointed to the commission. The first commission, in 1927, was, as historian Philip Rosen writes, \"a remarkable group.\" It included a former admiral who was a naval radio expert, an inspector from the Commerce Department, an engineer and editor from McGraw-Hill, a practicing broadcaster with a Ph.D. in English, and a state Supreme Court judge. Today, none of these people would be considered for the job. Instead of communications expertise, the leading qualifications are now mostly political. Preferred experience includes time logged as a Capitol Hill staffer or in state government; work as a Washington, D.C., telecom attorney and/or lobbyist; some campaign experience; and buy-in from a major industry. Yes, many talented people possess these qualifications, and the FCC has, and continues to have, great leaders. But at some level the approach is like choosing from among Nike's lawyers to find coaches for the U.S. Olympic team. At its worst, it means commissioners show up with \"team loyalty\"\u2014a duty to serve the interests of one of the major industries. And lax restraints on lobbying post-FCC service exacerbates the problem\u2014why make your future boss angry? The next president needs to break this tradition. She or he should search far and wide (yes, even outside of Washington, D.C.) for the wisest tech experts and visionaries to try to create an FCC dream team. The yardstick is the 1927 commission. By 2010, we should ask whether the next administration has managed to at least equal President Coolidge in the quality of its appointments. Fix international tech policy. The president has broad powers to set U.S. international tech policy, and the next president can act to do so quickly. As with the FCC, the president has the chance to staff the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative with some of the best and brightest; he or she should also appoint a worthy successor to \"Internet ambassador\" David Gross in the State Department. The president can also act to reverse a few of the uglier policy practices that have crept in. Here's a leading example: Today, the United States\u2014at the request of the domestic drug industry\u2014continues to sanction poorer nations for trying to make available low-cost medicines for their citizens. For much of the 1990s, the drug industry and the U.S. government insisted that the sale of affordable generic AIDS drugs in African nations would be bad for innovation and global health. Under heavy pressure, the Clinton administration in 1999 swore it wouldn't punish poorer nations that break patents to sell cheap AIDS drugs, and Bush pledged to respect that policy. But as recently as last year, the United States was pressuring Thailand to abandon its efforts to provide cheaper AIDS drugs to its citizens\u2014even though Thailand had followed WTO rules in doing so. U.S. backsliding in this area is indefensible and creates plenty of bad international karma. The next president should declare early on that the United States will no longer put trade pressure on developing countries using WTO-compliant means to make medicine more affordable. The technology of transparent government. One of the great and enduring accomplishments of the Bush administration was that it undermined once and for all the argument that the best decisions are made in secret. Some of Bush's more grotesque mistakes\u2014like the decision to spy on American citizens without warrants\u2014might have been averted by even a tiny amount of transparency. Bush leaves behind a transparency tradition somewhere between Brezhnev and Dracula. A new administration can and should change that\u2014but giving people information about what the government is doing is actually an information-technology problem. To an Internet user, what the government really lacks today is a good search engine or wiki to find out what's going on. The White House, perhaps through a CTO- or CIO-like figure, can find out what the barriers to transparency are, how many are unnecessary, and what can make it easier for citizens to follow their government. Whether that means turning the next White House into a four-year episode of Real World, I leave to the next administration to decide. Long-term solutions Immigration. The insanity of the current U.S. immigration policy hurts not just the conscience but the tech industries as well. Yes, Congress controls immigration levels, but the new president can certainly push for more visas for highly skilled foreign workers. Otherwise, innovation will follow the talent, whether it's in India, Ireland, or Palau. Patents and prizes. The United States patent system drifted into a state of generally recognized insanity in the late 1990s, turning the supposed friend of innovation into a menace. In its darkest days, the U.S. Patent Office and the Federal Circuit Court essentially threw open the patent store and let anyone take what they wanted. Hence the years of ridiculous patents on sandwiches and anti-gravity space vehicles, along with industry-endangering patents used to [force settlements](http://www.slate.com/id/2135559/) out of innovators like RIM and Microsoft. To their credit, the Supreme Court and the Patent Office have in recent years fixed a few of the worst problems, but issues remain. The next president or his surrogate must lean heavily on the Patent Office to take seriously its responsibility as an effective gatekeeper of patent quality. The deeper cure has two parts: The first is pushing for a system that allows opposition to patent applications and other reforms, like the famous \"gold-plated patent\" [proposal](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=869826) championed by Mark Lemley, Douglas The second is starting to rebalance the pro-patent Federal Circuit, arguably among the more activist courts in the nation and the recent target of a Supreme Court crackdown. The president can appoint judges to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals (the patent court) who are both respected experts yet also believe that more patent isn't always better. In addition to patent reform, over the last decade economists have urged limits to the patent as a tool of encouraging invention. [More economists](http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/stiglitz81) think there needs be a greater role for \"innovation prizes\"\u2014prizes for beneficial inventions that, for one reason or another, the commercial patent system doesn't seem to do a good job of encouraging. Examples are renewable-energy technologies or treatments for diseases in developing countries. If we can afford to put a price on the head of Osama Bin Laden, why not one for inventing a malaria vaccine? The next president will inherit a military in strange shambles. Its soldiers fight extremely well, but its army is on the brink of breaking. Its budget is enormous, but most of the money goes to weapons that have little to do with promoting real security. Some official documents detail the problems and outline solutions, but too often they aren't translated into action. The principal task, therefore, is to do just that\u2014in the face of enormous bureaucratic resistance. Overhaul the budget. If you'd awakened from a 20-year-long slumber and glanced at the current defense budget, you'd think the Cold War were still raging. President Bush's [budget request](http://www.slate.com/id/2183592/) for the next fiscal year\u2014totaling $541 billion, not including money for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014is dominated by aircraft carriers, submarines, fighter jets, and ultratech combat fighting vehicles, i.e., the sorts of weapons you'd need to fight the sort of comparably armed superpower that no longer exists. Members of Congress impose no discipline on this extravagance\u2014they scarcely even ask whether all these programs are necessary\u2014for fear of accusations that they're weak on defense or soft on terror. Yet there is a way out of this paralysis. In each of the past few years, Bush has put all the costs of Iraq, Afghanistan, and \"the longer war on terror\" into a separate \" [supplemental](http://www.slate.com/id/2184804/)\" to the budget. The next president should ask the defense secretary to do two things: First, make sure everything in the supplemental really is needed for those wars (tens of billions of dollars' worth don't appear to be); second, announce that everything else is back on the table. There hasn't been a \" [bottom-up review](http://www.fas.org/man/docs/bur/index.html)\" of the defense budget\u2014a systematic look at the requirements of security\u2014since the end of the Cold War. It's time to conduct one, seriously. We don't have the money to stay this course. Rejigger the military services. One obstacle to rational military planning is that, for the past 40 years, by unspoken agreement, the defense budget has been evenly split among the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force. To do otherwise\u2014to announce, for instance, that the Army needs 20 percent more money and the other services could each get by with 10 percent less\u2014would set off a firestorm inside the Pentagon and wreck the interservice cooperation that has marked U.S. military campaigns in recent years. So, over the next several years, certain missions should be played up, others played down. Because the current Air Force is dominated by fighter pilots, the Air Force's No. 1 [priority](http://www.slate.com/id/2184481/) today is to build as many F-22 fighter planes as it can, at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars\u2014even though they would play no role in any foreseeable war over the next two decades. One way to wean them off such weapons is to build up (and put more money into) other Air Force missions\u2014for example, cargo-transport planes (to carry ground forces and their gear), close-air-support planes (to fire shells or drop bombs in support of troops on the ground), or to provide security for bases (many Air Force personnel have been reassigned to do just that). The defense secretary could announce that the service's continued share of the budget depends on boosting the importance of those missions. (This is, bureaucratically, a long-term project.) Fix the Army. The Army is (barely) meeting its recruitment goals by lowering standards and dishing out large [bonuses](http://www.slate.com/id/2177426/). And, despite paying equally large rewards for retention bonuses, it is now hemorrhaging talented junior and midgrade officers. The Iraq war, with its grueling and never-ending deployment schedules, is the main reason for this. (Defense Secretary Robert Gates said recently that Army recruiters face a serious challenge as long as signing up means getting assigned to Iraq.) But Iraq is only part of the problem\u2014and thus getting out of Iraq will provide only a part of the solution. Invest in people. When the draft ended in 1973, the Army chiefs [shifted incentives](http://rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG265/) from veterans' benefits (such as the GI Bill) to enlistment bonuses. This approach has now gone too far, resulting in a \"transactional\" mindset that hurts morale and warps the military's credo of service. The next defense secretary should shift back to the old approach: Fund civilian education for enlisted personnel and officers; provide leave for them to pursue bachelors' and graduate degrees between deployments; give educational grants to family members as compensation for the hardships of repeated moves; invest in immersive training in foreign languages and cultures. These things will produce better officers, as well as happier ones. Promote the right leaders. Owing to a shortage of officers, almost anyone can get promoted to lieutenant colonel. Beyond that, the Army's promotion boards are a hidebound lot\u2014notorious for favoring officers who resemble themselves and for especially screening out intellectuals, mavericks, and strategically minded warriors. (Gen. David Petraeus\u2014who possesses a rare mix of leadership talent, soldierly prowess, intelligence, raw ambition, and luck\u2014is one of a handful of exceptions.) Junior officers read each year's [promotion list](http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=10875) as they would tea leaves; it tells them what types of officers are desired and what types are not. Many creative officers leave the Army after realizing that it holds no future for them. Technically, the president and Congress must approve all promotions. Therefore, either could require that a certain percentage of new brigadier generals possess specific qualities or backgrounds\u2014for instance, that they have trained foreign military forces or proven adept in other skills that will likely be essential in future conflicts. (There is precedent for this: As a result of the [Goldwater-Nichols](http://www.ndu.edu/library/goldnich/goldnich.html) reforms passed by Congress in 1986, all new generals must have experience in a joint\u2014i.e., multiservice\u2014unit.) ) The Army should also consider \"360-degree evaluation\"\u2014i.e., consultation by junior, as well as senior, officers\u2014in order to identify the most talented leaders in its ranks. (Corporate America has long employed this technique.) Create incentives for a real nation-building or counterinsurgency capability. The that \"stability operations\" are just as important as combat. However, these words will ring hollow unless and until more troops are trained in such operations and more officers with expertise in that area are promoted to general. A year ago, a unit was created in Ft. Riley, Kan., home of the 1st Infantry Division, specifically to train advisers\u2014officers who would go advise Iraqi and Afghan security forces. Several Pentagon officials, including Secretary Robert Gates, said that this was one of the Army's most important missions. The commander of the unit was Lt. Col. John Nagl, one of the Army's top experts in counterinsurgency. But Nagl has since complained that the unit was filled on an \"ad hoc\" basis and that many of the trainers had no experience as advisers. He has now [decided](http://www.slate.com/id/2182263/) to leave the Army. We\u2014and, more importantly, other officers\u2014will know that the Pentagon is taking this putative goal seriously when the unit is commanded by a general and when officers who go out in the field as advisers are promoted as routinely as those deployed as infantry fighters. Spread the responsibilities around. Civilian experts are probably better than sergeants at the kinds of stability operations described above. So, the next president should see that more money goes to the State Department, USAID, and other agencies\u2014many of which have nascent offices of stability operations and foreign assistance\u2014and let them do the jobs. Secretary Gates urged this course (even if he didn't volunteer to hand over any of the Pentagon's billions). Some senior Army officers have told us that, for certain urgent tasks in Iraq and Afghanistan, they would rather have 500 more Foreign Service officers than 5,000 more soldiers. If wars\u2014or foreign policies generally\u2014are national campaigns, the burden should be carried by the national government more broadly. Taxes. On that subject, if we're not going to return to military [conscription](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2005/0503.carter.html), more citizens have to contribute something to national defense\u2014if not their blood, then more of their treasure. All the steps outlined above\u2014especially those that involve recruiting and retaining qualified personnel\u2014are very expensive. And they can't all be paid for by canceling the F-22 and other Cold War relics. Nor should they be paid for by borrowing more cash from China. If we want to continue the kind of military we're pursuing, and the kinds of wars we're fighting, then let's pass a surtax to pay for it. If we don't want to pay for it, then let's drop the whole idea\u2014scale back our missions in the world and figure out some other way to fulfill them. The next president must repair our tarnished image in the world and restore some of our lost power. The good news is that, in some respects, the one goal goes along with the other. The bad news is that both are harder than they may seem, because our diminished condition stems not just from President Bush's policies but from our victory in the Cold War, which paradoxically made us weaker. This seems odd at first glance (didn't we emerge as \"the sole superpower\"?), but for all its horrors, the Cold War was a system of international security. The world was dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union, and the countries in between often subordinated their own interests to accommodate\u2014in the West by choice, in the East by force\u2014the interests of their superpower protector. When the USSR evaporated, we didn't step into the vacuum; the vacuum expanded. Old allies realized they could go their own ways and pursue their own interests with less regard for what Washington thought. Other powers\u2014China especially\u2014moved up in the world, offering alternative alignments. Bush accelerated this development by failing to recognize it. He and his top aides thought that since we were now all-powerful, allies were no longer necessary\u2014when, in fact, they were more necessary, and harder to lure, than ever. The next president will have to do what Bush failed to do\u2014step up diplomatic activity, renovate old alliances, devise new ones\u2014not just because diplomacy is preferable to war but because we have no choice. In short, if handled shrewdly, the things the next president must do to repair our image will also enhance our power. Here are some of the main things: Travel to all the Middle East countries and leave behind a full-time envoy to the region. It is appalling that President Bush made his first trip to Israel and the Palestinian territories in his final year and, even then, did nothing\u2014and that he assured the envoy whom he did (finally) appoint that the job was a part-time post. The real agenda at the Annapolis summit, just before then, was to corral the Sunni nations into an anti-Iran coalition. But that won't happen\u2014the leaders won't ally themselves so openly with the United States\u2014until we at least seem to get serious about the Israeli-Palestinian talks. Each of the region's problems has its own dynamic, but each is also linked to the others. Bush has always known this. In 2002-03, he thought that the road to Jerusalem went through Baghdad (i.e., that by toppling Saddam and transforming Iraq into a democracy, the neighboring dictators would fall like dominoes)\u2014when, if anything, the road goes in the opposite direction. Bush's father and Bill Clinton employed Dennis Ross as a full-time Middle East envoy. His job was to douse the flame whenever anyone lit a match and to pounce on any opportunity for a strategic breakthrough. As long as Arafat ruled the PLO, such opportunities were perhaps illusory. Ross or someone like him should go back to do what he used to do\u2014in a more fluid, intriguing setting. Iraq: Use the troops as leverage. Most Democrats realize that total withdrawal in the next few years is impractical. If John McCain is elected, the Joint Chiefs will inform him that his vision of a 100-year occupation is impossible. (If deployments continue at anywhere near current levels, the Army might break before the end of his first term.) The goal should be to withdraw as quickly as possible while trying to keep Iraq from going up in flames. Some believe Iraq's leaders won't get their act together until they see that we really are leaving. Maybe. But it's equally, if not more, plausible that there is no act for them to get together and that the prospect of our departure will drive each faction to retreat and prepare for the imminent civil war. The major parties want us to leave\u2014but not now. One way to exploit this ambivalence: Start the withdrawal but attach benchmarks. (The old benchmarks, which Bush put in place but ignored when they weren't met, might still be suitable.) If the Iraqis meet certain benchmarks, we'll suspend the withdrawal and help consolidate the progress until the next benchmark. If the Iraqis fail to meet them, we will continue the withdrawal. The surge\u2014in fact, our entire military presence\u2014is a means to an end: an instrument to provide security while Iraq's leaders settle their sectarian feuds. If the feuds are irresolvable, we can do only so much; there is little point in keeping our thumbs (and most of our fingers) plugging up holes in the bursting dike. If Iraq were like South Korea or postwar Europe (or even Bosnia), that would be one thing; but no Americans died in combat after those wars were over and the long occupations began. That's not the case with Iraq. Prevent Iraq's internal violence from spreading into neighboring countries. One can imagine Iran intervening to help the Shiites; Saudi Arabia or Egypt or Jordan stepping up to aid the Sunnis; Turkey moving in to crush the Kurds\u2014in short, the civil war morphing into a regionwide conflagration. The next president, working with the United Nations, the Arab League, or whatever entities are suitable, should convene a regional conference. There should be no utopian aspirations. It should be a businesslike office where delegates of the interested nations regularly meet, so that if the violence does begin to spread, there will already be a forum for trying to contain it. This measure would save many days or weeks\u2014which could mean all the difference in the world. In certain neighboring countries ... In 2006, Condoleezza Rice was asked why she wasn't talking with Syria. She replied, \"The Syrians know what they need to do.\" Maybe, but they didn't know what was in it for them if they did\u2014what they would get for walking away from the Iranians and coming over to our side. Spelling out the trade is what diplomacy is about. Maybe there's nothing we can reasonably offer that they'd accept; but there's no harm in trying. Separately, open up talks with Iran with an eye toward negotiating a \"grand bargain.\" These talks should cover all issues\u2014including Western capital investment and the end of sanctions in exchange for concessions on enriching uranium and supporting terrorism. This effort may not go anywhere. But Bush's hostile rhetoric has only bolstered Ahmadinejad's domestic support. Diplomatic overtures, if made openly and (by all appearances) sincerely, may undermine his resistance to reform. Work toward new Pakistani alliances. In Pakistan, the situation is so fluid and uncertain, it's hard to know at this point what policies ought to be pursued 10 months from now. But backing away from Musharraf and moving toward whatever coalition of parties the Pakistani people support (as long as the Taliban or al-Qaida aren't involved) would be a smart move. In these kinds of situations, it's wise to invoke the Realist's slogan: Nations have interests, not friends. (In this case, our hardheaded security interests and our moral aspirations\u2014to create conditions for the survival and, if possible, the spread of democracy\u2014coincide.) Pursue public diplomacy. What we do sends a more potent signal to the world than the cleverest PR campaign. But once we start doing smarter things, we should also be smart about promoting our efforts. For instance: Revive the U.S. Information Agency\u2014a once-vast independent entity that (though lecture programs, libraries, concerts, etc.) promoted not American policy but American values. Send as emissaries abroad people who understand the language and the area (not well-meaning provincials like Karen Hughes). Expand the Foreign Service. Offer scholarships for intense study in crucial languages. Train customs officers to treat foreign visitors more courteously at embassies and airports. It should be possible to be vigilant about security without assuming that every tourist is a terrorist. It can be a little wisp of fabric, nothing more. It comes in longer versions, shorter versions, versions that cover the hair, others that cover the face. According to [Le Monde](http://www.lemonde.fr/web/recherche_breve/1,13-0,37-1001672,0.html), you can even get a Viennese stylist to design one in the manner of \"Catherine Zeta-Jones or Naomi Campbell,\" with a whiff of supermodel glamour. But whatever shape it takes, and whatever you want to call it, the political controversy surrounding the scarves that many (though not all) Islamic women use to cover their heads will not go away. The debate surrounding head scarves, banned in French schools and some German state institutions, has just re-emerged at the center of an extraordinary lawsuit, one that could, if successful, bring down the Turkish government. Brought by the chief prosecutor of Turkey, [the suit](http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/english/turkey/8585399.asp?gid=231&sz=98946)\u2014to put it bluntly and briefly\u2014accuses the ruling party of violating Turkey's Constitution, and it proposes to evict its leaders, including the prime minister and the president, from politics. The central point of this sticky legal clash between the \"secularism\" of the Turkish Constitution and the \"will of the nation,\" as the ruling party calls it (or the \"dictatorship of the majority,\" in the words of Turkey's chief prosecutor), is [the head scarf](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7321964.stm): Last February, the government lifted a long-standing ban on the wearing of them at universities, and Turkey's secular classes are furious. This kind of controversy is not entirely new to Turkey, where political parties have been banned in the past (and prime ministers hanged in the more distant past) for insufficient secularism. What strikes me as important this time around is the enduring significance, once again, of that simple piece of cloth. To outsiders, the issue usually seems petty. (The International Herald Tribune titled its editorial on the subject \" [Much Ado About Head Scarves](http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/19/opinion/edscarves.php).\") Those with an Anglo-American bias\u2014myself included\u2014have often been persuaded that the issue is one of personal liberty: A head scarf should be a matter of \"choice.\" But if politicians are grandstanding about head scarves, maybe that's because head scarves, at least in Turkey and a few other places, are political symbols and not purely religious \"choices\" at all. Fairly or not, in certain Turkish communities, a head covering in fact marks the wearer not just as faithful but as a believer in a particular version of Islam. Fairly or not, the head scarf carries with it, at least in Turkey, partisan connotations, as well as a suggestion of the wearer's views of women. Political scientist Zeyno Baran [pointed out](http://www.hudson.org/learn/index.cfm?fuseaction=staff_bio&eid=BaranZeyno) to me that most of the wives of the current Turkish political leadership wear head scarves, that most of them donned the scarves after their marriages, and that most of them never worked or studied again after they wed. You can see why women who want something different might feel threatened. In fact, the Turkish ban was first instituted in the 1980s precisely to protect these bareheaded women, as well as the secular students who wanted to remain so. For 20 years or so, the ban was relatively successful. After a few initial protests, it was widely accepted\u2014how else can a deeply divided society survive, unless it creates zones of neutrality?\u2014at least until the current government tried to get rid of it again this year. For the record, the French head-scarf ban\u2014though widely mocked when instituted in 2004\u2014is at the moment considered a great success, at least by the French government. Droves of girls did not drop out of school, as predicted. Every year, French officials say, there are fewer conflicts over the issue. Over time, they argue, Muslim girls will find it easier to integrate into French society. None of which is to say that Turkey's supreme court can or should oust the Turkish government: I'll let Turkey's lawyers fight that one out. But if they try to do so, let's not pretend it's unimportant. And if, someday, this argument comes to our shores, let's not be surprised by that. In the end, the head-scarf debate isn't about a wisp of fabric but about the viability of secular Islam itself. Click [here](#Cultural) for the most recent Cultural Gabfest.

Emily Bazelon, John Dickerson, and David Plotz gather in Slate's Washington, D.C, studio to discuss the impact of New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer's resignation, how Geraldine Ferraro's comments can help or hurt each Democratic candidate's campaign, and the ongoing murmurs about a Clinton-Obama dream ticket. Eliot Spitzer's involvement with a prostitute and subsequent resignation dominated the discussion. Of particular note, the Gabfest team explored the possibility that Spitzer [did not pay enough](http://www.slate.com/id/2186491/). They discussed a post on \"The XX Factor\" that argues that finding sex [may not be easier for powerful men](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/xxfactor/archive/2008/03/12/bill-clinton-didn-t-pay-for-sex-jim-mcgreevey-didn-t-pay-for-sex.aspx).

Emily conceded that Ferraro's comments [held some truth](http://www.slate.com/id/2186324/), although her phrasing was deeply flawed. Finally, the Gabfest panelists doubted the possibility of a dream ticket between the two major Democratic candidates. Emily was particularly taken with Clinton's recent ads, which, she believes, have successfully planted the seed in voters' minds that Obama is the \" [unready](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/03/17/080317fa_fact_lizza)\" candidate.

(E-mail may be quoted by name unless the writer stipulates otherwise.) Posted by June Thomas at 6:16 p.m. Ah, there's nothing like spring with your child joining you in the garden. Little hands at work in the sweet, crumbly soil to create a wee enchanted fairyland. Phooey! (Or a stronger expletive.) Tending a garden is not trivial work. To do any kind of gardening is to balance disorder and order, chaos and control. To be a parent is to deal with the same forces. Certainly, children can get a lot of pleasure from growing flowers and vegetables. But let go of the sweet fantasy of the toddler tending the bean from seed to stalk or the kindergartner struck dumb with wonder as you explain evolution, photosynthesis, and genetically modified organisms. The adult's dream of a flowery haven full of teaching opportunities quickly comes into conflict with the child's natural energy and need to act on things, not just look at them. Here are some suggestions for how to decrease conflict and increase your and your young charge's chances of success. The desired outcome in this arena consists of plants that stay alive and no child or parent actually weeping or throwing things. ~ Don't wait until July. It will be too hot to plant, and there will be slim pickings at the nursery. ~ Be flexible. The act of gardening, with its necessary adjustments to weather and terrain and plagues and pests, forcefully promotes flexibility. Now, you're interacting with a small human being with a short attention span as well as with the larger forces of nature. Bend a bit in matters of taste. While you're imagining an all-white garden, your child will be picking out the orange marigold that goes badly with every other color, especially his or her next selection, the red petunia with white stripes that resembles nothing in nature. ~ Start small. Many an adult tells of being turned off gardening for life by being given the chore of weeding a parent's half-acre. Your child can grow a surprising amount of interesting stuff in a half-barrel in the sun. Take care to put drainage holes in the bottom and fill it with a lightweight sterile soil mix rather than yard dirt. Mix in slow-release fertilizer pellets. String twine up a wall onto hooks. Have your child plant seeds of a vine like morning glory or small gourds or scarlet runner bean. Go to a farmers market or nursery and let him or her pick out a trailing annual like petunias or verbena for the barrel's edge and some spearmint for an area that will be shaded. Water with a watering can, not a hose, gently and thoroughly. (More later on the dire consequences of child plus hose.) You could stick with the half-barrel or go bigger by preparing a sunny 4-by-6-foot spot. Surround this small patch with boards to define it. Put a narrow board across it, so your child can reach the plants without stepping on them or the soil. Improve the soil before you plant. In a city, this means a well-gloved adult will remove glass, cans, bottle caps, cigarettes, rocks, and lumps of concrete. Spread compost or well-rotted manure on the soil and dig it in lightly. Save the big rocks. Your child can use them to outline the planted bed so the plot won't get stepped on. To see why it's important to be clear about where not to walk, picture an outdoor birthday party for a dozen 4-year-olds. Pavers are great\u2014kids can hopscotch along them. Raised beds for vegetables and precious plants are even better for keeping plants out of harm's way. ~ Select structures that work for both adults and children. With a small yard, you have to decide whether you want a playground or a garden. A playground, unless it involves a swimming pool, gets old fast. The abandoned jungle gym and the rusted swing set are clich\u00e9s for a desolate place; leave play structures to park planners. Instead, make a big, sturdy bench\u2014it could be no more than firmly planted cinder blocks and a thick, wide board. A child can jump on and off it and, when exhausted, sit and rest beside you. Any kind of platform, as small as a bench or as big as a deck, works as a lookout, a stage, an island, or a fort. ~ Let the child make a mess, but not everywhere. If you take a minute to watch a child enter a yard, you'll see him sizing up the place for somewhere to climb, somewhere to dig, and somewhere to hide. Give your kid and a friend some trowels and a well-defined place where you want the soil loosened up. When putting shrubs beside a shed or garage, plant those hydrangeas or viburnums 4 feet away from the structure, leaving room for a hiding place. Spread pine-bark nuggets underfoot to cut down on mud; the bark will smell good when it warms up. ~ Choose plants that will give you a relatively fast payoff. There are some seeds that can go right into the ground in that 4-by-6-foot space. The whole plot could be sunflowers from seed. Food plants that work well from seeds sown directly outdoors include beans, peas, carrots, radishes, and summer squash. If you combine sunflowers with food, place the sunflowers where they won't shade everything else. For plants like tomatoes, buy seedlings. (There are very few home windowsills sunny enough to grow healthy tomato seedlings indoors.) A surprisingly cool plant for children is Brussels sprouts. A 3-inch seedling grows a stupendously strong and thick trunk by harvest time. The sprouts are fantastic plucked when they're the size of a baby fingernail. Should you grow a squash like [zucchetta trombolina](http://www.oztion.com.au/vshops/item.aspx?itemid=3632599) (one of the selections in the John Scheepers [seed collection](http://www.kitchengardenseeds.com/cgi-bin/catview.cgi?_fn=Specials) \"A Child's Garden of Wonder\"), harvest those green submarines when they're small, or you will be overwhelmed. Prickly squash leaves can irritate skin, not enough to hurt but enough to provide a lesson in how plants protect themselves from browsing animals. Also look for plants that are very pleasant to touch. Many of the scented geraniums have leaves that are both velvety and fragrant. Lamb's ears really are gray and fuzzy, and easy to grow in well-drained soil. For a child's cutting garden, cosmos and black-eyed Susans provide the classic grandmother-pleasing daisy shape. You will want to demonstrate to your youngster that when you pull on a flower stem, you often pull up the whole plant. Trust your child with small scissors with rounded ends. Children are supposed to like plants that are pretty, but they really, truly like plants that are weird, even monstrous. One very easy monster perennial is [joe pye weed](http://www.dnr.mo.gov/greenbldg/wildflowers/joe-pye-weed.htm), which can get to be 6 feet tall, with meadowy pink flowers that are attractive to butterflies. The tropical plants commonly known as elephant ears are weirdly beautiful. One of them, esculenta [black magic](http://www.mobot.org/gardeninghelp/plantfinder/Plant.asp?code=Z800) has huge leaves that emerge green and turn to purply-black. Another, Alocasia amazonica, has dark-green leaves with dramatic white veins, in the shape of an African mask. There's an easy rose bush, [Rosa chinensis mutabilis](http://www.californiagardens.com/Plant_Pages/Roses/rosa_mutabilis.htm), with orange buds that open to yellow, orange, pink, and pinkish-red. Combine it with the buddleia that has orange-pink and purple all on the same flower. ~ Supervise watering. (Imagine that birthday party if one of the 4-year-olds gets a hold of a hose.) Watering is both the most important thing for keeping plants alive and the biggest danger in gardening with children, power saws aside. A blast of water tears or uproots small plants, washes away soil, and splatters leaves with mud. It isn't easy to get across the concept of watering slowly and thoroughly, letting the water sink in. This is why God created watering cans. An adult or some calm, sane child should use the hose to fill the watering can. You then have a very pretty camera-ready tableau. Because your child will probably get bored after the second watering can, the adult in the garden needs to use a hose (with a soaker nozzle) to water the garden the next morning. ~ Finally, teach by example more than by explaining. If an adult is working in a concentrated, calm, meditative manner, it is a very good bet that a child will interrupt. With luck, the interruption will come with the question What are you doing and why? The last but most important step: Take a look together every day at what's growing. *** Some inspired advice: \"Recognize that kids' gardening priorities are different, well, practically opposite of adults'.\" That comes from Cheryl Dorschner, a columnist at the Burlington Free Press. Here's a [particularly good Web site](http://www.kidsgardening.com/family.asp) for more information. [Yee]()-haw: NBC promised year-round fun at its \"in-fronts,\" held Wednesday afternoon. The network doesn't have many new hits to tout, so it's trying to lure advertisers with an ambitious plan: original shows 12 months a year. And instead of waiting until May to present its plans at the upfronts, NBC is tossing a lot at the wall right now. Here's a little dish on the fates of what may be your favorite shows: The Office will be paired with a spinoff, but NBC is not telling anything about it\u2014except that it's supposed to launch after the Super Bowl. Interest in the original show is such that \"all our Office scripts are watermarked,\" Ben Silverman, the co-chairman of NBC, said. \"We're only going to bring [the spinoff] to market if it's ready for market and up to the quality of the original.\" He also noted that unlike competitors' comedies, NBC's are funny. \"I've watched the other shows on other networks. I've never laughed,\" he said. Chuck will be back on Monday nights. Life will hang in there by a strand on Friday nights. Friday Night Lights will be back in February\u2014though the show struggles in the ratings, it has a passionate following. NBC is keeping it by agreeing to air the series after it runs via DirecTV. NBC will also schedule series that have previously aired in Canada or on the BBC. Why not? It's worth a try. Bionic Woman and Journeyman are dead. E.R. has one season left, with a finale in late February. As for new shows, Silverman has heavily hyped My Own Worst Enemy, the new Jekyll-and-Hyde show with Christian Slater. We had no idea Slater was this hot, but Silverman repeatedly compared casting him to earlier snarings of Steve Carell for The Office and America Ferrera for Ugly Betty. They chased Slater to London and Spokane! Once the network got him, it skipped the pilot and went straight to series. Silverman cautioned that the schedule remains fluid, invoking\u2014and mixing\u2014sports metaphors: \"We're constantly playing a three-dimensional chess game. ...We obviously are going to need to be able to call audibles.\" ( [link](#NBC)) March 28, 2008 Order in the [court](): Your Hollywoodland correspondent decided to take a firsthand look at the Pellicano trial on Thursday, arriving in the midst of seemingly endless testimony about how phone companies work. Even Pellicano\u2014balding, wearing unfashionable glasses and his prison-issue, olive-drab windbreaker\u2014yawned as he watched the endless cross-examination. Seated along the defendant's row with Pellicano were accused co-conspirators from the phone company and the police department. The courtroom, with its high vaulted ceiling and rows of recessed lights, felt like a weird converted airplane hangar. There was momentary hope that things might perk up when the phone company guy got off the stand and Freddie DeMann, former partner with Madonna in Maverick Records, stepped up. He testified about shelling out $135,000 for Pellicano to snoop on his son-in-law to establish whether he was cheating on DeMann's daughter. He admitted to listening to revealing taped phone conversations involving that son-in-law. The testimony was awkward but not devastating. One fact seemed worth noting: Others who admitted on the stand that they had listened to tapes that were allegedly made illegally have testified under a grant of immunity. But there was no mention of immunity during DeMann's testimony, and yet he hasn't been charged with anything. Pellicano did not question him. The attorney representing ex-cop Mark Arneson tried to ask DeMann if he didn't think his daughter was better off after Dad got the dirt on her husband. The relevance of that as a legal defense was obscure; the judge sustained an objection, so DeMann didn't answer. More pathetic was former phone company employee Teresa Wright, who wept copiously while she admitted that she conducted \"hundreds\" of unauthorized searches at the behest of Rayford Turner, an old friend and colleague who was sitting there in court down the row from Pellicano. She acknowledged tearfully that she, too, is awaiting sentencing. This week's biggest drama involved an announcement in court on Tuesday that lawyer Bert Fields was planning to take the Fifth if called to testify. (Recall that Fields is the lawyer who hired Pellicano on behalf of many clients over many years, including Brad Grey and Michael Ovitz.) Fields promptly denied that and said he'd testify if called. The U.S. attorney's office then issued a statement explaining the confusion this way: Fields' personal lawyer, John Keker, had advised that Fields would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights but then the counsel for Fields' law firm said it wasn't so. And Keker was, mysteriously, out as Fields' lawyer. What does it mean? We consulted former prosecutor Laurie Levinson, who's not following the trial day-to-day but knows how these things work. She says it's possible that Keker reflexively wanted Fields to take the Fifth, as any criminal-defense attorney might, and then found out that his client disagreed with that plan. Or it's possible that Fields knew of the plan but didn't like the reaction after it was made public. Or perhaps his firm didn't like the reaction. It could be that Keker thought his client should take the Fifth and wasn't comfortable with hanging around if that didn't happen. Keker's reputation is so good, she says, that most people would give him the benefit of any doubt in any rift with Fields. Of course, Keker can't talk about what happened because it's privileged. As to whether the prosecutors will call Fields, she was doubtful. Fields is not the prosecution's friend in this matter, she says, and calling him would represent unknown and unnecessary risk. Just another disappointment in what was once supposed to be the trial of all Hollywood trials. ( [link](#Order)) March 21, 2008 Sordid [details](): As expected, Paramount chief Brad Grey's testimony at the Pellicano trial was not too sexy. Garry Shandling may have gotten people's hopes up with his complaints about Grey's behavior as his manager, but no one in this case has a stake in pursuing that angle. The question was whether Grey knew of Pellicano's alleged wrongdoing, and Grey, naturally, said he did not. So it's hardly surprising that Shandling\u2014a professional, after all\u2014turned out to be more entertaining than Grey. For those looking for a big takedown of Hollywood power, it's long been clear that the trial seems unlikely to pay off. But the fact that Pellicano's big-name clients appear to have skated doesn't mean that the allegations in this case aren't sensational. They could hardly be more so. If the government's got its facts right (and Pellicano, acting as his own counsel, isn't mounting a serious defense so far), then the worst is true: Justice in this country can be bought pretty easily, if not cheaply. The case has elicited testimony that Pellicano convinced cops and phone company employees to snoop through data that should have had vigilant protection. He perverted the system, and not just to benefit rich clients who wanted to shake off unwanted spouses or thwart opponents in business deals. He is accused of having successfully intimidated a number of alleged rape victims to prevent their testifying against a client. Got that? It would mean that he helped an alleged serial rapist get off the hook. And he got away with it all for years. For a long time, Pellicano's tough-guy talk seemed to put him on the verge of self-parody: the hard-boiled gumshoe playing the private-dick role in the manner that people in Hollywood would expect. And in many cases, his alleged victims were hard to pity\u2014like producer Bo Zenga, who had to take the Fifth more than 100 times when he was deposed in a lawsuit that he had initiated. (Zenga has also declared himself an award-winning screenwriter when all he had \"won\" was a contest that he'd made up himself.) Then there was Lisa Bonder, who tried to shake down Kirk Kerkorian for $320,000 a month after gaming a DNA test to trick him into supporting a child who wasn't his. It was hard to feel bad when Pellicano exposed that type of behavior. But even if all of Pellicano's victims had put themselves in harm's way, what he appears to have done goes far beyond their concerns. Every day of testimony sharpens the focus on allegations that should scare everyone\u2014even folks who have never gotten closer to Hollywood than the multiplex.

Gloria Allred, who represents victims of [harassment, discrimination, and wrongful termination](http://www.amglaw.com/CM/Custom/TOCPracticeAreaDescriptions.asp), is \"the most famous woman attorney practicing law in the nation today,\" according to her own [Web site](http://www.gloriaallred.com/CM/Custom/Home.asp). That immodest judgment would be hard to dispute. In her storied career, Allred has filed an amicus brief in [Paula Corbin Jones William [mistress](http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1210445,00.html), recently, taken on [Heather Mills](http://icydk.com/?s=heather+mills+gloria+allred) as a client after the activist/fashion model divorced Paul McCartney. At a packed [press conference](http://www.gloriaallred.com/CM/Media/Hamlin.wmv) last week, Allred announced her latest cause: the alleged harassment of a graphic artist named Mandi Hamlin by officials of the Transportation Security Administration at the [Lubbock, Texas](http://www.flylia.com/Old%20Website%20Pages/Airport.htm) airport. At issue is whether the TSA followed a humane protocol for women who wear nipple rings. In a letter (see below and on the following two pages) Allred describes the February [incident](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/03/tsa-defends-nip.html). Hamlin, Allred writes, was nearly barred from a [Southwest Airlines](http://southwest.com/swamedia/cities/swamedia_lbb.html) flight to Dallas because of her numerous [metal piercings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_piercing). When the hand-held metal detector beeped near Hamlin's \"left breast\" (below), Hamlin offered to confirm that her nipple rings did not constitute a deadly weapon by showing them to a female TSA agent. Instead, Hamlin was led behind a \"dark curtain\" where she was forced to remove them with \"the help of pliers\" while \"a growing number of predominantly-male TSA officers\" could be heard \"snickering in the background\" (Page 3). This was, Allred argues, not only cruel but also at odds with the TSA's own policy, which states that a \"pat-down inspection\" is sufficient and leaves the question of whether to remove the body piercing as an alternative to a pat-down entirely in the hands of the airline passenger. At the press conference, Allred demonstrated the painful and humiliating procedure using a [mannequin and a brassiere](http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/world/passenger-removes-nipple-ring-with-pliers/2008/03/28/1206207352355.html) (see [video](http://www.tmz.com/2008/03/27/allred-goes-tit-for-tat-with-the-tsa/)), then demanded that the Department of Homeland Security make \"a public apology.\" TSA, for its part, says it [appreciates](http://www.tsa.gov/press/happenings/lubbock.shtm) Hamlin's \"raising awareness on this issue\" and sincerely \"regrets the situation in which she found herself.\" The agency says it is \"changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again.\" Send ideas for Hot Document to [documents@slate.com](mailto:documents@slate.com).

At criminal trials in U.S. federal courts, documents filed by prosecutors and defendants are typically readily available to the public through a court-records [information system](http://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/uspci.html).

The federal trial of Hollywood private investigator [Anthony Pellicano](http://www.latimes.com/news/la-pellicano-sg,1,6702911.storygallery), under way in Los Angeles, also involves wiretaps, but those records have not been particularly accessible. Pellicano is accused of putting police department employees on his payroll and of crimes related to an enterprise that paired wiretapping technology with moonlighting telephone company employees. Hollywood attorneys hiring Pellicano used illegally overheard phone calls or pilfered police records to gain the upper hand in their [celebrity](http://www.slate.com/id/2138946/) clients' legal disputes.

A few weeks ago, I wrote about the transformation of [sex selection](http://www.slate.com/id/2185090/)\u2014the practice of making sure your next baby isn't of the \"wrong\" sex\u2014into a consumer protection issue. We're getting sufficiently used to this practice that we've begun to talk and write about whether companies that promote and facilitate it are delivering on their promises, rather than about whether what they're doing is wrong. One key point from that article was that the new transforms the old. What's old is sex selection. What's new is the combination of ease, safety, and privacy with which you can now do it. This is a fundamental dynamic between technology and culture: Technology can coax cultures one way or the other by making it easier to do what you want to do, with less difficulty and without other people knowing about it. Now comes further evidence of this effect. Two days ago, economists Douglas Almond and Lena Edlund published an article in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences examining the ratio of [male to female births](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0800703105v1) in \"U.S.-born children of Chinese, Korean, and Asian Indian parents.\" Among whites, the boy-girl ratio was essentially constant, regardless of the number of kids in a family or how many of them were girls. In the Asian-American sample, the boy-girl ratio started out at the same norm: 1.05 to 1. But among families whose first child was a girl, the boy-girl ratio among second kids went up to 1.17 to 1. And if the first two kids were girls, the boy-girl ratio among third kids went up to 1.5 to 1. This 50 percent increase in male probability is directly contrary to the trend among whites, who tend to produce a child of the same sex as the previous child. There's no plausible innocent explanation for this enormous and directionally abnormal shift in probability. The authors conclude that the numbers are \"evidence of sex selection, most likely at the prenatal stage.\" Sex selection of this magnitude has previously been documented in China, South Korea, and India, but not in the United States. Here, the authors note, the usual economic and political rationales for sex selection\u2014dowries, \"patrilocal\" marriage, China's one-child policy, and dependence on your kids' support in old age\u2014don't apply. From this absence of practical motive, some experts conclude that the study shows persistence of a cultural tradition as the populations in question migrated to the United States. But traditions can fade, and this one \"is [unlikely to persist in subsequent generations](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=4561037),\" one demographer told the Associated Press. If you look at sex selection as a cultural phenomenon, that may be true. But if you look at it as a technology, the opposite is just as plausible. The spread of fetal or embryonic sex-identification tests, which can be taken in the privacy of your home at increasingly early stages of pregnancy, makes it easier for sex selection to spread beyond its original cultural base. So does the emergence of [pre-implantation genetic diagnosis](http://www.slate.com/id/2149772/), which lets you chuck your conceived offspring before pregnancy even begins. In fact, the 2000 census data reviewed by Almond and Edlund suggest that within the base population, selection of male fetuses has indeed increased. \"The male bias we find in the U.S. appears to be recent,\" they [write](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/abstract/0800703105v1). \"In the 1990 U.S. Census, the tendency for males to follow females among Indians, Chinese, and Koreans is substantially muted.\" The most obvious factor is technology. Referring to data from the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics, the authors [observe](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=4561037), \"Between 1989 and 1999, prenatal ultrasound use among non-Japanese Asian mothers rose from around 38 percent to 64 percent of pregnancies.\" They add: \"Since 2005, sexing through a blood test as early as 5 weeks after conception has been marketed directly to consumers in the U.S., raising the prospect of sex selection becoming more widely practiced in the near future.\" If you think of yourself as a techno-progressive\u2014someone who believes, as Barack Obama does, that \" [maximizing the power of technology](http://www.barackobama.com/issues/technology/#solve-problems)\" will help fix everything from [energy](http://www.barackobama.com/issues/energy/) to the [environment](http://www.barackobama.com/issues/energy/#invest-in-a-clean) to [health care](http://www.barackobama.com/issues/healthcare/)\u2014the increase in sex selection should give you pause. Technology can facilitate regression as easily as it facilitates progress. But if you think of yourself as a pro-life conservative, the data should humble you, too. In the populations in which it has increased, sex selection isn't a newfangled perversion. It's a custom, and a patriarchal one at that. If the sex-selection story teaches us all to be a bit more skeptical of both tradition and technology, that'll be real progress. Pop quiz for the law junkies: 1) Name the lawyer in the Bush administration who was sanctioned, sacked, or prosecuted for anything related to the firing of nine U.S. attorneys last spring. 2) How about the attorney fired for allowing the destruction of thousands of White House e-mails or the CIA torture tapes? 3) The guy dismissed after advocating for warrantless wiretapping in violation of the FISA law? 4) Disciplined for gross civil rights violations through the misuse of National Security Letters? Can't think of anyone? Me neither. Someday, when we look back at the Bush administration's \"war on terror,\" we'll be unable to point to the \"bad guys\" because they will turn out to be a bunch of attorneys in starched white button-downs, using plausible-sounding legal analysis to beat precedent and statute and treatise from ploughshares into swords. And not one of them will be held to account. From torture to warrantless spying to the creation of a lawless prison at Guantanamo Bay, this has been a \"war\" waged by a thousand memos. And with the release last night of the long-awaited [John Yoo \"torture memo](http://www.slate.com/id/2187979/entry/2187980/)\"\u201481 pages of half-supported Bush administration wish fulfillment\u2014we have an official poster boy for the lawyerly claim of someone who was \"just doing his job.\" This morning, my inbox runneth over with e-mails from folks wondering [what will happen](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barry-yourgrau/why-is-torture-lawyer-jo_b_94630.html) to the memo's author, a man who so blithely argued that, in effect, if the president authorizes it, it isn't illegal. What's going to happen to John Yoo is pretty much what has happened to every other lawyer who ever offered a plausible-sounding legal opinion about how to break the laws in pursuing the war on terror. Nothing. He was just doing his job. The worst thing that will happen to Yoo may be that he has to teach the dreaded 8:30 a.m. Friday class at Berkeley next year. It's the lawyers who wrote the \"no\" memos who lost their jobs. In his book [The Terror Presidency](http://www.amazon.com/Terror-Presidency-Judgment-Inside-Administration/dp/0393065502), my friend Jack Goldsmith\u2014who prescribes some fixes for the legal war on terror [elsewhere in Slate today](http://www.slate.com/id/2187870/)\u2014depicts the paralyzing effect of something called \"lawfare.\" Lawfare was described by Air Force Brig. Gen. Charles Dunlap as \"the strategy of using or misusing law as a substitute for traditional military means to achieve an operational objective.\" Ordinary acts of foreign policy become bogged down in a maze of after-the-fact legal consequences. Donald Rumsfeld saw this form of warfare as a limit on American military authority. He was determined to find a solution to what he called \"the judicialization of international politics.\" Goldsmith argues that when government actors are hemmed in on all sides by domestic and international laws, they become immobilized and fearful. As he notes, \"It is unimaginable that Francis Biddle or Robert Jackson would have written Franklin Roosevelt a memorandum about how to avoid prosecution for his wartime decisions designed to maintain flexibility against a new and deadly foe.\" It was the accumulation of all these new laws and courts and lawyers that contributed to an inability for anyone in the Bush administration to act quickly and forcefully to prevent the next attack after 9/11. According to Goldsmith, the war had been \"lawyered to death,\" and hoards of executive-branch officials were afraid to act aggressively in fighting the next terror attack because they were terrified of the legal consequences of doing so. Thus, high-ranked government officials milled around on the sidelines waiting to be green-lighted by some attorney, in much the same way onlookers at a car crash are afraid to move the body. It sounds awful, and it's almost possible to see John Yoo as the brave individual willing to green-light aggressive interrogation amid all that paralysis. But in hindsight, Yoo has proven himself to be a one-man argument for the wisdom of \"lawfare.\" Those same forces that constrain the executive from acting boldly in a crisis may also keep it from behaving in ways that later shock the conscience. If it's a choice between sober legal reflection and unhinged prisoner abuse, sober reflection also has its advantages. But that choice also assumes lawyers engaged in sober reflection, and that may be assuming too much. Indeed, if anything, Goldsmith and others may have understated the dangers of \"lawfare\"\u2014if the lawyers tasked with working around the web of international laws begin from the premise that laws are just obstacles. As we are beginning to learn, the growing tendency to conduct wars in the courtroom hasn't actually constrained anyone at all over the past seven years. The expanded role of all these laws and lawyers in the war on terror has had the opposite effect: The Bush administration has proven time and again that the Rule of Law is only as definitive as its most inventive lawyers. In short, the Bush solution to the paralysis of lawfare seems to be to hire lawyers who don't believe in the law. And the newly revealed Yoo memo highlights several reasons why warfare by midlevel legal memoranda is a terrible mistake: 1) The dangerous presumption that there are two legitimate sides to every question, including settled ones: This is a peculiar hallmark of Bush administration's existentialist thinking. Witness Michael Mukasey, whose ability to turn settled legal questions (\"water-boarding = torture\") into exercises in 1st Officer Spockian Deep Thought (\"water-boarding might be torture. Or it might not. Fascinating problem. Hmmm\"). The Yoo memo is what [Orin Kerr rightly characterizes](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/convictions/archive/2008/04/02/john-yoo-s-living-constitutionalism.aspx) as \"lawyerly.\" It looks like a memo. Notes Kerr, \"It cites tons of authority, hedges arguments, discusses counterarguments, and generally reads like a careful lawyer's work.\" That's because in law school, they teach you to take out the bits that say, \"Stick 'em in the eye with the shrimp fork!\" But as Kerr also concedes, you can be lawyerly and also poorly reasoned. There are good arguments to be made for many stupid legal ideas, but that doesn't make them legal. We need to stop revering open-mindedness when it comes to settled law. It suggests that contrarian, dangerous, bad ideas have equal weight to settled, prudent, careful ideas, so long as there are citations and footnotes to support them. 2) The diffusion of legal responsibility and plausible deniability: [Marty Lederman asks important questions](http://balkin.blogspot.com/2008/04/full-employment-memo-for-bloggers-and.html) about how a midlevel lawyer managed to cook up some law in his constitutional Easy-Bake Oven that somehow became America's interrogation policy and a how-to for interrogators at Abu Ghraib. Part of that answer lies in the difference between what lawyers do\u2014suggest permissible legal pathways\u2014and what advisers do\u2014suggest the wisest pathways. This is the difference, as Philip Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission has put it, between deciding \"what we can do\" and \"what we should do.\" Whether Yoo really should be held responsible for writing a shockingly bad memo about what we can do during interrogations is not even the interesting question. How that memo then morphed into what we should do is the important half. With Yoo's legal \"analysis\" in hand, and the accountability for it diffused among many government officials, the system of legal memos promises to give cover to everyone at the top. As [Rosa Brooks so wonderfully put it](http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-brooks13dec13,0,5440683.column?coll=la-opinion-columnists) in the Los Angeles Times, it takes a village to adopt a torture policy. But accountability should not evaporate just because a lawyer wrote a memo at the start of the chain. 3) Lawyers cannot predict the future: The problem with letting lawyers set policy is that they cannot always anticipate real-world consequences. To be fair, Yoo couldn't have known that his legal worldview would become the blueprint for torture. But legal decisions have real-world consequences; they aren't just value-neutral thought experiments. And as a [stunning new piece in Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2008/05/guantanamo200805) by Philippe Sands on the evolution of the Bush torture policy reminds us, when the White House\u2014in the persons of Alberto Gonzales and Jim Haynes\u2014tried to distance themselves from the 2002 Bybee-Yoo memo, they did so by characterizing it as so much harmless legal spitballing, merely exploring \"the limits of the legal landscape.\" Opponents of lawfare worry that snap decisions made by politicians in a crisis will be judged by lawyers in the unforgiving light of hindsight. But the Yoo memo drives home the dangers of the opposite phenomenon: Unsupportable decisions by reckless lawyers can be disavowed by politicians claiming that, hey, it was just an abstract legal memo. A lot of folks are inclined to [write off the news](http://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/04/7843_yoo_memo_releas.html) of the torture memo today because: (i) we already knew this; (ii) it's no longer the law; and (iii) David Addington won't be allowed to listen in on their phone calls in seven months. I respectfully dissent. We should be thinking long and hard about how this memo came to be our interrogation policy, even for a few months. Now is the time to question the wisdom of trusting the policing of the boundaries in the war on terror to a swarm of anonymous midlevel lawyers whose minds may just be too open for our own good. We need to get away from the wrongheaded notion that a war on terror is the same thing as a war against the law. When it comes to the question of race in America, Barack Obama is used to hot tempers, accusations of bias, protests, speeches, and outrage. In 1990, Harvard Law School was a battleground in the identity wars: The faculty was angrily split over minority hiring and how to teach race in the classroom. Two years earlier, 50 students had occupied the dean's office, demanding a more diverse faculty; and that spring, Derrick Bell\u2014the first African-American to get tenure at Harvard Law School\u2014resigned over the issue. Similar tensions roiled the Harvard Law Review. The students were up in arms over\u2014among other things\u2014the role of race and gender in the selection of editors. \"That year was unusual in that there was a group of very assertive conservative types on the Law Review,\" says Adam Charnes, who counted himself among them. Obama, who had earned a place on the journal in his first year at Harvard, saw a role for himself that has come to define his pitch for the presidency today\u2014as a bridge builder. He approached the conservatives, according to another member of that contingent who has requested anonymity, and explained that while he supported affirmative action as a policy matter, he recognized that it came at a cost. He didn't consider them racists for opposing it. Charnes praises Obama as \"a straight-up guy who always told you exactly what he thought.\" The conservatives saw Obama as a moderate and threw their support behind him. Obama became the new Law Review president. In his Philadelphia speech on race, Obama tried to walk an equally fine line. He didn't disown his controversial pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, or the black church tradition from which he had emerged. Yet Obama also made clear that he understood the reaction of whites angered by Wright's denunciations. That's a hard balancing act when talking about race in the abstract\u2014detractors later criticized Obama for pandering to all sides. But it's nearly impossible with an issue as specific, and potent, as affirmative action. Should Obama become the Democratic nominee, this could be one of the tougher issues on which to find common ground. Ward Connerly\u2014a prominent opponent of affirmative action\u2014is pushing to get referendums on the subject onto ballots in at least five states this fall. It may be difficult for Obama to avoid taking a definitive stance: Affirmative action, says Connerly, \"is probably the most difficult race issue [Obama] will have to face.\" If the candidate denounces affirmative action, Connerly predicts, \"his support among blacks will plummet from around 80 to 50 percent. Then, bear in mind that much of his support in Iowa, Vermont, and Wyoming came from white males, who by a margin of 70 to 30 oppose affirmative action.\" The challenge is made all the more difficult by Obama's reputation for fresh thinking: This is a perfect chance for him to break with the liberal orthodoxy on race-based preferences, according to both conservatives and liberals who oppose these programs. To this day, some of the conservatives from the Law Review wonder whether Obama agrees with them on race-based affirmative action\u2014a testament to his skill at projecting empathy, if nothing else. \"But in politics you can only be a moderator for so long,\" says Connerly. Eventually, \"you must become a referee.\" Obama has certainly sent signals that he is not doctrinaire on the issue. In an interview last May on ABC's This Week With George Stephanopoulos, he was asked whether his own daughters should someday receive preferences in college admissions. His response was unexpected: \"I think that my daughters should probably be treated by any admissions officer as folks who are pretty advantaged.\" He added, \"I think that we should take into account white kids who have been disadvantaged and have grown up in poverty and shown themselves to have what it takes to succeed.\" His comments lit up the blogosphere with speculation that as president he might spearhead a major policy change, shifting the basis of affirmative action from race to class disparities. The ABC statement fits into Obama's record on the issue, which has never been black and white. As a 28-year-old at Harvard, Obama attended meetings of the Black Law Students Association and spoke at at least one event, demanding greater diversity on campus. But his classmate David Troutt, now a law professor at Rutgers, says he was no militant. \"There are a lot of people that spent a tremendous amount of time on that issue. They sued the school. They camped out at the dean's office,\" says Troutt. Obama wasn't among them. His head was in a different place. Students at the University of Chicago, where Obama later lectured on constitutional law, don't recall him taking a hard line there, either. Erika Walsh, who graduated in 2002 and took Obama's Equal Protection and Due Process class, says she came away with no idea about Obama's personal views on affirmative action or any other hot constitutional issue. \"The way he conducted the class, he wanted you to talk, and he would be provocative,\" she says. Andrew Janis, who graduated in 2005, took Obama's class Current Issues in Racism and the Law. Like Walsh, he has no recollection of even discussing affirmative action, which suggests either that the issue wasn't important enough to make its way on to his syllabus or that professor Obama just wasn't all that fussed about it. As a lawmaker, Obama has never had to confront the issue directly. There haven't been any major votes on affirmative action since Obama joined the U.S. Senate or during his time in the Illinois Senate. When asked about his position, the campaign points to his previous statements on the subject, in which he has defended the practice in broad terms. He has called himself \"a firm believer in affirmative action.\" In a 1998 Illinois National Political Awareness Test, Obama answered \"yes\" to questions asking whether state government agencies should take race and sex into account in \"college and university admissions, public employment and state contracting.\" And following the Supreme Court decision in 2003 in which the court charted a middle ground on affirmative action in upholding the admissions policy at the University of Michigan law school, Obama was quoted in the Chicago Defender celebrating the ruling and warning that \"George Bush is still looking to replace some members of the court, more conservative members who might end up reversing this opinion.\" Tanya House Clay, senior deputy director for public policy at People for the American Way, works closely with Obama's office on electoral reform and other issues. She says her organization \"has no reason to worry\" about his commitment to affirmative action because of his clear dedication to providing equal opportunity to all. But what Obama has done\u2014as in his comments about his daughters\u2014is to try to broaden the question of increasing diversity beyond \"race and test scores,\" as he writes in his most recent book, The Audacity of Hope: \"Affirmative action programs, when properly structured, can open up opportunities otherwise closed to qualified minorities without diminishing opportunities for white students.\" Gerald Kellman, who supervised Obama during his days as an organizer in Chicago, says the two of them never discussed affirmative action specifically but did talk about programs that \"level the playing field.\" \"Not so much advantages in being chosen,\" says Kellman, \"but things like after-school programs, tutoring, summer jobs.\" Obama wanted something done to make up for the things that poverty had denied African-American and Hispanic kids. Kellman also says Obama preferred to work through community organizing and community programs wherever possible, rather than legislation. Asked to speculate about how Obama managed to sidestep so many of the most sensitive issues about race until the Wright story exploded this month, Janis, his former student, said, \"Obama never sees race as in its own special camp. For him, race and class and gender are all different kinds of social inequality, and they are all interrelated.\" That has led some opponents to hear what they want to hear in Obama's rhetoric. The Goldwater Institute's Clint Bolick, who is helping Connerly with his anti-affirmative-action propositions, says of Obama and his comments about his own daughters: \"The fact is that he does not full-throatedly support race-based policies. What Obama is doing is opening the door to needs-based, rather than race-based, affirmative action.\" Try as one may to decode the tea leaves of Obama's handful of statements and writings about affirmative action, the truth is that you can find evidence that Obama is for race-based affirmative action and class-based affirmative action. That's not necessarily because he tells folks what they want to hear. The deeper truth seems to be that he's not that interested in affirmative action at all. People close to Obama consistently say he doesn't talk about it all that much. He wants to get beyond race as a singular, defining category in America. The folks who know Obama predict that he will not, if elected, be on a crusade to repeal or eliminate existing federal affirmative-action programs, but they're also clear that he wouldn't seek to expand them or use race to define them in new or significant ways. As is so often the case with Obama, his political and constitutional views are almost inextricable from his personal history. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in his recent book, My Grandfather's Son, describes having stuck a \"fifteen-cent price sticker\" on his diploma from Yale Law School and stowed it in his basement, because it bore the \"taint of racial preference.\" Obama chooses to look at his differently. In 2001, he told the Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, \"I have no way of knowing whether I was a beneficiary of affirmative action either in my admission to Harvard or my initial election to the Review. If I was, then I certainly am not ashamed of the fact, for I would argue that affirmative action is important precisely because those who benefit typically rise to the challenge when given an opportunity.\" Thomas never seems to have gotten past affirmative action. Obama seems not to have gotten into it. Obama proved in Philadelphia that he can understand and even transcend the hardest questions about race. Affirmative action may be one of a handful of issues on which partisans tolerate few shades of gray. A version of this piece appears in this week's Newsweek. With Eve Conant in Washington and Sarah Kliff in New York. After a month and a half off the trail, Ron Paul is back in action. We last saw Paul in his home state of Texas rallying University of Texas students in Austin. But since then, he slunk away from the presidential circuit to fight off a primary challenger in his home district on March 4. He won that battle but lost the presidency to John McCain in the meantime. While Paul was off the trail, McCain made 33 stops and reached the number of delegates needed to become the Republican nominee. But that doesn't mean Paul is done campaigning.

I always thought I had a pretty virtuous diet\u2014unless you counted the cookie I had with lunch every day and the half-pint of ice cream after dinner. My metabolism was efficient, so why worry? But then, last summer, shortly after going off the birth-control pill, I woke up one day with bad skin. When topical remedies failed me, I began to wonder whether cutting back on sugar might help. The science behind the [sugar-acne equation](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/magazine/articles/2007/12/16/a_clear_connection/) was apocryphal at best, but overhauling my diet still seemed worth a try. And so, on the stroke of midnight this past New Year's Eve, I resolved to give up sugar, long one of my favorite substances. The average American consumes a shocking [150 pounds of sugar](http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/52946) a year, or roughly [20 teaspoons](http://www.cspinet.org/new/sugar.html) every day. Such through-the-roof concentrations of added sweeteners may contribute to all sorts of health problems beyond the obvious obesity: high cholesterol and [cardiovascular disease](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12081853), diabetes, hyperactivity, insomnia, and, yes, acne. And that's not all: Sugar could also act as an [immunosuppressant](http://www.esquire.com/features/ask-dr-oz/ESQ1206droz) and cause [respiratory problems](http://cbs4denver.com/seenon/sugar.asthma.lungs.2.680161.html) like asthma. And a recent [Harvard study](http://www.newsweek.com/id/73354) posited a link between simple carbohydrates and decreased fertility. The [World Health Organization](http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2003/03/03/diet_un030303.html) has recommended cutting our sugar intake in [half](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFD9163EF93AA35750C0A9629C8B63), to no more than 10 percent of our total calorie consumption. But even 10 percent sounded like a lot to me, so I decided to rule out all high [Glycemic Index](http://www.glycemicindex.com/) substances that would spike insulin production\u2014at least for the first few weeks. That meant not just no Ben & Jerry's but no booze, no baguettes (or pizza!), no mashed potatoes, and minimal fruit and dairy. In a stroke of luck, a close friend volunteered to wean herself off sugar at the same time. She also suggested that we formally chronicle our efforts online to dissect every triumph and rough patch on our journey to sugarlessness. And while our resulting [blog](http://sugarfreemonth.blogspot.com/) was pathetically short-lived, our two-person support group indisputably served its purpose. We both learned pretty quickly that preparing our own food was the key to eliminating sugar. For me, this meant a narrowing of my daily diet. If I were some brilliant self-trained chef, I might've used the experiment to broaden my culinary range, but I'm not, so I didn't. In any event, like [David Lynch](http://wikimapia.org/28910/), I've never minded having the same meal every day. I like what I like, and I was pleased to discover that a good deal of what I like is naturally sugar-free. I began breakfasting on either scrambled eggs or, far more frequently, steel-cut [oatmeal](http://www.chieftain.com/life/1205906400/4) sweetened with either defrosted berries or grated apple and cinnamon. And despite my Seinfeldian passion for cereals\u2014particularly those ornate granolas that masquerade as health foods\u2014I forced myself to pass right over that aisle of the grocery store. For the other major meals, I ate a stripped-down version of my old diet\u2014lots of salads (homemade dressings only), three-ingredient soups, beans and brown rice, chickpea stews, quinoa medleys, and whatever other \"slow\" carbohydrates work in. (My one reach\u2014a curried bulgur dish\u2014was an embarrassing failure, never to be repeated.) For snacks, I had raw cashews and tamari almonds and guacamole and bricks of Gruyere in various combinations. Dull? Rather. A detriment to domestic harmony? Very possibly. My husband soon regretted introducing me to William Dufty's Sugar Blues, the seminal (and hilariously camp) 1975 screed against all things sugared. Though he admired my discipline, he constantly mourned our cleaned-out pantry. Still, he couldn't argue with one unanticipated benefit of our righteous new lifestyle: a dramatically lower grocery bill\u2014yes, even in these times of [agricultural crisis](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/business/13wheat.html) and despite the outrageous asking price of almonds these days. Turns out it's the packaged, processed foods that add up the fastest, the two-bite scones and frozen pizzas and other such vanquished staples of our household. Plus, maybe I was just eating less. I liked saving money, and once past the initial withdrawal period, I started to feel pretty good about my random self-betterment scheme. In no time at all, my skin was unmottled and my stomach improbably flat. Why had I ever touched refined sugar? The simple sugars present in natural foods\u2014like the dextrose in milk and the fructose in fruit\u2014didn't trouble me so much. But processed foods heavy on the sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup offered none of the health benefits of fruit and milk. The caloric density of artificially sweetened foods is itself a major problem, and in addition, they can seriously screw with our insulin response over the long term. The more refined carbohydrates we eat, the higher our insulin requirement, and the harder, over time, our bodies must work to produce appropriate insulin. According to The New Sugar Busters!, \"too much insulin promotes the storage of fat, elevation of cholesterol levels, and possibly the deposition of plaque in our coronary arteries,\" though a doctor friend tells me that refined sugar is by no means uniquely responsible for this chain of calamities. Either way, I thought I was sold. But then, on the morning of the New Hampshire primary, seven days after my diet began, I woke up craving a Starbucks chai, and I mean craving a Starbucks chai with every molecule of my being. I called my friend, hoping she'd talk me off the cliff. Before she could pick up, I slammed down the phone. Ninety seconds later, I was waiting in line at Starbucks, and I was psyched. Would I care for any snack with my beverage? Well, now that you mention it, I most certainly would! Since when was 7:32 a.m. too early to enjoy a delicious triple chocolate cupcake? Five o'clock somewhere, indeed: That cupcake was gone before I'd stepped back out into the blizzard. For my first taste of sugar in a week, it was only so-so, but then I'd never been big into Starbucks pastries. I still couldn't wait for the chai\u2014that chai promised to be the most amazing, explosive taste sensation of all space and time. But here's the thing. It wasn't. Like, not at all. Truth be told, it was actually pretty nasty\u2014monochrome and syrupy and a tad poisonous-tasting. I sipped and I grimaced, but eventually I gave up. I simply couldn't finish the drink\u2014I, who have never not finished a paid-for foodstuff in all my life! And the weirdness wasn't yet over, either. A few minutes after dumping the chai, I collapsed back into bed and passed out. Before 8 a.m. Over the course of that month, a pattern emerged. After about six days on the wagon, I would leap out of bed gripped by a raging obsession with some very specific proscribed food: pad thai, say, or a plain white bagel or a Mrs. Fields' semisweet chocolate-chip without nuts. I would then hit the streets\u2014often still in my pajamas\u2014in pursuit of that food. Once that food was in my possession, I would consume it on the spot, with or without chewing. Then, just as inevitably, would come the crash. Proof of sugar's power\u2014the flooding of my system with insulin and the subsequent drop in my blood-sugar level\u2014would knock me off-balance and send me crawling back to bed. After extended periods of living off complex, slow-release carbohydrates, I was clearly no longer inured to these rollercoaster blood-sugar fluctuations. There was another stumbling block, too: I just didn't like fretting over food all day long. My whole life, I've taken pride in not being one of those girls. You know the type I mean: the food-fixated, calorie-counting, scale-owners of our species. And so, after a month of extremes, I decided to take the middle path. When I wanted to eat fruit, I would eat fruit. If I wanted a slice of pizza or a meal in a restaurant or an entire log of goat cheese while watching cable news, I was allowed that, too. As a result, I found myself slipping up less often than before. I no longer lunged for the bread basket, and I still mostly avoided desserts. (And, Starbucks aside, straight-up desserts had always been my undoing, not soft drinks or store-bought salad dressings or other common sources of \"hidden\" sugars.) But I was no longer limiting these indulgences as some empty test of self-control. It seemed I'd just lost the urge. Who knew that the sweetness of the milk in a cappuccino could be so satisfying? These days, I'm mostly surprised by how well I've kept it up. I'm also surprised by how completely unnecessary so much of the food I used to eat was, and how little I miss those ice-cream benders. But I'd be lying if I claimed that my sugar cravings have vanished altogether. Chai is one thing; chocolate is still chocolate. Yet even my relationship with that essential food group has changed. Before going sugar-free, I had never favored dark chocolate over milk. On the contrary: I had only scorn for the pretentious [Dagoba](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/10/29/071029fa_fact_buford) devotees of my acquaintance. Now, though, I wonder whether my Butterfinger days are gone for good. Even a bar with the once-unfathomable cocoa content of 73 percent tastes textured and complicated and just sweet enough. A sharpened sense of taste is by no means my only gain. Have I mentioned my sparkling complexion? When minor flare-ups recur, it is generally within eight hours of a sugar binge. (Laugh if you like; the empirical evidence is too powerful to ignore. And a [recent study](http://www.slate.com/id/2178785/#Acne) supports this still-vague link between good skin and a low glycemic load diet.) Another unexpected boon: My periods are as regular as when I was on the pill, and preceded by zero PMS. But if I'd hoped eliminating sugar would motivate me to balance a five-hour-daily meditation practice with a rigorous course of triathlon training (and I sort of did), I can't help but be a little disappointed with the experiment. I do not feel 10 years younger or sprightlier or even 1 percent invincible. I am still lazy and achy and frequently [hyperactive](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E5D91339F931A15752C1A963958260). Still, we measure progress in baby steps. And it's been more than two months since I've banged on the door of Mrs. Fields dressed only in a nightgown and winter coat. According to a small but powerful group of America's financial decision-makers\u2014mostly supply-siders and those in their thrall\u2014the chief cause of the credit market meltdown is not folly, or reckless lending, or the demise of America's financial management. It's an accounting rule. \"Mark-to-market\" is a seemingly innocuous term for the requirement that companies, banks, hedge funds, mutual funds, and the like report the market price of the financial instruments they hold and trade. (Here's some [good background](http://news.morningstar.com/articlenet/article.aspx?id=232738) from Morningstar.) Mutual funds that own stocks make such a report every day. Publicly held firms like Bear Stearns must do so at the end of every quarter, and hedge funds must do so on a rolling basis to reassure their creditors that the assets they've put up for collateral are still worth something. Mark-to-market is thus crucial to the functioning of transparent markets. For mutual funds, marking to market is a simple affair. But for those who hold thinly traded assets or assets for which there isn't a ready market (mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt, venture capital investments, etc.), doing so is more of a challenge. In these cases, managers mark to market either by comparing analogous assets or by estimating \"what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\" In the past five years, Wall Street firms created huge volumes of new kinds of complex securities, such as subprime bonds and collateralized debt obligations, which are investment vehicles built out of subprime bond securities. These securities lacked long trading histories or deep markets. To value them, many outfits slipped the surly bonds of mark-to-market and assigned a value to them based on so-called [mark-to-model.](http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/06/cdos-mark-to-mo.html) (In other words, educated guesses based on algorithms.) When credit started to go bad, market participants had to write down the value of such assets. For institutions holding onto bank loans\u2014an asset for which there is an active secondary market\u2014marking to market was relatively simple. If markets priced bank debt of companies with a particular credit rating at 85 cents on the dollar, banks had to write down 15 cents of the value of each dollar of the loan. This process helped drive the massive write-downs seen at banks like UBS and Citigroup. But for the complex new financial instruments, the valuations became far more unstable. Many hedge funds and financial institutions had borrowed huge sums of money to buy assets for which there wasn't an active market. When that debt started to go bad, it triggered a chain of unfortunate events. In many instances, funds were forced to sell assets to meet margin calls. Occasionally, creditors would seize assets and sell them. (That's what happened to the Bear Stearns hedge funds that failed last year.) This spiraling activity had the effect of further depressing prices for such instruments. In some instances, buyers disappeared entirely. The valuations of these new instruments also plummeted because of market psychology. In establishing value for assets, funds and banks often relied on newly created indices, such as the [Markit ABX indices](http://www.markit.com/information/products/category/indices/abx.html). Since those indices are actively traded by investors, they can be driven up and down (mostly down) by speculation and fear. The end result: The banks and funds holding subprime bonds (which is to say, pretty much the entire global financial complex) have been forced to massively cut the mark-to-market value of their holdings because those values are based on the incredibly pessimistic indices. In recent weeks, some have been arguing that just as Abraham Lincoln suspended habeas corpus in a time of war, perhaps regulators should suspend mark-to-market in this time of crisis. Paul Craig Roberts, a veteran supply-sider and former Reagan administration official, [wrote](http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts03112008.html) on March 11 that the mark-to-market rule \"is imploding the U.S. financial system by requiring financial institutions to value subprime mortgages at their current market values.\" His solution: Suspend the rule, let financial institutions \"keep the troubled instruments at book value, or 85-90 percent of book value, until a market forms that can sort out values, and allow financial institutions to write down the subprime mortgages and other troubled instruments over time.\" In other words, let's assign an imaginary happy value to these assets until the seas grow calmer. Steve Forbes echoed the sentiment in his [column](http://www.forbes.com/home/columnists/forbes/2008/0407/015.html) in Forbes, calling for a 12-month suspension of mark-to-market in \"exotic financial instruments (primarily packages of subprime mortgages).\" The reason: \"It's preposterous to try to guess what these new instruments are worth in a time of panic.\" This line of thinking quickly wormed its way into McCain's big economic [speech](http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/bea72b48-35ba-48cb-8cea-b3b68b9be7ee.htm). He put it more anodyne terms: \"First, it is time to convene a meeting of the nation's accounting professionals to discuss the current mark-to-market accounting systems. We are witnessing an unprecedented situation as banks and investors try to determine the appropriate value of the assets they are holding, and there is widespread concern that this approach is exacerbating the credit crunch.\" For its part, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an [opinion letter](http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/fairvalueltr0308.htm), in which it told firms, \"[I]t is appropriate for you to consider actual market prices, or observable inputs, even when the market is less liquid than historical market volumes, unless those prices are the result of a forced liquidation or distress sale.\" The language is technical, but the arguments here are simple and really quite silly\u2014especially coming from folks who value market indicators over all else. These folks are saying that when markets are volatile and irrationally pessimistic, it's just not fair to force people to act as if the market prices are real. But you'll notice that they never made that argument back when markets were irrationally optimistic, as they were from 2003-2006. No hedge fund manager ever told a bank that it should lend him less money because the value of the collateral he was putting up was clearly a product of unwarranted optimism or that he shouldn't collect management fees based on the assets under management because their value was clearly inflated. Nobody ever complains about the market's ruthlessness and inefficiency when it's making them money. Here's how to think about the proposed reform of financial oversight unveiled by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Monday: The Federal Reserve Bank, whose job already includes regulating a large component of the financial system, has failed pretty badly at its tasks. The proposed solution\u2014to give it more responsibility\u2014seems ridiculous and hazardous. Yet that's the plan. Having ignored or been unduly confused by the complexity of the banks already under its jurisdiction, the new, improved Fed would get more books to examine for undue risk, adding in brokers and insurance companies. No one questions that the current network of financial regulators\u2014which dates to the '30s\u2014is confusing and unwieldy. There are seven existing bodies in Washington created specifically to avoid the type of looming crisis that might be created by a couple of trillion dollars' worth of opaque financial securities careening out of control. (And that's not including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, established as an independent entity to evaluate the veracity of how financial institutions value certain securities.) But Paulson's plan wants to add a couple more: the Prudential Financial Regulatory Agency to watch government-guaranteed banks and the Business Regulatory Agency to focus on consumer protection. None of that, however, will control the excesses of investment banks which, among other things, led to the mid-March meltdown of Bear Stearns. That task would putatively fall to the Fed. To some extent, that is already what the Fed is charged with doing. The Fed is supposed to maintain liquidity to grease the system (through discount windows to the \"worthy\" banks); exercise monetary policy to keep it going; control risk; and provide oversight to protect consumers. It is already regulator to much of the industry, including bank holding companies and diversified financial holding companies formed under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. Had the Fed shown any appetite or competence for these roles, we might not be in the situation we are in now. It could, for example, have questioned how certain Wall Street institutions already in its jurisdiction\u2014notably Citigroup and others that have been forced to write off billions in subprime mortgage losses\u2014were overleveraging the loans on their books. But it didn't. Today's banking system has too many intertwined players that all do one another's jobs. Its complexity is the creation of all the legislators who gleefully embraced deregulation during the last two decades. We will not solve the problem of an unstable, risk-laden banking system by putting false hope into an ill-equipped body, no matter how much added \"transparency\" has been proposed. The fundamental question remains: What is the overseeing body going to do with a more powerful window onto the financial industry? What would the Fed do if it noticed that every financial firm was creating and stockpiling risky securities and borrowing money to stockpile more? Is it realistic to believe it would intervene and cut the amount? Or let's say that the Fed knew that flawed risk parameters were being used to evaluate these flimsy securities. Wouldn't enforcing penalties be construed as an infringement on free-market capitalism? The Paulson plan does nothing to give the oversight agencies any more legal standing to intervene or enforce than they already possess. That's hardly surprising, given the vociferous opposition that greater regulation faces from Wall Street firms (to say nothing of barely regulated hedge-fund and private-equity firms). This isn't to say that requiring greater transparency from the banking industry is a bad thing. But the illusion of greater transparency at the expense of true insight is a new disaster waiting to happen. It's like jumping out of a plane with a faulty parachute; the idea of the parachute gives you confidence, but that complicated drawstring that won't engage will get you every time. Given this, it might be construed as a blessing that Paulson's proposed reforms seem unlikely to be enacted anytime soon. On Monday, Paulson said: \"These long-term ideas require thoughtful discussion and will not be resolved this month or even this year.\" Well, he's right about that. All of the plan's suggestions are cosmetic. Instead, let's please have a serious discussion about the nature of the banking system structure itself: its complexity, its responsibility, and the proper role of the federal government in regulating it. The United States has had such a debate before, leading up to the landmark 1933 Glass Steagall Act. We can and should have such a sweeping debate again. For decades, social scientists, policy wonks, and politicians have studied and debated what's come to be known as the \"culture of poverty.\" The consensus: A group of Americans is set apart from the mainstream by geography, class, and income. Its members adhere to norms that don't apply to the rest of society and engage in self-destructive behavior that imposes significant costs on the nation at large. The culture of poverty has made for potent politics (remember Ronald Reagan's fictitious welfare queen?) and spawned best-selling polemics from the right (Charles Murray) to the left (Jonathan Kozol). We don't hear as much about the culture of poverty these days. Perhaps it's because the market turmoil is making us all feel a little poorer. Or perhaps it's because a highly visible group is now exhibiting all the outward appearances of the underclass: the overclass. Forget welfare queens and the culture of poverty. Think Wall Street kings and the culture of affluence. Wall Street types don't live in ghettos, barrios, or the hollows of Appalachia, but they do inhabit environments that are sealed off socially from the rest of the world\u2014the Hamptons on Long Island; Manhattan's Fifth Avenue; Greenwich, Conn. Because they rarely interact with people of middle-class means (save the odd doctor, lawyer, or interior designer), they have become woefully out of touch with the solid bourgeois values that made America great. In the underclass, unmarried, young fathers don't take responsibility for their children. In the overclass, twice-married, middle-aged Wall Street daddies don't own up to the consequences of their insane financial miscues. Wall Street titans are almost incapable of seeing the problem with taking nine-figure payouts in years in which their stocks plummet. \"There's just a total disconnect between the compensation and the responsibility for their actions,\" says William Cohan, a former Lazard banker turned author. In his book [The Age of Abundance](http://www.amazon.com/Age-Abundance-Prosperity-Transformed-Americas/dp/0060747668/), libertarian author Brink Lindsey boils down the difference between the desperately poor and the blissfully rich to an ability to focus on the long term. \"Members of the underclass operate within such narrow time horizons and circles of trust that their lives are plagued by chronic chaos and dysfunction,\" he says. By contrast, elites are well-organized long-term thinkers. Riiiiight. \"Modern Wall Street is a system,\" says Charles Morris\u2014a former Chase banker and author of [The Trillion Dollar Meltdown](http://www.amazon.com/Trillion-Dollar-Meltdown-Rollers-Credit/dp/1586485636/)\u2014\"that rewards crazy risk-taking in the short term without regard for the long-term consequences.\" Critics point to a pervasive sense of victimhood in the underclass. But listen to what Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz told the troops after his firm succumbed to wounds that were almost entirely self-inflicted. \"We here are a collective victim of violence,\" he [said](http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/meeting-and-resenting-bears-new-boss/). Yep, just another case of the Man keeping the Man down. Conservative critics constantly carp that the culture of poverty has encouraged a sense of dependency on Washington. Of course, in recent months, the bureaucracy\u2014the Federal Reserve, the Federal Housing Authority, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac\u2014has generally ignored the struggles of poor homeowners. Yet it vaulted into action to save the bankers from their own disastrous bets. When Bear Stearns, the nation's fifth-largest investment bank, approached insolvency, the Feds orchestrated JPMorgan's acquisition of it. In 1993, the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan coined the term \"defining deviancy down.\" The prevalence of bad behavior in the underclass, he argued, caused institutions to lower standards and expectations, which effectively socialized the costs of dysfunction. Today, the Federal Reserve is \"defining solvency down.\" In recent weeks, the Fed has responded to Wall Street's crisis by systematically lowering the standards of what it would accept as collateral for loans. (Historically, only government bonds or bonds backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were good enough.) But as part of the Bear Stearns deal, it agreed to lend $30 billion against assets of dubious provenance. And guess who bears the risk if that $30 billion can't be paid back? You and me. If write-downs continue, rumor has it, the Fed might start accepting sports memorabilia, Beanie Babies, and Pok\u00e9mon card collections as collateral. There are important differences between the underclass and the overclass, notes Susan Mayer, dean of the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy Studies. The overclass is better connected, and it can cause more damage. \"Poor inner-city kids selling drugs to suburban kids can harm people,\" Mayer says. \"But financial markets can bring thousands and thousands of people to ruin.\" The pernicious culture of affluence merits further study. When self-proclaimed rogue sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh sought to learn about the culture of poverty, he hung out in Chicago's notorious Robert Taylor Homes and befriended drug dealers. The tale is chronicled in his fascinating book [Gang Leader for a Day](http://www.amazon.com/Gang-Leader-Day-Sociologist-Streets/dp/1594201501/). If he really wants to understand the workings of a dysfunctional class that's threatening American values and taxing national resources, Venkatesh, who teaches at Columbia, should move into a co-op on the Upper East Side and get a job on Morgan Stanley's trading desk. He can call his next book Hedge-Fund Manager for a Day. In the last week, the three remaining presidential candidates made big-picture economic speeches that were perfectly in keeping with the tone of their campaigns. Barack Obama delivered his [speech](http://stephencrosehome.blogspot.com/2008/03/obama-cooper-unuion-speech-on-economy.html), introduced by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg (a potential Obamacan?), at Cooper Union, a venue long identified with great oratory. Hillary Clinton tactically [delivered](http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/speech/view/?id=6695) her speech in the current battleground state of Pennsylvania and offered a list of solutions. Both campaigns have remarkably detailed (and remarkably similar) platforms on how to attack the various economic woes facing America. [John McCain](http://www.johnmccain.com/), fresh from a whirlwind tour aimed at demonstrating his foreign-policy credentials, took a somewhat different approach. There's an emerging theme surrounding his campaign: The problem with the last eight years isn't that the Bush administration had the wrong policies or was incompetent. No, the problem is that it lacked intensity. Which is why McCain is bent on offering a more concentrated, sustained, high-energy form of Bushism. Bush has been adamant about staying in Iraq until the end of his presidency; McCain is adamant about staying up to 100 years, if necessary. Bush has taken to carefully cherry-picking facts and metrics (the [number of soccer games visible](http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080327-2.html) from the air, to cite one) to construct a narrative on how well things are going there. (I bet there weren't many soccer matches in [Sadr City today](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080328/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq).) McCain prefers [simple declarations](http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/03/25/803794.aspx) to data points: \"We're winning. I don't care what people say. I've seen the facts on the ground.\" The same holds true for the economy. By virtue of his history as a deficit hawk, a foe of earmarks, and an opponent of the Bush tax cuts\u2014not to mention the presence of reality-based advisers like Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office\u2014McCain deserves some benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately, the [brains behind the economic operation seems to be former Sen. Phil Gramm](http://money.cnn.com/2008/02/18/news/newsmakers/tully_gramm.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2008021917), the Texas A&M economist-turned-senator who confidently [forecast](http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2000/0006.thompson.html) in 1993 that the Clinton program of spending cuts and tax increases on the wealthy would be \"a one-way ticket to recession.\" And the sections on McCain's Web site about domestic policy reveal, as Matt Yglesias [noted](http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/03/mccain_on_education.php), \"a nearly astounding level of vacuity.\" Reading McCain's [economic agenda](http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/0B8E4DB8-5B0C-459F-97EA-D7B542A78235.htm) and listening to his speech, it appears that the problem with the last eight years is that we haven't seen enough tax breaks for the wealthy, that economic royalism hasn't been pursued with sufficient vigor, and that the middle and working classes haven't been stiffed sufficiently. McCain wants to extend the Bush tax cuts, which he once opposed as a needless sop to the rich in a time of war. (I await David Brooks' inevitable explanation of how opposing taxes in a time of war in 2001 and 2003, when deficits were low, but supporting them in 2011, in a time of war and high deficits, is deeply moral and admirable.) But McCain wants to see Bush's tax relief and raise it some. McCain would slash the corporate-income-tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent (because corporate profits as a percentage of GDP [didn't spike enough this decade](http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/08/28/business/28wages_chart.html)?), and he'd abolish the Alternative Minimum Tax, which would be a welcome move for many upper-middle-class taxpayers. \"In all, his tax-cutting proposals could cost about $400 billion a year, according to estimates of the impact of different tax cuts by CBO and the McCain campaign,\" the Wall Street Journal [reported](http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB120451614688707083.html). And how to make up for the lost revenues? Hmmm. McCain promises to cut earmarks; to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse; and to reduce the projected growth of Medicare; but he won't provide many numbers. As the WSJ deadpanned: \"The cost will make it difficult for him to achieve his goal of balancing the budget by the end of his first term.\" That's perhaps the understatement of the year. [The ]()2009 budget calls for a deficit of $407 billion on projected receipts of $2.7 trillion [*](#correct), as this [table](http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/summarytables.html) shows. Essentially, McCain wants to cut revenues by about 15 percent from current levels, with nothing close to that in spending reductions, in a time when, even after spending excess Social Security payroll taxes, the deficit is running at more than $400 billion. Here's some straight talk: McCain's fiscal program is either a joke or a fantasy. McCain's housing [speech](http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/bea72b48-35ba-48cb-8cea-b3b68b9be7ee.htm), delivered in Orange County, Calif., ground zero of the housing crisis, was a mixed bag. He provided a good description of the problem. But his solution to an era in which financial deregulation set the stage for federal bailouts, rampant speculation, and reckless lending is ... less regulation. \"Our financial market approach should include encouraging increased capital in financial institutions by removing regulatory, accounting, and tax impediments to raising capital.\" Bizarrely, he has also joined the chorus arguing that [ mark-to-market accounting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_to_market)\u2014the rules that require companies to, you know, tell investors the actual market value of assets they hold\u2014should be revisited. The Federal Reserve and the Bush administration have justified the extraordinary help offered to investment banks and investors by saying that it matters less how we got here and more how we deal with the situation as it is. For McCain, however, it's all about the journey. Poor decisions should not be rewarded\u2014unless those poor decisions are made by really rich people who run investment banks and hedge funds. While \"those who act irresponsibly\" shouldn't be bailed out as a matter of principle, it's OK to take extraordinary measures to help banks prevent \"systemic risk that would endanger the entire financial system and the economy.\" Obama and Clinton\u2014and the Bush administration, through its various efforts to ease the mortgage crisis\u2014have argued that it might be possible to spare further systemic risk if something were done to buck up the fortunes of homeowners. Bollocks, says McCain. People should just put up more money for down payments and work harder to keep current with their mortgage payments. Straight talk? No doubt. At a time of rampant economic insecurity and [low consumer confidence](http://www.conference-board.org/economics/ConsumerConfidence.cfm), at the end of a business cycle in which median incomes didn't rise and the percentage of working people with health insurance fell, McCain won't succumb to the easy temptation of saying that government policy can help improve the situation. But smart politics? I wonder. What's left of the Republican Party is becoming increasingly downscale, and many swing states have been ravaged by the housing crisis (Nevada, Florida) and globalization (Ohio, Michigan). Besides, he's already got the let-them-eat-cake vote sewed up. [Correction](), March 31, 2008: This article originally misstated that the 2009 budget projected receipts of $2.7 billion. The correct figure is $2.7 trillion. ( [Return](#return) to the corrected sentence.) Leatherheads (Universal), George Clooney's third outing as a director and the first in which he plays a starring role, has everything going for it on paper. Setting a screwball comedy against the backdrop of the emergence of professional football in the 1920s sounds like a rollicking idea. The period songs and costumes are as jaunty as can be. And the casting of Clooney, our era's Clark Gable, as aging football star Dodge Connolly is a natural. So, why does the whole thing feel sloggier than the climactic game, a near-scoreless battle waged in a lake of mud? Much as I'd like to, I can't put all the blame on Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. I've always had an animus toward this actress, with her self-congratulatory cuteness and incessant mugging. But I have to admit she's nicely cast as spunky newspaper reporter Lexie Littleton, who begins to follow Dodge's team, the Duluth Bulldogs, after they recruit a popular college player, Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski). Carter is also a WWI hero, known for having single-handedly captured a whole company of German soldiers in the battle of the Argonne. Lexie's editor (Jack Thompson) finds the whole story suspicious and puts Lexie on Carter's trail. Lexie's initial strategy, in the grand pre-feminist Barbara Stanwyck style, is to seduce Carter into spilling the beans about what really happened in the war. But George Clooney being George Clooney\u2014all the more so in a speakeasy\u2014she can concentrate only so long on that skinny guy from The Office. Leatherheads' overlong middle section is devoted to the vagaries of the Dodge/Lexie/Carter love triangle, as Clooney and Zellweger exchange semi-snappy banter while the hopelessly upstaged Krasinski moons on the sidelines. It was enough to make this sports-averse viewer wish for a little more pigskin. It's fascinating to learn that pro football as we know it is a relatively new sport and that, as recently as the mid-1920s, the game was unregulated, poorly attended, and on the verge of bankruptcy (even as college football drew huge audiences). The movie nostalgically contrasts Dodge's disappearing version of the game\u2014essentially, a barroom brawl between two goalposts\u2014with Carter's emerging one, an efficient business dependent on advertising money. But the script\u2014which was written by two Sports Illustrated reporters with a long history of covering football\u2014seems reluctant to explore this contrast, perhaps for fear of alienating its female audience. Personally, I'd have preferred to see more of the backroom tactics of the nation's first football commissioner (an arresting Peter Gerety) and less of Zellweger pouting in period hats. Still, Leatherheads is better than a finger in your eye. It's a perfectly passable, if instantly forgettable, date movie, lushly shot by Newton Thomas Sigel and with a script intelligently versed in American classics like His Girl Friday and Hail the Conquering Hero. Maybe Clooney has just raised our expectations too high with his uninterrupted ascent from \"that dude on E.R.\" to respected lefty director/producer (by way of [Messenger of Peace](http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=25332&Cr=clooney&Cr1=) and [Sexiest Man Alive](http://popsugar.com/65343)). At this point in his career, he's earned the right to make a movie that's just OK. If Clooney's contemplating going retro again for his next project, may I suggest a remake of It Happened One Night? Reese Witherspoon would make a fine latter-day Claudette Colbert, instead of just going bare-chested as Gable [famously did](http://www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/i/ithappenedonenight.q.shtml), Clooney could guarantee big box office by taking it all off.

When ABC [reported the scoop](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/04/candidate-clint.html) that Hillary Clinton told Bill Richardson that Barack Obama couldn't win in the general election, I thought it was a good nugget but not surprising. It's not as if she'd previously said she'd be a better nominee because Obama is a bad dancer. The Clinton campaign has been arguing that Obama can't win in the general election for months. He can't win big states; he can't win among key constituencies like blue-collar voters, Latinos, and Catholics; he can't beat McCain; he can't pass the commander-in-chief test. The electability charge is, in fact, the only basis Clinton has left as she battles to overthrow Obama's lead among pledged delegates. It's nearly on Clinton's campaign signs. But as thoroughly obvious as the Clinton remark is, it's the kind of plain-as-the-nose-on-your-face statement that candidates are never supposed to actually make out loud. They'll walk you up to the idea. They'll even sound out the vowels to help you say it yourself, but in primary season, no one is supposed to actually say, \"He can't win\" or \"He doesn't have the credentials to be commander in chief.\" Her campaign will suggest that your sleeping children [could be extinguished in their beds](http://www.slate.com/id/2185492/) if Obama is elected, but when Clinton is asked at a debate if Obama is not ready to be president, she'll say that's for the voters to decide. The prediction that Obama will be a general-election failure is so taboo that now that Clinton has said it, her aides won't repeat it. After a conference call devoted to stacking up all the reasons Obama would lose to McCain, I asked Clinton's top strategist and spokesman if they were saying, as Bill and Hillary Clinton have said privately, that Obama can't win. \"No,\" the Clinton aides dodged, they're merely arguing that Clinton is the better candidate. A version of this happens in Obamaland, too. In response to Clinton's claims that Obama is unelectable, the Obama campaign has initiated its own version of the same accusation over the last few weeks. Clinton can't win in a general election when voters think she has a \"credibility gap.\" \"To head into a general election with over half the electorate not believing you are trustworthy is a serious problem,\" campaign manager David Plouffe said. \"The American people will not elect a candidate that they do not see as trustworthy.\" Taking the Obama argument to its logical conclusion, I asked campaign adviser Greg Craig, who has known Hillary Clinton since college but is siding with the other guy, if he thought she was fundamentally dishonest. He was on one of the Obama conference calls at which this was essentially asserted. But, of course, he demurred. He was just on the call to dispute her foreign-policy claims, he said. The Obama camp wants you to hear the charge that Clinton is a liar, but they play peekaboo by framing it in terms of the political challenge her candidacy poses for Democrats. They never want to come out and just say liar by itself. When Barack Obama agreed in a New York Times interview that Clinton had not been fully truthful six months ago, he took a lot of heat. He has never gone that far again. Why not say what you mean? Two reasons. Neither campaign wants to be accused of giving John McCain any statements that he can use in the general election against the eventual Democratic nominee. Also, in the event that the candidates wind up as each other's running mate or even just campaigning for the other one in November, they don't want to have to eat too many of their own words. \"It's a thin but important line,\" says a Clinton staffer. Still, getting across the idea that a candidate is fundamentally flawed matters. It's a more powerful argument than saying he's less good. If he's merely that, voters can take a chance on him, knowing they aren't really risking a few bedrock Democratic principles. The party won't be at risk of nominating a conservative Supreme Court justice or launching a new war against Iran. If a voter, or better a superdelegate, can be convinced that a candidate is doomed, on the other hand, then you can move them to your man or woman as the safer, if less appealing, choice. This is what's at stake when Clinton aides discuss the incendiary remarks of Obama's pastor Jeremiah Wright, as Greg Sargent of Talking Points Memo [reported earlier this week](http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/ickes_confirms_hes_been_pushin.php). The question the Clinton camp wants on everyone's minds is whether Obama's pastor will sink him in the general. The Democratic campaign, then, has come down to the question of which candidate is fundamentally flawed, even though neither side wants to really come out and say this. It's a way to get what you want, you hope, without taking responsibility. My son used to do a version of the same thing. He'd hold up his hands over his eyes and pretended we couldn't see him. School reform advocates in Chicago have of late been [heralding](http://www.designsforchange.org/curiefactsheet.html) Barack Obama as a champion of local school councils, Chicago's hyperlocal system of school governance. Unique among big-city school districts in the United States, these independent, elected bodies at each school are made up of parents, teachers, and community members, 10 in all, plus the principal. Think of them as mini school boards, parent-teacher organizations on steroids, or condo boards for schools. Created 20 years ago, these councils each hire and fire their own principals. Though firings aren't common, they turn out to be a very big deal. Dismissing a principal is the education equivalent of capital punishment. It's often career-ending. It disrupts a school to the core. And it sends shock waves out through the rest of the system. The councils\u2014each dominated by six parents\u2014are not all-powerful, however. Since 1995, Chicago has also had a central Board of Education overseen by the mayor that, among other things, has the power to close schools and open new ones. Not surprisingly, the relationship has been extremely uneasy between the central board office (dominated by college-educated professionals) and individual school councils (dominated by minority parents, not all of them college-educated). Put simply, some advocates think LSCs are the best and only real way to improve Chicago schools\u2014by emphasizing local control, curriculum flexibility, and parent involvement. Others think that making each school independent is an indulgent holdover from another era that mostly gets in the way of improving accountability in a massive, 600-school system. In reality, Obama never really championed the local councils. He supported them behind the scenes and only eventually came out publicly on their behalf. When he did weigh in, he came down on the wrong side of the debate\u2014against protecting principals from unwarranted dismissals and in favor of keeping councils independent, no matter what. In the end, the resolution of the conflict between the two sides didn't alleviate anyone's concerns. Instead, it prolonged a turf battle that seems to have dragged down academic progress in the years since. The story of Obama's involvement suggests that on similarly contentious fronts involving national education policy, like the No Child Left Behind Act, he might respond the same way\u2014holding back when powerful interest groups collide, only to support the status quo of local control in the end. The candidate's Chicago record on education also raises questions about his much-vaunted ability to bring different sides together to find lasting solutions. Obama's links to local school councils began more than 20 years ago, when they were first being created. His South Side community organizing group, the Developing Communities Project, supported the 1988 reform act that created the councils. A decade later, when Obama was a second-year state senator, he served on the board of several local education foundations that had supported the councils and chaired the board for the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, a $50 million philanthropic effort that supported local control. In 1999, hard-charging schools chief Paul Vallas went to the Illinois Legislature to win more control over principal hiring and firing. Vallas headed the Chicago schools between 1995 and 2001. His get-tough initiatives\u2014mandating summer school for students who failed end-of-year exams, for example\u2014got glowing press coverage and earned him not one but two mentions in President Clinton's State of the Union speeches. Vallas wanted to make sure in 1999 that his precious cadre of experienced principals wouldn't continue to get bounced out of their schools for no good reason. In particular, he wanted to limit the LSCs' power to dismiss principals at the end of their four-year contracts. Each year, a small number of councils (maybe 15 percent of the roughly 150 principals who are up for renewal in any given year) would opt not to renew their principals' contracts. Most of the time, the decisions weren't controversial. But occasional surprises\u2014and concerns about the lack of any real oversight or appeal provisions\u2014 [dogged the process from the start](http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DF133BF931A35750C0A966958260). Vallas felt that some effective principals were being let go because they were white or because of personal conflicts. He proposed giving himself the authority to review and approve most decisions to let principals go, styling the change as an \"accountability\" measure. Local-control advocates called it an attempt to \"gut\" local control. Both were right. Taking away the LSCs' power to fire principals would have hamstrung the councils' independence. But independent LSCs had done a good job at opening up the school system to parents without transforming student achievement. Vallas was trying to complete the centralization that had begun in 1995, when the state gave the mayor a say over the schools. In that context, leaving the LSCs in place just made no sense, particularly given the need to make greater academic strides. Obama was uniquely well-placed to take the lead in mediating this battle. He had a relatively strong background in community and education issues. He was friends and pickup-basketball buddies with Arne Duncan, who was then in charge of magnet schools (and has since taken over Vallas' job). Obama also knew Vallas, who liked him. Then, as now, he was considered a politician who could unify people and resolve challenging conflicts. And in a racially charged debate like this one\u2014Vallas was a tall white guy who sent his kids to parochial school\u2014it didn't hurt that Obama was black. To be sure, it would have been no easy feat to bring Vallas and local-school advocates to the table, and there's no guarantee that the effort would have worked. New and unknown to many other Democratic lawmakers, Obama wasn't even on the education committee. Still. For several months, Obama didn't indicate clearly where his sympathies lay. He didn't join with protesters and other legislators who swarmed public events denouncing the Vallas proposal. He didn't talk to the press about the importance of community engagement for schools or the unfairness of diminishing the influence of the 5,500 elected LSC members. Obama kept tabs on the negotiations through his staff, met occasionally with local-control advocates, and, according to those who were involved, sometimes provided ideas and advice in private. But that was about it. Some local advocates weren't even sure whether he would ultimately be on their side or not. And many worried that without someone like Obama to stop it, the Vallas juggernaut would overrun any opposition. In the end, support for Vallas' proposal suddenly collapsed, the victim of political infighting within the district. A face-saving provision was added to the existing LSC law that allowed principals to appeal their dismissals to an outside arbitration board, but it was written so narrowly that it was all but unusable. \"We put it in there as a fig leaf for Vallas,\" recalls a legislative staffer who was involved in the negotiations. \"It wasn't something that was supposed to be used.\" Only after the fig leaf was in place did Obama come out publicly in support of local school councils, making a [brief speech](http://pureparents.org/data/files/Obamaonarbitration99.pdf) (PDF) on the Senate floor to codify the final agreement preserving local councils' authority. To his credit, Obama didn't augment racial division. Vallas was in essence trying to take control away from poor and minority parents. He credits Obama with never having played the race card. \"Barack could have taken the bait but he didn't,\" says Vallas, now head of the New Orleans schools. \"He never demagogued the issue.\" In being so late to the debate, however, Obama didn't really have to stand up to anyone\u2014not the groups he was affiliated with, not Vallas, not Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. He was just approving the final result. He remained loyal to his roots, but only when it was easy to do so. To some critics, this is exactly the problem. \"Obama has no history of standing up to school interests or anyone else,\" says Dan Cronin, the Republican state senator who handled the 1999 legislation (and recalls little if any involvement from Obama). \"If you look at his past record, there's nothing that's particularly bold or creative.\" Partisan judgments aside, Obama missed the opportunity to address long-standing questions about unwarranted dismissals of principals or to resolve the conflicted relationship between LSCs and the central Chicago school board. There is still no meaningful way for principals to appeal their dismissals; few have tried, and not one has been reinstated. And the structural conflicts remain between what are essentially two different systems of governance. (New York City avoided this problem by doing away with its community school districts at roughly the same time it gave control of the school board to the mayor.) Tension between local control and centralized accountability isn't just a problem in Chicago, of course. It's also at the core of the debate over No Child Left Behind, the 2002 federal law that requires annual testing by states in reading and math and mandates publication of test score results for poor and minority students. For more than six years, state and local educators have complained that such mandates get in the way of local control and flexibility. Based on Obama's actions in Chicago in 1999, it's hard to imagine him taking charge of the continuing debate over whether and how No Child Left Behind should be renewed. Forced to take a side, Obama's record suggests that, ultimately, he would be sympathetic to local autonomy. But there's not much evidence to show that he would be able to help mend deep and abiding schisms between testing hawks and local-control advocates. And without strong and unifying national leadership, our troubled public-education system stands little chance of making the dramatic improvements that it needs. What did Barack Obama offer Bill Richardson for his endorsement? Nothing, say both the Obama and Richardson camps, but this is the question angry and jilted Clinton supporters are asking in the wake of Richardson's announcement a week ago that he would support Obama rather than their woman. Despite Clinton strategist Mark Penn's effort to downplay the endorsement, Richardson's move was very helpful to Obama. When Richardson said he'd decided to back Obama in part because of Obama's speech reacting to the uproar over his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, his move became a symbolic end point to the controversy. Richardson also went beyond mere praise, calling for Democrats to rally around Obama and bring the contest to a close. It is a standard tactic to accuse a turncoat of having been bought off. Some would say this is the Corleone reflex in the Clinton world, which punishes those who stray. What better way to malign Richardson than to claim low motives, which undermines Richardson's professed reason\u2014that he was inspired by Obama's grand speech on race. But Clinton supporters say Richardson was poised to join the family\u2014in fact, he was already a charter member\u2014and the speed of his reversal makes them think self-interest must have played a role in his jump. Many of those who are angriest have known Richardson a long time and have raised money for his various campaigns. They talked to him while he was sitting on the fence, and in those conversations, they say, he signaled his eventual support for Hillary. Why renege on old friends? A grand offer must have been in the offing, the detractors surmise. On Thursday, I talked to one of those in the Clinton circle who had talked to Richardson, and that source said the damning reason the former energy secretary gave for his then-apparent plan to support Clinton was Obama's lack of experience\u2014the central nail Clinton has been hammering. Not to mention that experience was the basis for Richardson's own presidential campaign. On Larry King Live on Thursday night, James Carville, who branded Richardson \"Judas\" for what Carville said was a particularly high level of betrayal, named a handful of Clinton fundraisers who say they had similar cheery conversations with Richardson. Richardson also gave former President Bill Clinton the impression that he would ultimately back Hillary Clinton as well as Bill Clinton's top aides. When Bill Clinton called Richardson on hearing the news of his endorsement switch, Richardson refused to return his phone calls. \"I wouldn't treat President Bush the way he treated President Clinton,\" says Carville. Richardson's communication director, Gilbert Gallegos, says no such representations were made to anyone connected to Clinton and that when Bill Clinton flew to New Mexico to watch the Super Bowl with Richardson, the governor was clear about his intentions. \"Gov. Richardson told President Clinton not to come to New Mexico for the Super Bowl if he expected an endorsement,\" says Gallegos. This has been a bad week for Clinton's financial backers. In addition to the Richardson betrayal, they also feel that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has turned on them. Despite their years of supporting the party, they have been unable to use their leverage to move Pelosi away from what they see as her public support for Obama. Though Pelosi says she is neutral, she has said that the superdelegates should follow the will of the pledged delegates. Since Obama holds an insurmountable lead among the pledged delegates, this is just a long way for her to say, \"Elect Barack.\" Clinton fundraisers [wrote to Pelosi](http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/03/in_letter_a_dozen_top_clinton.php) asking that she retract her remarks and support the party rules that allow superdelegates to vote their conscience. Furious at the letter, [she refused to](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/2008/03/27/2008-03-27_hillary_clintons_wealthy_pals_warn_nancy.html). What's significant about the Pelosi and Richardson duet is that both seem to have made a calculation that in the long-brewing tension between party elites and the new grass roots, they're siding with the latter. These veteran Democrats may be making their moves based on their assessments of Obama as a candidate, but they also may be informed by his success in raising money online and from a huge number of small-dollar donors, which may mean a dilution in the power of traditional rainmakers. As a sign of the new landscape, Moveon.org sent out a fundraising letter asking Pelosi to stand her ground. Richardson, through a spokesman, denies that he told anyone he would support Clinton. Those who know him say that as a politician who has negotiated with some of the world's trickiest foreign leaders, he knows how to let people \"believe what they want to believe,\" as one put it. Both Obama's and Richardson's spokesmen offer ironclad denials that Obama offered Richardson anything specifically or implicitly in the way of a quid pro quo, and there is no actual evidence of any kind of deal. What Bill Richardson did or didn't extract from Barack Obama in return for his timely support may not be known until Obama wins the nomination and picks his running mate or wins the election and names his Cabinet. But there is one other little piece of evidence that suggests Richardson must have wrested some promise in return for his support. It's contained in the \" [Richardson Rules](http://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/Between_Worlds_Bill_Richardson.htm),\" his pointers for how to negotiate: \"Don't concede absolutely everything the other side is requesting. Get something in return, even if it's minor.\" When Vannevar Bush first dreamt of [hyperlinks](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/194507/bush) back in the 1940s, surely he envisioned something tidier than the link riots that erupt on many of today's Web pages. The extraneous links etched into most Washingtonpost.com stories, for example, make it look as though an insect rode a unicycle dipped in blue ink through the copy before you got there. Almost any Washingtonpost.com or Nytimes.com news story demonstrates the sites' link-happy tendencies. A good example of the Washingtonpost.com's overkill is this [Page One](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/30/AR2008033002138_pf.html) story from Monday about the alleged budget crunch faced by some states. In the first 95 words, the story links [Illinois](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/Illinois?tid=informline), Washingtonpost.com landing pages containing general news, video, and audio about those places. No thinking human would ever add these links\u2014obviously, a human has programmed a computer to automatically insert them. Of what use are such landing pages? For the reader, little. They exist for the publisher to serve another page of ads and to optimize search engine results. I don't oppose sites serving ads or optimizing pages to improve search results\u2014as long as the strategies don't waste readers' time. But that's what many of the landing pages do. The real sin here is how extraneous links induce link shyness: When the time comes that the reader will benefit from clicking on a link, he'll not bother because the site has taught him its links are worthless. Next up on my hate list are links that come alive when you mouse over them. On many business sites, a pop-over bullies its way onto the page when your cursor lands on a keyword or phrase, offering to fetch you a stock quote or company news, conduct a search, or impose a frigging ad on you. These pop-overs really suck when they obscure the copy I want to read. See this [Bloomberg.com](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&sid=a.q6pWAmK0og&refer=home) page for a modest example of this practice and [Yahoo News](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080403/ap_on_re_af/zimbabwe_elections;_ylt=Av4NLo4bJN_izt4PLG21n_Cs0NUE) and [Breitbart.com](http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8VPPAU80&show_article=1&catnum=0) for really obnoxious ones. (Ryan Block of Engadget has [declared war](http://www.ryanblock.com/2007/08/an-open-letter-to-friends-and-colleagues-on-keyword-popovers/) on keyword pop-over ads.) I despise sites like the Nytimes.com that think double-clicks of a word should automatically open a new window and fill it with the word's definition. Please show me where I can turn this \"feature\" off! I've reserved a superscalding hypercircle of hell for [Yahoo News](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080403/ap_on_re_af/zimbabwe_elections;_ylt=Av4NLo4bJN_izt4PLG21n_Cs0NUE), which thinks double-clicking a word means I want a billboard of additional news and search options to spring from the page. Don't bother telling me how to turn this feature off. I'll just avoid Yahoo News altogether. (And every page tainted with [Snap Shots](http://www.snap.com/?source=pub-6332280-www.techcrunch.com&campaign=snap-shots-logo).) Only slightly less maddening are the sites and [writers](http://www.slate.com/id/2103845/#here) that think a links package that reads \"click here, here, here, and here for more\" is an inducement to visit additional pages. If a writer is too lazy to indicate where the link is going to take me, I'm too busy to click. (Along those lines, I could do without the overdone links that make an entire paragraph linkable.) Gawker's mixed-link philosophy also grates on me. Some links in its copy lead to Gawker [landing pages](http://gawker.com/tag/britney-spears/). That's bad. Others lead to specific Gawker stories or to outside stories, which are also relevant. That's good. I wish the site didn't force me to inspect the status line of my browser to see where a text link is about to take me. Mr. Denton, remove those landing-page links from inside your stories! Here's my last bitch: Why doesn't every newspaper Web site routinely link directly to the competition's work? If a competitor's story is good enough to cite in the copy, it's good enough to link to. Examples: A [recent](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/02/AR2008040200077.html) Washingtonpost.com story cited an Nytimes.com story but linked to a [generic page](http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/The+New+York+Times+Company?tid=informline) about the Times. The Nytimes.com does no better, citing a news-breaking Washington Post story in a [recent](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/washington/01jackson.html?scp=4&sq=%2522washington+post%2522&st=nyt&pagewanted=print) article but not linking to it. (I can't even locate a landing page for the Washington Post on Nytimes.com. Subtle slap or oversight?) There is, I'm happy to report, one old-school print journalist whose stories point to the greater Web when they're put online. His name is [Frank Rich](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/opinion/30rich.html?_r=1&oref=slogin), and unlike so many of his newspaper peers, he links to the competition, the out-of-town newspapers, the blogs, the candidates' Web sites, TV transcripts, YouTube, survey results, and his own publication's copy. It's the way it should be done, and I'm not saying that just because it's the way nearly all Slate writers do it. ****** Ryan Block suggests [remedies](http://www.ryanblock.com/2007/08/disable-intellitxt-and-keyword-popovers-some-solutions-for-the-end-user/) (Firefox add-ons, etc.) for the most obtrusive ads but hopes you won't modify your browser to block all ads because then he (and I) would be thrown out of work.

Rupert Murdoch addressed the students and faculty of Georgetown University this afternoon, explaining the \"creative destruction\" wrought upon the news and entertainment industries by changing technology. Murdoch cast himself as a relentless competitor, which he is, who has taken on entrenched monopolies and oligopolies around the world, which is also true. (FishbowlDC's Patrick W. Gavin [live-blogged](http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/newspapers/liveblogging_murdoch_81425.asp) the event.) As speeches go, it neither electrified the crowd nor induced itchy posterior syndrome. Murdoch got off a couple of good jokes about the similarities between the Jesuits, who founded Georgetown, and his company, News Corp. \"The Jesuits and News Corp. attract highly talented people from all over the world. The Jesuits and News Corp. like to challenge the status quo. And both the Jesuits and News Corp. have a reputation of independence and innovation. Of course, there are some differences. I don't want to discourage anyone from considering the priesthood, but I will tell you that at News Corp. we don't insist on vows of poverty or chastity,\" Murdoch said. \"And as chief executive, I can tell you I'm not sure about the degree of obedience, either.\" The rotten old bastard did his best work while taking questions from the crowd after his 20-minute set, answering candidly about his ambitions to buy Newsday (it would make a good business fit with his struggling New York Post), why he won't be buying Yahoo (he says he doesn't have as much money as Microsoft's Mr. Gates), and press bias (he thinks a thousand points of view should bloom, or something like that). He miscued, however, at a couple of junctures. While talking about political bias and the news, he said: The Washington Post [company] has a site called Slate, and the guy who runs that calls me the Antichrist. Jacob Weisberg, the guy who runs Slate, has never called Murdoch the Antichrist, according to Nexis. Nor have I. Perhaps he was confusing Weisberg with the guy who runs the New York Times? A September 2007 [Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/09/wolff200709?currentPage=2) piece by Michael Wolff reported that Times Executive Editor Bill Keller once \"angrily confronted\" Murdoch lieutenant Gary Ginsberg and said, \"How can you work for the Antichrist?\" Keller says he didn't \"confront\" the Murdoch employee, whom he had known for a while. And he wasn't angry. \"I greeted Gary, smilingly, with something like, 'So I gather you've gone to work for the Antichrist.' It was a joke,\" Keller writes via e-mail. \"Maybe it's true, as someone said, that there's no such thing as a joke. But it was a joke.\" The only question to derail Murdoch was a politely worded query from a Chinese student who wanted to know what steps News Corp. would take to support freedom of speech, human rights, and democracy in China. \"I'd better be careful answering this\u2014I always get into trouble when talking about China,\" Murdoch said to many laughs. \"Especially from my Chinese wife.\" Murdoch then recounted the criticism he's faced for evicting BBC News from his Asian satellite-TV company, Star. The BBC was paying $10 million a year for the slot, he told the assembly. \"The BBC has a lot more money than I; they can get their own transponder and their own satellite. And that was taken as me kowtowing to the Chinese government. And I've had that hung around my neck forever,\" he said. Hold it right there, Rupe, and let me tighten that necktie with a retrospective of your comments about the BBC and Star. After News Corp. purchased Star in 1993, it dumped the BBC because its news coverage displeased Chinese authorities, a point that was widely reported as fact. The company downplayed those stories for a few months until Murdoch told his biographer, William Shawcross, the truth. Chinese leaders \"hate the BBC,\" Murdoch told Shawcross. Of his critics, Murdoch said, \"They say it's a cowardly way, but we said in order to get in there and get accepted, we'll cut the BBC out.\" This turnabout was reported in both the June 14, 1994, Wall Street Journal (\"Rupert Murdoch ... has acknowledged months after the fact that he yanked British Broadcasting Corp. news from his satellite television service in northern Asia in hopes of soothing bad relations with China\") and the June 14, 1994, Financial Times (\"Mr. Rupert Murdoch ... has finally admitted that he kicked BBC World Service Television off his Star TV system in Asia to please the Chinese government and help establish the satellite service there.\") (One of Murdoch's top guys [tells](http://www.slate.com/id/2184197/) a similar story in his recent book Rupert's Adventures in China: How Murdoch Lost a Fortune and Found a Wife.) Then, 13 years later, Murdoch decided to recant his confession, insisting in the May 24, 2007, [Financial Times](http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/greenslade/2007/05/murdoch_chinese_decisions_were.html) that: Star was losing $100m per year; we had to pay $10m per year to the BBC. I said \"Let them pay it themselves,\" and they did. We also cancelled two other third-party channels\u2014MTV and Prime Sports. At that stage we never ever had any request from anybody in China. Indeed, there was no discourse at all. That he's a demonstrably poor teller of lies proves, once and for all, that Murdoch is not the Antichrist. ****** What I do call Murdoch every chance I get is a [genocidal tyrant](#2188105). But even a genocidal tyrant can have a good day. Like today! One of his newspapers, the Australian, ran a lengthy review of Rupert's Adventures in China, which the Australian Web magazine Crikey calls \"earnest, broadly discursive, insightful and sometimes amusing.\" What makes this newsworthy, of course, is that the Murdoch-owned Far Eastern Economic Review spiked a review of the book [last month](http://www.slate.com/id/2185364/) in an act of what the author of Rupert's Adventures would describe as \"anticipatory compliance.\" Send your Murdoch musings to [slate.pressbox@gmail.com](mailto:slate.pressbox@gmail.com).

Return to [article](#back2188105) Rupert Murdoch, Genocidal Tyrant? To the best of my knowledge, nobody ever called Rupert Murdoch a genocidal tyrant until he introduced the useful image in a summer 2007 conference call. Here's how the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/09/AR2007080901972.html) reported it. Rupert Murdoch wanted the Wall Street Journal badly enough to endure a summer's worth of hurt feelings. \"That's ... why I spent the better part of the past three months enduring criticism that is normally leveled at some sort of genocidal tyrant,\" the 76-year-old global media tycoon said yesterday during a conference call on News Corp.'s fourth-quarter results. \"If I didn't think it was such a perfect fit with such unlimited potential to grow on its own and in tandem with News Corp. assets, believe me, I would have walked away.\" As recently as March 24, the New York Times' A section began with its traditional gallop. After bombarding readers with its incendiary Page One, the newspaper dared readers to catch their breath with the Page 2 \"News Summary.\" The sprint resumed and didn't end until the last news page had been turned. Then on March 25, the Times more than doubled the space given to summaries, spreading them over Pages 2 and 3 and renaming the feature \"Inside the Times.\" Page 4, once the reliable home of international news, now does meta duty, too, presenting a digest of NYTimes.com pages and serving as the paper's new home for corrections. Now the newspaper reads as if it begins with three speed bumps. For ink-stained page turners, it was as if the quicksilver Times had put out deck chairs and free tea and invited readers to linger over the news\u2014instead of bolting after it like wild dogs. For many veteran readers of the Times, these magaziney table-of-contents pages fit like a loose suit and read like a celebration of white space. What did the paper cut to accommodate this expansion? Tom Bodkin, assistant managing editor and design director at the Times, says the paper's new kickoff doesn't come at the expense of any inside news or features. And rather than trying to ruin the paper with a Chinese-restaurant-length menu, Bodkin asserts that he is trying to improve the paper. \"People say they have less and less time to read the paper,\" Bodkin says. Any way you look at it, he adds, competition for readers' attention has never been greater. The new summary acreage will provide readers with useful \"shortcuts\" to the tens of thousands of words inside and help direct their attention to Web site features they'd otherwise miss. Arriving with the new pages is a redesigned reefer box at the bottom of Page One, one that further redefines navigation, as well as a more emphatic introduction of international news and a typographical tweaking of the briefing boxes. \"Definitely attached to this whole change to the front of the book was giving the 'International Report' a display page, a real opening,\" he says. \"The criticism I've heard is, 'We've got to plow through four pages until we get to the real news?' You know, plowing through four pages? I feel like I'd like to put together a little video that shows you how to turn two pages,\" Bodkin says. \"If you're not interested in that two-three feature, skip it.\" \"If you scan A1 and you read two and three, you've got an overview of any significant news event of the day,\" he adds. Getting that same \"taste\" would otherwise require flipping every page, \"which is less efficient.\" Bodkin isn't dismissive of the new look's critics, acknowledging that different readers have different styles of reading. His intent is to set out \"the thematic organization of the paper a little more aggressively. Which, again\u2014for the hardcore reader\u2014isn't all that important. But it's a big, complicated paper, and it helps to organize the paper.\" By the conclusion of our interview, Bodkin had talked me down from my ledge. I'm not sure Times readers want or need such a condensation, but having been given permission by the architect of the new welcome mat to ignore it, I'll do my best to coexist. ****** What do you make of the new summaries?

Whenever the economy starts to slide southward, the press starts sprouting horror stories spout about how \"tax revenue shortfalls\" are starving state governments. Today's (March 31) Washington Post [Page One](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/30/AR2008033002138_pf.html) piece\u2014\"States Are Hit Hard by Economic Downturn: Many Cutbacks Felt by Most Needy\"\u2014repeats so many of the genre's clich\u00e9s that the writers could have assembled the piece from memory. True to form, the Post leads its story with how \"cuts,\" \"shortfalls,\" and \"slashed\" budgets are depriving the needy of health care, requiring layoffs of state employees, and gutting after-school programs. Campgrounds are closing in Michigan, the Post reports. A city in New Jersey can no longer afford Independence Day fireworks. Some states have ended weekend hours at DMV offices. Untold in the Post story is how the state and local governments have increased their spending every quarter for the last four years, as the above chart, drawn from the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Affairs [data](http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=86&FirstYear=2005&LastYear=2007&Freq=Qtr), shows. The combined state and local number gives a better picture of government spending than the state-government figure alone. The states and localities routinely expanded entitlements, invented new programs, and spread more cash on their mainstays as growing tax revenue flowed in. Now, as the stumbling economy forces individuals and families to rein in their spending, it's only sensible that the state and local governments should have to tighten their belts. It's called living within your means. But news stories rarely reflect this sentiment. In the print edition of the Post (but not online), the paper reproduces a chart that it sources to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, which it correctly identifies as a liberal think tank. The chart, derived from this [CBPP document](http://www.cbpp.org/1-15-08sfp.htm), lays out the \"budget gaps\" projected by 22 states and the District of Columbia for fiscal year 2009 and three more in fiscal year 2010. That means, of course, that 25 states are not yet projecting budget gaps, which is the \"half full\" view of the glass. One would think that states living within their means would be of interest to Post readers, but we learn little to nothing about their fiscal practices. How many of the states constructed unreasonable or profligate budget projections? The Post doesn't say. The CBPP release is actually better than the Post on the half-full point, noting that mineral- and energy-rich states are experiencing tax \"revenue growth,\" as are agriculture states harvesting the big-money crops of corn and soybeans. Left unstated by the Post and the CBPP is the fact that some states\u2014such as Utah, North Carolina, and Georgia\u2014generally do a good job of matching tax revenues to expenditures. Others\u2014think California and Illinois\u2014build FUBAR fiscal houses whether the economy is booming or busting. Sounds like a story to me. State deficit \"crises\" are usually caused by government officials who fail to match their revenue projections to slow growing revenues. They dither instead of act because they regard shortfalls as a political problem to solve, not a financial one. Businesses executives, on the other hand, can't afford to dither because their company will go bankrupt (something states can't do) or they'll be sacked. When the states and liberal think tanks dictate the sky-is-falling angle in news stories, the press overstates the harm done by cuts to recipients of government largesse at the expense of the harm done to the average taxpayer who pays for the programs.

Curt Schilling's blog, [38 Pitches](http://38pitches.com/), offers an insider's take on life in the big leagues. The Red Sox starter (who'll miss the start of the season with a [shoulder injury](http://38pitches.com/2008/02/07/my-shoulder/)) loves the sound of his own keyboard, but there are rare insights here if you're willing to wade through the plugs for his [video-game company](http://38pitches.com/2008/03/05/congratulations-and-spring-training/).

The tobacco-chewing, headfirst-sliding Dykstra has, improbably, made a mint as a day trader and car-wash mogul. When he's not sucking down cheeseburgers and repeating the word bro, the ex-outfielder is busy putting together the Players Club, a new monthly publication that will educate professional athletes on money matters. \"This will be the world's best magazine,\" Dykstra tells writer Ben McGrath.

In [The Last Real Season](http://www.amazon.com/Last-Real-Season-Hilarious-Terrorized/dp/0446401544) (out in May), one-time Texas Rangers beat reporter Mike Shropshire chronicles baseball's 1975 campaign, the last season before full-scale free agency came into effect. Shropshire's no romantic, though: The Last Real Season is the sportswriter's Ball Four, a hilarious, profane diary of a year spent dodging punches from booze-infused Rangers manager Billy Martin and trying to wring copy out of a dead-end team. (My favorite excerpt from the author's 1975 clippings: \"[Rangers first baseman Jim] Fregosi is old enough to be somebody's grandfather, although, to the best of his knowledge, he's not.\") If you have only 15 minutes to spare, settle in with the stranger-than-fiction story of [Tony Gwynn Jr. and Trevor Hoffman](http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3243227). As ESPN the Magazine's Tom Friend explains, Gwynn, the son of Padres legend Tony Gwynn, grew up idolizing and palling around with Hoffman, his father's longtime teammate. In the final weekend of the 2007 season, the Padres called on Hoffman to get one final out to secure a spot in the playoffs. The man at the plate: the younger Gwynn, now a reserve outfielder with the Milwaukee Brewers. Even if you know what happens next, there's enough drama here to make your skin tingle. It's a welcome springtime reminder of the heartbreaks and triumphs that make baseball the world's greatest game. You don't look gullible, but you are. Year after year, the media take advantage of your naivet\u00e9 and humiliates you with an April Fools' Day prank. You're probably still kicking yourself for being fooled by the April 2000 Esquire feature about \" [Freewheelz](http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_kmesq/is_200004/ai_kepm171865),\" an Illinois startup that promised \"self-financing, free cars\" to consumers. Every time you spot Discover magazine on the newsstand, you growl because you fell for its April 1995 article about the discovery of the ice-melting, penguin-eating [hotheaded naked ice borer](http://ops.tamu.edu/x075bb/discover/fool95.html). Your father probably still gripes about Sports Illustrated's April 1, 1985, article about [Sidd Finch](http://www.bostonbaseball.com/whitesox/baseball_extras/sidd.html), the New York Mets prospect who could throw a baseball 168 mph. The [Museum of Hoaxes](http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/aprilfool/index) Web site catalogs these greatest hits to complete its Top 100 list of the greatest April Fool's hoaxes of all time. There's the BBC's legendary segment on the Swiss spaghetti harvest ( [1957](http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/1/newsid_2819000/2819261.stm)), Phoenix New Times' story about the formation of the \"Arm the Homeless Coalition\" ( [1999](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-04-01/news/give-piece-a-chance/)), and PC Computing's report on legislative efforts to ban the use of the Internet while drunk ( [1994](http://www.eff.org/Net_culture/Criticisms/unbelievable_slop.article)), just to name a few classics. April Fools' hoaxes succeed because the victims, conditioned by a stream of implausible but true stories in the press, aren't expecting the sucker punch. If you don't want to be anybody's fool this year, assume a guarded crouch, especially as the countdown to April 1 progresses. Some April Fools' Day pranks arrive in your mailbox a couple of days before the holiday in the form of a monthly magazine. Remember, to be forewarned is to be forearmed. Beware strange animals. If a story whiffs even remotely of the hotheaded naked ice borer, it's likely to be a hoax. [Technology Review](http://www.textfiles.com/humor/woolly_m.amm) hoaxed its readers with an April Fools' story in 1985 titled \"Retrobreeding the Woolly Mammoth.\" In 1984, the Orlando Sentinel did the same with a piece about the cockroach-devouring Tasmanian mock walrus. In 1994, London's Daily Star sports pages reported that invading superworms might destroy the Wimbledon green. Turn off your radio. Deejays love to pull practical jokes on April Fools' Day. In 1989, KSLX-FM in Scottsdale, Ariz., broadcast the claim that the station had been taken hostage by Pima Indians, prompting calls to the police. WCCC-AM/FM in Hartford, Conn., told listeners on April 1, 1990, that a volcano had erupted not far away. San Diego's KGB-FM alerted listeners on April 1, 1993, that the space shuttle Discovery had been rerouted from Edwards Air Force Base to a local airport. Thousands showed up to view the landing despite the fact that the spacecraft was earthbound that day. It's not just shock jocks pulling the pranks\u2014you can't trust NPR, either. Its \"humorists\" have aired pieces on portable zip codes you can take with you when you move ( [2004](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1805651)), federal health care for pets ( [2002](http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/features/2002/apr/pethealthcare/)), and advertisements projected onto the moon ( [2000](http://www.npr.org/programs/watc/features/2001/010401.lunar.html)). Shun the British press. The British tabloids make stories up all the time, but on April Fool's Day, everybody on Fleet Street fabricates. The Times used the day to run a spoof ad announcing an auction of \"surplus intellectual property\"\u2014various patents, trademarks, and copyrights. The Daily Mail announced the postponement of Andrew and Fergie's wedding because of a clash with Prince Charles' calendar. He was going to be butterfly-hunting in the Himalayas. The Daily Mail told readers that nuclear submarines were now patrolling the Thames. The Independent published a scoop about skirts for men at a fashionable shop. The Guardian declared it would replace the women's page with the men's page. In 2000, the Times complained that the surreal quality of the news\u2014Labor turning right wing, for example\u2014had taken the ease out of cracking a good April Fools' joke. If they pranked before, they'll prank again. In addition to the British press and NPR, the weekly chain formerly known as New Times Inc. (now Village Voice Media) loves to hoax its readers. Google has established a reputation for silly hoaxes with pages hyping its Google [MentalPlex](http://www.google.com/intl/en/mentalplex/) and [PigeonRank](http://www.google.com/technology/pigeonrank.html) technologies. It once posted openings for its [Googlelunaplex](http://www.google.com/jobs/lunar_job.html) office on the moon and introduced a smart-drink called [GoogleGulp!](http://www.google.com/googlegulp/) Too good to be true. News organizations sometimes fall for the April Fools' Day pranks perpetrated by outside hoaxsters, so don't expect every clue to be obvious. If an April 1 article declares that something valuable is now \"free\" or purports to break news about \"hidden treasure,\" you're being had. Does an organization's acronym or abbreviation spell April Fool? Also, scan copy for anagrams of \"April Fools'\" or some similar play on words. Discover's story on the hotheaded naked ice borer cited as its authority wildlife biologist \"Aprile Pazzo,\" which is Italian for April Fool. Alex Boese, curator of the Museum of Hoaxes and expert on all things April Fools', advises that you finish reading articles before rushing into the next cubicle to spread the incredible news. Many hoax articles end with an obvious clue or an explanation that it's all a joke. Double-check all radio warnings of disasters\u2014volcanic eruptions, floods, killer bee invasions\u2014and question any story uncovering a new, onerous tax (say, on [Linux](http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/01/1646201)). New-product announcements that arrive on or near April 1, such as the [left-handed Whopper](http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=39523), should be approached with skepticism, Boese says, but he cautions against reflexive hoax-spotting. On March 31, 2004, Google released the beta version of Gmail, which featured 1 GB of free storage, cavernous compared to other e-mail provider offerings. That was the same day the company unveiled its Googlelunaplex plans. The moon joke and the generosity of Gmail's 1 GB storage caused some nerds to sense a con and insist\u2014wrongly\u2014that Gmail was a giant April Fools' Day hoax. ****** For a GoogleGulp Alex [book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0156030837/qid=1127598203/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1?v=glance&s=books) Hippo Eats Dwarf: A Field Guide to Hoaxes Other B.S.

On Sunday night, boxer [ Floyd Mayweather made his pro-wrestling debut at Wrestlemania XXIV](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/arash_markazi/03/30/wrestlemania/). After a rote series of punches and chokeholds, Mayweather defeated his mammoth opponent, the Big Show, by resorting to the standard arsenal of dirty fighting: groin shots, brass knuckles, and that fail-safe weapon of the dastardly wrestler, the folding chair. Weeks of hype preceded the showdown, including spots on [Larry King](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM2iWM2NvPI) and [Conan O'Brien](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHNZU_FEIHc), with much of the time devoted to whether Mayweather was really [getting $20 million](http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-spw-mayweather26feb26,1,4818747.story). Whatever amount Mayweather took home, it was too much\u2014once the event was under way, it seemed like both men wanted it to be over. Why was the world's best pound-for-pound boxer wrestling in the first place? Pro wrestling might seem like an odd career move for a real fighter, but it wasn't a surprising development for boxing connoisseurs. Floyd Mayweather's foray into the world of turnbuckles and body slams is in keeping with a grand tradition that dates back to turn-of-the-century champs like [Ruby Robert Fitzsimmons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Fitzsimmons) and the great Jack Dempsey. The wrestling bug even bit the greatest fictional boxer of all time, Rocky Balboa, who took on Hulk Hogan (aka [Thunderlips](http://i3.photobucket.com/albums/y77/giverdonkey/thunderlips3-1-2.jpg)) in Rocky III. But the precedent that's most relevant to Mayweather's case is that of the Greatest of All Time. In 1976, Muhammad Ali [tangled with Japanese wrestler Antonio Inoki](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCWHcuXCLRo). The hypemen: Vince McMahon Sr. and Jr. of the World Wrestling Federation. In the past year or so, Floyd Mayweather has catapulted himself from mere boxing stardom to a level of pop-cultural notoriety that's quite rare for a fighter these days. In doing so, he's helped lift his entire sport out of the doldrums, all with an act that looks and sounds an awful lot like the one perpetrated by a young loudmouth from Louisville, Ky., named Cassius Clay. When Ali, then Clay, first emerged in the early 1960s, boxing's obituary was being written in the sports pages. Television had destroyed the subculture of local clubs, and the bland, unpopular Floyd Patterson had recently lost the heavyweight title to an even less popular fighter, glowering ex-con Sonny Liston. Beloved stars like Rocky Marciano and Sugar Ray Robinson were retired or in decline, and no bright lights were emerging to take their place. Enter Ali, riding his good looks, fast hands, and loquacious Louisville Lip to fame. This flamboyant shtick\u2014a charismatic young fighter reveling in the role of the cocky black braggart\u2014was a shot in the arm for the sweet science. In later years, Ali admitted that he stole large parts of his act, including the \"greatest of all time\" bit, from [Gorgeous George](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wagner), a legendary pro wrestler of the 1940s. Of course, for Ali, playing the self-adoring villain was a gesture of racial defiance as well as a promotional tactic. Now that he's been all but sainted, it's easy to forget how much of Ali's fame grew out of the fact that the white middle class hated him and tuned into his fights in the hopes of seeing the Louisville Lip buttoned once and for all. Floyd Mayweather courted a similar kind of infamy last May in his mega-fight with Oscar De La Hoya and in the behind-the-scenes series that HBO aired to hype it, 24/7. Though De La Hoya, boxing's pay-per-view king, was by far the marquee attraction going into the bout, Mayweather stole the show, positing himself as a new version of Ali updated for the hip-hop generation. \"I'm the greatest of all time\" morphed into \"I'm the richest of all time,\" and the Money May persona was born. With [50 Cent a regular companion](http://www.boxnews.com.ua/photos/1140/Oscar-De-La-Hoya-Mayweather35.jpg) in his ever-present posse, and with money-flinging and self-adulatory boasting his two favorite public activities, Mayweather donned the black hat of black defiance, selling his life, attitude, and style as a reflection of the values of the most banal rap videos. Just as it did for hip-hop, this gangsta lean pushed Mayweather's fights to the top of the charts. De La Hoya/Mayweather became one of the [most profitable events in pay-per-view history](http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN1039763320070510). The comparable success of Mayweather's bout with Ricky Hatton later in 2007 made it clear that it wasn't just Oscar who was responsible for all that cheddar. The lesson: If you want to open like Star Wars, you need a Darth Vader. The fans booed and hissed and rooted for his downfall, and just like Ali before him, Money May laughed all the way to the bank. Less than a year later, however, Mayweather already seems trapped inside a monster of his own making. The \"mo' money\" vaudeville act has gotten old fast, and Mayweather doesn't seem to know what to do with it. All he does seem to know is that he wants to be a superstar of the sort that boxing hasn't known since Sugar Ray Leonard, and to achieve that, he's getting admirably creative: [appearing on Dancing With the Stars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s4X2Tf5s9o), playing in the NBA Celebrity All-Star Game, regularly floating the idea that he'll turn away from boxing and pursue a career in mixed martial arts. And now Wrestlemania. It's as if he's trying to emulate both acts of the Ali drama at once\u2014the self-conscious villainy of the Louisville Lip era and the multiplatform cartoon character of the mid-1970s for whom boxing was only a small facet of a gigantic media creation. By the 1970s, Ali had transformed into the good guy. Thanks to a series of epic fights, the vindication of his position on Vietnam, and a genius for selling himself, the most loathed of heels became the hero of heroes and the face of a generation. To follow in those mighty footsteps, Mayweather has a long way to travel, indeed, and one has to wonder if circumstances and his own skill set ever will allow for such a metamorphosis. As a fighter, Floyd Mayweather is astonishingly gifted and deserves mention in Ali's exclusive class. But as far as charisma goes, Ali vs. Mayweather is a historic mismatch. The Greatest of All Time could play any role, going from villain to hero or clown to sage, sometimes in the space of a single rambling sentence. To this point, Mayweather hasn't demonstrated such dramatic range nor the depth and savvy it takes to emerge from a typecast villain into a full-fledged leading man. It's a trick that not even World Wrestling Entertainment could perpetrate on its fans. In the initial promotion for Mayweather's Wrestlemania appearance, he was positioned as the noble David in a David-and-Goliath showdown, defending the honor of the popular Rey Mysterio against the 7-foot Big Show. But there was a problem with this \"Floyd the Courageous,\" a plain fact repeated over and over again by various wrestlers and commentators\u2014nobody likes Floyd Mayweather. In the face of this realization, the WWE brain trust, never shy about tinkering with the forces of good and evil, recast the fighter in a darker but much more familiar light: the cocky braggart with a posse of thugs. And so it was Sunday night, the crowd roaring when it appeared that Big Show was going to finish Floyd, then booing when Floyd turned the tables and used some hastily produced brass knuckles to do the finishing himself. It was a bizarre and lackluster affair, and in that way warrants Floyd yet another comparison to Ali, whose wrestling bout with Antonio Inoki was [a lifeless travesty](http://www.thesweetscience.com/boxing-article/1716/joke-almost-ended-ali-career/). Of course, at that point Ali had earned himself a pass or two from the adoring public. That Mayweather wants such affection for himself is clear, but the way he's going about getting it isn't working. You'd think Mayweather, having stolen so readily from the Ali playbook, would understand that on history's stage only the bit players are bad guys. The big stars always play the good guy in the end. The traditionally slow-moving education industry is churning out a slew of students with specialties in \"mass catastrophe\" and \"international disaster.\" More than 200 colleges have created homeland-security degree and certificate programs since 9/11, and another 144 have added [emergency management](http://www.training.fema.gov/emiweb/edu/collegelist/) with a terrorism bent. Homeland security is outpacing most other majors in part because governments and corporations are hungry to hire professionals schooled in disaster. One-quarter of the top slots\u2014from presidential appointments to high-level civil servants to scientific posts\u2014at the Department of Homeland Security remained [empty](http://homeland.house.gov/SiteDocuments/20070413143439-12273.pdf) last year. And with one-third of posts at the Federal Emergency Management Agency [vacant](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/08/AR2007070801201_pf.html), thousands of graduates are landing lucrative government gigs before they've finished their weapons of mass destruction final. A student at the University of North Texas now works as an emergency planner in Florida when he's not tracking hurricanes for fun. A graduate of the University of Southern California's Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events is using his [dissertation](http://www.usc.edu/dept/create/news-and-events/february-3-2008.htm), rooted in game theory, to help police at Los Angeles International Airport improve inspections. Others are security directors on ships or bomb specialists at luxury hotels. DHS has doled out more than $300 million since 9/11 to eight prestigious U.S. universities to open \" [centers of excellence](http://www.dhs.gov/xres/programs/editorial_0498.shtm)\" devoted to narrow topics like \"the psyche of terrorists\" or \"microbial risk analysis.\" Though the funding is a pittance in federal-budget terms, the investment is a notable deposit into higher-education coffers and a forceful message to colleges: Build these degree programs and students will register. Universities, which recognize a good business venture and an admirable mission, have spent millions of dollars trying to enhance their offerings with electives on cybersecurity and agricultural terrorism. Thousands of military and law-enforcement experts have also enrolled in [certificate programs](http://www.training.fema.gov/EMIweb/edu/collegelist/dhscertificate/) to expand their expertise. Educators say terrorist training camps probably have rigorous curricula with hefty reading lists and hard-grading teachers. America could use an army of tech-savvy terror experts who have the smarts to thwart the next Chernobyl or to whip out an orderly evacuation plan when Katrina's sister arrives. It's fitting that the generation of American students that grew up with violent video games are the ones outsmarting the real villains. Rarely has an academic field swept through American campuses this quickly. When the Russians beat America into space in 1957 by launching [Sputnik](http://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/), the first unmanned spacecraft to orbit Earth, Washington helped universities respond. The federal bounty boosted college science and technology programs to counter the perceived intellectual threat from the Soviets during the Cold War. Physics and astronomy programs flourished. Products like ready-to-eat foods, no-fog ski goggles, and water-resistant clothing were born. The next time such a major academic shift whipped through university campuses, it was a product of rage rather than government investment. In the 1960s and '70s, students at colleges across the country rallied their schools to create African-American and women's studies majors to counter the prevailing white-male-dominated canon. The ballooning number of homeland-security and emergency-management majors must be making some campuses feel like Terror U. Homeland-security majors type out term papers on how to identify and outwit America's foes. The inevitability of disaster permeates every syllabus whether the threat is al-Qaida or avian flu. Students are learning lessons written by the same international security experts who also instruct ex-police-chiefs-turned-emergency-management consultants on how to respond to changing global threats. The [Center for Homeland Defense and Security](http://www.chds.us/), funded by DHS and FEMA, offers a free, ready-made curriculum to more than 130 universities. Packed with critical expertise, [the Naval Post Graduate School's curriculum](http://www.chds.us/?masters/curriculum) has been a hit with university leaders. Most schools use bits and pieces to flesh out their existing courses. The University of Connecticut copied it almost exactly. Universities say they are vigilant in making sure courses in every major are written and taught to entertain all points of view, however unpopular. But homeland security, which is a young academic discipline still developing its faculty, tends to be especially welcome territory for disaffected Bush administration officials who talk openly about bureaucratic hurdles to preventing disasters. A respected doctor enlisted to lead major disaster-response teams vented in one seminar about the \"inadequate\" and \"dangerous\" decisions made by DHS leaders. Lecturers with real-world know-how are in demand across campus. Since 9/11, professors in more established disciplines like international relations and criminal justice are taking time away from teaching students how to negotiate treaties or win legal arguments to quiz them on genetically engineered pathogens and dirty bombs. Other majors, studying everything from genetics to linguistics, are checking out homeland-security courses, too. Not since the space race have so many different disciplines abandoned their academic fiefdoms to collaborate. Emergency-preparedness and disaster-management classes might have geography majors and biologists, language majors and economists all dreaming about rescue scenarios in a mock situation room. An anthropologist might look at how culture makes people susceptible to foreign influence, while engineers look at a building's vulnerability to attack. Hopefully, these future spies, corporate disaster planners, and biohazard specialists will continue this multidisciplinary communication well past graduation. The question is, Will federal-government bosses listen to these young advisers? Experts on counterterrorism and weapons of mass destruction were sidelined before the Iraq war. The President's Commission on Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction [reported](http://www.wmd.gov/report/) to Congress in 2005 that former CIA Director George Tenet failed to pass along a senior intelligence officer's doubts about the presence of WMD to former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell before the Iraq invasion. The 2003 estimate on Iraq intelligence produced by then-CIA intelligence analyst [Paul Pillar](http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060301faessay85202/paul-r-pillar/intelligence-policy-and-the-war-in-iraq.html) found that a U.S.-led war against and occupation of Iraq would increase popular sympathy for terrorist goals. The government is encouraging people to gain academic credentials even after the establishment ignored advice from the existing experts after 9/11. It's hopeful to think that by helping to create an elite squad of terrorism-savvy graduates, some government officials may be trying to correct that mistake. Listening to a fresh cadre of professional paranoids could help prevent an anemic response to a natural or manmade disaster. Not only could that save agency bosses from literal danger and the bad press that follows a botched operation\u2014it could help them keep their jobs. I had just finished a Photoshop how-to for Wired when the software's maker announced a new free online version, [Photoshop Express](https://www.photoshop.com/express/landing.html). Great, I thought: Instead of telling readers to spend 100 bucks, I can point them to the free, no-installation-required version. After a few minutes of noodling, though, it was clear that Photoshop Express couldn't perform the basic vacation-shot-enhancement tricks I'd written up. Neither can [Picnik](http://www.picnik.com/) or [Phixr](http://www.phixr.com/), two other popular Web-based photo editors. As of yet, no Web-based photo manipulation tool is even as sophisticated as Photoshop Elements 5, the previous PC edition. Buy a copy on eBay for $40\u2014you'll thank me the next time your Web connection conks out. Photoshop Express is just one small example. There's now a flood of Web-based applications that serve as simplified\u2014read: limited\u2014versions of popular desktop software. Google Docs, the in-your-browser competitor to Microsoft Office that I [gushed about](http://www.slate.com/id/2156382/) a year ago, is probably the best example. Google just [announced](http://www.webware.com/8301-1_109-9906648-2.html) that its word processor, spreadsheet, and slide-show tools will soon let you keep working without a live network connection. That will remove their biggest shortcoming. Still, the more time I spend using Web-based apps like Google Docs, the more I appreciate my desktop computer. I used to be a network-computing zealot. I spent five years in the 1980s as a programmer and administrator for MIT's [Project Athena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Athena), an ambitious attempt to network the school's milewide campus. Plunk yourself in front of any Athena computer, type in your password, and all your stuff would be instantly available, just as if you'd plugged in a giant hard disk. I put in another five years at [NCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Computing_Devices), a Silicon Valley startup that tried to capitalize on some of Athena's principles. I thought that people who kept files on their desktops, and spent their days installing and upgrading application software, were idiots. Why not just have one copy of everything\u2014applications, files, etc.\u2014on the network, let the IT guys back it up for you, and connect to it from wherever you are? That's what Google Docs does, finally. But now that my youthful efforts have come to fruition, I've sworn off my [the-network-is-the-computer](http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan/entry/the_network_is_the_computer) evangelism for several good reasons. First, networks are flaky. Part of what makes the Internet so powerful is that, unlike an old analog phone line, it doesn't have to maintain a live, nonstop, real-time connection. As long as your mail gets transferred and Web pages download within a reasonable amount of time, you don't notice if your connection briefly goes down once in a while. If you're using that connection to edit photos, you do notice. One office network I use is shared by a few software engineers who regularly move gigabytes of data among servers. I can tell when they're at it, because my Photoshop Express session abruptly hangs between operations for a few seconds. Second, today's network apps run inside another application\u2014your Web browser. That makes them slower, and it limits the possibilities for the apps' user interface. The desktop version of Photoshop has a wonderful feature called the Magnetic Lasso that automatically finds the outline of a face as I drag the mouse roughly near its edges. I can wave my mouse sloppily around a human form, and the Magnetic Lasso will meticulously outline the human silhouette in my picture. That lets me punch up the color of a tourist in a photo or tone down ugly objects in the background. Photoshop Express will only let me adjust the entire photo at once. Google Docs is similarly crippled. Its slide-show editor has the same functionality of an early-1990s version of Microsoft PowerPoint and has just as many bugs in the way it formats text. I recently prepared a [presentation](http://valleywag.com/370014/how-to-write-for-your-companys-blog) for sharing online and spent more time fixing screwy indentation and mismatched font sizes than I did writing the words. Honestly, I don't know whether these are limitations on a browser interface or just plain bugs in Google's code. But that's a general problem with Web-based apps: There's a lower bar for perfection, probably because we're still in the \"Yay! It works in your browser!\" phase. Call me crazy, but I'll keep using PowerPoint until the browser-based solution is better than the one we've already got. The people who build browsers need to do a better job, too, if they expect me to do all my work inside one. Don't even get me started on the daily hell wherein I hit a Web site that locks up Firefox, killing all of my browser windows. If my desktop e-mail crashes, it doesn't shut down my photo editor. But when one browser-based app goes, they all go. Several times a week, I hit [Technorati](http://www.technorati.com/) to do a search and end up with Google Docs, Photoshop Express, and the rest of Web 2.0 stuck frozen on my screen. Even Microsoft Word doesn't crash that often anymore. In theory, Web-based apps\u2014also known as \"software as a service\" or, less precisely, \"cloud computing\"\u2014are the future of computers. That ignores the huge progress in personal computers that sit on your desktop, in your lap, or in your pocket. Multi-core processors, touch screens, [motion sensors](http://wii.nintendo.com/)\u2014all major computing advances, none of which are happening in the cloud. Consider the iPhone, a huge hit because of the things it does right there in your hand. It's a sharp-eyed camera with a killer photo-album tool you flip through with your fingertips, and it's a big music and video library you can play anywhere. You can't run applications like that over a network, and you won't be able to for a long time. I think there's a market for free, Web-based apps that offer basic features. Knock yourselves out, dilettantes. For me, it'll be years before Photoshop Express can become powerful enough to replace my desktop version, or before Google Docs gets me to uninstall Microsoft Office. I'm not sure I want to. One of the nice things about Word and Photoshop is that once I fire them up and start working, I can forget all about the Internet for a few hours. Sometimes, my PC and I just want to be alone. The hype for the fall TV season began early this year with the \"NBC Infront: Primetime 08/09 Upfront Presentation.\" There were many sound reasons for NBC to jump the traditional upfront week\u2014the mid-May period when broadcasters seduce $9 billion out of advertisers\u2014and they include the paralysis of the writers' strike, the emergence of a full-year programming schedule, the chance of more extensive product placements, and NBC's fourth-place ratings. Ben Silverman, co-chairman of NBC's entertainment division, called it \"a perfect storm,\" which is his favorite clich\u00e9. The fact of NBC's owning both the broadcast rights to the Beijing Olympics and the next Super Bowl? \"A perfect storm.\" Tina Fey's minting as a superstar? \"Perfect storm.\" These days, the operative question in Burbank and at 30 Rock is, What would a nor'easter do? To be sure, NBC's scaled-back presentation is disappointing on many levels. There are no clips to view, no actors or producers to chat with, no open bars to assault. But I've got liquor at home. Further, attending an upfront involves endless jostling with hundreds upon hundreds of rudely self-satisfied ad buyers, and the only jerk to deal with on yesterday's conference call was Silverman, a guy who recently labeled his peers at other networks graceless morons in the presence of Esquire's Matthew Belloni. Silverman seems to have instigated a glorious new era in executive-level trash talk, with a Fox programmer today telling Variety, apropos of NBC's plans for the fall, \"They're making grandiose statements. ... Everything they're saying now, they could say in May. The difference is, they're doing it with shows that don't exist.\" Those nonexistent shows represent the most uniformly escapist lineup of debuts in television history. The dramas include Knight Rider (as in KITT), Merlin (as in Camelot), Crusoe (as in Defoe and scheduled to air on Friday), The Listener (about a mind-reading paramedic, Bringing Out the Dead meets Medium), and My Own Worst Enemy (with Christian Slater as a soccer dad/superspy killing machine). Silverman described the hero of The Philanthropist as a cross between James Bond and Robin Hood, but I prefer to think of him as a hybrid of Bruce Wayne and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Then there's Kings, a modern-day retelling of David and Goliath starring Ian McShane. It represents, according to Bill Carter, \"a joint promotion with the Liberty Mutual insurance company. ... The themes of the show are meant to be consistent with Liberty Mutual's 'Responsibility Project.' \" You may recognize the Responsibility Project from those commercials\u2014\"Responsibility. What's your policy?\"\u2014depicting altruists engaged in such acts as helping short people reach things on high shelves and not running over dogs. On the reality-show tip, NBC will introduce Chopping Block, a restaurant show from the only chef in England with a temper worse than Gordon Ramsay's\u2014Marco Pierre White, of Quo Vadis, L'Escargot, and, once upon a time, Mario Batali's night terrors. But the man of the moment in the reality realm is Thom Beers, creator of such manful occupational odysseys as the History Channel's Ice Road Truckers and Discovery's Deadliest Catch. He'll be expanding the subgenre with Shark Taggers and America's Toughest Jobs. On the latter show, regular Joes will serially toil as loggers, wildcat oil drillers, and assistants to network executives. The new comedies include an Office spinoff, a pre-Election Day primetime run of a Saturday Night Live spinoff, and Molly Shannon's Kath and Kim. Regarding the last\u2014an adaptation of a mother-daughter laugh-fest from Australia\u2014Silverman mentioned having put Selma Blair through \"a Darryl Zanuck-type screen test,\" which struck me as odd. Though Zanuck, like many a mogul, viewed film of novice actors before offering them contracts, his most famous contribution to the casting process involved meeting would-be starlets on his couch 'round about 4 p.m. When I asked Silverman whether he meant that line as a joke about hooking up with his employees, he said, \"Ah, Slate, Slate. ... You deliver the highbrow every single time. I'll pass on your question.\" You brought it up, dude. In all likelihood, Silverman meant nothing at all and was just bullshitting. The Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Dana today quotes him likening himself to P.T. Barnum, who of course thought he knew how often suckers were born. And five, six, seven, eight: Dance shows continue to twirl across the airwaves at all angles\u2014an unprecedented outbreak of dipping and twisting, popping and locking, preening and pandering. Call it Terpsichore Vision and marvel at its adaptability. It's easy to imagine WE\u2014nominally a women's network, essentially a bridal channel\u2014whipping up Save the First Dance, in which affianced couples learn how to sway to \"Unchained Melody\" and \"What a Wonderful World\" while vying to win a honeymoon vacation. NBC, headquartered at Rockefeller Center, could confect Kick It: The Great Rockette Challenge. The Weinstein Company hasn't done much with the tiny arts channel Ovation since investing in it two years ago; if Harvey really wanted to build some buzz, he could hire Toni Bentley\u2014an alumna of the New York City Ballet and the author of [a literary memoir about butt sex](http://www.amazon.com/Surrender-Erotic-Memoir-Toni-Bentley/dp/B000BPG24W/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1207160892&sr=8-1)\u2014to combine those two passions by hosting a late-night reality competition titled Attitude Derri\u00e8re. While keeping your fingers crossed that such a day will come, you can tide yourself over with the likes of America's Best Dance Crew (MTV), produced by American Idol's Randy Jackson, hosted by former teen heartthrob Mario Lopez, and possessed of an unexpected sweetness. Here, the house style seems to derive from the martial stepping of black fraternities, the hectic posturing of music videos, and, when the lewdest competitors take the stage, humping a mailbox. The crews duel in a way that calls to mind the Sharks and the Jets. Last Friday's live finale found the team Status Quo (six inspiring kids from a rough neighborhood in Boston) matching off against JabbaWockeeZ (six kids from the West who managed to be inspiring despite performing in face masks fit for a slasher-film psycho). The JabbaWockeeZ triumphed. O frabjous day! Tears fell, and confetti, and the vanquished crews bounced back to the stage, extending their congratulations by forming a conga line, because the muse of Terpsichore Vision never guides anyone away from tackiness. Elsewhere, in a realm where hip-hop, Scream masks, and basic coordination are much less a presence, there is Your Mama Don't Dance (Lifetime, Fridays at 9 p.m. ET), hosted by former teen heartthrob Ian Ziering and produced by someone who knows the press-release value of alliteration: \"Now, five female dancers will be fox-trotting with their fathers while five male dancers will be doing the mambo with their mothers as they vie for praise from the judges and for America's votes.\" While the Oedipus and Electra complexes do not come up for discussion, the show nonetheless exists as a family-therapy session in 4/4 time, crafting behind-the-scenes narratives about support and acceptance and personal growth. The dad who was always at the office bonds with the daughter who was always at the barre, and so on. The judges, affectingly, take the greatest care to be gentle in their criticisms. The contestants, steadfastly, remain adorable even when looking like fools. The girls in the makeup department need to lay off the eye shadow. So it is that Step It Up and Dance (Bravo, premieres Thursday at 11 p.m. ET) enters a crowded field. None of the dance shows have any real sense of irony, and this will be the case until someone invents one focusing on the New Burlesque (to be hosted by downtown superstar Murray Hill, the grapefruit-shaped drag king in the polyester tux). But Step It Up and Dance attempts to distinguish itself by trafficking in irony's closest cousin, camp. The mistress of ceremonies is Elizabeth Berkley, who probably earned the job on the strength of her association with Showgirls, the third-worst film of the '90s (behind As Good As It Gets and Sliver). She's not so much a hostess as a hood ornament. One contestant, Miguel, introduces himself by touting his tenacity: \"It's like telling da Vinci, 'I'm sorry. You're not a good painter, you got to go.' \" Another, Nick, talks about enrolling in dance class after first viewing Footloose: \"At that age, I realized it was a good place to meet ladies.\" That age was 4. The season's likeliest breakout star is Jessica, an amateur cowed by the fact of competing with folks who list stints in Broadway musicals, on big-time pop tours, and atop go-go club pedestals on their CVs. She weeps when feeling proud of herself and flees to the wings when confused about her choreography, and what she lacks in self-confidence, she compensates for by not wearing very much clothing. That is, she wears about twice as much as do the pros on Dancing With the Stars (ABC), the program that's done so much to reshape the idea of the female back as an erogenous zone suitable for the family hour. To invert the Chorus Line lyric, Step It Up and Dance has a \"looks 10, dance 3\" air. The girls are pretty, and the boys are lithe. Watching the pilot, I found myself irked by the repeated play of the second-rate Spice Girls song to which the competitors were mastering steps, but I stayed glued, certain that everyone would start hooking up any second, such did they stretch and priss and thrust. It felt rather like staying too long at a cast party: The noisy and grating emotionalism of the actors intensifies as the hours pass, as does your belief that an orgy will break out. Self-aware, the show tosses out just enough tidbits about gender performance and the construction of sexual identity to divert a queer theory seminar at Brown for 20 minutes or so. For instance, a judge tells two female dancers to learn the distinction between dancing \"strongly\" and \"like a mean angry man.\" Later, Miguel\u2014the not-to-be-denied da Vinci\u2014receives instructions \"to butch it up a little bit more.\" \"Did I look like a fag?\" he asks in reply. Miguel's eyes indicate how receptive he is to constructive criticism. He is hungering to glide across the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, an Astaire in gold lam\u00e9. Thursday night on NBC, Late Night With Conan O'Brien was offering a rerun, and The Tonight Show With Jay Leno was offering Conan O'Brien. The self-deprecating absurdist has visited the folksy wisecracker many times before, but this appearance promised and delivered an especially odd vibe. It was a blip of inside-showbiz awkwardness. In 2004\u2014with the end of O'Brien's contract approaching and ABC batting its eyelashes at him\u2014NBC announced that O'Brien would ascend to Leno's swivel chair in 2009. But, for more than a year, there have been reports that the lame duck has quacked that he doesn't want to give up his gig. Last month, Bill Carter\u2014author of The Late Shift, the classic account of Leno's getting this job in first place\u2014reported that ABC and Fox were playing footsie with Leno. The piece quotes an anonymous suitor hoping that Leno will be motivated to seek \"revenge\" on the network that's laying him off after his many years of service at the observational-comedy mill. Thus, the quarter-hour Jay and Conan shared together had the potential to offer a special lesson in funnyman psychodynamics\u2014or at least a good workout for armchair analysts at 30 Rock and paranoids in Peoria. There was a slight chill in the studio air. The greeting was rote. Motions were gone through. I don't doubt that the two hosts share a personal relationship that's anything less than cordial. But before [these](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7149856011556288583) [clips](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2802418941617596636&q=leno+conan+video&total=743&start=0&num=10&so=1&type=search&plindex=1) get disappeared from YouTube, take a look and see if you think that the cordiality seems forced. Scan for signs of Leno\u2014who, in O'Brien's presence, never mentions that the anointed heir has indeed been anointed\u2014being passive-aggressive. \"So, you've been hosting the show,\" he queries. \"What other stuff have you been doing?\" Conan at one point told an anecdote about Jerry Lewis. Doing a gaily awful imitation\u2014a voice more Edith Bunker than nutty professor\u2014he passed along an inscrutable axiom that Lewis said he learned from Stan Laurel: \"Always do this. Tell the audience what you're going to do. Do it. And then tell them it has been done.\" Then, in his own voice, O'Brien pleaded, \"If anybody knows what the hell he's talking about, please tell me, because it's been ringing in my head for years.\" Leno responded, \"We should call Jerry and ask him.\" Well, this points to the essential friction of the evening: O'Brien getting a touch mock-hysterical in puzzlement at a comedic koan, Leno being stiff and clubby and patriarchal, none of us feeling terribly elegant. Slate contributor Fred Kaplan was online at Washingtonpost.com to chat about how the next president could [fix the military](http://www.slate.com/id/2187616/) and [repair U.S. foreign policy](http://www.slate.com/id/2187579/) after President Bush leaves office. An unedited transcript of the chat follows. Fred Kaplan: Fred Kaplan here. Glad to be back. Let's go to your questions. _______________________ Paris: Reading the article, one gets the impression that the only thing to be fixed in the foreign policy realm is the approach to the broader Middle East. What about multilateralism? Relationships with China and Russia? Getting the Transatlantic alliance back on track? Attention to Latin America? Stopping nuclear proliferation (e.g. India)? Fred Kaplan: Good question. (At least one other reader submitted a very similar one.) Three comments. First, I think the criticism is overstated. The first part of the piece, discussing general trends in international relations, and the last part, about the need for \"public diplomacy,\" apply to our foreign policy broadly. But you're right. I did focus perhaps inordinately on the Middle East. To that, I would say, second, I had only 1,200 words; there's only so much one can do. And third, realistically, the next president\u2014whoever he or she is\u2014is not going to be able to get a whole lot done unless some sort of solution, or coherent approach, is worked out on Iraq. That depends, in part, on a sensible policy toward Iran, Syria, and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. _______________________ South Range, Wis.: Is it possible to fix U.S. soft power without fixing the corporate control that has come to dominate every aspect of American culture, in particular the media? Can the world still differentiate between American values and corporate policy? Fred Kaplan: Yes, I think it is possible. The United States Information Agency was just such an instrument all through the Cold War, when arguably corporate control of American society and politics was far more pervasive than it is now. _______________________ Jacksonville, Fla.: Four part question here: How much of the military spending problems (unnecessary extravagant carriers, fighter jets, etc.) are because of the fact that they support the military-industrial complex of highly connected contractors? Can this problem be corrected without harming a now huge part of the American economy? Would any president be willing to take on this risk? How could they manage this collateral damage? Fred Kaplan: Good question. I think the Military-Industrial Complex is sometimes an overrated factor, but it's often an underrated factor as well. (You would be hard-pressed to find references to it, or to a euphemism for the same phenomenon, in mainstream newspaper articles.) It's worth recalling that it was a great general, Dwight Eisenhower, who first uttered the phrase and warned of its dangers. But it's not just industry. It's also congressional districts (for a half-century now, the services have sagely distributed contracts and subcontracts for controversial weapons systems to as many districts as possible, the better to build up legislative support). It's also the stranglehold that certain subcultures within the services have over the weapons-procurement process. For instance, the #1 priority of the Air Force these days is the F22 fighter jet\u2014perhaps the only airplane that has not been used in any of the wars we've fought lately. Why? Because the Air Force procurement machinery is still dominated by fighter pilots. Ditto for the Navy and aircraft carriers (and submarines), the Army and tanks. A rethinking of the role of military power in the post-Cold War world might overhaul these priorities. But as long as the politics of the services remain the same, little is going to happen. _______________________ Plano, Texas: Do the liberals at Slate get angry when good news comes out of Iraq? Are all of you mad now that it looks like Iraq is on it's way to becoming a stable democracy? Fred Kaplan: Let me ask you a question: Do you really believe the premise of your question? Do you really think we jump for joy with each report of a suicide bomb going off? Do you really believe that we want to see the Middle East remain in the hands of authoritarians or Islamic fundamentalists? If you've read my columns over time, you may have noted that I have expressed hope\u2014increasingly cautious hope, but hope nonetheless (not dismay)\u2014when trends seem, even slightly, to be going our way. I would question, by the way, your premise that Iraq is \"on its way to becoming a stable democracy.\" What papers do you read? I should also add that some writers at Slate\u2014for instance, my colleague and old friend Christopher Hitchens\u2014are unequivocal in their support for the war. _______________________ Stop-truth-decay : I can justify high tech weapons in one word: China. Fred Kaplan: Well, that IS the rationale. If someone had fallen asleep in say 1985, woken up today and looked at the defense budget, he (or she) would infer that the Cold War must still be going on. Look at the budget. About $600 billion\u2014NOT including the money spent on Iraq, Afghanistan, and \"the longer war on terror.\" What is that $600 billion going for? Well, a lot of it is for people. But much of the rest is for aircraft carriers, submarines, fighter jets\u2014remnants of the Cold War. What threat today is best answered by lots of such weapons? There is no such threat. Ah, but 20 years down the road, many say, China MIGHT emerge as a great military power, and these weapons will be necessary to deter or fight China. Two replies: First, China's military power is strengthening, but it still doesn't amount to much. (Do me a favor and click on a [Slate column](http://www.slate.com/id/2141966/) I wrote a while back, detailing the contents of a Pentagon report on the military power of the People's Republic of China. An interesting document: The first half tries to raise your hair by describing all the things China seems to be wanting to do. The second half calmly notes how far away they are from succeeding at any of these ventures.) Second, to the extent China wants to dominate the world, I think they're on track BUYING the place. We need to devote more attention to trade policy if we want to stave off China. _______________________ Clifton, Va.: Bubba, has there been a terrorist attack in the U.S. since Sept. 11? No. Do I care what the rest of the world thinks about our military and foreign policy? No! What is most important is this country's national security and protecting U.S. citizens. I dont care what the rest of the world thinks. If anything, we need to spend more money on covert ops and chasing tangoes! If we are unlucky and Obama or Clinton wins in November 2008, then be prepared for ten of thousands of deaths from terrorist attacks here in the U.S. Dick Cheney is right! So! Fred Kaplan: Hmm. The dollar's going down, our deficit and debt are spiraling out of control, we have a hard time maintaining 150,000 troops in Iraq and another 30,000 or so in Afghanistan. And you don't care what the rest of the world thinks of us. How are we going to lure allies to join our causes and contribute to our defense\u2014yes, our defense (and our national-security interests abroad)? This is not a gooey liberal question. It's a very hard-headed one. We do not have the money, the manpower, or the stomach to do the things you would like us to do all by ourselves. Meanwhile, because the Soviet Union\u2014the common enemy that held the Western alliance together\u2014no longer exists, our erstwhile allies have realized they can go their own way, pursue their own interests, without much regard for what Washington thinks. We have no choice but to pursue allies\u2014not at the expense or sacrifice of our vital interests or bedrock principles, but with active diplomacy, which sometimes mean tactical compromises. _______________________ curiousgemini: What Carter and Kaplan forget is that a lot of these expensive cold war era weapons put a lot of money in defense contractors' pockets. These companies lobby hard and have close connections to the Pentagon. Also, many members of Congress have a political stake in the jobs these bloated programs create in their districts. This is all part of the \"Military-Industrial-Congressional complex.\" Fred Kaplan: Well, we don't exactly \"forget\" these facts. We spend a lot of time in our essay coming up with ways to deal with them, to form semi-rational policies despite these obstacles. Take another look. You're right, though: it's a very serious problem, especially at a time when we need to overhaul the military structure, if we're to retain our solvency and recover much of our influence. _______________________ Orion838: Good ideas, but unlike what the authors suggest, Congress doesn't just sit around and passively go along with Pentagon plans to buy Cold War relics like aircraft carriers, nuclear subs, high tech fighter planes, etc. Congress mandates that these purchases must be made, even when the Pentagon would prefer to spend the money elsewhere. The reasons are job for constituents and campaign contributions from defense contractors. Given these congressional priorities, it's hard to see how we can ever find the money the authors show is needed. Fred Kaplan: You're right\u2014sort of. Many times, the Pentagon or one of the services will put forth a budget that cuts, even slashes, some of these much-cherished weapons systems\u2014KNOWING that Congress will restore the budget fully, if not more. There's gamesmanship all round. _______________________ Sun Prairie, Wis.: Mr. Kaplan: I noticed that your brief piece in Slate did not address the absurdly long time it takes to design, test and arrange for production of weapons systems and other defense platforms, or the added costs and security risks involved in having their production spread across the country instead of concentrated in a few places. I recognize that both these problems are to some extent imposed by Congress, but it's unlikely that we will get a more effective, less expensive military by ignoring them\u2014meaning that at some point a President will need to confront Congress. Do you agree? washingtonpost.com: [GAO Blasts Weapons Budget](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/31/AR2008033102789.html) (Post, April 1) Fred Kaplan: This is a serious\u2014and very old\u2014problem. If the president wanted to order the cancellation of, say, a big fighter-aircraft program\u2014or wanted to defer production of another $3.2 billion aircraft carrier\u2014we would have to pay enormous delay or cancellation costs. Weapons contracts, quite reasonably, are loaded with these clauses. Then a defender of one of those weapons programs would argue: If we cancel this program, we will lose the skilled work force, we will lose the industrial base; if we want to manufacture it sometime in the future, there may not be the laborers\u2014there may not be the corporation\u2014to make it. For this reason, a lot of officials and legislators who have a lot of other things on their mind simply let it go; it's a fulltime job, plus some, to tangle with these obstacles. But for this same reason, somebody's going to have to do it, at some point, before the excess costs and anachronistic allocations send us into the poorhouse and wreck the army. _______________________ Bethesda, Md.: \"Bubba, has there been a terrorist attack in the U.S. since Sept. 11?\" Hey, Clifton, I've got one word for you: anthrax. So, yes, there has been. Fred Kaplan: I don't think it's at all clear that the anthrax scare was a terrorist attack. We don't know where the stuff came from. I seriously doubt it was some foreign terrorist group\u2014or if it was, the leaders must have given it up as an ineffectual approach: it killed very few people, sired panic but not of the sort that damaged our economy in the slightest; in any case, it has not recurred. Not to be complacent, but still... _______________________ kenl77: In regard to the Cold War era, the author says the following: \"The world was dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union, and the countries in between often subordinated their own interests to accommodate\u2014in the West by choice, in the East by force\u2014the interests of their superpower protector.\" It seems to me that American history since 1945 involved a substantial amount of coercion, ranging from flat-out declaration of war to CIA subversion of governments and elections, assassination of foreign leaders, support of ruthless dictators and economic destruction of third-world countries. To believe that somehow the United States was the good guy in the Cold War is another fable that Americans must shed before they ever can understand why they so roundly are hated in much of the world. Fred Kaplan: I think you're misreading what I wrote, a bit. Or maybe I should have elaborated more fully (though I have in other columns and, even more, in my new book, Daydream Believers: How a Few Grand Ideas Wrecked American Power\u2014hey, I have to get a plug in here somehow). I'm not saying that we were \"the good guy in the Cold War\" (though our sins were far less heinous than the Soviet Union's, I think it's reasonable to say\u2014we did not suppress our European allies in the same way that Moscow suppressed, absolutely controlled, theirs, for instance). My point was this: During the Cold War, many Western (and in-between) nations subordinated their own interests in order to accommodate ours. In some cases this was not voluntarily; in other cases, as you point out, less so. Now, with the Cold War over and the common enemy vanquished, many of these countries are pursuing their own intersts again. My point is that the Bush administration's initial premise\u2014that we are \"the sole superpower' and therefore can do pretty much anything we want, and we don't need allies to do it\u2014is completely wrong. In a very important way, we are less powerful than we used to be, less able to get our way without trying much; the whole concept of \"superpower\" is obsolete. _______________________ Washington: Thanks for your columns\u2014I have found them quite interesting. Any word on how the Central Command position will be filled? Is there any credence to the rumor that it will be Petraeus, with Odierno going to replace him at Multi-National Force Iraq? Fred Kaplan: Thanks. I've read the same rumors you have. They seem plausible. But I have no inside dope on what's for real\u2014and it may well be that no more than a half-dozen people do. _______________________ U.S.: I'm very troubled by the extensive use of stop-loss orders and involuntary recalls of people who thought they'd gotten out of the military. While I realize military people signed on the dotted line, the use of these provisions in this way seems to me to be a clear violation of the spirit of the law. Are any plans being made to avoid this situation in future conflicts? Fred Kaplan: I agree with you, but I see no end to it as long as the military doesn't have any other way to keep the level of troops that the political leadership (i.e., the president) wants to keep deployed\u2014especially in Iraq. And currently, there is no other way. Recruitment targets are being met only by lowering standards to perilous levels. Junior officers are getting out of the service in droves. This is why a lot of general officers are eager to find some way to cut our losses in Iraq\u2014they fear that the Army might wind up broken. _______________________ Rockville, Md.: Regarding terrorist attacks, what about the Washington sniper, who roamed around the city for a month killing people at random? The entire city was paralyzed with fear. I guess if it's not al-Qaeda or people with brown skin, we don't consider that a \"terrorist attack.\" Fred Kaplan: In fairness, the phrase \"terrorist attack\" usually implies foreign involvement. (Didn't the sniper have brown skin?) _______________________ Tyrtaios-rising: Would it surprise anyone to know our embassies and consulates, worldwide, are where they are to represent our economic interests? What are those interests? Certainly not catering to distraught American tourists, much to many's chagrin. A posting by cbarrett on The Fray discussed an interesting issue: oil and our foreign dependence on it. It consumes us, we are held hostage by it and the competitive world demand for it. Everything else, the Palestine issue, proper dialogue with key players, not just in that region, but within our own hemisphere, let alone Africa. Something not lost on the Chinese incidentally. Have you been to Port Harcourt, Nigeria, recently? Would it surprise you to learn a lot of petroleum and natural gas exports come from there to us? Our foreign policy extends to the use of military force projection in enforcing an outline called the Carter Doctrine. Look it up and draw conclusions why we focus so much on the Middle East. What are our future economic priorities going to be? That will drive our foreign policy. In many cases, the use or misuse of our military strength as a form of foreign policy as well. Which future president has even hinted at addressing our dependence on foreign oil? I'm aware it's more complicated then that. But it's a start. Fred Kaplan: As you say, it's \"more complicated\" than oil (and other resources), but certainly that's a large part of it. Most wars over the centuries have had something to do with resources. You're certainly right in your main point\u2014(a) that weaning our dependence on foreign oil should be regarded as a vital national-security priority and (b) that no politicians are talking about this very much. _______________________ wayhey1: Is it too much to expect the current president to do all of these things that Kaplan suggests? Bush still has time left in office to get the ball rolling. Of course, to regain other nations' trust he actually would have to admit to making mistakes. As a graduate of a 12-step-type recovery program, he should understand this better than most\u2014yet he hasn't shown any inclination to apply life's important lessons to foreign policy, and that is disappointing. Machismo and claiming infallibility is the opposite of diplomacy, as well as the opposite of personal healing. In that same vein, Fred said one thing I just can't let go by without making a comment: \"The world was dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union, and the countries in between often subordinated their own interests to accommodate\u2014in the West by choice, in the East by force\u2014the interests of their superpower protector.\" This is a myth that has gone on far too long. Western Europe went along willingly with the United States\u2014thanks in large part to the Marshal Plan, in my opinion\u2014but the same is not true of many other U.S. allies during the Cold War. Coercion and CIA-sponsored coups were used all over Latin America and the Middle East as tools to build anti-Communist alliances. The continued refusal to face this reality and own up to past expediencies fuels her current enemies and weakens her internally. Any president admitting to these facts would disarm many of America's most vocal and most radical opponents, and America would emerge again as the great model to which other nations aspire. Fred Kaplan: Good point. I would say two things, though. First, Europe was the centerpiece of our Cold War policy. Second, as for the other countries, many of their governments went along with us by choice\u2014though it's certainly the case that some of those governments were installed or bought off. I may have used the phrase \"by choice\" too cavalierly. _______________________ Seattle, a military town: Given the massive outsourcing to Blackwater and other nonmilitary \"contractors\" by the Bush misadministration\u2014usually at triple or quadruple pay\u2014is it likely we can fix our military, given how much of its hardware has been chewed up in Iraq and the lack of noncontractor resources? And do you think this was a plan by Red China that Bush and McCain enabled with the help of John Yoo and other plants? Fred Kaplan: I think we'll be seeing much less involvement by contractors in the near future. Don't think that reduced contracting will save us money. Somebody has to do the jobs that the contractors have been doing. Where are we going to get these people? As for the Red China plot: No. _______________________ aix42: The U.S. must admit its use of torture and apologize. It must stop use of black sites and Guantanamo and the ridiculous notion of \"unlawful enemy combatants.\" The people of the U.S. also need to become fully aware of how the actions of the U.S. against other nations of the world have hurt many people and have caused great animosity toward this country. Fred Kaplan: OK, but then what do we do after the self-flagellation. I don't mean to minimize the point. This IS a basic prerequisite to boosting our image and restoring much of our power\u2014which, as I point out in the Slate column, amount to much the same thing (if done properly). _______________________ Nike: An even better idea! Instead of squandering the wealth of the nation down one black hole after another in the Middle East, why not spend that cash on education, building roads, health care, reducing the deficit, etc.? Nah, forget it. How would helping Americans serve the cause of the war pigs? God bless America. Fred Kaplan: Just curious: \"black holes\" aside, are you opposed to any US activity overseas? _______________________ Seattle: No politicians are talking about the foreign implications of oil dependency? Last time I checked, both Obama and Clinton were talking directly about it\u2014and we here in the 17 states dealing with global warming are doing something about it, with people like me buying 100 percent green power from Seattle City Light from wind, solar and hydro, for example, and all made in America! Half of war is economics\u2014so, is not the major threat the Red Chinese taking global oil, coal and mineral resources worldwide while we dither? Fred Kaplan: I think you're right. Thomas Friedman had a fascinating story in the NY Times Magazine several months ago about U.S. firms manufacturing energy-saving devices\u2014large-scale devices\u2014explicitly for export to the Chinese market. This is another way to go. _______________________ Fred Kaplan: That's all, folks. Thanks for the lively forum. I recently returned from an extended stay in Europe, where most new cars run on diesel. Those cars are typically a lot more fuel-efficient than our gas guzzlers, which makes me wonder why there aren't more diesels on American roads. I know that diesel has a reputation for causing dirtier tailpipe emissions than petrol, but isn't that a bygone problem? Technological wizardry has, indeed, made diesel-powered vehicles vastly cleaner than in olden days. As a result, lots of gearheads are touting diesels as finally safe enough for American motorists, who will dig the cars' impressive fuel-economy numbers. There's considerable excitement on these shores, for example, over the impending arrival of the [2009 Volkswagen Jetta TDi](http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/automotive_news/4235586.html), a \"clean diesel\" vehicle that purportedly gets 50 miles per gallon on the highway yet spews out far less soot than the diesels of yore, which wreaked havoc on air quality. So will the erstwhile environmental boogeyman of diesel fuel end up saving us all? The Lantern is still far from convinced. [Diesel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel#Petroleum_diesel), named after German engineer [Rudolf Diesel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Diesel), has traditionally been simpler to refine than gasoline, although making it also requires more crude oil per gallon. The end result is a fuel that boasts much greater energy density than gasoline, which explains why diesel cars get up to 40 percent more miles per gallon than their petrol counterparts. The higher energy density also means that burning a gallon of diesel emits more greenhouse gases than burning a gallon of gasoline\u2014about 15 percent more, to be specific. But due to the appreciable fuel-economy savings, diesel cars usually emit less of these gases per mile driven. There's a more disturbing difference between diesel and gasoline: Burning diesel also emits [nasty particulates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_particulate_matter) and smog-forming nitrogen oxides, as should be apparent to anyone who's ever gotten a mouthful of bus or tractor exhaust. The good news is that today's diesel contains significantly less sulfur than in years past, resulting in much less harmful soot. On top of that, new diesel cars are outfitted with ingenious emissions-control systems such as [BlueTec](http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/hot_lists/car_shopping/green_machines/bluetec_the_brand_car_news), which treats exhaust with a urea-based solution to reduce its toxicity. But these improvements have come with costs. According to the [Union of Concerned Scientists](http://www.ucsusa.org/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/dieseldilemma_fullreport.pdf) (PDF), manufacturing a gallon of the new, low-sulfur diesel requires even more crude oil than the old diesel. Also, diesel engines are more complicated than petrol engines and thus require more energy and materials to manufacture. Still, a diesel car's improved fuel economy can offset these drawbacks. The UCS recommends that car shoppers revise a diesel vehicle's miles-per-gallon rating downward by 20 percent in order to get a more accurate picture of the overall impact on oil consumption. Fans of the forthcoming Jetta TDi point out that the car's tailpipe emissions are clean enough to pass muster in California, a state with exceptionally tough emissions regulations. Yet the diesel TDi still lags behind many other vehicles that meet California's stringent requirements, including the [gas-powered 2008 Jetta](http://www.driveclean.ca.gov/en/gv/vsearch/cleansearch_result_des.asp?vehicleid=315), which qualifies as a [partial zero-emissions vehicle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZEV). The relative dirtiness of even the most advanced diesels worries some researchers, who argue that the resulting soot (which they term \"black carbon\") may be a [key factor in global warming](http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2008/2008-03-23-03.asp). According to a [2002 Stanford University study](http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/02/jacobsonJGR1023.html), even if all diesels were designed to meet California's emissions standards, diesel cars could still warm the globe more than petrol cars over the next half-century. None of this is to imply that gasoline is necessarily more eco-friendly than diesel\u2014the two fuels just have different pluses and minuses. European regulators seem to care more about reducing the continent's greenhouse-gas emissions than its particulate emissions and so have favored policies that prop up diesel. As you probably learned during your foreign sojourn, diesel is cheaper than petrol in virtually all of Europe, largely due to its being more lightly taxed (though [maybe not for long](http://www.neurope.eu/articles/84192.php)). The opposite is true here in the United States, where diesel tends to [cost significantly more](http://www.eia.doe.gov/bookshelf/brochures/diesel/) than regular gasoline\u2014in part because our new, low-sulfur diesel is more expensive to manufacture, but also because of a higher federal per-gallon tax. The wild card here is the ongoing development of [biodiesel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiesel), which can drastically reduce a diesel vehicle's tailpipe emissions. Perhaps more importantly, it can also be made from domestic crops: In the United States, the chief source is soybeans, while Europeans prefer canola. To calculate the environmental benefit of biodiesel is a complex task and one the Lantern hopes to accomplish in an upcoming column. Simply put, though, [not all biodiesels are created equal](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/15/business/worldbusiness/15biofuel.html): Some may require too much production energy and arable land to justify the effort from an environmental standpoint. We can hope that a number of well-done life-cycle analyses of biodiesel are in the works, so we'll soon know whether Malaysian palm is the future. In the meantime, though, the Lantern looks forward to test-driving the 2009 Jetta TDi\u2014not only because it's supposedly a great ride but also to determine whether Volkswagen is telling the truth about those fuel economy figures. After all, wasn't the Toyota Prius supposed to get 60 miles per gallon in the city? The Lantern's alter ego could [barely get more than 50](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.04/hybrid.html).

New General Manager Tuesday, April 1, 2008 [Danger Is My Middle Name:]() Outgoing Senator Larry Craig can take consolation in one thing: out in Idaho, everyone wants his seat. Fourteen candidates have filed to run for the Senate, including [eight Republicans, two Democrats, two Independents, and a Libertarian](http://www.idahostatesman.com/election/story/330618.html). Hal Styles Jr. of Desert Hot Springs, California, entered the Republican primary, [even though he has never been to Idaho](http://www.kmir6.com/NewsArticle/tabid/1294/xmid/20272/Default.aspx). \"I know I'll love it because, clean air, clean water and many, many, many mountains,\" he says. \"My heart, my mind, my body, my soul, my thoughts are in this to win.\" The general election will likely be a rematch between former Democratic congressman [Larry LaRocco](http://www.laroccoforsenate.com/) and Republican Lt. Gov. (and former governor) [Jim Risch](http://www.risch4idaho.com/). If Idahoans find those two insufficiently embarrassing, however, a number of fringe candidates have lined up to take Craig's place. According to [CQ](http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5&docID=news-000002693802), one Independent, Rex Rammel, is a former elk rancher who is angry that Risch ordered state wildlife officials to shoot some of his elk that got away. The Libertarian, Kent A. Marmon, is running against \" [the ever-expanding Socialist agenda](http://marmonforidaho.com/kents_blog)\" he claims is being pushed by Democratic congressmen like John Dingell. But by far the most creative third-party candidate is Marvin Richardson, an organic strawberry farmer who went to court to change his name to \"Pro-Life.\" Two years ago, he made that his middle name and tried to run for governor as Marvin \"Pro-Life\" Richardson. State election officials ruled that middle names couldn't be used to make a political statement on the ballot. As plain old Marvin Richardson, he won [just 1.6% of the vote](http://www.idsos.state.id.us/ELECT/RESULTS/2006/general/tot_stwd.htm). Now that \"Pro-Life\" is his full name, the state had to [let him run that way on the ballot](http://www.idahopress.com/news/?id=4623). He told the Idaho Press-Tribune that with the name change, he should win 5%. He plans to run for office every two years for as long as he lives: \"If I save one baby's life, it will be worth it.\" As the Press-Tribune points out, Pro-Life is not a single-issue candidate, but has a comprehensive platform. In addition to abortion, he opposes \"homosexuality, adultery, and fornication.\" He wants the pro-life movement to refer to abortion as \"murder,\" although he has not yet insisted pro-choice candidates change their name to that. Idaho Republicans and anti-abortion activists don't share Pro-Life's enthusiasm. They worry that conservative voters will check the box next to both Pro-Life and the Republican candidate, thereby spoiling their ballots. So last week, the Idaho Secretary of State persuaded both houses of the legislature to pass [emergency legislation](http://www3.idaho.gov/oasis/S1514.html) to clarify that \"voters are casting a vote for a person and not a political proposition.\" Under the legislation, candidates who appear to have changed their names to \"convey a political message\" will be outed on the ballot as \"a person, formerly known as ....\" The Prince Bill will go to the governor for signature this week. According to the Associated Press, Pro-Life accuses legislators of \" [trying to legislate intelligence](http://64.233.169.104/search?q=cache:4PvT4rQMstMJ:www.journalnet.com/articles/2008/03/26/news/breaking/news03.txt+marvin+richardson+legislate+intelligence&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=1&gl=us&client=firefox-a)\"\u2014a charge not often hurled at the Idaho legislature. \"The people that vote for me are more intelligent than to have something defined in legislation like this,\" he says. Of course, Idahoans who really want to make a political statement will still be able to outsmart the Prince Bill. Nothing in the legislation prohibits Idaho parents who feel strongly about issues from naming their children Pro-Life or Pro-Gun at birth. For that matter, Marvin Richardson has changed his name so many times that if he changes it again, the ballot might have to describe him as \"a person formerly known as 'Pro-Life.'\" Or he could just change his name to Mitt Romney. On the other hand, Republicans and Democrats alike can breathe a sign of relief over another unintended effect: the new law foils Larry Craig's best strategy for a comeback. Before the law, Craig could have changed his name to \"Not Gay\" and won in a landslide. \"A person formerly known as Not Gay\" is more like it. ... 5:27 P.M.

This year, Okay, folks, here's the deal: We need to fill precisely 4.22 column-inches of type with information about the faceless, tasteless Pirates, and as usual we're not sure we can do it. But guess what? We're already at .95 inches, and we're just getting started! Wait\u2014make that 1.19 inches. ... Should they finish below .500 again (and let's be honest, how can they not?), they will tie the Phillies of 1933-48 for the most consecutive losing seasons. (By the way, that's 3.53 inches, and we haven't even had to mention new manager John Russell, Capps's promise as a closer or the vast potential of the Snell-Gorzelanny duo.) There: 4.22 inches. Piece of cake.\" So now the Pirates even hold the record for consecutive seasons as victims of the same bad joke. Pittsburgh faces all the challenges of a small-market team. Moreover, as David Maraniss pointed out in his lyrical biography, Seven years ago, in a desperate bid to revive the Pirates' fortunes, the city built PNC Park, a gorgeous field with The result? As Pittsburgh writer Don Spagnolo noted last year in \" Although the Pirates' best player, Jason Bay, is from Canada, if Pittsburgh fans have suffered because of trade, the blame belongs not to NAFTA but to an inept front office.

( Wednesday, Mar. 5, 2008 [All the Way:]() As death-defying Clinton comebacks go, the primaries in Ohio and Texas were very nearly not heart-stopping enough. On Monday, public polls started predicting a Clinton rebound, threatening to spoil the key to any wild ride: surprise. Luckily, the early exit polls on Tuesday evening showed Obama with narrow leads in both do-or-die states, giving those of us in Clinton World who live for such moments a few more hours to stare into the abyss. Now that the race is once again up for grabs, much of the political establishment is dreading the seven-week slog to the next big primary in Pennsylvania. Many journalists had wanted to go home and put off seeing Scranton until [The Office](http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=6adda763-49df-4bfa-8296-f156094bf0ce) returns on April 10. Some Democrats in Washington were in a rush to find out the winner so they could decide who they've been for all along. As a Clintonite, I'm delighted that the show will go on. But even if I were on the sidelines, my reaction would have been the same. No matter which team you're rooting for, you've got to admit: We will never see another contest like this one, and the political junkie in all of us hopes it will never end. It looks like we could get our wish\u2014so we might as well rejoice and be glad in it. A long, exciting race for the nomination will be good for the Democratic Party, good for the eventual nominee, and the ride of a lifetime for every true political fan. For the party, the benefits are obvious: By making this contest go the distance, the voters have done what party leaders wanted to do all along. This cycle, the Democratic National Committee was desperate to avoid the front-loaded calendar that backfired last time. As [David Greenberg](http://www.slate.com/id/2185831/) points out, the 2004 race was over by the first week of March\u2014and promptly handed Republicans a full eight months to destroy our nominee. This time, the DNC begged states to back-load the calendar, even offering bonus delegates for moving primaries to late spring. Two dozen states flocked to Super Tuesday anyway. Happily, voters took matters into their own hands and gave the spring states more clout than party leaders ever could have hoped for. Last fall, NPR ran a whimsical story about [the plight of South Dakota voters](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15512594), whose June 3 contest is the last primary (along with Montana) on the calendar. Now restaurateurs, innkeepers, and vendors from Pierre to Rapid City look forward to that primary as Christmas in June. But the national party, state parties, and Sioux Falls cafes aren't the only ones who'll benefit. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the biggest beneficiaries of a protracted battle for the nomination are the two contestants themselves. Primaries are designed to be a warm-up for the general election, and a few more months of spring training will only improve their swings for the fall. And let's face it: These two candidates know how to put on a show. Both are raising astonishing sums of money and attracting swarms of voters to the polls. Over the past month, their three head-to-head debates have drawn the largest audiences in cable television history. The second half of last week's MSNBC debate was the most watched show on any channel, with [nearly 8 million viewers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/27/AR2008022703374_pf.html). An astonishing 4 million people tuned in to watch MSNBC's post-debate analysis, an experience so excruciating that it's as if every person in the Bay Area picked the same night to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge. The permanent campaign turns out to be the best reality show ever invented. Any contest that can sustain that kind of excitement is like the World Series of poker: The value of the pot goes up with each hand, and whoever wins it won't be the least bit sorry that both sides went all-in. No matter how it turns out, all of us who love politics have to pinch ourselves that we're alive to see a race that future generations will only read about. Most campaigns, even winning ones, only seem historic in retrospect. This time, we already know it's one for the ages; we just don't know how, when, or whether it's going to end. Even journalists who dread spending the next seven weeks on the Pennsylvania Turnpike have to shake their heads in wonderment. In the lede of their lead story in Wednesday's Washington Post, Dan Balz and Jon Cohen referred to \" [the remarkable contest](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/04/AR2008030401987.html)\" that could stretch on till summer.

The best presidential candidates have the ability to change people's minds. Mitt Romney never got that far because he never failed to change his own mind first. So when Romney gamely suspended his campaign this afternoon, there was heartfelt sadness on both sides of the aisle. Democrats are sorry to lose an adversary whose ideological marathon vividly illustrated the vast distance a man must travel to reach the right wing of the Republican Party.

This year, Okay, folks, here's the deal: We need to fill precisely 4.22 column-inches of type with information about the faceless, tasteless Pirates, and as usual we're not sure we can do it. But guess what? We're already at .95 inches, and we're just getting started! Wait\u2014make that 1.19 inches. ... Should they finish below .500 again (and let's be honest, how can they not?), they will tie the Phillies of 1933-48 for the most consecutive losing seasons. (By the way, that's 3.53 inches, and we haven't even had to mention new manager John Russell, Capps's promise as a closer or the vast potential of the Snell-Gorzelanny duo.) There: 4.22 inches. Piece of cake.\" So now the Pirates even hold the record for consecutive seasons as victims of the same bad joke. Pittsburgh faces all the challenges of a small-market team. Moreover, as David Maraniss pointed out in his lyrical biography, Seven years ago, in a desperate bid to revive the Pirates' fortunes, the city built PNC Park, a gorgeous field with The result?

He finds Craig less hypocritical (\"trolling for sex in a men's room, doesn't logically require that you support gay marriage\"), much easier to pity, and \"pathetic and vulnerable\" in a way Spitzer is not.

( Wednesday, Mar. 5, 2008 [All the Way:]() As death-defying Clinton comebacks go, the primaries in Ohio and Texas were very nearly not heart-stopping enough. On Monday, public polls started predicting a Clinton rebound, threatening to spoil the key to any wild ride: surprise. Luckily, the early exit polls on Tuesday evening showed Obama with narrow leads in both do-or-die states, giving those of us in Clinton World who live for such moments a few more hours to stare into the abyss. Now that the race is once again up for grabs, much of the political establishment is dreading the seven-week slog to the next big primary in Pennsylvania. Many journalists had wanted to go home and put off seeing Scranton until [The Office](http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=6adda763-49df-4bfa-8296-f156094bf0ce) returns on April 10. Some Democrats in Washington were in a rush to find out the winner so they could decide who they've been for all along. As a Clintonite, I'm delighted that the show will go on. But even if I were on the sidelines, my reaction would have been the same. No matter which team you're rooting for, you've got to admit: We will never see another contest like this one, and the political junkie in all of us hopes it will never end. It looks like we could get our wish\u2014so we might as well rejoice and be glad in it. A long, exciting race for the nomination will be good for the Democratic Party, good for the eventual nominee, and the ride of a lifetime for every true political fan. For the party, the benefits are obvious: By making this contest go the distance, the voters have done what party leaders wanted to do all along. This cycle, the Democratic National Committee was desperate to avoid the front-loaded calendar that backfired last time. As [David Greenberg](http://www.slate.com/id/2185831/) points out, the 2004 race was over by the first week of March\u2014and promptly handed Republicans a full eight months to destroy our nominee. This time, the DNC begged states to back-load the calendar, even offering bonus delegates for moving primaries to late spring. Two dozen states flocked to Super Tuesday anyway. Happily, voters took matters into their own hands and gave the spring states more clout than party leaders ever could have hoped for. Last fall, NPR ran a whimsical story about [the plight of South Dakota voters](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15512594), whose June 3 contest is the last primary (along with Montana) on the calendar. Now restaurateurs, innkeepers, and vendors from Pierre to Rapid City look forward to that primary as Christmas in June. But the national party, state parties, and Sioux Falls cafes aren't the only ones who'll benefit. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, the biggest beneficiaries of a protracted battle for the nomination are the two contestants themselves. Primaries are designed to be a warm-up for the general election, and a few more months of spring training will only improve their swings for the fall. And let's face it: These two candidates know how to put on a show. Both are raising astonishing sums of money and attracting swarms of voters to the polls. Over the past month, their three head-to-head debates have drawn the largest audiences in cable television history. The second half of last week's MSNBC debate was the most watched show on any channel, with [nearly 8 million viewers](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/27/AR2008022703374_pf.html). An astonishing 4 million people tuned in to watch MSNBC's post-debate analysis, an experience so excruciating that it's as if every person in the Bay Area picked the same night to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge. The permanent campaign turns out to be the best reality show ever invented. Any contest that can sustain that kind of excitement is like the World Series of poker: The value of the pot goes up with each hand, and whoever wins it won't be the least bit sorry that both sides went all-in. No matter how it turns out, all of us who love politics have to pinch ourselves that we're alive to see a race that future generations will only read about. Most campaigns, even winning ones, only seem historic in retrospect. This time, we already know it's one for the ages; we just don't know how, when, or whether it's going to end. Even journalists who dread spending the next seven weeks on the Pennsylvania Turnpike have to shake their heads in wonderment. In the lede of their lead story in Wednesday's Washington Post, Dan Balz and Jon Cohen referred to \" [the remarkable contest](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/04/AR2008030401987.html)\" that could stretch on till summer.

The best presidential candidates have the ability to change people's minds. Mitt Romney never got that far because he never failed to change his own mind first. So when Romney gamely suspended his campaign this afternoon, there was heartfelt sadness on both sides of the aisle. Democrats are sorry to lose an adversary whose ideological marathon vividly illustrated the vast distance a man must travel to reach the right wing of the Republican Party.

( Friends of mine, a husband and wife, once argued over the price of a packet of cakes bought at a convenience store. She complained that the cakes weren't worth the price she had paid. He pointed out that she had bought them\u2014albeit grudgingly\u2014knowing exactly how they tasted and that, therefore, they had to be worth what she had paid. No prizes for guessing which one of them is an economist. We economists know a lot about pricing, but we tend to be baffled by the way the human race thinks about it. The package holiday offer \"Kids go free to Disneyland\" is, to an economist, a profitable attempt to charge more to couples with two incomes and no children, who are likely to have more cash to burn. To everyone else, it is an idea waved through unquestioningly\u2014we all like kids, after all. The presentation of a pricing policy clearly matters\u2014something disconcerting to economists, who can translate all the pricing into mathematical equations and make the presentation go away. It seems to be acceptable to charge a higher markup for fair-trade coffee, organic bread, or lower-emissions gasoline. It is not acceptable for businesses to say, \"We are such fans of exploitative coffee, pesticide-laced loaves, and dirtier gas that we're willing to discount them and accept a lower profit margin.\" Underneath the gloss, the pricing policies are, nevertheless, identical. The most common puzzle of all, for an economist, is why prices so rarely rise in the face of a shortage. There was a shortage of Wii games consoles last Christmas, [Xbox 360s in 2005](http://www.slate.com/id/2132071/), Playstation 2 consoles before that, and so on. To secure tickets for a hot concert, you will usually need to go to a scalper, because the regular concert promoters wouldn't dare charge a ticket price that might bring demand down to the level of supply. And when U.S. oil companies raised gasoline prices after Hurricane Katrina, there were howls of outrage\u2014despite the fact that the refining infrastructure was badly damaged and that it was evidently impossible to supply everyone at the customary low price. I have previously pondered the very clever explanations economists produce to explain why prices do not rise to equalize supply and demand. Perhaps ticket prices are kept low to encourage a memorabilia-buying younger crowd. Perhaps popular restaurants like to have a waiting list for reservations because it adds to the cachet. Even I am starting to feel that these explanations sound strained. Are these side benefits really enough to outweigh the lost revenue from higher prices? The intuitive explanation, of course, is that we irrationally object to high prices, even when the alternative is rationing, long lines, and uncertainty over whether we can buy what we really want. That is discomfiting for economists, but we might at least take solace in the idea that even though there is no immediate logic to a belief in the just price, there is at least an evolutionary logic. David Friedman\u2014son of the late Milton Friedman and a superb communicator of economics\u2014has argued that our ancestors would have evolved in an environment where most transactions were one-on-one bargains. A hard-wired refusal to accept something other than the customary price would, in such a setting, be an advantage. Anyone who reacts to a price rise with irrational rage turns out to be a strong negotiator. Our stubborn preference for a just price evolved in a setting that is no longer common; but evolution does not respond quickly, which may be why we still shriek with outrage at price hikes. It would also explain why ticket scalpers still prosper. Bloggers analyze Hillary's latest anti-Obama tactic. They also wonder about a history teacher who lambastes Southern Christians and scratch their heads over Ted Turner's cannibalism comments. A winning argument? \"He cannot win, Bill. He cannot win.\" So Hillary Clinton [told](http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/04/candidate-clint.html) Gov.

Richardson evidently thought [likewise](http://thepage.time.com/2008/04/03/source-richardson-said-obama-cant-win/) not too long ago.

Brant at Huffington Post [writes](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-g-brant/so-hillary-obama-cant-win_b_94826.html): \"Since Obama's defeat is an unshakable reality in Hillary's mind, if Barack gets the nomination I hope Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, and Howard Dean arrange for Hillary to spend the period between the convention and the general election in some far away place (Russia? China?) where her negativity will not drag down the efforts of the rest of us to prevent the Republicans from maintaining control over the White House.\" Keith Sullivan, the Independent Liberal, [says](http://kevinsullivan.poligazette.com/?p=465) the Clintons are more \"like a cartel or the mafia, choice is never something that should come into play.

Bloggers jump on a newly released memo by former Bush official John Yoo and discuss the congressional hearings in which oil executives were drilled about their record profits. Did you get the memo? A [2003 memo](http://www.slate.com/id/2187979/entry/2187980/) by then-Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo was declassified Tuesday. The memo argued that federal laws should not apply to military interrogators investigating enemy combatants and was rescinded nine months later. That's not stopping liberal bloggers from having a field day. At Tapped, the blog of the liberal American Prospect, Scott Lemieux references Slate's [own Emily Bazelon](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/convictions/archive/2008/04/01/yoo-s-utter-glib-certainty.aspx) when [registering](http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=04&year=2008&base_name=its_just_that_evil_life_got_yo) shock memo: \"Bazelon [cites](http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/convictions/archive/2008/04/01/yoo-s-utter-glib-certainty.aspx) their 'glib certainty' as what stunned her, but I'd argue this would be potentially acceptable if its arguments were more plausible and the implausibilities weren't in service to such reprehensible ends. It's one thing to, say, confidently assert a very narrow but plausible reading of a statute restricting executive power. Confidently asserting a broad range of arbitrary executive powers (including the power to torture), allegedly beyond the power of the legislature to regulate, despite the explicit textual grants of relevant powers to Congress, during a 'war' whose battlefield could be the entire planet and whose duration could be infinite, is another matter entirely.

When you think about it, it's somewhat breathtaking that, as a group, they were--and remain--so docile, willing to embrace (or, at least, quietly tolerate) a constitutional theory that renders them toothless.\" At TooHotforTNR, Spencer Ackerman [believes](http://toohotfortnr.blogspot.com/2008/04/i-say-we-line-em-all-up-and-we-gun-em.html) this document illustrates the dangers of trying to define \"acceptable\" torture: \"Remember: there is no such thing as a little torture. The slope inevitably slips. Throw this memo in the face of any rightist who hectors that liberals don't 'understand'evil.\" Wired blog Threat Level [argues](http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/04/in-spy-debate-t.html) the damning evidence found in this memo only reinforces the need to declassify more administration documents: \"There's no reason that Congress should be in any hurry to hand more wiretapping power to this administration of exaggerators and chicken littles until it releases the other John Yoo memo -- the one that gave legal cover to the government's spying on American citizens without court orders. The one that told this President that he had the power to order his minions to collect, store and sift through my phone records and internet usage without getting a judge's approval.\" Liberal Steve Benen at the Carpetbagger Report [finds](http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/15083.html) irony in the similarities between the memo and a certain disgraced president: \"Nixon once argued, 'When the President does it, that means that it's not illegal.' It's since become something of a punchline, but the Yoo memo made the tenet official government policy \u2014 so long as administration officials were trying to defend the country, they need not concern themselves with the law.\" But James Poulos of Postmodern Conservative [believes](http://pomoco.typepad.com/postmodern_conservative/2008/04/legal-trouble-t.html) the outcry over limited methods of torture fails to recognize the alternative of suffering on a much larger scale through all-out war: \"And so we have to rely on a different set of extraordinary techniques to try to make up for the fact that we're not prosecuting the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as if the only goals there were military victory. In a way we've got to think soberly about, our dark turn down the torture road is a consequence of our late-modern, small-l liberal nausea over real war.\" [Read](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=Yoo+memo) more about the Yoo memo. Black gold: Executives from the [five largest oil companies testified](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040100157.html?hpid=sec-business) before Congress Tuesday about rising gas prices. While some bloggers are crying foul about subsidies and tax breaks for the oil companies, others suggest the real pain at the pump isn't Big Oil but Big Government. Marc at Cranial Cavity [points](http://cranialcavity.wordpress.com/2008/04/02/congress-and-big-oil/) the finger of blame at government taxes: \"The real price gouger is the government. According to the Tax Foundation, in the last three decades government has collected more than $1.34 trillion (inflation adjusted) in gasoline-tax revenues \u2014 'more than twice the amount of domestic profits earned by major U.S. oil companies during the same period.' \" Townhall's Mary Katherine Ham [suggests](http://www.townhall.com/blog/g/b1869417-96c7-4bfd-88cd-79fa8dc3b181) that the goals of Rep. Ed Markey, chairman of the House committee that held the meeting, are contradictory, since he wants to lower gas prices and \"move beyond this oil economy\": \"One of the things that might actually encourage a move 'beyond the oil economy' are high oil prices, which discourage unnecessary consumption by motorists through perfectly logical self-interest instead of government-imposed conservation mandates or whatever heavy-handed measure it is Markey wishes for,\" she writes. \"Making gas prices artificially respond to your whims makes the process of buying gas artificially painless, thereby removing all indicators for the consumer that he should have any concern at all about an oil economy.\" Polimom at the Moderate Voice [agrees](http://themoderatevoice.com/science/energy/gas-prices/18733/birds-bees-and-big-oil/): \"The best thing that could happen, strangely enough, is for prices to go higher yet. Until we cross above the point where the cost of renewable energy is less than non-renewable, we're stuck ... and no amount of election year grandstanding will get us out of the spring mud.\" ThisJustIn [doesn't foresee](http://aaronmarvin.wordpress.com/2008/04/01/daily-wtf-oil-industry-defends-billions-in-tax-breaks-despite-record-profits/) a downturn in oil prices and therefore believes the oil executives' argument that the industry is cyclical to be defunct: \"So suck it up, oil industry. We have been carrying you for a decade; it's time for you to carry us. And Congress, do what's right: Strip those tax breaks and either invest the entire amount in research for alternative energy sources or give the ailing taxpayers a real tax break (not the upcoming fake one).\" [Read](http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=oil+executives+congress) more about the oil execs' testimony. Bloggers ponder the wonderful notion of a Mugabe-free Zimbabwe and try to figure out what Nancy Pelosi really thinks about superdelegates and a prolonged primary season. Mugabe's end? After 28 years of brutal authoritarian rule, Robert Mugabe [may be on his way out](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/world/africa/02zimbabwe.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin). According to the New York Times, the Zimbabwe president's attempt to falsify last weekend's election results are failing, and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai is in negotiation with Mugabe's top advisers about brokering a transfer of power. This is Zimbabwe's Sokwanele [quotes](http://www.sokwanele.com/thisiszimbabwe/archives/811) one democratic activist: \"i am so happy to see change is finally coming to my country. i have worked for 10 years. i think after change we will have a rainbow zimbabwe made up of tolerance and i pray for a prosperous zimbabwe. my president believes that in 100 days we can feed our children again. sehambile!!!! (he is gone)\" Nancy Reyes at Mugabe makaipa puts one concern [to rest](http://makaipa.blogspot.com/2008/04/stealing-election-in-zimbabwe.html): \"[T]he major worry is that Zimbabwe will turn into another Kenya. The main difference is that in Kenya, the riots were tribal factions backing different men. In Zimbabwe, the Ndebele oppose Mugabe, but many of the opposition leaders, including Morgan Tsvaigirai, are of the majority Mashona tribe. So unlike Kenya, you do not have danger of a tribal war.\" But at the New Republic's Plank, James Kirchick, who knows Mugabe's history well, is [wary](http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/04/01/bizarro-world.aspx) of celebrating the fall of the tyrant just yet: \"[W]hile it's tempting to hold out hope that reports of his imminent demise are true, there is very little about Zimbabwe's history or Mugabe's own behavior to suggest that he would ever retire without handpicking a successor, or that he would ever be forced out office without a fight.\" As Lawhawk at A Blog for All [cautions](http://lawhawk.blogspot.com/2008/04/mugabe-moves-towards-exit.html): \"Mugabe will have to be given quite the golden parachute to make that happen. He still has support from the military and unless the military sees the writing on the wall and chooses to follow the election results that show the opposition clearly winning, they may continue to enable Mugabe's hold on power to the detriment of all Zimbabweans.\" But Kel at the left-wing Osterley Times [notes](http://the-osterley-times.blogspot.com/2008/04/secret-mugabe-meeting-ponders-military.html): \"[T]he speed with which the results are being delivered, alone, tells us that Mugabe has been thrown off course and is frantically trying to fix things in his own favour.

The West has no influence with Mugabe, but it does on his African associates. South Africa's Thabo Mbeki has been one of Mugabes' closest allies, to the shame of Mbeki's own nation.

Nancy's about-face: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi previously said Democratic superdelegates should vote according to the will of the people (read: for Obama), but she's [changed](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080401/ap_on_el_pr/pelosi_democrats) her mind, apparently. She told Good Morning America: \"These superdelegates have the right to vote their conscience and who they think would be the better president, or who can win, but they also then should get involved in the campaigns and make their power known there.\" Now how'd that happen? Conservative Jimmie at the Sundries Shack feels [sorry](http://www.sundriesshack.com/?p=4286) for Pelosi: \"A smart person in her position would have ducked every election question. The Speaker of the House doesn't ahve a lot to do with the election and you could forgive Pelosi for wanting to stay out of the steel cage match that the primary has become.

Bloggers are parsing the significance of Muqtada Sadr's cease-fire in Basra and pondering the rise of abstinence clubs in the Ivy League. Sadr says: Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr [ordered](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/world/middleeast/31iraq.html) his Mahdi Army fighters to stand down Sunday after six days of bloody clashes in Basra. This agreement came as a surprise to some, as Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki had said previously that Iraqi army troops would see the Basra campaign through to victory. Many bloggers [point out](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/mullah-time/?ref=opinion) that Sadr called off his troops after a peace agreement was reached in the Iranian city of Qom. At the Carpetbagger Report, liberal Steve Benen [finds](http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/15060.html) Maliki and Bush the losers here. \"The humiliation for Maliki \u2014 and, by extension, the Bush administration policy \u2014 is rather breathtaking. He launched this offensive, he oversaw the 'crackdown' on Shiite militias, he vowed to see this through to 'victory,' and he was backed up by U.S. forces, despite his apparent reluctance to tell U.S. officials about his plans before he attacked. And now look at the landscape.\" At 1 Boring Old Man, liberal Mickey [opines](http://1boringoldman.com/index.php/2008/03/31/spinning-straw-into-gold/) that, despite the glaring defeat, the Bush administration will find a way to spin it favorably: \"There's been enough bloodshed in Iraq for several wars. Bush and Cheney will be spinning like Rumpelstiltskin, about al-Malaki's flexing his muscles. Meanwhile, Moqtada al-Sadr comes out of it still holding Basra, Sadr City, and probably most of Southern Iraq. He emerges from it as a proven Military and Political force. And he is likely headed to the winner's circle in the elections due in October.\" \"Any illusion that Iraq is near political reconciliation has also been shattered. The Western media division of Iraqis into merely three sects\u2014Shiite, Sunni, and Kurd\u2014is obviously wrong, as there is substantial discord within those groups,\" [observes](http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2008/03/defeated_maliki_accepts_cease-fire/) James Joyner at Outside the Beltway. \"It's difficult to imagine that six days of killing one another is going to lessen that in the near term.\" At the Seminal, Washingtonian Jason Rosenbaum [suggests](http://www.theseminal.com/2008/03/31/truce-in-iraq-maybe/) integrating Sadr into the official power structure: \"The way forward, as it has always been, is to bring Al-Sadr into the government. Declaring offensives on his followers - thugs and criminals though they may be - isn't going to work, and going back on our agreements is only going to breed more distrust. Given our history, I wouldn't hold out too much hope for this truce, but perhaps those ruling Iraq will finally prove me wrong.\" Many bloggers gravitate toward the fact Iran brokered the peace, citing a McClatchy [piece](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/homepage/story/32055.html) by Leila Fadel. Conservative Jules Crittenden takes the trip to Qom as [final proof](http://www.julescrittenden.com/2008/03/31/part-of-the-problem/) the Iranians are deeply involved in Iraq's internal affairs. \"Persians, magnanimous, agree to call off their Shiite militias.

In the article, Fredell dubs herself an \"unconventional feminist,\" as, she says, \"conventional feminists\" believe in \"the freedom to have sex without consequences.\" \"The problem for these privileged kids is that they succeed in investing way too much focus and power on sex by making it a platform to display the perceived sanctity of their moral compass and personal virtue.

Abstaining from sex does NOT mean 'Women Reclaim Self-Respect.' That logic is just off. What, any woman who has sex doesn't hold herself in high regard? Another issue is how having any sex at all suddenly means you are promiscuous. Guess what? It is possible to satisfy your desires without being an egomaniac or self-hating doormat,\" she writes. At What Would Phoebe Do, Phoebe Maltz is [unimpressed](http://whatwouldphoebedo.blogspot.com/2008/03/there-is-no-condom-for-heart.html) with Fredell's commitment because of her youth. \"Too much is made of the 'choice' to be virgins made by people who aren't even that old, and probably haven't met someone they wanted to have sex with yet. We all had that freshman-year dorm-mate who 'didn't drink,' who went on to spend the whole of spring term hungover.

At Christian Reformed Campus Ministries at UWO, University of Western Ontario blogger Mike Wagenman [applauds](http://crcmuwo.ca/2008/03/31/virginity-means-strength/) the existence of True Love Revolution.

Strong people respect themselves, others, and God with their bodies.\" While Savannah-based Christian writer Harrison Scott Key, at Worldmagblog, [supports](http://www.worldontheweb.com/2008/03/31/true-lust-waits/) the abstinence message, he thinks the group's secular nature will hurt it. \"Her group's arguments are powerful with the university audience, but if her propositions are founded on secular ideologies, they will ultimately fail.

The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html) leads with a look at what went wrong in the Iraqi government's offensive on Basra. It all apparently comes down to a question of planning, which was at least partly due to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's failure to understand the full strength of the militias, as he was convinced the assault [would be a success](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/middleeast/03basra.html?ref=todayspaper). Ambassador Ryan Crocker tells the paper that he first learned of the operation on March 21 and insists U.S. officials thought it would involve a long-term strategy to slowly root out militias from the area. [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/) leads an [interview with Crocker](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080403/1a_lede03_dom.art.htm), who says the offensive \"had its share of problems\" and estimates that the United States had only about 48 hours' notice before the operation began. Overall, though, Crocker, who is set to testify before Congress next week, insists the situation in Iraq has improved and says he expects the \"political and economic progress\" to continue. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/), Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/), and the Wall Street Journal's world-wide newsbox lead with Senate leaders agreeing on a bipartisan plan to [help the housing market](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mortgage3apr03,0,1833858.story). The package would cost approximately $15 billion over the next 10 years and involves a little give-and-take on both sides, as it's clear that lawmakers are facing intense pressure to get something passed. The WP is most blunt in [stating up high](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/02/AR2008040202293.html) that the measure provides billions for \"the slumping home-building industry while offering little to homeowners threatened with foreclosure.\" The plan would provide $6 billion in tax breaks for home builders, tax breaks for those who purchase foreclosed properties, grants for cities to buy foreclosed properties, $100 million for counseling, and a new deduction on property taxes, among other measures. When Maliki launched the full-scale assault in Basra, \"nothing was in place from our side,\" Crocker said. Apparently U.S. and Iraqi officials were developing a plan that would involve a slow buildup of troops followed by [strategic attacks against militias](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/middleeast/03basra.html?ref=todayspaper). Gen. David Petraeus even warned Maliki that acting too quickly could reverse recent gains. But Maliki seemed determined to have a triumphant moment and, displaying his very impulsive nature, decided to send his troops into the city of Basra even before all the Iraqi reinforcements had arrived. U.S. forces then had to quickly get organized in order to come to the aid of the Iraqi troops. On the upside, the move did show that Iraqi troops have the ability to mobilize quickly. In a Page One article, the LAT tries to figure out how the Iraqi [security forces performed during the fighting](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-battle3apr03,1,7627791.story), which is something lawmakers will undoubtedly ask Petraeus next week. There is no clear answer, although most seem to agree that the Iraqi forces did relatively well overall, even as the fighting revealed they continue to be plagued with logistical and command problems. \"There were pockets of excellence, but there was no synchronized excellence,\" a U.S. Army official said. The biggest shortcomings seemed to come from the national police, who often are not trained in urban warfare. Although there are no official figures, there are reports that a large number of police officers deserted or worked with militias during the fighting. \"Police work where they live and are inherently influenced by the politics of their community,\" said a Western security official, who estimates there was a more than 50 percent desertion rate in Mahdi Army strongholds. Senators came under much criticism yesterday for removing the provision from the housing legislation that would have allowed bankruptcy judges to [modify the terms of mortgages](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mortgage3apr03,0,1833858.story). Some estimate this change could prevent as many as 600,000 foreclosures, notes the LAT. Passing it without this provision \"amounts to dancing around a fire when Congress is supposed to be putting it out,\" the president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said. The WP points out that Democrats \" [will almost certainly](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/02/AR2008040202293.html)\" try to reinsert the bankruptcy provision as an amendment. Under a [huge picture](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/04/03/world/03nato_650.jpg) of President Bush walking with the president of Romania near a beautiful lake (swan included!), the NYT [points out that](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/washington/03bush.html?ref=todayspaper) \"for a man who came into office as the nation's first M.B.A. president,\" he has \"sometimes seemed invisible during the housing and credit crunch.\" Yesterday was another clear example of this because Bush was discussing NATO membership while the Senate rushed out its bipartisan plan. Allowing others in the administration to discuss the issue could be a good idea considering his low approval ratings. But some Republicans worry that if Bush continues this way, most will simply remember how he was surprised to hear about $4-a-gallon gasoline, and he will end his tenure appearing out of touch with the concerns of regular citizens. The WP and WSJ front news that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke finally said the R-word before Congress yesterday. \"A recession is possible,\" [Bernanke said](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/02/AR2008040200343.html). Although Fed leaders usually avoid using the word, many analysts praised Bernanke for being more honest, even if he was saying something that everyone already knew. \"This testimony says that the Fed isn't in denial anymore,\" an economist said. The NYT and LAT front the latest from Zimbabwe, where election officials announced that President Robert Mugabe's party had [lost control of parliament](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/africa/03zimbabwe.html?ref=todayspaper). And now it seems virtually certain that there will be a runoff between Mugabe and Morgan Tsvangirai. The LAT notes that [an initial pronouncement](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-zimbabwe3apr03,1,2766668.story) from opposition leaders who said Tsvangirai had received more than 50 percent of the vote, which the NYT cites, was actually due to an \"embarrassing math mistake.\" In fact, the opposition's own figures show Tsvangirai didn't quite reach the 50 percent threshold. Both papers note that there's growing fear that a runoff will lead to widespread violence that was all too common in previous campaigns. In the WSJ's op-ed page, [Richard Bond](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120718646939385289.html?mod=todays_us_opinion), a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, says Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has the power to end the Obama-Clinton fight if he's willing to put his own interests aside for the good of the country and his party. Reid would have to agree to step down and offer the role of Senate leader to Clinton. Bond thinks that \"only the proffer of this consolation prize would likely persuade Mrs. Clinton\" to drop out. Meanwhile, USAT says many Democratic insiders see [North Carolina's primary](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080403/1a_cover03x.art.htm) on May 6 as Clinton's last chance to improve her standing or face even more calls for her withdrawal from the contest. The NYT breaks word that rapper Jay-Z is close to reaching a $150 million deal with [concert promoter Live Nation](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/arts/music/03jayz.html?ref=todayspaper). The paper says the deal \"rivals the biggest music contracts ever awarded\" and notes that it could be a sign of what is to come as the music industry deals with the constant decline of album sales. The contract would give Live Nation a stake in virtually every aspect of Jay-Z's career for the next 10 years, and the WSJ suggests that these side deals with the ever-enterprising artist are the real draw for Live Nation rather than his concerts. \"I've turned into the Rolling Stones of hip-hop,\" Jay-Z said. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/) leads with the release of a [notorious 2003 Justice Department memo](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040102213.html) that argued that military interrogators didn't have to follow the law because they were defending the country. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html) leads with Senate leaders vowing to bring bipartisan legislation to help [homeowners at risk](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/washington/02housing.html?ref=todayspaper) of foreclosure, a story that also [tops](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120707574854880909.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/page/us_in_todays_paper.html?mod=topnav_0_0002)'s world-wide newsbox. The [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front) leads with the federal government saying it will [waive](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-fence2apr02,1,6993174.story) a variety of environmental regulations to ease construction of a fence between the United States and Mexico. [USA Today](http://usatoday.com/) leads with Federal Aviation Administration whistleblowers saying that top FAA officials are [too cozy with airlines](http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2008-04-01-airlines_N.htm) and block enforcement of safety rules. The interrogation memo, written by John Yoo, then the second-ranking official at the Office of Legal Counsel, put forward a \"national and international version of the right to self-defense.\" The existence of the memo has been known for a long time, but it was released only yesterday. According to the memo: \"If a government defendant were to harm an enemy combatant during an interrogation in a manner that might arguably violate a criminal prohibition, he would be doing so in order to prevent further attacks on the United States by the al Qaeda terrorist network. ... In that case, we believe that he could argue that the executive branch's constitutional authority to protect the nation from attack justified his actions.\" Legal scholars competed with each other to come up with the strongest possible denunciation of the memo. \"This is a monument to executive supremacy and the imperial presidency,\" one told the NYT, which also fronted the story. But the Post got an e-mail from Yoo himself, now a law professor, who said: \"Far from inventing some novel interpretation of the Constitution ... our legal advice to the President, in fact, was near boilerplate.\" The Post also helpfully posts PDFs of the memo, in [two](http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/pdfs/OLCMemo1-19.pdf) [parts](http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/pdfs/OLCMemo20-39.pdf), so you can be appalled yourself. Senators have just gotten back from a two-week recess, and apparently they heard from constituents who aren't happy the government bailed out investment bank Bear Sterns without doing anything to help ordinary homeowners hit by the country's economic crisis. \"Everyone was home for a couple of weeks, and if they heard what I heard in Florida, I think that they realize this is a serious, serious problem,\" said Florida's Republican Sen. Mel Martinez, as quoted in the LAT, which off-leads the story. Lawmakers still haven't finalized the details of the bipartisan housing bill, but the papers say its provisions are likely to include money to issue bonds to refinance subprime loans, funding for counseling programs for at-risk homeowners, and requirements for lenders to give more information to homebuyers. It would leave out a controversial provision of a Democratic-backed bill, the ability of bankruptcy judges to modify home loan terms. The bill could be ready as early as this afternoon, the NYT says. The Department of Homeland Security and its head, Michael Chertoff, apparently got tired of dealing with all the regulations that the border fence was up against. It had already prepared draft environmental impact assessments as required by law, and \"environmental groups said they were awaiting the final reports when Chertoff made the announcement.\" \"It's surprising how cursory their reviews have been,\" said Kim Delfino, director of the California branch of Defenders of Wildlife. \"There's a lot of boilerplate and analysis shifted from one document to another. It's kind of like they were going through the motions.\" With the new waivers, DHS hopes to finish the 670-mile project by the end of the year. Zimbabwe's longtime dictator Robert Mugabe appeared to be losing control of his country, as initial results from Saturday's presidential election show an opposition candidate winning, and there are apparently talks underway for a peaceful handover of power. Both the [NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/world/africa/02zimbabwe.html?ref=todayspaper) and the [Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040100956.html?sid=ST2008040101033) put the story on the front page. Both the WSJ and Post find bad news for John McCain as he runs for president in a struggling economy. One of his top advisers, Phil Gramm, led the deregulation of the banking and financial services industry as a senator in the 1990s and is now a vice chairman of a bank wrapped up in the subprime mortgage crisis. Another adviser is Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, who was publicly ousted by the company's board. [The Post asks](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040102860.html) if these people are good for McCain to be tied to publicly. \"I, for one, have thought about it a lot,\" one McCain adviser answered. \"And that's all I will say.\" The Journal, meanwhile, finds that business groups that are traditionally Republican-friendly are [donating more](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120709422285181841.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama than to McCain. One reason is that McCain has annoyed many business leaders with his vaunted \"maverick\" approach; another is that people don't expect him to win. Corporations have been \"moving in a direction where the electorate is likely to be,\" a Democratic analyst said. Also in the papers ... Intelligence centers operated by states have more personal data on you than you probably were aware of, the [Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040103049.html) finds. Also in the [Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040102207.html), South Dakota is going to try another abortion ban referendum. The United Kingdom is showing a stiff upper lip and putting its troop drawdown in Basra on hold in light of [increased violence](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/world/europe/02basra.html?ref=todayspaper) there, the NYT says. A House committee dabbled in the online world of Second Life, with predictably cringe-worthy results, the Post [reports](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/01/AR2008040102372.html). The LAT says the [Olympic torch](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-torch2apr02,1,5865293.story) is set to make its only appearance in the United States next week, in San Francisco, and the Chinese are probably thinking twice about choosing a city with such a high per-capita number of angry activists. Mormons and Muslims are finding that they have a lot in common, the LAT [reports](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/california/la-me-morlims2apr02,0,4729361.story). \"A Mormon living in an Islamic society would be very comfortable,\" one Mormon tells the paper. The [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/) leads with a follow-up to the World Food Program's recent emergency appeal for more money and takes a look at how the worldwide phenomenon of rising food prices is leading to [more hunger](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-food1apr01,1,5014433.story) and food shortages. The WFP director calls it \"a perfect storm\" because not only does it cost much more for the agency to continue its current programs, but the number of people who need help is continuously increasing. The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html) leads with a lawsuit that claims insurance companies are costing the [Social Security system](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/business/01disabled.html?ref=todayspaper) millions of dollars every year by forcing people who file disability claims with them to also apply for money from the federal program even if it's clear that they'll be denied. These insurers often force claimants to appeal the denial, thus costing more money and delaying benefits for people who really need the government program. The Wall Street Journal leads its world-wide newsbox with a look at how the offensive in Basra weakened Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and increased the power of cleric Muqtada Sadr. Iraq was quieter yesterday after most of Sadr's supporters appear to have complied with the cleric's call for a cease-fire. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/?nav=globetop) and [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080401/index.htm) lead with the resignation of Housing Secretary Alphonso Jackson. USAT points out that it's the [first time](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080401/1a_lede01.art.htm) in Bush's tenure that a member of his Cabinet has resigned amid a criminal investigation. The WP characterizes it as a [clear blow to the administration](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/31/AR2008033102672.html), particularly since he's leaving in the middle of the mortgage crisis. Democrats had called for his ouster because Jackson is the subject of multiple investigations for charges that he improperly used his position to hand contracts to friends. Jackson, one of the few remaining officials in the Bush administration who followed the president from Texas in 2001, announced he would be leaving on April 18. Besides feeding people in places like Sudan, where many rely exclusively on aid, WFP officials are particularly concerned about what they say is [a new category](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-food1apr01,1,5014433.story) of needy people who could once afford to eat but for whom rising prices have turned the most basic of necessities into somewhat of a luxury. These are mostly people who live in urban areas and are at the mercy of market prices. Several countries have already experienced food riots, and officials expect more to come. Meanwhile, the LAT does a good job of explaining how growing hunger can quickly reverse years of progress in developing countries by worsening overall health and decreasing education levels. Insurers who pay out [long-term disability insurance](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/business/01disabled.html?ref=todayspaper) want claimants to try to get Social Security benefits because it would cut down on the amount of money the private company would have to pay out every month. The problem is that the government program defines disability much more stringently than private companies and usually doesn't pay out money unless the person can't do any job at all. But everyone still has the right to apply for Social Security benefits and each case must be investigated, which is why even the ones that are obvious denials cost time and money for an already-strapped system. These costs are then multiplied when insurers force claimants to appeal a denial again and again. The WSJ talks to U.S. officials who say Maliki also lost a significant amount of support because there's a widespread perception among Iraqi people that he ordered the strikes in Basra to improve his political standing before the October elections. But now Maliki [looks weaker](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120695720918576769.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) than ever, and Sadr has seldom looked stronger. An expert in Shiite politics tells the WSJ this will end up being a \"defining moment for Iraq\" because it will mark \"the birth of Sadrist power.\" Meanwhile, McClatchy is reporting that the Iranian general who helped Iraqi generals negotiate the cease-fire deal with Sadr is on the [U.S. terrorist watch list](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/32141.html). \"Iran showed that they could mediate this cease-fire while the U.S. has shown very little influence,\" a Middle East expert said. All the papers front or reefer a look at how the plan by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. to overhaul the financial regulatory system, which was officially unveiled yesterday, was immediately criticized by a variety of lawmakers and interest groups. The plan calls for streamlining the agencies that oversee the financial system, but no one really thinks it has much of a chance of passing, because it's simply too complicated and involves too many moving pieces. The Post points out that the plan calls for the revamping or elimination of some longtime Washington institutions, [which is never easy to do](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/31/AR2008033100223.html). The LAT quotes an expert who says [Paulson is merely](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-paulson1apr01,1,2435541.story) \"taking advantage of the current crisis to push a regulatory restructuring plan that would otherwise attract no interest.\" Paulson warned that \"those who want to quickly label the blueprint as advocating more or less regulation are oversimplifying.\" And indeed, the NYT notes that [the plan](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/business/01regulate.html?ref=todayspaper) \"features both regulatory and deregulatory elements.\" Regardless, Democratic lawmakers said they simply don't have time for such huge overhauls when they have to deal with the current crisis. \"This is a wild pitch. It is not even close to the strike zone,\" Sen. Christopher Dodd [said](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120697114969676991.html?mod=todays_us_page_one). The Consumer Federation of America was [more blunt](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/business/01regulate.html?ref=todayspaper): \"Rolling out this plan in the middle of the current crisis is like telling Hurricane Katrina victims stranded on their rooftops in New Orleans, 'Don't worry, if you can hold for a few years, we've got a really great plan to restructure the federal emergency response system.' \" If you fall victim to a prank today, don't worry, it probably means people like you. The NYT points out anthropologists have found that practical jokes, like the ones many will be victims of during April Fools' Day, are a common way to [welcome someone into a group](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/01/health/01mind.html?ref=todayspaper). \"It can be a kind of flattery, if you're being brought in,\" a sociologist tells the paper. Plus, it could be good for you. \"The feeling of 'I should have known better' is the sort of counterfactual that serves to highlight your own shortcomings,\" a psychologist explains. \"These counterfactual insights can kick-start new behaviors, new Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html), Street Journal's world-wide newsbox all lead with Shiite cleric Muqtada Sadr calling on his followers to put down their weapons and bring to an end [six days of clashes](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/world/middleeast/31iraq.html?ref=todayspaper) with Iraqi and U.S. forces. In exchange, Sadr [demanded](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/30/AR2008033000261.html) that the Iraqi government stop \"illegal and haphazard raids,\" and free his followers who are now imprisoned but haven't been convicted of any crimes. Sadr also demanded the government help bring back \"the displaced people who have fled their homes as a result of military operations.\" The LAT says the six days of fighting have killed [more than 350 people](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-iraq31mar31,1,116458.story). [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080331/index.htm) leads with word that the Transportation Security Administration will begin testing a more serene screening process at one airport in the hopes that it will [improve security](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080331/1a_lede31.art.htm). Here's a preview: \"Mauve lights glow softly, soothing music hums, and smiling employees offer quiet greetings and assistance.\" TSA officials think it will be easier to catch suspicious passengers if security checkpoints are no longer synonymous with stress. In a chaotic atmosphere, screeners could subconsciously feel the need to rush. \"Chaos gives camouflage,\" the TSA administrator explained. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki called Sadr's statement \"a step in the right direction,\" though it's unclear whether the government is willing to [meet his demands](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/world/middleeast/31iraq.html?ref=todayspaper). Also, no one knows whether many of his followers will listen and actually drop their weapons since his movement is hardly unified and many have divided into [separate militias](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/30/AR2008033000261.html). Regardless, everyone reports that even though violence continued after Sadr's announcement, it seemed as though it had decreased in several key areas. \"Some laid down their arms while others kept fighting,\" [the Post summarizes](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/30/AR2008033000261.html). The NYT, WP, and USAT point out that Maliki allies traveled to Iran in order to negotiate with Sadr. USAT focuses its Page One story on the [Iran angle](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080331/1a_offlede31_dom.art.htm?loc=interstitialskip) and says the agreement was brokered by the commander of the Quds brigades of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. \"The government proved once again that Iran is a central player in Iraq,\" a political analyst tells USAT. How much the violence will decrease in the coming days still needs to be seen, but the NYT and LAT both note that if there's one single loser from the six days of clashes [it's Maliki](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/world/middleeast/31iraq.html?ref=todayspaper), who clearly underestimated the strength of the militias. The prime minister made a big deal of emphasizing that he was overseeing the operation in Basra and vowed to stay in the area until the militias were defeated. \"If anyone comes out a winner, it's Sadr,\" a Middle East expert [tells the LAT](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-iraq31mar31,1,116458.story). \"He's coming out stronger, and Maliki looks like a lame duck.\" The WP points out that Sadr appears \" [more politically astute](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/30/AR2008033000261.html)\" than he was a few years ago because he seems to realize that his chances of winning big in the upcoming provincial elections would markedly improve if he can claim credit for helping end the current bout of violence. Early-morning wire stories report that the [Green Zone](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080331/wl_nm/iraq_attack_dc;_ylt=ApeWjgi2MN.WvjOOTWj7o8as0NUE) was once again pounded by rocket and mortar attacks today. The WSJ goes inside with word that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Alphonso Jackson will [resign this morning](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120692786807175983.html?mod=todays_us_page_one). The move is a blow to the Bush administration since Jackson has been a key player in its efforts to deal with the housing crisis. But Jackson has faced intense criticism throughout his tenure, and many critics have pointed to his failures at handling public housing after Hurricane Katrina. Most recently, Jackson has been under investigation for charges that he gave out lucrative contracts to friends. The WSJ fronts a look at how a number of figures in the Democratic Party are throwing their support to Sen. Barack Obama in an effort to get Sen. Hillary Clinton to [drop out of the race](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120692054573175525.html?mod=todays_us_page_one). The paper gets word that Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will endorse Obama today. In addition, the seven Democratic House members from North Carolina are all expected to endorse Obama as a group before the state's May 6 primary. Although calls for Clinton to get out of the race continue to get louder, the WSJ points out that \"no Democrat today has the power to knock heads and resolve the mess.\" Everyone notes that Zimbabwe's main opposition party claimed victory after presidential and parliamentary elections, which would mark an end to President Robert Mugabe's [28 years in power](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-zimbabwe31mar31,1,1283476.story). But these claims were based on unofficial vote counts at each polling station while the nation's election commission released almost no results. The delay led to growing tension across the country as many speculated that it was giving the government an opportunity to rig the results. The LAT fronts, and everybody else reefers, the death of Dith Pran, the Cambodian-born journalist whose amazing story of survival in the brutal Khmer Rouge regime served [as the basis for the 1984 movie The Killing Fields](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-me-dith31mar31,1,1820395.story). He was 65 and died of pancreatic cancer. Dith helped Sydney Schanberg, the NYT journalist who covered the rise of the Khmer Rouge, make sense of Cambodia. When Schanberg was forced to get out of Cambodia, he had to leave Dith behind. Nothing was heard from him for years, and he was presumed dead. But more than four years later, Dith managed to escape and moved to New York, where he became [a photographer for the NYT](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/nyregion/31dith.html?ref=todayspaper). USAT reports that a new survey reveals traditional dog names are falling out of favor, and more people are choosing to give their four-legged friends names that are [usually associated with humans](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/life/20080331/d_hnb31.art.htm). Still, it seems some traditions are hard to shake since Buddy continues to be among the top names for male dogs. Other top choices include Max and Rocky for males, while Bella, Molly, and Lucy head the list for females. \"It's a reflection of the position that pets hold in a household,\" an expert in dog history tells the paper. \"They are integral members of the family, just like a child.\" The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html#Week%20in%20Review) leads with with a report on violence in Basra, where Shiite militiamen continued to frustrate the Iraqi government's efforts to wrest back control of the city; U.S. troops also clashed with insurgents in Baghdad, prompting fears that the tension could flare into a wider conflict. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/) eyes the Treasury Department's plans to rewrite America's financial rule-book; lawmakers and regulators said the revamp was unlikely to jolt the U.S. economy out of its current funk. The [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/) leads with a look at the Democratic district conventions now underway in Texas, where tensions are running high as supporters of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama jockey for position. Despite the presence of 30,000 police and government troops, Mahdi army militiamen yesterday [retained control](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/world/middleeast/30iraq.html?ref=todayspaper) of broad swathes of Basra, repeatedly launching attacks on government positions before [vanishing into alleyways](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/weekinreview/30glan.html?ref=todayspaper) and slums. The NYT reports that violence also spread north to Shiite districts of Baghdad, prompting fears of a wider breakdown of the ceasefire called by the Mahdi Army's founder, Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. The Post reports that the U.S. military [provided ground and air support](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/29/AR2008032900528.html) to Iraqi government forces in Basra, and killed dozens of Shiite insurgents during clashes in Baghdad. The LAT [fronts a piece](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-shiites30mar30,0,3606027,full.story) framing the battle for Basra as a power struggle between the Mahdi army and the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, the national government's largest Shiite faction; the NYT likewise notes that the government assault [may be intended](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/world/middleeast/30assess.html?ref=todayspaper&pagewanted=all), at least in part, to tarnish the Mahdi army's reputation ahead of coming provincial elections. On the NYT's op-ed page, Anthony Cordesman [makes a similar point](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/opinion/30cordesman.html?ref=todayspaper&pagewanted=all), warning that the United States should be cautious about too readily endorsing the central government's attack on the Sadr movement. The U.S. presidential hopefuls also [joined the debate](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/us/politics/30campaign.html?ref=todayspaper); John McCain said the Basra assault was a sign of the Iraqi government's strength, while Barack Obama argued that it highlighted the Bush administration's failure to resolve Iraq's lingering political tensions. Back home, the backlash has begun against the Treasury Department's proposed overhaul of America's decades-old financial regulatory apparatus; the Post reports that the revamp will [take years to implement](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/29/AR2008032902060.html) and will have little impact on the current credit crunch. And while the move would allow the Federal Reserve to [send SWAT teams](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/business/29regulate.html) into industry sectors or institutions that threatened the stability of the overall financial system, the NYT notes that the fine print makes it clear that the government would [do virtually nothing](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/business/30regulate.html?ref=todayspaper) to regulate many of the financial products that precipitated the current crisis. In an [editorial](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/opinion/30sun2.html?ref=todayspaper), the NYT says it's hard to have confidence in the reforms, given the Bush administration's \"disastrous\" track record. Hillary Clinton [earns space](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/29/AR2008032901909.html?hpid=topnews) on the Post's front page by declaring her intention to stay in the presidential race until the end of the primary season and perhaps even until the Democratic National Convention in August; she said she wouldn't consider bowing out until the spat over Michigan and Florida's invalid primaries was resolved. The NYT runs [a similar story](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/us/politics/30clinton.html) inside, eying Clinton's efforts to woo Indiana voters ahead of the state's primary on May 6. Clinton's pledge came as Texas Democrats bickered over the state's delegates; the LAT reports that infighting could cause the Democratic Party [lasting damage](http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-dems30mar30,0,4277084.story) at the state and local level. Barack Obama, meanwhile, says he [has no problem](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/us/politics/30obama.html) with Clinton staying in the race; the Post's editorial board agrees, arguing that \"polite political combat\" [will only strengthen](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/29/AR2008032901846.html) the eventual Democratic nominee. Zimbabweans went to the polls yesterday, but many feared that whichever way they voted, President Robert Mugabe would retain his 28-year grip on power. The NYT reports that voter rolls are [absurdly swollen](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/world/africa/30zimbabwe.html?ref=todayspaper) with the names of fabricated or deceased voters; even Ian Smith, the white prime minister who led the country when it was still Rhodesia, is on the lists. Still, with the economy in utter collapse\u2014the official inflation rate of 100,000 percent is widely believed to be an underestimate\u2014the Post says a stolen result could [tip the country into chaos](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/29/AR2008032900374.html). \"If Mugabe wins, there will be civil war,\" said one opposition supporter. Both the NYT and the Post cover Condoleezza Rice's calls for Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to [cooperate on security](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/world/middleeast/30mideast.html?ref=todayspaper) in the West Bank; the move, which came as Rice began a trip to the Middle East, was intended to jump-start [three-pronged negotiations](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/29/AR2008032902240_3.html) between Israel, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. Colombian officials say computer files captured in a controversial cross-border raid show that the Venezuelan government has been [attempting to arm](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/30/world/americas/30colombia.html?ref=todayspaper) Colombia's leftist guerrillas. The NYT says the files, currently being examined by Interpol, suggest that Venezuela's intelligence chief offered to mediate between Colombia's FARC rebels and a Panamanian arms dealer, and that the group asked Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez for a quarter-billion-dollar loan \"to be paid when we take power.\" Ch\u00e1vez mocked the reports, saying the files had been forged. \"This computer is like \u00e0 la carte service, giving you whatever you want,\" Ch\u00e1vez said. \"You want steak? Or fried fish? How would you like it prepared? You'll get it however the empire decides.\" The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html) and the [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/) lead with a Treasury Department plan to grant broad new market-stabilizing powers to the Federal Reserve. The plan is part of a larger attempt to simplify the nation's \"alphabet soup\" of financial regulatory agencies. The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/index.html) fronts that story but leads with another Bush administration proposal\u2014a plan to bail out homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages after the values of their homes have dramatically decreased. The proposal encourages lenders to let homeowners refinance their property for a more affordable rate, forgiving a portion of their debt in exchange for financial backing from the federal government. The [Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/public/page/2_0433.html?mod=hpp_us_pageone_more) tops its world-wide newsbox with U.S. forces' launching of airstrikes in Basra, Iraq, as Iraqi forces faced a strong resistance from Shiite militias. The Treasury Department's proposal comes after a year of study by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, [the LAT reports](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-treasury29mar29,0,5300410.story), and would overhaul a system built piece-by-piece over the past century and a half. The plan, which requires detailed approval by Congress, would consolidate the current jumble of regulatory agencies\u2014including the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2014into three overseeing institutions. The [NYT predicts](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/business/29regulate.html?ref=todayspaper) Democrats' response, saying they'll likely complain that it does not go far enough toward limiting the activities that caused the current financial crisis. An LAT quote from one prominent Democrat, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, confirms that premonition: Schumer says that Democrats agree with \"large parts\" of the proposal in \"broad outlines\" but that it does not address \"the full spectrum of complex new financial securities.\" Both [the WP](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/29/AR2008032900094.html) and the LAT credit the NYT for breaking the story on its Web site late Friday. The WP [leads with](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/28/AR2008032804017.html) a second Bush administration proposal addressing the credit crunch\u2014a plan to rescue homeowners who face foreclosure because falling prices mean they now owe far more than their homes are worth. Details are still being finalized, but the administration has revealed that the plan resembles one proposed two weeks ago by Democratic Rep. Barney Frank (legislation the WSJ [says](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120675020702373407.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) has \"little hope of passing in its current form\"). Under the proposal, the Federal Housing Authority would urge lenders \"to forgive a portion of those loans and issue new, smaller mortgages in exchange for the financial backing of the federal government.\" If successful, the Post explains, the plan would mark the first time the White House has committed federal funds to assist individual borrowers. The NYT, WP, and LAT all front Sen. Patrick Leahy's call for Sen. Hillary Clinton to drop out of Democratic race for president and avert a bloody nomination battle with Sen. Barack Obama. The NYT [serves up](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/us/politics/29dems.html) Sen. Clinton's behind-closed-doors analysis\u2014she told Democratic allies that she is the girl being \"bullied out\" of the race by the rough boys. Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean set out to calm \"increasingly anxious\" Democrats, the WP [reports](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/28/AR2008032803573.html?sid=ST2008032900022), by taking a television tour and setting a \"target date\" of July 1 for finalizing the party's nomination. (Dean was suspiciously short on details as to how the \"target date\" will be met.) The LAT [explains](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-campaign29mar29,1,878738.story) the \"growing anxiety\" in the party as Sen. Clinton reaping what she sowed\u2014a self-focused, \"complex and difficult\" relationship with fellow Democrats that is coming back to haunt her candidacy. Clinton hopes to right her campaign with victories in Pennsylvania, where she enjoys a comfortable lead in the polls. U.S. forces launched airstrikes in Basra in the midst of heavy fighting between U.S. and Iraqi soldiers and Shiite militiamen, according to the WSJ's world-wide newsbox. The NYT [reports](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/world/middleeast/29iraq.html?ref=todayspaper) that the campaign was initially handled by Iraqi security forces, who asked American forces to step in when they were unable to control the situation. Washington Post correspondent Sudarsan Raghavan fleshes out the day of sudden violence with a [sprawling report](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/28/AR2008032803810.html) from Sadr City, where he was trapped 19 hours alongside the Mahdi army of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. Raghavan's riveting account includes real-time interviews with Abu Mustafa al-Thahabi, a military adviser to the Mahdi army. Neither the NYT nor the WP can resist subtle philosophizing about what the pitch battles in Iraq \"underscore.\" Spring brings baseball to LAT's [Column One](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-manatees29mar29,1,4282023.story), which observes the early rehearsals of the Florida Marlins' new plus-sized male cheer team, the Manatees. The Miami-based team's latest attempt at fighting perennial low-attendance, the Manatees weigh in from 225 to 435 pounds, and most of them still can't dance after weeks of practices. Or maybe they're too busy making hot dog jokes and staring at the team's more traditional cheerleaders\u2014the Mermaids\u2014to remember the steps. The LAT's humorous, understandably skeptical account is perhaps best captured by the response of one Manatee's 8-year-old daughter: \"Oh, daddy, no!\" Elsewhere in the lighthearted Saturday copy, a [WP op-ed](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/28/AR2008032802827.html) belatedly debunks Sen. Hillary Clinton's \"3 a.m. Phone Call\" ad by providing a history of presidential slumber. The experts\u2014including Henry Kissinger\u2014say they can't remember any decisions that had to be made in the middle of the night, and even when presidents are woken, they can usually take the report and go back to sleep. \"After all, if it's the end of the world, there's nothing the president can do about it. If it isn't, it can almost always wait till breakfast.\" The [Los Angeles Times](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/), [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/pages/todayspaper/index.html), and the Wall Street Journal's world-wide newsbox lead with the latest from Iraq, where [tens of thousands](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-iraq28mar28,1,2737910.story) took to the streets in Baghdad to protest against the crackdown on Shiite militias that is being overseen by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. At least 125 people have been killed, but the Iraqi security forces seem no closer to getting rid of the militias in Basra [than when the offensive began on Tuesday](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/world/middleeast/28iraq.html?ref=todayspaper). The Green Zone was once again pounded by rocket and mortar attacks, which yesterday killed another American contract worker. The government imposed a curfew in Baghdad after explosions rocked the capital throughout the day and violence continued to rage in several cities. The WSJ highlights that a bomb was placed under an oil pipeline near Basra, which officials said could affect shipments and increase prices. In a Page One story, the WSJ highlights that the increasing violence once again threatens efforts to [lure big oil companies to Iraq](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120660810708368287.html?mod=todays_us_page_one). The [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/print/?nav=globetop) devotes most of its above-the-fold space to the role of U.S. forces in the Iraqi crackdown but leads with a look at how the actions taken by the Federal Reserve in the last couple of weeks could mark a vast expansion in the role of the [central bank in the future](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032703662.html). The Fed was just trying to deal with the current crisis, but many are now starting to recognize the actions will have long-lasting consequences. \"Whether we like it or not, they've recreated the financial universe,\" a finance professor declared. [USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080328/index.htm) leads with the [hundreds of flight cancellations](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080328/1a_lede28.art.htm) that passengers have had to deal with this week and warns there could be more to come as the Federal Aviation Administration continues cracking down on airplane safety. After problems were discovered in Southwest planes, the agency ordered all airlines to check for problems. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines canceled flights this week, and some suspect others will follow suit as the FAA continues its inquiry. President Bush declared yesterday that Iraq is returning to \"normalcy\" and praised the latest operation in Basra as a sign that the Iraqi government is [taking security matters seriously](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032700781.html?hpid=topnews). \"This offensive builds on the security gains of the surge and demonstrates to the Iraqi people that their government is committed to protecting them,\" [Bush said](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/world/middleeast/28iraq.html?ref=todayspaper). The WP [off-leads its Iraq story](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032700781.html?hpid=topnews) and says there are hints that U.S. troops are more involved in the fighting than military officials let on. One of the paper's correspondents saw U.S. troops in armored vehicles directly fighting Mahdi Army forces in Sadr City while Iraqi units largely stuck \"to the outskirts of the area.\" Throughout the day, \"the din of American weapons\" could be heard, and the WP pointedly declares that U.S. troops \"took the lead in the fighting.\" So U.S. forces are getting more involved in the conflict even as one American official admitted that \"we can't quite decipher\" the situation and figure out why the government decided to act now. But there's a growing consensus that Maliki is firing \"the first salvo in the upcoming elections,\" says the official, who then gives us the understatement of the day: \"It's not a pretty picture.\" U.S. military officials insist American troops are merely playing backup to Iraqi security forces, but commanders with the Mahdi Army say they've been fighting U.S. troops for the past three days. The LAT points out that U.S. officials are now in a strange situation where they have to [consistently talk about](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fg-iraq28mar28,1,2737910.story) how the crackdown is aimed at Shiite militias in general and insist that it's rogue elements of Muqtada Sadr's army that are to blame and not the cleric. Of course, they're worried that Sadr will officially call off his cease-fire. But as the WP [makes clear](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032700781.html?hpid=topnews), that cease-fire seems to exist in name only, since Sadr's \"fighters and Iraqi and U.S. forces are waging full-scale war in places.\" The NYT once again notes that there's \" [little evidence](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/world/middleeast/28iraq.html?ref=todayspaper)\" that Iraqi security forces in Basra are targeting anyone besides Mahdi Army fighters. Slate's [Fred Kaplan](http://www.slate.com/id/2187564/) plainly declares that the fighting in Basra \"is not a clash between good and evil or between a legitimate government and an outlaw insurgency. ... It's just another crevice in the widening earthquake called Iraq.\" The WP talks to [administration officials](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032700781.html?hpid=topnews) who say Maliki launched the offensive without consulting the United States. But the move couldn't have been that much of a surprise seeing as the NYT [reported on March 13](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/world/middleeast/13basra.html?scp=23&sq=basra&st=nyt) that the Iraqi army was planning an offensive to take control of Basra's port. The Post says that when the leaders of the Fed decided to open up what is \" [essentially a bottomless pit of cash](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032703662.html),\" which was previously available only to traditional banks, to large investment houses, they knew it was a big deal. The plan calls for that money to be available for at least the next six months, but even if it expires, the perception of how the Fed will act in a crisis has been forever changed. Experts now say that investment banks and their clients may be less worried about risky investments in the future since they will assume that the Fed will come to the rescue if there's a crisis. The question now is whether the Fed will formally take on a more heavy-handed approach to regulating Wall Street. The LAT and NYT front, while everyone else goes inside with, the proposals put forward by the presidential contenders to deal with [problems in the economy](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-campaign28mar28,1,419984.story). Sen. Barack Obama emphasized there should be more federal regulation of the financial markets, while Sen. Hillary Clinton proposed a plan to [retrain laid-off workers](http://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20080328/a_democrats28.art.htm). Obama put forward a $30 billion economic-stimulus package, and Clinton's aides took the opportunity to highlight that she had proposed to spend $30 billion to help prevent foreclosures (the country needs \"leadership, not followership,\" [they said](http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-campaign28mar28,1,419984.story)). Both the Democratic contenders [sharply criticized](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032703279.html) Sen. John McCain, who said the federal role should be limited because \"it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly, whether they are big banks or small borrowers.\" The NYT highlights that, despite the rhetoric, both parties have agreed that the government [should be involved](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/business/28regulate.html?ref=todayspaper), but \"the ideological clashes are ... more about whom it should try to rescue.\" In the end though, their results could be similar, since it's probably impossible to separate the individuals from the markets, because each would suffer if the other is doing badly. The NYT's [Paul Krugman](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/opinion/28krugman.html?ref=todayspaper) analyzes their proposals and says that, just as with health care, each candidate's policy tells \"a tale that is seriously at odds with the way they're often portrayed.\" McCain, who is often referred to as an independent maverick, \"offers neither straight talk nor originality\" as he offers traditional right-wing views. Obama is seen as \"a transformational figure,\" but his proposals \"tend to be cautious and relatively orthodox.\" For her part, Clinton, who \"we're assured by sources right and left, tortures puppies and eats babies,\" offers proposals that \"continue to be surprisingly bold and progressive.\" The Post takes a look at Obama's huge success in [raising funds through the Internet](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032702968.html) and says that in the past two months the senator has \"rewritten the rules of raising campaign cash.\" The key to his \"elaborate marketing effort,\" which involves spending heavily on Internet ads, seems to be that his campaign doesn't ask for money at every possible turn and instead has pursued a \"strategy of slow-walking its way into supporters' wallets.\" The WSJ reports that as foreclosures continue to increase, banks and mortgage companies are increasingly finding that homeowners [are taking revenge](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120665586676569881.html?mod=todays_us_page_one) by trashing their homes before handing over the keys. As a result, many are offering homeowners hundreds, or thousands, of dollars \"to put their anger in escrow and leave quietly.\" \"I'm embedded with the Americans in Iraq. As a Westerner, there is no more access to the insurgents' side. I don't claim to have any overview. History made my choice\u2014it's fine!\" \u2014Thomas Dworzak Photographs by Thomas Dworzak Produced by Adrian Kelterborn Good lawyers usually don't take their cases to the Supreme Court unless they have a strong chance of winning. By the same token, good wartime presidents don't announce that the fighting has reached \"a defining moment\" unless there's a strong chance that it will resolve in their favor or they believe that by rhetorically raising the stakes, they'll spur their troops to victory. Yet President George W. Bush did just that last week, after Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki sent troops\u2014backed by U.S. air power and (we've since learned) Marines and special-ops forces\u2014into the southern city of [Basra](http://www.slate.com/id/2187564/) in an effort to crush Muqtada Sadr's radical Shiite militia and, by extension, its political base. As a result of this needless hype, the clash\u2014which, on its own terms, ended in stalemate\u2014took on the air of a defeat, and in many dimensions. To call the battle \" [a defining moment](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/middleeast/03basra.html)\" was to declare that its outcome would define the state of the struggle. And that state does not look good in the aftermath. Maliki wound up a loser because he launched the offensive, demanding that Sadr's militiamen surrender their weapons\u2014then, a few days later, agreed to a cease-fire that kept the militia armed. Bush lost because he backed the campaign with America's armed might and his own proclamation. The Iraqi army lost because its commanders and troops revealed all too clearly that they're still unable to lead a successful battle. The U.S. Army lost because its troops are now doomed to stay in Iraq for still longer than they might have been led to believe. (The five \"surge\" brigades will go home in July, as scheduled; but the case will now be made that the Iraqi army's poor showing in Basra means we can't prudently withdraw more of our own troops just yet.) Who won? Sadr won because his Mahdi Army resisted the offensive\u2014at the same time that his men continued to abide by his moratorium on attacking U.S. troops directly (in other words, he showed himself both militarily effective and politically in control). And the Iranians won because Maliki turned to them to mediate the cease-fire with Sadr, thus confirming their status as a major player in Iraqi politics and a dominant power on Iraq's southern port. (The Iranians probably would have won no matter what happened, because the rival Shiite militia backing Maliki\u2014the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq, [10,000 members](http://www.juancole.com/2008/04/badr-inducted-into-army-as-thousands.html) of which fought alongside the official army\u2014also has ties to Iran. Maliki afterward admitted those 10,000 into the national armed forces. Does this mean that the ISCI militia has been co-opted into the Iraqi government\u2014or that the government is, even more than before, controlled by the militia?) This week, Bush traveled to Europe, a less confounding part of the world, for the annual conference of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, held this year in Bucharest. Yet here, too, he behaved like a bad lawyer\u2014and did more harm than good to those whose cause he advocated, in this case the new (if somewhat shaky) democracies of Ukraine and Georgia. Leading up to the NATO conference, Bush assured those leaders that he would push for their admission into the alliance. The problem was that he hadn't checked with the other members first. When most of those other members voted down the proposal, for a variety of reasons, the Ukrainians and Georgians felt insulted and humiliated\u2014understandably so. Their hopes had been raised and then dashed\u2014all in public. NATO did release a statement noting that the two nations might be admitted someday. If Bush hadn't made his baseless promises ahead of time, the document might have been read as an assurance. But, under the circumstances, it seemed like a brushoff. Again, Bush turned the status quo into defeat. Why? The [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/world/europe/03nato.html?ref=world) quoted a \"senior official\" as saying that Bush wanted to \"lay down a marker\" for his legacy. First, Bush may be thinking about his legacy, but the other Western leaders will have to live and lead in Europe after he's out of power. Second, what kind of marker is it to tick off Ukrainians and Georgians for no good reason and to pile another layer of uncertainty and awkwardness onto the whole panoply of East-West relations? As Casey Stengel once screamed, \"Can't anybody here play this game?\" That was when he was manager of the New York Mets in the team's first season. Bush has been in power now for seven years and two and a half months. It's unbelievable that he has nine and a half months\u2014enough time for more \" [birth pangs](http://www.slate.com/id/2146392/)\"\u2014to go. Soon after checking in to my hotel room, I discover a mouse in the bathroom. Three mice, in fact. One is imprinted on the bar of soap. One peers out from the shampoo label. And a third, on closer inspection, is a washcloth\u2014ingeniously folded by hotel staff to create two protruding, terrycloth ears. I'm growing used to these rodentophilic touches. Earlier today, as I drove into the enormous Walt Disney nation-state here in Florida, I noticed a tall electrical stanchion topped with a pair of Mickey ears. Soon after, I spotted a water tower with the ears painted in black. When it comes to branding, Disney's aim is total immersion. Which is good, because that's my aim, too. I'm here to envelop myself in the Disney World experience. I've obtained lodging deep within the compound, at a Disney-owned resort. I've bought a $280 multiday pass, granting access to more Disney attractions than any person could reasonably endure. For the next five days, I plan not to stray beyond the borders of the Disney empire. (Don't worry, that still leaves me 47 square miles, an area roughly twice the size of Manhattan, in which to roam.) Why on earth would I, a childless adult, visit Disney World by myself? Basically, to figure out what the hell's going on in this place. Because America has clearly decided it's hallowed ground. More than 100,000 people visit Disney World every day. I went when I was a kid. Nearly all my friends went. A few went more than once. Heck, I know Jews who weren't bar mitzvahed but did go to Epcot. Somehow, this cluster of amusement parks has grown into a rite of American childhood. Kids are born with homing beacons set for Orlando. Meanwhile, parents\u2014despite the hefty costs\u2014often seem just as eager or more so to make the pilgrimage. My question is: What exactly are we worshipping at this mecca? Day 1: Epcot I drive the three minutes from my hotel and ditch my rental car in the lot. After swiping my pass-card and getting my fingerprint scanned (a new security measure), I enter through Epcot's gates. Once inside, I'm immediately jaw-dropped by the looming mass of Spaceship Earth. It's tough to ignore\u2014being a 16-million-pound, 180-foot-high disco ball. One of Walt Disney's personal rules for theme-park design involved a concept he curiously termed the wienie. A wienie is a show-stopping structure that anchors the park. It is meant be iconic and captivating, so that it lodges in your visual memory forever. Spaceship Earth is perhaps the wieniest of all wienies. And it announces right off the bat that Epcot will not be your standard kiddie fun park. Over at the Magic Kingdom, the wienie is the fairy-tale Cinderella Castle. Here, it's a geodesic sphere inspired by the theories of R. Buckminster Fuller. When I enter Spaceship Earth, I board a ride tracing the history of communication\u2014from the first written symbols to the advent of the personal computer. It's low season now, so there's a mercifully short wait for the ride. That's the good news. The bad news is that once the ride is under way, I discover that it's a vague, aimless snooze. Toward the end of it, we pass what I believe to be an animatronic Steve Jobs. He's pneumatically gesturing inside a replica of a 1970s California garage. When the ride is over, we spill into an area called \"Innoventions.\" It's sponsored by a company called Underwriters Laboratories, which specializes in product-safety compliance. Among the fun activities here for kids: Try to make a vacuum overheat! Also: See if you can fray the cord of an iron! (I'm not kidding about this. There are 9-year-old boys with furrowed brows attempting to cause product failures.) Several other exhibit halls surround Spaceship Earth. According to my guidebook, they feature \"subjects such as agriculture, automotive safety, and geography.\" Well gosh, that's what being a kid is all about! Inside a pavilion labeled \"The Land,\" I find myself being lectured on sustainable development. The lecture is delivered by the animated warthog from The Lion King. I can overhear the nice mom behind me trying to distract her whimpering toddler. \"Look honey,\" she says, reading from her Epcot brochure, \"the next ride is a 'voyage through amazing greenhouses and a fish farm!' \" The kid cries louder. Though I was only 8, I still remember the day Epcot opened in 1982. The TV networks treated the event as news, airing live coverage. Every kid in my third-grade class was desperate to see this wondrous new place. Once the fanfare faded, though, we began to sense that Epcot was a slightly odd duck. Disney had purposefully designed it to appeal more to young adults than to their offspring. It was bound to disappoint all but the nerdiest of children. It had been the largest private construction project in all of American history\u2014requiring three years and $1 billion to complete\u2014and in the end, it was essentially a tarted-up trade expo. A perusal of Disney history suggests that Epcot was in some ways the brainchild of the man himself. What Walt envisioned was an Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\u2014a real town, serving as a laboratory for cutting-edge ideas about urban planning. But after Walt died in 1966, his dream was gradually perverted into the theme park we see today. Sponsors were called in to defray the huge costs, and in return, Epcot's \"Future World\" exhibits became an ode to giant corporations. The automotive safety ride is brought to you by General Motors. The agricultural science ride is compliments of Nestl\u00e9. In his tome Vinyl Leaves: Walt Disney World and America (the title refers to the fake leaves on a Disney \"tree\"), mildly paranoid anthropologist Stephen M. Fjellman writes that Epcot's attractions are meant to \"convince us to put our lives\u2014and our descendants' lives\u2014into the hands of transnational corporate planners and the technological systems they wish to control.\" When I leave the Future World area, I walk around the Epcot lagoon to the other half of the park. Here I enter the \"World Showcase.\" It consists of 11 separate pavilions, each dedicated to a different nation. I like the idea of the World Showcase. And some of the architecture\u2014the faux Paris street scene, for example\u2014displays an astounding talent for mimicry. But if you've ever actually been outside America, this nod to the rest of the world is mostly just insulting. Half the pavilions have no cultural content at all. The Morocco complex is just souvenir stores selling carpets and fezzes. The ride meant to encapsulate Mexico is a collection of slapstick Donald Duck skits. (Donald loses his bathing suit while parasailing in Acapulco, Donald flirts with some caliente se\u00f1oritas, etc.) I guess none of this should surprise me. Lots of tourists view travel abroad as basically a chance to shop for regionally themed trinkets. By the early evening, it's getting dark, and both kids and adults are getting crankier. A lot of strollers get wheeled into corners as moms whisper-shout, \"Settle down, Hunter\" and \"You stop that right now, Madison.\" I'm also noticing a lot more people buying the $8.50 margaritas available next to the Mexico pavilion. I take this as my cue and head back to the parking lot. Tomorrow's another day\u2014and another theme park. The keynote attraction of Disney's Hollywood Studios, listed first on the park brochure, is something they call the Great Movie Ride. This ride purports to trace the history of American cinema. \"Travel through classic film scenes and Hollywood moments,\" the pamphlet promises. Eager to see what sort of curatorial stamp the Disney imagineers might put on this topic, I line up, wait my turn, and hop aboard a conveyor pod. Soon, I'm rolling along past various iconic movie stuff. There's Jimmy Cagney cracking wise. There's Humphrey Bogart wooing Ingrid Bergman. And oh, look, it's Sigourney Weaver battling an alien. (To my great disappointment, we at no point pass Debbie doing Dallas.) There are two big problems with this ride (besides there being no Debbie). First, as best I can tell, the kids sitting all around me have no idea who any of these actors are. Never seen any of these movies. They perk up solely at references to films that were released after 2005. Second, these aren't video clips we're watching: Those famous scenes are being performed by animatronic robots. They have waxy faces and whirring pneumatic limbs. Frankly, they're weird. And they, too, leave the kids completely cold. I'm sure \"audio-animatronic\" creatures were nifty when Disney pioneered them in the 1960s. They became possible after [Wernher von Braun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernher_von_Braun) lent his pal Walt Disney some magnetic computer tape\u2014the same kind that was used by NASA to synchronize its launches. (Pause to contemplate: Wernher von freaking Braun! He gave the world not only the V-2 rocket and the Saturn V superbooster, but also the means to create an android Sigourney Weaver. Perhaps the greatest innovation of all!) In 1964, an animatronic Abe Lincoln wowed the crowds at the New York World's Fair. People were convinced he was a live actor. Impressive achievement. Four decades later, though, who's impressed when a mannequin blinks and raises its eyebrows? Sadly for Disney, many well-known rides throughout all the parks\u2014even the famed Pirates of the Caribbean\u2014still rely on animatronics as a central selling point. I'm guessing that within a decade all these robot performers will get phased out. Robot Humphrey and Robot Sigourney will get powered down one final time, then tossed on a pile in some dark, archival closet. A few classics\u2014maybe android Abe\u2014will be left out on display to appease the nostalgists. However dated, it's still very Disney\u2014this notion that the ultimate entertainment is to watch a machine impersonate a human. It hints at Disney's core philosophy. If I had to choose a single word to describe the Disney theme parks, that word would be inorganic. Or, as a cultural studies post-doc might put it: \"Blah blah simulacra blah blah Baudrillard.\" As has been noted in many a dissertation, we visit Disney World to savor the meticulous construction\u2014physical, mythical, and emotional\u2014of a universe that's completely fake and soulless. But oh, how beautifully soulless it is. Upon leaving the Great Movie Ride, I walk down a facsimile of Sunset Boulevard. Here, I notice the asphalt under my feet has rubbed away in spots, revealing the old streetcar tracks beneath. Of course, there never was a streetcar. And its tracks were never paved over to make way for the automobile age. And that pavement was never subsequently eaten away by the ravages of time. In fact, this entire fake history came into being all at once, fully formed, plopped on top of some Florida scrub land. As famed Baudrillard scholar Michael Eisner announced at the opening of the park in 1989: \"Welcome to the Hollywood that never was and always will be.\" I think it's these interstitial moments\u2014the seamlessness and the attention to detail\u2014that really stun Disney visitors and stay with them long after they've left. The rides are great, sure, but every amusement park has rides. Disney creates fully realized narratives. Consider the Tower of Terror, located at the end of Sunset Boulevard. It's just a classic [drop tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drop_tower_(ride)), where the goal is to send your stomach up into your sinuses. A regular amusement park would put you in a windowed gondola, crank it up high, and drop it. But here the complicated back story is that we're visiting a haunted, 1930s-era Hollywood hotel. The hotel lobby contains accurate period furnishings\u2014battered velvet chairs, musty lampshades. As I wait in line, shuffling forward, I eavesdrop on the couple behind me. The woman (I've gathered she's from a show-business background) is marveling at Disney's set design. \"Look at the distressing on all the surfaces,\" she says with real admiration. \"That's not easy to do. You can't just let the set hang around and age for 50 years.\" She's right: The place is yellowed, stained, and cobwebbed to a perfect patina. You'd never guess the whole thing was built in 1994. After passing through the lobby, we're shown an expensively produced film about the hotel's haunted past. Then \"bellhops\" in [Barton Fink](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barton_Fink)-ish costumes lead us to our seats. And then, at last, the actual ride happens. It's about 45 seconds of screaming our tonsils out as we plummet down an elevator shaft. All that effort and ingenuity wrapped around such a simple thrill. But this is precisely what draws folks all the way to Disney World instead of to their local Six Flags. When the ride's done, I go back outside and watch people strolling down Hollywood Boulevard. It turns out that the most far-fetched fantasy in Disney World isn't the magic spells, the haunted buildings, or the talking animals. It's the fact that there aren't any cars. For the mostly suburban Americans visiting here, this whole pedestrianism concept is at once liberating and bewildering. People don't seem ready for it. On the one hand, they adore walking with their children in a totally safe environment (one that's outside and is not explicitly a shopping mall). On the other hand, they're getting extremely winded. It's pretty far to walk the whole park. \"Slow down! Stop walking so fast,\" I hear over and over\u2014sometimes from fat adults, other times from their chubby children. They sweat through oversize T-shirts. They breathe heavily with every step. Their plump calves go pink in the sunshine, contrasting with their bright white sneakers and socks. Self-propulsion appears to be a wholly unfamiliar challenge. Still, the rewards for their efforts are many. Around any given corner there might lurk Power Rangers, mugging for photographs. Sometimes a troupe of fresh-faced teens will suddenly materialize and perform dance numbers from High School Musical. Later, you can buy a multipack of High School Musical socks at one of the sidewalk souvenir stores. (OK, I actually bought some of these socks. They were for my 26-year-old sister. We share a refined sense of humor.) As the afternoon wanes, and I grow tired of the masses, I duck into the least-attended attraction I can find. It's called \"Walt Disney: One Man's Dream.\" Inside, there's a small museum dedicated to Walt's life and a theater screening a short biographical film. There are about 12 people in the auditorium when the film begins. One family leaves halfway through because their toddler is cranky. Poor Walt, I think to myself. One day you're chilling with Wernher von Braun, inventing lifelike robots. The next day you're just some dude who drew a mouse. (Hey, let this be a lesson to you, High School Musical brats. There will come a time when no one will be buying your licensed hosiery anymore. Who will sing and dance with you then? Allow me to answer: You will sing and dance alone.) The Imagineering Field Guide to Disney's Animal Kingdom reveals that the imagineers deliberately left the parking lots out in front of this Disney-style zoo as bleak and barren as they could. A wasteland, with no strips of grass to interrupt the endless asphalt slab. They wanted to heighten the contrast we feel when entering into the lush, wooded Animal Kingdom park. The scheme \"ensures that the immersion into nature ... will be very impactful.\" My first thought upon reading this was: Screw you, imagineers! Parking lots suck enough as it is. You're saying you made yours even more depressing than necessary, just so you could showcase some cutesy landscaping idea? Go imaginuck yourselves! Once I'd gotten this indignation out of my system, my second thought was: Gosh, they sure do put a lot of thought into this stuff. Leafing through these behind-the-scenes books (I also have The Imagineering Field Guide to Epcot) brings to light, yet again, the insane attention to detail you find at every Disney property. For instance, once you've made that transition from the parking lot, through the gates into the Animal Kingdom entrance area, the imagineers' next goal is to carefully orchestrate your first glimpse of the massive Tree of Life. (It's one of this park's two [wienies](http://www.slate.com/id/2187177/entry/2187178/)\u2014the other being a replica Mount Everest.) Various inclines, berms, and hollows have been arranged so that you're forced to ascend a small rise before suddenly stumbling onto a gorgeous, unimpeded view of the tree. (The tree itself is an impressive feat of engineering. And is, of course, totally fake.) I've been curious to see how this obsessive nano-focus would be reconciled with the challenges of a zoo. Live animals seem decidedly un-Disney, as they can't be compelled to perform a repeated, synchronized sequence. (Unlike an animatronic robot. Or a low-wage employee.) With the animals' free will involved, it's impossible to ensure that every guest will receive the same, focus-group-approved experience. This sort of thing makes the imagineers extremely uncomfortable. Their response was to make the animals into a sideshow. In many cases, you don't even get to watch the animals from a static viewing point, as you would at a regular zoo. Instead, there's a \"ride\" with a silly narrative structure (about, for instance, chasing poachers), during which you get quick, oblique glimpses of the animals as you speed by. The true stars of Animal Kingdom aren't the lions, apes, and elephants. The stars are the precision-crafted environments you walk through. Here, come with me as we visit the delightful little village of Harambe. Harambe is the perfect East African port town of your mind's eye. When you first come upon it, it's hard not to feel you've been teleported to Kenya. All the signs are in the right typeface. The buildings are lovingly dilapidated. The paint-color choices are perfect. (The imagineers say they took paint chip samples on research trips and did surface rubbings to get the building textures right.) Having traveled to Africa myself, I can tell you that Harambe gets only two minor details wrong. The first is that Africa has many more flies than this. And the second is that Africa has black people. Given the otherwise remarkable accuracy of Harambe's set design, I'm sort of surprised that Disney didn't manufacture 15,000 animatronic Africans. OK, so they did import a few actual, nonrobot Africans to work the snack stands. Jambo! But perhaps the bigger issue is: Where are the black tourists visiting the park? I've seen maybe two black families all day. As in the rest of Disney World, there are literally more French people here than African-Americans. Another population dynamic I've noticed: the dearth of children at this supposed family destination. I've seen lots of adult couples with no kids in tow. Even when there's a token toddler present, there are often six or seven grown-ups attached to it. I'm beginning to suspect it's the adults who really want to be here, while the kids are just serving as fig leaves. This theory is bolstered by a scene I witness while waiting in line for food. An elderly, gray-bearded gent is in front of me, trying to buy a soda, when all of a sudden he's interrupted by his twentysomething daughter, who is scurrying toward us. \"Daaaaaad! She's not tall enough to go on the ride!\" whines the woman, gesturing with a pout at the tiny girl clinging to her thigh. \"So now I can't go! And you wandered off!\" The man says nothing. \"Take her hand,\" the woman demands. The poor old fellow is mortified by this behavior (and is in the middle of his beverage transaction, to boot). But he silently takes his granddaughter's hand so his horrid daughter can go enjoy her fricking roller coaster. Admittedly, Disney has some pretty great roller coasters. Toward the end of the day, I walk over to Anandapur (a fake Himalayan village, complete with Tibetan-style prayer flags) and board the Expedition Everest ride. I'm seated in a rickety rail car, which creaks up to the top of the 200-foot mountain before swooping, banking, and dropping at insane speeds. Everyone screams together. It's a group outpouring of white-knuckle terror. When the ride's over and I disembark, I find I've broken out in a light sweat. My dazed fellow riders look at each other in total awe: Can you believe what we just went through? The same thing happens on the nearby Kali River Rapids ride. There are seven other people on my raft, and as we float down the rushing river, I can feel us starting to gel into a team. We shout warnings to each other when the white water rages ahead. (\"Look out, here it comes!\") We catch each others' eyes and can't help but smile. The little girl sitting next to me cackles every time we get hit with a splash. She's shouting, \"I'm soaked!\" with a big, adorable grin. If I've found one redeeming feature of the Disney World experience, it's the community spirit that's fostered when strangers all join together for a primal shriek of fear\u2014or joy. I've spent three straight days inside the Disney World fortress. The incessant magicalness is starting to wear on me. I'm feeling a need to escape Big Rodent's clutchy claws. At the same time, I don't want to risk too much corruption from outside influences. I'd rather not stray too far\u2014geographically or spiritually. The perfect compromise: a visit to Celebration. This insta-town was conceived by Disney, built on Disney-owned land, and initially managed by Disney executives (though the company has shed much of its involvement over time). And it's only a few miles from my hotel. I make the short drive, park my car downtown, and hop out for a look. I've long been a fan of planned communities. I once lobbied my editor at Newsweek to let me write a story about Co-op City\u2014those ugly brick apartment towers in the Bronx, N.Y., next to I-95. My resulting (very short) article included a quote terming Co-op City's architecture \"a disgrace to humanity.\" The piece also noted that Co-op City had been constructed on the rubble of an abandoned theme park. The park was called Freedomland, and it was the creation of a former Walt Disney associate. Celebration, though it wasn't built until the 1990s, was in some ways the creation of Walt himself. Walt's original plan for his Florida swampland was to create a brand-new living town\u2014the true [Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow](http://www.slate.com/id/2187177/entry/2187178/). Celebration is the belated (and mangled) realization of that dream. Walt had envisioned a high-tech, sci-fi city, in appearance not unlike Epcot's Future World area (monorails whizzing by and whatnot). That's not how things turned out. Celebration is instead backward looking, with neotraditional, faux-prewar houses. Its old-timey, Norman Rockwell vibe is less Future World and more [Main Street U.S.A.](http://www.wdwinfo.com/wdwinfo/guides/magickingdom/mkmain.htm) Celebration's planners were proponents of New Urbanism (in itself a somewhat nostalgic credo, what with its emphasis on marginalizing the automobile). The town's layout is pedestrian-friendly, the retail and restaurant district is a short stroll from many houses, and all the car garages are hidden in rear alleys not visible from the street. Sure enough, within moments of my arrival, I find myself smack in the middle of a New Urbanist/Rockwellian moment: children walking home from school together as a friendly crossing guard holds up his stop sign. The thing is, I can't help but wonder if these kids might be animatronic. Everything looks waaaaay too perfect. The town famously has a strict rulebook legislating things such as yard upkeep, what color your curtains can be, and what kind of furniture (if any) you can put on your porch. This results in a place so scrubbed of individuality that the houses seem to resent their human residents. All the streets here have the same power-washed gleam as the streets in the Disney theme parks. The neighborhoods have the same built-all-at-once aesthetic. I actually like some of the downtown buildings designed by shnazzy architects. (Favorites include the [toylike post office](http://architecture.about.com/od/plannedcities/ss/celebration_3.htm) by Michael Graves and the [retro cinema](http://architecture.about.com/od/plannedcities/ss/celebration_8.htm) by Cesar Pelli\u2014though I feel Philip Johnson's [town with its forest of pillars](http://architecture.about.com/od/plannedcities/ss/celebration_5.htm) is a facile, unfunny joke.) But having spent the last few days surrounded by maddeningly perfect Disney habitats, I'm now getting the sinking sense that I haven't escaped the Mouse at all. Celebration forces upon you the same seamless, manufactured experience you get when you walk through the \"villages\" of [Harambe and Anandapur](http://www.slate.com/id/2187177/entry/2187180/). The inhabitants of Celebration are essentially living inside a theme park. (We might call it Suburb Land.) Each night when the park shuts down, they're still inside the gates. In the evening, I decide to check out downtown Disney, back inside the fortress. It's basically a very high-end strip mall\u2014with a Planet Hollywood instead of an Applebee's, and a Virgin Megastore instead of a [Hot Topic](http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/index.jsp). I grab dinner at Bongos Cuban Caf\u00e9 (celebrity owner: Gloria Estefan) and then stroll over to Pleasure Island as it gets dark. Pleasure Island is where adults on vacation at Disney go at night to escape their children. Also here: businesspeople stuck in Orlando for conferences and locals who treat this as their regular hangout. (Pleasure Island doesn't require a Disney Pass.) There's a club for every taste, from the disco lounge (8-Trax) to the hip-hop spot (BET Soundstage) to the mainstream, top-40 dancehall (Motion). A single cover charge gets you in to all the clubs, all night. So people bounce back and forth among the venues. This creates the sort of nightlife melting pot that you rarely, if ever, find in the real world. Because it's Disney, and we all feel safe and emboldened, no one's afraid to venture into what might be perceived as alien territory. Nerdy white people stride confidently into the \"black\" club. Older couples wade onto dance floors packed with whippersnappers. Gay dudes sashay through the redneck-y rock club. (When I say that, I'm not trying to play on a stereotype. I literally watched three gay men prance about and do ballet jumps while the house band played Lynyrd Skynyrd. These guys were egging each other on, trying to get a rise out of the crowd, but none of the lumpy heteros seemed to pay any mind.) I find the whole scene oddly hopeful\u2014at first. If people can all get along together here, maybe we can bring that tolerance back home with us. As the night wears on, though, different groups begin to self-segregate. Early in the evening, for instance, I had a drink at a club called Mannequins. It had a mixed crowd: moms and dads in dorky khakis, some college-age kids getting blitzed, and one pair of gay guys dancing up a storm under the disco ball. I was heartened by the diversity. But it didn't last. When I popped back a few hours later, I ordered a drink and scanned the room again. It appeared the demographics had undergone a radical shift. Now there were 150 men positively swarming the rotating dance floor. They were accompanied by about three women. And I couldn't help but notice that these men, as a group, seemed extraordinarily handsome, trim, and well-dressed. Ohhhhhhhhhh. I suppose that name should have been a clue, now that I think about it. Anyway, it's all good in the Disney 'hood. When we envision a \"magic kingdom,\" we, each of us, have our own ideas. Inside every Disney theme park, you'll find at least one booth\u2014often more than one\u2014stocked with information about Disney Vacation Club Resorts. A nice man or woman will hand you a brochure, offer to take you on a tour of model rooms, and talk you through a few different time-share options. Apparently, it's a terrific deal if you want to bring your family back to Disney World every year. Query: Why would anyone want to go to Disney World every year? You can pretty much see the whole thing in a week. OK, fine, kids might like it enough to go back again\u2014once, or maybe twice. But this time share makes financial sense only if you return about seven times. Holy frack! I'd go mental if I had to spend seven precious vacations trapped inside the Disney universe. But let's put my personal feelings aside. Let's say you're a parent. Mightn't it be better to broaden your children's horizons just a tad? Like, maybe visit Canada\u2014instead of just the Canada pavilion in Epcot? According to Disney, there are more than 100,000 member families in the Vacation Club. These people have handed over all their foreseeable leisure time to the Walt Disney Co. It's an astonishing decision, no? And it's surely less about a destination than an ideology. We'll call it Disneyism. These families aren't choosing a vacation so much as a religion. Walt Disney, the man, is a singular character in American history. He gets his start as an animator, then becomes a movie mogul, an amusement park baron, and eventually a mythmaker\u2014a sort of unprecedented high priest of American childhood. By the mid-1960s, with his techno-utopian plans for the living city of Epcot, Walt had even turned into (in the words of anthropologist Stephen M. Fjellman) \"a social planner and futurist philosopher.\" It's these later incarnations of Walt that really fascinate me. The guy is sculpting the toddler id while also designing a domed metropolis with a monorail. How did this happen? A man who got famous drawing a cartoon mouse was now going to solve all America's urban problems? It's hard to think of a comparable career arc. But as a parallel, evil-twin figure, consider Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. He was born 10 years after Walt, also in heartland America. His career likewise took off on the strength of mass-market entertainments (in Hubbard's case, sci-fi). And then midcentury\u2014during that Atomic Age moment when everything somehow seemed possible\u2014he turned his attention to a grand, ego-gratifying social project of dubious utility. Who knows what ambitions might have bubbled up in Walt if he'd lived past 1966. But I think one way to look at his life is as L. Ron Hubbard gone good. This is a long way of saying: Disney isn't just a media outfit with some theme parks. It's a worldview\u2014sprung from the head of a lone, imaginative man. And ultimately, for the people who come back to Orlando year after year, it's a church. On my last day here, I visit the Magic Kingdom\u2014the original and still best-attended of the Disney World parks. After walking down Main Street U.S.A. (a fake, turn-of-the-century boulevard lined with yet more Disney souvenir stores), I come upon the famous Cinderella castle. Fairy-tale spires everywhere. It's so gleaming, it looks like they repaint it every night. (Over the last several years, furthering my Disney-as-religion theory, the castle has become a prime location for wedding ceremonies. Up to five weddings per day are held on Disney World's grounds. Mickey and other characters will even attend your wedding reception. For a fee.) As I get closer to the castle, I see the familiar Disney apostles (Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Goofy) performing musical numbers on a stage, enthralling a large crowd. The lyrics to their songs shuffle around a few key words\u2014dreams, magic, imagination, wonder\u2014and weave them into some upbeat string arrangements. Hymns for the Disneyist congregation. Many of the little girls watching this are wearing princess dresses (bought at those souvenir stores). For years, Disney must have sought a boys' version of the princess obsession, and it seems they've finally found it\u2014thanks to the blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean films. Lots of little dudes are running around in pirate costumes, waving plastic swords. Disney has increasingly managed to find characters to leverage for each different demographic group. Tinkerbell, from Peter Pan, has been rebranded as the slightly saucier \"Tink\" and now graces T-shirts targeted at your tween daughter. Meanwhile, your death-metal son will be drawn to the skull-and-bones imagery of The Nightmare Before Christmas franchise. Even adults wear Disney gear here. There are moms in Mickey ears and dads with giant sorcerer hats. This is a safe place for everyone to act like a kid, and I'll admit there's a certain sweetness about that. I'm not a fan of the gender dynamic implicit in the princess/pirate split. (Visiting Mickey and Minnie's side-by-side houses does little to reassure me on this score. Mickey's house has a nonfunctioning kitchen and is full of sports equipment, while Minnie has a to-do list on her wall with the entries \"Bake a cake for Mickey\" and \"Make a box lunch for Mickey.\") Still, my heart melts when I see a little girl wearing a princess dress while sitting in her wheelchair, beaming ear to ear as her even beamier parents take pictures. I can understand why families love Disney World. And there's nothing wrong with making kids happy. I just think we'd all be better off if we didn't indoctrinate our kids in the Disneyist dogma. After spending the past five days here, I've come to the conclusion that Disney World teaches kids three things: 1) a meaningless, bubble-headed utopianism, 2) a grasping, whining consumerism, and 3) a preference for soulless facsimiles of culture and architecture instead of for the real thing. I suppose it also teaches them that monorails are cool. So there's that. I end my day with the \"It's a Small World\" ride. Yes, it's a prime example of bubble-headed utopianism. Yes, it features animatronics, which are dated and lame. And yes, that song just never ends. No matter: The ride somehow manages to charm me anyway. Designed for the UNICEF pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair, it shows us children of many cultures all living in harmony. (A color-saturated, Pop Art harmony.) It's an unassailable message, and there's also something comforting in the ride's retro simplicity. Our open-top boat floats along, and I love the gentle bump and redirect when it hits an underwater guide rail. I even have a soft spot for the music. (Though I prefer to reimagine it as a slow, melancholy ballad.) As I leave the park, I decide that after all my cranky complaining, I'm glad my week came to an end this way. \"It's a Small World\" makes for a nice, pleasant memory to finish on. I'm feeling positive about Disney again. And then there's an incident on the parking tram. I'm seated on the tram, ready to ride back out to the parking lot where my rental car's waiting. The driver has already blown the horn and announced that no more boarding will be allowed. Suddenly, I notice a woman 20 yards away, running toward us. The driver spots her too. The tram is in motion now, and he screams over the loudspeaker: \"Ma'am! Stand back! There is no more boarding!\" But the woman can see that there's no real danger here\u2014the vehicle is moving at, like, 3 miles an hour\u2014and fer crissakes she doesn't want to wait 15 minutes for another tram if she doesn't have to. The driver keeps shouting. The other passengers are tut-tutting at this rule-breaker. The tram keeps rolling. The woman is getting nearer. As I watch all this, I start to think about the totalitarian seamlessness of Disney. The berms that hide the loading docks and the Dumpsters. The fireworks that go off every night at precisely 9 p.m. The impeccably G-rated entertainment. The synchronized rides. The power-washed streets. \"Ma'am!\" the driver yells again, with real exasperation. She's just a few strides away, with her eyes on that slow-moving prize. \"Ma'am, there is no more boarding at this time!\" I can't help but break into a satisfied grin as the woman hops up on the running board and takes a seat.
