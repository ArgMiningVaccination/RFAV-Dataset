Among the most significant events of the past year was the approval and launch of the Wiscons in Partnership Program's 2019 -2024 Five -Year Plan. Since its inception, the Wisconsin Partnership Program has worked to improve health in Wisconsin. Its investments include research to understand, prevent and cure diseases; education and training programs to prepare health profession als to meet the evolving needs of Wisconsin's patients and populations ; and community partnerships to address critical public health issues. The 2019 -2024 Five -Year Plan represents a transition in the Partnership Program's strategy for improving health. Just as the health challenges facing our state are evolving, so is our approach to addressing them. While the scope of \"public health\" still includes traditional public health , issues such as immunizations and tobacco use , we recognize the need to expand our view in a way that embrac es the role that social determinants can play in achieving health equity and improving health outcomes. Factors such as housing quality, education al opportunities, social connections and employment status influence the risks and outcomes for diseases such as cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's, as well as overall health status . Please take a moment to read more about the updated goals on the following page. These goals, as well as the Partnership Program's grant -making activities , reflect a forward -thinking vision and commitment to improv e health and advanc e health equity in Wisconsin. We look forward to doing our part to ensure that the people of Wisconsin will live full and healthy lives in communities that are also healthy an d vibrant. We are grateful to our partners across campuses and communities, including those highlighted in this report and many more, who work on a daily basis to bring this vision to fruition. Sincerely, Robert N. Golden, MD Robert Turell Professor in Medical Leadership Dean, UW School of Medicine and Public Health Vice Chancellor for Medical Affair s University of Wisconsin -Madison Overview (draft - 2019 annual report) - The Wisconsin Partnership Program at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health is committed to bringing about lasting improvements in health and well -being and advancing health equity through investments in community partnerships, ed ucation and research. It aspires to the vision that everyone in Wisconsin will live full and healthy lives. To date, the Wisconsin Partnership Program has awarded 489 grants totaling over $228.5 million, and has supported projects in every county in Wisco nsin. Its investments support a broad range of projects, spanning basic, clinical and translational research, education and workforce development, and public health initiatives. The Partnership Program is governed by t wo committees comprised of faculty a nd community members. The Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) directs and approves funds for public health initiatives. The Partnership Education and Research Committee (PERC) allocates funds for medical, education and research initiatives aimed at impr oving population health. Their combined expertise and backgrounds guide the Partnership Program's processes for reviewing and awarding grants and evaluating outcomes. Expanding Our Vision: The 2 019-2024 Five -Year Plan In March 2019, the Wisconsin Partners hip Program launched its 2019 -2024 Five -Year Plan. The plan, which was developed over the course of the previous year, outlines how the Partnership Program will achieve progress toward its mission to improve health and well -being in Wisconsin. The Wiscons in Partnership Program remains comm itted to improving health by supporting community partnerships and education and research initiatives that fuel knowledge, scientific discovery and innovations in h ealth and healthcare delivery. In addition, the 2019 -2024 Five-Year Plan represents a transition in the Partnership Program's approach to improving health and reducing health disparities, recognizing that to truly improve health for everyone, we must expand our view of health with an explicit focus on health equ ity. This expanded view aligns with emerging evidence and research from institutions including the National Institutes of Health, the Center for Disease Control and the R obert Wood Johnson Foundation, that support an expanded view of public health , recogni zing that the health of a community and its people depends on a strong and stable foundation. Housing quality, access to healthy food, income stability, social inclusion and educational opportunities are some of the things that help build that foundation a nd impact health and well -being over the course of a lifetime. The Partnership Program's steadfast commitment to improving health and advancing health equity is reflected in the Five -Year Plan's goals. These goals drive its investments in research, educati on and community partnerships: Promote Innovation: To address complex health challenges, we will invest in new and evolving ideas and discoveries and their successful introduction into practice. Build Capacity and Leadership: To meet the emerging health and healthcare needs of our state, we will enhance knowledge, skills and abilities of our community partners, applicants and grantees, as we learn from them as well. Advance Health Equity: To achieve health equity, we will address the root causes of health inequities and the roles played by the social determinants of health. Catalyze System Change: To improve health and well -being of the people of Wisconsin, we will work to improve policies and practices within the many diverse systems influencing health Mouse icon: View the Five -Year Plan Please view our 2019 -2024 Five -Year Plan to learn more about the values that guide these goals and the strategies that will support them. In addition, see page XX of this report to learn more about how we are reaching the se goals through our grant programs. place : updated pie chart: Grants Awards by Type: 2004 - June 30, 2019 Public Health and Community Research Grants ($111.9 M 49%); Basic Science Research Grants ($12.7 M; 6%); Clinical and Translational Research Gr ants ($72.2 M 32%); Public Health Education and Training Grants ($32.1 14%) Grants Awarded 2004 -June 30, 2019 489 grants $228.5 million Grants Awarded July 1, 2018 -June 30, 2019 34 grants $20.2 million The Wisconsin Partnership Program was established at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health in 2004 through a generous endowment gift from Blue Cross Blue Shield United of Wisconsin's conversion to a stock insurance corporation. The Partnership Program expresses its continued gratitude for this gift to benefit the people of Wisconsin. Research Reducing Health Disparities across Wisconsin Health Systems A new study released in September 201 9 by the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality (WCHQ) and supported by the Wisconsin Partnership P rogram, provides a unique set of data that sheds light on how patients experience healthcare \u2014and health disparities \u2014across Wisconsin health systems and medical clinics. The WCHQ Health Disparities Report was developed in collaboration between WCHQ and th e University of Wisconsin Health Innovation Program (HIP) and co -authored by Maureen Smith, MD, MPH, PhD, Professor, Departments of Population Healt h Sciences and Family Medicine and Community Health and Matt Gigot, WCHQ director of performance measurement and analysis. The work is supported through a four -year strategic grant from the Partnership Program's Partnership Education and Research Committee (PERC) . The study identifies where gaps in health outcomes and care exist in Wisconsin. The data is categor ized based on race and ethnicity, insurance coverage and geography . The data was submitted to WCHQ by 25 health systems and medical clinics and it represents the most complete and recent (2018) data available for this work. The measures selected for the report include: vaccinations, screenings, risk factors and chronic disease. The report found that some people in Wisconsin are experiencing a wide range of substantial disparities across several measures. (see sidebar) The Wisconsin Partnership Program recognizes that the most effective way to eliminate health disparities is through collaboration among many partners across campuses, communities, clinics and health systems as well as other public and private entities. Dr. Smith acknow ledges how instrumental partnerships were to the success of this project. \"This project could not have been achieved without the partnerships among WCHQ, HIP, the participating health systems \u2014and their impressive commitment to share data \u2014 and support fro m the Partnership Program.\" \"Wisconsin's health systems play a key role in eliminating health disparities, and they have worked diligently to continue to improve the quality of c are they deliver,\" says Greg Nycz, Executive Director, Family Health Center o f Marshfield, Inc. and PERC member. \"We know that measurement is an effective way to monitor health disparities, and we believe by illuminating and reporting on these measures within individual health systems, the systems will be motivated to pursue positi ve change in these areas.\" The project team recognizes that improving health outcomes across communities will require more than the attention and efforts of the individual health systems. \"Our goal was to identify and report disparities to promote public a ccountability, improvement, and action by multiple stakeholders,\" says Dr. Smith. \"However, to reduce disparities, stakeholders may need focused efforts to address selected measures, as well as strategies that address the root causes of poor health, such a s poverty, housing, food insecurity and other factors. The Partnership Program has also invested in initiatives aimed at reducing health disparities at the system -level at Marshfield Clinic Health System and Sixteenth Street Community Health Center (see page x). In addition, the Partnership's investments in medical education and training support a curriculum that emphasizes health equity. This ensures that future physicians and public health leaders are prepared to address health disparities within communit ies and health systems. \"This project is an important strategic investment that aligns directly with our goal to advance health equity and improve health and well -being for everyone in Wisconsin,\" says Richard Moss, PhD, SMPH Senior Associate Dean and PERC Chair. \" It's our hope that this innovative resource can be used to catalyze efforts to reduce health disparities within clinical settings, and serve as a call to action to policy makers, employers and communities to develop appropriate approaches to addre ssing these health gaps as well.\" Chris Queram, WCHQ President/CEO, acknowledges that improving health is good for communities and good for business too. \"Health equity is a community strength and an economic development asset. People want to live and work in areas where everyone has an equal opportunity to be healthy,\" Queram said. \"This report will help us get a step closer to that goal.\" Sidebar The report found that some people in Wisconsin are experiencing a wide range of substantial disparities across several measures. Substantial was defined as 10 percent lower than the best performing group. - Blacks are experiencing substantial disparities for childhood vaccinations, maintaining recommended weight, blood pressure control and not using tobacco if they have diabetes or health disease; - All the groups included in the report, except Asian which had the best rate, were not at the recommended weight; - There were substantial disparities in the American Indian population in childhood vaccinations, breast cance r screening and tobacco use related to diabetes and health disease - Whites had the lowest rate of HPV vaccination Mouse icon Read the full report at wchq.org/disparities.php . Education: Preparing Future Public Health Leaders The Wisconsin Partne rship Program has supported many UW School of Medicine and Public Health educational initiatives over the past 15 years , including Transforming Medical Education, the Wisconsin Academy for Rural Medicine, th e Master of Public Health degree program, the Popula tion Health Service Fellowship and the Preventive Medicine Residency. These programs engage students and trainees beyond the classroom and provide opportunities for skill and leadership development to ens ure the next generation of healthcare professionals is prepared to serve patients and communities across the state. The Partnership Program has supported the Population Health Service Fellowship Program since its inception in 2004. The program is a corners tone of the Partnership's educational investments and continues to successfully achieve its goals of both public health workforce development and service contributions to rural and urban communities. The Fellowship Program places early career public healt h professionals in local and state government and community organizations to tackle some of the state's most pressing health issues. These placements provide fellows with opportunities to gain professional experience, build skills and develop connections within the public health field. To date, 80 masters - or doctoral -prepared fellows from diverse backgrounds have been placed in more than 40 local and state public health an d community -based organizations. The number of graduating fellows currently contribut ing to, or leading , Wisconsin's public health workforce continues to grow, with 69 percent of fellows currently staying in Wisconsin . Paula Tran Inzeo, MPH, a former fellow and current director of the UW SMPH Mobilizing Action Toward Community Health Grou p says, \"The Fellowship Program truly catalyzes career trajectory. Fellows have the opportunity to work and lead at a much higher level than th ey would have if they had taken entry - level public health jobs. This opportunity, combined with the networks they build, creates a career launching pad not available elsewhere.\" The fellows are widely recognized for their outstanding contributions to the organizations and communities they serve. Specifically, fellows have contributed to the receipt of more than $1.4 million in grants addressing maternal and child health, as well as efforts to address Ebola preparedness, immunizations, response to flu and improving health outcomes for those living with AID S/HIV. Thomas Oliver, PhD, MHA, MA, a professor in the Department of Population Health Sciences and director of the Fellowship Program, is pleased with the contributions the fellows are making and their commitment to the state. He says, \"It is truly remarkable that many of the Fellowship alum remain in Wisconsin, given that they come from all over the country. Not only are they learning and working here \u2014they are building their careers and lives in Wisconsin as well.\" With the recent launch of its fifteenth coh ort of fellows, the scope of the program continues to evolve. It is deepening its focus on health equity and is broadening its geographic reach to more rural and tribal communities in an effort to address the unique health challenges facing many Wisconsin communities. Says Oliver, \"The Fellowship Program is emblematic of the mission of the Partnership Program to improve health and health equity in Wisconsin. Our program continues to grow and evolve in ways that make that vision likely, thanks to the Partne rship Program's investments in education and people.\" Sidebar Creating Fellowship The Population Health Services Program is a fellowship in the true sense of the word. Through its learning communities and partnerships with preceptors across the state, a network of public health learners and leaders flourishes and benefits organizations and communities in multiple ways. Kristie Egge, a community health planner with the Wood County Public Health Department, serves as preceptor for the Fellowship Program. She reflects on this role as one of her most impactful and rewarding experiences, bo th professionally and personally. Through monthly Learning Community meetings, fellows and preceptors build their network, gain knowledge and have the chance to share and problem -solve with other public health leaders in the state. Niki Euhardy, who recent ly graduated from the fellowship program and served as a fellow for Wood County Health Department, is now working as a public health policy and equity coordinator with the Winnebago Public Health Department. She says, \"Nothing could have prepared me for a public health career the way this fellowship has. There were so many opportunities to try new ideas, build self -confidence, make statewide connections and grow as a leader. I hope to be able to give back to the program as a preceptor myself one day.\" Kristie echoes the value of the program. \"Our health department would not be where it is today without Niki's contributions and leadership on many important projects. It's amazing when you think of how significantly the Fellowship Program and its fellows have contributed to the field of public health and to society.\" Learn more about the Population Health Service Fellowship Program at wiphfellowship.org. Community Partnerships : Improving Health by Addressing Housing Instability The health of a community de pends on a strong and stable foundation. Income stability, housing quality and affordability , access to healthcare and educational opportunities help build that foundation. Through its Community Impact Grant Program, the Wisconsin Partnership Program suppo rts initiatives designed to improve health and advance health equity by building strong foundations for health. A grant to Sixteenth Street Community Health Center, Milwaukee's largest federally qualified health center , supports the organization's work to build a strong foundation of community health by addressing housing instability in its community. Sixteenth Street serves nearly 40,000 patients in a vibrant Southside Milwaukee community. Last year, 86 percent of patients were Hispanic, 72 percent best s erved in a language other than English, and 79 percent of those whose income is known, reported it below 100 percent of the poverty level. System barriers , such as complex insurance and health and social service information , have created roadblocks for mem bers of this multicultural community to access some of the basic building blocks to health. Wisconsin Partnership Program funding supports the development and implementation of a patient screening tool to identify foundational health concerns , such as housing. Community v olunteers screen patients to identify needs and connect them to patient and resource navigators , who help patients access appropriate services and resources to meet their needs. The mod el includes data sharing across agencies to ensure sustainable, system ic change to how Sixteenth Street addres ses housing and the other basic building blocks for health. Systemic changes are too large to be made by one organization working alone, which is why partnerships are essential. Project Ma nager and Director of Health Education and Community Programs Jose Salazar says, \"By working together and formalizing relationships with other community agencies , we are redefining a system to better provide supp ort that is seamless, proactive and ultimate ly more effective in improving health.\" A critical partner in this work is the Milwaukee Health Care Partnership, which includes local health systems, co mmunity health centers and government health agencies, all working together to reduce fragmentation to ensure that no one slips through the cracks \u2014which happens all too fre quently under the current, siloed syste m. Housing instabili ty, which includes homelessness and overcrowded properties, as well as structural problems with mold and lead , is one of the gre atest threats to health in the Sixteenth Street community. The chronic stress caused by these housing challenges exacerbates many of Sixteenth Street patients' most diagnosed health issues, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, depression and anxiety. Julie Schuller, MD, a practicing physician for 25 years before becoming Sixteenth Street's president and chief executive officer, says, \"As doctors, we recognize patients have these issues impacting their health, but there is only so much we can do within the context of an exam visit.\" As an example, she shares the sto ry of a patient with allergies who developed asthma. Though she treated the asthma at the clinic, the patient had mold in her low -income housing apartment and an uncooperative landlord. Her housing voucher made it difficult to move. Dr. Schuller asks, \"How can we address this? We want to take care of people b eyond the exam room \u2014where they live, work and play \u2014 but doctors don't have expertise in housing and social services. Projects like this p rovide the expertise to augment what we're able to do in the exam room.\" \"In addition,\" says Rosamaria Martinez, Vice -President of Community Health Initiatives, \"trust is essential to the initiative's success. Many staff members live in the community and w ant to make sure their community's needs are recognized. \" She says, \"We are committed to our community and want to make sure the people \u2014both within and beyond our clinic walls \u2014have what they need to live healthy lives.\" Our state thrives when communities have strong foundations for health. Healthcare systems like Sixteenth Street play an important role in building these foundations by addressing issues impacting health and well -being within their communities. Says Dr. Schuller, \"This project allows us to c ontribute to health not only in the clinic setting, but within our broader community as well.\" Evaluation and Impact Since its inception, the Wisconsin Partnership Program has invested in research, education and community partnerships to solve complex health challenges from the cellular to the clinical to the community level. This approach has led to innovation in healthcare and scientific discovery , future healthcare providers and public health leaders who are among the best -prepared in t he nation, and communities forging paths toward addressing their unique health needs. Improving health is a complex and complicated undertaking ; and so too is measuring impact . To date, the Partnership Program has measured its impact based on the aggregat ed achievements of individual grantees. These accomplishments have been reported annually in its published Outcomes Report . The Partnership Program also measures outcomes and impact based on indicators including: the return on investment through leveraged funding from external funders dissemination and publication of project findings outcomes specific to grant programs, such as the career development of faculty/principal investigators within the New Investigator Grant Program However, the Partnership's unde rstanding of what creates health is evolving, and takes into consideration the complexity of the factors that influence change and ultimately, success in achieving its overall goal of improving health and well -being and advancing health equity for all Wisc onsin communities . Improving the health of Wisconsin communities means tackling challenges that are dynamic, non -linear and that have result ed from a multitude of independent factors that influence each other in often unpredictable ways. Therefore, measur ing the Partnership Program's impact on health cannot be solely attributed to the accomplishments of its grantee portfolio . The Program's approach to evaluation is changin g to reflect this understanding. To successfully understand and measure its impact, t he Partnership Program is enlisting external evaluation expertise to help answer the following questions. 1. To what extent are the Partnership Program's investments in research, education and community partnerships in alignment with its overall goals and obj ectives of improving health and well -being for everyone in Wisconsin ? 2. What is the potential impact of its grant programs and processes to achieve health equity ? 3. What are appropriate indicators of individual, com muni ty and system -level outcomes attributable to its grantmaking? The answers to these questions will shape how the Wisconsin Partnership Program approaches its work going forward. Ultimately, the responses will reflect if the Partnership Program is using its resources most effectively to achieve its desired goals. Searchable Grants Web Page to Launch January 2020 The Partnership Program is transitioning from a printed outcomes report publication that captures outcomes within the fiscal reporting period, to a searchable, interactive grants web page. The new Funded Projects web page will pilot December, 2019 with summary pages of concluded grants for the period July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019.

View the new grants page: new url coming The Wisconsin Partnership Program's investments in research, education and community partnerships focus on four main goals. These goals address what it believe s are the critical elements to achieving greater health in Wisconsin. The selected grant highlights below show how the Partnership Program is reaching its goals. Within graphic: Promote Innovation Early diagnosis and treatment decrease the risk of severe vision loss from diabetic eye disease, but fewer than half of the 29.1 million Americans with diabetes receive yearly eye screenings. A recent study supported by the Wisconsin Partnership Program addressed barriers to diabetic eye screening. The findings h elped to advance the use of teleophthalmology for eye screening at Mauston's Mile Bluff Medical Center, the only full -service hospital in a six -county area of central Wisconsin. The innovative telehealth program has dramatically boosted diabetic eye scree ning, with the health system seeing a 35 percent increase over three years. The new model serves as a blueprint for other health systems in Wisconsin and nationally for building teleophthalmology programs. Catalyze System Change An innovative research pro ject brings together UW investigators and health system partners to measure and publicly report disparities in the quality of care for 22 healthy systems in Wisconsin. The four -year project is led by the UW SMPH Health Innovation Program and the Wisconsin Collaborative for Healthcare Quality. By measuring and reporting disparities in quality, this project is expected to facilitate change efforts by health systems and other organizations and ultimately benefit Wisconsin's most vulnerable citizens. The projec t team released their first report in September 2019. (Read more on page x) Advance Health Equity A recent study supported by the Wisconsin Partnership Program and led by UW researchers has identified a spec ific genetic vulnerability in Hmong people that renders them more susceptible to blastomycosis, an uncommon fungal infection. The findings can help physicians make better -informed and timely decisions about treatment for people who are at higher risk for this infection . Additionally, this work has the potential to extend health benefits to the population at large as more personalize d approaches to medicine are established. Build Capacity and Leadership With support from the Wisconsin Partnership Program, the UW SMPH has established itself as a leader and national model for its comprehensive educational approach as a fully integrated school of medicine and public health. The Partnership Program's contin ued investments in education, training and workforce development prepare future physicians and health professionals to care for both patients and populations. Initiatives supported by the Partnership Program include Transforming Medical Education and its innovative ForWard curriculum, the Wisconsin Popula tion Health Ser vices Fellowship, the Wisconsin Academy for Rural Medicine, Preventive Medicine Residency , and the Master of Public Health (MPH) Program.

The UW School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) has designed a review process for determination of nonsupplanting, which was approved by the Wisconsin United for Health Foundation, Inc. Based on the nonsupplanting determination made by the Senior Associate Dean for Finance, the Dean of the School of Medicine and Public Health has attested to compliance with the supplanting prohibition in this Annual Report. The UW -Madison Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration also has atteste d that UW -Madison and the UW System have complied with the supplanting prohibition. OAC Review and Assessment of the Allocated Percentage of Funds As outlined in its founding documents, the Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) annually reviews and asse sses the allocation percentage for public health initiatives and for education and research initiatives. T he OAC will take up the matter on October 16, 2019. It was moved to retain the allocation of 35 percent for public health initiatives and 65 percent f or education and research initiatives, and the motion was unanimously passed. Accounting The following financial reports consolidate activities of the Wisconsin Foundation and Alumni Association (WFAA) and the SMPH for the fiscal year ending June 30, 201 9. The Wisconsin Partnership Program changed its reporting period to a fiscal year ending June 30th effective June 30, 2017. Revenues consist of interest income and changes in market valuation of investments, while expenditures consist of administrative a nd program costs. All expenditures and awards are reported as either public health initiatives (OAC - 35 percent) or Partnership Education and Research Committee initiatives (PERC - 65 percent). Approved awards have been fully accrued and recorded as Grant Expenditures (Table 2). The Grants Payable Liability reflects accrued awards less any expenditures (Table 1: Statement of Net Assets) Table 1 Statement of Net Assets As of June 30, 2019 Assets Current Investments $ 15,715,729 Noncurrent Investments 368,278,105 Total Assets $ 383,993,834 Liabilities and Net Assets Liabilities Grants Payable 35,848,905 Total Liabilities $ 35,848,905 Net Assets Temporarily Restricted - Spendable $ 1,968,536 Temporarily Restricted - Endowment 64,348,651 Permanently Restricted - Endowment 281,827,742 Total Net Assets $ 348,144,929 Total Liabilities and Net Assets $ 383,993,834 Table 2 Statement of Revenues, Expenditures, and Changes in Net Assets For the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019 Revenues Gifts Received $ - Interest Income 174,218 Change in Fair Value of Endowed Funds 13,122,033 Total Revenues $ 13,296,251 Expenditures OAC Initiatives Administrative Expenditures $ 379,654 Grant Expenditures 5,286,318 PERC Initiatives Administrative Expenditures 705,071 Grant Expenditures 11,060,797 Total Expenditures $ 17,431,840 Net Increase/(Decrease) in Net Assets $ (4,135,589) Financial Notes Cash and Investments The financial resources that support Wisconsin Partnership Program grants as of June 30, 2019 (Table 1) were generated from funds released by the Wisconsin United for Health Foundation, Inc., as prescribed in the Grant Agreement, as well as generated from investment earnings. All funds are in custody of and managed by the Wisconsin Foundation and Alumni Association (WFAA). As needed, funds are transferred to the SMPH to reimburse expendi tures. Current Investments Current investments consist of participation in the WFAA Callable Pool. The primary investment objective of the Callable Pool is to preserve the capital and provide liquidity when dollars are called. The Callable Pool is invest ed in high -quality, short -term fixed income securities. The Wisconsin Partnership Program Callable Pool investments earn a fixed payout rate. On an annual basis, the WFAA Investment Committee will determine the fixed payout rate for the following fiscal ye ar. Noncurrent Investments Noncurrent investments consist of participation in the WFAA Endowment portfolio. The primary investment objective of the Endowment portfolio is to maximize long -term real returns commensurate with the stated risk tolerance, whi le providing distributions for current spending needs. The Endowment portfolio's asset allocation model is primarily equity oriented and includes public equities, equity -like vehicles such as private equity and real estate, as well as fixed income. The En dowment portfolio's asset allocation model is designed to seek broad exposure to the global capital markets, mindful of the benefits of diversification, to invest within the stated risk -tolerance level, and to promote a cost -conscious investment model whil e investing within portfolio guidelines. The WFAA Investments team has managing fiduciary responsibility and monitors industry trends, explores and evaluates financial opportunities, and works closely with the Investment Committee, whose members have sign ificant experience in the investment field. The committee, guided by established Foundation policy, governs and provides oversight to the investments team. Change in Investment Allocation The Wisconsin Partnership Program has historically maintained fund s that have been distributed from the Endowment and are available for expenditure in the WFAA Callable Pool, as described in the Current Investments section of this report. As of December 31, 2012, the Wisconsin Partnership Program moved $10 million of fun ds from the Callable Pool to the Endowment portfolio as described in the Noncurrent Investments section of this report. The purpose of this move was to achieve a higher rate of return, allowing for increased grant levels. The program made a planned second reinvestment of $10 million in March 2013. These funds remain fully available to the program and are reflected in Net Assets Temporarily Restricted - Spendable. As of June 30, 2019, the balance of these funds is $22.1 million in the Endowment portfolio. Th ere is an additional $17.8 million of funds available in the Callable Pool. Liabilities - Grants Payable Grants payable are recorded as of the date of approval by the Oversight and Advisory Committee or Partnership Education and Research Committee. The l iability reflects the total amount of the grant award, less any payments made on or before June 30, 2019. Any subsequent modifications to grant awards are recorded as adjustments of the grant expenditures in the year the adjustment occurs. Net Assets Based upon the Grant Agreement, net assets are divided into the following three components: Temporarily restricted \u2014Spendable Fund: the portion of net assets relating to funds that have been distributed from the endowment fund, along with related income t hat is available to the program. These funds are available for the program's grants and administrative expenditures. Temporarily Restricted \u2014Endowment Fund: the portion of net assets derived from gains or losses to the permanently restricted funds that hav e not been distributed, and remain within the Endowment portfolio as of June 30, 2019. Permanently Restricted \u2014Endowment Fund: the portion of the gift proceeds initially allocated to permanently endow the Wisconsin Partnership Program. These funds have bee n invested in the Endowment portfolio of the WFAA, and the principal is not available to be spent for Partnership Program purposes. Statement of Revenues, Expenses and Changes in Net Assets Revenues Revenues for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 (Tabl e 2), consist of two components: (1) interest income, which has been recorded as earned throughout the period; and (2) the change in fair value of endowed funds, which represents the increase or decrease in the fair value of funds invested in the WFAA Endo wment Fund. The change in fair value of endowed funds is shown after fees have been deducted (net of fees). The WFAA incurs management fees for both external and internal asset managers, and records its revenues net of these fees. In addition, the WFAA as sesses an Institutional Advancement Fee of 1 percent of endowed funds, to finance its internal operations (includes WFAA operations and advancement functions). The name of this fee was changed in 2015. The fee was previously called the Expense Recapture Fe e. The Institutional Advancement Fees were $3,639,740 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. Revenues are shown after these fees have been deducted. Effective January 1, 2012, the WFAA modified its policy regarding the Investment Recapture Fee, now known as the Institutional Advancement Fee. The Foundation voted to decrease the fee from 1 percent to 0 .7 percent on amounts above $250 million per qualified relationship. Partnership Program funds exceed the newly established level, and the annual fee amo unts in the preceding paragraph reflect this decrease. The Dean of the School of Medicine and Public Health proposed that the savings from this fee reduction would be fully allocated to the Oversight and Advisory Committee for public health initiatives. This proposal was formally accepted by the OAC. These savings were $341,922 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. Endowment fund distributions to the spendable funds are based on the WFAA spending policy, which is applied to the market value of the endowment funds. Expenses Expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 consist of grant awards as described above, and administrative expenditures. All expenditures fall under one of the two major components identified in the Wisconsin Partnership Program's 2014 -2019 Five -Year Plan: public health initiatives (OAC -35 percent) and partnership education and research init iatives (PERC -65 percent). Award amounts reflect the total award amounts made in any year over their complete duration. For example, an award of $100,000 per year with a term of three years will be recorded as a $300,000 award in the year it is made. OAC and PERC awards do not all have the same durations, nor are they on the same renewal timeframes. As such, the total awards in any given year will not necessarily equal the 35/65 ratio of funds between OAC and PERC. Over time, however, awards and actual exp enditures will mirror the allocation percentages. Detailed information on OAC award amounts is shown in Tables 4 and 5, while PERC award amounts are in Tables 6 and 7. Administrative expenses include costs incurred by the Wisconsin Partnership Program in seeking and reviewing applications, monitoring and evaluating awards, and supporting other key components of compliance and infrastructure to maintain its grantmaking activities. They do not include WFAA expenses. The UW School of Medicine and Public Healt h also provides in -kind support. The Wisconsin Partnership Program's Oversight and Advisory Committee and Partnership Education and Research Committee annually approve the administrative budget.
