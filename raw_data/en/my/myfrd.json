The PhD-QBM-BHDS programme is for students who have an undergraduate or a master's degree in a quantitative discipline such as statistics, data science, engineering, demography and epidemiology. Students in our programme will develop innovative statistical and data science solutions and apply them to solve real-life problems in health and biomedical sciences. Major methodological research areas include: - Artificial intelligence and machine learning - Design and analysis of clinical trials, including adaptive and cluster trials - Dynamic treatment regime - Diagnostic medicine - High dimensional \"omics\" data - Pleiotropy studies - Recurrent events in cohort and case-control studies - Time-to-event analysis - Quantification of quality of life and subjective health outcomes Major application areas include: - Big data analytics in healthcare - Clinical trials in chronic diseases - Emergency medicine - Genetic epidemiology - Quality of life in chronic diseases and palliative care - Medical devices - Vaccines and infectious diseases PhD scholarship PhD students will receive: - A scholarship covering 100% of tuition and fees. - A monthly stipend. - There is no service obligation (no bond) Curriculum The degree will take on average 4 to 5 years to complete. In years 1 and 2, students will complete a core set of study modules, an elective module, and a biomedical research internship. In year 2, students will also work towards developing their thesis projects and take a qualifying examination, which includes submission and defence of a research proposal. The remainder of the PhD training consists of the execution of the thesis project, culminating with the development of a written thesis and a successful oral dissertation defence. In addition, students will participate in a journal club in the first semester of every year. | | Curriculum Requirement | | Credit | | GMS6801 - Study Designs in Clinical and Population Health Research | | 4 | | GMS6802 - Core Concepts in Biostatistics | | 4 | | GMS6821 - R-Programming | | Non-credit | | GMS6850 - Core Concepts in Bioinformatics | | 4 | | GMS6802 - Analysis of Complex Biomedical Data | | 4 | | GMS6804 - Biomedical Research Internship | | 4 | | Elective module, course code 5000 level or higher | | 4 | | GMS6800 - Integrated Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Journal Club | | 1\u00d74 | | Thesis Research | | 32 | | Total | | 60 Contact If you are interested in the PhD Programme in Quantitative Biology and Medicine (QBM), please contact "}
