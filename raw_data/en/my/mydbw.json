The greatest reward from these achievements is the realization that patients' lives are improved and enriched because of the outstanding research carried out by Beaumont physicians, scientists and staff. Outstanding biomedical research is a major component of the excellent reputation of Beaumont Health as an academic health system. The Board of Directors at Beaumont made a commitment several decades ago to strengthen Beaumont as an academic institution through growth and support of graduate medical education, the hiring of full time physicians with a history of excellence in research, and committed support of ongoing research activities of key programs. This commitment has helped to forge the reputation of Beaumont Health as a leading academic health system, with recognition by U.S. News and World Report, a distinction which places Beaumont in the forefront of medicine in the U.S. As Beaumont Health moves forward as the health care affiliate with the Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine, our research activities, graduate medical education, and scholarly endeavors are even more important. Our Board of Directors and senior leadership have reaffirmed their commitment to this ongoing academic mission for Beaumont. Strong undergraduate medical education requires faculty committed to research and a broad, excellent program of graduate medical education. The ACGME (Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education) is steadily increasing the requirements for excellence in both faculty research achievement and resident/fellow research training in order to maintain full accreditation for residency and fellowship programs. The Board for Accrediting Level 1 Trauma Center status, presently achieved by Beaumont Royal Oak, now requires productivity of peer-reviewed publications in recognized journals by participating faculty. The LCME (Liaison Committee on Medical Education), the accrediting organization for medical schools in the U.S. and Canada, requires the presence of biomedical research activities that can provide basic, translational and population research opportunities for medical students. The OUWB medical school provides further impetus to enhance biomedical research at both Beaumont and Oakland University, to integrate research activities between the two institutions, and to initiate new programs, centers, and collaborative projects shared by both institutions. Beaumont and Oakland University already have several areas of long standing ongoing research collaboration. Beaumont research is heavily oriented towards translational research, investigating new treatments, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and scientific approaches aimed at enhancing the excellence and safety of patient care. Beaumont has a robust program of clinical research, numbering over 1,158 trials with over 10,363 registered research participants. Beaumont's clinical services are superb, providing the standard upon which new and innovative research is built. The volume of patients served at Beaumont, combined with the excellence of clinical care, provides a striking opportunity to develop new treatments. Moving forward, Beaumont Health and OUWB will build upon existing research strengths in nationally recognized clinical and translational programs, including Cardiovascular Medicine, Radiation Oncology, Urology, Orthopaedics, OB/GYN, Ophthalmology, Emergency Medicine and many others, to establish a new emphasis in population/community health and learning health system initiatives that will focus on improving health and healthcare delivery for our patients and communities. We are proud to present this Report of Research Accomplishments. It highlights the depth and breadth of Beaumont's academic excellence, including our affiliation with OUWB. We extend our congratulations and appreciation to the many investigators who have contributed these extraordinary achievements.Beaumont Health, serving southern Michigan and beyond, recognizes the inherent value of research as a major contributing factor to future improvements in health care delivery and the health of our local and global communities. The Beaumont Research Institute (RI), established by the Board of Trustees in 1966, strengthens Beaumont's ability to conduct medical research and to provide research training for allied health and medical staff and participants in undergraduate and graduate medical education programs. Beaumont Health is a major teaching facility, with 84 accredited residency and fellowship programs involving 835 residents and 96 fellows, and 160 research staff.
