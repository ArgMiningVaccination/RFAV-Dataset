More than a mere system of treating illness, Ayurveda is a science of life (Ayur = life, Veda = science or knowledge). It offers a body of wisdom designed to help people stay vibrant and healthy while realizing their full human potential. Ayurveda is a personalized approach to health, and knowing your mind-body type (dosha) allows you to make optimal choices about diet, exercise, supplements, and all other aspects of your lifestyle. You can learn more about Ayurvedic mind-body types (dosha) and find out how to identify your own individual type. Being aware of your dosha( body type) will allow you to identify Ayurvedic protocols to align your internal nature (our circadian rhythms) with the larger cycles of nature, such as the daily rhythms and seasonal cycles. It's like having a roadmap that leads you closer to your best self, so that you can reach your true potential, and be more radiant and joyful. In Ayurvedic medicine, optimal health and even one's spiritual growth starts with prevention. Prevention is based on a balanced lifestyle that is in harmony with the cycles of nature. Ayurveda recognizes that all living creatures, whether human, plant or animal, must live in harmony with nature in order to survive. Like the owner's manual of your car prescribes maintenance schedules for the long-term health of your car, Ayurveda speaks of daily and seasonal routines that ensure maximal health, mental clarity, and longevity. Ayurveda believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe: - space, air, fire, water, and earth. - These combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas. - They control how your body works. They are Vata dosha (space and air); Pitta dosha (fire and water); and Kaphadosha (water and earth). - Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas. But one is usually stronger than the others. Each one controls a different body function. It's believed that your chances of getting sick -- and the health issues you develop -- are linked to the balance of your doshas. Ayurveda believe this is the most powerful of all three doshas. It controls very basic body functions, like how cells divide. It also controls your mind, breathing, blood flow, heart function, and ability to get rid of waste through your intestines. Things that can disrupt it include eating again too soon after a meal, fear, grief, and staying up too late. If vata dosha is out of balance, you're more likely to develop conditions like anxiety, constipation, gases, and dry skin. This energy controls your digestion, metabolism (how well you break down foods), and certain hormones that are linked to your appetite. Things that can disrupt it are eating sour or spicy foods and spending too much time in the sun. If pitta is out of balance, you're more likely to develop conditions like inflammation and infections. Burning indigestion, and anger This life force controls muscle growth, body strength and stability, weight, and your immune system. You can disrupt it by sleeping during the day, eating too many sweet foods, and eating or drinking things that contain too much salt or water. If kaphais out of balance, you may develop breathing disorders, diabetes, nauseaafter eating, obesity, and depression. Take a \"just-for-me\" break right now, right here. Disconnect from the outer world and tune in to your own self. Even if you do this for a minute, you will feel healed. Pick the flavor and blend that suits yourdosha type.caffeine-free teas prepared from nature's healing herbs are a perfect way to relax and recharge Water flushes out accumulated toxins, and keeps the digestion smooth. Sipped throughout the day, water is an excellent healer. At the end of a tiring day, when you cannot seem to close your eyes,. Milk should be organic and free of additives, and boiled with a pinch of cardamom before it is drunk in order to make it easier to digest. Drink it alone, away from meals, to avoid indigestion. It balances all three doshas without putting excessive strain on your body. It calms the mind and nourishes the senses. Just for today, make the effort to eat a fresh, warm lunch. Eat in a settled, quiet atmosphere and focus on your food when you eat. Ayurvedic physicians emphasize the value of good sleep, simply because rest is the basis of dynamic activity. At any given time, most of us do have small or big imbalances in our physiology. Even small imbalances can lead to discomfort and malaise. An ayurvedic specialist will help you understand and correct your imbalances. See one even if you are not feeling particularly unwell. "}
