During this time, I've seen a dramatic and encouraging shift in thepublic's perception of nutrition. People are taking more personal responsibility for theirhealth and the health of their children. Parents are becoming increasingly proactiveabout safeguarding their children's health. They are questioning the overuse of medica-tion and searching for safer, effective, natural alternatives. They're beginning to under-stand that healthy foods, nutrients, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, amino acids,essential fatty acids, herbs, and nutraceuticals play a huge role in maintaining their chil-dren's health and supporting their ability to heal. Now the bad news\u2014I've also seen an alarming increase in the rate of many serious health conditions, such as autism, Attention Decit Disorder (ADD), AttentionDecit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), learning disabilities, asthma, food allergies,and obesity in our children. T wenty-ve years ago, autism was rare; now 1 in 150 chil-dren are diagnosed with the disorder. ADD and ADHD are sweeping the country, withmore than 2 million children diagnosed. Between 5 and 10 percent of schoolchildrenare diagnosed with learning disabilities. Asthma is reaching epidemic proportions, af-fecting more than 6 percent of kids in the United States. More than 12 million childrenand adults suffer from food allergies, and the numbers continue to rise. I was particularly moved by the rising rate of autism in our kids, and about fteen years ago, I began to focus my practice on treating kids with the condition, as well asrelated disorders such as Asperger's Syndrome, Pervasive Developmental Disorder-NotOtherwise Specied (PDD-NOS), ADD, and ADHD. First identied in 1943 by Dr.Leo Kanner of Johns Hopkins University, autism remains the most puzzling childhooddisorder. To this day, no one knows what causes autism, how best to treat it, and whysome kids recover while others do not. This means that treating autism is literally likeputting together the pieces of a puzzle. There is no \"cookie cutter\" approach. Everychild is unique and responds to a different variety of treatment approaches. Therefore0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page ixit's critical that you work together with your child's medical team to create the most ef- fective combination of therapies for your child. T reatment of autism typically includes medication, special education services, behav- ioral programs, occupational therapy, sensory integration therapy, speech-languagetherapy, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), biomedical treatment, andnumerous other therapies such as art, music, and hippotherapy . However, too often there's one critical element missing\u2014nutrition therapy. The right nutritional interventions can have a huge impact on your child's brain function, memory, learning, attention, focus, mood, behavior, growth, and overallhealth. Nutrition can protect your child's body from neurotoxins, enhance his immunesystem, and support his gastrointestinal function. Unfortunately, many physicians andother healthcare professionals don't recognize the importance of nutrition therapy intreating autism and even discourage parents from pursuing nutritional interventions. Ibelieve this happens in large part because of the false claims that have been made that aspecial diet or nutritional supplement can \"cure\" autism or create \"miraculous recover-ies.\" I also think part of the problem lies in the massive amount of controversial andquestionable information about nutritional interventions used to treat autism found onthe Internet. Sadly, there are many unqualied people out there claiming to be nutri-tionists who provide parents with misinformation, false claims, and testimonials andsell them all kinds of ineffective and costly nutritional supplements. The truth is, no diet or supplement will miraculously cure autism. However, you can use food, supplements, herbs, and nutraceuticals to feed your autistic child's starvingbrain and body and maximize his brain function, which will make him more respon-sive to other treatments and therapies. Nutrition is the basis upon which all other treat-ments are built, and nutrition therapy should be a part of every autistic child'scomprehensive treatment plan. I wrote this book because I want to help both parents and professionals better un- derstand the role of nutrition therapy in treating autism, Asperger's, PDD-NOS,ADD, and ADHD. Unlike other books on these conditions, which dedicate at best onechapter to nutritional interventions, Eating for Autism is focused solely on nutrition.I've spent many years treating hundreds of children with these conditions, and I'vegained a very clear understanding of parents' concerns, questions, and specic needs forhelp regarding nutrition. Eating for Autism is specically designed for: Parents who are seeking guidance in making informed decisions about safe and ef- fective nutritional interventions for their children. It's my hope that this book will helpyou separate fact from ction with regard to the information on nutritional interven-tions found on the Internet and suggested by some practitioners. I encourage you tox PREFACE0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page xuse this book when discussing nutritional interventions with your child's physician, di- etitian, educators, and other healthcare professionals. Registered dietitians who are seeking to enhance their clinical skills in providing nutrition therapy to children with autism. There's new and controversial informationabout nutrition interventions constantly emerging in the autism community. Dietitiansare obligated to research and evaluate new proposed nutritional interventions and pro-vide families with reliable information so they can make safe, responsible decisions re-garding diets, supplements, and nutrition therapy for their children. Physicians who would like to know more about the critical role nutrition therapy plays in the comprehensive treatment of autism. When physicians emphasize the rolethat nutrition plays in enhancing a child's brain and body function, it encourages par-ents to take good nutrition more seriously. Physicians can also refer parents to a regis-tered dietitian who specializes in developmental disabilities. Educators who are seeking a broader understanding of how nutrition impacts chil- dren's cognitive function and their ability to learn in the classroom. It's critical for edu-cators to understand how certain foods, food additives, and nutrient decienciescontribute to behavioral problems, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and poor classroomperformance. Nutritional interventions can help children with autism benet fromtheir special education services and should be considered in the educational system. Other healthcare professionals who want to understand why nutrition therapy is an important component to treating autism. If an autistic child is nutritionally com-promised, it will negatively impact his ability to respond to other treatment ap-proaches, such as behavioral programs and art, music, hippo-, occupational, sensoryintegration, and speech-language therapies. All therapists involved in treating autismshould advocate for the inclusion of nutrition therapy, so these children are better ableto benet from their treatment approaches. Eating for Autism will give you the tools you need to make nutrition therapy an ef- fective part of your child's autism treatment and improve both his functioning and hiswell-being.

Thank you! xii0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page xiiINTRODUCTION Understanding the Autism-Nutrition Connection Most people, including healthcare professionals, don't put much thought into food or nutrition. When they think about food, it's usually about how it tastes, looks, smells, orfeels in their mouths. Typically the focus of family gatherings, holidays, and parties,food gives us a reason to get together and socialize. We don't often stop to considerwhat it actually does in our bodies. But when you have a child with autism or a relateddisorder, it's critical to understand that food is more than just something that brings uspleasure. What your child eats can have a major positive or negative impact on hisbrain and bodily functions. Therefore, it's important for you to know exactly how foodimpacts your child. Both you and your child's healthcare team need to recognize thatwithout proper nutrition, your child will not function at his full potential and will notfully benet from his therapy sessions. Following are just a few examples how a poordiet can negatively affect your child: Brain development and function. Your child's brain is highly dependent on the vita- mins, minerals, amino acids, essential fatty acids, and calories found in food. For in-stance, if your child is not getting enough of certain key nutrients, it compromises hisneurotransmitter production, the synthesis of his brain's myelin sheath, glucose oxi- dation , and his visual and cognitive processing. If he's consuming too much sugar and articial additives, it can compromise his brain function and contribute to behaviorand learning problems. Detoxification processes. Your child must consume zinc, selenium, magnesium, beta carotene, vitamin A, vitamin E, and choline to help his liver naturally rid his body ofharmful neurotoxins like mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium, dioxins, PCBs, pesticides,and solvents. Exposure to these neurotoxins can damage your child's brain and central 10738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 1nervous system, which in turn could cause him to have a lower IQ, learning disabili- ties, attention decit, hyperactivity, impulsivity, compulsive behavior, aggression, vio-lence, speech difculties, memory impairment, motor dysfunction, developmental delays, and mental retardation. Gastrointestinal (GI) health. The GI tract is highly dependent on the amino acid glut- amine and requires a constant supply of vitamins and minerals for normal bowel func-tion. If your child has nutritional deciencies, it can impair new cellular growth in hisgastrointestinal tract, which in turn compromises his ability to absorb the nutrients heconsumes in foods. When this occurs, it makes other nutritional deciencies that im-pact the brain and body even worse. Immune system function. Our immune system relies on vitamin C, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin D, B vitamins, iron, selenium, zinc, and bioflavonoids to function at its op-timum level. A poor diet puts your child at greater risk for developing allergies as wellas frequent ear infections, acute and chronic illnesses, and upper respiratory infections.If your child is continually ghting off illness, he will inevitably miss school and ther-apy sessions, which will further compromise his response to treatment. Erythropoiesis. Erythropoiesis is the process by which red blood cells are produced, usually in the bone marrow. Red blood cells are the vehicles that transport oxygen toour brains and throughout our bodies. Key nutrients that support this process includeiron, vitamin B 6, copper, folate, vitamin B12, vitamin C, and vitamin E. Dietary de- ciencies in these nutrients can cause anemia, which can lead to irritability, headaches,loss of appetite, lethargy, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, and poor school performance. Nutritional Problems are Common with Autism. A large percentage of children with autism, Asperger's, PDD-NOS, ADD, and ADHD struggle with one or more of thefollowing nutritional problems:2 EATING FOR AUTISM \u0081 poor diet\u0081 and drug and nutrient interactions0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 2Children with autism also often have dysfunctional immune systems and inade- quate detoxification processes. These nutritional problems place a huge burden on your child and are slowly eating away at his health and ability to function to hishighest potential. In fact, I'm amazed that many kids with autism and nutritionalproblems are able to function at all, much less go to school, sit still, focus, processinformation, learn, and participate in therapy sessions. Eating for Autism will show you how to relieve your child of these nutritional burdens. You'll see that as each ofyour child's nutritional problems is treated and resolved, his health and behaviorwill improve. Your child will function better and respond better to all facets of histreatment. NUTRITIONAL INTERVENTIONS USED TO TREAT AUTISM If you've already begun investigating nutritional interventions as a way to help treat yourchild's autism, you probably know that there are many different ones out there, such asrestrictive diets, high-dose vitamins, supplements, and more. What you may not know isthat specic nutritional interventions are usually designed to target specic issues a childmay have, such as improving cognitive functioning, or treating physical problems likefood allergies, GI disorders, and immune and detoxication system dysfunction. Here'sa list of the most common nutrition interventions used in the autism community: fatty x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 3Many of these nutritional interventions are controversial, and the medical commu- nity doesn't encourage parents to try them because there's little science-based research available on them. In fact, most of the current research on nutritional interventions totreat autism is anecdotal, which means it's based on nonscientic observations or stud-ies. In the medical world, only double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinicaltrials can prove the effectiveness of a proposed nutrition theory (i.e., Can a gluten-free,casein-free diet improve autistic symptoms?). There are several reasons for this lack ofscientic evidence in the area of nutritional interventions: Scientific studies are extremely difficult to perform. Getting approval for and per- forming human studies, especially on children with developmental disabilities, is ahuge challenge. A scientic study on the effectiveness of a gluten-free, casein-free diet,for example, would require gathering together a group of hundreds of children diag-nosed with autism and making sure all of their treatment approaches remained consis-tent while changing just one variable\u2014their diet. The study would need to beconducted blindly, without the children, parents, therapists, and investigators knowingwhich group of children in the study are on the diet and which are not. The complexityof conducting this kind of scientic-based research study is prohibitive, so anecdotal-based research is conducted instead. Research in the area of autism is fairly new. It was only in December 2006 that the U.S. government nally recognized autism as a national problem and authorized $1 billion of federal funding for autism-related research. However, conducting science-based research studies takes time. It could take another ten or even twenty years for themedical community to agree on the interpretation of the results of these studies and4 EATING FOR AUTISM 12Nutrients, Herbs, and Nutraceuticals0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 4 apply them in the real world of treating children with autism. If you have a child diag- nosed with autism today, that's simply too long for you to wait. Funding is scarce. Lack of private and federal funding is the primary reason why so few science-based research studies have been conducted on nutritional interventions.Of the $1 billion the federal government has made available for autism research, noneof it is designated for nutritional interventions research. As long as funding for researchon nutritional interventions remains scarce, lack of scientic evidence will continue tobe an issue. It's important to remember that just because most of the research on nutritional in- terventions is anecdotal instead of scientic, that doesn't mean that they don't work orshouldn't be considered when creating a treatment plan for autism. Hopefully, ade-quate funding will become available in the near future that will enable us to conductscience-based research on nutritional interventions that anecdotal evidence suggests iseffective in reducing the symptoms of autism. This will help cement nutrition therapy'splace as part of mainstream autism treatment. HOW THIS BOOK CAN HELP YOU Even the most well-read, technologically savvy parent can become confused and over-whelmed when it comes to nutrition therapy. There's so much information out thereon the Internet, passed along in parent support groups and the media, from both med-ical and non-medical sources\u2014it's difcult to sift through it all. It's next to impossiblefor parents to analyze the scientic and anecdotal evidence, consider restrictive dietsand high-dose vitamins, select an appropriate vitamin/mineral supplement, decidewhich nutrients, herbs, and nutraceuticals are right for their children, and implementall these nutritional interventions safely without professional help. Even with profes- sional help, many parents get so overwhelmed, frustrated, and discouraged that theydecide to give up. Over the last several years, I've developed a ten-step approach to integrating nutri- tional interventions into treatment plans for children with autism and related disor-ders. Eating for Autism will guide you step-by-step through the process, starting with basic nutritional interventions and gradually moving to more advanced levels of nutri-tion therapy. My approach is family-friendly and easy to implement, and it allows youto move through each step at your own pace and level of comfort. This book is designed to be used to suit each reader's individual needs. For instance, you may see a signicant improvement in your child after implementing just the basic5 INTRODUCTION: UNDERSTANDING THE AUTISM-NUTRITION CONNECTION0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 5steps and choose to stop at that point. Or, after mastering the basic steps, you may choose to implement only a few of the advanced steps. Many parents choose to imple-ment every step in the program. (It's important to note that each step builds on the pre-vious one and gets more advanced as the book progresses, so you need to implementthem in the order I've provided.) Whether you're just interested in the basic steps orwant to apply more advance interventions, you are sure to see positive improvements inyour child's condition, from his behavior, mood, sleeping patterns, and overall healthto his response to other treatment approaches.6 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM 6PART I: PLAN0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 2:26 PM Page 70738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 8 This page intentionally left blank STEP 1 Transition Your Child to a Healthy Diet One of the biggest mistakes I see parents make when it comes to incorporating nutri- tion therapy into their children's treatment program is jumping into advanced inter-ventions instead of starting with the basics. In nutrition therapy, each step builds uponthe previous one, becoming more advanced as you work your way through the pro-gram. The rst thing you need to do is identify and resolve any basic nutrition issuesyour child may have. He won't be able to properly respond to or benet from advancednutrition interventions if basic nutrition is still a problem. Basic nutrition has become a serious issue for our children over the last twenty years because it has changed so dramatically. The food children eat today is nothing like thefood children ate in previous generations. Today, children subsist mainly on foods thatare highly processed, lacking in nutrients, and loaded with articial chemicals, preserv-atives, trans fats, excess sugar, and pesticide residues. Take a look at the ingredients liston some of the packaged foods you have in your refrigerator or pantry. I'll bet the list isa mile long, and you can't even pronounce most of the ingredients, much less knowwhat they are. The repercussions of this shift away from poor nutrition are serious.We've seen a dramatic increase in developmental and neurological disorders in our chil-dren. Therefore, step one is to transition your child onto a diet that consists of whole,healthy foods and eliminate all unnecessary articial ingredients. ELIMINATE SYNTHETIC FOOD ADDITIVES There are twenty-four different types of synthetic food additives found in the foods weeat. Before a food additive is added to our foods, it must be deemed \"generally recog- nized as safe\" (GRAS) and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that it's been proven safe for the general public and poses no signicant 90738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 9health hazard, such as promoting cancer. But the reality is that we are consuming human-made chemicals with virtually every bite of food, and no one really knows whateffect they may be having on our immune, respiratory, endocrine, and nervous systems.There's a lot of controversy in the medical community about what the short- and long-term impact of these chemicals may be on a growing child's brain and nervous system.The autism community is particularly concerned about four of the synthetic food addi-tives: articial colors, articial flavors, preservatives, and articial sweeteners. Here is a list of the twenty-four types of food additives found in the foods we eat:10 EATING FOR AUTISM are seven articial colors currently permitted in our foods in the United States: Blue No. 1, Blue No. 2, Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Red No. 3, Yellow No. 5, and Yel-low No. 6. There's a growing body of research that indicates some children are sensitiveto these articial colors and that they aggravate their ADD and ADHD symptoms.Most recently, a study published in the November 2007 issue of The Lancet concluded that articial colors in the diets of children resulted in increased hyperactivity. Researchalso indicates that ingesting articial colors may result in behavioral changes such as ir-ritability, restlessness, and sleep disturbance. Other research indicates that when in-gested, some articial colors may aggravate the symptoms of hives, eczema, dermatitis,rhinitis, and asthma. There's an additional issue that many parents are not aware of\u2014most articial colors are made from a mixture of phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydro-carbons, and heterocyclic compounds called coal tar . Coal tar is the by-product of coal when it's carbonized to make coke (a fuel) or gasied to make coal gas. Coal tar is alsofound in medicated shampoo, soap, and ointments, and is used as a treatment to killhead lice. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, any productwith a certain percentage of crude coal tar is considered a Group 1 carcinogen. Clearly,0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 10too much coal tar is a bad thing. Given all of the possible adverse effects articial colors can have on your child, I strongly encourage you to remove them from his diet. Thisstep will denitely help relieve your child's physical and behavioral symptoms, thoughthe degree to which it will help will depend on the level of his sensitivity to chemicals. Artificial Flavors Articial flavors are chemically synthesized compounds added to foods to either imitateor enhance a natural flavor. There are approximately seventeen hundred articial flavorsapproved by the FDA. An articial flavor of particular concern in the autism commu-nity is monosodium glutamate (MSG). MSG is the sodium salt of an amino acidcalled glutamic acid and the ionized form of glutamate. It's used commercially as a fla-vor enhancer and found in many common food products such as canned soups, beefand chicken stocks, flavored potato chips, snack foods, frozen dinners, instant mealswith seasoning mixtures, and foods from fast-food restaurants. Some fermented prod-ucts have naturally occurring glutamate, such as soy sauce, steak sauce, and Worcester-shire sauce. Glutamate may also be present in a variety of other additives, such ashydrolyzed vegetable protein, hydrolyzed soy protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extract, soy extracts, and protein isolate. MSG isn't always easy to spot on a food label. Be on the lookout for the terms \"spices\" and \"natural flavorings\" on a food label. They indicate that it may containMSG. The food additives \"disodium inosinate\" and \"disodium guanylate\" are usedonly with MSG, so if these additives are on a food label, there's a good chance thatMSG is also in the food product. MSG is \"generally recognized as safe\" by the FDA; however, there arehealth cerns. Glutamic acid is classied as an excitotoxin , and animal studies indicate that in- gesting a high level of it causes brain damage. While most researchers agree it's unlikelythat human adults could ingest enough MSG to create glutamic acid levels high enoughto promote neurological damage, there is concern about the unknown long-term neu-rodegenerative effects of small to moderate rises of glutamic acid in our systems overtime. Researchers are also concerned about the potential short- and long-term effectsMSG may have on infants and young children. There appears to be a number of peoplewho are sensitive to MSG and develop acute adverse reactions such as headache, facialpressure, chest pain, nausea, difculty breathing, drowsiness, weakness, and aggravationof asthma symptoms. What if, for example, you have an autistic child who is nonverbalwith severe behavioral problems and is sensitive to an articial flavor like MSG? If heconsumes it in his diet on a regular basis and develops a severe headache every day, howis he going to tell you? Since he's nonverbal, he'll communicate to you through his11 STEP 1: TRANSITION YOUR CHILD TO A HEALTHY DIET0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 11 behavior\u2014he may slap himself in the head, head bang, self abuse, become irritable, un- cooperative, or have tantrums. Sensitivity to one or more articial flavors may be caus-ing or exacerbating a physical problem for your child, which in turn may be causing abehavioral problem. Removing articial flavors from his diet is a critical step toward im-proving his symptoms. Artificial Preservatives A preservative is a natural or human-made chemical that is added to food products toinhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi, inhibit oxidation, and prevent changes in thefood's color, odor, and taste. Natural preservatives include salt, sugar, and vinegar, andthe processes of freezing, pickling, smoking, and salting are also used to preserve foodsnaturally. Articial preservatives are controversial because research has shown thatsome of them cause various health problems, respiratory problems, and cancer. Re-search also shows that articial preservatives aggravate ADD and ADHD symptoms insome children. Articial preservatives do affect your child. A research study conducted in New York City Public Schools showed that when articial additives, including preservatives, wereeliminated from the school food program, the students' academic performance in-creased and disciplinary problems decreased. The autism community is particularly concerned about the effect that the artificial preservatives butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) children. BHT and BHA are fat-soluble phenol compounds ap- proved by the FDA to be used as an antioxidant food additive. They're also used inpharmaceuticals, cosmetics, jet fuels, rubber, petroleum products, and embalmingfluid. Research indicates that BHT, which can be found in cereal, chewing gum, andhigh-fat foods such as potato chips and shortening, promotes certain forms of cancerand tumors. Many countries, such as Japan, Romania, Sweden, and Australia havebanned BHT from use in foods, but the United States has not yet followed suit.However, the United States has barred it from being used in baby foods. Many foodindustries have voluntarily eliminated BHT from their foods and replaced it with thepreservative BHA, but there are also serious concerns about BHA. After conductinganimal studies, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded that it's reason-able to assume that BHA is a human carcinogen (cancer forming). Researchers alsosuspect that people with dysfunctional detoxification systems (or whose bodies havetrouble eliminating toxins from their system) may have difficulty processing bothBHT and BHA. In children with autism, this is expressed as behavioral problems.(T urn to Step 10 for more about the problems a dysfunctional detoxification system12 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 12can cause for children and why they are more vulnerable to adverse reactions to arti- ficial colors, flavors, and preservatives.) Eliminating artificial preservatives, especiallyBHT and BHA, from your child's diet should help relieve some of his behavioralsymptoms. Artificial Sweeteners Articial sweeteners are human-made compounds that are many times sweeter than su-crose , or table sugar. Their safety and potential for health risks, including cancer, has been a longstanding controversy in the medical community. The three most commonlyused articial sweeteners in the United States are saccharin (Sweet'N Low), sucralose (Splenda), and aspartame (NutraSweet and Equal). Saccharin, the rst articial sweet- ener created, is three hundred to ve hundred times sweeter than table sugar. Saccharinis FDA-approved in the United States, but some countries allow only a restricted levelof use, and other countries have banned it completely. Sucralose is a chlorinated sugar that is six hundred times sweeter than table sugar. It belongs to a class of chemicals called organochlorides , some of which are highly toxic or carcinogenic. However, many researchers suggest that since sucralose is insoluble infat, it doesn't accumulate in fat as do other organochlorides, which reduces its risk oftoxicity. The articial sweetener aspartame is derived from two amino acids, aspartic acid and phenylalanine, and is two hundred times sweeter than table sugar. While animal research indicates that aspartame may cause brain cancer in rats, other research showsthat it doesn't cause cancer in humans. However, headaches and seizures have been re-ported in relation to aspartame, making its safety a much-debated topic. In the autismcommunity, the focus is on the impact aspartame may have on a child's brain function.Normally, food contains a variety of amino acids, so after your child consumes a food,his brain receives a balanced combination of several amino acids. But when he drinksan aspartame-sweetened drink, which is heavily concentrated with only two aminoacids, his brain receives a sudden dose of only two amino acids. This unnatural influxdisrupts the sensitive balance among neurotransmitters in the brain and may result inneurological problems. Many believe that when children with autism experience thisneurotransmitter imbalance, it results in mood and behavioral problems that aggravatetheir current behavioral symptoms. Until recently, the food industry had been using corn syrup as a low-cost alternative to sugar in products that traditionally contain sugar. Now, articial sweeteners are be-ing used to replace both sugar and corn syrup, making it the more cost effective choice for food manufacturers.13 STEP 1: TRANSITION YOUR CHILD TO A HEALTHY DIET0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 13Though all of these articial sweeteners are approved for use by the FDA, there's still much debate surrounding their long-term safety, especially for children who could po- tentially have decades of continued exposure. It's important to understand that just be-cause a food additive has been approved by the FDA as GRAS, this doesn't necessarilymean it's safe for our children. Aspartame is a perfect example of this fact. I urge you tobe cautious and eliminate all articial sweeteners from your child's diet. Jason ate a pretty good variety of foods, but I knew they were all unhealthy and lack- ing in nutrition. Honestly, his diet wasn't a priority for me at that time because I was so overwhelmed dealing with his diagnosis and behavioral problems and try-ing to nd therapies to help him. After attending Elizabeth's seminar on nutrition andautism, I had a much better understanding of how Jason's diet and the articialchemicals in the foods he ate could affect his brain, behavior, and ability to functionnormally. I started gradually replacing the foods he ate with foods free of articialcolors, flavors, and excess sugar. I purchased fewer prepackaged foods and startedcooking more meals from scratch using \"real\" food. Just making these few changes in Jason's diet made a big difference. He became less aggressive, stopped hittingand kicking me, and became a calmer, more pleasant child. \u2014Mother of Jason, a seven-year-old with ADHD LIMIT FOODS THAT CONTAIN TRANS FAT T rans fat is the product of hydrogenation , which is the process by which hydrogen is added to liquid vegetable oil. The fatty acids in the oil then acquire some of the hydro- gen, which makes it denser. Typically, the hydrogenation process is only partially com-pleted in order to produce a more malleable fat that is solid at room temperature butwill melt upon baking. Partially hydrogenated fats have replaced natural solid fats and natural liquid oils in our foods because they're cheaper to use than the real thing, andthey prolong the shelf life and flavor stability of foods. When you start reading food la-bels, you may be astonished by the number of products that contain partially hydro-genated oils and therefore trans fat. T rans fat can be found in vegetable shortenings,some margarines, crackers, cookies, chips, cakes, pies, bread, snack foods, and foodsfried in partially hydrogenated oils. It's also used in some dietary supplements, energybars, and nutrition bars. In January 2006, the FDA required food manufacturers to list14 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 14trans fat on their product labels. Dietary supplement manufacturers are also required to list trans fat on the product label if it contains more than 0.5 grams. Many people don't know that trans fat also occurs naturally in the milk and body fat of certain animals, such as cows and sheep. According to the U.S. National DairyCouncil, these natural trans fats found in animal foods don't appear to have the samenegative effects as human-made hydrogenated oils. There are a number of reasons why we should all stay away from trans fats. They raise our LDL (bad cholesterol) and lower our HDL (good cholesterol), which in-creases our risk of coronary heart disease. There's also growing concern that trans fatsmay increase our risk for cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and infertility. But the autismcommunity is especially interested in the negative impact trans fat has on the liver.T rans fats interfere with the enzyme delta 6 desaturase , which is critical in the process of converting essential fatty acids (also known as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids) found in foods to the active forms (arachidonic acid [ARA], eicosapentaenoic acid[EPA], and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) used by the brain. A deciency of delta 6 de-saturase causes a deciency of ARA, EPA, and DHA, which are critical for brain devel-opment, brain function, brain cell signaling, and vision processing. Research indicatesthat children diagnosed with ADD, ADHD, dyslexia, dyspraxia, and autism may al-ready have low levels of delta 6 desaturase, so when these children consume foods withtrans fat, it makes their situations worse. (T urn to Step 4 for more information on howa delta 6 desaturase deciency can affect your child.) I strongly encourage you to keepthe trans fat in your child's diet to a minimum. You can nd omega-3 fatty acids in sh, flaxseed oil, canola oil, walnuts, and pump- kin seeds. Omega-6 fatty acids can be found in soy oil, corn oil, safflower oil, eveningprimrose oil, borage oil, and black currant seed oil. STAY AWAY FROM HIGHLY PROCESSED FOODS Most families live a pretty fast-paced lifestyle these days, and nding time to preparehome-cooked meals made with fresh whole foods can be difcult. Instead, more andmore families depend on the convenience of pre-packaged foods and fast foods. Unfortu-nately, we're paying a very high price for the sake of convenience. A generation ago, a\"processed\" meal simply meant cleaning fresh foods and basic kitchen preparation. Backthen, foods contained a higher percentage of their original vitamins, minerals, phytonu-trients, and ber. The highly processed foods we depend on today have a lower nutri-tional value; are higher in fat, salt, and sugar; and contain trans fat and many food15 STEP 1: TRANSITION YOUR CHILD TO A HEALTHY DIET0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 15additives that may contribute to behavioral and health problems. Sit-down family meals prepared from scratch have become virtually obsolete. I believe that the best way to limitthese unhealthy, processed foods from your child's diet (and your entire family's diet) is tomake family meals a priority in your home. Here's some advice to help make this happen: \u0081 Buy one or two cookbooks with recipes to prepare healthy meals in thirty minutes or less so making meals from scratch is easier to t into your schedule. \u0081 Every weekend, plan your meals for the upcoming week and check to make sure you have the ingredients you need on hand. \u0081 When you cook a meal, make the most of your time by preparing enough food for leftovers. You can freeze them and reheat them for dinner another day. \u0081 Keep it simple\u2014children prefer simple meals. Cooking meals from scratch takes effort, but it's well worth your time. The more healthy, nutrient-dense, chemical-free foods your child eats, the better his brain and body will function. LIMIT EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES The best way to limit your child's exposure to pesticides is to buy organic foods when-ever possible. An organic food has been grown, handled, and processed without the useof articial pesticides, articial fertilizers, sewage sludge, articial additives, hormones,or It doesn't contain genetically modied ingredients and hasn't undergoneirradiation or been chemically ripened. In order for a product to be labeled with theUSDA Organic seal, a government-approved certier must inspect the farm where the food is grown to make sure that the farmer is following all the rules necessary to meetUSDA organic standards. Companies that handle or process organic food before it getsto your local supermarket or restaurant must be certied as well. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has established levels of pesticide residues that are considered safe, but these levels were set based on the studied effectpesticides have on adults and don't take children into account. Children are much morevulnerable to pesticide exposure because of their smaller size and developing brain andnervous system. They may also be more sensitive to pesticides because their detoxica-tion system is less able to adequately process and excrete them. Many people are wor-ried because studies have linked pesticides to cancer and neurological disorders. Theyalso disrupt acetylcholinesterase, a key enzyme needed for brain cell communication.16 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 16Additionally, animal research shows that certain classes of pesticides can affect the developing fetus and impair normal brain development, resulting in hyperactivity andlearning and developmental disabilities. A recent research study indicated that childrenare primarily exposed to pesticides through their diet, and when their foods were re-placed with organic foods, their levels of pesticides dropped dramatically. While youcan't completely control the amount of pesticide your child is exposed to, you cansig- nicantly lower his exposure by purchasing USDA organic foods whenever possible. How to Identify Organic Foods in Your Supermarket Look for the word \"organic\" and a small sticker version of the USDA Organic seal on organic vegetables or pieces of fruit. They may also appear on the sign above the or-ganic produce display. The word \"organic\" and the seal may also appear on packages ofmeat, cartons of milk or eggs, cheese, and other single-ingredient foods. Foods with more than one ingredient are a little trickier. They must have at least 95 percent organic ingredients to be labeled with the USDA Organic seal. Food that's at least 70 percent organic can use the phrase \"made with organic ingredients\" and list upto three of the organic ingredients on the front of the package. If a product is less than70 percent organic, the organic ingredients may be listed on the information panel ofthe package but can't say \"organic\" on the front. It's important to note that not all or-ganic foods will be labeled as such because use of the seal is voluntary, so it's a good ideato read the ingredients list of every product you purchase. Why Are Organic Foods More Expensive? Organic foods cost more because they're produced on a smaller scale, have a lower cropyield, are subject to tighter government regulations, have high-cost farming practices,are allowed a limited number of animals per acre, and pest management is very laborintensive. Organic foods typically cost more than non-organic foods, but prices have been coming down recently because many supermarkets have begun stocking more organicfoods, and large retailers such as Whole Foods Market have become very popular. Evenwith the higher cost, many families are choosing to purchase organic foods for environ-mental and health reasons as well as to limit their exposure to pesticides. AVOID REFINED SUGAR Sucrose, more commonly known as white sugar or table sugar, has typically been the sugar of choice to sweeten food and beverages. Over the last several years, 17 STEP 1: TRANSITION YOUR CHILD TO A HEALTHY DIET0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 17high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has begun to replace (as well as accompany) su- crose in many processed foods in the United States. Sugar and high-fructose corn syrup can be found in soft drinks, fruit juice, candy, peanut butter, yogurt, snacks,ice cream, and many other foods our children eat on a regular basis. In fact, the aver-age American consumes about 140 pounds of sugar each year. Think about howmany empty calories that is! We all know that too much sugar is unhealthy for ourchildren\u2014it contributes to problems like diabetes, obesity, and tooth decay, to namea few. But does it negatively affect their behavior too? The debate over this questionhas been raging for decades. There are many people, particularly parents, teachers,and those in the autism community, who believe there is a definite link betweensugar and behavioral problems. Parents often report that their children's behavior de-teriorates after consuming foods or beverages high in sugar. In one study where pri-mary school teachers were asked to complete a questionnaire, they overwhelminglyresponded that sugar has a negative effect on students' behavior. Almost 91 percentof them also indicated that they believe sugar exacerbates behavioral problems in hy-peractive children. Numerous research studies over the years support the belief thatsugar has a negative impact on behavior, attention, hyperactivity, aggression, mood,and mental function. However, many other research studies conclude just the oppo-site, that sugar has no effect. The observations of parents and teachers that children'sbehavior is linked to sugar has been heavily criticized and refuted by researchers andmost medical professionals. The truth is, sugar does have an effect on children. Sugar is a simple carbohydrate, which means it is rapidly digested and broken down into glucose, which is quickly ab-sorbed into the bloodstream. When your child consumes a sugary food or drink, itcauses a rapid rise in his blood glucose level ( hyperglycemia ). This spike in your child's blood glucose level triggers his pancreas to release the hormone insulin to lower his blood glucose level. This in turn causes his blood glucose level to drop rap-idly (reactive hypoglycemia), triggering the release of adrenaline and other hor- mones to raise his blood glucose level once again. Some children are more sensitivethan others to this abnormal, rapid rise and fall of blood glucose levels, and their bod-ies overreact with a biochemical response that can lead to physical and behavioralsymptoms. Symptoms vary from child to child, depending on their sensitivity, butsome common ones include nervousness, shakiness, light-headedness, dizziness, fa-tigue, sweating, tremors, flushing, confusion, anxiety, headaches, depression, irritabil-ity, and craving sweets. The bottom line is that while sugar does not directly causehyperactivity, it does set into motion biochemical responses in your child's body thatcan lead to behavioral problems. 18 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 18Candy as Positive Reinforcement Unfortunately, many therapists use candy as a reinforcer in behavioral programs or as a reward for good behavior, progress, and achieving goals. I stronglydiscourage this practice, and if I'm working with a child who is given candy asa reward, I ask that the therapist transition to a non-food reinforcer or rewardsystem within two weeks. If the parents and therapist have trouble determiningan appropriate reinforcer/reward system for their child, I suggest they consultwith a behavior therapist. A behavior therapist can analyze your child'sbehavior and suggest individualized recommendations for non-foodreinforcer/rewards that he will respond to. For more information or to locate a behavior therapist, visit the Behavior Analyst Certication Board(BACB) Web site at www.bacb.com. I'm not saying that sugar is bad and should totally be avoided; instead, I encourage you to teach your child how to consume sugar responsibly to lessen its negative impact onhis behavior. Your nutrition goal here is to prevent your child from experiencing hyper-glycemia and reactive hypoglycemia episodes, help him maintain normal blood glucoselevels, and therefore prevent symptoms such as behavioral problems. It's best to avoidhigh-sugar foods and drinks altogether, but that's tough to do. When your child doesconsume these foods, offer it along with another food containing protein. Most proteinfoods are also converted into glucose by the body, but this conversion takes place slowlyand the glucose enters the bloodstream at a slower, more consistent rate. This will bal-ance the effect of sugar and help your child maintain a more stable rise in his blood glu-cose level. Here are some more suggestions to help minimize your child's rened sugarintake: \u0081 First and foremost, avoid high-sugar foods and beverages (anything that contains 15 grams of sugar or more \"per 100 g\") as much as possible. \u0081 Replace high-sugar snacks with healthier ones such as raw vegetable sticks, fresh fruits, nuts, seeds, air-popped popcorn, fruit smoothie, yogurt, pretzels, or ricecakes with fruit spread. \u0081 Feed your child three small meals and two to three snacks about every three hours each day. 19 STEP 1: TRANSITION YOUR CHILD TO A HEALTHY DIET0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 19\u0081 Make sure to provide balanced meals for your child made up of complex carbohy- drates (whole grains, rice, breads, and cereals, starchy vegetables, and legumes), protein, and healthy fats. \u0081 Offer foods that are high in soluble ber, such as legumes, oatmeal, root vegetables, and fruit. \u0081 Limit fruit juice to 4 ounces a day. \u0081 Don't use candy as positive reinforcement or part of a reward system. PROJECT NO. 1: SET THE STAGE FOR A HEALTHIER DIET Call a Family Meeting The rst thing you should do when preparing to transition to a healthier way of eating is to have a family meeting. Gather everyone in your family together and explain why you're all going to start eating healthier. During your discussion, keep the focus on theentire family, not one particular child. (Before you call your family meeting, be sure to discuss this issue with your partner and work out any disagreements about your goalsand how to reach them. It's critical that you present a united front at your familymeeting.) Clean Out Your Kitchen Go through your kitchen cabinets and refrigerator, review the nutrition informationpanel on food products, and make a list of all the foods and beverages that contain arti-cial colors, articial flavors, preservatives, articial sweeteners, high-sugar, and transfat. Gradually, over the next several weeks, replace the products on your list withhealthier alternatives. Often parents are advised to immediately toss out all unhealthyfoods\u2014don't do this. It's unrealistic and may be too overwhelming a change for yourfamily. It's much better not to toss out a food until you've purchased a healthier re-placement. You're much more likely to make a successful, long-term transition to ahealthier diet with this gradual approach. Here's an at-a-glance list of ingredients you should avoid when stocking your health- ier kitchen: Articial Colors: Articial Color FD & C, U.S. Certied Food Color, FD & C, Blue No. 1 (brilliant blue), Blue No. 2 (indigotine), Green No. 3 (fast green), Red No. 40 (allura red), Red No. 3 (erythrosine), Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine),20 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 20 Yellow Sugar, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) Fat: T rans fat, partially hydrogenated oils Now that you've eliminated foods containing chemicals and high-sugar from your child's diet and transitioned him to a healthier diet, you've likely begun to see some realimprovement in his behavior, mood, hyperactivity, ability to pay attention, and overallhealth. (Keep in mind that your child's unique biochemical makeup will dictate howsubtle or signicant his behavioral changes will be.) Now it's time to move on to Step 2\u2014making sure your child is getting the proper amount of basic nutrients.21 STEP 1: TRANSITION YOUR CHILD TO A HEALTHY DIET0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 21STEP 2 Make Sure Your Child Is Getting Enough Basic Nutrients Now that you've transitioned your child to a healthier diet, it's time to focus on making sure that his diet includes enough of the basic nutrients he needs. If your child is lackingbasic nutrients in his diet, his brain and immune, gastrointestinal, and detoxicationsystems will not function to the best of their abilities. In this chapter, you'll learn whyprotein , carbohydrate , fat, vitamins , minerals , and water are so important for your child and how to determine which of these basic nutrients he may be lacking. It's impor-tant to understand that even if your child's weight and height are within normal limits,he still may be \"starving\" for these basic nutrients\u2014your child can easily consumeenough calories from junk foods to gain weight and grow taller. Ensuring your child'sdiet includes all these nutrients is a critical part of helping him function at his best. Unfortunately, eating a poor diet is a very common problem among children with autism. When assessing the nutritional needs of an autistic child, I ask parents to keepa food diary for three days and record everything their child eats and drinks. I've foundthat most autistic kids' diets look something like this: high-sugar dry cereal for break-fast, boxed macaroni and cheese for lunch, and fast-food chicken nuggets and soda fordinner. Snacks are usually junk foods, sweets, and several cups of apple juice. And ofcourse, candy is often offered throughout the day as a positive reinforcer/reward sys-tem. It's obvious that this kind of diet is lacking the protein, calcium, ber, omega-3fatty acids, water, vitamins, and minerals kids need for good health. Most American children don't eat well. Kids with autism aren't the only ones eating substandard diets. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducted a study onchildren ages two to nineteen years and found that only 1 percent of children's dietsmet all dietary requirements. 220738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 22I know that getting your child to eat a diet that includes enough of all the basic nu- trients is easier said than done. Many of the autistic kids I've worked with eat a very limited diet; some will accept only ve or ten different foods. Their parents are frus-trated because they've tried everything they can think of to expand their child's diet,but nothing has worked. Autistic children often refuse new foods, throw tantrumswhen offered a food they don't want to eat, will drink only apple juice, or seem to cravecarbs. If this sounds familiar, then your child will probably not start eating a healthierdiet just because you offer it to him. In Step 5, I discuss feeding problems like these indetail and offer advice on how to get your child to eat healthier foods. The informationyou'll learn here will focus on the basic nutrients, why they're critical for your child,and how much he should be consuming. \"When my child was diagnosed with autism, I felt hopeless. Once I moved past the initial shock and depression, I found the courage to search for answers to help mychild, which started in my kitchen. I learned how to combine foods to provide propernutrition at each meal, added healthy fats into his diet, and made sure he got basicnutrients like calcium and protein in his diet every day. Diet has become anotherpiece of his therapy program. My son is responding well to all his therapies andmoves farther from the spectrum every week.\" \u2014Sharon, mother of a five-year-old boy on the autism spectrum THE BASIC NUTRIENTS As I mentioned earlier, nutrients are divided into six categories: protein, carbohydrate, fat, vitamins, minerals, and water. These basic nutrients provide a total of forty-ve es-sential nutrients, which our bodies are dependent on to sustain life. An essential nutri-ent is a substance that your body is unable to make on its own and must be consumedthrough your diet. Protein provides the essential amino acids linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. PROTEIN Protein is a critically important basic nutrient, especially during infancy, childhood,and adolescence when children are growing and developing rapidly. The body uses23 STEP 2: MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD IS GETTING ENOUGH BASIC NUTRIENTS0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 23 protein to manufacture hormones, antibodies, enzymes, tissue, and neurotransmitters and to repair body cells and produce new ones. Protein can also be turned into glucosefor energy required by the brain when carbohydrates are not available. Lastly, our bod-ies need adequate protein in order to provide amino acids, which are the building blocks of the body. When your child eats a food that contains protein, his body breaks the protein into amino acids that are used throughout his body for various purposes. Some amino acidsare used to produce energy during times of starvation; others are used to produce en-zymes that act as catalysts for biochemical reactions and antibodies to ght off illness.Still others build muscle tissue and generate cell signaling. Several amino acids functionas neurotransmitters to generate cell signaling within the brain. Some of these aminoacids are involved in activities such as learning, memory, and specication of nerves inthe developing brain. If your child eats a poor diet, takes in an insufcient amount of food, or refuses to eat meats, he may have a protein deciency. Signs of a protein deciency include thefollowing:24 EATING FOR AUTISM \u0081 stunted growth \u0081 poor muscle mass\u0081 edema\u0081 thin and fragile hair\u0081 decreased mental alertness, comprehension, and concentration As you can see, protein plays a major role in both your child's body and brain function. How Much Protein Your Child Should Eat The chart below shows the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of protein your child should be eating based on his age. While the RDA chart will give you a good ideaof the minimum amount of protein your child requires, keep in mind that he may needmore protein, depending on variables such as illness, infections, stress, and genetics. It'sbest for a registered dietitian (RD) to assess your child's nutritional status and deter-mine his individual protein needs and whether he's meeting them in his current diet.The RD may want to run some blood tests\u2014for your child's protein status. (See Ap- pendix 1 on page 213 for more information on Registered Dietitians and how to locateone in your community.) 0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 24Choosing the Best Sources of Protein When choosing protein-rich foods for your child, your best choices are complete pro- teins , or proteins that contain all of the essential amino acids. Complete proteins are found in foods such as: \u0081 beef \u0081 eggs \u0081 cheese \u0081 pork \u0081 soymilk You can also offer your child incomplete proteins , or proteins that lack one or more of the essential amino acids. Dietary sources of incomplete proteins include: \u0081 beans \u0081 seeds \u0081 peas \u0081 grains \u0081 nuts Different incomplete proteins can be combined to form a complete protein, meaning together they provide your child with all of the essential amino acids. This combination is called a complementary protein. An example of a complementary25 STEP 2: MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD IS GETTING ENOUGH BASIC NUTRIENTS Recommended Daily Allowance for Protein AGE PROTEIN (GRAMS/DAY) Children 1-3 years 13 4-8 years 19 Males 9-13 years 34 14-18 years 52 19 years and older 56AGE PROTEIN (GRAMS/DAY) Females 9-13 years 34 14 years and older 46 Source: Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 25protein combination is beans combined with brown rice, wheat, nuts, seed, or corn; and brown rice combined with beans, wheat, nuts or seeds. See Appendix 2 for a fulllist of good dietary sources of protein and serving sizes. When to Feed Your Child Protein Many of your child's body and brain functions depend on a steady influx of aminoacids throughout the day to function properly. This is especially true for the aminoacids acting as neurotransmitters in his brain. Since the body is unable to store excessdietary amino acids for later use, you need to divide your child's daily protein require-ment throughout the day, ideally over three meals and two snacks. Providing your childprotein at every meal and snack will also help to stabilize his blood glucose levels,which will prevent hyperglycemia and reactive hypoglycemia (see Step 1 for more in-formation on these conditions). Many children with autism have severe feeding problems and consume a very lim- ited variety of foods, which often results in a protein deciency. If you're unable to in-crease your child's intake of high-protein foods, giving him a protein powdersupplement is a good option until his diet can be expanded. There are rice, pea, soy,and whey protein supplements available that your child can use, or if he suffers from one or more food allergy or sensitivity, he could try a free amino acid-based proteinsupplement. As an alternative to protein supplements, you could try adding strainedbaby food meats to your child's foods. Baby food meats are an excellent source of high-quality protein that you can sneak into gravies, sauces, and various recipes. If you de-cide to give your child a protein supplement or add baby food meats to his food, youmust rst determine how much protein your child is getting from his current diet soyou know how much more you need to add to help him reach his RDA. Then youshould start with a very small amount and gradually increase the quantity each day overthe span of a few weeks. Many children with autism have sensory processing disorderor sensory processing issues, which makes them very sensitive to changes in their fa-vorite foods. These kids will reject food with even the slightest difference in flavor,odor, color, or texture. Therefore you must take the process of adding a supplement toyour child's food very slowly to avoid rejection. It's a good idea to consult a registereddietitian before giving your child a protein supplement. CARBOHYDRATE Carbohydrates, or \"carbs,\" are the body's primary source of energy. Proteins and fatscan also serve as energy sources, but the body prefers carbohydrates because they are26 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 26more easily converted to glucose. Glucose is the only source of energy the brain can use, so it's important that children take in enough carbohydrates to maintain a constantsupply of glucose to the brain. This keeps their brains functioning at their optimumlevel throughout the day. There are two major types of carbohydrates: simple carbohy- drates and Monosaccharides, such as glucose, fructose, and galactose are composed of a single sugar unit, whereasdisaccharides, such as sucrose, lactose, and maltose are composed of two sugar units.Simple carbohydrates are found in rened sugars, like the white sugar you'd see in asugar bowl. Examples of simple carbohydrates are honey, corn syrup, high-fructosecorn syrup, molasses, candy, soda, and sweets. Fruits and milk are also classied assimple carbohydrates, but they're considered nutrient-rich simple carbohydrates be-cause they contain vitamins, minerals, ber, and important nutrients like calcium andprotein. Complex carbohydrates are polysaccharides, which consist of many sugar units strung together to form long, complex chains. Examples of complex carbohydrates in-clude foods such as rice, potatoes, peas, beans, corn, and whole grain products likeflour, bread, and pasta. As with simple carbohydrates, some complex carbohydrates arebetter choices than others. Rened complex carbohydrates, such as white flour and white rice, have been processed, which removes nutrients and ber. But unrenedgrains still contain their original vitamins and minerals. Unrened grains also are rich in ber, which helps your child's digestive system work well. Choosing the Right Carbohydrates for Your Child Unrefined complex carbohydrates and nutrient-rich simple carbohydrates are far bet-ter choices than simple and refined complex carbohydrates. As I discussed in Step 1,simple carbohydrates (with the exception of fruit and milk) are digested, brokendown into glucose, and enter the bloodstream rapidly, which causes hyperglycemiaand reactive hypoglycemia. On the other hand, complex carbohydrates are digested,broken down into glucose, and enter the bloodstream slowly, which in turn stabilizesyour child's blood glucose levels. The protein in milk and fiber in fruit prevent them from triggering the rapid fluctuation in blood glucose levels as do other simple carbohydrates. Another helpful guide to choosing the right carbohydrates for your child is to con- sider their ranking on the glycemic index. The glycemic index ranks carbohydrates based on how they affect blood glucose levels. Carbohydrates that are digested slowly,resulting in a gradual release of glucose into the bloodstream, have a low glycemic27 STEP 2: MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD IS GETTING ENOUGH BASIC NUTRIENTS0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 27 index. Carbohydrates that are digested more quickly, resulting in a rapid release of glu- cose into the bloodstream, have a higher glycemic index. If your child is sensitive tofluctuations in his blood glucose levels, he may benet from eating carbohydrates witha lower glycemic index. When he does eat a carbohydrate with a high glycemic index,he should combine it with another food that contains healthy fats, protein, or ber tolower the glycemic index effect. The chart below categorizes common foods as low,medium, and high glycemic index for your convenience.28 EATING FOR AUTISM GLYCEMIC CLASSIFICATION INDEX RANGE FOODS Low 55 or less Whole grains, dried beans and peas, pinto beans, lentils, brown rice, popcorn, rice bran cereal, Kellogg's All Bran Fruit & Oatscereal, Special K cereal, soymilk, milk,macaroni, spaghetti, orange juice, applejuice, fruit cocktail, most fruits (exceptwatermelon), and vegetables (except potatoes).

It's considered a complex carbohydrate, but it passes through the human digestive system virtually unchanged, without being brokendown into nutrients. Many children with autism have gastrointestinal problems (turnto Step 6 for an in-depth discussion on this topic), and getting an adequate amount ofber is key to healing their gastrointestinal tracts and promoting normal daily bowelmovements, which help rid their bodies of toxins. There are two types of ber: solubleand insoluble. Soluble ber resists digestion and absorption in the small intestine and undergoes fer- mentation in the large intestine. This process results in a broad range of health benets.For instance, short-chain fatty acids are created that promote increased proliferation ofbacteria such as Bidobacteria and Lactobacilli, which help keep the intestines healthy. Inaddition, soluble ber lowers LDL (bad) cholesterol levels, helps prevent colon cancer,and keeps blood sugar levels stable by slowing the digestion of carbohydrates and the sub-sequent release of glucose into the blood. Soluble ber is found in beans, peas, soybeans,psyllium seed husk, oats, barley, fruits, prune juice, and root vegetables. Insoluble ber absorbs water as it passes through the intestinal tract, softening stool, increasing stool bulk, and keeping things moving through the colon. Insolubleber is found in whole grain products, bran, nuts, seeds, vegetables, and skins of fruits. There are three ways to gure out how much ber your child should be consuming: 1. A study by the Child Health Center recommends that children over two years of age consume an amount of ber that equals their age in years plus 5 grams per day (e.g., for a six-year-old child, 6 + 5 = 11 grams ber per day). 2. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends children eat 0.5 grams ber per kilogram body weight. To determine your child's body weight in kilograms,divide his weight in pounds by 2.2 (e.g., for a 46-pound child, 46 \u00f7 2.2 \u00d7 0.5 =10\u00bdgrams ber per day). 3. The Institute of Medicine has set the adequate intake of ber at 19 grams for one to three year olds; 25 grams for four to eight year olds; 31 grams for nine- to thirteen-year-old males; 38 grams 26 for nine- toeighteen-year-old females; and 25 grams for nineteen- to fty-year-old females. I usually use the rst or second method because it's a lower amount. Autistic chil- dren are already typically consuming a very small amount of dietary ber, so I prefer tostart low and gradually increase the amount of ber in a child's diet. T urn to Appendix 2 on page 216 for a list of high-ber foods.29 STEP 2: MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD IS GETTING ENOUGH BASIC NUTRIENTS0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 29Do Autistic Children Crave Carbs? I can't tell you how many parents I've worked with who believe their child craves or is addicted to carbs. This concept is part of something called the Opiate Excess The-ory, which I discuss in detail in Step 8. It's a controversial topic, and the medicalcommunity is divided over it. Based on my years of clinical experience, I can tell youthat children with autism do consume an excess amount of simple and rened com-plex carbohydrates. Over the years, I've analyzed hundreds of three-day food di-aries, and I've seen that autistic children's diets consist mainly of the following fewfoods: chicken nuggets, pizza, French fries, macaroni and cheese, crackers, Goldshcrackers, cookies, pancakes, apple juice, and some fruits. With the exception of thechicken nuggets, which are a source of protein and carbohydrate, the other foodsare primarily simple and rened complex carbohydrates. This preference for mainlyunhealthy carbohydrates is a huge nutritional concern. There's speculation that some children crave carbohydrates in response to the rapid brain growth that occurs during certain periods of their lives. Brain growthspurts occur between the ages of three and ve, nine and eleven, and twelve andfourteen years. Interconnections within the brain increase dramatically during thesetimes, helping the brain develop the ability to function at a higher level. During agrowth spurt, there's an increase in synaptic connections between brain cells and anincrease in neurotransmitter production and activity, which requires a larger-than- normal amount of glucose. As you now know, glucose is the only source of energythe brain can use, and carbohydrates are the primary source of glucose. It's possiblethat some children increase their intake of carbohydrates to meet this increased en-ergy demand of their brain. Rather than limiting carbohydrates during these time pe-riods, you should focus on providing your child with healthy, unrened complexcarbohydrates and nutrient-rich simple carbohydrates along with adequate protein. FAT Our bodies need fat to function properly. Besides being an energy source, fat is a nu- trient used in the production of cell membranes, as well as in several hormonelikecompounds called eicosanoids. These compounds help regulate blood pressure, heartrate, blood vessel constriction, blood clotting, and the nervous system. In addition,30 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 30 dietary fat carries fat-soluble vitamins\u2014vitamins A, D, E, and K\u2014from our food into our bodies. Fat helps maintain healthy hair and skin, protects vital organs, keeps ourbodies insulated, and provides a sense of fullness after meals. It's also critical for brainfunction, especially in the developing brain of a child. About two-thirds of the hu-man brain is composed of fats. The myelin sheath, which serves as a protective insu-lating cover for communicating neurons (brain cells), is composed of 70 percent fat. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is the most abundant fat in the brain. DHA is an omega-3 essential fatty acid, which means that the body can't produce it and, there-fore, must be consumed through our diet. Essential fatty acids are key buildingblocks of the brain and a deficiency will compromise your child's brain function,ability to learn, memory, attention, and behavior. In fact, omega-3 fatty acid defi-ciencies have been linked to autism, dyslexia, ADHD, dyspraxia, and depression.(See Step 4 for more information on the critical role omega-3 fatty acids play in yourchild's brain function.) Types of Fat As you can see, children need to take in a certain amount of fat for healthy brain andnervous system development. However, there are healthy fats and unhealthy fats, andit's important to make sure you're offering your child mainly healthy fats. Healthy fats \u0081Monounsaturated fat is liquid at room temperature. Foods high in monounsatu- rated fat include olive, peanut, soybean, and canola oils as well as avocados, olives,and most nuts. \u0081Polyunsaturated fat is liquid at room temperature. Foods high in polyunsatu- rated fats include sh as well as vegetable oils such as safflower, corn, sunflower,soy, and peanut oils. \u0081Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fats found mostly in seafood. Good sources of omega-3s include fatty, cold-water sh such as salmon, walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids, andsmall amounts are found in soybean and canola oils. These fats are considered healthy because they lower LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise HDL (good) cholesterol, reducing the risk of coronary heart disease in adults. The31 STEP 2: MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD IS GETTING ENOUGH BASIC NUTRIENTS0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 31polyunsaturated fats, particularly the omega-3 fatty acids, are especially healthy for children because they're necessary for brain development and function. Unhealthy fats \u0081Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature and commonly found in meat; animal products such butter, cheese, ice cream, and whole milk; separatedanimal fats (tallow and lard); and palm and coconut oils. \u0081Trans fat is a common ingredient in commercial baked goods such as crackers, cookies, cakes and chips, and foods fried in partially hydrogenated oils. Vegetableshortenings and some margarines also are high in trans fat. It's ne for your child to eat foods containing saturated fats\u2014just make sure he's eat- ing limited amounts. Too much saturated fat can raise total cholesterol and LDL cho-lesterol, which increases the risk of coronary heart disease in adults. Unfortunately,many parents are told that they should eliminate fat and cholesterol from their child'sdiet\u2014this is bad advice. For example, cholesterol is a major component of the myelinsheath in the brain and is critical to your child's brain development and function. Thecommon recommendations adults are given to lower their fat and cholesterol intake arenot appropriate for infants and young children. My advice is to limit saturated fat andtrans fat, select more monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, and include omega-3fatty acids in your child's daily diet. Your child needs fats as part of a healthy diet. MICRONUTRIENTS Our bodies need micronutrients, also known as vitamins and minerals, in smallamounts for normal growth, function, and health. Our bodies don't make most mi-cronutrients, so we have to get them from the food we eat or, in some cases, from di-etary supplements. Vitamins and minerals are critical for brain development andfunction; regulating cell and tissue growth; processing and eliminating toxins from thebody; maintaining a healthy gastrointestinal tract; supporting immune system func-tion; converting protein, carbohydrate, and fat into energy; providing structure tobones; formation of blood; and numerous other body functions. Some vitamins alsofunction as hormones, antioxidants, coenzymes, and precursors for enzymes. Each vita-min and mineral is unique and has its own specic role in the body. The most important vitamins and minerals for brain function are calcium, iron, and some of the B vitamins:32 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 32\u0081 Calcium is required for the transmission of nerve impulses in the brain and aids in the release of neurotransmitters from neurons. \u0081 Iron transports oxygen to the brain and is also needed to produce the neurotrans- mitter dopamine. A deciency of iron can cause fatigue, impaired mental func- tion, poor work and school performance, and decreased attention span, learning,and memory. \u0081 Vitamin B 1(thiamin) aids normal functioning of the nervous system and a de- ciency can result in mental confusion and complications involving the brain. \u0081 Vitamin B2(riboflavin) is required by the body for the production of energy, to form glutathione, and to convert vitamin B6to pyridoxal 5-phosphate. \u0081 Vitamin B6(pyridoxine) helps the body break down protein and helps maintain the health of red blood cells, the nervous system, and parts of the immune system.Vitamin B 6is also involved in the production of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine, and a deciency may result in depression and confusion. \u0081 Vitamin B12(cobalamin) is involved in the production of certain amino acids, maintenance of the nervous system, formation of the myelin sheath, formation ofneurotransmitters, and plays a role in preventing depression and other mood dis-orders. A B 12deciency can cause fatigue, confusion, delayed development, poor memory, depression, and neurological changes. \u0081 Folic acid helps the body produce and maintain healthy new cells, especially dur- ing periods of rapid growth. A deciency of folic acid may result in loss of ap-petite, irritability, forgetfulness, and behavioral disorders. If your child is decient in any vitamin or mineral, his brain won't be able to func- tion at its optimum level. This in turn will prevent your child from fully benetingfrom his various therapies and special education services. Say, for example, your childhas an iron deciency, which is a very common problem among children. As you nowknow, iron is essential to transport oxygen to the brain and is also involved in the pro-duction of the neurotransmitter dopamine. A low iron level could cause your child toexperience symptoms such as apathy, short attention span, irritability, impaired mem-ory, and reduced ability to learn. A recent study indicates that iron deciency interfereswith dopamine activity and may contribute to ADHD. Correcting the iron deciencyresulted in considerable improvement in these children's ADHD symptoms and cogni-tive test scores. If just one mineral deciency can have such a signicant impact onyour child's brain function, imagine how several vitamin and mineral deciencies canaffect your child! Kids need to eat a variety of foods from all ve food groups to get the33 STEP 2: MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD IS GETTING ENOUGH BASIC NUTRIENTS0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 33basic vitamins and minerals they need for good brain and body function. However, autistic children tend to eat a very poor diet made up of only a few foods, so they oftensuffer from several vitamin and mineral deciencies. If this is the case for your child,he'll likely need to take a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement until you're ableto expand his diet. I discuss this topic in more detail in Step 3. The autism community is particularly interested in vitamins B 6, B12, and C because there's some evidence that they can relieve some autistic symptoms when adminis-tered at higher therapeutic levels. I cover the therapeutic use of these vitamins insteps 9 and 10. HOW MUCH VITAMINS AND MINERALS YOUR CHILD SHOULD CONSUME The levels of vitamins and minerals your child should consume are based on the Di- etary Reference Intake (DRI), which is a system of nutrition recommendations from the Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. Itconsists of four nutrient-based reference values that were developed for different ageand gender groups and are based on the average requirements for healthy individuals.Keep in mind that you should use only the DRI values as a guide because your child'sactual requirements for a particular nutrient may be more or less. Here's an at-a-glancedescription of the four nutrient-based values: 1. The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) is the average daily nutrient in- take level estimated to meet the requirements of 50 percent of healthy individu-als in a particular age and gender group. 2. The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is the daily nutrient intake suf- cient to meet the requirements of 97 to 98 percent of healthy individuals in aparticular age and gender group. 3. The Adequate Intake (AI) is the daily nutrient intake estimated to be adequate for a group of healthy individuals. It's used when a RDA has not been deter-mined yet. 4. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is the highest daily nutrient intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects. It's designed to cautionagainst excessive intake of nutrients that may be harmful in large amounts. You probably recognize the Recommended Daily Allowance value\u2014it's the most commonly used nutrient standard on food packages. What you need to understand34 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 34about RDA values is that they're based on the assumption that your child is healthy. The RDA doesn't take into account the fact that your child may be on medications,have a chronically poor diet, or have a gastrointestinal disorder that prevents him fromproperly absorbing nutrients. It's also important to know that RDA values used forchildren are extrapolated from adult research. Some people are concerned that theRDAs don't adequately reflect the amount of nutrients kids need for optimum mentalfunctioning. Clearly, the RDA isn't perfect, but it's the best standard currently avail-able. When deciding how much vitamins and minerals your child should consume, Irecommend that you make sure he gets at least 100 percent of the RDA. If you decideyou want to give your child more than the RDA for a particular nutrient, don't exceedthe UL (Tolerable Upper Intake Level). For a list of essential vitamins and minerals,their RDA or AI and UL, turn to Appendix 3 on page 222. WATER Water is the most basic nutrient our bodies need, and it's also one of the most neglectedcomponents of our diet. Our bodies need a certain amount of water each day forproper body temperature regulation, muscle function, absorption of nutrients, trans-porting nutrients into body cells, transporting waste out of body cells, and the elimina-tion of waste and toxins from the body. We get water not only from drinking it, butalso from other liquids such as milk and juice and from vegetables and fruits. If wedon't have enough water in our diet, we are at risk for dehydration, which is a condi-tion in which the body doesn't contain enough water to function properly. For a varietyof reasons, infants and children are more prone to dehydration than adults. Symptomsof mild dehydration include the following: \u0081 thirst \u0081 urine volume \u0081 headache\u0081 tiredness \u0081 slightly sunken eyes In autistic children, these symptoms can be easily missed. Autistic children often have expressive language delays or are nonverbal and unable to express their thirst. Some autistic kids don't recognize the sensation of thirst and therefore never ask fordrinks. This makes them especially susceptible to dehydration. Dehydration symptomsare also often mistakenly attributed to something else. For instance, some multivitaminand mineral supplements can darken children's urine, and it may not occur to you that35 STEP 2: MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD IS GETTING ENOUGH BASIC NUTRIENTS0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 35dehydration may be to blame instead. Subtle though the symptoms may be, dehydra- tion will have a major impact on how your child feels both physically and mentally, hisability to function normally, and his ability to participate in and benet from his ther-apy sessions. Babies and small children have an increased chance of becoming dehydrated because \u0081 a greater portion of their bodies is made of water; \u0081 they have a higher metabolic rate than adults, so their bodies use more water;\u0081 a child's kidneys don't conserve water as well as an adult's does;\u0081 a child's immune system is not fully developed, which increases the chance of getting an illness that causes vomiting and diarrhea; \u0081 children often refuse to drink or eat when they don't feel well;\u0081 and they depend on their caregivers to provide them with food and fluids. To ensure your child is both quenching his thirst and getting enough water (espe- cially if he's nonverbal or you suspect he may not recognize the sensation of thirst), you should offer him water several times a day. If your child doesn't currently drink water orrefuses it, it's probably because he's drinking too much juice or milk. Your child shouldbe drinking two to three cups of milk and only one cup of juice a day. The rest of hisfluid needs should be provided as drinking water. If your child is drinking more thanone cup of juice a day right now, start cutting him back by diluting his juice 50 percentwith water and gradually decrease him to one cup a day. High-sugar beverages shouldbe eliminated from his diet altogether. How Much Water Your Child Should Drink The chart below lists the total amount of water your child should consume on a dailybasis. When I say total water, I mean everything\u2014drinking water, beverages, and watercontained in foods (fruits and vegetables contain 85 to 95 percent water). The amountof total water your child needs will vary according to the level of his physical activity,medical problems, and weather environment in which you live. A registered dietitiancan calculate more exactly the total amount of water your child requires based on hisindividual needs. Eliminating Toxins from Your Child's Drinking Water It's important to consider the source of the water you're giving your child, because safe,uncontaminated drinking water is vital to his health. In the autism community, neuro-toxins are a major concern and many parents try to eliminate heavy metals from their36 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 36children's environment as much as possible. Common sources of water pollutants in- clude the following: \u0081 biological agents (bacteria, viruses, and parasites) \u0081 inorganic chemicals (arsenic, lead, mercury, chromium, and nitrates)\u0081 organic chemicals (pesticides, benzene, polychlorinated biphenyls, and trichloroethylene) \u0081 disinfectant chemicals (chlorine, acid, and trihalomethanes) \u0081 and radionuclides (radon) These pollutants can affect major body organs such as the kidneys and liver; pro- mote certain forms of cancer, leukemia, and anemia; and may affect the neurological and gastrointestinal systems. Public Tap Water Under the authority of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), the EPA has set stan-dards for approximately ninety contaminants in public tap water. For each of thesecontaminants, the EPA has set a legal limit, called a maximum contaminant level, or re-quires a certain treatment. Water suppliers are not allowed to provide water that doesn't37 STEP 2: MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD IS GETTING ENOUGH BASIC NUTRIENTS Adequate Intake (AI) of Water TOTAL WATER Age Group Liters/day Cups/day Children 1-3 years 1.3 5 4-8 years 1.7 7 Males 9-13 years 2.4 10 14-18 years 3.3 14 19 years and older 3.7 15 Females 9-13 years 2.1 9 14-18 years 2.3 10 19 years and older 2.7 11 Source: Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, National Academies0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 37meet these standards. However, there are concerns that some of the standards for con- taminants are set too high and don't protect the public against health problems. The al-lowable amount of pesticides in our public drinking water is of particular concernbecause there's been little research done on how chronic and mixed exposure to differ-ent pesticides may affect our children neurologically. Private Well Water Private water wells are not federally regulated, and testing of the water is the responsi-bility of the individual homeowner. There are numerous common contaminants foundin well water. Certain contaminants should be tested for at least once, others at leastonce a year, and still others every ve years, or prior to pregnancy or when an infant isborn. For information on how to test your well water, contact your state health and en-vironmental agencies. Some state agencies and local health departments provide thetesting for free. Home Water Purification System Before you buy a home water purication system, I recommend that you have your wa-ter (public or well) tested by a certied laboratory. You can go to the EPA's Web site(http://www.epa.gov/safewater/labs/index.html) or call 800-426-4791 to locate a Cer-tied Drinking Water Laboratory in your state and nd out how to go about gettingyour water tested. Once you know what specic chemicals are in your water, then youcan decide whether you want to invest in a home water purication system. There are two styles of water purification systems. A point-of-entry system filters all the water you use in your home from the point at which it enters your home. Apoint-of-use system is generally a filter mounted to a faucet or installed under a sink and filters water only where it's installed. There are also many types of systems tochoose from\u2014absorption filters, reverse osmosis, softeners, distillers, and ultraviolet,to name a few. Whichever water purification system you choose, make sure that it'scertified by the NSF . NSF International is an independent tester of water purifica-tion systems that evaluates the manufacturer claims of reducing various contami-nants and assures the consumer that the product meets performance requirements.For more detailed information on water purification systems, visit NFS Interna-tional's Web site at www.nsf.org. Bottled Water The major types of bottled water are mineral water, spring water, artesian water,sparkling water, puried water, and fluoridated water. Bottled water is regulated by the38 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 38FDA and must meet EPA tap water standards; however, it's not necessarily more pure than public tap water. If you choose to drink bottled water, make sure the brand youchoose is certied by NSF International. NSF has developed a voluntary certicationprogram for bottled water, so rst look for the NSF label on the bottle. If you don't seeit, you can contact NSF International at www.nsf.org or 800-NSF-MARK (800-673-6275) to see if the brand you've chosen is certied or to get a list of bottled water com-panies that they've certied. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER The chart below serves two purposes. First, you can quickly assess whether your child isgetting enough nutrients from the right variety of foods and in the proper amounts. Af-ter you've gured out what areas of your child's diet need work, you can use the chart toplan his meals and ensure he's getting the nourishment he needs.

Is your child consuming adequate water?Fat:Did your child have at least 1 serving of a healthy unsaturated fat each day?Variety of food groups (meat, milk, bread, fruit, and vegetables): Add up the total number of servings your child consumed from each of the food groups and divide by three for a daily average for each food group. Compare toyour child's recommended number of servings. Is he consuming an appropriate number of servings from each food group? Did your child consume at least 1 serving from each of the food groups at each meal? Did your child eat three meals and two to three snacks each day? 3. Choose a source of safe drinking water for your child. Have your tap or well water tested by a Certied Drinking Water Laboratory. Based on the results, consider buying a home water purication system thatcan remove the contaminants in your drinking water. The goal of Step 2 is to make sure you're offering your child a variety of foods that con-tain the basic nutrients he needs for his body and brain to work to the best of their abil-ity. Once you accomplish this, you'll have successfully laid a solid foundation for allother autism therapies to build upon. Now it's time to choose a daily multivitamin andmineral supplement for your child.41 STEP 2: MAKE SURE YOUR CHILD IS GETTING ENOUGH BASIC NUTRIENTS0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 41STEP 3 Choose a Daily Multivitamin and Mineral Supplement for Your Child Many healthcare professionals believe that vitamin and mineral supplements are un- necessary and that children can get everything they need just by eating a well-balanceddiet. This may well be true for children who eat a variety of healthy foods, have a prop-erly functioning digestive system that can digest and absorb the nutrients consumed,and whose bodies are able to utilize the nutrients absorbed. Unfortunately, most chil-dren with autism do not fall into this category. Children with autism often eat a verylimited variety of foods. They often have mealtime behavior problems that interferewith their food consumption. Many have sensory problems that impact their accep-tance of certain textures, flavors, and smells of foods, resulting in feeding problems.Some kids are on elimination diets that limit their intake of certain nutritious foods.Still other kids have chronic gastrointestinal disorders that interfere with their ability todigest and absorb nutrients properly. All of these factors make children with autism farmore vulnerable to having chronic vitamin and mineral deciencies. Severe vitamin and mineral deciencies, such as scurvy (a vitamin C deciency that can result in spongy, bleeding gums, loss of teeth, nosebleeds, and, if left untreated,death), are rare in the United States. However, marginal vitamin and mineral decien-cies are very common. A marginal vitamin or mineral deciency can result from achronically poor diet, which impacts your child slowly, over time, with more subtlesymptoms. Marginal vitamin and mineral deciency symptoms include the following: \u0081 poor attention and concentration \u0081 irritability\u0081 loss of appetite 420738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 42\u0081 mood and behavior changes \u0081 depression\u0081 anxiety\u0081 sleep disturbances\u0081 susceptibility to acute illnesses such as colds and infections\u0081 increased risk for developing degenerative diseases and cancer Marginal deciencies can affect your child globally, meaning they can prevent both his body and his brain from functioning at their best. Your child will be physically and mentally unable to fully respond to, participate in, and benet from his therapies.While vitamin and mineral supplements can't replicate all the nutrients your childwould get from whole foods, they're a good complement to his diet. HOW TO SELECT A HIGH-QUALITY, OVER-THE-COUNTER VITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENT Vitamin and mineral supplements are a multibillion dollar industry in the United States, and there are literally thousands of products on the market to choose from withvarying degrees of quality. The FDA regulates dietary supplements to some extent, butnot to the same degree they do drugs. Supplement manufacturers don't need any gov-ernmental agency approval to produce and sell their products, nor does the FDA evalu-ate the efcacy of supplements on the market. This means that some multivitamin andmineral supplements on the market don't actually contain the ingredients or the ingre-dient quantity listed on the product label, may have harmful levels of contaminants, ormay not break down in the digestive tract and be released into the body. Many parentsget confused and overwhelmed when trying to select a supplement for their child. Tosimplify the task, I've listed ve criteria to help you choose a high-quality daily multivi-tamin and mineral supplement that's right for your child. Check Quality Control Procedures Some supplement manufacturers voluntarily choose to have their products tested byan independent lab to verify their product's integrity, purity, and potency. Three com-mon independent labs that test dietary supplements are the U.S. Pharmacopeia(USP), the National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF), and ConsumerLab.Each lab has its own testing standards and product verication program. The stan-dards typically include:43 STEP 3: CHOOSE A DAILY MULTIVITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENT FOR YOUR CHILD0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 43\u0081 The ingredients of the supplement match what is listed on the product label. \u0081 The supplement doesn't contain harmful levels of contaminants.\u0081 The supplement will break down and release ingredients into the body.\u0081 The supplement was manufactured using safe, sanitary, and well-controlled procedures. If a supplement manufacturer chooses to participate in the verication program and passes the testing standards, they may put the verication seal on their product label.Look for the USP , , or ConsumerLab seal on multivitamin and mineral supple-ment product labels. For more information on these independent labs, and to learnwhich supplement manufacturers participate in their verication programs, visit theirWeb sites at: www.usp.org/uspveried/dietarysupplements, www.nsf.org/business/dietarysupplements, and www.consumerlab.com/seal. Make Sure There's a Broad Spectrum of Vitamins and Minerals The product you choose should contain the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, and E; water-soluble vitamins magnesium, zinc, selenium, manganese, chromium, and molybdenum. You also might want to consider a calcium supplement. Vitamin and mineral sup- plements usually don't provide adequate amounts of calcium and other minerals. Ifyour child is not getting enough calcium in his diet, you may need to give him a cal-cium supplement in addition to a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement. A cal-cium supplement is especially important if your child is on the Gluten Free Casein FreeDiet. Research shows that autistic children's bones are thinner and less dense than thebones of children without autism. The research also indicates that autistic children on aGluten Free Casein Free Diet have the thinnest bones of all\u201420 percent thinner thankids without autism. Make Sure It Provides at Least 100 Percent of the RDA The product you choose should contain at least 100 percent and as much as 200 to 300percent of your child's RDA for most of the vitamins and minerals. But avoid mega-dosing at this stage. The RDA is designed to prevent a vitamin and mineral deciencyin healthy individuals and doesn't take into account that each individual has a uniquebiochemical makeup. It also doesn't take into consideration that your child may have achronically poor diet, use medications, or have a gastrointestinal disorder that preventshim from properly absorbing nutrients. This means that your child may need morethan 100 percent of the RDA for his brain and body to function at its best. For this44 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 44reason, I typically suggest parents give their child a daily multivitamin and mineral sup- plement that contains at least 100 percent of the child's RDA and as much as 200 to300 percent. Most vitamins and minerals can be increased to 200 to 300 percent of theRDA without exceeding the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) (magnesium andniacin are exceptions to this rule). When using vitamins and minerals that don't have aUL determined yet, such as vitamin K and chromium, you should limit it to 100 per-cent of your child's RDA. At this stage, I do not recommend giving megadoses (1,000percent the RDA) of vitamins and minerals. Megadoses of some vitamins, such as thefat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), can be potentially toxic. Vitamins A and D cancause liver damage, and vitamin B 6can cause irreversible nerve damage. Megadoses of certain minerals can also be detrimental to your child's health. For instance, too muchzinc can suppress the immune system and alter iron function. Iron can increase freeradicals, intensifying cell damage, which may contribute to cancer. I recommend thatyou not give your child more than the UL of a vitamin or mineral without rst con-sulting with a nutrition-oriented physician or registered dietitian. In Step 9, I discussthe use of individual nutrients such as vitamin B 6at megadose levels, not to correct a deciency, but to raise blood levels above normal to achieve a pharmacological effectthat may improve autistic symptoms. Avoid Certain Ingredients The product you select should be free of articial colors, articial flavors, additives, herbs,unrecognized substances, and common allergens like wheat, milk, soy, egg, and corn. Buy from a Reputable Company There are many excellent high-quality multivitamin and mineral supplements on themarket that do not choose to participate in the USP , NSF , or ConsumerLab vericationprogram. Many supplement manufacturers choose to have their vitamin and mineralsupplements tested by other independent laboratories to verify the quality of theirproducts. These manufacturers have high internal standards of quality, including po-tency; purity in regard to heavy metals, pesticides, and other environmental contami-nants; and are free of common allergens such as gluten, casein, soy, corn, and starch.Their products are also usually free of articial colors and flavors. When researchingreputable companies, your best bet is to go with a company that has a pharmaceuticalbackground. Kirkman is a good example of a well-known reputable company that alsohappens to specialize in nutritional supplements formulated for children on the autismspectrum. For more information on Kirkman and the products it offers, visit its Website www.kirkmangroup.com or call toll-free at (800) 245-8282.45 STEP 3: CHOOSE A DAILY MULTIVITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENT FOR YOUR CHILD0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 45CUSTOM-MADE VITAMIN AND MINERAL FORMULAS An alternative to buying an over-the-counter multivitamin and mineral supplement is to have a vitamin and mineral formula custom-made for your child. After assessing yourchild, a registered dietitian or a physician prescribes the exact vitamins, minerals, anddosages he needs to function at his best. For example, if your child's immune systemneeds a boost, his custom formula will contain higher amounts of antioxidants. If his cog-nitive function needs enhancement, the dosages of B vitamins will be increased. If yourchild has iron deciency anemia, iron can be added to his formula. If he's on a GlutenFree Casein Free Diet and not getting enough calcium in his diet, calcium can be added. Customizing your child's vitamin and mineral formula has many advantages over buying an over-the-counter product. First and foremost, it's tailored to meet yourchild's unique needs, which is ideal. It also enables you to avoid buying multiple bottlesof supplements (if your child also needs an iron and/or calcium supplement), reducesthe number of supplements he needs to take each day, and simplies his supplementprogram. Custom-made vitamin and mineral formulas are also superior because they \u0081 are compounded by a pharmacist; \u0081 are higher quality than over-the-counter formulas;\u0081 are often covered by health insurance plans;\u0081 can easily be adjusted as your child's needs change;\u0081 are usually less costly than purchasing multiple supplement bottles;\u0081 are free of allergens, unnatural llers, binders, articial colors, articial flavors, and additives; \u0081 can be naturally sweetened and flavored;\u0081 and are available in various delivery options (liquid, powder, or capsules). To locate a pharmacy that can compound a vitamin and mineral supplement in your area, try searching the Internet. (Using the key words \"compounding pharmacy\" turns up quite a few hits.) You can also contact a compounding pharmacy that I've workedwith for a number of years: the Village Green Apothecary, at www.myvillagegreen.com. GETTING YOUR CHILD TO TAKE A MULTIVITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENT Once you've chosen a supplement for your child, the real challenge begins\u2014getting him to take it every day. Your child may not be able to swallow capsules yet, or refuses46 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 46to eat a chewable vitamin or drink a liquid supplement. There are ve different ap- proaches that I recommend to parents I work with to get their child to take a supple-ment, which I describe below. Read each approach closely and then decide which oneyou feel will work best for your child. Be sure to start slow and be patient. Keep inmind that it won't happen overnight. It typically takes several weeks to get a child totake a supplement at the full dosage. If the approach you select doesn't work for yourchild, please don't give up\u2014try another one. Incorporate Taking the Supplement into Your Child's Behavior Therapy Program Children with autism will often refuse a multivitamin and mineral supplement because of behavioral issues. For instance, your child may refuse to take a supplement and havea tantrum when you offer it to him. Challenging behaviors like this are addressedthrough various treatment approaches. Therapists often use Applied Behavior Analysis(ABA) principles and guidelines to develop an individualized behavior-based programfor an autistic child. Nonfood rewards are used to help reinforce an appropriate behav-ior or teach a new skill. You can include taking a daily supplement without a tantrumor refusal as a new skill to be taught in your child's behavior therapy program. Rewardsand strategies that are already successful with your child can be used to teach this newskill. Discuss this option with your child's behavioral specialist. Many parents I'veworked with over the years have had great success with this approach. The Pill Swallow Cup The Oralflo pill swallow cup is a product that many parents have found very helpful ingetting their child to swallow a capsule, softgel, or tablet. The pill is placed in the spoutof the cup and sits above the beverage in a mesh built into the lid. Your child drinksnaturally from the cup and swallows the pill and beverage together. If you choose thisapproach, discuss it with your child's speech-language pathologist (SLP) before start-ing, especially if he has any problems with oral/motor skills, swallowing, or gagging. The Pill Swallow Program The pill swallow program is designed to teach a child with autism how to swallow acapsule. This is not an actual \"program,\" but a series of steps and strategies I adaptedfrom other feeding and behavioral programs. As a registered dietitian, I don't imple-ment this program myself. Rather I tell parents about this approach and then refer theirchild to a speech-language pathologist, who will actually implement and manage thepill swallow program. 47 STEP 3: CHOOSE A DAILY MULTIVITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENT FOR YOUR CHILD0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 47Step 1: You should consult with your child's SLP to determine if he's old enough and has the oral/motor skills to safely swallow a capsule. If the SLP gives permission, then you can move forward. Step 2: Go to your local pharmacy and buy empty pull-apart capsules in size 4. (Cap- sules come in sizes 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 00; with 4 being the smallest and 00 the largest.) Step 3: The SLP will dedicate a small portion (ve to ten minutes) of her regular speech therapy session each week to the pill swallow program. Using nonfood rein-forcement, the SLP will reward your child as he progresses through each step. The steps include: touch the capsule with one nger; touch the capsule with hand; pick up thecapsule; place the capsule on the hand; touch the capsule to the forehead; touch thecapsule to the cheek, chin, and nose; touch the capsule to the lips; tap the capsule onthe teeth; touch the capsule to the tip of the tongue; lick the capsule; place the capsuleon the tongue; swallow the capsule along with a beverage. Step 4: Once your child has completed the rst three steps with the size 4 capsule, re- peat steps using a size 3 capsule. Step 5: Repeat steps again using a size 2 capsule. It's usually not necessary to progress to the larger size capsules since most dietary supplements are around size 2. I've hadcountless parents request their child's SLP implement this program and most reportback that the SLP had their child successfully swallowing capsules within a few weeks.Once your child has learned to swallow capsules, it becomes easy to administer dietarysupplements as well as medications. Negotiation Negotiation works well with some children, especially those diagnosed with high-functioning autism, Asperger's, PDD, ADD, and ADHD. The level of cooperationyou can expect from your child depends directly on his level of cognitive functioning,temperament, age, and desire to have more control over his environment. To beginthe negotiation, explain to your child that he has to take a multivitamin and mineralsupplement every day, why it's important, and that taking a daily supplement is notnegotiable. Then tell your child that what isnegotiable is how he chooses to take his supplement. Give him several options to choose from, such as the type of supplement(liquid, powder, or capsule) and the means by which he will take the supplement48 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 48 (directly by mouth or mixed in food or a beverage). If you've chosen a custom-made formula for your child, let him pick the flavor. Mix the Supplement into a Food or Beverage Mixing a supplement into a food or beverage is the most common approach parentstry and is usually unsuccessful. Many parents are so anxious to get their child to take avitamin and mineral supplement that they hide the full dosage in his food or beverage;he detects a difference and rejects it. Rather than starting with the full dosage, youshould start with a very small dosage and gradually increase to the full dosage over thespan of three to four weeks, depending on your child's sensitivity to new flavors,smells, and textures. For example, if the supplement instructions indicate your childneeds 1 teaspoon of a liquid each day, the rst week start with 1/16 teaspoon added to a food or beverage four times a day. Your child may detect a slight difference, but notenough to reject it. The second week, increase the dosage to teaspoon four times a day. Week three, increase the dosage to \u00bc teaspoon four times a day. At this point, do not increase anymore without considering your child's sensory issues and whether youthink he will tolerate increasing to teaspoon three times a day. If you go slowly, most children are able to tolerate \u00bdteaspoon twice a day without rejecting the food or beverage. There are several foods and beverages into which you can mix a supplement. When considering to what food or beverage you should add the supplement, be sure it's some-thing your child already knows and likes. This is not the time to introduce somethingnew. Here are some examples of foods and drinks that supplements mix well with:49 STEP 3: CHOOSE A DAILY MULTIVITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENT FOR YOUR CHILD juice milkfruit smoothieRice Dreamyogurtpuddingjuice box (inject liquid supplement into the juice box)peanut butterfruit preserveshoneyketchupcooked foods (after cooking)popsicles (homemade)0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 49Johnnie's Story I received a telephone call from a mother recently. It was a common conversation I've had with countless parents over the years. The mother said to me, \"I started John-nie on his vitamin and mineral supplement a couple of weeks ago like you recom-mended. I'm seeing some improvement; he's less irritable, more focused, andsleeping better at night. Is it possible that the vitamin supplement made a differ-ence?\" My response was, \"Absolutely, yes!\" An observant parent will notice subtlesymptom improvements when her child's marginal nutrient deciencies are correctedwith a basic vitamin and mineral supplement. Johnnie's mother had made many attempts to give Johnnie a vitamin and mineral supplement in the past, but he always rejected it because of severe sensory issues.He refused to eat a chewable supplement. He could detect even the smallest amountof a liquid or powder supplement added to his juice or food. Out of desperation, hisparents even tried crushing up a chewable tablet, mixing it in a liquid, drawing it upinto a syringe, and attempted to squirt the mixture into his mouth. Of course, thismethod caused a huge battle and was quickly discontinued. Since it was such a chal-lenge to get Johnnie to take a supplement, I designed a daily multivitamin and min-eral supplement especially for him. The custom supplement contained 100 percent ofhis RDA for all vitamins and minerals, up to 300 percent of his RDA for the B vita-mins, and 400 mg of calcium (the amount needed to supplement what he was al-ready consuming in his diet to meet 100 percent of his RDA for calcium). I didn'tinclude iron in his supplement because laboratory tests indicated his iron status wasnormal. The supplement was compounded by a pharmacist who added the pre-scribed vitamins and minerals to distilled water and sweetened it slightly with a verysmall amount of stevia. After the pharmacist discussed with Johnnie's mother the fla-vors he accepted, the pharmacist added a natural grape flavor to the liquid supple-ment. Johnnie's mother chose to \"sneak\" the liquid grape-flavored vitamin andmineral supplement into grape juice (grape juice diluted 50 percent with ltered wa-ter). She started with 116of a teaspoon added to 4 ounces of grape juice. Over a period of three weeks she gradually increased the dosage of the liquid vitamin sup-plement to 18, 14, then to 12teaspoons twice per day, which Johnnie accepted in his grape juice without a problem. Johnnie's mother was relieved that she could nallyget him to take a vitamin and mineral supplement consistently every day without astruggle. She was even more amazed at how correcting Johnnie's marginal nutrientdeciencies could have such notable positive effects.50 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 50PROJECT NO. 3: CHOOSE YOUR CHILD'S MULTIVITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENT When deciding which multivitamin and mineral supplement is best for your child, keep in mind the ve criteria: \u0081 The quality. \u0081 It should contain a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals.\u0081 It should provide at least 100 percent of your child's RDA and up to 200-300 percent without exceeding the UL. \u0081 Avoid certain ingredients. \u0081 Buy from a reputable company. DETERMINE IF YOUR CHILD ALSO NEEDS A CALCIUM SUPPLEMENT Add up the total amount of calcium your child consumed over a three-day period. Di- vide the number by three for a daily average and compare your child's calcium intake tohis RDA. (See Appendix 3 for calcium RDA.) Is your child consuming enough cal-cium? If not, add more calcium to your child's diet (see Appendix 2 for sources of cal-cium you could add to his diet). If he still comes up short, you should add a calciumsupplement to make up the difference. Now that your child is taking a supplement every day and critical basic nutrients, vita- mins, and minerals are being replenished in his body, his deciency symptoms will be-gin to diminish. Your child's body and brain function will begin to improve and youcan expect to see subtle improvement in his mood, behavior, and ability to participateand benet from his therapy sessions. The next step is to increase your child's daily in-take of omega-3 fatty acid.51 STEP 3: CHOOSE A DAILY MULTIVITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENT FOR YOUR CHILD0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 51STEP 4 Increase Your Child's Omega-3 Fatty Acid Intake As I mentioned in Step 1, essential fatty acids (EFA) are necessary fats that our bodies can't make and must be obtained through our diet. There are two groups of EFAs:omega-3 and omega-6. The levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids relative to oneanother are critical to the health and development of the brain and body. The optimalratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids in our diet is four to one. Unfortunately, mostAmerican diets provide too many omega-6 and too few omega-3, the typical ratio aver-ages twenty omega-6 to acids. omega-3 acidsin particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)has been linked to autism, dyslexia, attention decient hyperactivity disorder, dys-praxia, depression, and anxiety. Research published in the April 2007 Journal of the Developmental and Behavioral Pe- diatrics supports previous research that indicates that supplementing children's diets with omega-3 fatty acids improves poor learning and behavioral problems. Another re-search article published in 2007 in Biological Psychiatry found that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acids decreased hyperactivity in children with autism spectrum disor-ders. Many other research studies show that supplementing with omega-3 fatty acidsreduces aggression, improves reading and spelling ability, and signicantly improveshyperactivity, inattention, impulsive characteristics, and anxiety as well as cognitiveproblems. In this chapter, we'll focus on how to increase the amount of omega-3 fattyacids your child consumes on a daily basis. THE IMPORTANCE OF EPA AND DHA The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA play a critical role in our bodies. EPA works toincrease blood flow, which influences hormones and the immune system and affects 520738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 52brain function. DHA is the major structural component of the brain. It supports neu- rotransmission among brain cells to provide optimal cognitive functioning, which im-pacts learning and memory. DHA is also a component of the retina of the eye,supporting optimal visual acuity (clearness of vision) and functioning, as well as visionprocessing. DHA is also very important during pregnancy, lactation, and infancy be-cause of the rapid brain development of the fetus, infant, and young child. Both EPAand DHA are converted into hormone-like substances called prostaglandins , which help regulate cell activity and healthy cardiovascular function. Clearly, getting enoughEPA and DHA is very important, especially for children. Unfortunately, the typical child's diet is extremely low in both DHA and EPA. In fact, the average child consumes a mere 19 mg of DHA a day, which is only a fraction of theamount he should be getting. Though children do eat a small amount of the plant-derived omega-3 fatty acid alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) , the body must convert ALA to EPA and DHA to be useful for brain, vision, and body function. The metabolic conver-sion of ALA to EPA and especially to DHA is very low, even in healthy individuals. It's also important to be aware that males are less able than females to make the con- version of ALA to EPA and DHA. Research studies indicate that children diagnosedwith ADHD, dyslexia, and dyspraxia have a compromised ability to convert ALA toEPA and DHA even when they consume an adequate amount of dietary ALA. Re-searchers concluded that this was caused by a deciency of the enzyme delta-6 desat-urase, which plays an integral role in the conversion of ALA to EPA and DHA. It'sbelieved that the best way to get around a possible delta-6 desaturase enzyme deciencyin your child is to provide him with a direct dietary source of EPA and DHA. Thatsaid, it's still important that your child eat foods rich in ALA because they are excellentsources of omega-3 fatty acids. The following charts list the foods that contain ALA,DHA, and EPA so you can begin to incorporate them into your child's diet.

DHA can now be found in a variety of foods, such as infant formula, yogurt, bread,and juice. Eggs are not naturally a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, but now omega-3-enriched eggs, which contain up to 400 mg DHA and EPA, are widely available ingrocery stores. Omega-3 enriched eggs are produced by feeding hens a special diet con-taining ground flaxseed. The actual level of DHA and EPA will vary depending on theflaxseed composition of the chicken feed. Free-range chickens that eat grass and insectsalso produce eggs with higher-than-normal levels of omega-3 fatty acids. Both types ofeggs are good choices for your child. 54 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 54\"When I learned that deciencies of omega-3 fatty acids were linked to dyslexia and attention decient hyperactivity disorder, it caught my attention because my sonCarlos is diagnosed with both these disorders. I was very anxious to add EPA andDHA into Carlos's diet, but he doesn't like to eat sh and I was also concerned aboutthe mercury. I tried to give Carlos cod liver oil, but he refused even the flavored ones. To add omega-3 fatty acids into Carlos's diet more naturally, I changed his milk to organicmilk fortied with DHA and switched from regular eggs to the DHA-enriched eggs. Ialso tried Coromega, which he likes. I feel good that I'm able to provide Carlos withnutrition that is so important for his brain.

Instead, the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board has set levels of Adequate Intake (AI) for ALA. No specic requirements have been setfor DHA and EPA; however the Food and Nutrition Board indicates that up to 10 per-cent of the AI for ALA can be in the form of DHA and EPA combined.

In the autism community, mercury is a heavy metal of specialconcern because it's a neurotoxin that harms the brain and nervous system of unbornbabies and young children. Mercury naturally occurs in the environment and is also re-leased into the air from coal-red power plants and municipal and medical waste incin-erators. The mercury travels for long distances in the air before being deposited intobodies of water such as lakes, streams, and the ocean. Bacteria in these waters transformthe mercury into methylmercury. Fish absorb the methylmercury as they feed in thesewaters and it accumulates within them. Nearly all sh and shellsh have varying levelsof methylmercury, depending on how long they live and how much other sh they eat.Basically, the larger the sh and the longer it's lived, the higher its level of mercury.When a pregnant woman eats sh, she exposes her developing fetus to methylmercury,which poses a threat to its developing brain. Depending on the level of exposure,methylmercury can cause impairment in language, attention, and memory; gait and vi-sual disturbances; effects on neurological development; and mental retardation. TheEPA estimates that 1.16 million women of childbearing age in the United States eatenough mercury-contaminated sh to pose a harmful risk to their future children. Here are the FDA and the EPA's recommendations for choosing and eating sh for women who are or may become pregnant and nursing mothers: \u0081 Do not eat shark, swordsh, king mackerel, and tilesh. \u0081 Eat up to 12 ounces a week of a variety of sh and shellsh that are lower in mercury, such as catsh, salmon, pollock, shrimp, and canned light tuna. \u0081 Limit canned albacore \"white\" tuna to 6 ounces per week due to higher mercury levels. \u0081 Limit tuna steak to 6 ounces per week due to higher mercury levels. \u0081 Check local advisories regarding the safety of sh caught in your local lakes, streams, rivers, and coastal areas. \u0081 If no advisory is available, you may eat up to 6 ounces per week of sh caught from local waters, but don't consume any other sh during that week. There are currently no recommendations regarding the amount of sh considered safe for young children, so the FDA and EPA suggest following the same above recom- mendations, but serve smaller portion sizes. For a complete list of sh and shellsh and57 STEP 4: INCREASE YOUR CHILD'S OMEGA-3 FATTY x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 57their methylmercury levels, you can visit t he FDA Food Safety Web site available at www.cfsan.fda.gov or call them toll-free at (888) SAFEFOOD. You can also get that information from the EPA Web site at www.epa.gov/ost/sh. OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID SUPPLEMENTS Since children diagnosed with autism and other developmental disorders often havesensory issues that contribute to feeding problems, eat a very limited variety of foods,and typically refuse sh, it may not be possible to get enough omega-3 fatty acids intoyour child's diet. If you're worried about mercury-contaminated sh, you may evenchoose to limit or eliminate sh from your family's diet altogether. In this case, yourchild needs to take an omega-3 fatty acid supplement on a daily basis. Omega-3 fatty acid supplements are most commonly made from sh oil and are of- ten referred to as sh oil supplements. When choosing a sh oil supplement for yourchild, keep the following guidelines in mind: \u0081 Mercury and other contaminants can also appear in sh oil supplements, so be sure the supplement you choose is contaminant-free. The International FishOils Standards (IFOS) is the most comprehensive measurement in the sh oil industry for quality and purity. IFOS-certied sh oils are molecularly distilled in a vacuum, which results in virtually no measurable amount of contaminants. \u0081 Look for the USP or NSF seal on the label to assure that the product has passed quality testing. You can also check the ConsumerLab Web site atwww.consumerlab.com. \u0081 As with multivitamin and mineral supplements, there are excellent high-quality sh oil supplements on the market that do not have either the USP or NSF sealon the product label. The manufacturer may choose to have its supplementstested by an outside independent laboratory to verify they're free of contami-nants. If you decide to buy one of these products, be sure it's manufactured by awell-known and reputable company, like Nordic Naturals. They offer a cod liveroil product called DHA Junior that children tolerate well. It's strawberry-flavored and comes in a very small soft gel capsule, which is easy for a child toswallow or chew. Coromega is another sh oil supplement that many childrenaccept. It's a natural orange-flavored pudding product that can be eaten directlyfrom the packet or added to another food your child enjoys. Coromega is alsogreat for kids because it doesn't have a shy odor, taste, or aftertaste. For more58 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 58information, visit Coromega's Web site at www.coromega.com. Both DHA Junior and Coromega are distributed by Kirkman, so you can also go to theirWeb site (www.kirkmangroup.com) for information on these products. \u0081 As a general rule, naturally flavored liquid cod liver oil is a good choice for chil- dren because you need to add only a small amount and it can be easily hidden ina soft food or beverage your child eats.

It ispossible to give your child too much omega-3 fatty acids. Health risks may occur if he consumes more than 3 grams (3,000 mg) of omega-3 fatty acids per day. Accordingto the FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, too much EPA and DHAmay put diabetics at risk for reduced glycemic control, cause hemorrhagic stroke whentaken in very large doses called \"Eskimo amounts,\" suppress immune and inflamma-tion responses, and cause increased bleeding if the individual is also taking aspirin orthe medication Coumadin (warfarin). You may recall from the beginning of this chapter that the levels of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids relative to one another are critical to the health and development ofthe brain and body. As you're increasing the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in yourchild's body, it's important that you also decrease your child's intake of foods high inomega-6 fatty acids. Foods high in omega-6 fatty acids include meats from grain-fedlivestock, liquid vegetable oils (like soybean, sunflower, safflower, and corn oil), andmost prepackaged and highly processed convenience foods. Consuming too muchomega-6 fatty acid is associated with serious health problems, such as heart attack,stroke, arrhythmia, arthritis, osteoporosis, inflammation, mood disorders, and cancer.The omega-6 fatty acid arachidonic acid (ARA) is converted into pro-inflammatoryagents called eicosanoids, which have a negative impact on the body. (Omega-3 fattyacids are also converted to eiscosanoids, but their effects are anti-inflammatory ratherthan pro-inflammatory.) Excess omega-6 fatty acids in our diet also compete for the59 STEP 4: INCREASE YOUR CHILD'S OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID 59same enzyme (delta-6 desaturase) needed to convert ALA to EPA and DHA, which fur- ther increases our risk for omega-3 fatty acid deciencies. An omega-6 fatty acid de-ciency is extremely rare in the United States. In fact, we tend to consume far too muchomega-6 since many of us eat large quantities of grain-fed livestock and vegetable oils.As you increase the amount of omega-3 fatty acids in your child's diet, also make an ef-fort to cut back on foods high in omega-6 fatty acids in order to achieve the ideal fourto one omega-6/omega-3 ratio. PROJECT NO. 4: INCREASE YOUR CHILD'S OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID INTAKE 1. Keep a record of everything your child eats and drinks for seven days. 2. Determine if your child is getting enough DHA and EPA by adding up the total number of milligrams (mg) of combined DHA and EPA your child con- sumed for the seven days and dividing by seven for a daily average. Compareyour child's combined DHA and EPA intake to the recommendations by theFood and Nutrition Board or NIH on page 56. If your child is falling short,rst try increasing his DHA and EPA intake through dietary sources. If that doesn't work, add an omega-3 fatty acid supplement to make up thedifference. Congratulations! Now that you've boosted your child's diet with the proper amount ofomega-3 fatty acids, you've completed the rst four basic steps of this program. You'reready to move into the advanced nutritional interventions. Step 5 will show you how totackle feeding problems associated with problem eaters.60 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_FM.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:26 PM Page 6061STEP 5 Resolve Your Child's Feeding Problem Most parents of autistic children are concerned about what they perceive as their child's \"pickiness\" about food and negative mealtime behaviors. Autistic children tend to havepoor appetites, prefer to drink rather than eat, refuse new foods, accept a very limitedvariety of foods, crave carbohydrates, and have a need for sameness and rituals aroundeating. For many families, mealtime is a battleground where their autistic child gags,throws food, or has a major tantrum, and refuses to eat. Parents try everything fromforced feeding, bribing, and pleading to distracting their child during mealtime withTV and following him around the house offering bites of food throughout the day.Usually none of these techniques work, and parents are left feeling frustrated, over-whelmed, and defeated. Unfortunately, many healthcare practitioners don't understand problem eating and negative mealtime behaviors and are unable to help parents resolve them, which onlyadds to the frustration. Worse yet, parents are often misinformed and told not toworry\u2014their child will \"outgrow his picky eating stage\" or he'll \"eat when he gets hun-gry enough.\" This is not true for kids with feeding problems, and most autistic childrendohave feeding problems as opposed to simply being picky eaters. PICKY EATERS VS.PROBLEM FEEDERS In order to help your child overcome his issues with food, you rst need to determinewhether he's a picky eater or a problem feeder. Characteristics of a Picky Eater Picky eating is a normal part of childhood development. Approximately 50 percent ofchildren aged eighteen to twenty-three months are identied as picky eaters. 0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 61\u0081 eat fewer than thirty foods; \u0081 eat at least one food from almost every type of food texture;\u0081 will eat the same favorite food every day, but will eventually burn out and stop eating the food. Then they'll start eating their favorite food again after about a two-week break; \u0081 tolerate new foods on their plate and are willing to touch or taste the food; \u0081 and are willing to eat a new food after they've been exposed to it ten or more times. Picky eaters tend to consume enough calories and continue to gain weight and grow without any problems. If your child is a picky eater, managing his eating is fairly easy: \u0081 Offer your child a variety of foods each day. \u0081 Make sure he eats his meals and snacks at approximately the same time each day.\u0081 Create a pleasant mealtime environment for him.\u0081 Limit his juice to 4 to 6 ounces per day.\u0081 Limit snacks to two to three per day. These basic strategies are usually all you need to help your picky eater eventually ex- pand his diet to include a wider variety of foods. You can get more detailed information about managing your picky eater from a pediatric registered dietitian. Ellyn Satter, MS,RD, CICSW, BCD\u2014an internationally recognized authority on eating and feeding\u2014has a Web site that contains excellent information on feeding typically developing chil-dren, how to handle picky eaters, and developing healthy eating habits for your entirefamily. You can visit her site at www.ellynsatter.com. (Please note: If you've determinedthat your child doesn't have a feeding problem, you can move ahead to Step 6, HealYour Child's Gut.) Characteristics of Problem Feeders Problem feeding is not a normal part of childhood development and is much morecomplicated than picky eating. Problem feeders tend to eat a very poor diet, may havevitamin and mineral deciencies, consume inadequate amounts of calories and protein,and their problems may be severe enough to interfere with normal weight gain andgrowth. Problem feeders \u0081 eat fewer than twenty foods; \u0081 eat fewer foods over time until they accept only ve to ten foods;62 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 62\u0081 refuse to eat foods from entire categories of texture; \u0081 will eat the same favorite food every day, but will burn out and stop eating the food\u2014unlike picky eaters, they won't eat the food again after a two-week break; \u0081 won't tolerate a new food on their plate and are unwilling to even touch or taste the food; \u0081 cry and/or throw a tantrum when offered a new food;\u0081 have a need for sameness and rituals around mealtime;\u0081 are very inflexible about particular foods (for example, they will eat only McDonald's French fries, not Wendy's); \u0081 and are still unwilling to eat a new food after the typical ten exposures. If your child has a feeding problem, he will need long-term, extensive feeding ther- apy from a multidisciplinary feeding team to help resolve his feeding issues. THE CAUSES OF FEEDING PROBLEMS Once you've determined that your child is a problem feeder, the next step is to gure out why. The only effective way to treat his feeding problem is to identify every singlecontributing factor to the problem. However, this is easier said than done. There aremany possible causes, or combinations of causes, for your child's feeding problem, suchas the following: \u0081 medical conditions \u0081 sensory integration dysfunction nutritional problems \u0081 environmental factors \u0081 oral-motor dysfunction \u0081 and behavioral problems This is where the feeding team comes in. A group of specialists\u2014which includes a physician, registered dietitian, speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist, and behavioral specialist\u2014will work together to identify the causes of your child's feedingproblem and create an individualized treatment program to help him overcome it. A\"team\" is required because feeding problems are so complex, and each medical profes-sional has a unique role to play in helping your child resolve his problem. The physicianis responsible for identifying and treating any medical issues that may be contributing tohis feeding problem. Each of the other therapists will conduct their own evaluation ofyour child to assess his feeding. Based on the results of their evaluations, the team willdevelop a Feeding Intervention Plan for your child. The plan will explain in detail:63 STEP 5: RESOLVE YOUR CHILD'S FEEDING PROBLEMS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 63\u0081 the factors contributing to your child's feeding problem, \u0081 the strategies that will be used to address each of the contributing factors,\u0081 specic feeding treatment approaches they will use,\u0081 how often and with which specialist your child will have feeding therapy sessions, \u0081 the goals for treatment and how progress will be measured,\u0081 and how the feeding team members will communicate information to one another and to you. As I describe the causes of feeding problems below, you'll see just how each feeding team member ts in to the process. Medical Conditions The rst step is to have your child's physician examine him for any underlying medical conditions that could be interfering with his ability to eat. Gastrointestinal problems,such as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD), Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal Dis-orders (EGID), and chronic constipation are some of the leading contributing factorsto feeding problems. These conditions make eating physically painful for your child,and eventually he learns to avoid the pain by refusing to eat. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease is a condition where acid in the stomach backs up into the esophagus, causing it to become inflamed (esophagitis ) and resulting in a burning sensation in the chest. GERD often occurs when the lower esophagealsphincter (the valve separating the esophagus and stomach) doesn't close properly, al- lowing acid to back up into the esophagus. Even after GERD has been identied andtreated, some children still to refuse to eat because they continue to associate eatingwith physical pain. Beware of Aspiration Some children with GERD also experience aspiration, which is when they inhale the contents of their stomachs into their lungs. Aspiration often causes coughing and choking, but sometimes there are no symptoms. Aspiration is dangerous because itcan cause infection in the lungs (like pneumonia), and it can also damage the liningof the lungs.64 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 64Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders are a chronic and complex group of disorders characterized by having excessive amounts of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in one or more specic places in the digestive system. For instance, if your child has Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EE) , he has high amounts of eosinophils his esophagus. If he has Eosinophilic Gastroenteritis (EG) , his stomach and small intestines are affected; and if he has Eosinophilic Colitis (EC) , the problem is in his colon. The symptoms of eosinophilic gastroenteritis disorder (EGID) vary widely, depending on the area affected,and can mimic the symptoms of other diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, food al-lergies, irritable bowel syndrome, and GERD. (EE in particular is commonly misdiag-nosed as GERD.) The most common symptoms of EGID include the following: \u0081 nausea or vomiting \u0081 diarrhea\u0081 failure to thrive (poor growth or weight loss)\u0081 abdominal or chest pain\u0081 reflux that does not respond to usual therapy\u0081 dysphagia (difculty swallowing)\u0081 food impactions (food gets stuck in (delayed emptying of the stomach)\u0081 blood in the stool\u0081 malnutrition\u0081 difculty sleeping If your child has EGID, it can cause him signicant pain, which can result in severe feeding problems. EGID can be diagnosed only through an upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, and biopsy. Once the presence of EE, EG, and/or EC is conrmed, food allergy testing is typically ordered by the gastroenterologist. Since reactions to foods can't always be identied with food allergy testing, your child will also be put on anelimination/challenge diet to help identify problematic foods. The foods that are mostlikely causing your child's problem, such as cow's milk, soy, eggs, wheat, peanuts, nuts,sh, and shellsh will be eliminated from his diet rst. Then they'll be reintroducedone at a time to test your child's tolerance.65 STEP 5: RESOLVE YOUR CHILD'S FEEDING PROBLEMS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 65Chronic constipation is typically described as infrequent, hard, and painful bowel movements. Common symptoms include abdominal cramps and pain, bloating, nau- sea, vomiting, irritability, behavioral problems, poor appetite, and food refusal.Chronic constipation can cause some children to develop megacolon (large intestines gets stretched out of shape), which causes them to pass very large bowel movements.These large bowel movements can result in anal ssures (tears at the anal opening), which are extremely painful. Chronic constipation can also lead to encopresis, or theleakage of stool. Encopresis occurs when the large intestine get stretched to the pointwhere liquid stool leaks around the more formed stool in the colon and passes throughthe anus into the child's underwear. If your child has chronic constipation, the pain as-sociated with bowel movements may cause him to refuse to go to the toilet or hold inhis stool. Parents of chronically constipated kids often describe them as grazers who eatsmall amounts of food throughout the day rather than sitting down to eat a meal.When they do sit down to eat a meal, they tend to eat just a few bites and complainthey're full. If your child's physician suspects he has a gastrointestinal condition, he will likely re- fer him to a pediatric gastroenterologist for further assessment. The gastroenterologistmay need to administer one or more tests to help identify your child's gastrointestinalproblem, such as an upper GI X-ray, a gastric-emptying study, an upper GI en-doscopy, or a pH probe. It's also important that your child be seen by a registered dietitian. She can assess whether there are dietary factors contributing to his gastrointestinal problems, such aslack of fluid and ber intake, medication effects, problematic foods, excess juice intake,and nutrient deciencies. (T urn to Step 6 for a more in-depth look at gastrointestinalproblems in children on the autism spectrum.) Food Allergies, Sensitivities, and Intolerances If your child suffers from a food allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance, it may cause him tohave several intestinal symptoms, such as reflux, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, ab-dominal distension, gaseousness, loose stools, diarrhea, and chronic constipation. Nat-urally, these symptoms will make your child feel very uncomfortable, and he'll learnthat eating makes him feel bad. Your child may often refuse food, gradually limit thenumber of foods he's willing to eat, and have tantrums and behavioral problems atmealtime. Be sure to rule out food allergies, sensitivities, and intolerances as a possiblecontributing factor to your child's feeding problem. (Step 7 discusses in detail how youcan identify a problematic food and the appropriate nutritional treatment.)66 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 66Medication Side Effects Many children with autism and related disorders take medication to treat issues like de- pression, obsessive compulsivity, aggression, tantrums, hyperactivity, and attention can cause side effects thatcontribute to a feeding problem. Common side effects include the following: \u0081 decreased or increased appetite \u0081 altered taste \u0081 decreased or increased weight \u0081 abdominal pain\u0081 nausea \u0081 loose stools \u0081 vomiting \u0081 diarrhea \u0081 dry mouth \u0081 constipation Your child may also have other conditions that are being treated with medication, such as a sleep disorder, seizures, allergies, or digestive problems. If your child is taking one or more medications, you should have a registered dietitian review the potentialside effects and assess whether they're contributing to his feeding problem. Keep inmind that your child should never stop taking a prescribed medication without rstdiscussing it with his physician. Previous Invasive Interventions Some children who've had an invasive procedure performed around the mouth, such asintubation, tracheostomy, or a nasogastric feeding tube, have ongoing feeding prob-lems for months, and even years, after the tubes have been removed. This can happenwhen a child is physically unable to eat for an extended period of time and misses thecritical developmental stage necessary to build a foundation for feeding skills and nor-mal eating behaviors. It can also occur when a child is traumatized by an invasive pro-cedure and develops a fear of putting things, including food, into his mouth. Dental Problems Dental issues such as caries , sore or swollen gums, and mouth sores can contribute to a feeding problem. Your child may limit his diet to soft, smooth foods and refusecrunchy, spicy, or hot foods. Have his dentist rule out dental issues, and be sure yourchild is going for regular check-ups and cleanings.67 STEP 5: RESOLVE YOUR CHILD'S FEEDING PROBLEMS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 67Nutritional Problems Nutritional problems are a common but often overlooked contributing factor to feed- ing problems. Many times, these problems can be relatively easy to x. For instance, ifyour child is drinking too much juice, it can ll up his stomach and make him feel fullat mealtimes, preventing him from eating solid foods. Children should have only 4 to 6ounces of juice per day, but many children drink much more than that. I know kidswho sip juice throughout the day and take in as much as 32 to 48 ounces per day. Ifyour child is drinking an excess amount of juice, you should gradually decrease the to-tal amount to no more than one cup per day. You may nd that this not only improvesyour child's appetite but also his loose stools. Nutrient Deficiencies You may remember from Step 3 that a common symptom of vitamin and mineral de-ciencies is loss of appetite. This is particularly true of a zinc deciency. Deciencies ofother vitamins and minerals can have global symptoms, such as irritability, mood andbehavior changes, decreased attention, and lethargy, which can interfere with yourchild's ability to sit down at the table and eat a well-balanced meal. It's a vicious cycle:A poor diet causes nutrient deciencies, which in turn leads to poor appetite, which re-sults in food refusal and mealtime behavior problems. T urn to Step 3 for a refresher onimproving your child's diet with a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement. A regis-tered dietitian can assess your child's diet to determine specic vitamin and mineral de-ciencies and recommend appropriate supplements. Oral-Motor Dysfunction Your child may have an oral-motor skill problem, such as difculty sucking, biting,chewing, swallowing, or coordinating tongue movements, which interferes with hisability to eat and to handle foods of certain textures and consistencies. A speech andlanguage pathologist (SLP) can evaluate your child's oral-motor function, identify de-lays and problems, and then guide him through therapeutic activities that will improvehis feeding skills. The SLP may have your child undergo an X-ray procedure called avideo fluoroscopic swallow study (also known as a modied barium swallow study ) to determine whether he's able to swallow safely without aspirating food or liquid intohis lungs. It's very important that your child be assessed by a SLP before starting a feed-ing therapy program. This serves two purposes: You'll be able to rule out or identifyand treat any oral-motor problems, and you'll also reduce your child's risk for aspira-tion and choking.68 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 68Sensory Integration Dysfunction One of the leading contributors to feeding problems among autistic children is sensory integration dysfunction, also known as sensory processing disorder. Children withsensory integration dysfunction experience a disruption of the intake and organizationof sensory information within the brain. This causes them to have trouble respondingappropriately to sensory information from their environment. Sensory processing dys-function affects children in every facet of their lives, including eating. Eating is a com-plex act that requires all ve of our senses: visual, tactile (touch), smell, taste, andauditory (hearing). Your child must be able to simultaneously integrate all ve of hissenses during the eating process. If he has sensory integration dysfunction, he likely hasa tough time touching, let alone eating, food. He may be hypersensitive to the texture,smell, and temperature of foods and become easily overwhelmed during mealtime, trig-gering a tantrum and food refusal. Your child may also overreact to noises and be un-able to eat at mealtime when family members are talking at the dinner table.Conversely, your child may be hyposensitive and is not sensitive enough to sensory in- formation. This would prompt him to seek out constant stimulation or more intensesensory experiences. Hyposensitive children often stuff their mouths full of food,pocket food in the sides of their mouths, and swallow the food later or spit it out. Here are some common mealtime responses you may have seen from your child if he has sensory issues: Visual. Your child may prefer foods of a certain color and reject foods of any other color. He may have a tantrum if foods touch each other on his plate. Serving sizes that are toolarge may visually overwhelm your child and he may totally refuse to eat anything. Tactile. If your child is hypersensitive, he may be unwilling to touch foods with his hands. (Exploring foods with his hands is a critical step to becoming familiar with anew food, putting it in his mouth, and learning to successfully eat it.) He likely rejectsnew foods, and gags, chokes, or vomits, which reinforces his fear of certain foods. Smell. If your child is hypersensitive to smells, he may become fussy and eventually to- tally overwhelmed by the odors of food preparation and cooking before mealtime evenbegins. He may gag or vomit when the food is offered at mealtime. Taste. Strong flavors can trigger the gag reflex in children with taste hypersensitivity. Your child may have very strong taste preferences and prefer bland foods or specic flavors.69 STEP 5: RESOLVE YOUR CHILD'S FEEDING PROBLEMS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 69Auditory. For children who are hypersensitive to sound, eating food itself can create sounds that are overwhelming. Your child may prefer soft foods and liquids to avoid the sounds created by hard, crunchy foods. People talking at the table, sounds in theenvironment, television, and other sounds during mealtime may distract your childand he may be unable to eat. If your child is hyposensitive to sensory input, he may seem oblivious during meal- times, even in noisy environments. He may have trouble differentiating between differ-ent tastes, textures, temperatures, and smells of food. He may also have troubleidentifying when he's full, which can lead to portion control issues. An occupational therapist (OT) can evaluate your child's ability to process sensory information, assess if he has a sensory integration dysfunction, and identify how itimpacts his ability to eat. The OT plays a major role in developing a feeding therapyprogram, providing therapy, and improving your child's tolerance level to sensory input. Environmental Factors Your child's mealtime environment plays an important role in his ability to eat. Distractions. Distractions during mealtime can over-stimulate your child; he may be- come overwhelmed from the sensory overload, lose focus, and lose interest in eating. Besure to keep distractions at mealtime to a minimum by limiting noise and turning offthe television set. Grazing. If your child picks at food all day long and never sits down for a real meal, he'll lose his internal biorhythm of feeling hungry and full. He won't develop normalhunger cues and won't have the desire to sit down and eat a meal or healthy snack. Lack of routine. Children should have a structured schedule that includes three meals and two to three snacks every day. Otherwise, they can't fall into a comfortable patternof expecting meals and snacks. Offer your child his meals and snacks at a designatedplace where he's expected to sit in a chair at a table. Consistency, structure, and routinedeveloped around meals and snacks will promote a healthy appetite and improved eating. Mealtime dynamics. Your interaction with your child at mealtime may also play a role in his feeding problem. For instance, trying to coerce, trick, or bribe your child to tastea food will lead to struggles between you that will only worsen his problem.70 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 70Improper physical environment. Where your child sits, his chair, his posture during mealtime, and the utensils he uses all need to be assessed to make sure they meet his needs. For instance, your child's utensils may not be age-appropriate. Or he may need amore supportive chair to facilitate eating. I encourage you to have one of your child's therapists and/or a behavioral therapist come to your home and observe a mealtime. This is the best way to identify any envi-ronment factors that need to be addressed and come up with strategies to resolve themthat can be included in your child's feeding therapy. Behavioral Problems Your child's behavior toward food and at mealtimes is the nal piece in the feedingproblem puzzle. It's very important to pay attention to your child's negative mealtimebehaviors because he's trying to tell you something. If you learn to interpret his behav-iors, you'll be able to gure out where the feeding process is breaking down for him.Common negative mealtime behaviors include the following: \u0081 refusing to come to the table \u0081 not sitting still in his chair and continually leaving the table\u0081 refusing to eat\u0081 throwing food\u0081 crying when presented with food\u0081 throwing tantrums\u0081 gagging and/or vomiting\u0081 spitting out food\u0081 disrupting others who are trying to eat As you now know, many of these behaviors could be caused by medical condi- tions, nutritional problems, oral-motor dysfunction, sensory integration dysfunc- tion, and environmental factors. Once all of the issues I've discussed in this chapterhave been ruled out or identified and addressed in your child's treatment program,you may find that his behaviors at mealtime improve significantly. However, thesenegative responses may be so entrenched in your child's mealtime routine that hecontinues them even after the root prob lem has been resolved. I strongly recom- mend that you have your child assessed by a behavioral specialist. The behavioralspecialist will conduct a behavioral functional assessment, which will help determinewhat triggers specific behaviors at mealtime, and develop strategies for you to handle71 STEP 5: RESOLVE YOUR CHILD'S FEEDING PROBLEMS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 71your child's behavior. He can also advise the other therapists on your child's feeding team on how to best handle your child's behavior problems and offer insight on hisfeeding intervention plan. Tyler's Story Tyler was a twenty-seven-month-old diagnosed with PDD-NOS. He was also a twin who had been born two months premature. His parents told me he was nonverbal,avoided contact with other people, had severe \"meltdowns,\" and often spun aroundin circles. He had been receiving speech therapy once a week through an Early Inter-vention program and had an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) in place. Tyler's parents described him as a very picky eater. In reality, Tyler had a severe feeding problem. He only ate Stage 2 baby foods (sweet potato, pears, and veg-etable/chicken), chocolate-flavored soy milk, water, and GFCF potato chips, andhad never transitioned to regular table foods. He once tried to eat shredded chickenbut spit it out after he chewed it. Tyler did not express hunger, refused to try newfoods, refused baby foods he used to eat, and resisted going to the table at meal-time. On the other hand, Tyler's twin brother had transitioned to regular table foodswithout a problem and was eating a wide variety of foods. In an attempt to get Tylerto eat, he was allowed to \"graze\" on foods and sip chocolate-flavored soy milk froma sippy cup all day long. His mother said that the only way she could get Tyler to eatat all was to sit him in front of the television and distract him during mealtime. Hisparents were very frustrated and simply didn't know what else to do. Tyler was notreceiving any type of therapy to address his feeding problem. To start, I sent a letter to Tyler's physician explaining that I suspected Tyler was not a picky eater, but rather he had a severe feeding problem that required an evalua-tion and feeding therapy by a multidisciplinary feeding team. Tyler was then referredto a pediatric gastroenterologist to rule out any medical conditions that may be con-tributing to his feeding problem, especially since as an infant he had a history of reflux, projectile vomiting, and required an amino acid-based infant formula. Tyler was also evaluated by the occupational therapist with the early intervention programto determine if his sensory integration processes were impacting his feeding. Hisspeech language pathologist expanded on her speech evaluation to assess his oral-motor and swallow skills related to feeding. I also suggested a referral to a behav-ioral specialist who could evaluate Tyler's behavior and interactions with his parentsduring mealtime.72 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 72Following my recommendation, Tyler's mother requested an IFSP meeting, where she asked that feeding therapy be included in Tyler's IFSP. It was designated that the speech language pathologist would provide two feeding therapy sessions a week.The speech language pathologist wanted to do this, but didn't feel she had adequatetraining in the area of feeding therapy. After additional negotiation, the early inter-vention program agreed to send the speech language pathologist to Dr. Toomey'stwo-day seminar to learn the SOS approach to feeding. She returned from the in-tense comprehensive training prepared and excited to get started with Tyler. To-gether, the entire feeding team\u2014Tyler's parents, the speech language pathologist,occupational therapist, behavioral specialist, and the registered dietitian\u2014developeda feeding intervention plan and wrote feeding outcomes and objectives that were in-cluded in Tyler's IFSP. Tyler began his twice weekly feeding sessions and within justeight weeks, signicant improvements were made. Tyler accepted six solid foods:GFCF cookies, crackers, and bread, rice cakes, peanut butter, and bacon. After several more weeks, his diet expanded even more to include vegetables, fruit, and meat. With the entire feeding team working together, Tyler accomplished the goal ofeating a developmentally age-appropriate meal, sitting in a chair at the table, andusing age-appropriate utensils to feed himself. Tyler's mother did an outstanding job of pulling together a feeding team with the cooperation of the Early Intervention program. She strongly and successfully advo-cated for her son and received services that were not traditionally provided by thatparticular program. Tyler's mom told me that it was a very hard task to accomplishand extremely frustrating at times, but she was determined not to give up. She said,\"Every minute was worth it when my husband and I can sit down at the dinner tableand enjoy a normal meal with both our boys.\" INDEPENDENT FEEDING THERAPY PROGRAMS There's very little research available on effective therapy to treat feeding problems among young children with autism, and even less information on working with olderchildren. However, there are a few step-by-step feeding therapy programs that havebeen quite successful with autistic children. Cheri Fraker, CCC-SLP , has created aprogram called Food Chaining , which is based on the idea that there are specic rea- sons why your child will eat only certain foods. Your child may nd these foods ac-ceptable because of their color, texture, flavor, or even visual appearance. Foodchaining determines why your child accepts certain foods, and then shows you how to73 STEP 5: RESOLVE YOUR CHILD'S FEEDING PROBLEMS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 73expand his food repertoire by introducing new foods that have the same features as the ones he currently eats. After your child has expanded his diet with this method, newfoods with slightly different features are introduced. You can nd a complete descrip-tion of this method in Food Chaining: The Proven 6-Step Plan to Stop Picky Eating, Solve Feeding Problems, and Expand Your Child's Diet, by Cheri Fraker, Laura Walbert, Sibyl Cox, and Mark Fishbein. Another feeding therapy program that has proven effective is the Sequential Oral Sen- sory (SOS) Approach to Feeding, which was developed by pediatric psychologist Dr. KayToomey. The SOS approach is a thirty-two-step plan designed to ease your child into tol-erating, interacting, smelling, touching, tasting, and eating a new food. Dr. Toomey offersadvanced courses to train therapists in the SOS approach in Denver, Colorado. If you're considering trying either one of these treatment approaches, be sure to dis- cuss it with your child's feeding team rst. FINDING A FEEDING TEAM Many hospitals, medical facilities, and private clinics in large cities have feeding teamsalready in place. However, if you don't live in or near a large city, this may not be agood option for you. Feeding therapy is intensive and can last for months, and it's un-realistic for you to drive back and forth long distances for feeding therapy sessions foran extended period of time. If you live in a smaller town or a rural area, chances are youwon't nd an already-assembled feeding team in your community. This means you'regoing to have to put one together on your own. Before you panic at the thought, let meassure you that assembling a feeding team for your child is not as hard as you mightthink. The following steps will help you get started: 1. Start by looking at the therapists who are already treating your child's autism. Do any of them have experience with feeding problems? If so, talk to themabout becoming part of your child's feeding team. 2. Ask your child's physician for referrals to a speech-language pathologist, occu- pational therapist, registered dietitian, and behavioral specialist. 3. Set up a time to talk with each of the referrals. You want to get to know them a bit, as it's important for you and your child to feel comfortable with everyoneon the feeding team, and you should also nd out if they have experience withautism and feeding problems.74 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 744. Once you have selected the members of your child's feeding team, schedule an appointment with each of the therapists for a comprehensive assessment. 5. Ask the feeding team to develop a Feeding Intervention Plan for your child. Putting together your child's feeding team will take some work, but it's the only way you're going to be able to resolve his feeding problem and expand his diet. In the end, I know you'll nd that it's well worth the effort. AT-HOME STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE YOUR CHILD'S FEEDING PROBLEM It's going to take some time to locate or assemble a feeding team, have your child eval-uated, develop a feeding intervention plan, and start feeding therapy sessions. In themeantime, here are some very basic strategies you can use to improve your child's feed-ing problem. Use positive reinforcement. Praise your child when he does something appropriate at mealtime, and do your best to ignore his negative behaviors. Do the same with yourchild's siblings to help reinforce the point. Keep mealtime positive, pleasant, and en-joyable. Use social modeling. Even if your child refuses to eat, have him sit at the dinner table with the rest of the family at mealtime. You and your child's siblings should modelgood eating and social behavior and avoid making negative comments and faces atfoods. Your child should not be the focus of the mealtime. Limit his juice. Don't allow your child to drink more than one cup of juice per day. Don't let him graze. Your child shouldn't be nibbling on small amounts of food all day long. Offer him three meals and two to three small snacks per day. Offer him water be-tween meals and snacks. Stick to a schedule. Your child's meals and snacks should be approximately two and a half to three hours apart and offered at approximately the same time and at the sameplace in your home every day. He needs to learn that there's a consistent daily routinefor meals and snacks. Meals should be limited to no more than thirty minutes andsnacks to fteen minutes.75 STEP 5: RESOLVE YOUR CHILD'S FEEDING PROBLEMS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 75Limit distractions during mealtime. T urn off the television during meals, and keep the ambient noise level down to avoid auditory over-stimulation. Offer manageable foods. Present foods on your child's plate in small, easily chewable bites. There should be no more than three different foods on his plate at any one time. Give your child smaller-than-normal serving sizes to avoid visual over-stimulation. Get your child involved. Make your child a part of menu planning, grocery shopping, food preparation, and setting the table for meals. He's more likely to eat a food if he'shad some sort of interaction with it prior to mealtime. Use appropriate mealtime language. Don't ask your child a question or make a de- mand to which he can respond with a \"no.\" This will lead to a power struggle betweenyou. Avoid \"can you?\" questions and \"don't\" demands. Instead, speak to your child us-ing positive statements, such as \"you can\" and \"do.\" Here are some examples: Instead of saying \"Suzie, can you take a bite of peas for Momma?\" say, \"Suzie eats peas with her spoon.\" Instead of saying \"Suzie, please can you drink some milk for Daddy?\" say, \"Suzie sips milk from her cup.\" Instead of saying \"Don't throw your cup!\" say, \"Cups are for drinking. Your cup goes here until you're ready to take a sip.\" Instead of saying \"Don't put so many crackers in your mouth at a time! You're going to choke!\" say, \"Johnnie chews one cracker at a time.\" Avoid food burnout. If your child eats the same food, the same way, every day, he'll eventually \"burn out\" and eliminate the food from his diet. Once an autistic child witha feeding problem eliminates a preferred food, he usually won't accept it again in thefuture. If your child continues to burn out on his preferred foods, he'll soon be left witha very few foods in his diet. To avoid burnout, offer a particular food no more thanevery other day; and if your child has a very limited food repertoire, and you have nochoice but to offer a particular food daily, change one thing about the color, shape, tex-ture, or taste of the food. The change should be very slight\u2014your child should notice adifference but not enough to cause him to reject the food. Even a difference this slightcan be enough to prevent food burnout. Here's an example: Suzie eats a pancake every day, but her diet is limited to three foods, so her mom has to offer them every day and avoid burnout at the same time.76 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 76Monday: Mom should serve the pancake as usual. Tuesday: Mom should change the shape; for instance, make it oblong instead of perfectly round. Wednesday: Mom should change the taste; for instance, add two eggs to the batterinstead of one. Thursday: Mom should change the texture; for instance, add a very small amountof ber powder to the batter. Friday: Mom should change the color; for instance, add a small amount offruit preserve to the batter. Saturday: Mom should change the shape of the butter on the pancake. Sunday: Mom should change the color of the syrup; for instance, make itdarker or lighter. These basic strategies will help you get started improving your child's eating behav- iors and hopefully prevent them from getting worse while you wait for his feeding ther-apy to begin. PROJECT NO. 5: DETERMINE WHETHER YOUR CHILD IS A PICKY EATER OR A PROBLEM FEEDER 1. Consult the list of characteristics for picky eaters and problem feeders on pages 61 -63. If your child demonstrates characteristics of a picky eater, see a regis- tered dietitian for strategies to handle picking eating. 2. If your child demonstrates characteristics of a problem feeder, take him to his physician for a complete medical exam and ask if he can refer you to a feedingteam. 3. If your child's physician can't refer you to a feeding team, assemble the team yourself by consulting with your child's current therapists and/or getting indi-vidual referrals from your child's physician (see page 74 for tips on putting to-gether a feeding team on your own). 4. Start implementing the at-home feeding strategies to help improve your child's feeding.77 STEP 5: RESOLVE YOUR CHILD'S FEEDING PROBLEMS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 77My hope is that you come away from this chapter with an understanding of how im- portant it is to address and resolve your child's feeding problem. You can't take a \"waitand see\" approach and hope your child's feeding problem improves on its own. It won't.In fact, it will only worsen over time. The sooner you take action, the better. It's alsoimportant to recognize that you cannot solve your child's feeding problem on your own. Feeding problems are very complex, and your child must be treated by a team ofprofessionals. It's true that Step 5 is time-consuming, and it will take weeks or evenmonths to achieve. But watching your child's diet expand, and seeing him eat a varietyof healthy foods, probably for the very rst time, is a wonderful reward for all yourtime, effort, and hard work.78 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 78STEP 6 Heal Your Child's Gut Gastrointestinal problems involving the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon are very common among children with autism. In fact, recent research shows that GIproblems are more prevalent in autistic kids than other children, a notion that themedical community had long dismissed as improbable. In a study published in theJournal of the Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics in 2006, 70 percent of autistic children were found to have a lifetime history of gastrointestinal symptoms such as ab-normal stools, constipation, frequent vomiting, and abdominal pain. Other researchstudies indicate that children with autism have high well as low levels of intestinal carbohydrate digestive enzymes. The symptoms of gastrointestinal problems,which range from mild to severe, can have a major impact on both your child's healthand his behavior. If your child suffers from one or more of the symptoms listed below,a gastrointestinal disorder may be the If your child is indeed suffering from a gastrointestinal disorder, effective treatment will resolve his symptoms, which in turn should improve some of his behaviors. We don't know exactly why such a large percentage of autistic children suffer from gastrointestinal disorders, but there are countless theories. Some believe that autistic children suffer from leaky gut syndrome (increased intestinal permeabil- ity); others think that it's due to an imbalance of microflora in the gastrointestinaltract (specifically, the overgrowth of Candida albican yeast). Some believe an 790738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 79 autoimmune disease is to blame, and still others think it's caused by IgG food sensi- tivities or carbohydrate digestive enzyme deficiencies. There's also talk about a newvariant form of inflammatory bowel disease called autistic entercolitis , which was first reported by gastroenterologist Dr. Andrew Wakefield and is very controversial.In the end, it doesn't really matter why your child is more prone to GI problems; what matters is identifying and healing the problem. ELIMINATION PROBLEMS The most common complaints children with autism seem to have when it comes to GIproblems is chronic constipation, chronic diarrhea, and loose or nonformed stools. Re-search conrms that constipation is more common in children with autism than otherchildren. Abdominal X-rays of children with and without autism who are experiencingstomach pain have shown that autistic children have a signicantly higher rate of excessstool in the colon. Children with chronic constipation often associate bowel move-ments with pain and deliberately hold in their stool to avoid a bowel movement. Hold-ing in their stool causes them to lose the urge to have a bowel movement, whichcompletes the vicious cycle that is chronic constipation. If your child is experiencingchronic constipation, he's at the very least uncomfortable and may well be in pain. Asyou may remember from my discussion of chronic constipation in Step 5 (see page 66),it can result in physical issues such as megacolon and encopresis and behavioral issuesthat contribute to feeding problems. To help you assess whether your child may be constipated, the chart below shows the average number of bowel movements you should expect from your child throughouthis childhood years. If he's falling short within his age group, talk to his physician. Age Number of Bowel Movements per Day per Week 0-3 months breastfed 2.9 5-40 formula fed 2.0 5-28 6-12 months 1.8 5-28 1-3 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 80On the other end of the spectrum, autistic children also tend to have problems with chronic diarrhea, loose stools, nonformed stools, or a combination of all three at differ- ent times. Many parents describe their child as never having had a normally formedstool. Chronic diarrhea is diarrhea that's present for more than three weeks and is not as-sociated with an illness. Many medical professionals refer to it as chronic nonspecic di-arrhea (CNSD). If a child with CNSD continues to gain weight and grow taller at anormal rate, many medical professionals don't consider it a signicant health problem orsuggest any specic medical treatment to resolve the issue. Parents, however, are usuallyvery concerned about their child's abnormal stools and rightly so. If your child is havingdifculty controlling his bowel function, it will impact him in many ways. For instance,having chronic diarrhea, loose stools, and/or nonformed stools will affect his ability topotty train, forcing you and other caregivers to continue changing diapers beyond thetypical age. Your child's bowel function issues may make him feel uncomfortable andself-conscious, which will affect his sensory system and can lead to behavioral problems.He may also encounter nutritional deciencies because chronic diarrhea causes malab-sorption of vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids, and other nutrients. This impedeshis body's ability to repair the lining of the GI tract, which serves only to exacerbate hismalabsorption of nutrients. This vicious cycle of chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, andnutrient deciencies can compromise your child's overall health, brain function, and behavior. THE GI DISORDER\u2014BEHAVIOR CONNECTION Undiagnosed GI disorders can cause serious behavioral problems in autistic children,particularly those who are unable to verbally express the pain they're feeling. If yourchild is nonverbal, the only way he can communicate how he feels is through his be-havior. Some common behaviors that may indicate your child has a GI disorder are thefollowing: \u0081 food refusal \u0081 mealtime tantrums \u0081 self abuse \u0081 accepting a limited \u0081 irritability variety of foods Unfortunately, too often these symptoms are dismissed \"typical\" autistic behaviors as opposed to attempts to communicate what can't be put into words. Identifying andcorrecting your child's GI disorder will lead to signicant improvement in the way hebehaves.81 STEP 6: HEAL YOUR CHILD'S GUT0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 81Sara's Story Eight-year-old Sara was diagnosed with autism; she was nonverbal and had severe behavioral problems, including self abuse. Sara's mother informed her speech andlanguage therapist that Sara was a picky eater (she was really a problem eater asshe ate only three foods) and had severe behavioral problems at mealtime, such asthrowing food, crying, tantrums, and biting herself. Since Sara was nonverbal, therst thing the SLP did in speech therapy was to teach Sara to use colors as a way toexpress herself. Each color represented a feeling; for example, the color red meantmad, angry, pain, or hurt. After Sara learned the colors, the SLP encouraged her todraw a picture. Sara took a crayon and drew a stick gure of a person. Then shepicked up the red crayon and drew a red ball in the stomach area and a red line up to the center of the chest area of the stick gure. The SLP shared the picture withSara's parents, who took her to a pediatric gastroenterologist. The GI specialistperformed several studies, including an upper GI endoscopy, and discovered Sarawas suffering from GERD with severe esophagitis. Sara had probably been sufferingfrom undiagnosed GERD and esophagitis for years, experiencing severe pain aftermealtime but unable to verbally express how she felt. Sara's behavior at mealtimewas her way of communicating her pain, but instead everyone thought she wasmerely having typical autistic behavioral problems. CONTRIBUTING FACTORS The factors that contribute to gastrointestinal problems can be split into two cate- gories: dietary and physical. If your child is expressing one or more of the GI symptomslisted on page 79, you need to gure out what specic factors are contributing to hissymptoms. Then you'll be able to determine the medical and dietary treatments thatare right for him. Common contributing factors include the following: \u0081 inadequate water intake \u0081 inadequate dietary ber intake\u0081 low muscle tone ( hypotonia ) or increased muscle ( hypertonia) \u0081 decreased physical activity\u0081 irregular toilet habits\u0081 unable to communicate the need to have a bowel movement82 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 82\u0081 holding in his stool \u0081 medication side effects\u0081 excessive or long-term use of laxatives, suppositories, and enemas\u0081 malnutrition\u0081 cow's milk allergy\u0081 medical conditions DIETARY TREATMENT The rst thing you should do is adjust your child's diet. Making specic dietary modi- cations, adding basic and advanced supplements to his diet, and identifying and elim-inating problematic foods can vastly improve or even eliminate your child's GI issues. Istrongly encourage you to take your child to a registered dietitian for professional ad-vice and help in implementing the dietary modications I discuss below. Step 1: Make Appropriate Dietary Modifications Making sure your child is getting enough ber and water in his diet and limiting his con-sumption of fruit juice will promote normal daily bowel movements, which is the rst ba-sic step in healing his gut problems. Autistic children tend to accept a very limited varietyof foods, so their ber intake is usually inadequate. Refer back to page 29 in Step 2 for de-tails on how much ber and water (page 37) your child should have. Appendix 2 on page216 provides a list of high-ber foods you can offer your child. If your child has feedingproblems and is unwilling or unable to eat more high-ber foods, you may need to add aber supplement to his diet. However, it's important that you consult with a registered di-etitian or a gastroenterologist before starting your child on a ber product. If your childhas an intestinal obstruction, fecal impaction, or narrowing of the gastrointestinal tract, aber supplement could cause an impaction of stool in the colon. You should also consulta registered dietitian or gastroenterologist if your child has low muscle tone. He may beunable to push stool through his lower gastrointestinal tract, and adding too much di-etary ber or a ber supplement to his diet could result in a stool impaction. When adding ber to your child's diet, it's important to go slowly and make sure he's getting enough water in his diet before you increase his ber. Your child should bedrinking at most one cup of fruit juice a day, especially if he has loose stools. If he's gotchronic constipation, offer him pear or apple juice, which will help to increase the wa-ter content of his stools and the frequency of his bowel movements. Prune juice is alsoa great choice for constipation because it contains dihydroxyphenyl isatin, a natural83 STEP YOUR x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 83laxative substance that promotes bowel movements. I recommend mixing one to two ounces of prune juice into pear or apple juice on a daily basis. Step 2: Try Basic Supplements Basic supplements, such as probiotics , anti-fungals , and digestive enzymes , play a major role in healing your child's GI tract. The right combination of these basic sup-plements will support and maintain a healthy balance of naturally occurring microor-ganisms in your child's gastrointestinal tract. Probiotics The GI tract contains \"good bacteria,\" \"bad bacteria,\" and yeast, all of which must bemaintained at an ideal balance in order to support the immune system and the produc-tion of certain vitamins and digestive enzymes. Research shows that children withautism have signicant imbalances in their upper and lower gut microflora. A studypublished in the Journal of Medical Microbiology in 2005 indicated that severe gastroin- testinal problems in children with autism may be due to an imbalance of the gut mi-croflora, and that rebalancing the microflora may help to alleviate gastrointestinaldisorders common in autistic children. Probiotics, which are live microorganisms thatare similar to the benecial \"good bacteria\" found in the gut, can help improve the mi-croflora balance in your child's gastrointestinal tract. Probiotic supplements also workto accomplish the following: \u0081 enhance the immune system \u0081 decrease the frequency of acute and chronic diarrhea\u0081 create better-formed stools\u0081 improve dermatitis and eczema\u0081 maintain remission in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease\u0081 improve integrity of the gut barrier\u0081 decrease GI symptoms, gut inflammation, and intestinal permeability Most often, the bacteria used for probiotics come from two groups, Lactobacillus or Bidobacterium . Within each group, there are different species (for Lactobacil- lus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bidobacterium infantis, andBidobacterium lactis), and within each species there strains (or varieties). Bidobacterium , especially Bidobacterium lactis , is the most prevalent bacteria found in breastfed babies, making it the better supplement choice for infants and young children. Saccha-84 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 84romyces boulardii are yeasts that have probiotic properties and are often used in con- junction along with other probiotic supplements. Probiotic supplements come in capsule, powder, chewable, and liquid form, making them easy for most autistic kids to ingest. If you choose a liquid probiotic supplement, be aware that it has a much shorter shelf life than the capsules, chewables, and powders.You can nd probiotic supplements at most pharmacies, supermarkets, and health foodstores, or they can be ordered online. (For instance, Kirkman offers a wide variety ofhigh-quality probiotic supplements on its Web site www.kirkmangroup.com, or youcan call toll-free at 800-245-8282.) When choosing one for your child, make sure it hasat least 5 billion colony-forming units (CFU) per dose, as that's the minimum amountof CFU recommended by the Natural Health Products Directorate of Canada for abenecial effect. Also be sure that your child takes the probiotic every day. Studies showthat once a probiotic supplement is discontinued from the diet, the GI microflora re-turns to its presupplementation levels. I often recommend Culturelle, a well-knownprobiotic supplement that contains Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG , a specic strain with many well-documented health benets. It's guaranteed to deliver a minimum of 10 bil-lion CFU in each capsule and survive the strong acid of the stomach. (For a probioticsupplement to be effective, it must be able to survive the stomach acid so it can be de-livered and colonize in the small intestines and colon.) It's also good to know that pro-biotic supplements often contain fructooligosaccharides (FOS), which is a nondigestable carbohydrate. FOS is considered a prebiotic because it promotes the growth of Lacto- bacilli and Bidobacteria. Antifungals Herbs and natural food sources that have antifungal properties are often used in con-junction with probiotics. They help support a healthy balance of intestinal bacteria andyeast by keeping Candida albican yeast growth under control. Unlike probiotics, yourchild should not take an antifungal product on a daily basis. Antifungal products aretypically taken for a short period of time just to assist in healing your child's GI tract,and then they're discontinued. Antifungal products contain herbs such as pau d'arcoand other natural food sources that have antifungal properties such as garlic extract,grapefruit seed extract, and caprylic acid. Although most herbs are free of known sideeffects, there may be potential contraindications, precautions, and adverse reactions toconsider, especially for children, pregnant women, and nursing mothers. You shouldtalk to a registered dietitian or a nutrition-oriented physician for specic recommenda-tions for your child. Some good antifungal products on the market are Yeast Fighters,manufactured by T winLab, and YeastAid by Kirkman. 85 STEP HEAL YOUR GUT0738212432_1.qxp:PB: x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 85Digestive Enzymes Digestive enzymes are secreted in the mouth, stomach, and small intestines to break down food so the body can absorb and utilize the nutrients. Studies have indicated thatsome autistic children have low levels of intestinal carbohydrate digestive enzymes, so adigestive enzyme supplement with meals may help them better digest their food andimprove GI symptoms such as bloating, gas, diarrhea, and constipation. The body produces different digestive enzymes to break down different types of food, so I recommend that you select a basic multispectrum digestive enzyme productthat contains a blend of several different digestive enzymes. This will ensure your childwill be able to handle a wide range of foods. Some examples of important digestive en-zymes you should look for include the following: \u0081 protease\u2014breaks down protein into fats\u0081 amylase\u2014breaks down carbohydrate\u0081 and galactose\u0081 sucrase\u2014breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose There are also specialty digestive enzyme products available with higher potency lev- els as well as products formulated to target specic macronutrients, such as protein, fat, or carbohydrate. However, you should consult with a registered dietitian before choos-ing a higher potency or specially formulated product for your child. Over-the-counterdigestive enzymes are usually plant-derived, well tolerated, and come in capsule form.If your child can't swallow a capsule, pull the capsule apart and mix the powder into asmall amount of food or beverage at the beginning of his meal. Digestive enzyme prod-ucts don't require a prescription from a physician and can be purchased at most phar-macies, supermarkets, and health food stores or ordered online. Kirkman offers a widevariety of basic, higher potency, and specially formulated digestive enzyme products(www.kirkmangroup.com). Step 3: Consider Trying Advanced Supplements It's worthwhile to talk with a pediatric registered dietitian and/or a gastroenterologistabout trying your child on therapeutic levels of omega-3 fatty acids and glutamine tocombat his gastrointestinal problems. As you read earlier in this chapter, a signicant number of children with autism have inflammation throughout their GI tract. Omega-3 fatty acids have natural anti-86 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 86inflammatory properties, and research suggests that omega-3 fatty acid supplements may reduce the pain and inflammation associated with inflammatory bowel diseasessuch as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. If your child has severe gastrointestinalsymptoms or if the gastroenterologist has identied any gastrointestinal inflammation,a therapeutic level of omega-3 fatty acids for a short period of time may be a good op-tion for him. Keep in mind that it's very important you consult a registered dietitianor physician before giving your child a therapeutic level because there are potentialhealth risks associated with taking too much omega-3 fatty acids. (See Step 4 for moreinformation on the benets and risks of omega-3 fatty acids.) Glutamine is an amino acid necessary for brain, immune, and gastrointestinal func- tions. One of its most important roles is to help protect the lining of the gastrointesti-nal tract known as the mucosa. Recent research studies have linked glutamine to several other GI health benets, such as aiding in the maintenance of the gut barrier,promoting intestinal cell growth, promoting healing of the mucosa, inhibiting thegrowth of \"bad bacteria\" in the gut, improving diarrhea, and reducing the symptoms ofinflammatory bowel diseases. Glutamine is manufactured by the body, but it's also found in many dietary sources, such as beef, pork, chicken, sh, eggs, milk, dairy products, cabbage, spinach, and pars-ley. If your child has a very poor diet or suffers from certain medical conditions, infec-tions, or prolonged stress, his glutamine level may be depleted and he could benetfrom a glutamine supplement. Glutamine supplements are generally labeled as L-glutamine and are sold as an indi- vidual supplement and as part of a protein supplement. They are available in capsule,tablet, powder, and liquid form. There's no RDA for glutamine, so you need to talk toyour child's physician about proper dosage. The physician may order a serum aminoacid lab test to determine if your child has any amino acid deciencies before recom-mending a glutamine supplement. It's important to avoid a situation where your childis getting too much glutamine because excess glutamine is converted to glutamate andammonia, which are neurotoxic in high concentrations. Step 4: Identify and Eliminate Problematic Foods Common gastrointestinal symptoms such as reflux, vomiting, abdominal pain, ab-dominal distension, gaseousness, loose stools, diarrhea, and chronic constipation areindications that your child may have an allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance to one ormore foods. The most common food allergies among children are cow's milk, wheat,egg, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts. Problematic foods can have a huge impact on yourchild's overall health, gut function, brain function, feeding, and behavior, so it's87 STEP 6: HEAL YOUR CHILD'S GUT0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 87 crucial to identify and eliminate them from his diet. The good news is that if your child's GI symptoms are indeed being caused by one or more problematic foods,you'll quickly see a significant improvement in his symptoms once the foods areeliminated. The best way to identify problematic foods for your child is through the Elimina- tion/Challenge Diet, which I discuss in detail in Step 7. The Gluten Free Casein FreeDiet (GFCF) is also an elimination/challenge diet, it's specically used to deter-mine if gluten and casein are a problem for your child. In my clinical practice, I've hadgreat success with the GFCF Diet and believe it's one of the most effective dietary treat-ments to improve an autistic child's GI symptoms. T urn to Step 8 on page 103 for anin-depth discussion on this diet. MEDICAL TREATMENT If your child still has GI symptoms after working with a registered dietitian and tryingthe basic nutritional interventions, his physician will need to refer him to a pediatricgastroenterologist. A pediatric gastroenterologist will examine your child for more seri-ous GI disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), eosinophilic gas-trointestinal disorders malabsortion, bacteria overgrowth, inflammatory bowel disease(IBD), abnormal anatomy of the intestinal tract, and parasites. The gastroenterologistmay have to perform certain procedures to make his diagnosis, such as an abdominalX-ray, a gastric-emptying study, an upper GI endoscopy, colonoscopy, or a pH probe.He'll also order a number of laboratory tests to rule out biomedical abnormalities thatcould be contributing to your child's GI symptoms, such as: \u0081 Thyroid Panel, T3, T4, TSH (this test checks for hypothyroidism, which contributes to constipation; and hyperthyroidism, which contributes to diarrhea) \u0081 Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (this test checks for hypercalcemia and hy- pokalemia, both of which contribute to constipation) \u0081 Complete Blood Count (this test checks for iron deciency anemia) \u0081 Celiac Disease Panel (this test checks for celiac disease, which contributes to both constipation and diarrhea) \u0081 Blood Lead (this test checks for abnormally high lead levels, which contribute to constipation)88 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 88\u0081 Serum Carnitine (this test carnitine deciency, which contributes to constipation) \u0081 Stool Analysis (this test checks for parasites, harmful bacteria, and fat malabsorption) The results of the testing will help the gastroenterologist recommend the appropriate medical treatment, which may include medication and additional dietary interventions. PROJECT NO. 6: Take the following quiz to determine if your child is suffering from GI disorder symptoms: As an infant, did your child have any of the following? Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) _____ No _____ Yes No _____ Yes Projectile vomiting _____ No _____ Yes Sensitivity to cow's-milk-based infant formula _____ No _____ Yes Required a special infant formula _____ No _____ Yes Does your child currently have any of the following? Bloated stomach _____ No _____ Yes Stomach aches _____ _____ _____ Chronic diarrhea _____ No _____ Yes Loose stools _____ No _____ Yes Rarely has a normal formed stool _____ No _____ Yes Visible undigested food in stool _____ No _____ Yes Does your child have any of the following behavioral issues? Mealtime tantrums _____ No _____ Yes Consumes a limited variety of foods _____ No _____ Yes Refuses to eat _____ No _____ Yes89 STEP HEAL YOUR 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 89If you answered \"yes\" to at least one of the infant and child questions, or if your child has one or more chronic GI symptoms, you should talk to a registered dietitian about basic nutritional interventions that can help. Next, get a referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist for further testing if your child's GI symptoms persist after implementing the dietitian's recommendations. Autism and gastrointestinal disorders often go hand in hand, and GI symptoms can be a major contributing factor to your child's behavioral issues, feeding problems, andother autistic symptoms. Identifying and treating undiagnosed GI disorders is a criticalpart of treating your child's autism. Once you've completed Step 6, you should see asignicant improvement in your child's autistic symptoms. If your child suffers from afood allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance, Step 7 will show you exactly how to identify andeliminate any foods that are creating a problem. 90 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 90STEP 7 Identify and Treat Food Allergies Food allergies are becoming a serious concern for American children. An estimated 6 to 8 percent of children under the age of three suffer from food allergies, and the numberscontinue to rise. There's also a growing body of evidence that shows there's an increasedincidence of food allergies among children with autism and related disorders such asADHD compared to the general population of children. Autistic children may be morevulnerable to food allergies because of abnormalities in their digestive and/or immunesystems. Research also supports a link between food allergies and behavioral problems,though the medical community has been hesitant to acknowledge this. Understandinghow food allergies may be affecting your child and eliminating problematic foods fromhis diet is a critical component of his comprehensive treatment plan. THE FOOD ALLERGY-BEHAVIOR CONNECTION Food allergies don't cause children to have autism or other related disorders, but theydo affect children with these conditions more than typically developing children. Thisis because children with autism, Asperger's, PDD, ADHD, and ADD share a commonproblem\u2014they tend to have some degree of sensory integration dysfunction. You mayremember from Step 5 that children with sensory integration dysfunction have troubleresponding appropriately to sensory information from their environment. They'remore sensitive, become easily overwhelmed, and may overreact (or underreact) to audi-tory, visual, and tactile stimulation. If your child already has sensory issues, allergysymptoms like itchy skin, hives, eczema, runny nose, sneezing, and itchy, tearing eyeswill stress his sensory system further, making it even more difcult for him to functionnormally. The combination of food allergies and sensory issues can hinder your child'sability to sit still, concentrate, maintain focus, process information, learn, control his 910738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 91impulses and behavior, and interact with his teachers and therapists. Relieving your child of food allergy symptoms will lessen the sensory burden he has to deal with,which will improve his behavior. Autistic children are unique because they're often unable to verbally express the physi- cal discomfort and pain they feel from food allergy symptoms. If your child is nonverbalor has an expressive language delay, he can't tell you if he feels nausea, abdominal pain,chest pain from reflux, or headaches. Instead, your child has to \"communicate\" physicalpain through his behavior, such as head banging, tantrums, irritability, and food refusal.This is crucial for you to know because these behaviors are very often mistaken for typicalautistic behavioral problems instead of behaviors caused by undiagnosed food allergies. WHAT IS A FOOD ALLERGY? Although many people use the terms \"allergy,\" \"sensitivity,\" and \"intolerance\" inter-changeably, they really describe three different food-related conditions. An allergy is dened as an adverse immune response to a food protein. A food allergy occurs when the immune system mistakenly identies a specic protein found in foodas a harmful substance and defends against it. Food allergies are classied according tohow the immune system responds and are split into two categories: IgE mediated and non-IgE mediated. IgE Mediated Food Allergy With an IgE mediated food allergy, the immune system triggers immunoglobulin E(IgE) antibodies to bind with the food protein (also known as the allergen ) activating cells throughout the body to release histamine and other chemicals. These chemicals cause inflammation and a range of allergic reactions throughout the body, affecting yourchild's respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, eyes, ears, nose, and/or throat. IgE mediated reactions can be either immediate or delayed. Immediate reactions generally occur within seconds up to two hours after eating the offending food. De-layed reactions occur between two and forty-eight hours after eating the offendingfood. IgE mediated food allergies can be detected through special testing (see page ___for more information). Some people experience a more severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, where they have difculty breathing, a rapid pulse, dizziness, and enter a state of shock with arapid drop in blood pressure. Anaphylaxis is potentially life-threatening and requiresimmediate medical attention.92 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 92Non-IgE Mediated Food Allergy A non-IgE mediated food allergy triggers a different kind of immune system re- sponse. The immune system responds directly to a food protein, causing the releaseof certain chemicals. This leads to inflammation that causes a variety of milder reac-tions throughout the body, primarily in the gastrointestinal tract. GI symptoms include chronic diarrhea, loose stools, constipation, nausea, vomiting, reflux, bloat-ing, and abdominal pain. Non-IgE mediated food allergies can cause the develop-ment of serious gastrointestinal conditions, such as food protein-induced enterocolitis (the inflammation of the small and large intestines), gastroenteritis (the inflammation of the stomach and small intestines), and esophagitis (the inflam- mation of the esophagus). Many people don't realize that IgE mediated food allergies are responsible for only about 5 percent of adverse food reactions; the other 95 percent are caused by non-IgEmediated food allergies, sensitivities, and intolerances. Unfortunately, standard food al-lergy testing can identify only IgE mediated allergies. This is why an elimination/chal-lenge diet is so important. It's the only way to detect the other 95 percent of adversefood reactions that affect so many children. Sadly, most practitioners in the traditionalmedical community focus only on that 5 percent of testable reactions and overlook thesignicance of non-IgE mediated food allergies. This leaves countless children undiag-nosed, untreated, and continuing to suffer with gastrointestinal and other physicalproblems that negatively affect their behavior and ability to function normally. Studieshave demonstrated that when non-IgE mediated food allergies are treated in autisticchildren, their behavioral issues improve. Research conducted by Dr. Harumi Jy-onouchi and published in Neuropsychobiology in 2002 and 2005 and the Journal of Pe- diatrics in 2005 indicated that autistic children who had a non-IgE mediated immune response to gluten, casein, and soy experienced behavioral improvements when placedon a gluten, casein, and soy elimination diet. Clearly, children with non-IgE mediatedfood allergies will never have the opportunity to reach their full potential until their al-lergies are identied and treated. The symptoms of a non-IgE mediated food allergy generally develop several hours to days after eating the offending food. This type of allergy is much harder to identify be-cause currently there are no reliable diagnostic tests available to detect it. Since a non-IgE mediated food allergy reaction does not involve an IgE antibody, the standardRAST and prick skin tests are not useful. The only way you can determine if your childhas a non-IgE mediated allergy to specic foods is to put him on an elimination/chal-lenge diet. (See page 98 for information on implementing this diet.)93 STEP 7: IDENTIFY AND TREAT FOOD ALLERGIES0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 93Mixed IgE and Non-IgE Mediated Food Allergy Some kids suffer from a mix of IgE and non-IgE mediated food allergies, especially those who have eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG), andeosinophilic colitis (EC). In this case, a blood test and skin prick test will identify onlysome of your child's allergies, and an elimination/challenge diet must be used to iden-tify the rest. The Most Common Food Allergies The following foods are responsible for 90 percent of allergic reactions: \u0081m i l k nuts)\u0081 s h\u0081 shellsh Milk, wheat, soy, eggs, and peanuts are the most common food allergens in childrenunder the age of three. Allergic reactions to sh and shellsh are more common inadults, and allergic reactions to fruits and vegetables also tend to occur later in life. WHAT IS A FOOD SENSITIVITY? A food sensitivity is a general term used to describe an abnormal reaction to a food or food additive. A food sensitivity is different from a food allergy because the reactiondoesn't involve the immune system. Food sensitivity symptoms are virtually identical tothose of an allergy, but they tend to be much milder. If your child is sensitive to a par-ticular food, he's most likely reacting to the articial food additives in the food as op-posed to the food itself. The following articial additives are the most commonculprits: \u0081 sultes 2:27 PM Page 94\u0081M S G \u0081 yellow dye No. 5\u0081 preservatives (BHT and BHA) As you may recall from Step 1, you should eliminate all unnecessary articial food additives from your child's diet, such as articial colors, articial flavors, preservatives, and articial sweeteners. WHAT IS A FOOD INTOLERANCE? Similar to a food sensitivity, a food intolerance doesn't involve the immune system. Itoccurs when something in a food irritates a person's digestive system or when a personhas too few or none of the enzymes that enable him to properly digest, or break down,a food. For instance, if your child has too few or is missing the enzymes necessary tobreak down carbohydrates in the small intestines, the carbohydrates pass undigestedinto the colon where they ferment and produce excess gas, bloating, abdominal cramps,and diarrhea. The three carbohydrates that make up the most common food intolerances are lac- tose, sucrose, and fructose. You're probably familiar with the term lactose intolerance,which is the most common carbohydrate intolerance. If your child is lactose intolerant,his body doesn't have sufcient levels of lactase, the metabolizes lactose,the carbohydrate in milk. A lactase deciency will render your child unable to digestthe lactose in milk, so lactose passes from the small intestines undigested into the colonand causes abdominal symptoms. Lactose intolerance can be identied with an oraltolerance test or a hydrogen breath test . WHY DOES YOUR CHILD HAVE A FOOD ALLERGY? I mentioned earlier that experts believe autistic children may be more vulnerable tofood allergies because of abnormalities in their digestive and/or immune systems. In anormally functioning digestive system, digestive enzymes break down the protein infoods into small, single molecules called amino acids. The amino acids then passthrough the lining of the gastrointestinal wall (also known as the gut-blood barrier)into the bloodstream and are used throughout the body as needed. The junction be-tween cells in the gastrointestinal wall are tightly bound and act as a barrier to ensureonly small, single molecules such as amino acids, vitamins, and minerals are allowedinto the bloodstream. It's theorized that autistic children with gastrointestinal and/or95 STEP 7: IDENTIFY AND TREAT FOOD ALLERGIES0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 95immune system abnormalities have abnormally increased permeability (also known as \"leaky gut syndrome\") of their gut-blood barrier that allows large, intact protein mole-cules to pass into the bloodstream. This triggers their immune system to overreact to anotherwise harmless food, identifying the protein molecule as a foreign particle and ini-tiating a defense. As the protein molecule circulates throughout the body, cells react byreleasing histamine, cytokines ,interleukins, and other chemicals that trigger inflam- mation and allergy symptoms. If your child suffers from one or more of the following symptoms, a food allergy may be to blame: Ears\u2014otitis media (ear infections) Nose\u2014nasal congestion, sneezing, runny noseEyes\u2014tearing, puffy eyes, dark circles under eyesOral\u2014swelling of lips, tongue, mouth, and throatSkin\u2014hives, eczema, red cheeks, itchingRespiratory\u2014difculty breathing, cough, wheezing, asthmaIntestinal\u2014reflux, vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipationNeurological\u2014headache, migraine, and behavioral problems such as tantrums, irritability, and hyperactivity HOW TO IDENTIFY PROBLEMATIC FOODS FOR YOUR CHILD If you suspect your child suffers from a food allergy, sensitivity, or intolerance, take him to see a board-certied allergist for a denitive diagnosis. The allergist will perform aphysical exam, take down your child's medical and dietary history, and order diagnostictests to rule out other medical conditions. Then he'll order a RAST and skin prick testto help identify an IgE mediated allergy and will probably conduct a physician-supervised oral food challenge to conrm positive test results. He'll also likely suggest ashort-term elimination/challenge diet to identify any non-IgE mediated allergies. RAST Test If your child is older than one year, the allergist will perform a radioallergosorbent test(RAST) to help identify food allergies. The RAST is a blood test that detects IgE anti-bodies to a particular food. The allergist might also perform a CAP RAST or CAP96 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 96 System FEIA, which is a specic type of RAST test that indicates the level of IgE anti- bodies present for each allergen. This can help predict how severe your child's reactionto a problematic food will be. It's important to know that the RAST does have some limitations. About half of the time, the RAST returns a false-positive test result. This means that the RAST may detectan IgE antibody in your child and indicate a positive result for a particular food, butyour child isn't actually allergic to the food. This can lead to unnecessary elimination offoods from your child's diet. Usually, if the RAST results indicate a positive reaction to afood, the allergist will conduct an oral food challenge under his supervision. Your childwill be given capsules lled with the suspected allergen and watched for symptoms of anallergic reaction to determine if he's really allergic to that food. Once the allergist hasreached a denite diagnosis, the food will be eliminated from your child's diet. The RAST also returns a high percentage of false-negative results, which means that the test may not detect IgE mediated food allergies your child doeshave. Ultimately, the RAST is nothing more than a helpful screening test. It's not intended to provide a de-nitive diagnosis of food allergies. Also, the RAST can't detect non-IgE mediated foodallergies. Skin Prick Test The skin prick test is also used to help identify IgE mediated food allergies in childrenolder than one year. First, a small amount of a suspected food allergen is placed on your child's skin or on a testing device. Then the testing device pricks through the toplayer of your child's skin and inserts the allergen under the skin. If your child is allergic,a hive will form at that spot. Like the RAST, the skin prick test also has some limitations. Its false-positive rate is more than 50 percent, which is especially problematic for children with skin issues,such as eczema. The good news is that the skin prick test has a very low incidence offalse-negative results; if your child tests negative for an allergen, there's a 95 percentchance he's not allergic to that food. Like the RAST, the skin prick test is nothing more than a helpful screening test and is not intended to provide a denitive diagnosisof food allergies. The skin prick test also can't detect non-IgE mediated food allergies. Don't Forget about Airborne Allergies Some of the symptoms your child is experiencing may be caused by airborne allergies, such as pet dander, dust mites, mold, tree, weed, and grass pollens. 97 STEP 7: IDENTIFY AND TREAT FOOD ALLERGIES0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 97When the allergist orders blood drawn to complete a RAST for food allergens, ask that he also test for common airborne allergens so they too can be identied andtreated. Elimination/Challenge Diet The elimination/challenge diet is used to rule out false-positive and false-negative results from the RAST and skin prick tests. It's also the only method to identify non-IgE medi-ated food allergies. If you want to put your child on an elimination/challenge diet, besure to discuss with an allergist which foods can safely be challenged at home withoutmedical supervision. A short-term elimination/challenge diet involves two basic steps: 1. Eliminate the suspected food from your child's diet for two weeks. This will give your child's allergy symptoms time to subside. If your child hasEE, EG, and/or EC, suspected food allergens may need to be eliminated foreight to twelve weeks to achieve symptom improvement. The rst foods youshould eliminate are those that had positive RAST and/or skin prick test results.If both of these tests came back negative, start with the foods that tend to be themost likely culprits: milk, wheat, soy, eggs, peanuts, nuts, sh, and shellsh. 2. Challenge your child with an eliminated food. Once your child has been off a suspected allergenic food for the appropriateperiod of time, reintroduce the food to his diet for one week. Watch to see ifhis allergy symptoms recur. If you eliminated more than one food, add backone food at a time each week. It's very important that you consult with a registered dietitian about putting your child on this diet. These steps are very general, and a dietitian can adapt them to meetyour child's unique needs. Special issues such as consuming a very limited variety offoods or refusing to accept new foods will impact the number of foods that can beeliminated from your child's diet at a given time. An elimination/challenge diet is morecomplicated for autistic children who have a feeding problem or self-limit their diet tofoods consisting exclusively of milk and wheat products. In this situation, the best ap-proach is usually to address your child's feeding problem rst before eliminating anyfoods from his diet. 98 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 98There are many other diagnostic allergy tests available, but most are questionable and considered very controversial. Of these tests, the one most commonly used for autistic children is the IgG ELISA blood test, which tests for more than one hundreddifferent foods. The American Academy of Allergy and Immunology's position is thatthis test is lacking and not an acceptable method of diagnosing food allergies. Mostmainstream physicians and allergists also claim there is no value to this test. However,physicians who practice complementary medicine claim that the IgG ELISA test iden-ties delayed food allergies and is useful in treating autism, hyperactivity, arthritis, fa-tigue, headaches, and other conditions. Several research studies have been published inthe Scandinavian Journal of Gastroenterology and the Journal of the American College of Nutrition since 2004 that indicate that food elimination based on positive IgG ELISA test results strongly correlates with signicant improvement in individuals diagnosedwith Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). It appears that the IgG ELISA blood test may atleast be helpful in treating gastrointestinal symptoms, which is a major problem forautistic children. NUTRITIONAL TREATMENT FOR FOOD ALLERGIES If your child has been diagnosed with a food allergy, getting professional help from aregistered dietitian is critical. The dietitian will guide you through the nutrition ther-apy component of treating food allergies, which involves nutritional interventions toheal the gastrointestinal tract, elimination of allergenic foods, identifying and resolvingany nutrient deciencies, and assessing your child's growth. Unfortunately, I've found that when a child is diagnosed with one or more food al- lergies, his parents are not referred to a registered dietitian. Instead, the allergist sendsthem home with a long list of foods to avoid. The parents do their best to eliminate theallergenic foods, but often they don't know what foods to substitute, causing theirchild's diet to become extremely limited and nutritionally inadequate. This is especiallya problem for autistic children who often already have a very limited diet. Eliminatingcommon foods such as milk, wheat, eggs, and soy can have a major impact on the nu-tritional quality of your child's diet. Studies indicate that children with two or morefood allergies have low intakes of calcium, iron, vitamin D, vitamin E, and zinc and areat higher risk for decreased growth in height. Make sure you get a dietitian referralfrom your child's physician and/or allergist, and don't attempt to implement this dieton your own. 99 STEP 7: IDENTIFY AND TREAT FOOD ALLERGIES0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 99Healing the GI Tract Healing your child's GI tract is an important component of treating food allergies, espe- cially for autistic children with gastrointestinal disorders. As I mentioned earlier, yourchild's gut-blood barrier may have abnormal increased permeability (also referred to as\"leaky\"), allowing large, intact protein molecules into the bloodstream and triggering theimmune system to overreact. In this case, healing his GI tract before starting an elimina-tion diet is a more effective food allergy treatment than the elimination diet alone. Onceyour child's GI tract is healed, his intestinal permeability will become normal, his gas-trointestinal inflammation will decrease, and his digestive system will be restored togood health. T urn back to Step 6 on page 83 for details on the three important nutri-tional interventions that will heal your child's gut: dietary treatment (adequate ber andwater); basic supplements (probiotics, antifungals, and digestive enzymes); and (therapeutic levels of omega-3 fatty acids and glutamine). The Elimination Diet An elimination diet seems like it should be pretty straightforward\u2014your child will cutallergenic foods from his diet. However, this diet can be very complicated, especially ifyour child has multiple food allergies. A registered dietitian will help you: \u0081 understand how to avoid allergenic foods, \u0081 nd appropriate substitutions for eliminated foods,\u0081 handle eating situations away from home,\u0081 make meal modications for school lunch,\u0081 read food labels,\u0081 avoid cross-contamination of allergenic foods and safe foods,\u0081 locate local and mail-order sources for allergen-free products, \u0081 replace the nutrients lost from the eliminated foods. Studies indicate that approximately 44 percent of children younger than three years of age with allergies to milk, wheat, soy, and eggs outgrow their food allergy within one to seven years. (Allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, sh, and shellsh are often lifelong, and foodallergies that develop after the age of three years are less likely to be outgrown.) If you re-move known allergenic foods from your child's diet, it actually improves his chances ofoutgrowing his allergies. In light of this, it's a good idea for you to re-challenge your childafter one year on the elimination diet to see if he's still reactive to the allergenic foods. Ifhis allergy symptoms don't return, you can add the foods back into his diet. If your child100 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 100does react to the food re-challenge, continue to avoid the allergenic foods and do a re- challenge on an annual basis. If your child's allergic reaction symptoms to problematicfoods are severe, consult with an allergist before doing a food re-challenge. An excellent resource of educational materials and more detailed information related to food allergies, including list of foods and ingredients to avoid, can be found on theFood Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network (FAAN) Web site at www.foodallergy.org. Ben's Story Four-year-old Ben was diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder\u2014not otherwise specied (PDD-NOS), sensory integration dysfunction, and delayedspeech. At the age of two, Ben's mother suspected he had problems with certainfoods. She reported that after eating wheat products he became agitated and morehyperactive. She also reported that Ben had stomach aches and didn't participate inhis therapy sessions after eating lunch. Instead he would lie flat and outstretched,pressing his stomach into the floor, and would refuse to get up. He also had chronicdiarrhea, eczema, wheezing, and a constant runny nose. When Ben tried peanutsfor the rst time, his lips swelled up, so Ben's mom took him to an allergist. The RASTcame back positive for multiple food allergies\u2014peanut, soybean, wheat, corn, andegg white. He also tested positive for dust mites, cat and dog dander, grass, andragweed. Ben's mom told me she had been advised to eliminate peanuts, soy,wheat, corn, and eggs from Ben's diet; provided with and instructed on how to useanEPIPEN ; given prescriptions for Rhinocort nasal spray, topical cortisol steroid cream, and an oral antihistamine medication; and she was given several handoutswith lists of foods to avoid. A physician-supervised oral food challenge or short-termelimination/challenge diet was not conducted to conrm the food allergies. Ben'smom was not referred to a registered dietitian to help her implement Ben's long-termelimination diet. She told me it was extremely difcult trying to eliminate so manyfoods from Ben's diet and that she was feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. Shechose to focus on the elimination of peanuts and allowed Ben to continue to eat theother foods. Ben continued to suffer with behavioral problems after meals, stomachaches, and diarrhea. He got partial relief from the eczema, wheezing, and runnynose from medications his doctor prescribed. Ben was four when I began to work with him. I referred him to another board-certied allergist, who assessed him comprehensively and took a more holisticapproach to treating both his airborne and food allergies. The allergist supervisedan oral food challenge, which indicated that Ben had an immediate reaction to101 STEP 7: IDENTIFY AND TREAT FOOD ALLERGIES0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 101peanuts. A short-term elimination/challenge diet for wheat, soy, corn, and eggs indicted that Ben reacted to wheat and soy, but corn and eggs were not a problem.Ben's long-term elimination diet consisted of avoiding peanuts, wheat, and soy. Ben'ssymptoms of diarrhea, eczema, wheezing, stomach aches, and behavioral problemsafter meals all disappeared. He was able to stop using the Rhinocort nasal sprayand topical cortisol steroid cream and instead began using an oral antihistamineoccasionally for seasonal airborne allergies. After one year on the elimination diet,Ben was re-challenged with wheat and soy. This time he was able to tolerate soy, butwheat continued to trigger allergic reactions. It was recommended that Ben continuea wheat and peanut elimination diet. His mom reports that Ben is now free of bothallergy symptoms and medications and is a healthier and happier child. PROJECT NO. 7: IDENTIFY AND TREAT YOUR CHILD'S FOOD ALLERGIES 1. Look at the list of food allergy symptoms on page 96. Does your child experi- ence any of these symptoms on a frequent or chronic basis? If so, schedule an appointment with a board-certied allergist to identify IgE mediated foodallergies using RAST and skin prick tests. Conrm positive results with a physician-supervised oral food challenge or short-term elimination/challengediet as recommended by the allergist. Then you should nd a registered dieti-tian who can help you implement a short-term elimination/challenge diet toidentify possible non-IgE mediated food allergies. 2. Once your child is diagnosed with a particular food allergy, work with a dieti- tian to avoid that food using a long-term elimination diet. As you can see, diagnosing food allergies is complicated, test results are difcult to in-terpret, current blood lab and skin tests aren't always accurate, some allergy tests arecontroversial, and treatment is challenging. Even so, identifying and treating yourchild's food allergies has enormous benets. He will experience a wide range of physi-cal, gastrointestinal, and neurological (including behavioral) improvements. Avoidingproblematic foods is a critical step in nutritional treatment of your child's autism. Thenext step is to consider some of the special elimination diets that are commonly recom-mended for autistic children. 102 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 102STEP 8 Consider Putting Your Child on a Special Elimination Diet Elimination diets, especially the Gluten Free Casein Free (GFCF) diet, are very popular in the autism community. Parents have long claimed that these diets are effective in re-lieving autistic symptoms. However, there's very little evidence-based scientic researchout there that supports or refutes these claims. These dietary interventions are consid-ered controversial and usually not supported by the medical community. That said, thisdoesn't necessarily mean that one of these elimination diets won't be helpful for yourchild. In this chapter, I focus mainly on the GFCF diet, as my experience has shownthis to be the most effective diet for autistic kids. You'll learn about the theory behindthe GFCF diet, the potential benets, and how to transition your child onto it. I alsodiscuss the Specic Carbohydrate Diet (SCD), the rotation diet, the antifungal diet,and the Feingold Diet. It's very important that you don't try to implement any elimina-tion diet on your own. Find a knowledgeable registered dietitian who can work withyou to ensure the diet is implemented properly, show you how to assess the diet's effec-tiveness, and help you replace lost nutrients from eliminated foods so you're not com-promising your child's nutritional health. THE GLUTEN FREE CASEIN FREE DIET (GFCF DIET) The GFCF diet is the single most common elimination diet recommended for autisticchildren. It's not considered a \"cure\" for autism, but rather a means to relieve autistic,behavioral, and gastrointestinal symptoms in autistic children. There are several theo-ries as to why eliminating the proteins gluten (found in wheat, rye, and barley) and ca-sein (found in milk) from the diet may be benecial. 1030738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 103The Opiate Excess Theory The link between gluten, casein, and autism was rst reported by K. Reichelt, M.D., in the 1980s. Reichelt performed a study in which he analyzed the urine of autistic childrenand found abnormally high levels of the peptides gliadomorphine and casomorphine. Peptides, which are short chains of amino acids, are created when the digestion of pro-teins by enzymes is not completed. The peptide gliadomorphine results from the incom-plete digestion of gluten, and casomorphine is the result of the incomplete digestion ofcasein. Gliadomorphine and casomorphine are referred to as opiate peptides because their chemical structure is similar to opiates. It's been proposed that these opiate peptidesmay also act similarly to opiates, depressing the central nervous system, which could pre-cipitate or aggravate autistic symptoms. Thus the \"opiate excess theory\" was born. Opiates naturally occur in the central nervous system (CNS), but the levels of opiate peptides that Reichelt found in the urine of autistic children were too high to haveoriginated in the CNS. So the conclusion was that the excessive levels of gliadomor-phine and casomorphine peptides came from an outside source\u2014the incomplete diges-tion of gluten and casein found in foods. Since peptides are generally too large to passthrough the gastrointestinal wall into the bloodstream, the theory suggests that theygot into the blood through a \"leaky gut.\" In other words, the linings of the autistic chil-dren's intestinal tracts were too permeable, allowing the opiate peptides to slip throughthe gut-blood barrier into the bloodstream. The peptides were then transported to thekidneys and excreted out of the body in urine. The theory goes on to say that if some ofthe opiate peptides were not excreted and instead stayed in the bloodstream, they couldpossibly cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and attach to opiate receptors in the brain. If this happened, the peptides would mimic other opiates, such as morphine,and interfere with normal brain function, resulting in autistic symptoms. If the opiate excess theory is accurate, then removing the dietary sources of opiate peptides (gluten and casein) from your child's diet would help improve his behavioraland autistic symptoms. The Non-IgE Mediated Food Allergy Theory This more recent theory suggests that autistic children may be predisposed to allergic re-actions to dietary proteins (gluten, casein, and soy), which leads to gastrointestinal in-flammation and behavioral symptoms. Research conducted by Dr. Harami Jyonouchiindicates that while only a small percentage of autistic children tested positive for IgE-mediated food allergies via IgE RAST and skin prick tests for gluten, casein, and soy, asignicant percentage of these same children experienced symptom improvement on agluten, casein, and soy elimination diet. Jyonouchi found that autistic children had an104 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 104increased proinflammatory cytokine response to gluten, casein, and soy, which indicates that these children did indeed have a non-IgE-mediated immune reaction to dietaryproteins. The studies concluded that non-IgE-mediated immune reactions to gluten, ca-sein, and soy play a role in gastrointestinal symptoms in autistic children. SHOULD YOU PUT YOUR CHILD ON THE GFCF DIET? As I mentioned earlier, there's very little research-based evidence that supports or re-futes the effectiveness of the GFCF diet for autistic children. However, since the early1980s, many parents have tried the diet with their autistic children, and the vast major-ity report positive results. According to these anecdotal reports, the GFCF diet accom-plishes the following: \u0081 relieves gastrointestinal symptoms \u0081 children pass normal, formed stools\u0081 decreases hyperactivity\u0081 increases focus\u0081 reduces behavioral problems\u0081 improves speech and communication skills\u0081 and improves sleep Parents often ask me if there's a lab test that can tell them for sure whether their child will benet from the GFCF diet before they start it. Unfortunately, the answer is no. Some private labs do promote a urinary peptides test that measures the level of gli-adomorphine and casomorphine in urine; however, this test is very controversial andusually not recommended by medical professionals. The only sure way to knowwhether your child will respond positively to the GFCF diet is to try him on it, andthat choice is yours alone. If you do decide to move forward, you'll need to keep yourchild on the diet for at least three full months for trustworthy results. UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS Gluten, casein, and soy (I include soy here because it's another highly allergenic dietaryprotein that I usually suggest eliminating as part of the GFCF diet) are found in morefoods and beverages than you may think. It's really important that you're able to recog-nize products that may contain these proteins. The following is a rundown of the basics. 105 STEP 8: CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR CHILD ON A SPECIAL ELIMINATION DIET0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 105Gluten Gluten is the protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It gives flour its elasticity, which allows for leavening , and provides texture to baked products. Gluten is commonly found in breads, pasta, cereals, and baked goods. It's not found in oats, but oat is elim-inated from the GFCF diet because of the high possibility of cross contamination by wheat, barley, or rye during its processing and distribution. Also, research indicates thatavenin , the protein found in oats, has a peptide sequence that closely resembles wheat gluten, so cutting out oat makes sense. Gluten is used as a stabilizing agent in food products, so it can be found in unex- pected places. You'll need to read food ingredient labels carefully to identify productsthat may have \"hidden gluten\" and need to be avoided. There are some food additivesthat may or may not contain gluten, and you'll need to contact the manufacturer forclarication. Nonfood sources also need to be considered because gluten is often usedin medications, vitamin and mineral supplements, cosmetics, and other products.Here's a list of common food products to avoid:106 EATING FOR AUTISM barley brancouscousCream of WheatfarinaKamutmaltmatzo/matzoh mealoatstriticaleudonwheatwheat barleytabbouleh These food additives maycontain gluten, so to contact the manufacturer out: emulsiers modied food starch vegetable protein Note: Be aware that convenience foods often use gluten-containing flours as a thickener in gravies, soups, and custards.0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 106Here are some common nonfood sources of gluten to be aware of: over-the-counter and prescription medications vitamin and mineral supplements (especially tablet form)cosmetics (lipstick, lip gloss, and lip balms)Play-Dohglue And lastly, here is a list of gluten-free foods that are safe to include in your child's diet:107 STEP 8: CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR CHILD ON oilkashalegumes (beans, fava bean, soybean, garbanzo bean, lentils, peas, peanuts) locust bean gummaltodextrin (from corn or rice)meatshshellshgamemilletnuts (almond, chestnut, acorn, hazelnut, walnuts, Brazil, cashew) popcornpotatoesquinoaricerice products (rice cakes, pasta, bread, crackers, pasta) (Continues )0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 107Casein Casein is the protein found in milk and milk products. When eliminating milk from your child's diet, you're also eliminating a major source of calcium, vitamin D, and pro-tein, so be sure to enlist the help of a registered dietitian to assess your child's diet andrecommend replacements for these key nutrients.

Soy Soybean, also known as soya bean, is a type of legume. It's considered a good source of protein because it contains all nine of the essential amino acids needed to build andmaintain human body tissues. Until recently, soy was used as a substitution for dairyproducts in the GFCF diet, Now, because of the research done by Dr. Jyonouchi (seepage 93 for more on this) and the fact that soy is a common food allergen, most health-care practitioners agree that it's best to also eliminate soy while on the GFCF diet.Here's a list of common foods your child should avoid: edamane shoyu sauce soy flour soy milk natto soy soy sauce soy sprouts miso Tamari sauce tofu0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 109The following food additives may contain soy, so you'll need to contact the manu- facturer protein (TVP) GETTING YOUR CHILD STARTED Starting an autistic child on an elimination diet must be handled very carefully. Many autistic kids' diets consists mostly of wheat, milk, and processed food products. Manyhave feeding problems such as refusing new foods, mealtime tantrums, and refusing toeat. So it's not as simple as just cutting out foods containing gluten and casein and re-placing them with new, safe foods. Given these complications, you'll probably need totake some additional steps to prepare your child for the transition to the GFCF diet be-fore you actually start it. I nd it helpful to break it into two stages: preparing to startthe diet and then the actual elimination of gluten, casein, and soy. Each stage has a pro-gression of steps that allow you to move forward at your own comfort level. Stage 1: Preparing to Start the GFCF Diet Step 1: Find Professional Help. An elimination/challenge diet is considered nutrition therapy. You should recruit help from a medical professional, preferably a registered dietitian. Step 2: Focus on the Foods Your Child Can Eat. With help from the RD, make a list of all the foods your child is allowed to eat, whether he's willing to eat them or not.You'll be surprised by how extensive your list is. Then mark which foods your child willcurrently eat and compile his personal \"safe foods\" list. Step 3: Prepare Meals with Whole Foods That Are Naturally Gluten- and Casein- Free. Get back to the basics by preparing simpler meals using healthy, whole foods and rely less on prepackaged processed foods that contain \"unsafe\" ingredients. Select foodssuch as meat, poultry, sh, shellsh, game, eggs, dried beans and peas, nuts and seeds,fruits, vegetables, potatoes, rice, and corn.110 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 110Step 4: Buy Gluten- and Casein-Free Food Products. These days, most grocery stores have a section dedicated to special foods, including gluten- and casein-free foods. Cer- tainly your local health food store and Whole Foods Market carry many gluten- and casein-free choices. You can also search the Internet for mail order companies that spe-cialize in allergen-free foods and packaged pre-mixes. Step 5: Join a Parent Support Group. It's easy to feel overwhelmed during this pro- cess, and a support group can help you work through your feelings and offer much-needed support. Also, networking with other parents of autistic children using theGFCF diet is a great way to get information, advice, and learn about other helpful re-sources. Stage 2: Eliminating Gluten and Casein Step 1: Expose Your Child to Gluten- and Casein-Free Foods in a Gradual and Non- threatening Manner. At each meal, along with the typical foods your child is willing to eat, offer him at least one gluten- and casein-free food to start the exposure process.Your child needs to see, smell, and touch a new food, even if he won't eat it yet. If your child has serious feeding problems,such as throwing tantrums at the sight of a new food or refusing to tolerate new foods on the dinner table or his plate, you maynot be able to accomplish Step 1. Serious feeding problems like these require feedingtherapy from a team of professionals, as I discussed in Step 5. If this is the case for yourchild, gluten- and casein-free foods should be introduced during his feeding therapysessions. You'll need to delay starting the elimination stage until his feeding problemimproves, he tolerates new foods on his plate, and his diet has expanded to include eat-ing gluten- and casein-free foods. Step 2: Eliminate Obvious Sources of Gluten and Casein from Your Child's Diet. Identify the foods your child currently eats that are the most obvious sources of glutenand casein and replace them with a gluten- and casein-free alternative. These new, \"safe\"foods must also replace the vitamins, minerals, protein, and other nutrients that are lostfrom the eliminated foods. For example, replace cow's milk with \"fortied\" rice milk. Step 3: Identify and Eliminate \"Hidden\" Sources of Gluten and Casein. Processed foods and prepackaged foods often contain hidden sources of gluten and casein. Readfood ingredient labels closely and look for uncertain food additives that may containgluten or casein. If you're not sure about a food product, contact the manufacturerand ask exactly what ingredients it contains. Also, look for gluten and casein in the111 STEP 8: CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR CHILD ON A SPECIAL ELIMINATION DIET0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 111common nonfood sources, such as medicine and vitamin and mineral supplements. Replace any unsafe products with a safe alternative. Step 4: Fill Family, Friends, Teachers, and Caregivers in on Your Plan. You'll need to educate your child's caregivers, extended family, daycare, and school staff about theGFCF diet and request their full cooperation to implement the diet properly. It's im-portant for you to feel condent that your child's GFCF diet is being adhered to every-where he goes. Your child's dietitian can act as a consultant to his daycare and schoolcafeteria staff to ensure the menu accommodates his dietary restrictions. Step 5: Assess Whether Your Child is a \"Positive Responder\" or \"Nonresponder\" to the Diet. A large percentage of autistic children are considered \"positive responders,\" which means they experience symptom improvement on the GFCF diet and whengluten and/or casein is added back to their diet, the symptoms return. However, theGFCF diet doesn't help every autistic child. A \"nonresponder\" to the diet won't showany symptom improvement at all. It may take some time to completely transition your child to the GFCF diet, de- pending on his feeding and sensory issues. Once you feel condent that you've com-pletely eliminated gluten and casein diet, it's time to ofcially beginthe three-month elimination phase to determine whether he's a positive responder ornonresponder. You'll need to be observant and objective and record your child's autis-tic, behavioral, and physical symptoms at these three points in the diet: \u0081 prior to starting the elimination diet \u0081 at the end of the elimination period\u0081 during the challenge phase (when gluten and casein are added back into his diet). When you add gluten and casein back into your child's diet, I suggest challenging rst with casein, then the next week with gluten. This way you can determine if just gluten, just casein, or both are a problem. If your child is a positive responder to theelimination of gluten and/or casein, eliminate them from your child's diet for a yearand then re-challenge him. It's possible that he'll no longer have a reaction to glutenand/or casein and will be able to add moderate amounts back into his diet. An organization called Talking About Curing Autism (TACA) is an excellent resource for parents with autistic kids on the GFCF diet. Visit its Web site at www.talka-boutcuringautism.org.112 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 112EXPLORING OTHER ELIMINATION DIETS The GFCF diet isn't the only elimination diet commonly suggested for autistic chil- dren. I don't typically recommend the following diets for autistic children; however, Iinform the parents I work with that if they want to try any of these diets, I'll be there tosupport their decision and help them implement it safely. The Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD) The Specic Carbohydrate Diet is one of the newer elimination diets and has becomequite popular within the autism community over the last few years. It's suggested fortreating a small subset of autistic children with gastrointestinal symptoms such aschronic loose stools, intermittent constipation, gas, bloating, and abdominal pain whohave been nonresponders to other elimination diets. The SCD is based on the theory that single sugar unit carbohydrates (monosaccha- rides) are easily digested and well absorbed whereas carbohydrates containing two ormore sugar units (disaccharides and polysaccharides) are difcult to digest, especially forthose with a compromised gastrointestinal tract and inadequate production of carbohy-drate digestive enzymes. If carbohydrates pass undigested through the small intestinesinto the large intestines, it causes signicant intestinal problems. The undigested, unab-sorbed carbohydrates that make their way to the large intestines undergo a process calledfermentation. Fermentation results in excess gas, bloating, loose stools, constipation, andthe production of short-chain organic acids such as lactic and acetic acids, which pro-motes bacterial overgrowth. Bacterial overgrowth in the intestines leads to intestinal in-flammation, which inhibits the absorption of nutrients, especially vitamin B 12. The SCD allows your child to consume the easily digestible single sugar unit monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, and galactose) disaccharides (su-crose, lactose, and maltose) and polysaccharides (starches) from his diet. As his gas-trointestinal symptoms improve, the disaccharide and polysaccharide carbohydratefoods are gradually added back into his diet as tolerated. The goal of this diet is to cor-rect dysbiosis (the imbalance of yeast, bad bacteria, and good bacteria in the gut), de- crease intestinal inflammation, heal the intestinal tract, and restore health to thedigestive system. The SCD was originally developed by Dr. Sydney Haas for adults suffering from in- flammatory bowel diseases. However, since a large number of autistic children have gas-trointestinal symptoms, the diet is now commonly used as a dietary treatment forautism. Many parents of autistic children have tried the SCD and reported positive113 STEP 8: CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR CHILD ON A SPECIAL ELIMINATION DIET0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 113 results in their child's gastrointestinal and behavioral symptoms, increasing its recent popularity in the autism community. If you're interested in trying the SCD, my adviceis to proceed with caution. The SCD is a very restrictive diet, making it extremely challenging (even impossible) for many autistic children to follow. Your child must eata wide variety of foods to be placed on such a restrictive diet. Additionally, in my clini-cal experience, very few children actually need to be on the SCD. I've found that it's usually more benecial to focus on expanding your child's diet to include adequate pro-tein, healthy fats, unrened complex carbohydrates, and nutrient-rich simple carbohy-drates and limiting excess carbohydrates. This alone is a great start in healing yourchild's gastrointestinal tract. Before trying such a restrictive diet, I suggest you try thenutritional interventions I've discussed in this book rst. You may nd that the SCD isnot necessary for your child. The Rotation Diet The rotation diet is based on the t heory that the li kelihood your child will have an al- lergic reaction to a food increases over time with exposure. Many physicians practic-ing complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use the IgG ELISA test toidentify foods that are believed to cause a delayed food hypersensitivity reaction.These physicians may also use the Mediator Release Test (MRT), which is believed toidentify potential non-IgE mediated food reactions. You'll be given a four-day rota-tion diet plan for your child where a \"safe food\" is eaten only one day every fourdays. So on day one, your child can eat all the foods on that day's food list, and thesefoods will not be eaten again until day four. It's believed that rotating foods everyfour or more days will minimize reactions and reduce the likelihood of developing anallergy to these foods. The Antifungal Diet The antifungal diet, also called a yeast-free diet, is based on the theory that autistic chil-dren commonly have an overgrowth of Candida albicans yeast in their digestive tract, which contributes to \"leaky gut syndrome.\" The antifungal diet is typically used inconjunction with probiotics, antifungals, and medication to get the yeast under controland normalize the microflora balance in the gastrointestinal tract. The diet eliminatesfoods that contain yeast and foods that supposedly stimulate the growth of yeast. Foodsthat will be removed from your child's diet include sugar, fruit, fruit juices, fermentedfoods, baker's yeast, and aged foods. The complete list of foods eliminated on the anti-fungal diet is quite extensive and includes foods that your child probably eats a lot of.This is another very restrictive diet, so I advise you to proceed with caution and rst114 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 114pursue the nutritional interventions discussed in Step 6 to heal the gastrointestinal tract. More detailed information on the antifungal diet can be found on the Web atwww.yeastconnection.com. The Feingold Diet The Feingold Diet, also called the Feingold Program, was originally developed by Dr.Ben Feingold in the 1970s. He theorized that certain foods and food additives triggera variety of adverse physical and behavioral symptoms in sensitive children. Commonphysical symptoms include headaches, hives, itchy skin, stomach pain, and bed wet-ting. Behavioral symptoms include hyperactivity and poor concentration. The foodsthat were believed to be creating these adverse symptoms contained salicylates , which are chemicals that occur naturally in many plants. Chemicals used in articial colors,articial flavors, preservatives, and aspartame also contain salicylates. The natural sali-cylate compound found in plants is also chemically similar to manufactured aspirin. Simply put, the Feingold Diet is a two-stage salicylate elimination diet. In stage one, articial colors, articial flavors, preservatives (BHA, BHT, and TBHA), aspartame,foods containing salicylates, and aspirin are eliminated. Foods that contain salicylatesinclude almonds, apples, apricots, berries, cherries, cloves, coffee, cucumbers, of wintergreen, oranges, peaches, peppers, pickles, plums,prunes, raisins, tangerines, tea, and tomatoes. After four to six weeks on stage one andsymptom improvement is observed in your child, stage two is initiated, which involvesadding back foods that contain salicylates. Foods are introduced back into your child'sdiet one at a time to determine which foods cause an adverse reaction. Some childrenare hypersensitive to salicylates and may experience signicant improvement on the sal-icylate elimination diet. More often, though, autistic children are sensitive to salicylate-containing chemicals such as articial colors, articial flavors, preservatives, andaspartame instead of salicylate-containing foods. Salicylates are of special interest in the autism community because they may suppress the enzyme phenol sulfotransferase (PST) . PST is a key enzyme in the liver responsible for the elimination of toxins from the body. The enormous amount of salicylate-containing chemicals added to our foods put an extra burden on your child's detoxica-tion system. To lessen the burden and enhance your child's detoxication systemfunction, it's best to eliminate articial colors, articial preservatives (BHA,BHT, and TBHA), and aspartame from your child's diet regardless of his reaction tofoods containing salicylates.

He suffered from loose stools, and his mom told me he had bowel problemssince infancy, making it very difcult to start potty training. Vincent didn't have any signicant feeding problems except that he refused to eat fresh fruits and vegetables\u2014he would only eat them cooked. He consumed a varietyof foods and accepted new cooked foods after several exposures. An IgE RAST foodallergy test indicated he was positive for soy and milk. His mom replaced cow's milkwith soy milk, but she allowed him to eat other dairy products. Vincent's mother wasvery health-conscious, cooked most meals from scratch, and avoided processed andprepackaged foods and articial colors and flavors. When I rst saw Vincent, his parents were ready to try the GFCF diet. But before we could start the diet, Vincent needed to have completed the steps I describe in thisbook. His mom had already completed steps 1 through 3; we started Vincent on aomega-3 fatty acid supplement (Step 4); to address his aversion to fresh fruits andvegetables, he started feeding therapy with his current therapists (Step 5); since hehad a history of gastrointestinal problems, we started a gut healing program ofdigestive enzymes and probiotics (Step 6), which signicantly improved his loosestools but didn't completely normalize them; and since allergy testing indicated thathe may be allergic to cow's milk and soy, we combined steps 7 and 8, eliminatingsoy along with gluten and casein. Before Vincent began the GFCF diet, his parents, therapists, and teacher documented his current symptoms to obtain a baseline for comparison. SinceVincent didn't have any serious feeding problems, he easily transitioned to agluten-, casein-, and soy-free diet within a few weeks. His parents, therapists, andteacher continued to record his symptoms on a weekly basis to document hisresponse to the diet. After two weeks or so without gluten, casein, and soy, theybegan to note improvements in Vincent. His behavior improved, he had fewertantrums, a higher tolerance level to frustration, and better eye contact. His momnoted that his bowel problem was totally resolved; he had normally formed stoolsfor the rst time and was able to start potty training. As the weeks went by over thethree-month period, they saw continued improvement in his behavior, and hebecame more engaged with his siblings and other people in his environment. Thetherapists were very excited about Vincent's new willingness to cooperate andinteract during the speech and occupational therapy sessions. Everyone commented116 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 116that Vincent was smiling, appeared happier, and was just a pleasant child. At the end of the three-month elimination phase, everyone agreed that the GFCF diet washelping Vincent and should be continued. Now it was time to challenge Vincent and determine which food protein was contributing to which symptoms. The rst week soy was added back into Vincent'sdiet. His parents, therapists, and teacher watched for regression in any of hisbehavioral or gastrointestinal symptoms but saw none, so soy was allowed back intohis diet. The second week, cow's milk and other dairy products were added backinto his diet. Within a few days his mom noted that Vincent had a return of loosestools; so cow's milk and all dairy products were eliminated from his diet. The thirdweek gluten was added back, and within one day his therapists and teacherobserved slight regression in his behavior. A few days later they reported thatVincent continued to regress to the point where he was having daily tantrums, wasuncooperative in therapy sessions, and was functioning at the level prior to startingthe GFCF diet. Since Vincent's regression was so signicant, the gluten challengewas immediately stopped. After a few days back on the GFCF diet Vincent'sbehavioral symptoms improved, reinforcing that he was a positive responder to the diet. The school staff who were involved in observing Vincent's response to the GFCF diet were so impressed with the benets that they asked if they could add nutritiongoals, objectives, and support services to Vincent's Individual Education Program(IEP). His IEP team agreed that Vincent wouldn't benet from his special educationservices unless he was on the GFCF diet, so it was an educational need. This meantthat Special Education funds could be allocated to purchase gluten- and casein-freefoods for Vincent's school lunch and pay a consulting registered dietitian to reviewthe school menus and recommend modications. PROJECT NO. 8: IS YOUR CHILD A POSITIVE RESPONDER TO THE GFCF DIET? 1. Talk to a knowledgeable registered dietitian who can help you implement the GFCF diet. 2. Conduct a three-month elimination of gluten, casein, and soy, making sure to document your child's symptoms prior to and at the end of the elimination phase. List any specic symptom improvements.117 STEP 8: CONSIDER PUTTING YOUR CHILD ON A SPECIAL ELIMINATION DIET0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 1173. Challenge with soy rst, then casein, then gluten to determine if symptoms return. 4. If your child is a positive responder, continue to eliminate gluten, casein, and/or soy from his diet. Although they're not recommended by most medical professionals, special elimination diets continue to be very popular in the autism community. Until more science-basedresearch is available, parents will have to conduct a \"mini-experiment\" on their ownchildren to determine if the elimination of certain foods is benecial to them. I've hada lot of success with the GFCF diet and think it's worth your taking some time to con-sider trying it. Now it's time to move on to Step 9, which involves another controversial yet popular nutritional treatment in the autism community\u2014treating your child's symptoms witha very high dosage of vitamin B 6. 118 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 118STEP 9 Try High Dose Vitamin B 6with Magnesium People typically supplement their diet with vitamins as a way to ward off disease and prevent vitamin deciencies. The goal for using high-dose vitamins is completely dif-ferent. A high-dose vitamin regimen, also known as \"megavitamin therapy\" and \"ortho-molecular medicine,\" involves taking large amounts of a single, specic vitamin toachieve a particular health benet. For instance, high doses of niacin are used to treatmental disorders such as schizophrenia and hypercholesterolemia, and high doses of vi-tamin C are used to treat cancer and AIDS. In the autism community, a high dose ofvitamin B 6coupled with magnesium is the treatment of interest. It's important to point out that while complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners frequently use megavitamin therapy to treat a wide range of con-ditions, the mainstream medical community considers the practice poorly supportedby scientic research, ineffective, and potentially harmful and doesn't support it. MEGAVITAMIN THERAPY AND AUTISM The use of megavitamin therapy gained popularity in the autism community in the1960s, when the idea that daily high doses of vitamin B 6(pyridoxine) may benet autistic children was introduced. Today, high dose vitamin B6is the most popular megavitamin therapy used to treat the condition. Here's a list of benecial effects autis-tic children have reportedly experienced: \u0081 behavioral improvement \u0081 decreased aggression\u0081 fewer tantrums 1190738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 119\u0081 improved social responsiveness \u0081 less stimulatory behavior\u0081 increased speech\u0081 improved eye contact There have been more than a dozen research studies done on high dose vitamin B 6 treatment for autism, and many of them concluded that it benets up to half of autistic children. However, only a few of these research studies were double-blind, randomized,placebo-controlled trials, and many medical professionals believe that the studies werepoorly designed, biased, or had inadequate sample sizes. Additionally, the doses of vita-min B 6used in these research studies varied greatly, so it's still not clear what the appro- priate dosage to treat autism should be. A key nding of these research studies was that high doses of vitamin B6were effec- tive for improving autistic symptoms only when used in combination with magnesium.Magnesium is a mineral involved in more than three hundred biochemical reactions inthe body. It helps maintain normal nerve function, supports a healthy immune system,helps to regulate blood glucose levels, is involv ed in the synthesis of protein and energy production, and helps regulate blood pressure. Overall, the results of these studies suggest that high dose vitamin B 6with magne- sium may well be effective in improving certain characteristics of autism. WHY VITAMIN B6? The autism community has focused on vitamin B6as an avenue of treatment because of the role it plays in neurological function. Vitamin B6is a water-soluble vitamin that's es- sential to the synthesis of serotonin and dopamine, two key neurotransmitters in the brain. Serotonin plays an important role in the modulation of mood, anger, aggression, sleep, and appetite. Low levels of serotonin are associated with a susceptibility to de-pression, anxiety, aggression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Dopamine plays an important role in mood, sleep, motor activity, and behavior. It's critical for cognitive functions such as attention, learning, memory, and problem solv-ing. Dopamine is also involved in motivation and reward by signaling parts of the brainresponsible for learning to repeat behaviors that lead to reward. Low levels of dopaminehave been associated with autism, ADHD, schizophrenia, and social anxiety. In essence, high dose vitamin B 6is being used as a \"medication\" to naturally increase the production of serotonin and dopamine in the brain. This neurological connection120 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 120may explain why it's been effective in improving symptoms for some autistic children. Vitamin B6plays many roles within the body. It helps with the following: \u0081 creating neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine \u0081 forming and maintaining the central nervous system\u0081 aiding more than one hundred enzymes in the metabolism of protein\u0081 helping the immune system function properly\u0081 creating hemoglobin\u0081 maintaining blood glucose levels within a normal range\u0081 maintaining the health of lymphoid organs, such as the tonsils, adenoids, lymph nodes, and spleen DETERMINING THE RIGHT VITAMIN B6 DOSAGE FOR YOUR CHILD Unfortunately, there's no clear-cut dosage to which autistic children seem to respond. The amounts of B6used in the research studies I discussed earlier varied greatly. Theo- retically, since we are all biochemically unique, some autistic children may require ahigher dosage than others. This can be confusing when you're trying to gure out theright amount of B 6to use for your child. Typically, the amount of vitamin B6that health practitioners suggest using ex- ceeds both the RDA and the UL recommended by the USDA Food and NutritionBoard. B 6dosages can range from 200, 500, to even 1,000 mg per day. Many prac- titioners follow the guidelines set forth by the Autism Research Institute (ARI),which bases its suggestions on informal data collection from parents of autistic chil-dren (see www.autism.com for more information). According to the ARI, the aver-age amount of vitamin B 6found to be beneficial is 8 mg per pound of body weight per day. For example, a 35-pound child would take 280 mg of vitamin B6per day. Here are some additional ARI guidelines to follow as you start your child on a highdose B 6regimen: \u0081 Start at one quarter the total dosage and increase to the full dosage over a fourteen-day period of time. \u0081 If the high dose vitamin B6is effective, you should see the benets within a few days. 121 STEP 9: TRY HIGH DOSE VITAMIN B6WITH MAGNESIUM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 121\u0081 If you don't see any improvements within a month, the high dose vitamin B6 should be stopped. You also need to make sure your child is taking in an adequate amount of magne- sium along with the vitamin B6. The ARI suggests taking 3 to 4 mg of magnesium per pound of body weight per day up to a maximum of 400 mg per day in adults. For ex- ample, a 35-pound child would take 105 to 140 mg of magnesium per day in additionto his high dose B 6. PYRIDOXINE AND PYRIDOXAL 5-PHOSPHATE (P5P) ARE NOT THE SAME THING Please be careful not to confuse pyridoxine, also known as vitamin B6, with Pyridoxal 5-phosphate (P5P). P5P is the active form of pyridoxine\u2014the body has to convert pyridoxine to P5P in order to use it, and this conversion is dependent upon the miner-als magnesium and zinc. Some healthcare practitioners believe that autistic childrenmay have difculty converting pyridoxine to P5P , so they suggest using supplementalP5P or a combination of pyridoxine and P5P supplements. The supposed advantagesare that an autistic child wouldn't need to convert pyridoxine to P5P because he's tak-ing it in its active form, and its effectiveness wouldn't be compromised if he has a mag-nesium or zinc deciency. We know that supplemental P5P should be taken at a lowerdosage than pyridoxine, but no controlled studies have yielded an exact recommenda-tion for how much P5P should be used to replace pyridoxine. If you choose to do atrial response for high dose vitamin B 6, I recommend you use B6in the form of pyri- doxine, not P5P . CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY The major concern about taking any vitamin at a high dose is the potential for toxicity.When vitamin B 6is consumed through food sources, there are no adverse effects. How- ever, when taken in supplement form in high doses, toxicity can become an issue.There are no problems associated with short-term use, but when taken at high levels formonths or years, it may cause problems like sensory neuropathy, a condition charac-terized by numbness, tingling, and burning pain commonly in the hands, arms, feet,and legs. The adverse effects are reversible if the symptoms are identied and the highdose vitamin B 6supplementation is immediately stopped. 122 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 122Recognizing Adverse Effects It's highly unlikely that your child will develop a side effect such as sensory neuropathy. Still, you should learn to recognize the signs of a problem should it occur, especially ifyour child is nonverbal. If your child demonstrates any of the following symptoms,take him off the high dose B 6immediately: \u0081 shakes his hands \u0081 wrenches his hands\u0081 increases hand stimming\u0081 walks on his tiptoes Diarrhea is a potential side effect of taking excessive magnesium in supplement form, so many practitioners suggest limiting the amount of magnesium in supplements to the UL.

Food and Nutrition Board, National Academy of Sciences, Institute of Medicine DECIDING IF HIGH DOSE VITAMIN B6IS RIGHT FOR YOUR CHILD There's no test to determine if your child will benet from high dose vitamin B6. The only way to know if it will benet your child is to try it. If you do decide to move for-ward, I strongly encourage you to enlist the help of a registered dietitian or nutrition-oriented physician before starting. Discussing the pros and cons of a high dosevitamin B 6regimen with the appropriate medical professional is the best way to make a fully informed decision for your child. The medical professional can also help youselect an appropriate product, proper dosage, conduct a safe trial response, determineif B 6is effective or not, and decide if the high dose vitamin B6should be continued or not. 123 STEP 9: TRY HIGH DOSE VITAMIN B6WITH MAGNESIUM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 123There's great debate over the effectiveness of high dose vitamin B6with magnesium to treat autism among healthcare practitioners. Organizations such as the Autism Re- search Institute (ARI) and physicians practicing complementary and alternative medi-cine advocate for its use, but very few conventional physicians and even fewerregistered dietitians support it. Since a growing number of parents are using high dosevitamin B 6to treat their child's autistic symptoms, this means that many of them are doing so without the approval of their physician or help from a registered dietitian. Irmly believe that if a parent chooses to try their child on high dose vitamin B 6, they should not be left to go through the process alone. If you nd yourself in this position,I urge you to nd a doctor and/or dietitian who will support your decision, so you cansafely conduct a trial response for your child with medical supervision. CONDUCTING A TRIAL RESPONSE When I work with parents who want to try their child on high dose vitamin B6, I have them conduct a one-month trial response to determine whether their child is a positiveresponder. A trial response is basically a \"mini-experiment\" designed to gather objectiveinformation so you can make an informed decision about whether your child benetsfrom high dose vitamin B 6. This means it's very important that you remain objective, systematic, and observant and document all results. Here's the procedure: 1. Choose a medical professional to help you. 2. With the medical professional, select a high dose vitamin B6supplement product. 3. Jointly decide on the full dosage of vitamin B6per day, the amount to initially start with, and how much to increase weekly to reach the full dosage. 4. Make sure your child is consuming at least the RDA for magnesium in a supplement. 5. You and your child's caregivers, therapists, and teachers should document his symptoms prior to starting the high dose vitamin B6(known as baseline data). Current symptoms to document should include your child's communication skills, social interaction, behavior, stereotyped activities, sleep, bed wetting, hyperactivity, focus, attention, feeding problems, and bowel function.124 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 1246. Begin the high dose vitamin B6. 7. You and your child's caregivers, therapists, and teachers should document his symptoms on a weekly basis. This is known as response data, and it's impor- tant because many autistic children have a positive response to B6at a lower dosage and don't require the full dosage. 8. Gradually increase your child's dosage weekly until you reach the full dosage; continue the trial response for approximately two more weeks once the fulldosage is reached. 9. You and your child's caregivers, therapists, and teachers should separately eval- uate your documented observations (evaluation data) and determine if thehigh dose was benecial for your child. 10. You and the medical professional you're working with should assess all the data collected on your child and decide whether the high dose vitamin B 6should be continued. See Appendix 5 for examples of baseline, response, and evaluationforms that you can use to document your child's symptoms and response. If, after comparing all the data, you conclude that the high dose vitamin B 6had no benecial effects or actually made your child's symptoms worse, take him off it. If you determine that the high dose vitamin B6resulted in substantial improvement and/or improvement in one or more of your child's symptoms, it may be benecial forhim and you may want to continue the regimen. If you conclude that the vitamin B 6resulted in a combination of positive and nega- tive results, discuss with your medical professional and decide whether or not high dosevitamin B 6should be continued. If you decide your child should continue the high dose vitamin B6, I suggest you have him reassessed after six months. The truth is that it's impossible to be 100 percent sureyour child is a positive responder because of all the other therapies he may be undergo-ing at the same time he began his B 6regimen. At the six-month mark you should con- duct a second trial response, which involves stopping the high dose vitamin B6and watching for the return of any of your child's symptoms. If you don't see any symptomregression, then the high dose vitamin B 6may not be benecial after all and can be dis- continued. On the other hand, if his symptoms do regress, then the high dose vitaminB 6is likely benecial and should be continued. If you decide to continue the high dose125 STEP 9: TRY HIGH DOSE VITAMIN B6WITH MAGNESIUM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 125vitamin B6beyond six months, be sure to tell your child's doctor that he's on a thera- peutic level of vitamin B6and watch for signs of sensory neuropathy. Many autistic children take Super Nu Thera, which is a daily multivitamin and min- eral supplement that also contains a high dose of vitamin B6. It's available in caplets, powder, and liquid form and with or without vitamins A and D. Please note that if you try Super Nu Thera and your child's one month trial response indicates that vitamin B6 isn't benecial to him, you'll need to replace the Super Nu Thera with a basic multivit-amin and mineral supplement. Super Nu Thera is distributed by Kirkman, and you canvisit www.kirkmangroup.com for information on this product. Maria's Story Maria is a good example of a patient of mine who had a positive response to high dose vitamin B6. Maria was four years old and diagnosed with autism. She was considered high functioning and received therapy through an Early ChildhoodProgram at her local public school. Her mother told me that Maria was easilyfrustrated, flapped her arms when overwhelmed, retreated into her own world,avoided eye contact, and had delayed speech. Based on Maria's body weight of 32 pounds, the suggested high dose vitamin B 6 dosage was approximately 250 mg per day (8 mg vitamin B6per pound of body weight). The suggested magnesium dose was approximately 96-128 mg per day(3-4 mg magnesium per pound of body weight). Maria's parents purchased vitaminB 6in 50 mg pull-apart capsules so the powder could be mixed into soft food. Her daily multivitamin and mineral supplement contained an adequate amount ofmagnesium, so a magnesium supplement wasn't necessary. Before starting the one-month trial response of high dose vitamin B 6, Maria's parents, teacher, and therapists completed the Baseline Data form on page 234 to document her existing symptoms.The high dose vitamin B 6was started at 50 mg per day, and increased by 50 mg increments every two or three days until the full dosage of 250 mg was reached intwo weeks. The Response Data form was completed at the end of each week tomonitor her progress. At the end of the one-month trial response, the Evaluation Dataform was lled out to assess whether the high dose vitamin B 6was benecial. Everyone agreed that Maria had notable improvement in eye contact, wasn't aseasily frustrated, and demonstrated less arm flapping after starting the high dosevitamin B 6, so it was continued. Six months later, Maria underwent another trial response. This time the high dose vitamin B6was gradually decreased in 50 mg126 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 126increments over two weeks, to determine if Maria's symptoms would regress without the high dose vitamin B6. Maria's parents, teacher, and therapists again observed, documented her symptoms, and noted that Maria did regress when the high dosevitamin B 6was decreased. Maria's parents felt the high dose vitamin B6was benecial, chose to continue it, and informed Maria's physician of their decision. PROJECT NO. 9: IS YOUR CHILD A POSITIVE RESPONDER TO HIGH DOSE VITAMIN B 6? 1. With the help of a medical professional, calculate the proper vitamin B6dosage for your child and choose a product (either Super Nu Thera or a simple B6 supplement). 2. Calculate the proper dosage of magnesium that should accompany the B6. 3. Record your child's baseline symptoms (see form in Appendix 5). 4. Initiate the trial response and document his response data (see form in Appendix 5). 5. At the end of one month, evaluate all the data you've collected and see if he's shown any symptom improvement. If so, your child is a positive responder to a high dose vitamin B6regimen. High dose vitamin B6isn't the only nutrient used in advanced nutritional interven- tions to treat autism. Many other vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, and nu-traceuticals are also suggested for autistic children, and we tackle those in the nal stepof this program. 127 STEP 9: TRY HIGH DOSE VITAMIN B6WITH MAGNESIUM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 127STEP 10 Explore Additional Supplements There are many other vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, amino acids, nutraceuticals, and herbs believed to benet autistic children. These supplements are accepted andcommonly used as advanced nutritional treatment in the autism community. Before we get started, it's important to understand that each of these advanced nu- tritional supplementations serves a very specic purpose, and not every autistic childneeds them. Some autistic children will use most of them, other children only a fewsupplements, and still others should not try any advanced supplements because theyaren't appropriate for their individual conditions. Also, contrary to what many med-ical practitioners tell parents, you should notstart your child on all of these supple- ments at once, nor should they all be used at the same time. Many parents end uppurchasing dozens of expensive supplements and try to get their child to take all ofthese supplements every day, which never works. Doing so will only make you feelfrustrated, overwhelmed, and totally disillusioned with all nutritional interventions.T reating autism is like running a marathon\u2014you need to start slowly and pace your-self. Work with your child's registered dietitian or nutrition-oriented physician to g-ure out which advanced supplements, if any, might be appropriate for your child.Lastly, do not even attempt to implement this step until your child has mastered therst nine steps of my program. His basic nutrition must be in place before you delveinto more advanced interventions. ADVANCED SUPPLEMENTS Since there are so many advanced supplements to consider, it's easiest to group themtogether by their intended purpose. Some supplements are used to enhance the detoxi- 1280738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 128cation or immune systems, some to enhance cognitive function, and others to improve behavioral or other autistic symptoms. You'll quickly see which groups of sup-plements may be appropriate to treat your child's individual symptoms. Please notethat the groupings are not all-inclusive but rather a general guideline to help you start adiscussion with your child's registered dietitian or physician. A few of these supple-ments are considered controversial and are not recommended by some medical profes-sionals. You'll need to work with someone who's willing to have open discussions aboutall of these supplements so you can make a well-informed decision regarding their usefor your child. Supplements to Enhance Cognitive Function The following supplements are used because of their ability to enhance a child's com-prehension, reasoning, decision making, planning, term for the compounds L-carnitine, acetyl-L-carnitine, andpropionyl-L-carnitine. It's synthesized in the body from the essential amino acids lysineand methionine. Carnitine plays a critical role in energy production, transporting long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria so they can be burned to produce energy. It then transports waste out of the cell to prevent waste accumulation. Carnitine mayalso have brain and central nervous system protection abilities, cardio protective activ-ity, triglyceride-lowering effects, and antioxidant properties. One research study hassuggested that 50 percent of boys with ADD have a positive response to L-carnitine supplements. A deciency in carnitine can cause your child to have muscle weakness, hypo- glycemia, and elevated blood-ammonia concentrations. Carnitine deciencies can becaused by valproic acid, which is a medication used to treat seizures, as well as some an-tibiotics. There's also a genetic disorder called primary carnitine deciency , which manifests by ve years of age, in which a child's carnitine transporters don't work prop-erly. I recommend that you ask your child's physician to order a carnitine blood test todetermine if he has a deciency and needs supplementation. The following are carni-tine-rich foods:129 STEP 10: EXPLORE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 129meat (the redder the meat, the higher the carnitine content) sh poultry To determine if your child may benet from carnitine supplementation, you should do a trial response under the supervision of his doctor. (See page 124 in Step 9 for a re- fresher on how to conduct a trial response. You'll nd trial response forms in Appendix5 that you can use to document your child's symptoms and response to carnitine.) Beon the lookout for symptoms of excess carnitine, such as nausea, vomiting, abdominalcramps, and diarrhea. Carnitine is available by prescription under the brand name Car-nitor and the generic levocarnitine and over-the-counter in the form of L-carnitine andacetyl-L-carnitine. There is currently no RDA for carnitine. For dosage recommenda-tions for over-the-counter carnitine, refer to the for Nutritional Supplements. Choline Choline is a water-soluble nutrient that the body needs to make several importantcompounds necessary for healthy cell membranes. It's a component of phosphatidyl-choline (lecithin) and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which is one of the crucialbrain chemicals involved in memory. Choline is also a precursor for the methyl donortrimethylglycine (TMG). A few reports indicate that choline can improve short-termmemory skills and enhance memory in poor learners. The Food and Nutrition Boardof the National Academy of Sciences recommends that pregnant and nursing womenincrease their intake of choline to help ensure normal fetal brain development. TheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that infant formula containcholine. There's currently no RDA for choline, but the Food and Nutrition Board ofthe Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences has established Ade-quate Intakes, which are listed in Appendix 3. The following are choline-rich foods: organ meats pork nuts egg yolks sh beans beef poultry peanut butter soy protein powder cauliflower Brussels sprouts Too much supplemental choline has been reported to cause nausea, diarrhea, and loose stools. Supplemental choline comes in several different forms, and I recommend130 EATING FOR AUTISM milk dairy products (in the whey component)0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 130that you stay away from choline in the form of choline bitartrate. There are indications that it may increase symptoms of depression. Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10is a fat-soluble substance that belongs to a family of substances called ubiquinones. CoQ10has antioxidant properties that protect the central nervous sys- tem and the brain from neurodegenerative diseases. Since CoQ10is recognized as such an important antioxidant for the brain, it's commonly added to daily multivitamin andmineral supplements. Check your child's daily supplement to see if he's already gettingCoQ 10. If so, an additional supplement isn't necessary. If you do decide to try your child on a CoQ10supplement, discuss dosage with your child's registered dietitian or physician, as there's no RDA for CoQ10. For dosage recommendations, I refer to the PDR for Nuttritional Supplements. Excess amounts of CoQ10can cause your child to experience mild gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, and indigestion.The following are CoQ 10-rich foods: meat sh nutspoultry soybean oil canola oil Iron Iron is an essential trace mineral that's critical to your child's brain function. Ittransports oxygen to cells throughout the body, helps produce carnitine, and is in-volved in the production of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norep-inephrine. Iron is also important to your child's immune function, increasing hisresistance to disease and infections. If your child is suffering from an iron defi-ciency ,it can prevent his brain cells from getting the proper amount of oxygen, which can result in compromised mental function, apathy, short attention span, ir-ritability, decreased ability to learn, and impaired school performance. He may alsobe more vulnerable to Candida, viruses, and other pathogens. There are several rou-tine blood tests, such as the serum ferritin, total iron binding capacity , hemoglo- bin and hematocrit tests, that can identify whether your child has even a mild caseof iron deficiency anemia. Research studies show that when children with iron defi-ciency anemia take an iron supplement, their cognitive skills improve and theirlearning problems diminish. Since iron is so critical to your child's health, it should already be included in his daily diet through food or a multivitamin and mineral supplement. The following areiron-rich foods:131 STEP 10: EXPLORE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 131organ meats beans tofu red meat soybeans spinach sh lentils peas poultry blackstrap molasses raisins If your child doesn't have an iron deciency and is already getting 100 percent of his RDA for iron, I don't suggest giving him an additional supplement. If too much iron builds up in the body, it can lead to the formation of harmful free radicals that damagecells and contribute to cancer. If tests show your child does suffer from an iron deciencyand requires iron supplementation beyond his RDA, a physician should prescribe it. Taking too much iron at one time is toxic and can have serious consequences, such as the following: vomiting renal failure lethargy diarrhea shock hypoglycemia central nervous coma liver damage system depression It's extremely important to keep iron supplements in a childproof bottle and away from children. You can nd your child's RDA and Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL)for iron in Appendix 3. Zinc Zinc is an essential mineral involved in the activity of more than one hundred enzymesin the body. Perhaps most importantly, zinc is required for the development and activa-tion of T-lymphocytes, which are the white blood cells that ght infection. Like iron,it's important for your child's growth and development and should already be includedin his daily diet through food or a multivitamin and mineral supplement. A zinc de-ciency can result in immune dysfunction, growth retardation, loss of appetite, diarrhea,and mental lethargy. Even a moderate zinc deciency will negatively affect your child'simmune system. (Too much zinc will also impair your child's immune function.) Thefollowing is a list of zinc-rich foods: oysters and some other types of seafood beans poultry fortied breakfast cereals nuts dairy products red meat whole grains You can nd your child's RDA and UL for zinc in Appendix 3. 132 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 132SUPPLEMENTS TO ENHANCE THE IMMUNE Selenium\u0081 Vitamin A\u0081 Vitamin C By now you know that many medical professionals within the autism community believe that autistic children are more prone to immune system dysfunction than other children. Physicians who treat autism with alternative and complementary interven-tions often recommend controversial treatments such as intravenous immune globu- lin (IVIG), oral immunoglobulin (OIG) , transfer factors, and antiviral, antifungal, and antibacterial medications. Many parents prefer to play it safe by sticking with vita-mins, minerals, and nutrients that naturally enhance their child's immune system. Yourchild's registered dietitian can help you ensure he's getting enough iron, magnesium, se-lenium, zinc, and vitamins A, C, D, and E through food and/or a daily multivitaminand mineral supplement. Your child should be taking in at least his RDA but shouldnot exceed his UL. Dimethylglycine (DMG) Dimethylglycine is a water-soluble substance found naturally in animal and plant cells.Animal research indicates that DMG may support the immune system. Some foodsthat are rich in dimethlyglycine are beans, cereal grain, and liver. The PDR for Nutri-tional Supplements suggest the typical dose is 125 mg per day. DMG is nontoxic, andno adverse reactions have been reported. In the autism community, many have reported that DMG can improve an autistic child's behavior, eye contact, and expressive language. Unfortunately, the three smallresearch studies that have been conducted on DMG and autism don't support this.Still, parents continue to try DMG with their autistic children, and it remains one ofthe most popular supplements. If you are interested in trying DMG to enhance yourchild's expressive language, you can check the Autism Research Institute Web site fordosage suggestions for your child. I encourage you to first talk with his registered dietitian or physician before starting a trial response to determine if he's a positive re-sponder to DMG.133 STEP 10: EXPLORE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 133David's Story Five-year-old David was diagnosed with autism. He made little eye contact, repeated words in place of normal language, lined up toys, had numerous tantrumsand behavioral problems, was easily frustrated, and had difculty falling andstaying asleep at night. David's mother said he had developmental delays sincebirth. He'd had frequent ear infections as an infant that were treated with numerousrounds of antibiotics. He suffered with loose stools, was gaseous, and never hadnormal formed bowel movements. He also had a history of frequent illnesses suchas colds, bronchitis, and pneumonia. David refused to eat any fruits or vegetablesand consumed a very limited variety of foods. An IgE RAST allergy test indicatedthat he was allergic to egg white, but eggs hadn't been eliminated from his diet.The only supplement David was taking was a liquid baby vitamin supplement.David's parents had not tried any nutritional interventions or dietary changes beforeconsulting with me. I had the opportunity to work with David over several months and help his parents implement the entire 10-Step Nutrition Plan. His parents were eager to get startedand quickly completed steps 1 and 2. The entire family transitioned to consuminghealthier, whole, organic foods and avoided foods with trans fat, excess sugar, andrened carbohydrates. David's parents made sure he was consuming adequateprotein, healthy fats, complex carbohydrates, and ltered water on a daily basis.Step 3 and 4 were quickly and easily achieved by replacing the liquid baby vitaminsupplement with a children's daily multivitamin and mineral supplement and startingDavid on an omega-3 fatty acid supplement. To address his refusal of fruits andvegetables and his limited food repertoire, David began feeding therapy at a privateout-patient feeding clinic (Step 5). Since he had gastrointestinal problems, weinitiated the gut healing program (Step 6) using probiotics, digestive enzymes, andantifungals, which resolved his runny, loose stools. We knew that David might beallergic to egg white, so we conducted an elimination/challenge diet (Step 7) todetermine if he had any negative reactions. He didn't, so eggs were allowed toremain in his diet. Then we began to transition David to the GFCF diet (Step 8). Soonhe no longer had sleep problems and his excess gas and bowel problems wereresolved, so the GFCF diet was continued. David's parents were interested in howDavid would respond to high dose vitamin B 6(Step 9), so we conducted a one- month trial response. It was determined that David was not a positive responder, 134 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 134and the high dose vitamin B6was discontinued. After completing steps 1 through 9, David had signicant improvements in his bowel function, sleep, behavior, feeding problem, and overall autistic symptoms. David's parents wanted to begin Step 10 and address some of the individual issues impacting David. We first considered trying additional nutritionalsupplements to enhance his immune system, since he had a history of frequentillness. David's frequent illnesses were a serious concern for his parents becauseduring the winter months David was always sick, missed an extensive number ofdays from school, and regressed academically. He also missed out on criticalspeech and occupational therapy sessions, which slowed down his progress. I assessed David's diet and vitamin and mineral supplement to make sure he was getting at least 100 percent of his RDA for the nutrients critical for immunefunction\u2014iron, magnesium, selenium, zinc and vitamins A, D, and E. I alsosuggested an additional supplement of 200 mg vitamin C and 125 mgdimethylglycine (DMG) to support the immune system. David's mother reported that this was the first winter during which he didn't suffer from any colds orbronchitis and wasn't hospitalized for pneumonia. She was thrilled that David wasable to get through the entire winter without getting sick, being absent from school,and missing speech and occupational therapy sessions. Magnesium Magnesium plays a role in more than three hundred biochemical reactions in the body. Its numerous functions include supporting the immune system, helping to buildbones, regulating blood sugar levels, protein synthesis, energy metabolism, maintainingnormal nerve function, and regulating heart rhythm. If your child isn't getting enoughmagnesium, he may experience a loss of appetite, confusion, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue,and muscle weakness. Here are some magnesium-rich foods: halibut beans banana milk nuts peas avocado seeds whole unrened grains Taking too much magnesium in supplement form often causes diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal cramping. Appendix 3 shows your child's RDA and UL for magnesium.135 STEP 10: EXPLORE ADDITIONAL 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 135Selenium Selenium is a trace mineral that the body requires only in very small amounts. Its most important role is as an antioxidant that helps prevent cellular damage caused by freeradicals. Selenium also helps support the immune system, regulate thyroid function,protect against some cancers, and rid the body of heavy metals by forming an inactivecomplex with these metals. If your child suffers from a selenium deciency, it canweaken his immune system, cause hypothyroidism, spur the development of heart dis-ease, and increase his risk of some cancers. If your child has a gastrointestinal problemsuch as chronic diarrhea and inflammation, he has an increased risk for selenium de-ciency because his body is less able to absorb it. The following are selenium-rich foods: brazil nuts cod eggs enriched bread tuna turkey oatmeal beef chicken rice Taking too much selenium can result in selenosis, the symptoms of which include irritability, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, garliclike breath, hair loss, and white, blotchynails. See Appendix 3 for your child's RDA and UL for selenium. Vitamin A Vitamin A is actually a group of fat-soluble substances. Preformed vitamin A , or vita- min A that occurs in a form ready to be used by the body, is found in animal sources.Carotenoids are found in plant sources and must be converted to vitamin A. (You've probably heard of beta carotene, which is the most common carotenoid.) Vitamin A iscritical to the proper functioning of the immune system. It's involved in making whiteblood cells, which destroy harmful bacteria and viruses. Vitamin A also plays a majorrole in vision, brain development, growth, and bone development, and its antioxidantproperties may help prevent cancer. If your child has a vitamin A deciency, it will com-promise his immune system and make him susceptible to many types of infection. Evena mild deciency can cause a loss of appetite, decreased growth rate, slow bone develop-ment, and night blindness. Some foods that are rich in preformed vitamin A are: liver egg yolk cream whole milk sh liver oils butter fortied skim milk Here are some carotenoid-rich foods:carrots kale apricots mango peas tomatoes spinach cantaloupe papaya pepper136 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 136Too much vitamin A can result in hypervitaminosis A , a condition where high lev- els of the vitamin are stored within the body. This excess of vitamin A can be toxic and cause reactions such as nausea, vomiting, headache, muscular uncoordination, reducedbone density, liver damage, and birth defects. Hypervitaminosis A typically occurs onlywhen taking preformed vitamin A supplements. T urn to Appendix 3 to nd yourchild's RDA and UL for vitamin A. Vitamin C Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that performs a variety of important functions. Ithelps support the immune system; in fact, several research studies indicate that vitamin Cdecreases the incidence, duration, and severity of the common cold. Its antioxidant prop-erties help prevent chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and cataracts caused byoxidative damage. Vitamin C increases the body's ability to absorb iron, heal wounds, andprotects against asthma. Vitamin C is a cofactor in the carnitine transport system and theconversion of tryptophan to serotonin, and it preserves intracellular glutathione concen-trations. It also plays a major role in the detoxication system, helping the body get rid ofpesticides and heavy metals. Research indicates that high serum levels of ascorbic acid(the major dietary form of vitamin C) are associated with a decreased incidence of highblood lead levels. One research study indicated that ascorbic acid had chelating propertiescomparable to EDTA, a lead-chelating agent, and is equally able to lower blood-lead lev-els. (See the section about Chelation Therapy on page 140 for more on this topic). If your child is vitamin C deficient, his wounds may not heal as quickly, he may have a lower resistance to colds and infections, and he may be more susceptible to avariety of chronic diseases. In severe instances, scurvy can occur, which causes bleed-ing gums, loosened teeth, muscle weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite, diarrhea, pul-monary problems, and kidney problems. Here are some vitamin C-rich foods: orange juice tomato juice oranges cantaloupe Brussels sprouts cabbage broccolistrawberries asparagus collard greensgreen peas potatoes pineapple Since excess vitamin C is excreted in the urine, your child can consume large amounts without risk to his health. However, large doses for an extended period of time sometimes result in problems such as nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, anddiarrhea. You can find your child's RDA and UL for vitamin C in Appendix 3. Forsuggested dosages to enhance the immune and detoxification systems, his dietitianmay refer to the PDF for Nutritional Supplements.137 STEP 10: EXPLORE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 137In the autism community, vitamin C gained attention because emerging research showed that magadoses of vitamin C had a positive effect on the behavior of autistic children. If you are interested in conducting a trial response of high dose vitamin Cto see if your child is a positive responder, be sure to discuss dosage with your child'sregistered dietitian or physician. Vitamin D Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that aids in the absorption of calcium and phospho-rus, helping to form and maintain strong bones and teeth. Vitamin D supports the im-mune system by boosting natural killer cells . Recent research suggests vitamin D may provide protection from certain cancers, type I and type II diabetes, glucose intoler-ance, high blood pressure, cochlear deafness, and multiple sclerosis. There's also specu-lation that it plays a role in modulating mood by affecting serotonin levels in the brain.In children, vitamin D deciency causes rickets, which results in skeletal deformities,soft bones, muscle weakness, and delayed development of teeth. Deciencies are mostoften found in children who follow a milk-free or strict vegetarian diet. Some foodsthat are rich in vitamin D are (note: Vitamin D is also produced by our bodies whenour skin is exposed to sunlight): cod liver oil sardines eggs salmon fortied milk liver mackerel fortied margarine cheese tuna sh ready-to-eat cereals Too much vitamin D can result in symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, weakness, weight loss, constipation, poor appetite, headache, and confusion, though this is un-likely to occur from eating vitamin D food sources. Toxicity is more likely to occurfrom taking too much of a supplement, such as cod liver oil. Appendix 3 lists yourchild's RDA and UL for vitamin D. Vitamin E Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that exists in eight different forms, with alpha- tocopherol the most active form. It works to support the immune system and has power- ful antioxidant properties that protect cells against the damaging effects of free radicalsthat may contribute to chronic diseases and cancer. Its antioxidant properties also work toprotect the brain and central nervous system. A vitamin E deciency can result in periph-138 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 138eral neuropathy (the degeneration of nerves in the hands and feet) and increase the risk of cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and heart disease. Even the slightest vitamin E deciency canimpair your child's immune function. Here are some vitamin E-rich foods: wheat germ vegetable oils nuts and seeds green leafy vegetables Too much vitamin E isn't toxic, but since it acts as an anticoagulant, taking an excess amount can increase the risk of prolonged bleeding. Appendix 3 lists your child's RDAand UL for vitamin E. SUPPLEMENTS TO ENHANCE Vitamin C Many people in the autism community also believe that autistic children have a dys- functional detoxification system within their liver. The theory goes that an autisticchild's liver can't effectively excrete toxins such as mercury, lead, arsenic, pesticides,herbicides, certain solvents, other chemicals. Toxins that aren't excreted can crossthe blood-brain barrier, cling to brain tissue, and damage the brain; therefore autisticchildren are more vulnerable to neurological damage caused by exposure to these tox-ins. Neurotoxin chemicals are particularly dangerous to the rapidly developing brainof a fetus, infant, and young child. Exposure to neurotoxins at these vulnerable timesmay result in learning disabilities, attention deficit, hyperactivity, impulsiveness, ag-gressive behavior, speech delay, lower I.Q., and mental retardation. To learn moreabout neurotoxins and the impact they can have on your child, I recommend youread the report \"In Harm's Way: Toxic Threats to Child Development,\" which youcan find at www.igc.org/psr .This excellent resource discusses the environmental fac- tors that contribute to learning, behavioral, and developmental disabilities in ourchildren. 139 STEP 10: EXPLORE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 139Chelation Therapy Physicians who use alternative and complementary interventions to treat autism often recommend a highly controversial treatment called chelation therapy. In chelationtherapy, a drug that binds to heavy metals in the blood, such as EDTA, DMSA, orDMPS, is infused intravenously into your help eliminate toxins throughurine and stool. Chelation therapy is typically used to treat mercury and leadpoisoning that involves life-threatening high levels; not chronic, low-level exposure totoxins. This treatment method is controversial because little scientic research hasbeen done to establish its effectiveness to treat autism, and it may pose serious risksto your child. Chelation therapy can lead to mineral depletion, the rupture of bloodcells, liver damage, and bone marrow suppression. Some children have diedbecause of medication errors. If you decide to try chelation therapy, your child'skidney and liver function and blood composition has to be closely monitored toavoid potential damage. The effects of chronic, low-level exposure to multiple toxic chemicals on your child should be taken seriously, but I recommend you consider a less controversialtreatment. Vitamins, minerals, sulfur-containing amino acids, nutraceuticals, anddietary modications can all work to naturally enhance your child's detoxicationsystem. Turn to Appendix 6 on page 237 for my comprehensive nutritional plan toenhance detoxication, which includes reducing exposure to toxins, following aprotective diet, and choosing nutrients to support your child's detoxication function. Alpha-Lipoic Acid Alpha-lipoic acid is a disulde compound found in plant and animal sources. It func- tions as an antioxidant, helps the immune system, and may have anti-aging effects. Alpha-lipoic acid plays a critical role in the detoxication system as a precursor to L-cysteine and recycler of glutathione , an important antioxidant that helps eliminate toxins from the body. In fact, alpha-lipoic acid actually has the ability to increase glu- tathione levels in the body. Here are some alpha-lipoic acid-rich foods: organ meats broccoli Brussels sprouts spinach peas tomatoes There's been no report of adverse reactions to taking too much alpha-lipoic acid. Still, you should consult with your child's registered dietitian or physician for dosagerecommendations. I suggest dosages suggested in the PDR for National Supplements.140 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 140Glutathione Glutathione is a tripeptide made within the body from the amino acids cysteine, gluta- mate, and glycine. As I mentioned above, glutathione is critical for your child's detoxica-tion system. It's a cofactor for the glutathione S-transferase enzymes involved in thedetoxication of chemical toxins. It also functions as an antioxidant and helps the im-mune system work properly. Glutathione in supplement form is not well-absorbed in thegastrointestinal tract, so it's not usually recommended as an oral supplement. The wayaround this problem is to take the precursors\u2014that is, the molecules the body needs tomake glutathione\u2014rather than glutathione itself. The major precursors of glutathione areL-cysteine and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), both of which are available in supplement form.The glutathione precursor cysteine is found in high-protein foods such as the following: beef turkey whey protein milk pork eggs chicken There've been no reports of adverse reactions to taking too much glutathione orally. However, medical professionals advise using caution with L-cysteine supplements becauseno long-term safety studies have been done. In fact, most medical practitioners suggestthat children avoid L-cysteine in supplement form. NAC is the preferred supplement forboth adults and children because the body absorbs it better than glutathione. NAC sup-plements can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and rashes. If you're interestedin supplementing your child with NAC, it's crucial that you discuss dosage with his regis-tered dietitian or physician, who may refer to the PDR for National Supplements. Trimethylglycine (TMG) T rimethylglycine, also known as betaine , is a water-soluble substance related to choline. An important function of TMG is its ability to donate a methyl group and convert hom-cysteine to methionine, which is then converted to S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe). SAMe may have a positive effect on mood, emotional well-being, and depression. SAMemay also play a role in detoxication by increasing glutathione levels in the liver. (Pleasenote: SAMe in supplement form is not recommended for use in children.) TMG worksclosely with other methyl donors, such as choline, folic acid, vitamin B 12, and SAMe, and it plays an important role in the production of carnitine. Once TMG has donated amethyl group, it becomes DMG, which has also been identied as having potential posi-tive benets in autistic children (see page 133 for more on DMG). T rimethylglycine canbe found in foods such as sugar beets, spinach, wheat, and shellsh. There are no reports of adverse reactions to a TMG overdose, but some people have reported experiencing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Experts estimate that people who141 STEP 10: EXPLORE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 141eat a regular diet that contains whole wheat and seafood get approximately 100-1,000 mg of TMG per day, so if you want to conduct a trial response of supplemental TMG, Isuggest basing your child's dosage amount on what's found in a typical diet. I also en-courage you to discuss specic dosages for your child with his dietitian or physician. OTHER SUPPLEMENTS supplements have generated a lot of interest in the autism community, as many parents and medical practitioners have found them benecial for autistic chil-dren. If you're interested in trying your child on one or more of these supplements, doa one-month trial response to determine if he's a positive responder or not. If you ndthe supplement isn't helping your child, stop giving it to him. Carnosine Carnosine is a dipeptide (a combination of two amino acids\u2014alanine and histidine)that's highly concentrated in brain and muscle tissue. It functions as a powerful antiox-idant, protecting the body from free radicals, and also plays a part in neurotransmis-sion. It's sold as a supplement under the name L-carnosine. An eight-week researchstudy in 2002 published in the Journal of Child Neurology reported that children with autism who were supplemented with 400 mg of L-carnosine twice a day showed im-provement in behavior, socialization, communication, and an increase in their languagecomprehension. Carnosine can be found in meat, poultry, and sh. Too much L-carnosine can result in irritability, hyperactivity, and insomnia. If you want to try your child on an L-carnosine supplement, you should do so only undermedical supervision. Flavonoid Flavonoid, or bioflavonoid, refers to a class of compounds found in plants. They areknown most commonly for their antioxidant properties, but recent research has shownthat flavonoids also have anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-allergic, and anti-inflammatoryproperties. The treat autism is oligomeric proantho-cyanidins (OPC) . It's thought to improve the symptoms of ADHD, but there have been few research studies done to substantiate this belief. Flavonoids can be found incitrus fruits, berries, tea, ginkgo biloba, red wine, and dark chocolate. Only a small amount of flavonoid is necessary for health benefits. Taking too much in a dietary supplement not only provides no additional benefit; it may actu-ally be harmful. If you want to see if supplemental OPC improves your child's142 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 142ADHD symptoms, talk to his registered dietitian or physician about dosage before starting a one-month trial-response. Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12in the form of methylcobalamin, also known as methyl-B12, has become a very popular supplemental nutritional intervention for autism. It's theorized that autisticchildren may have abnormalities in their methylation pathways, which affect their bodies'ability to maintain the myelin sheath (the layer of insulation covering the axon of nervecells in the brain) and produce neurotransmitters. Vitamin B 12, folic acid, and vitamin B6 (in the form of pyridoxal 5 phosphate) work in conjunction with each other to converthomocysteine to methionine, which is then converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe). SAMe is the major methyl group donor in methylation reactions. Since vitaminB 12is a key cofactor in methylation, large doses of the vitamin may help correct abnor- malities in your child's methylation pathway. Vitamin B12is difcult for the body to absorb through the gastrointestinal tract. Those who have a gastrointestinal disorder, an intrinsic factor deciency, low hydrochloric acidin the stomach, bacterial overgrowth in the small intestines, parasites, an inflammatorybowel disorder, or gastrointestinal problems such as chronic diarrhea and inflammationhave even greater trouble absorbing B 12and are particularly at risk for a deciency. If your child has a B12deciency, he may experience symptoms such as weight loss, loss of ap- petite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, and a burning sensation in his tonguecalled glossitis . He may also experience cognitive changes and memory loss. Vitamin B 12 can be found in egg yolks, clams, oysters, crabs, sardines, salmon, and fortied cereals. Unlike the other supplements I've discussed, methyl-B12is administered by injection to maximize absorption within the body. There have been anecdotal reports of remark-able improvements in autistic children taking methyl-B 12injections, but so far there's been no supporting evidence from published research studies. If you want your child totry a trial response of high dosage methyl-B 12injections, discuss it rst with his physician. Supplements Can Be Toxic It's extremely difcult to take in too much of a vitamin or mineral through diet alone, but supplements are a different story. To avoid the risk of toxicity, do not exceed yourchild's UL for a particular vitamin or mineral unless his registered dietitian orphysician recommends it and is monitoring his progress. Also, make sure that anypotential adverse reactions are clearly explained to you. 143 STEP 10: EXPLORE ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS0738212432_1.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:27 PM Page 143PROJECT NO. 10 1. As you read through this chapter, make a list of the supplements that might benet your child based on his symptoms. 2. Take your list to your child's registered dietitian or physician and discuss which supplements are appropriate for him. Here's a list of questions I suggest you ask regarding the supplements I discuss in this chapter: \u0081 Which of these nutrients can my child get from food? \u0081 Is my child already getting enough of any of these nutrients from his current multivitamin and mineral supplement? \u0081 Are there any lab tests required prior to taking the supplements? (Basic lab tests are listed in Appendix 7.) Regarding each individual supplement you're considering for your child: \u0081 What type of symptom relief should I expect? \u0081 Are there any potential side effects or adverse reactions?\u0081 Are there any potential interactions with my child's medications?\u0081 What is a safe and effective dosage for my child?\u0081 How long should he take the supplement? \u0081 How do I assess the effectiveness of the supplement?\u0081 Is this particular supplement intended for short-term or long-term use? \u0081 When should I discontinue the supplement? 3. Together, develop a plan to incorporate the supplements you choose to try into your child's current nutritional care plan. Congratulations\u2014you've reached the end of my 10-Step Nutrition Plan, and hopefully you've seen some exciting and encouraging improvement in your child's symptoms.Keep in mind that, as with any treatment, some of these nutritional interventions willbe very helpful for your child and some will not. Improving your child's nutritional sta-tus is an ongoing and often slow process. But if you're consistent, patient, and maintaina positive attitude, you will nd the right nutritional path for your child.

Gluten and casein are found in most ofthe prepackaged, processed foods commonly consumed by autistic children, so nding\"safe\" foods that will appeal to your child can be tough. To help you make your child'stransition to the GFCF diet as easy and tasty as possible, this section includes morethan seventy kid-friendly, gluten- and casein-free recipes that cover a wide range ofmain courses, beverages, breads, crackers, desserts, and condiments. Best of all, you'llnd gluten- and casein-free alternatives to many of your child's favorites dishes, such aspizza, chicken nuggets, and macaroni and cheese. As with all elimination diets, your goal is not just to eliminate foods that contain \"unsafe\" ingredients, but to replace these food with healthier alternatives To this end,these recipes were designed to provide your child with healthy alternatives, free notonly of gluten and casein, but also of soy, rened white sugar, trans-fatty acids, and ar-ticial chemicals. Additionally, many of the recipes include ingredients that will natu-rally increase your child's intake of healthy omega-3 fatty acids. (An added bonus: Sinceit can be very difcult to get autistic children to eat their veggies, page 210 has a recipefor a vegetable puree that you can \"sneak\" into many different recipes to increase yourchild's nutrient intake.)

MASHED POTATOES Serves 4 Without dairy, mashed potatoes lack creaminess. Oil is added to this recipe to offset this characteristic. 1 pound of russet or Y ukon gold potatoes\u00bd cup rice milk2 teaspoons canola oil \u00bc teaspoon sea salt Wash, peel, and chop potatoes into large chunks. Place in a saucepan and cover withwater. Over medium heat, boil for approximately 10 to 15 minutes until potatoes arevery tender. Drain potatoes and return them to the pan or mixing bowl.

A registered dietitian is a food and nutrition expert who provides her clients with reli- able, objective nutrition information, helps them separate fact from ction, and trans-lates the latest scientic ndings into understandable nutrition information. Aregistered dietitian offers Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT), in which she makes acomprehensive assessment of your child's nutritional status by analyzing his medicaland diet history, laboratory test results, weight and growth measurements, and feedingskills. Using this information, an RD will develop an individualized nutrition treat-ment plan for your child, provide nutrition counseling, nutrition-care coordination,and will monitor his progress. WHAT TYPE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING DOES AN RD RECEIVE? In order to be considered a nationally accredited registered dietitian, RDs must com- plete a minimum of a bachelor's degree in dietetics, foods and nutrition, or a related areaat an accredited U.S. college or university. They must also complete a supervised clinicalexperience of at least six to twelve months in length and pass a national examination. In addition, many states have regulatory laws governing dietitians. Today, approxi- mately forty-six states have laws that regulate dietitians or nutritionists through licen-sure, certication, or registration. For information on your state's regulations, checkwith the Commission of Dietetic Registration (CDR), agency for theAmerican Dietetic Association, at www.cdrnet.org/certications/licensure. 2130738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 213WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A REGISTERED DIETITIAN AND A NUTRITIONIST? The terms dietitian and nutritionist are often used interchangeably, but there's a big dif- ference between the two that you need to be aware of. In the United States, the term di- etitian is legally protected, and an individual can't use the title \"dietitian\" unless she has met the specic educational and experiential requirements and passed the national reg- istration exam. On the other hand, the term nutritionist is notlegally protected in the United States. Some, but not all, states do offer some form of legal protection for theterm nutritionist. Therefore, it's important to remember that a \"nutritionist\" may not actually have any education, training, or experience in foods and nutrition. If you'reseeking the counsel of a \"nutritionist,\" be sure to ask if she's a registered dietitianand/or a licensed or certied dietitian or nutritionist within her state. HOW DO I FIND A REGISTERED DIETITIAN? There are several ways to locate an RD. Here are a few suggestions: 1. Contact the American Dietetic Association (ADA) at www.eatright.org. Click on the \"Find a Nutrition Professional\" link, then click on the \"Find a Nutri-tion Professional Consumer Search\" link. You'll be directed to enter your areacode and state to get a listing of registered dietitians in your community. 2. Contact your state dietetic association. Most state dietetic association Web sites have a link called \"Find a Dietitian\" for consumers looking for a list of regis-tered dietitians in their community. 3. Contact the Nutrition in Complementary Care (NCC), a dietary practice group of the American Dietetic Association. The NCC is a group of registereddietitians interested in alternative therapies and dietary supplements, and youcan reach them at www.complementarynutrition.org. Just enter your state un-der \"Find-A-Comp Care\" and you'll get a list of registered dietitians in yourstate interested in complementary nutrition care. 4. If your child is under the age of three and has a developmental disability or delay, he may qualify to receive services from a statewide program called EarlyChildhood Intervention (ECI). A registered dietitian is part of the team of service providers in an ECI Program.214 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 214HOW DO I CHOOSE THE RIGHT REGISTERED DIETITIAN FOR MY CHILD? Finding a registered dietitian is not difcult, but nding the right dietitian for your child can be a challenge. Just like any other healthcare professional, registered dietitians have specic areas of expertise and personal interest. Not all registered dietitians haveexperience in providing services to children with autism and other related disorders. It'simportant to nd a dietitian who can meet your child's unique dietary needs. Once youhave a list of registered dietitians in your community, I suggest you narrow the listdown by asking each dietitian the following questions: What type of training and experience do you have working with children with autism and related disorders such as Asperger's, PDD, and ADHD? Are you comfortable recommending nutritional supplements, herbs, and nu- traceuticals? Are you interested in complementary and alternative medicine? Are you a member of the Nutrition in Complementary Care (NCC) dietary prac- tice group of the American Dietetic Association? If you have experience with providing nutrition therapy to children with other de- velopmental disabilities, but not autism, are you willing to learn? If you have trouble nding the right registered dietitian for your child in your local community, please don't give up. Expand your search to neighboring communities un-til you nd the right match.215 APPENDIX 1: CHOOSING A REGISTERED DIETITIAN0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 215APPENDIX 2 The Best Dietary Sources for Protein, Fiber, and Calcium PROTEIN Food Serving Size (grams) Beans (cooked) Beans 1 cup 15 (black, kidney, lima, navy, pinto) Beans, white 1 cup 17 Chickpeas (garbanzo beans) 1 cup 15 Beef (cooked) Beef, retail cuts, all grades 3 ounces 22 Frankfurter, beef (8 per 1 pound) 1 each 6 Ground beef 3 ounces 22 Ribs 3 ounces 19 Cheese Cheese, cheddar 1 ounce 7 Cheese, mozzarella 1 ounce 6 Cheese, Swiss 1 ounce 8 Cheese, goat 1 ounce 5 Cheese, cottage, creamed 1 cup 26 Cheese, processed, American 1 slice (\u00be oz) 5 2160738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 216Egg Egg, fresh, whole 1 large 6 Egg substitute, powder \u00be ounce 11 Fish (cooked) Cod, Atlantic 3 ounces 19 Salmon, Atlantic, wild 3 ounces 22 Salmon, Atlantic, farmed 3 ounces 19 T una, light, canned in oil 3 ounces 25 T una, light, canned in water 3 ounces 22 T una, white, canned in oil 3 ounces 23 T una, white, canned in water 3 ounces 20 White, mixed species 3 ounces 21 Shrimp, breaded & fried 4 large 6 Milk Milk, whole 1 cup 8 Milk, nonfat (skim or fat free) 1 cup 8 Milk, low fat, 1% milk fat 1 cup 8 Milk, reduced fat, 2% milk fat 1 cup 8 Milk, dry powder, nonfat14cup 11 Nuts/Seeds Almonds, raw 1 cup 30 Almonds 1 ounce (23 each) 6 Cashews, dry roasted 1 cup 21 Cashews 1 ounce 4 Mixed nuts with peanuts, dry roasted 1 cup 24 Mixed nuts 1 ounce 5 Peanuts, all types, dry roasted 1 cup 35 Peanuts 1 ounce 7 Pecans, halves 1 cup 10 Pecans 1 ounce (19 halves) 3 Pine nuts 1 cup 19 Pine nuts 1 ounce (167 kernels) 4 Pistachios, raw 1 cup 25217 APPENDIX 2: THE BEST DIETARY SOURCES FOR PROTEIN, FIBER, AND CALCIUM0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 217PROTEIN (Continued) Food Serving Size Protein (grams) Nuts/Seeds (cont.)

INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PROGRAM (IEP) An IEP is a written plan for providing special education and related services to a childwith a disability covered under the Individual Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). TheIEP is the cornerstone of the child's education program and is designed to ensure thathe receives the appropriate special education and related services to meet his educa-tional needs. The IEP includes annual goals, short-term objectives, and an evaluationschedule. An IEP offers an excellent opportunity to designate the required nutrition services to address your child's cognitive, educational, and nutritional needs. When a nutritionproblem is identied for a child with a disability, a registered dietitian may be involvedin the team meeting at the request of the parents or the school to participate in devel-oping the child's IEP . Within an IEP , nutrition services may be specied as special edu- cation (specially designed instruction) or a related service (support services required to assist your child to benet from his special education). Here are some examples of ways to incorporate nutrition services into your child's IEP: His registered dietitian can consult with school food service staff to help meet your child's special nutritional needs. His registered dietitian can review and modify school menus to ensure they com- ply with your child's diet prescribed by his physician.0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 227228 EATING FOR AUTISM Special education funds can be used to purchase special foods to accommodate your child's diet. This is especially helpful if your child is on the GFCF diet or needs other school meal modications. School staff can give your child an afternoon snack two hours after lunch to help avoid a negative behavioral response to low blood sugar. School staff can develop and provide learning activities to teach your child about his dietary restrictions. This is especially helpful if your child is on the GFCF dietor has a life-threatening food allergy. An assigned school staff member can monitor your child at lunch to ensure com- pliance with diet restrictions. This is helpful if your child tends to take food fromother children. The school nurse can measure your child's weight and height monthly, which is critical for children on stimulant medication that can affect their appetite andgrowth. A home economics teacher can teach your child about menu planning, grocery shopping, and food preparation skills. These are critical life skills for a high schoolstudent. A behavioral specialist can suggest a nonfood reward system/reinforcer to be used in place of food. Disability Defined The term disability under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) recog- nizes thirteen disability categories, including autism, specic learning disabilities, and speech or language impairment. Attention decit disorder or attention decit hyperactivity disorder may fall under one of the thirteen categories. SCHOOL MENU MODIFICATIONS Substitutions or modications to the school menu are allowed for children with a disability who are unable to eat a regular school meal. If you need to do this, your re-quest to substitute or modify a school meal must be supported by a statement signed bya licensed physician. The medical statement must include the following information:0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 228 Your child's disability. An explanation of why the disability restricts your child's diet. The major life activity affected by the disability. (Major life activity is dened as caring for one's self, doing manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and working). The food or foods to be omitted from your child's diet, and the food or choice of foods that must be substituted. If your child has a disability that restricts his diet, he's entitled to modied school meals at no extra charge. Sources of funding to purchase special foods your child needs can in-clude special education funds if the substitute food is specied in his IEP . For more detailed information on this topic, as well as information on children without disabilities who have special dietary needs, read the USDA Food and Nutrition Services' \"Accommodating Children with Special Dietary Needs in the School Nutri-tion Program,\" available at www.fns.usda.gov/cnd.229 APPENDIX 4: IEP NUTRITION GOALS AND OBJECTIVES0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 229PHYSICIAN'S STATEMENT FOR CHILD WITH DISABILITY Date: Name of Child: Date of Birth: Child's disability: Describe why the disability restricts the child's diet: Describe the major life activity affected by the child's disability: List food/foods to be omitted from the child's diet and the food or choice of foods that must be substituted: Signature of Licensed Physician Date0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 230APPENDIX 5 Data Collection Forms The purpose of a trial response is to help you determine which special diets and ad- vanced nutritional supplements are benecial for your child. The ultimate goal is toavoid keeping your child on an unnecessary restrictive diet or supplement. These data collection forms were designed to provide you with a means to collect data and objectively determine if a special diet or advanced nutritional supplement is oris not benecial for your child. A trial response is notnecessary for a basic multivitamin and mineral or essential fatty acid supplement. GENERAL GUIDELINES The nal decision to perform a trial response on a special diet or nutritional supplement must be made by you. You should not feel pressured to try a nutritionintervention you're not comfortable with. Seek help from a registered dietitian when implementing any dietary changes, special diets, and advanced nutritional supplements. I advise you to seek the assistance from a supportive nutrition-oriented physician while implementing a trial response for medical supervision, monitoring, andjoint-decision making purposes. Inform your child's therapists and teachers about the trial response and ask them to help by documenting their observations. You may also want to tell family members and other caregivers about the trial response to ensure the nutrition intervention is completely adhered to outside thehome. 2310738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 231232 EATING FOR AUTISM Remember that you're actually performing a \"mini experiment\" on your child and you must remain objective, systematic, and observant and document all results. INSTRUCTIONS Prior to the trial response, complete the following: Fill in the baseline data form. Describe in detail your child's current symptoms. Indicate the number of times per day, week, or month they occur. (This informa- tion is critical since it will be used to assess the effectiveness of the nutritional in- tervention at the completion of the trial response.) Request input from your child's therapists and teachers who work with your child on a regular basis. (Their information will be helpful regarding your child's cur-rent symptoms.) TRIAL RESPONSE: With help from your child's registered dietitian, determine which nutrition inter- vention to try for your child. \u0081Don't initiate more than one newnutritional intervention at a time. Don't initiate a trial response if your child is starting a new medication for the rst time. Determine the length of the trial response. The period of time for the trial re- sponse will vary based on the specic nutritional intervention. Here are some gen-eral guidelines for periods of time: Vitamin B6:one month DMG: one month Gluten Free Casein Diet: months Other nutrients: individualized\u2014discuss your child's registered dietitian. Elimination diet (food allergy/sensitivity/intolerance): individualized\u2014discuss with your child's physician and/or registered dietitian. Initiate the new nutritional intervention for the trial response. Complete the response data form on a weekly basis to document your child's symptoms.0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 232233 APPENDIX 5: DATA COLLECTION FORMS Describe in detail your child's symptoms during the trial response. Gather input from your child's therapists and teachers regarding their docu- mented observations of your child's symptoms during the trial response. EVALUATION At the end of the trial response time period, evaluate the results of the nutritional intervention. Compare the response data to the baseline data. For each of your child's symptoms, determine if the nutritional intervention re- sulted in substantial improvement, some improvement, no change, or made things worse. Document your conclusions on the evaluation form. If you determine that the nutritional intervention made no difference or made your child's symptoms worse, stop the nutritional intervention. This particular nutrition intervention may notbe benecial for your child. If you determine the nutritional intervention resulted in substantial improvement and/or some improvement in one or more of your child's symptoms, continue thenutritional intervention. This particular nutrition intervention may be benecialfor your child. If you determine the nutritional intervention resulted in a combination of both positive and negative results, discuss the results with your child's physician and/or registered dietitian and decide if nutritional intervention should be continued.0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 233BASELINE DATA FORM Nutritional Intervention: Date: Symptom Describe in Detail Child's Symptoms Communication (verbal, speech, echolalia, conversation, eye contact) Social Interaction (interaction with others, social play, friendships)Behavior (self-injury, aggression, tantrums, resistant to change)Activities and Interest (stimming, pre-occupation with objects and/ or one interest) Sleep (falls asleep, stays asleep) Enuresis (bed wetting) Hyperactivity Focus and Attention Skin (eczema, hives, rashes) Ears (ear infections) Eyes (dark circles, red, itchy, watery) Respiratory (asthma, bronchitis, stuffy/ runny nose)Bowels (constipation, loose stools, diarrhea, gas, bloating)Feeding (limited variety of foods, refuse new foods)0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 234RESPONSE DATA FORM Nutritional Intervention: Dates: To Week: Symptom Describe in Detail Child's Symptoms Communication (verbal, speech, echolalia, conversation, eye contact) Social Interaction (interaction with others, social play, friendships)Behavior (self-injury, aggression, tantrums, resistant to change)Activities & Interest (stimming, preoccupation with objects and/ or one interest) Sleep (falls asleep, stays asleep) Enuresis (bed wetting) Hyperactivity Focus and Attention Skin (eczema, hives, rashes) Ears (ear infections) Eyes (dark circles, red, itchy, watery) Respiratory (asthma, bronchitis, stuffy/runny nose)Bowels (constipation, loose stools, diarrhea, gas, bloating)Feeding (limited variety of foods, refuse new foods)0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 235EVALUATION FORM Nutritional Intervention: Date: Substantial No Symptom Improvement Improvement Change Worsening Communication (verbal, speech, echolalia, conversation, eye contact) Social Interaction (interaction with others, social play, friendships Behavior (self-injury, aggression, tantrums, resistant to change)Activities and Interest (stimming, preoccupation with objects and/ or one interest) Sleep (falls asleep, stays asleep) Enuresis (bed wetting) Hyperactivity Focus and Attention Skin (eczema, hives, rashes) Ears (ear infections) Eyes (dark circles, red, itchy, watery)Respiratory (asthma, bronchitis, stuffy/runny noseBowels (constipation, loose stools, diarrhea, gas, bloating)Feeding (limited variety of foods, refuse new foods)0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 236APPENDIX 6 Nutritional Detoxification Plan Children live in a very toxic world today compared to a generation ago. There are more than eighty thousand chemicals in commercial use in the United States. More than2.58 billion pounds of toxic chemicals are released into the air, water, and land by in-dustrial facilities nationwide every year. More than 4.5 billion pounds of pesticideproducts are used each year as well. This means our children are exposed to a huge andever-increasing number of toxic chemicals, which makes them more vulnerable to de-velopmental, learning, and behavioral disabilities than previous generations. This is amajor concern for parents, especially those in the autism community who are searchingfor safe, effective, and noninvasive ways to rid their children's bodies of toxins. Below are a few basic nutritional steps you can take to naturally enhance your child's ability to detoxify. My plan will show you how to reduce his exposure to toxins, helphim eat a more protective diet, and use additional helpful nutrients. STEP1: IDENTIFY AND ELIMINATE SOURCES OF TOXIN EXPOSURE The most effective natural treatment is to identify the sources of toxins in your child'senvironment and eliminate his exposure to them. Following is a list of potential sourcesof toxins your child may come into contact with: Home Age and condition of your home Recent renovation or home repairs Vinyl miniblinds manufactured in the 1990s Indoor and outdoor pesticides 2370738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 237 Sources of indoor heating, such as wood and gas stoves and replaces Radon (in homes with a basement) Indoor cigarette smoke Take-home exposure from parental occupations Parental hobbies, such as using an indoor ring range, arts and crafts, making stained glass Pressed-treated wood on deck and playground equipment Proximity of your home to a hazardous waste site Exposure to toxins at daycare, school, and play areas Herbs, Nutritional Supplements, and Other Remedies Folk remedies contaminated with toxins such as lead, mercury, or arsenic Herbal products contaminated with toxins Herbal plants harvested from contaminated soils Multivitamin and mineral supplements contaminated with toxins Drinking Water Unltered tap water can contain bacteria, viruses, parasites, natural toxins, inorganic and organic chemicals, disinfectants, and radon Private wells contaminated with pesticides Food Food chemical additives, such as articial colors, flavors, and preservatives Pesticide residue on fresh fruits and vegetables Bioaccumulative chemicals, such as dioxins and PCBs in sh Use of imported canned food products where the can is soldered with lead Food prepared in imported pottery or metal containers Excess consumption of sh contaminated with mercury Behavioral Characteristics of Your Child Pica (eating nonfood items) Hand-to-mouth activity Doesn't wash his hands before meals and snacks238 EATING FOR AUTISM0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 238239 APPENDIX 6: NUTRITIONAL DETOXIFICATION PLAN STEP 2: OPTIMIZE YOUR CHILD'S DIET Nutrient deficiencies are associated with an increased absorption of toxins. It's criti- cal that your child eat a wide variety of healthy foods from all the major food groupsto ensure he's taking in enough amino acids, essential fatty acids, vitamins, and min-erals. Mineral deficiencies especially put your child at risk for increased absorption oftoxins. For an adequate healthy diet, your child should: Eat a variety of foods that supply vitamins and minerals. Eat foods that are a good source of protein and critical minerals such as calcium, iron, and zinc. Identify and treat vitamin and mineral deficiencies in your child. Ask his pediatrician to do a laboratory test to identify iron deciency anemia. Make sure he takes a daily multivitamin and mineral supplement that contains 100 to 300 percent of his RDA in all areas. STEP 3: USE ADDITIONAL NUTRIENTS Below is a list of additional nutrients that naturally support your child's detoxication function, which will help his body get rid of toxins more efciently. Alpha-Lipoic Acid. Dosage: Supplement intake ranges up to 600 mg per day in adults. Discuss proper dosage with your child's registered dietitian. Glutathione. Glutathione in supplement form is not well-absorbed in the gastrointesti- nal tract, so it's not usually recommended as an oral supplement. Instead, I suggest youfocus on increasing the amount of cysteine (precursor to glutathione) your child getsfrom dietary sources, such as beef, pork, chicken, turkey, eggs, milk, and whey protein. N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Dosage: Supplement intake ranges up to 600 mg once to three times daily for adults. Discuss proper dosage with your child's registered dietitian. Selenium. Dosage: Supplement intake ranges from at least 100 percent of your child's RDA, but should not exceed his UL. T urn to Appendix 3 to find your child's RDAand UL.0738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 2/12/09 2:30 PM (TMG). Dosage: Supplement intakes typically range from 600-650 mg per day for adults. Discuss proper dosage with your child's registered dietitian. Vitamin C. Dosage: Supplemental intake of 200 mg per day is enough to maximize plasma and lymphocyte levels; however, levels ranging from 500 to 2,000 mg are often suggested for adults. Do not exceed your child's UL for vitamin C without recom-mendation from his physician or registered dietitian. T urn to Appendix 3 for yourchild's UL. Estimating Proper Dosage for Your Child Often a therapeutic dosage for a particular nutrient, herb, or nutraceutical is sug- gested for an adult, but not a child. In this situation, your physician and/or regis-tered dietitian will estimate your child's dosage. Here's the most common methodused to estimate a child's dosage: Adult Dosage \u00f7 150 x Child's Weight = Child's Dosage For example, the adult dosage suggested for alpha-lipoic acid is 600 mg. If a child weighs 35 pounds, how much is the estimated dosage for that child? 600mg \u00f7 150 x 35 = 140 mg Please keep in mind that this is only an estimate, and your child's physician and/or registered dietitian will make adjustments based on his unique needs.

Many laboratory tests marketed directly to the autism community are very controver- sial and may not be reliable or helpful in choosing the appropriate nutritional interven-tions for your child. These tests are usually not covered by health insurance and maycost a family thousands of dollars out of pocket. I prefer to utilize standardized lab teststhat are available through any commercial lab and reimbursed by insurance companieswith a physician's order. Below is a list of basic lab tests to assist you and your child's registered dietitian in in- dividualizing his nutrition plan. Complete Blood Count (CBC) Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) Blood Lead Thyroid Function (T3, T4, TSH) IgE RAST (basic foods) Carnitine (free, total, and acylcarnitine) Specic Vitamins and Minerals (these will be individualized based on your child's medications, suspected nutrient deciencies, clinical history, and other factors) Your physicial may recommend additional lab tests to assess your child's immune function, identify gastrointestinal disorders, and address any other health concerns. More detailed information on lab tests is available at www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/laboratorytests. 2410738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 2410738212432_3.qxp:PB: 7 x 9.125 2/12/09 2:30 PM Page 242 This page intentionally left blank 243GLOSSARY Acetylcholinesterase.

Protein. Large organic compounds made of amino acids required for the structure, func- tion, and regulation of the body's cells, tissues, and organs. They participate in everyprocess within cells. Reactive hypoglycemia. An abnormal spike in blood glucose level due to eating a food or meal high in carbohydrate which triggers the pancreas to release an excess amount of in-sulin to lower the blood glucose level. This in turn causes the blood glucose level to droprapidly (reactive hypoglycemia), triggering the release of adrenaline and other hormonesto raise the blood glucose level once again. Retinol binding protein. A family of protein that has a diverse number of functions. They are carriers of protein that bind retinol (preformed vitamin A) and can be measured in alaboratory test to assess visceral protein mass related to nutritional health. Saccharin. Also known as Sweet'N Low, this sugar substitute is about three-hundred to ve-hundred times sweeter than table sugar. S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine (SAMe). A coenzyme involved in methyl group transfer.
