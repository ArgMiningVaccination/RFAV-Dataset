According to the study, some immune cell subsets like Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs), support tumour growth by suppressing the anti-tumour immune response and by generating a favourable environment for the tumour. MDSC is one of the regulators of your body's immune system. The scientists added that though similar studies have given inconsistent results, and most research has focused on negative emotional states, such as stress and depression, the impact of a positive mental state on cancer biology is largely unknown.
