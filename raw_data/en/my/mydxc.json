Biogenic Medicine routinely correlates a person's physical problems with emotional disturbances and conflicts that are happening on a deeper level. It grew from my attempts at harmonizing the new and important science of color psychology with ancient Chinese medicine.For each pain, there is a reason in the depths of consciousness. Dr. Reinhold Voll Biogenics is the practice of spiritual and emotional medicine in addition to dealing thoroughly with the problems of the body. This kind of medicine demands that we penetrate and appreciate what is going on inside the world of the patient. This calls for deep listening abilities and the caring and compassion necessary for the inner worlds of others. To get to this level of diagnostic perception we must have the ability to let go of our learned stereotypical concepts and rise to a level beyond them. People are not concepts, and the truth and reality of diseases go far beyond diagnostic labels. Concepts in general and diagnostic labels only approximate reality but they never are actually reality. Reality is not a concept!We cannot begin to flow towards another person or towards our own higher or inner being until the psychic skin covering the heart is removed.Western [medicine](https://www.naturalnews.com/medicine.html) has no way of addressing problems and disease on a \"being\" level. Oriented around or attached to one-dimensional physical views and definitions of human reality, medicine today is blind and helpless in helping people recover from their most basic disease. [Dr. Ryke Geerd Hamer](http://www.alternative-cancer-care.com/Dr_Ryke_Geerd_Hamer.html) , a German internist, surgeon, and creator of what is called German New Medicine, discovered that physical events combined with internal emotional reactions to create what he called a \"biological conflict shock,\" which will manifest itself as a visible physical transformation in the brain as well as measurable changes in physical-nervous parameters. From these central changes he saw the development of cancerous growths, ulcerations, necroses and functional disturbances in specific organs of the body. Thus Dr. Hamer felt that it was worth the physician's efforts to find the shocking event that precipitated the onset of early symptoms that inevitably lead to the full onset of diseases such as cancer, which will be different for each person. Physical disease is often a mirror of our Achilles' heel. It reflects back to us something connected to a tragic flaw, as Shakespeare would have put it. It is always the one thing that we do not want to look at that brings us to ruin in life. Yet there are certain life events like the sudden loss of a loved one, rape, or intense experiences in combat that bring on a trauma that is beyond the ability of well-adjusted [people](https://www.naturalnews.com/people.html) to deal with. In his book Emotional Intelligence , Daniel Goleman reported a similar process to what Dr. Hamer outlines in post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD).Love is the most cost-effective medical insurance policy and the cheapest medicine there is. Dr. Brenda SchaefferThere is an ingredient to health and healing that has been largely overlooked. This factor is love and it is very important in immune system function. When love is generating our perceptions we go to a level of medicine that they do not teach in medical school. With real love we begin to see the truly wonderful world of basic medicine, a place where we appreciate that water is actually our most basic and fundamental medicine. The sun as well, and then there is the state of our sexualities and relationships and what is happening on these important levels. The state of our hearts, our vulnerability center, needs to also be considered but modern day physicians rarely take the time to touch this level of their patients' needs.Unconditional love is your immune system's most powerful stimulant. Dr. Bernie Siegel [Dr. Clancy D. McKenzie](http://www.drmckenzie.com/the-love-enery.html) of Capital University says, \"Enhancing the love energy of the patient is an effective way to increase the healing process. This holds true for both psychological and physical healing. Enhancement of love energy should be a part of every physical remedy, because it is a vital ingredient to healing.\" I developed my [HeartHealth](http://publications.imva.info/index.php/e-books/hearthealth-e-book.html) system to provide a framework for direct penetrations into the heart center, into the level of emotions and feelings. My heart psychology is offered as a replacement to cognitive psychology, which has not been beneficial to the human race in any meaningful way.It is no coincidence that the thymus, the center and director of our immune system, lies just above the heart (\"the high [heart](https://www.naturalnews.com/heart.html)\") and within the heart chakra. Jaquelyn McCandless We are not so much different than plants when you look at the fact that water, sun and minerals come together to give us life. The main reason I am so much into [magnesium medicine](http://publications.imva.info/index.php/e-books/magnesium-medicine-e-book.html) is that magnesium is the primary mineral responsible for life on this planet for it is at the center of chlorophyll allowing photosynthesis to take place. Without it we have a barren planet. Without enough of it in our bodies we slowly break down and often die a sudden death.Spiritual Medicine Caring for people's souls is usually relegated to the priests and pastors of the world but there is a tradition of Pastoral Medicine, which is defined as a system of health care that incorporates and attends the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects while only using natural substances for the treatment of disease in the body. I am a doctor of Pastoral Medicine. In truth, treating the body with my [Natural Allopathic Medicine](http://blog.imva.info/medicine/natural-allopathic-medicine) is simple and that is why I can teach people how to begin to apply it in an hour. When I open Sanctuary it will not be for people to come to be treated by me on a physical level because I would already have been able to provide that support from a distance, like I have been doing for years. It will be for much deeper [spiritual](https://www.naturalnews.com/spiritual.html) , mental, and emotional reasons, and that is why I am conceiving Sanctuary as a spiritual hospital in addition to being a retreat center.Detoxification, depressurization, purification and re-mineralization lead to complete healings when issues of the soul are dealt with completely. Sanctuary is a place where we will take care of hearts and souls. It is where my wife Luciana and I will attend to the deeper needs of people. Yes it will be a place for detoxification for it is pristine and a perfect place for retreat. In future years people will be able to come here for profound journeys into their souls. My next-door neighbor, 200 meters away, has a temple in which to drink [Ayahuasca](http://imva.info/sanctuary/news/ayahuasca) , which shares some similarities with psilocybin. Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine in the U.S. have found that psilocybin, an important element in mushrooms, is capable of instilling a deep feeling of spirituality, which may bring about healing, especially for those patients who have a huge psychological baggage weighing them down . The researchers administered magic mushrooms to 36 study participants who had never consumed any hallucinogenic drugs. All these participants were firmly rooted in their religious beliefs. The study found that nearly two-thirds of the subjects felt a unique spiritual experience, akin to the birth of a baby. Even two months after the consumption of the magic mushrooms, the subjects felt peaceful with a sense of wellbeing. Studies are ongoing to ease the stress of cancer.At Sanctuary Life does not get any better! I can hardly imagine ever leaving this paradise. [Sanctuary](http://imva.info/sanctuary/) is hidden behind two rivers that surround us on three sides. Behind us on the fourth side is a mountain, so we feel and actually are protected. When it rains the rivers rise and we are trapped in our heaven and I love that. Right behind and below the house are our Healing Gardens where we swim in the river and soak up the sun as we watch the water go by. Right now Sanctuary is a spiritual hospital for me. I myself constantly face new challenges in my life and these months here with my wife and family have set up the framework for an exciting new life -- even as I look around and see collapse threatening the mainstream world. I feel many needs inside of me that can be worked upon in solitude while everyone is away and am happy for that. I am still at least six months away from opening Sanctuary to the public because there is much to finish and debts to be paid. Right now I have the place to myself for the holidays so at this moment it's my fortress of solitude. Actually I consider it as my fortress of light and castle of love. In the future you will be hearing much more from me about light, color and the meditative practice of solar gazing. This morning after two weeks of rain the sun rose over the mountain and I was there gazing at its glorious radiance. Solar gazing is a wonderful and very powerful meditation that one has to be ready for. One eats the light directly when opening up the portals of the eyes and gazing directly into the light at sunrise or sunset. It is a good moment to seek one's own pure and powerful consciousness, which radiates out its awareness like the sun does 24/7. This is a subject that is close to my heart, in fact, to all our hearts because it is directly related to light and its consumption. Most people don't know that they are consuming light every second of every day and night and that they have a built-in apparatus that automatically does this. Our astral bodies and chakra systems are energetic antenna systems and we absorb the cosmic light with them. Light and its consumption are important elements in medicine and for psychology as well -- for the way a person absorbs the spectrum colors determines most everything about that person's personality and its expression. The only thousand-page books I ever read are about this subject and they were both by Christopher Hills. [Dr. Max Luscher](http://www.luscher-color.com/) developed his famous color test over 50 years ago proving forever the importance and power of color in shaping how we think, react and feel.The pure heart stops all thinking, all imagining, and just experiences things and people as they are. There is a great secret to life, health and disease, one that is little known, understood or talked about except in relatively vague ways, and this secret explains largely why one person gets sick and another does not under the influence of the same causes. Our bodies have a core, a central point, just like the solar system does. Without the sun at the heart of our system, the planets would just fly off and away because without a coherent centre there is no harmony, and even existence comes into doubt. The sun obviously leads to life through a combination of forces and factors. Gravity, light, warmth, radiation on non-visible spectrums, magnetism -- its place in the centre anchors the entire system. In each human, such a centre exists and it provides cohesion to all the cells in the same way that the sun unifies the entire solar system. The word sun does not do justice to the immense importance that exists in such an object, and the word in all languages that expresses this centre in humans suffers from a similar limitation. Known in ancient medicine as the supreme controller of bodily functions and known equally well in bibles, religions and spiritual traditions is the human heart -- this is at the centre of our lives. And yet modern medicine knows this not.Special Note : For years I looked for a partner in this endeavor and did not find anyone. Now my wife is fully aboard and I am more than happy about that. Also, I have invited people to come to our valley where some land can be purchased for something less than a fortune. I am nearly ready to receive people and can offer very comfortable accommodations with the understanding that we are not finished with the center. This pre-opening invitation is for people I know and have been in communication with at some point during the years, including all those with whom I have already consulted. I have someone wanting to partner with me to start translating and presenting my work to the Spanish world and want to do the same for the Portuguese world as well, but I lack the funds at present to set these projects in motion. Anyone looking for a business opportunity is invited to inquire. I am now inviting people from different countries and languages to set up local operations, in partnership with [the IMVA](http://imva.info/) .
