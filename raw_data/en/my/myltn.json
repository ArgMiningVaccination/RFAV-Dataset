Therefore, if you started to investigate detox and want to invest in your health - you have done the right thing and come to the right place. Here, in this article, you will find all you need to know about heavy metals and how to remove them from your body. We are talking about how heavy metals enter your body, what are the symptoms and early warning signs of heavy metal poisoning, and which special plants can become your saviors. To cleanse your body from heavy metals requires dedication and work. You might have to change your diet, and if necessary, implement new habits. The good news is that the healthier your lifestyle is, the easier the cleansing process will be. So, depending on the amount of contamination and the condition of your body, it can take months, sometimes up to a year and a half, to finally get rid of all the toxins and heavy metals. Heavy metals and waste products are excreted by organs such as the liver, spleen, lymph, kidney and intestine. As they accumulate, the body stores toxic compounds mainly in adipose tissue to save vital organs. With the continued supply of toxins, they eventually end up in vital organs such as the brain, bloodstream, thyroid, nervous system, etc., causing serious illnesses. When you start to cleanse your body, you should consider all organs involved in [detoxification](https://ecosh.com/product/body-cleansing-detox/). The kidneys, liver and lymph nodes as well as the intestines need your support. By providing such support, your body will be purified effectively without side effects. However, some people may still experience increased fatigue, stomach gas production, and difficulty in concentrating.

Heavy metal compounds are released into the environment through human activity. For example, through fertilizers, pesticides, wastewater, landfills, metals, mining and transport. Naturally, heavy metals can also be released into the environment due to volcanic activity and larger fires. They can also get into your body directly. For example, if you eat canned foods, have amalgam fillings, use Teflon pans, are vaccinated or affected by vehicle exhausts. During pregnancy, when mother has a high proportion of heavy metals in her body, those are passed on to the newborn in the womb. But as heavy metals are associated with the development and severity of autism, you should cleanse your body before planning a pregnancy ( [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2809421/)). What are The Diseases and Health Problems Caused by Heavy Metals? Heavy metal compounds are dangerous because they are nondegradable and last extremely long in the environment. From the environment, heavy metals enter the human body and cause damage to the brain, liver, central nervous system and other vital areas. Heavy metals weaken the [immune system], making it vulnerable to diseases. And worst of all, they feed cancer, viruses, bacteria, and other invaders, which in turn contribute to the development of diseases.

Atlantic Red Seaweed (Dulse Seaweed, Palmaria Palmata) Dulse seaweed binds mercury, lead, aluminum, copper, cadmium and nickel. The seaweed also crosses the blood-brain barrier. Unlike other algae, this seaweed is able to remove mercury by itself. It enters the depths and hidden places of the body, finds mercury, binds it and does not release it before leaving the body. 2. Barley Grass Extract Powder This powerful grass has the ability to draw heavy metals out of your intestinal tract, spleen, pancreas, thyroid, and reproductive system. Barley grass extract powder prepares the mercury for complete absorption by the spirulina. 3. Spirulina This edible alga draws heavy metals out from your central nervous system, brain and liver, and absorbs heavy metals extracted by barley grass extract powder. 4.

It restores the liver that can be exhausted from Epstein Barr, herpes zoster, HHV-6, cytomegalovirus, harmful bacteria, worms, fungi and other pathogens.

The purification process depends on how contaminated your organism is. To totally cleanse your body from toxins can take 1 month up to a one year and a half. Here is a tip, if it's challenging for you to consume all the 7 heavy metal removing plants listed above, you can try Ecosh Body Cleansing Detox, which includes all the same ingredients and is 100% natural. How Do I Know for Sure if I Have Heavy Metals in My Body? Heavy metals in the body can be measured in a medical laboratory with magnetic bioresonance analyzer and simple heavy metal tests. Heavy metals levels could be measured before starting the cleansing process and then for example every next month, to monitor how the cleansing works. What Can be The Side Effects of Cleansing? The most common side effects are fatigue, headaches and initially diarrhea. Having high levels of toxins in your body, diarrhea is a normal part of the cleansing process. It will pass. Other side effects may include, for example, gases, drowsiness, dizziness, insomnia, nausea, vomiting, anxiety and irritation. Even more, in the case of more severe intoxication, there can be panic attacks, feeling unwell, bad taste in the mouth, rashes, etc. It's because heavy metals started to move in your body, and it affects the nervous system. The fact that the body may begin to expel toxins through the skin is also a normal side effect. To minimize or avoid side effects, it's a good idea to start the cleansing process gradually. This way you will avoid shocking your body too much. Calm, gentle and long-term cleansing of the body prevents the side effects from occurring or these will be significantly less severe. However, if the side effects are too exhausting for you to handle, reduce the dose and wait until the situation has stabilized. Then gradually increase the dose again. How to Use Body Cleansing Detox? With Ecosh Body Cleansing Detox, start with small doses, so that your body gets used to the plants. - For example, start with 1-2 teaspoons 2 times a day with water or juice for about 1-2 weeks. If you are unfamiliar with algae taste, add banana to your detox drink. - You can gradually increase your dose up to 4 tablespoons a day. For example, take 2 tablespoons in the morning and 2 in the evening. Because to cleanse your body from heavy metals is a long-term process, there is no need to rush. NB! If you start to cleanse your body, it is advisable to find yourself a therapist who can advise you on your diet plan and on any side effects and symptoms you may have. What Else Should You Consider When You Start to Cleanse Your Body? It is undeniably vital to review your diet when starting the cleaning process. During your body purification, it is advisable to eat as much fresh and raw food as possible, because it will help to eliminate toxins. For instance, eat foods and drink beverages such as salads, fruits, vegetables, juices, and mineral-enriched water. The common recommendation is to drink 1.5 to 2 liters of water per day, which also helps prevent headaches. Vegetarians don't need to drink as much water as they need up to a liter. Make warm meals in the evenings. For example, soups, stir fries, vegetable cutlets, etc. It is important to be active, to rest and if possible, take a sauna. However, be careful in the sauna, because your body might be weak and there is a risk of fainting. Those who have not done any cleansing before and have not eaten herbal foods at all, but rather have consumed high-fat and processed foods, are advised to begin by gradually reducing the amount of consumed processed foods and coffee. This is to avoid unpleasant cleansing side effects such as headaches. With What or How Should I Start My Day? - During body cleansing, it is advisable to start the day with warm lemon or lime water (2-3 glasses), to which you can add a grated ginger and a little honey. It helps the liver to excrete toxins produced at night. - Or, for example, to bind and expel the toxins created at night, you can also take a fiber-rich intestinal cleansing detox. Just add 1 tablespoon to a full glass of water or juice and drink it every morning. - In addition to lemon or lime water, it is good to drink raw celery juice every morning. One bunch of celery gives you anywhere from 300 to 500 ml of raw juice. Celery juice can be made with a juicer machine. It has the wonderful ability to heal you from a variety of symptoms including chronic illnesses. Celery contains a large number of useful salts, sodium and potassium, which makes celery juice more saline. Useful properties of celery juice With a daily dose of 500-1000ml of celery juice, you can quickly restore hydrochloric acid levels. Hydrochloric acids are necessary for the stomach to efficiently break down proteins. If the proteins do not break down properly, it causes rotting in the gut, which in turn causes inflammation and diseases. High levels of hydrochloric acid are also important for killing the pathogens that enter thru your mouth. However, to allow the formation of hydrochloric acids at all, it is necessary to intake sufficient amounts of water and other fluids. Hydrochloric acid consists largely from water, and if there is not enough water in your body, heartburn will occur because the hydrochloric acid in the stomach is too acidic, i.e. not diluted with water. Celery juice also increases and strengthens bile production. Strong bile is important for breaking down fats and destroying pathogens. Even more, celery juice also helps to restore the central nervous system, removes old toxins and other poisonous substances such as medicines from the liver and body. - Drink heavy metal detox smoothie after 30 minutes of drinking celery juice. In addition, it is also good to add green coriander into the heavy metal cleansing smoothie. It's because coriander enters deep into inaccessible places in your body and extracts the heavy metals of past times. You can always add a handful of coriander to other smoothies, juices or salads. - Support kidney work with dandelion and field horsetail tea and help lymph work with licorice root (Glycyrrhiza glabra) tea. Why Shouldn't You Start to Cleanse Your Body? Do not start body cleansing if you are: - pregnant, - breast-feeding, - recovering from an illness, - on a course of treatment, unless your doctor agrees.
