When I first went on dialysis in 1989, I chose CAPD (Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis) because I thought it would give me more freedom to travel. That may or may not have been true; with proper planning, people on hemodialysis can travel just about anywhere. But the point is I didn't want kidney failure to mean the end of my traveling days. Now that I have a kidney transplant, it's even easier to \"pick up and go.\" But having a transplant still requires a little extra planning. If you are a transplant recipient planning a trip, here are a few tips to help make sure your trip goes smoothly and safely: 1TAke A gre ATer su PPly of your me DICATI oNs ThAN you WIll NeeD. Due to car prob- lems, missed flights, or just the desire to enjoy one extra day at the beach, trips sometimes last longer then you originally planned. By tak-ing more than you think you will need, you'll ensure that you don't run out of your medicines. I count 'em out before I go. 2\u2014keeP your me DICIN es IN Th eIr or IgINAl BoTTles. Although you may be tempted to transfer your medicines to smaller travel containers to save space, keep them in their original bottles. That way luggage inspectors will know what you are carrying and be less likely to hold you up at airport security. And having the original labeled bottles can make it easier to fill your prescriptions if you somehow run out. 3\u2014If you Are fly INg, kee P you r meDICIN es WITh you.

And thanks to the miracles of dialysis and transplantation I have lived longer and enjoyed more time traveling than would have been possible a mere 65 years ago. 1 1 have transplant will travel have transplant , will travel : traveling tips for recipients By Jack Fassnacht, Kidney Recipient schedule, you may have to take your meds during the flight. unless you're in a movie, it's hard to get down to the cargo hold from the passenger compartment. in this issue... 2 editor's desk 4 tips for nutrition and exercise 6 weight management 7 returning to work 9 People Like Us 10 transplant news digest recipient voices12 recipient voices 13 teens & transplant 14 e-mail support group 15 facts about transplantationfacts about transplantation 16 school days 18 West Nile VirusClick here to continue on page 3 20 value of a pharmacist value of a pharmacist NEXt PAgE 19 the anniversary (poem) 01-70-1401editor's desk Laurel Williams, RN, MSN, CCTC Editor-in-Chief Volunteer Editorial Board Laurel Williams, RN, MSN, cctc edit or-in-Chief University of Nebraska Medical Center Omaha, NE Megan A. tichy , Rd San Francisco, CA dean S. collier , Pharm d University of Nebraska Omaha, NE Jack Fassnacht Chicago, IL Joshua S. goldberg, teen editor Encino, CAShirley Schlessinger , Md University of Mississippi Medical Center Jackson, MS Victoria L.

It is about a seven-year-old boy in the 1900s who had an amazing talent for playing the piano. he had a dedication and commitment to learning to play fa r beyond his seven years. his family recognized his abilities and started him off with piano lessons twice a week with the woman next door. This little boy practiced every morning at 5:00 am . his piano teacher recognized this child's talent as well and realized he would need a different type of instruc-to r to help him reach his potential. so she contacted mrs. e.C. White who was a concert pianist and an instruc-to r to further this child's education. he continued to take lessons and practice da ily and excel in his endeavors. one day mrs. White told him that one of his idols, a Polish pianist named Paderewski, would be playing in a nearby town and invited the boy to at tend the concert. of course, he was thrilled to be invited to the concert and afterwards was taken backstage to me et the master himself. Paderewski asked the then-teenager if he would mind playing for him. The teen did. While he was playing, Paderewski tu rned to mrs. White and just smiled. That was all she needed to know that this young man would be going far with his talent and commitment. Not too long after that meeting, the boy's father lost his job. The boy had to stop his piano playing to go out and work to help support the fam-ily. Though he played on occasion, his dream to become a concert pia-nist had been replaced by what was happening in his world\u2014the need to help his family, to focus in dif-ferent directions and eventually go to war in support of his country. Th at boy's name was harry s. Truman, the 33rd president of the united states. Though he could have gone on to be a concert pianist, the challenges of his life took him in another direc-tion\u2014a direction that gave him a far greater impact than he probably ever imagined. I think this shows us that we may not know why certain things happen in our lives, but we should embrace change, move forward in a positive direction and discover what potential we have within us.

(Check with your doc to be sure of this.) If so, then if you are traveling to a destina-tion in a time zone within two to three hours of your home, you can ignore the time change and take your meds at the same clock time as you would have at home. In other words, if you take your meds at 7:00 am and 7:00 pm like me, you can stay on a 7:00 am/7:00 pm local time schedule if you travel up to three time zones away. If you travel farther than that, you may have to adjust your medicine taking schedule to a different local time. To take an extreme example, I've traveled 12 times zones away from my home and have simply reversed my medicine schedule so that I take my 7:00 am meds at the 7:00 pm local time, and vice versa. When I get home I'm back on my usual schedule and haven't missed taking any medications.

There is a lack of planning. f inally, many times your resolution will affect your family and inadvertently their behaviors will sabotage your efforts. The first step to making any lifelong change is to look at your present behavior. you need to completely understand how frequently you engage in the behavior you want to change. If your resolution is to improve your weight, you need to look at your diet and activity level. you need to know exactly what you are eating, when you are eating and how much time you spend eating, and if your eating is associated with any behaviors like feeling bored, anxious or upset when you eat. If your goal is to be more active, you need to know what time you spend engaged in activities above and beyond your daily routine. one strategy for understanding yourself is to spend one week keeping a log about the behavior you want to change. This will allow you to better understand your behavior and look for any trends. Be true to yourself during this week; do not alter your behavior and be honest in your recording. r ecord all that you eat, when you eat, estimate quantities of food and any emotion you are feeling while eating. y ou should also record the types of activities and how long you engage in them throughout the day . The next step is to examine your logs and look for trends. s ome examples of things to identify are: eating any one food too frequently, eating under stress, and eating late at night. f or example, are you drinking more than one or two six ounce sugar drinks like soda? Are you eating a lot of candy, not enough fruits or vegetables, too much bread or potato chips? Are you eating sufficient amounts of protein, like chicken, turkey and fish? h ow much red meat are your consuming in a week? Are you participating in any activity that is above and beyond your work day? how much time watching T v or working on the computer are you doing during the day? h ow often are you using an elevator? how close do you park to the front entrance of stores? Now you should select one thing you want to change about your eating and activity level. This change may be as small as drinking one less soda or eating one less serving of bread. An activity change may be parking further away from the entrance to a store, using the stairs, or doing some simple exercises during T v commercials or substituting a family walk for 30 minutes of Tv . Try to comply with these small changes until you no longer struggle to be compliant with the new behavior. It may take several weeks to make a permanent change towards a new and improved healthier lifestyle. Be patient with yourself. o nce you are ready, select another behavior to tackle. ever y six months, repeat your diet and activity logs and reexamine your behaviors in order to select the best changes to make.

Check your progress once every two to four weeks. Do not obsess over the scale every day unless you have been instructed to weigh yourself daily for a medical reason. The progress you make will depend on several factors, including your age, gender, amount of your body weight that is muscle, amount and degree of changes you make, an d your dedication to keeping your goal. keep in mind that any positive change you make in your diet or activity le vel is making you a healthier person. give yourself six to 12 months to really see changes and progress.

Balance is one of the many key components in weight management. This is important to think about when approaching your meals as well as your daily life. eating well is not the only component of this balance; exer cise and attitude can be very helpful too. Balance with snacks and meals can consist of planning ahead to ensure that you have carbohydrates, protein, and fat at each meal. Carbohydrates should consist of 50-60 percent of your meals while protein should consist of 20-25 percent of your meals and fat should consist of 20-25 percent of your meals. This is just one part of the meal; the second part should be choosing which carbohydrates, proteins and fats. s ome suggestions are listed below:weight management By Megan Tichy, RD carbohydrates: Aim for five to nine fruits and vegetables per day. In order to meet this goal, try including a fruit and vegetable at every meal and snack. Aim for fiber rich starches. grains with three grams of fiber or more are wonderful choices. Include non-fat or low-fat milk products at least once per day in a meal or snack. l ow fat or non-fat milk not only provide calcium, but also carbohydrates and protein.

NEXt PAgE PREViOUS PAgE cONtENtSTransplant Chronicles VOL. 14 NO. 1 \u0018 Returning to WORK after T ransplantation By Rebecca Hays, MSW, LCSW many people, although relieved at how much better they feel, are also disappointed that they don't feel as well as they did \"pre-illness.\" And, of course, this limbo-land of \"feeling better but not 100 percent\" makes returning to work a complicated process. fir st off, if you had to stop working because of your illness, I want to acknowledge that as a huge loss. There's a myth out there, and this may even exist in your family, that going on disability feels like a vacation. But most people tell me that stopping work was one of the most profound losses from getting sick: they miss the financial stability for themselves and their families, the sense of accomplishment at work, and the companionship of co-workers. you may have started to think about what it would be like to return to work. I want to build on that here. There is tons of evidence that working after transplantation helps people become more independent, brings in more income (obvious, eh?), and generally improves quality of life. It may even help you live longer. This does not mean that returning to work will be simple or quick. It's often scary at first\u2014and being worried about a \"failed\" return to work, or even a \"successful\" return, is normal. I want to emphasize that returning to work takes planning, teamwork, and resourcefulness. In this article, you'll read about several people's experiences; details of their situation, including names, have been changed to protect their privacy. Get your feet wet first: \"Juan,\" who got his transplant three years ago, found out that his long-term disability status at his job would end in a few months. he talked with his old boss about returning to work part-time at first (his union helped with this) got th e (tentative) ok to go back to his heavy-lifting, cold-weather job from his transplant coordinator and transplant nephrologist, and gave it a try. A year later, he came back to the transplant clinic to say how glad he was to be back at work. oth ers have created part-time \"jobs\" within their family or network of fr iends. \" rita,\" who got a kidney transplant last year, now babysits for her granddaughter two days a week. she is helping her family and gets exercise to boot. Certainly, including your family in the plan for increasing your activity is key\u2014you'll benefit from their support and teamwork. In rita 's case, she hopes to eventually earn more money with a job at a local preschool, and plans to run this idea by her transplant doctor. In addition to part-time work, there are other ways to gradually find out whether work will\u2014pardon the ex pression\u2014work. setting a daily schedule helps. Another way to \"start small\" is to volunteer for an agency that interests you\u2014this can be fun and is a handy reference for future job applications. Connecting with your local state or county department of vocational or occupational rehabilitation can help you think through options, and get additional training. Ask your transplant social worker for a referral. lif e options is a terrific resource for folks with kidney disease in thinking out a return-to-work plan; materials, including a humongous \"employment guide,\" are at www.lifeoptions.org or call 80 0.468.7777. The National kidney foundation has a rehabilitation brochure series through www. kidney.org or 800.622.9010. Although these materials are designed within the kidney community, they can be relevant for anyone living with transplant! for additional support, you can join a transplant listserv by e-mailing listserv@wuvmd.wustl.edu with the message: \"subscribe transplant.\" [Also see article on page 14 about e-mail support groups.]sINC e your T rANsPlANT, I hope you have more energy and more verve.

Click here to continue on page 8work & transplantation NEXt PAgE PREViOUS PAgE cONtENtS\u0018 Transplant Chronicles VOL. 14 NO. 1Think through how your health status and transplant may affect what you can do at work: you k now better than anybody how you feel. If you have concerns about how a particular symptom will affect your ability to work, plan to bring this up at your next check-up. Ask specific questions once you have a plan, or ev en a dream, in mind. for example, \"Bill,\" who got a kidney transplant six years ago, was offered a job in his friend's tree-trimming business. he talked with his transplant doctor about whether the amount of heavy lifting was ok, and whether the exposure to tree dust (Well, this isn't the technical word, I'm sure, but go with me here!) would be dangerous given his suppressed immune system. With minor accommodations\u2014like wearing a mask under certain circumstances\u2014the doctor gave him the go-ahead. How do I explain my transplant to employers? many people have asked on the listserv, \" how do I explain my illness to a future employer?\" and \"how do I explain that I've been out of work for years?\" first off, you don't \"have\" to explain anything to anybody\u2014it is, of course, against the law to discriminate against employees based on health status and, in problem situations, you ca n contact the equal employment opportunity Commission or a local health advocacy organization (one in Wi sconsin is called ABC for health). That said, if you've been out of the workforce for awhile, it helps to rehearse what you're looking for in a job now, what your skills are, and an (honest) explanation of what you've been doing lately. This is where volunteer work, new training/education, or new interests come in handy. A local job bank, or a local community college can help you practice what to say in interviews, on applications, or in your resume. In some cases, it makes sense to be up front. for example, \" larry\" lives ina rural area where everybody knows hi m and about his transplant. he decided to say something like, \" look, if I can keep track of 44 medicines a day, I can keep track of inventory\u2014I am way more organized than an ybody else around here. yeah, there may be an occasional day when I've got to call in sick. But overall I'm stable, and when I'm here, I'll be here 110 percent.\" It worked.Returning to WORK after T ransplantation continued from page 7 >> How work may affect your insurance benefits: There used to be a major \"trap\" where, once you became disabled, it was risky to go back to work, because you'd lose your health insurance benefits. In an old study, a third of heart transplant patients said this fear is what kept them from returning to work. There are now much better safeguards in place: 1. If you Are el IgIBle for ssDI and work, you can keep your medicare for at least eight and a half years, long after the cash benefits stop. Part A will continue for free; you have to continue to pay the premiums for Parts B and D. 2. If you go T A kIDNey TrANsPlANT, you will continue to qualify for medicare for three years after your transplant regardless of your work status or disability status. 3. If you Are el IgIBle for meDICAID AND Work, at least 28 states will allow you to \"buy-in,\" or purchase, medicaid for much less than the \"spend-down\" you might typically have to pay\u2014it works like an insurance premium. 4. ThANks To The heAlTh INsurANC e Por TABI lITy AND ACCouNT- ABIlITy ACT of 1996 , large employer group health plans (insurance offered through a job) can no longer turn you down, or charge you more, for having an expensive medical condition. There may be a preexisting condition clause for up to a year, in which you pay the premiums but do not get coverage for existing health problems (such as transplant). 5. If you h Ave he AlTh INsurANC e Through A JoB BuT Are IN A Preex IsTINg CoNDITI oN WAITIN g PerIoD, you can apply to the companies that make your medicine for assistance. you may also be able to get high-risk health insurance, offered through most states, at a reduced premium during this time\u2014though even the reduced rate can be expensive. for more information, check out www.ssa.gov/work/index.html an d look at topics such as \"What happens to my medicare benefits if I work?\" and \"What happens to my medicaid benefits if I work?\"work & transplantation Click here to continue on page 9visit www.transplantrecipients.org resources to read this and other articles.

These are forms that ask for he alth updates and are sent directly to you. social security collects information from you and from your medical team about how your health currently af fects your ability to work. keep in mind that both ssI and ssDI eligibility are based on being unable to work AN y job, not just the job you used to have. Certainly, having had a transplant will affect this disability review process\u2014if you qualified for disability solely on the basis of organ failure, you may no longer be considered disabled once yo u've recovered from the transplant surgery. of course, you may also have a collection of health conditions or symptoms that will be officially \"d isabling\" for the long term. either way, if you are earning ssI or ssDI, there are some helpful work incentive programs that can be a help if you give a return to work a try. As always in coping with chronic illness, it helps to plan ahead and learn what resources may be av ailable. you can sign up for a \"ticket to work,\" which then allows a \"trial work period\" for up to ni ne months, during which time your ssDI check is unaffected (though your ssI check may drop). you can use this trial period to enroll in job training/school and, for ssI recipients, write a \"plan for achieving self support,\" which can include assistance buying equipment for your own business. In addition, if you got ssDI, and your monthly work income drops below $830 per month any time in the next three years, you can get your disability check again that month. If a decline in your health means you have to stop work within six months, social security calls it an \"unsuccessful work effort\" an d benefit eligibility is unaffected. for more information, check out www.ssa.gov/work/ index.html for example, \" sam\" didn't think he would ever feel up to going back to work as a car mechanic\u2014 since his transplant, he feels tired sometimes and also su ffers from neuropathy. he also knew he wanted a job with health insurance. he connected with the Department of vocational rehabilitation in Wisconsin, enrolled in a Ticket to Work program, an d is now in training to be an x-ray technician. he figures his own extensive experience with the health care system gives him some \"inside scoop\" on me dical vocabulary and how the system works. his benefits have continued throughout his schooling, an d he will finish the program may 2007.

Jim Warrenfrom the editors of Transplant News By Jim Warren, editor and publisher Transplant News, edited and published by Jim Warren, is a twice-monthly newsletter for the transplant community focusing on developments in organ, tissue, eye and bone marrow procurement and transplantation. Transplant News Digest is written exclusively for quarterly publication in Transplant Chronicles. f or more information about Transplant News visit: www.trannews.com Deceased donors top 8,000 for first time; Record 31,184 trans- planted in U.S. in 2006 The number of organs donated and ultimately transplanted in the u.s. has grown steadily in the past four years, and 2006 proved to be another banner year, according to preliminary data announced by the federal government. for the first time ever, the number of deceased donors exceeded 8,000 in 2006 and, when coupled with the 6,723 organs donated by living donors, resulted in 31,184 organs transplanted, according to the hea lth resources and services Ad- mi nistration ( hrsA) of the Depart- me nt of health and human services (hhs). of the organs transplanted, 78.4 percent came from deceased donors and the remaining 21.6 percent from live donors. The number of Americans receiving kidney and liver transplants also set a record. A total of 17,084 kidney transplants were performed in 2006, which represented a 15.6 percent increase since 2002. In addition, a record number 6,650 liver trans-plants were performed, compared to 5,331 in 2002. The number of minority donors also increased slightly in 2006. African-Americans comprised 15.5 percent of deceased donors and hispanics 13.7 percent; hrsA pointed out both rates are slightly higher than th eir proportion of the overall u.s. population.The growth over the previous five years has been attributed mainly to th e success of the organ Donation Breakthrough Collaborative which, due to its success, is now called the org an Donation and Transplanta- tion Breakthrough Collaborative (oDT BC), managed by hrsA and the Alliance for organ Donation and Transplantation. Th e oDTBC held its learning ses- sion 2 on April 17-18 in Atlanta, gA, to launch the second phase of the collaborative. They introduced a goal of eliminating all deaths on the waiting list by the year 2013 by spreading known best practices to the nation's largest hospitals and to all transplant programs. The results of the first initiative underscore the optimism expressed that the goals are achievable. Con-sider: n over 300 hospitals in the u.s. have already achieved organ donation rates of 75 percent or greater for at least 12 months. man y other large hospitals, clus- tered in certain donation service ar eas (D sAs) also have average donation rates that are well above the national average. n Thirteen entire D sAs have been able to achieve an average 75 percent conversion rate for a 12-month period since the onset of the collaboratives. n Two D sAs have exceeded a rate (oTPD) of 3.75 or higher of organs transplanted per donor for at least eight months. Participants at the learning session were told that if 3,000 new kidneys were transplanted annually, this would eliminate the growth of the waiting list, and adding 4,000 annually would result in shrinking the list. To achieve that, each of th e nation's 58 D sAs would have to increase the number of kidneys procured by 10 per month for 12 months. Federal ruling opens way for more paired donations In a step that proponents say could save thousands of lives, the u.s. Jus- tice Department has cleared the way for hospitals to begin performing organ transplants in which multiple donors give kidneys to unrelated recipients. \"It's going to make dramatic dif- ference in removing barriers we've all faced trying to perform paired tr ansplants,\" said Dr. richard B. freeman, Chairman of the legisla- tive Committee of the American soc iety of Transplant surgeons and a surgeon at Tufts-New england medical Center in Boston. \"It's go- ing to really create a large number of kidney transplants, nationwide,\" sa id robert montgomery, an Associ- at e Professor of surgery and Director of Johns hopkins hospital's Com- prehensive Transplant Center. The Justice Department issued a memo saying that nothing in federal law prevents someone from donating an organ in exchange for having a relative or loved one receive an organ from someone else. las t year, 4,056 kidney patients died while awaiting transplants, ac-co rding to the united Network for organ sharing.

Th e gallup organization survey found that 53 percent of Americans have indicated their wish to donate on their driver's license or signed an organ donor card, almost double the 28 percent who had done so in 1993 when the last poll was taken. In addition, almost three-fourths (73 percent) said they would likely give permission to donate their organs regardless of whether they had taken action. Nearly all the survey respondents\u2014 97 percent\u2014said they would donate a family member's organs if they knew the person's wishes ahead of time, about the same response as in 1993; however, in 2005, 71 percent indicated they would donate a fam-ily member's organs when they did not know their wishes\u2014a signifi-cant increase over 1993 when only 47 percent said they would. \"The fact that 97 percent of respon- dents said they would donate a fam-ily member's organs if they knew their wishes ahead of time is huge,\" Ja mes Burdick, executive Director of the Division of Transplantation (DoT), told Transplant News Digest . \"The finding that 71 percent would donate even if they didn't know the family's wishes...is a 20 percent increase over 1993 findings.\" The news was not all good. The poll also found that disturbing and significant pockets of mistrust and misunderstanding still exist among minorities, particularly African Am ericans. for example, 61 percent of Caucasians were most likely to indicate their permission to donate on their driver's license, almost double the number of African-Americans (31 percent) will-in g to do so. other minorities were slightly more willing with latinos (39 percent) and Asians (39 percent) saying they would give permission on their licenses. The survey also found that beliefs do affect the willingness to donate. for example, the more than 50 percent who answered \"yes\" when asked if they believe organ donation can often transmit diseases such as hIv, hepatitis, West Nile virus were significantly less likely to donate. And the concept of brain death still remains a mystery to many, with more than 22 percent agreeing with the statement\u2014\"It is possible for a brain-dead person to recover from his or her injuries.\" This group was also significantly less willing to donate. Burdick admitted that brain death per se is not totally understood, but credited the public with be-ing \"a little smarter than we give them credit [for]\" and professed to be optimistic that progress is being ma de. for instance: \"We're working with the entertainment industry as closely as we can to keep their facts straight as possible,\" he said. \"The public often has the ability to see the more ridiculous\" plot lines in Tv s hows and movies. Not surprisingly, the current state of access to health care in the u.s. is reflected in the response to the qu estion\u2014\" given equal need, a poor person has as good a chance as a rich person of getting an organ transplant.\" A total of 52 percent disagreed or strongly disagreed with this statement, while 49.3 percent agreed or strongly agreed. Intestine transplants added to organs covered by HRSA Intestinal transplants have been added to the list of human organs co vered by the organ Procure- ment and Transplantation Network (oPT N) and the list of human or- ga ns defined in the National organ Transplant Act (N oTA). The announcement was made by elizabeth Duke, administrator of the health resources and ser- vi ces Administration ( hrsA) in the march 9, 2007 Federal Register. Th e final rule went into effect on that date. The new rule means that transplant programs that perform intestinal transplants must adhere to intes-tinal allocation policies developed by the oPTN and are subject to enforcement sanctions by the hhs if they fail to comply. Intestinal transplantation\u2014which may include the esophagus, stom-ach, small or large intestine, or any portion of the gastrointestinal tract\u2014is considered for patients with irreversible intestinal failure due to surgery, trauma, or acquired or congenital disease that cannot be managed through the intravenous delivery of nutrients, also referred to as total parenteral nutrition. The first successful intestinal trans- plant was performed in 1989. The oPT N adopted voluntary intesti- nal organ allocation policies and began maintaining a list of patients waiting for intestinal transplants in 19 93. on December 31, 1993, there were only 43 candidates on the waiting list for an intestinal trans-plant, compared to 169 patients on the list in 2003. The number of intestinal trans- plants performed has more than tripled in the past decade; how-ever, the volume of transplants per transplant center is relatively small, hr sA noted in the Federal Registe r announcement. Ten transplant centers performed one or more intestinal transplants in 2002 and only five performed more than 10 transplants. The overall median waiting time was 319 days for pa-tients added to the list in 2001. In 2005, there were 178 intestinal tr ansplants in the u.s., the high- est number ever. There were 175 performed in 2006.

Thirty- eight percent of those were between the ages of 13 and 17. The key to caring for adolescents who undergo transplantation is understanding their stage of development. It is normal for adolescents to experim-ent with risky behaviors, including not being compliant with their medical needs. Teens strive to gain a separate identity from their parents, or other authority figures, and have difficulty understanding and accepting things that are not concrete and detailed. Teens who have difficulty following their medical care plan after transplant are at higher risk for rejection or loss of their transplanted organ. Not only do teenagers with transplants have all the struggles that their peers do, they have additional worries and responsibilities. The most common areas of concern are with taking medications (including dealing with side effects), getting blood drawn for lab tests, and clinic visits with their physicians, which takes time away from school. Problems can arise simply due to forgetfulness, feeling sad or powerless, or from lack of trust in the medical st aff. simply put, if it doesn't taste good, hurts, is scary, or is a hassle, it will be difficult to convince a teenager they have to do it. Parents of all adolescents struggle with the transition from childhood to adulthood, however, parents of chronically ill children are often more resistant to this transition. It is vitally important that teens be involved in medical decisions and caring for themselves so they have some degree of control over their situation. Proper supervision until the child is ready to act independently is critical. The age that independence occurs is different for every child; however, they need to know from the very beginning what the consequences will be if they do not cooperate wi th the medical care plan. h ere aresome ways to help teenagers move toward independence: l EdUcATE T EENs ABOUT THEIR ILLNE ss and give them some control by including them in decisions regarding their transplant care. l sOmE THING s ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE , as in taking medications, obtaining blood tests and seeing the doctor. l IF cOm p LIcATION s OccUR FROm NOT TAKING mEdIcA- TION s, encourage discussion of why this happened and how to prevent it from happening again. Do not place blame. l BE HONE sT A Nd HOpEFUL about their health and future. l sEEK pR OFE ssIONAL HELp for behaviors that affect physical or psychological health.

It started with the people I knew post-transplant from my transplant center. I asked the social worker for permission to start an \"in-person\" post-transplant support group and th e hospital gave me an ok! s hortly after I started the support group, several people who were waiting wanted to know what the \"post\" thing was all about, and wanted more information about after-transplant problems and side effects. so th is group expanded to include pre-transplant individuals. It was like two different worlds before and after transplant. I met a kidney and pancreas transplant re cipient, Jennifer s utt (kP recipient, December 23, 2002). Jennifer and I think and feel the same way. We both want to help and support ot hers. s he was a facilitator for the kidney and kidney/pancreas support groups at our transplant center.

Shieck, RN, BSN, CCTN pre-Transplant: Depending on the type of organ transplant that is needed, the ph ysical symptoms will vary. for example, many children waiting for a kidney, heart or liver transplant may have fatigue. Depending on the degree of fatigue, many children are not able to participate in a full day at school. If your child is having any difficulties participating in school activities or is missing an excessive amount of school due to illness, it might be necessary to talk with the school about a modified school schedule or to start homebound teaching. As a parent or guardian, you should work to develop good communication with your child's teacher, school nurse, principal and transplant team regarding these issues. The school will likely request that any special accommodations be made in writing and be signed by th e child's physician. members of the transplant team and members of the school staff may need to communicate with each other about your child's accommodations, so you will likely be asked to sign a release of information form so that this can occur. The school will require some medical history and information on your child's current health issue in order to provide the appropriate support. The transplant team works very hard to protect your child's privacy. If you have any questions or concerns, talk with the transplant team in advance to review what information will be shared. If your child has been scheduled or listed for a transplant, let the school know the possible date of the transplant (if it is going to be a live donor transplant). An important thing to keep in mind is that your child's participation in school is not only for education, bu t also socialization. seeing and keeping in touch with friends is an important aspect of a child's mental health. It may be worthwhile to consider a reduced school schedule in which the child continues to attend class for even just a few hours a day so that he or she can maintain their social contacts. post-Transplant: Within several days of your child having a transplant, you should contact the school to inform them that the transplant has occurred. If possible, let the school know approximately how long your child will be out. Depending on the type of transplant, most children will be out of school for about 6 to 12 we eks after transplantation. you should consult with your transplant nurse coordinator to determine how long your child will be out. Homebound Teaching: homebound teaching is a situation in which a teacher from your child's public school district comes to your house and helps your child with cl assroom assignments. your public school district should be able to offer a homebound teacher when requested by a physician. Be aware that visits made by the homebound teacher are very limited and may only be about an hour or two per week. The homebound teacher will obtain some of the school work directly from your child's teacher(s), and your child will be responsible for completing as much of the work as possible during the rest of the week. Private schools do not typically have homebound teachers, but they may be able to make some I ThINk ThAT All of us h Ave some fo ND memor Ies of our school days, whether they we re grade school or high school. going to school is a big part of being a child. for children who have chronic illnesses, school is especially important\u2014not just for learning, but for socialization an d maintaining a sense of normalcy. so, let's start from the beginning and look at what you as a parent or guardian will need to do to help your child through some of the daily school challenges.transplantation & schoo l some children are excited to get back to school, but many parents are concerned about their health.

As the dose of these medications decrease, the concentration problems should improve. Do not be surprised if your child needs a nap after working on their homework. This is normal. Also, long hospitalizations can cause deconditioning. Just being in the hospital and lying in bed can wear children out, and it may take several weeks for them to start regaining their energy. Returning to school: returning to the classroom is a great sign of progress and that life is slowly returning to \"normal.\" som e children are excited to get back to school, but many parents are concerned about their health. Prior to your child returning to the classroom, you should contact his or her teacher(s) and school nu rse. update them on the current medical problems, and let them know if there are any medications that need to be given while at sc hool. let them know that if your child has been exposed to any communicable infections (such as chicken pox), you should be notified at once. your transplant nurse coordinator will give you guidelines at the time of discharge regarding what types of infections to be co ncerned about. your transplant team will also need to send a letter to your child's school giving your child permission to return to the classroom. The letter should include the transplant type and date, a list of current medications with doses, a note about any medical needs that your child might require while at school (example: having the blood pressure or glucose readings done during school hours), and if there is any special equipment needed during school (example: a wheelchair). sch ool attendance is taken very seriously these days, but good communication between your family, the school, and the transplant team can easily resolve mo st issues. remember that, while they are responsible for any missed assignments when away from school for clinic visits, lab draws, hospitalizations, or illnesses, your child cannot be penalized for the actual absence. If you feel that the school is unfairly penalizing your child for medically-related absences, inform your transplant team. you r transplant team is here to assist you, your child, and your family in many aspects of care, including the significant transition back to the classroom. Be sure to let them know how they can be of help to you. TC Cindy K.

WN v is now in most of the united states. The most common way people become infected is through the bite of an infected mosquito. People who have received a transplant may be at significantly higher risk for developing serious outcomes of WNv disease, including meningitis, encephalitis, or possibly death. The disease West Nile virus causes a seasonal epidemic in North America that flares up in the summer and continues into th e fall. People infected with WN v may develop serious and sometimes life-altering or even life-threatening illnesses that require hospitalization, such as West Nile encephalitis and West Nile meningitis (conditions associated with inflammation of the brain or the area around the brain) or We st Nile polio-like paralysis. WN v disease occurs between three and 14 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. sym ptoms of severe WN v disease include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness, and paralysis. sym ptoms can last several weeks, and neurological effects can be permanent. In the general population, usually there are no symptoms wi th WN v, but it may cause less severe illness with fever, headache, body aches, nausea, or vomiting. som etimes this includes a skin rash on the chest, stomach, and back. These symptoms typically last a few days, but may last several weeks. There is no specific treatment fo r WN v disease. Human vaccines for WN v are still in the early stages of development. Transplant recipients are at increased risk of severe West Nile virus disease medicines taken by transplant recipients can make it hard to fight infections. Transplant recipients may develop the severe forms of WNv disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, and even death, more often than persons with normal immune systems. special considerations for Transplant Recipients WNv disease should be considered in any transplant recipient with unexplained fever and/or neuro-logical symptoms during mosquito season. This is true, even for recipi-ents who develop the symptoms long after their transplant. Contact your health care provider a s soon as possible if you think you have symptoms of West Nile virus infection. Immunosuppressed recipients may h ave longer incubation periods, delayed development of antibod-ies, and an increased likelihood of getting severe disease compared to people who are not immunosup-pressed. AvOId mOsQUITO BITE s! n Look for repellents with EPA-regis-tered active ingredients : repellents containing D e eT (N, N-diethyl-mtoluamide), picaridin (kBr 3 023), or oil of lemon eu- calyptus (p-menthane 3,8-diol) typically provide longer-lasting protection than other products. Permethrin is registered for use on clothing, shoes, bed nets, and camping gear, though not directly on skin. It can provide protection through several washings. n wear clothing that can help re- duce mosquito bites Wear long sleeves, long pants, and s ocks whenever possible outdoors. mos quitoes may bite through thin clothing, so consider spraying clothes with repellent (including permethrin) for extra protection. n Be aware of peak mosquito hours The hours from dusk to dawn are p eak mosquito biting times. you can get bites even during a short time outdoors. Take extra care to use repellent and protective clothing.West Nile Virus West Nile Virus West Nile Virus West Nile Virus The following information was just released from the health resources & services Administration, u.s.

A cruise to a small island to enjoy the golden sun, Enjoy the sites, the clubs at night, have lots and lots of fun. My girlfriend wants to take me out so we can celebrate. We'd eat and drink and laugh and cry and stay out very late. If I had won the lottery there'd be a big \"to-do,\" For everyone who knows the things that we have both been through. A band and ballroom dancing, I'd have Whitney Houston sing, A tribute to your life and to the special joy you bring. While making preparations to give thanks for one more year, I thought of what you did for me and stopped to shed a tear. Someone whom I have never met who gave unselfishly, A gift that no one else could give, a perfect match for me. I woke up on our special day and it was very clear, There'd be no night on the town, no fanfare and no cheer. I'll light a candle to you and your lovely family, Who hold you in their hearts always in loving memory. Your Mom told me you did enjoy the taste of ice cold beer, I raise my Michelob to you, and to another year.

PREViOUS PAgE cONtENtS This is one of many examples of how our pharmacist has been wonderful: my son needed a form of medicine that had to stay cold. I knew that condition would not fit into our li festyle. from experience with my other children, I knew I could forget medicines that had to be kept in the re frigerator. so I told my pharmacist the problem, and he said he could make this particular medicine so that it would be stable for two weeks. This way it would not need to be refriger-ated or put on ice when we traveled. That made life easier and also en-sured that my son got all the medi-cines he required on time. my son was born with congenital heart disease. he had a heart trans- plant two weeks before his second birthday. I already knew the value of an experienced pharmacist because my son had been on some type of medication his whole life. When he was one year old we moved to a new town. As soon as I knew the area we would be living in, I found a pharma-cy. I made sure we had a pharmacist even before we had a house to live in. That is how necessary I knew it was. I picked a local pharmacy with the same person to help me each time. I went in with paper copies of my son's prescriptions to make sure the phar-macy could stock his medicines.When my son was transplanted 15 years ago, his medical team would not discharge him until they had talked to our pharmacist. After the heart transplant surgeon and the cardiologist, our pharmacist has been the most important medical profes-sional involved in my son's life. These are a few things you should consider when deciding if you have the right pharmacy to help with your transplant prescriptions: n If you do not have a good phar- macist, find one you can trust before yo ur operation. explain that you or a loved one will have a transplant and make sure they can get the medicines you will need. n your pharmacist needs to be will- ing to talk to you, listen to you and not be so busy they cannot discuss your special needs. n make every effort to have a one-on-one relationship with your pharmacist. our pharmacist has caught, on more than one occasion, prob- lems or possible issues with my son's medicines. A doctor had prescribed an antibiotic that did not interact well with my son's immunosuppression medicines. our pharmacist spotted a problem and prevented a possible deadly si tuation. he called the doctor requesting that a different antibiotic be used. Tell your pharmacist if you are having a problem with your medicines. They may have an idea that helps. When my son was first transplanted, he was so small he needed a pediatric dose of medicine that had to be mixed using a mortar an d pestle. our pharmacist mixed liquid cherry syrup with the crushed ta blets. on my next visit he asked how my son liked it. I told him he made a face and it was hard to get hi m to take a dose. our pharmacist sent an employee to the grocery store to buy wild cherry syrup for th e mixture. my son had no problem taking the medicine the next time. A good pharmacist can also detect when a patient may not be taking their medicines correctly. Teenage compliance is a real problem. When my son got older, it was our pharmacist who noticed that my son was not taking one of his medicines. The pharmacy records indicated that the medicine had not needed to be refilled as it should have been. Carry the pharmacist's telephone nu mber with you. often it is easier to contact them than it is the transplant coordinator if you just need a refill while out of town. It is best to give your pharmacy a call three or four days before your refill is due so they will have it on hand and you don't have to wait while they fill your medicines. eve ry pharmacist is human and can make mistakes. Take the time to check that your medicines are the right color, size or number. mos t important: find a great pharm- acist. my son has one. "}
