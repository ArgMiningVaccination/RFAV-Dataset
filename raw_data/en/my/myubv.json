It comes in the form of a white, odorless, bitter-tasting, crystalline powder that easily dissolves in water. Crystal meth can be snorted, smoked, or injected. Most often, the drug is smoked for quick and easy access. Once in the user's system, crystal meth causes three effects: euphoria, increased energy, and a decreased appetite. Crystal meth is an attractive drug to many people because of the intensity and longevity of the drug's effects. Additionally, the drug is one of the most widely available and relatively affordable compared to similar drugs, such as cocaine. [Crystal meth](/detox/crystal-meth/) is one of the most addictive substances in the country, accounting for more than half a million regular users in the United States. Even more devastating is that the drug affects the lives of people as young as 12 years old, and more than 13 million people in the country have tried crystal meth. The intense effects of crystal meth reinforce use, and many people report being [addicted](/addiction-treatments/) after their first time trying the drug. Like other substances, crystal meth puts a person into a never-ending cycle of use to avoid the symptoms of non-use and withdrawal. A person who uses meth experiences the following: A person on crystal meth perceives a heightened level of energy and overall well-being, but other signs are noted by those around the person, such as the following: Long-term, chronic use of crystal meth causes permanent damage to the body and brain, such as the following: One of the most unfortunate effects of long-term use, though, is that the brain is no longer able to process dopamine as effectively. Dopamine is a natural brain chemical responsible for creating feelings of pleasure. The rush of crystal meth occurs because the drug rapidly releases large volumes of dopamine that must be processed by specific receptors. Over time, the constant stress placed on the receptors causes irreversible damage. The damage to the receptors is often permanent, so the person may experience only minimal feelings of pleasure and reward. Detoxification is meant to help you stop using the drug as safely and quickly as possible. It also helps relieve the withdrawal symptoms that range from mild to severe. Because of the chance of complications with detox and withdrawal from crystal meth, medical supervision is highly recommended to ensure one's safety, well-being, and success. Detox from crystal meth normally does not result in physical symptoms, but the medical team can administer medications should physical symptoms appear. The emotional symptoms, though, can be severe, which is why many people fail to stop on their own. The medical staff closely monitors the detox process and intervenes as needed. The most common symptoms of crystal meth detox are as follows: Meth withdrawal follows a predictable timeline. Symptoms typically begin within 24 hours after the last dose. They reach their peak after 7 to 10 days of abstinence. After 14 to 20 days, they disappear. Although detox symptoms are uncomfortable and often dangerous, they can be managed at a medical detox center.
