On Caucasian skin, it appears as bright red lesions in body folds. It may appear smooth and shiny. Many people with inverse psoriasis have another type of [psoriasis](/understanding-psoriatic-disease/) elsewhere on the body at the same time. Symptoms Inverse psoriasis is found in the armpits, groin (including the [genitals](/genitals/)), under the breasts, and in other skin folds on the body.

Triggers Common triggers for inverse psoriasis include: - Certain medicines - Starting and stopping medicines - Infections - Injury to the skin - Stress - Tobacco or alcohol use - Friction on deep skin folds "}
