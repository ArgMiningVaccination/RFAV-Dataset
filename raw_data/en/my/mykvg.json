With so many people frequently out sick, schools and businesses strug - gled to adjust. Absenteeism sky - rocketed, setting back student learning, exacerbating inequities, and costing U.S. businesses an estimated $1 billion per week. 1 As manufacturing and distribu - tion facilities closed due to out - breaks, supply chains were dis - rupted and have yet to recover. With all this turmoil across the world, the lighting industry pos - sesses an underutilized part of the solution: germicidal ultravio - let disinfection, or GUV for short. Early in the pandemic, the lighting industry moved quickly to bring this relatively old tech - nology to the forefront to help. GUV disinfection has been used in buildings as far back as the 1930s, where it was proven to reduce the spread of measles in Philadelphia schools. However, its usage waned over time with the further development of antibiotics and vaccines, and the absence of any major pandemics. More recently, GUV has been used in niche health - care applications like operating rooms, as well as in places like homeless shelters, to reduce the spread of tuberculosis. At the onset of the pandemic in 2020, seeing the opportunity for GUV, lighting manufactur - ers rushed to develop new GUV solutions. Lighting industry associations including the IES and the International Ultraviolet Association (IUVA) moved quickly to develop new stan - dards. Despite these efforts, sev - eral manufacturers have reported that GUV did not experience significant adoption or sales, with some manufacturers reportedly pulling back on their investments in the technology. What hap - pened and why was the technol - ogy not more widely adopted? One challenge is that although GUV is an old technology, it is lacking in many aspects needed to support its deployment. Consensus industry standards for how to test, evaluate and report the performance of GUV technology and products did not exist early in the pandemic. Neither did design and installa - tion guidelines for its use. This situation is rapidly improving. Over the past year, several stan - dards to test and characterize the technology have been pub - lished by IES and the IUVA with more on the way. Meanwhile, application, installation and com - missioning guidelines have been under development by ASHRAE committee GPC 37 and should be released in the next year. These standards and guidelines will be a big help. '' We know that GUV works to disinfect for pathogens, but we did not know how well it works compared to other measures BEYOND THE STANDARDS , however, GUV technology lacks a clear value proposition that potential buyers need to make decisions. We know from the basic science that GUV works to disinfect for pathogens, but we did not know how well it works in practice , or particularly how well it works in comparison to other measures used to disinfect buildings such as chemicals, air cleaners or increased building ventilation. Fortunately, this work to bet - ter understand GUV effective - ness is under way and the value proposition is now coming into view. For our part, my organiza - tion, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), has been investigating how GUV compares to ventila - tion-based measures to reduce infection risk in buildings. We published a paper along with co - authors from Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Harvard Medical School in August 2022: \"Energy Implications of Using Upper Room Germicidal Ultraviolet Radiation and HVAC Strategies to Combat SARS-CoV-2.\" 2 The paper dove deep into what is known about how GUV com - pares to HVAC-based ventilation measures recommended by organizations including ASHRAE and the CDC to reduce the risk of infection from SARS-CoV-2.

These are astounding increases to energy use, operating costs and greenhouse gas emis - sions. The need to create and maintain indoor environments that mitigate the transmission of airborne pathogens is critical and so are building energy and decarbonization goals needed to address climate change. Our findings support that not only is GUV more effective than PNNL research finds upper-room GUV is more effective and energy efficient than increased outdoor air fraction or air changes to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in buildings. Image: Courtesy of PNNL SSL quality expert, Dr. Shelly Miller of the University of Colorado, highlighted the promising role for GUV in improving indoor air quality. Miller noted that GUV is already broadly adopted to disinfect and provide clean drinking water, in part due to its endorsement by the EPA for that purpose. Miller suggested this level of endorsement is needed to support broader adoption of GUV for indoor air quality appli - cations. Additional efforts are under way within DOE and at PNNL. In addition to our work char - acterizing the GUV effective - ness and energy efficiency opportunity, we are dusting off DOE's CALiPER product testing program, which was launched over a decade ago to evaluate early-to-market LED products. CALiPER independently tests commercially available products and publishes findings. For the first visible-light LED products of 10 to 15 years ago, the CALiPER program was a power - ful tool to educate the market on how to test, evaluate and report product performance, reduce inflated or inaccurate perfor - mance claims, and support the adoption of newly developed industry standards. This same effort is needed today with GUV products. You'll see multiple rounds of CALiPER test results of GUV products published in the coming year. We'll also be conducting several field evalu - ations of GUV installations and publishing case studies detailing what we learn. It's important to recognize that with all the poten - tial benefits GUV can provide, it also has some characteris - tics that must be considered in its application, including photobiological safety, material degradation, and operation and maintenance practices. We'll be digging in on all of these issues and more and you'll be able to follow our work at https://www . energy.gov/eere/ssl/germicidal - ultraviolet-disinfection . Though some in the industry have become disillusioned about GUV technology after lackluster early sales, I think we are just getting started. The evidence continues to grow about the contributions GUV can make to address some of the great - est challenges we face in this country and the world: preparing for future biological threats and pandemics, improving public health inequities and outcomes, addressing worker safety and shortages, improving worker productivity, improving student learning and achievement, helping address supply-chain challenges, and decarbonizing buildings to fight climate change. GUV is part of the solution for all of these. I'd encourage everyone in the lighting industry to stay invested in this important tech - nology, support its continued development and get yourself educated. The potential benefits to the lighting industry are large, with multiplicative benefits to our health, safety, energy and decar - bonization goals as a country.
