However, Chinese older adults are underrepresented in most studies on neurol ogical symptoms. This study aims to examine the prevalence of neurologi cal symptoms among U.S. Chinese older adults. Methods: Data were drawn from the PINE study, a population-based survey of U.S Chinese older adults in the greater Chicago area. Guided by a community-based participatory research approach, a total of 3,159 Chinese older adults aged 60 and above were surveyed. Clinical review of system (ROS) was used to assess the presence of dizzine ss, syncope/fainting, fall, seizures, weakness, numbness, tingling, tremor, and stiffness. Results: Neurological symptoms were commonly experienced by U.S Chinese older adults (50 .6%). Symptoms as dizziness (31.0%), numbness (19.0%), and falls (14.8%) were commonly reported. Participants we re more likely to report any neurological symptom if they were older , less educated, low income, w ith poorer self-perceived health status, poorer quality of life, and worsened health change over last year. Conclusions: Neurological symptoms are common among Chinese ol der adults in the U.S. Future longitudinal research is needed to examine risk factors a nd health outcomes associated with neurological symptoms.

Introduction The presence of symptoms is important indicator to assess individual's overall health status and quality of life [1]. Neurological symptoms are asso ciated with physical disc omfort, impairment of motor function, poor cognitive abi lities, and socially dysfunction [2,3]. However, many onset neurological symptoms are often in tractable to recognize or manage: one third of the outpatients in neurology clinics have symptoms poorly explained by organic diseas e [4]; Moreover, older adults 36 AIMS Medical Science V olume 2, Issue 1, 35-50. with neurological symptoms are lik ely not actively seeking for medical attention [5]. Therefore, a systematic overview of the prevalence of cross-dis ease neurological symptoms is necessary so as to offer a more apposite evaluation of the health burden caused by neurological symptoms. Older adults are particularly at risk of suffering from the ne gative health consequences of neurological symptoms, some of which are expected as part of th e normal aging process and others are abnormal signs of neurological disorders and other health risks [6]. Despit e the increased risk of suffering from negative symptoms caused by ne urological disorders while aging [7-9], some neurological symptoms, for instance, dizziness and falls, were commonly considered syndromes because they are multifactorial and caused by pa thology within as well as beyond the nervous system [10]. We followed the orga nization of the Review of System, and included those syndromes in our analysis because these syndromes often have strong implications on the function of the neurological system. Similar as other neurological symptoms, the presence of those syndromes can be the early signs of neurologi cal deficiency or indicating nega tive outcomes projected on the neurological functioning. For ex ample, fall and dizziness may cause brain injuries, and render negative impact on neurological system. The presence of above-mentioned neurological symptoms and syndromes elicited negative influence on the physical and mental well-being of ol der adults [11-13]. Given that more than half of the older adults are with one or more chronic conditions [14], it is more than important to identify the presence of neurological symptoms and alleviate relevant health burden among older adults in the management of multiple chronic diseases. However, insufficient efforts have been made on evaluating the overall hea lth burden based on a systematic a ssessment of neurological symptoms whereas a great number of studies have evaluated the prevalence of diagnosed neurological disorders. Most existing studies examined a single neurol ogical disease [7-9], or a single neurological syndrome or symptom, including dizziness, fainting, falls, weakness, etc [5,15-18]. Older adults from Asian communities are often under-represented in most research and are consistently treated as a homogeneous group, whic h failed to acknowledge differences in cultural beliefs, health behaviors, and genetic inhere nce among diverse subgroups [19]. Only based on diagnosed neurological disease or diseases sets can render the poten tial bias of under-diagnose, for instance, there being inconsistent findings with regards to Chines e older adults' ri sk of having dementia compared to Caucasians [20-22]. While a few studies assessed neurological symptoms among certain Chinese population, su ch as printing workers and pers ons with schizophrenia [23,24], little is known in regards to the preval ence of neurological symptoms among the community-dwelling Chinese populati on domestically or globally. The Chinese community is the oldest and largest Asian American subgroup in the U.S [25]. Older adults constitute a large segment of the general Chines e population in the U.S, of whom 15.4% are aged 65 or older [25]. More than 80 % of Chinese older adults were foreign-born, and approximately 30 % of them immigrated to the U.S. after the age of 60 [25] . Psychological, social, and environmental changes associated with immi grating to U.S may have great influence on the presence and development of neurological disorders [26]. However, the vast intra-group diversity in language, education level, socioeconomic status, and degree of acculturation among U.S. Chinese older adults have resulte d in lim ited evidence-based research targeting this group [27]. Prior studies suggested Chinese older adu lts are disproportionally burde ned from co-morbidity, and cardiopulmonary and musculoskeletal symptoms [28-30] . To build upon the soci al and health issues documented in previous research with U.S. Chinese older adults [31-33], there is a particular need to 37 AIMS Medical Science V olume 2, Issue 1, 35-50. assess the presence of clinical symp toms experienced by this population. In this study, we aim to 1) evaluate the prevalen ce of neurological symptoms within the context of a large population-based cohort of U.S. Chinese older adults; 2) examine the correlations between the prevalence of neurological symptoms and socio- demographic characteristics; and 3) examine the correlations between the prevalence of neurological symptoms and self -reported health and quality of life measures. 2. Materials and Method 2.1. Population and settings The Population Study of Chinese Elderly in Chicago (PINE) is a population-based epidemiological study of U.S. Chinese older adults aged 60 and over in the gr eater Chicago area. The purpose of the PINE study is to collect community-l evel data of U.S. Ch inese older adults to examine the key cultural determinants of health and well-being. The project was initiated by a synergistic community-academic collaboration among Rush Institute for Healthy Aging, Northwestern University, and many community-based social services agencies and organizations throughout the greater Chicago area [34]. In order to ensure study relevance to the we ll-being of the Chinese community and enhance community participation, the PINE study implem ented culturally and linguistically appropriate community recruitment strategies strictly guid ed by a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach [35]. Over twenty social serv ices agencies, community centers, health advocacy agencies, faith-based organizations , senior apartments and social clubs served as study recruitment sites. Eligible participants were approached duri ng routine social service and outreach efforts serving Chinese Americans families in the Chicago city a nd suburban areas. All participants were consented and interviewed by trained bicultura l research assistants in Englis h or Chinese dialects, including Mandarin, Cantonese, Toishaness, and Teochow, accord ing to respondents' preference. Out of 3,542 eligible participants, 3,159 agreed to participate in the study, yi elding a response rate of 91.9 %. Based on the available census data drawn from U.S. Census 2010 and a random block census project conducted in the Chicago's Chinese comm unity, the PINE study is representative of the Chinese aging population in the great er Chicago area with respect to key demographic attributes, including age, sex, income, educa tion, number of children, and country of origin [36]. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Rush University Medical Center. 2.2. Measurements 2.2.1. Socio-demographics Basic demographic information was collected, including age (in years), sex, education level, annual income (in USD), marital status, number of children, living arrangement, and country of origin. Immigration data relating to participants' y ears in the U.S. and year s residing in the current community were also collected. Education level wa s assessed by asking participants the years of highest educational level completed. We created a dichotomous variable using \"China\" and \"other\" to distinguish respondents who were born in main land China from those who were born in other 38 AIMS Medical Science V olume 2, Issue 1, 35-50. countries. Living arrangement was assessed by aski ng participants how many people live in their household besides themselves and wa s categorized into four groups: 1) living alone; 2) living with 1-2 persons; 3) living with 2-3 persons; and 4) liv ing with 4 more persons. Self reported annual income was categorized into four groups : 1) $0-$4,999 per year; 2) $5,000-$9,000 per year; 3) $10,000-$14,999 per year; and 4) more than $15,000 per year. 2.2.2. Overall health status, quality of life, and health changes over the last year Overall health status was measured by \"In gene ral, how would you rate your health?\" on a four point scale (1 = poor; 2 = fair; 3 = good; 4 = very good). Quality of life was assessed by asking \"In general, how would you rate your quality of life?\" on a four point scale (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 = very good). Health change in last year was measured by the quest ion \"Compared to one year ago, how would you rate your health now?\" on a five point scale (1 = much worse; 2 = somewhat worse; 3 = about the same; 4 = somewhat better; 5 = much better than one year ago) . Health changes were then categorized into three groups: 1) improved health; 2) same health; and 3) worsened health. 2.3. Data Analysis Descriptive univariate statistics were used to summarize socio-demographic characteristics and the prevalence of neurological symp toms. In bivariate analyses, Chi-squared tests were used to compare socio-demographic characteristics betw een persons with and without neurological symptoms. The prevalence of each neurological symptom was calculated. Pearson Correlation coefficients were used to examine the correlati ons between socio-demographic and self-reported health variables and neurological symptoms. All statistical anal yses were conducted using SAS, Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). 2.3.1. Neurological Symptoms. We used the Review of Systems (ROS) to assess the neurological symptoms among our participants [37]. ROS is a list of questions organized by organ syst ems used by health-care providers for eliciting a medical history from a patient. Neurological system was a ssessed by asking whether participants have had following symptoms in the pa st: 1) dizziness, 2) sync ope/fainting, 3) falls, 4) seizures, 5) weakness, 6) numbness, 7) tin gling, 8) tremor, and 9) stiffness. The organization of Review of System is rec ognized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Content validity was assessed by a group of bilingual and bicultural study researchers with expertise in Chinese cultural is sues, health, and aging. The original English versions of the instruments were first translated into Chinese by a bilingual research team. Du e to the vast linguistic diversity of our study population, the Chinese vers ion was then back translated by bilingual and bicultural investigators fluent in dialects including Mandarin and Ca ntonese to confirm consistency in the meaning of the Chinese version with the original English version. Both written scripts (traditional and simplified Chinese characters) were subsequently examined. The community advisory board (CAB) led by an experienced bilingual and bicultural geriatrician then went over the wording of the Chinese versions to ensure validity. 39 AIMS Medical Science V olume 2, Issue 1, 35-50. 3. Results 3.1.1. Sample Characteristics Of the 3,159 participants enrolled in the PINE study, 58.9% were women, 71.3% were married, and 85.1 % had an annual income below $10,000. The mean age of participants was 72.8 (SD = 8.3) and the mean years of education completed was 8.7 (SD = 5.1). Approximately half of the participants ( N = 1597) reported having at least one neurology symptom. Significant differences were presented betw een participants with and without neurological symptoms in regards to age ( p < 0.001), gender (p < 0.001), education(p<0.001), income (p < 0.001), marital status ( p < 0.001), living arrangement (p < 0.01), years in U.S and community ( p < 0.05), overall health status ( p < 0.001), quality of life ( p < 0.001), and health changes over last year (p < 0.001) (Table 1).

Prevalence of Neurological Symptoms by Socio-Demographic Characteristics Neurological symptoms were more prevalen t among the older age groups (Table 3). The prevalence of neurological symptoms was 44. 5% among older adults aged 60-64, 44.2% among older adults aged 65-69, 52.5% among older adu lts aged 70-74, 53.0% among older adults aged 75-79, 57.1% among older adults aged 80-84, and 62.0% among the older adults aged 85 and over. Females are more like to report neurologica l symptoms than males (56.7% vs. 41.7%). Table 3.

With regards to education leve l, the highest prevalence of any neurological symptom (65.6%) was reported by participants with 0 years of education. In contrast, ol der adults with 17 or more years of education completed presented the lowest pr evalence of neurological symptoms (44.8%). Moreover, higher prevalence of ne urological symptoms was reporte d by participants with lower income. The prevalence of neurological symp tom was 51.9% and 54.0% am ong the two groups with annual income lower than $10,000, and 41.0% among participants with annual income $10,000 -$14,999, 38.2% among participants with annual income $15,000-$19,999, and 21.8% among participants with annua l income $20,000 or over. 3.1.4. Prevalence of Neurological Sy mptoms by Health Status Overall, neurological symptoms were less likely to be reported by participants who perceived their health status as very good (21.4%) or good (34.8%), comparing to older ad ults perceiving their health status as fair (54.6%) or poor (77.1%) (Table 4). Similar tre nd was presented with regards to quality of life: particip ants who perceived their quality of life as very good (41.7%) or good (46.3%) were less likely to reported neurological symptoms compared with participants with fair (54.8%) or poor quality of life (67.3%). In addition, a larger proportion of older adults with worsened health status over the past year (65.6 %) reported neurology symptom than those with no health change (37.7%) and improved health (8.5%) Table 4.

In addition, poorer overall health status (r = 0.32, p < 0.001), poorer quality of life ( r = 0.11, p < 0.001), and worsened health status changes over the past year ( r = 0.24, p < 0.001) were correlated with hi gher prevalence of neurological symptoms. 4. Discussion As the first population-based st udy of neurological symptoms among U.S. Chinese older adults, we found that neurological symptoms were comm on among U.S. Chinese older adults. Dizziness was the most commonly presented neurological symptoms, followed by numbness and falls. Participants were more likely to report neurological symptoms if they were older, female, with lower education and income level, unmarried, having more children, residing fewer years in the community, with poorer health status, quali ty of life, and worsened health change over the last year. Our study indicates that neurological symptoms were more prevalent among participants with an older age. The aging of the nervous system and muscles can result in in evitable structural and functional deterioration that asso ciated with the dec line of the cogni tive and motor function [38,39]. An older age also indicates worsened health a nd a reduced capability to recover from not only neurological disorders but also a wide range of preconditions that lead to neurological symptoms, for instance stroke [40]. Moreover, despite the biological change s associated with aging, age accompanied psychological and behavioral change shoul d also be taking into account in explaining the higher prevalence of neurolog ical symptoms among the oldest-ol d. Aging accompanied stress, for instance, is shown to have dele terious neurological effects on th e health of olde r adults [41]. We estimated the prevalence of neurological symp toms systematically while prior studies often examine limited symptoms, such as weakness, dizziness, fall, seizur e, and fainting [3,5,15-18]. However, the variations in st udy design and sample require cau tion in making comparisons and drawing valid conclusions. For instance, in our study, the prevalence of falls was 14.8% while the prevalence ranged from 137 to 690 falls per 1000 pers ons per year in previous studies [42-44]. The prevalence of numbness and tingli ng in our study participants was 19.0% and 5.3%. In contrast, a prior research suggested that the prevalence of numbness and tingling or pain was 28.2 % and 26.8% among individuals with diabetes, respectively, compared with15.7% an d 22.8% among individuals without diabetes [45]. In sum, our study provided an overall estimate of the prevalence neurological symptoms among community-dwe lling Chinese older adults. Dizziness is the most common neurological symptom in our study reported by 31.0% of Chinese older participants. A prior population-based study among older adults identified the prevalence of dizziness ranged from 27% to 34% r [46]. Previous studies also recognized the multifactorial nature of dizziness and falls as geriatric syndromes resulted from the impairment of one or multiple systems ranged from mild to seve re [47,47]. Given that the dizziness and falls are commonly experiences among U.S older adults, our study points to the need of applying multifactorial strategies to incorporate all the poten tial contributing factors into consideration in 45 AIMS Medical Science V olume 2, Issue 1, 35-50. healthcare practice, including sensor y balance, blood pressures, intake medications, gait impairment, depression and anxiety, etc [47]. This holistic appr oach to assess geriatric syndrome was proved to be effective in reducing falls, the third most pr evalent symptom identified in our study among U.S Chinese older adults [48]. Our study observed that compared with men, U.S older females were more likely to report neurological symptoms. Our finding was supported by previous research indicating that older females are 1.3 to 2.2 times more likely to fall and 2.03 times more likely to experience dizziness [5,46]. Moreover, females with neurological disorders may be prone to certain neurological symptoms [49-51]. For instance, although men are believed to have a higher prevalence of Parkinson's disease, a recent study suggested women with Parkinson's disease are more likely to report tremor [52]. As an increasing number of the studies documented the gender differences on the aging effect on human brain and other neurologi cal system mechanism [ 53], our study provides important insight onto th e gender disparity on the e xplicit presence of neur ological symptoms among U.S Chinese older adults. Our research suggests that U.S. Chinese older a dults with lower educati on and income level are more likely to experience neurol ogical symptoms. Although it is not well-documented on the variation of neurological symptoms by education or income, it is suggested that the education and income may influence many behavioral risk factors which can contribute to the normal function of the neurological system in the aging process. Bett er-educated older adults are more likely to engage in cognitively stimulating activities, have better economic circumstan ces, eat healthier, spend more time to participate in physical ac tivities, less stresse d, and less likely to expose to environmental hazards [54-56]. Consequently, it is noted that lowered educated are of higher risk to diseases such as dementia, stroke and heart dis eases, mental health di sorders [57-60], all of which could increase their vulnerability to a number of neurological symptoms. Our intriguing finding also indica tes that older adults are more likely to report neurological symptoms if they live in the community for fewer years. The experiences of immigrating to the U.S may have life-changing influences on the health and well-being of older adults . Chinese older adults residing in U.S may encounter many language and cultural barriers of ad justing their lives in the U.S. Living in the community for a shorter period of time may indicate inefficient social support in the resettled environment, higher risk of exposure to daily life stressors, less experiences in acculturating to westernized lifestyle, and lack of access to co mmunity and healthcare resources. All of those factors can contribute to the higher prevalence of neurological symptoms. However, years of living in the community may interact with other factors, su ch as age, income level, and educational level. Future analysis is need ed utilizing mixed methodol ogy to identify risk factor s of the prev alence of neurological symptoms. Our study reveals that U.S Chinese older adults perceive themselves with poorer health status, poorer quality of life, and worsened health change over last year if they have neurological symptoms. Prior study estimated that dizziness, the most pr evalent symptom in our study, was associated with greater disability measures [61], and have detrim ental influence on all quali ty of life dimensions among older adults [11]. Falls and other sensory symptoms are among the most important indicators for quality of life among persons with Parkinson's disease [13]. Our findings m ay indicate a series of psychophysical changes along with th e presence of symptoms: experi encing neurological symptoms may negatively influence the psychological well-bei ng of the older adults; the psychological burden can reversely add on the likelihood of neurologica l symptoms. For instance, prior study indicates 46 AIMS Medical Science V olume 2, Issue 1, 35-50. falls, even the fear of falling can greatly contribute to the lowered quality of life [ 12,62]. In any case, our finding highlights that experiencing neurological symptoms in fluence the universal health outcomes of the U.S Chinese older adults. The findings of this study have limitations. First, the generalizability of the findings to other Chinese populations is uncertain si nce our study was only representati ve of Chinese older adults in the Greater Chicago area. Future studies are needed to explore th e risk factors and impact of neurological symptoms in diverse Chinese populations. In addition, recall bias might exist since we asked participants to self report their experience of neurological symptoms in the past year. The prevalence of neurological symptoms could likely to be underreported. Mo reover, our measure of neurological symptoms was base d on subjective self-re ported data and not verified by medical history records so that we were not able to attribute those symp toms to a certain disorder. The cross-sectional design is limited in assessing the de velopment process of neur ological symptoms and limited in establishing causal rela tionships. Furthermore, the data we collected are unable to assess the severity or frequency of symptoms as well as those who experience multiple symptoms. Future studies applying mixed research st rategies and longitudinal design are needed to better understand the neurological risks and the adverse h ealth outcomes among Chinese older adults. Nonetheless, this study has wide implications for researchers and practice. First, this study calls for collaborative efforts of an inter-disciplinary rese arch team to investigat e neurological symptoms and syndromes, linking the presence of those symp toms to clinical dia gnose. The multifactorial nature of the neurological symptoms requires clinic al healthcare practitioners to gain an overall estimate on the underlying mechanism of onset ne urological symptom be fore developing the treatment plan. Second, while many ol der adults in commun ity generally perceive those symptoms as part of the normal aging process, it is important to raise community awareness that the presence of neurological symptoms can be early signs of neurological diso rders and other health risks. Healthcare professionals need to proactively inquiry the presence of neurological symptoms within the high risk subgroups of Chines e older adults, including the olde st-old, women, less-educated, and low income, whereas patients also need to activel y seek for professional medical care and report neurological symptoms to their physicians. In light of the traditional tabooed cultural belief of talking about having those symptoms will link to potent ial of developing diseases, culturally sensitive interventions and educations are needed to alleviat e stress and anxiety associated with self-reporting neurological symptoms. Third, considering the negative impact of the ne urological symptoms on Chinese older adults' lives, culturally and linguistically appropriate h ealth education programs should be developed to promote healthy lifestyle and prevent risk factors in Chinese older adults. Also, workshops and other health communication opportunities should be provided to older adults with neurological symptoms to train them with necessary coping skills in a holistic perspective. For instance, older adults need to learn about fall prevention, as well as how to cope with the fear of falling and the physical injuries after they fell. Fourth, the caregive rs of older adults with neurological symptoms need also be trained to perform proper support to deal with those symptoms. On the pol icy level, our finding advocates for an integrated diseases management healthcare system to foster better communication between clinical practitioners and patients with neurologic al symptoms, and to offer additional social support for several subgroups of older adults who are at higher risk of suffer ing from neurological symptoms. 47 AIMS Medical Science V olume 2, Issue 1, 35-50. 5. Conclusion In sum, this study indicates that neurologi cal symptoms are comm on among Chinese older adults in the U.S, and dizziness is the most common symptom. Our findings call for further investigations on several subgroups of Chinese older adults who reported higher prevalence of symptoms, including the oldest-old, lower educated, and low income. Future longitudinal studies are needed to improve our understanding of the outc omes and functional mechanism underlying the neurological symptoms among Chinese aging populations.
