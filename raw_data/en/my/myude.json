However, the use of guidelines, checklists, and training can decrease the risk of anesthesia-related adverse events. These tools should be used not only during the time thepatient is unconscious but also before and after this phase. The framework for safe anesthesia delivered as a continuum ofcare from home to hospital and back to home is presented in these guidelines. The critical importance of client commu-nication and staff training have been highlighted. The role of perioperative analgesia, anxiolytics, and proper handling offractious/fearful/aggressive patients as components of anesthetic safety are stressed. Anesthesia equipment selectionand care is detailed. The objective of these guidelines is to make the anesthesia period as safe as possible for dogs andcats while providing a practical framework for delivering anesthesia care. To meet this goal, tables, algorithms, gures, and \"tip\"boxes with critical information are included in the manuscript and an in-depth online resource center is available at aaha.org/anesthesia.

AAFP (American Association of Feline Practitioners); ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologists); BP (blood pressure); CRI sat- urated with oxygen) \u00aa2020 by American Animal Hospital Association JAAHA.ORG 1Introduction The statement \"there are no safe anesthetic agents, there are no safe anesthetic procedures, there are only safe anesthetists \"should be the dictum for the entire anesthetic process in every practice.1The anesthesia team has the crucial role of identifying patient comor- bidities and procedure risks and minimizing the detrimental effectsof perioperative pain and stress in order to provide safe and ef - cacious anesthesia for each patient. In addition, \"anesthesia \"is not limited to the period when the patient is unconscious but is acontinuum of care that begins before the patient leaves home andends when the patient is returned home with appropriate physio-logic function and absent or minimal pain levels. At home, thecontinuum begins with the pet owner administering prophylacticdrugs like analgesics and anxiolytics as well as fasting the pet. In thehospital, the anesthesia continuum includes all of induction, maintenance, andrecovery. Anesthesia starts with a preanesthetic evaluation and sta-bilization (if necessary) of the patient, preparation of all of theanesthetic equipment, and selection of appropriate drugs withprecise calculation of drug dosages for all phases of anesthesia. In-duction and careful intubation followed by intraoperative moni-toring and physiologic support in the maintenance phase are thenext steps, with continued monitoring and support into the re-covery phase. Postanesthesia care, as communicated by the veteri-nary staff with the pet owner in the clinic and at home, completesthe continuum. Provision of analgesia and client/staff communica-tion and education are critical throughout the entire process. The objective of these guidelines is to make the anesthesia period as safe as possible for dogs and cats while providing a practicalframework for delivering anesthesia care before, during, and after theanesthetic procedure. The guidelines are intended to be compre-hensive but neither all-inclusive nor a single source for informationand clinical recommendations. More detailed references are availablefor pain management 2and cat-speci c anesthetic and disease-, breed-, and procedure-speci c anesthesia recommendations and outcomes. However, the guidelines are designed to be as actionable as pos-sible. With that in mind, readers will nd the guidelines 'visualcomponents to be particularly useful. Algorithms, gures, \"tips\" boxes, and tables provide quick access to the essential resources andmethods associated with anesthesia. An online resources center(aaha.org/anesthesia) is also available for more detailed information. Phase 1: Preanesthesia Individualized Anesthetic/Analgesic Plan and Client Communication An individualized anesthetic plan with speci c and sequential steps ensures the continuum of care throughout the entire anesthetic process. A complete anesthetic plan must address all phases of an-esthesia, with inclusion of perioperative analgesia throughout eachphase. Although each patient should be treated as an individual,having a set of anesthesia plans that are used repeatedly is appro-priate. This allows the anesthesia team a level of comfort with theiranesthesia protocols while adjusting plans based on individual pa-tient needs. The preanesthesia phase includes not only the choice of preanesthetic sedatives and analgesics but also a full preanestheticevaluation and stabilization of the patient, if necessary. Categori-zation of patients using the American Society of Anesthesiologists(ASA) Patient Status Scale (scoring of 1 -5) provides a framework for evaluation of patient health and determination of stabilizationrequirements prior to anesthesia (available at aaha.org/anesthesia).An increase in ASA status from 1 or 2 to 3, or from 3 to 4 or 5,increased the odds of anesthesia-related death in dogs and cats. 4 In another study, an ASA status of $3 increased the odds of anesthesia-related death when compared with an ASA statusof#2, with cats having a higher odds ratio than dogs for anes- thetic death. 4,5 Risks speci c to the patient 's size and age and the surgical or medical procedure need to be considered.4-6Disease-related risks should be corrected or minimized if possible (see textbox \"Potential Anesthesia Risk Factors and Actions to Mitigate Risk \").6-8 Monitoring of physiologic parameters and provision of physi- ologic support are integral to the plan in order to reduce the like-lihood of adverse events. 4-6Also critical is a plan for anesthetic recovery and for postdischarge care.4-6Resources such as staf ng, Recommended Resources Related Resources 2015 AAHA/AAFP Pain Management Guidelines for Dogs and Cats (aaha.org/pain- management-guidelines)2015 AAHA Canine and Feline Behavior Management AAFP Feline Anesthesia Guidelines (catvets.com/guidelines/practice- guidelines/anesthesia-guidelines)2019 AAHA Dental Care Guidelines for Dogs and Cats (aaha.org/dentistry) 2013 AAHA/AAFP Fluid Therapy Guidelines for Dogs and Cats (aaha.org/fluid-therapy- guidelines)2019 AAHA Canine (aaha.org/caninelifestage) and 2010 Feline Guidelines 2 JAAHA | 56:2 Mar/Apr 2020equipment, and drug availability should be considered throughout the entire anesthetic plan. To further minimize patient risk, use of an anesthesia-surgery checklist (available at aaha.org/anesthesia) helps prevent practicesfrom committing critical oversights and errors in the peri- andintraoperative periods. These patient safety checklists can be createdfor every sedation or general anesthesia procedure, as part of thepatient 's medical record. Step 1: Preanesthetic Evaluation and Plan Considerations Preanesthetic EvaluationThe preanesthetic patient evaluation is critical for patient safety as itpromotes identi cation of individual risk factors and underlying physiologic changes or pathologic compromise that will impact theanesthetic plan. Factors to be evaluated include the following: \u00b7History: Identify risk factors such as known medical conditions and previous adverse drug responses. Clarify the use of all prescribed and over-the-counter medications (e.g., aspirin,herbal products, cannabidiol, and supplements) to avoid ad- verse drug interactions. 9Note any abnormal clinical signs, both acute and chronic, with individual questions speci cally di- rected at the cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, ner- vous, and musculoskeletal/mobility systems. Records should beevaluated for previous anesthetic events, and client communi-cation should include speci c questions regarding satisfaction with previous anesthetics and recoveries. A smooth recoverymay be noted in the hospital, but the patient may go home andexhibit abnormal behaviors such as lethargy, nausea, vomiting,restlessness, and vocalization, which could indicate pain orother complications that need to be addressed. \u00b7Physical examination: A thorough physical examination should be completed and documented within 12 -24 hr previous to anesthesia and repeated just prior to anesthesia if acute clinicalchanges occur. Failure to record a physical exam was reportedto increase the odds for death in dogs. 4 \u00b7Age: Although age is not a disease, disease processes occur more commonly in aged patients, and physiologic systemscan be immature in neonatal and pediatric patients. Advancedor very young age can increase anesthetic risk because of al-tered responses to drugs caused by changes or immaturity incardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, and neurological sys-tems. 4-6Examples include the inability to mount a robust phys- iologic response to hypotension or hypothermia in theseage groups. Neonatal and pediatric patients may also be im-pacted by hypoglycemia and geriatrics by impaired cognitivefunction. A fairly high percentage of health abnormalities,including those that might cause a cancellation of or change inanesthesia, have been identi ed during preanesthetic screening of \"sensitivities \"have been identi ed. Greyhounds may have prolonged recoveries after receiving some anesthetics such as barbiturates and mayexperience hyperkalemia associated with general anesthesia. 11,12 Breeds affected by multiple drug resistance mutation 1(now ABCB1 or adenosine triphosphate binding cassette sub-family B member 1) gene mutation should receive reduceddosages of acepromazine and potentially butorphanol. 13Con- versely, breed-speci c anatomy or propensity for underlying conditions commonly impact anesthesia. For instance, brachy-cephalic dogs and cats are more prone to upper airway obstruc-tion, and brachycephalic breeds have been nonbrachycephalic dogs (e.g., Cavalier King Charles spaniel) and cats (e.g., Maine Coon)may be predisposed to cardiac disease. 15Other breed-related diseases that may impact anesthesia, such as collapsing tracheain many small-breed dogs, breed-related renal or hepatic dys-function, low intra-erythrocyte potassium concentrations in the Shiba Inu, and drug metabolism in cats, should also be considered. 16Breed-related size can also impact anesthesia.6 Very small/toy-breed dogs and all cats are at increased riskfor anesthetic complications because they are more prone tohypothermia and may be more dif cult to intubate and mon- itor. These patients may experience volume overload if a meansto deliver precise fluid volume (e.g., syringe pumps, buretrols, etc.) is not instituted and are more easily overdosed if high-concentration drugs, high-volume syringes, or high-volumebags of fluid are used. Giant-breed dogs can be at increased risk because they are more commonly overdosed when milli-gram per kilogram dosing versus body surface area dosingis used. \u00b7Temperament: Fear, anxiety, and stress can be exhibited in many ways, including aggression, hiding, fleeing, or freez- ing. When any of these behaviors are exhibited, the patientmay bene t from medication administered at home to pro- vide anxiolysis and reduce fear prior to travel to the hospi-tal. An aggressive temperament can limit the preanestheticevaluation or make examination prior to sedation impossi-ble. This can impair the ability to detect abnormalities andmay increase anesthetic risk. Anxious patients often requirehigh doses of sedatives or tranquilizers, which may causerespiratory and cardiovascular depression. For elective pro-cedures, consider rescheduling with a plan to manage anx-iety before admission to the clinic. Conversely, a quiet or2020 Anesthesia and Monitoring Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 3depressed animal may require drug dosages for seda- tion or anesthesia. \u00b7Patient Diagnostics: Risk factors and speci c patient concerns provide a framework for developing individualized anesthesiaplans and may indicate the need for additional diagnostic test-ing, stabilization before anesthesia, or adjustments in chronicmedications (see textbox \"Recommendations for ChronicMedications the Day of Anesthesia \"). Individual patient diag- nostics may include a minimum database of laboratory analysis(complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinalysis) andcould include other components such as blood pressure(BP), electrocardiogram (ECG ), and imaging modalities like echocardiogram or ultrasound. For example, BP should beroutinely measured in patients with renal, cardiovascular,and endocrine disorders. Curr ently, dogs eating a grain- free diet should undergo an echocardiogram to evaluatecardiac contractility as a resul t of link between dilated cardiomyopathy and grain-free diets. 17There is no evidence to indicate the min imum timeframe between lab- oratory analysis and anesthesia. A reasonable timeframeis#3-6 mo if values were normal and the patient is clini- cally healthy. If either lab values or the patient 'sh e a l t hi s abnormal, repeat diagnostics should be performed immedi- ately prior to anesthesia. Other Plan Considerations \u00b7Type of Procedure: In addition to patient temperament and comorbidities, consider the level of procedural invasiveness, du-ration of surgery, and anticipated pain level.

ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme. 4 JAAHA | 56:2 Mar/Apr 2020with airway control is required for long, invasive, and/or poten- tially painful procedures (dentistry, elective ovariohysterectomyor castration, or orthopedic procedure) and for any patient withairway compromise or undergoing airway surgery. Sedation maybe appropriate for shorter ( ,30 min) and less invasive proce- dures (e.g., diagnostic procedures, joint injections, suture re-moval, and minor wound management) in healthy patients.However, heavy sedation is not suitable for all patients andmay actually increase the odds for anesthesia-related death. 5 For instance, in older, medically compromised patients, briefgeneral anesthesia is preferable because it is less stressful andmore controlled than sedation. Some procedures may limit phys-ical access to the patient (e.g., oral or ophthalmic procedures),necessitating individualized plans for monitoring, catheter ac-cess, etc. \u00b7Clinical Staff Training: Trained clinical staff are essential for safe anesthesia. The number of trained staff and the level at whichthey are trained will also impact ef ciency and scheduling. In addition, staff training can positively impact speci c areas of anesthesia; for instance, staff training in local and regional an-esthesia techniques will help facilitate their perioperative use. \u00b7Time of Day: Increased anesthetic risk has been documented for procedures occurring late in the day or after normalhours. 4,6This is because of a combination of inadequate time for stabilization, limited staff availability, and staff fatigue. Thefact that many procedures are also emergency or urgent, versusscheduled or elective, is also associated with an increase in therisk of anesthetic death. 5,6Nonemergency procedures may be best performed during the next available regular clinic daywhen time for preparation and planning is adequate. Whenpossible, critical patients should be anesthetized early in theday to allow adequate time for anesthetist-supported recovery. Step 2: Client Communication/Education Once the initial plan is formulated, pertinent information regarding the anesthetic procedure and pet-speci c risk factors should be discussed with the pet owner. Because of safety concerns, pet ownersare sometimes hesitant to authorize discretionary procedures re-quiring general anesthesia, such as preventive dental care or diag-nostic imaging. This concern is best alleviated with appropriatecommunication between the veterinary team and the pet owner,along with education of the pet owner regarding the entire anestheticprocess. Additional resources are available at aaha.org/anesthesia. Communication with the pet owners should include a full description of the anesthetic procedure and a discussion of potentialrisks prior to obtaining written, preprocedural consent. In healthydogs and cats, the risks of anesthetic-related death were estimated tobe 0.05% (1 in 1,849, dence interval (1 in 895, 95% CI 0.09- 0.14%) in cats, with death most frequently occurring in the rst 3 hr postoperative. 6,18Al- though this can be concerning, fears can be alleviated with as-surance that the anesthesia team will consider multiple factorsincluding health status, breed, age, expected pain level, and sur-gical plan when making an individualized anesthesia plan for theirpet. Tailoring each patient 's anesthetic plan to their speci cn e e d s allows the anesthesia team to provide optimum care, includingpatient-speci c anesthetic monitoring performed by a dedicated anesthetist. The anesthesia team should clearly communicate tothe pet owner that these measures will decrease the likelihoodof anesthetic complications both during the procedure and in therecovery period. Pain management and patient comfort is generally very con- cerning to the pet owner and should be emphasized as an integralpart of each patient 's anesthetic plan. Pet owners should be reassured that multiple modalities will be used to minimize patient discomfortand stress level prior to leaving home, in hospital, and during re- covery at home. The pet may require analgesics and anxiolytics administered at home, and the bene ts of these drugs should be explained. The overarching goal for client communication is toensure that the pet owner is con dent that the anesthesia team has the compassion, skills, and technology to provide the safest possibleanesthesia for their pet. Phase 2: Day of Anesthesia Step 1: Anesthesia Begins at Home The pet owner begins the continuum of anesthesia with fasting the petand administering medications as directed by the anesthesia team.Although not all evidence is in agreement, in general, the recommendedfast duration for healthy adult patients has decreased. The change isbased on clinical experience and experimental evidence of shorterfasting bene ts, including a lower incidence of gastroesophageal refl ux (GER). An abbreviated fast is particularly important for diabetic andneonatal patients ( Figure 1 ). Most medications currently adminis- tered to the pet should be continued on the day of anesthesia, butthere are exceptions, especially for some cardiac medications (seetextbox \"Recommendations for Chronic Medications the Day of Anesthesia \"). Analgesic drugs (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) may be among the drugs that the patient is al-ready receiving or may be started immediately prior to the procedure.If the patient experiences motion sickness, maropitant should beconsidered for administration before the patient is transported to thehospital to prevent vomiting. Anxiolytic drugs should de nitely be administered for all fractious/aggressive/fearful patients and should bestrongly considered for patients that develop any level of fear, anxiety,2020 Anesthesia and Monitoring Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 5or stress during a visit to the veterinary hospital. Gabapentin and trazodone are commonly used for this purpose. Dosages for theseand other previsit pharmaceuticals are listed in Figure 2 . Step 2: Equipment Preparation Prior to the start of any general anesthesia or sedation-only pro-cedure, it is critical to ensure that all equipment and monitors areturned on, are functioning, and have undergone appropriate safetychecks. All necessary equipment, including the anesthesia machine,breathing circuit, endotracheal tube (ETT), intubation tools (e.g.,laryngoscope), and anesthetic monitors, should be prepared. An-esthetic equipment is considered \"life-critical \"because the well- being of patients can be adversely affected if the equipment is notfunctioning optimally or is used incorrectly. Anesthesia machines,paired with breathing circuits (nonrebreathing circuit [NRC] orrebreathing circuit [RC]), are designed to deliver oxygen (O 2) and inhalant anesthetic to the patient and to prevent rebreathing ofcarbon dioxide (CO 2) by the patient. The machine and the breathing circuit become part of the patient 's respiratory system and can support, if working correctly, or impair, if working incorrectly,respiratory function. Two essential safety features to have on everyanesthetic machine are (1) an in-circuit manometer and (2) a safetypop-off valve (see examples at aaha.org/anesthesia). A manometerallows safe delivery of manual and mechanical breaths, enables leakchecking of the seal of the ETT cuff within the trachea, and allowsfor a visual indication of rise in airway pressure. Safety pop-offvalves prevent excessively high airway pressure and potential baro-trauma. These can be installed on most anesthesia machines for usewith both types of breathing circuits. Anesthesia personnel have a responsibility to understand the proper use and function of, and be able to set up, check, and trou-bleshoot, all necessary equipment prior to use. Equipment setupshould be guided by checklists (found at aaha.org/anesthesia) thatdictate general equipment preparation tasks for the day (e.g., ll theFIGURE 1 Feeding and treatment recommendations for dogs and cats prior to anesthesia. 6 JAAHA | 56:2 Mar/Apr 2020CO 2absorbent c preparation tasks for each pa- tient (e.g., pressure check the anesthesia machine prior to each use). Step 2a Ensure that O 2levels in the E-tank or hospital supply tank are .200 psi or that the oxygen generator is functioning properly. Fill thevaporizer with liquid inhalant. If the patient will be breathingthrough an RC, change the CO 2absorbent after 8 hr of use, whichmay be roughly daily or weekly, depending on the anesthesia caseload. Step 2b Connect the breathing circuit to the machine. When choosing abreathing circuit, note that NRCs are commonly used for cats andsmall dogs (patients ,3-5 kg [6.6 -11 lbs]) because, compared with RCs, they cause less resistance to breathing and have low equipmentFIGURE 2 Anxiolytic, sedation, mg/kg IM\u00a7dead space, both of which are important considerations in small patients. Excessive equipment dead space leads to rebreathing of CO 2 and subsequent hypercarbia/hypercapnia. Dead space should be keptto a minimum and should be #2-3 mL/kg, which is #20% of total tidal volume. The patient end of breathing circuits (where mixing ofinspired and expired gases occurs) is a common source of dead space.Pediatric circuits, which have low dead space, are recommended foruse in smaller patients. Rebreathing of CO 2in the NRC is prevented by high O 2flow rates, which also allows for a faster turnover in the change of anesthetic depth when adjusting the vaporizer setting. Thus,the O 2flow should be w200-400 mL/kg/min when using NRCs.19 Flow adequacy should be monitored with a capnograph and adjustedto keep the inspired CO 2to,5 mm Hg. If any occlusion occurs in the expiratory limb of the circuit, the relatively high oxygen flow rates used in NRCs will cause rapid pressurization of the entire system andcan lead to airway damage and/or circulatory collapse within minutes.In addition, the oxygen flush valve should never be used in a patient breathing through an NRC because it directs a high-pressure flow directly into the patient 's airway, potentiating barotrauma. The risk of high airway pressure damage is increased in cats and small dogs be-cause of their small lung capacity ( w400 mL per average cat). For safety, a high-pressure alarm can be inserted in the expiratory limb ofthe breathing circuit. This does not allow escape of gas but emits aloud noise if the pressure in the circuit rises. An example of this alarmcan be found at aaha.org/anesthesia. Rebreathing circuits (i.e., circle systems) with lightweight plastic rebreathing hoses and minimal dead space are typically used inpatients .3-5 kg (6.6 -11 lbs). Pediatric RCs typically have lower equipment dead space compared with hoses for adult patients andcan be used for patients ,3-5 kg (6.6 -11 lbs) if NRCs are not available. RCs depend on functional one-way valves to ensure uni-directional gas flow and on CO 2absorbent to prevent rebreathing of CO 2. Proper valve function can be assessed by breathing through the circuit while visualizing movement of the correct valve on inspira-tion and on expiration. During the maintenance phase, total O 2flow rate should typically be 20 -40 mL/kg/min, with a minimum 500 mL/min to ensure accurate vaporizer output. The bene ts of lower flow rates include decreased environmental contamination and de- creased consumption of O 2and volatile anesthetic gases (i.e., inhalant anesthetic not inhaled by the patient). Lower flow rates also conserve moisture and heat. When using RCs, a minor disadvantage of lowerflow rates is increased time to change anesthetic depth after changing the vaporizer setting. Step 2c Leak test the machine and circuit be fore anesthetizing each patient and after changing any breathing circuit components. This safetymeasure ensures that oxygen is flowing to the patient and that there is minimal risk of inhalant leakage. For this step, the adjustablepressure limiting, also called the pop-off valve, must be closed.Occlude the end of the breathing circuit and increase the O 2flow to raise the machine circuit pressure to 20 -30 cm H 20 on the ma- nometer. The oxygen should be turned off, and the pressure ma-n o m e t e rs h o u l dr e m a i ns t e a d y .I fn ol e a ki sd e t e c t e d ,o p e nt h epop-off valve, and then release the breathing circuit occlusion. Ifa leak is detected, pull the machine from use and initiate trou-bleshooting procedures. Step 2d Ensure proper setup of the scavenging system to limit or eliminatepersonnel exposure to inhalant g ases. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration provide s advisory guidelines, although some US states have speci c regulations regarding control of waste anesthetic gases. Active scavenging systems are far more effectivethan passive scavenging systems (e.g., activated charcoal canis-ters). More information on waste anesthetic gas is available through the American College of Veterinary Anesthesia and Analgesia. 20 Step 2ePrepare for airway management by choosing ETTs of appropriatesizes and intubation tools (e.g., stylets, laryngoscope), along witha face mask for preoxygenation prior to induction. Veterinarianshave several options for intubat ion, including clear cuffed yvinylchloride, silicone, and self-sealing baf fled tubes. Supra- glottic airway devices, which do not require intubation, areavailable for airway management in cats and rabbits. See aaha.org/anesthesia for advantages and disadvantages of the various Anesthesia Equipment Safety Tips \u00b7To improve anesthesia safety, include a manometer and a safety pop-off valve in the patient breathing circuit. Thelatter prevents a rapid increase in airway pressure due toa closed pop-off valve, thus decreasing the risk of baro-trauma. \u00b7Following the oxygen flow from the anesthesia source, through the anesthesia machine and breathing circuit, tothe patient, then from the patient to the rebreathing bag(or reservoir bag on NRC) and nally to the scavenging system, is an effective way of learning the common com-ponents of the anesthesia machine and breathing circuit. 8 JAAHA | 56:2 Mar/Apr 2020devices. ETT elbow and capnograph adapters are a source of dead space. To decrease dead space breathing without increasingairway resistance, the diameter of the capnograph and elbowadapters should always exceed the internal diameter of the ETT. Asingle elbow adapter may add up to 8 mL of dead space, whichcan be excessive in small patient s. Low dead space adapters are recommended. Step 3: Patient Preparation The patient should be stabilized before anesthesia as anesthesia andsurgery can exacerbate pre-existing physiologic compromise. Stabili-zation is patient-speci c and includes acute (e.g., immediate preop- erative IV fluid administration and analgesia) and chronic (e.g., initiation of treatment for cardiac disease, with anesthesia rescheduledafter 2 -4 wk of therapy) stabilization. An accurate patient weight should be obtained on the day of anesthesia. All drug doses should be based on the patient 's lean bodyweight, as fat bodyweight contributes little to volume of dis-tribution and hence should add little to the anesthesia dose. Prep- aration of an anesthesia record and patient-speci c emergency drug calculations are important steps in preparing for potential anesthetic complications. In almost all situations, placement of an IV catheteris optimal anesthetic patient care as the catheter allows for admin-istration of additional anesthetics, analgesic drugs, and fluids, along with administration of emergency medication drugs, if needed.Patients undergoing very short procedures do not necessarily re-quire fluids yet still bene t from an IV catheter. Step 4: Anesthesia Protocol Step 4a. Pain ManagementEffective analgesia throughout the entire anesthesia continuum is anintegral component of patient health and welfare. Analgesia hasnumerous advantages as a component of general anesthesia. 21First, analgesia improves anesthetic safety by decreasing the dose of in-halant drugs required for anesthesia maintenance, thus decreasingthe likelihood dose-dependent optimizes patient outcome with fewer pain-related adverseeffects such as tachycardia, hypertension, slowed gastrointestinalmotility, delayed wound healing, upregulation of pain, changes inbehavior, etc. 23,24Third, although not yet proved in animals, pro- vision of perioperative analgesia may decrease the development ofacute pain-related chronic pain. 25 Pain is a complex multidimensional sensation with multiple sources. Using one drug or drug class for treatment of pain is unlikelyto provide adequate pain relief, at least in moderate to severe painstates. Using multiple drugs and modalities, each with activity atdifferent sites of the pain pathway, all eviates or eliminates pain at multiple sites and from multiple sources. An example is the combination of an anti-infl ammatory drug that decreases nociceptor activity and a local anesthetic that blocks pain signal tr ansmission, plus an opioid or alpha-2 agonist to decrease receptor response in the central nervous system. Thisconcept, known as multimodal or balanced analgesia, provides greaterpain relief and promotes anesthetic safety by further anesthetic drug dosages. 23The use of multimodal anal- gesia also decreases the impact of d rug unavailability, as with the recent opioid shortage. In addition, a balanced protocol includespreemptive, or preventive, analgesia and analgesia for a durationappropriate for the type/degree of pain. Preemptive administra-tion of analgesic drugs decreases intra- and postoperative anal-gesic requirements. 23Although not thoroughly researched in animals, the appropriate duration of analgesic therapy in animalscan be extrapolated from the duration needed to control pain inhumans suffering similar pain insults. Extrapolation is appro-priate because of the similarities of the mammalian pain pathwayacross species. 26Because animals conceal pain, treatment duration should be based on scienti c knowledge of pain duration and not on presence/absence of pain signs. Building an Analgesic Protocol: This is an overview of peri- operative analgesia. For more in-depth information, see the AAHA/ American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP) Pain Manage-ment Guidelines and World Small Animal Veterinary Association Analgesia Guidelines . 2,27Analgesic drugs can be distributed into the four phases of anesthesia (preanesthesia, induction, maintenance,and recovery). Opioids are often the rst class considered when designing protocols. Although this strategy is ef cient for anesthetic plan development, when considering the sources of pain and themechanisms of action of analgesic drugs, building an analgesic protocol is more effective if centered on anti-in flammatory and local anesthetic drugs. In flammation is generally a major compo- nent of acute pain. Because in flammation is also the pathology that produces most acute pain syndromes, control of in flammation decreases further tissue damage and speeds healing. An anti-inflammatory drug (traditional NSAID or grapiprant) should be administered to all appropriate patients. Local anesthetic drugs block sodium channels and provide complete pain relief from the nerves that are blocked. This fact led tothe recommendation \".local anesthetics should be utilized, insofar as possible, with every surgical procedure. \" 2The task force recom- mends the use of local anesthesia, including the simple techniquesfor common procedures in Figures 3 -5. Although opioids do not block pain at its source or stop the transmission of pain, they are potent and rapidly acting, makingthem excellent for acute pain relief. Full mu-opioid receptor agonists2020 Anesthesia and Monitoring Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 9(morphine, for example) are the most potent analgesics but also the most impacted by regulatory control. Buprenorphine is moderatelypotent but has a longer duration (4 -6 hr) than most full mu-opioid agonists, with the FDA-approved buprenorphine for cats providing24 hr of analgesia. Butorphanol is only mildly to moderately po-tent and has a short duration of action ( ,6 0m i ni nt h ed o ga n d 90 min in the cat). 27SeeFigure 6 for opioid selection consider- ations. A f t e ra na n t i - i n flammatory drug, a local block, and an opioid have been chosen, adjunctive drugs should be added. Dexme-detomidine and medetomidine provide both sedation and anal-gesia, and their analgesic effects a re synergistic with those of theopioids, thus enhancing the effects of the less potent opioids. 28 Ketamine, administered as a subanesthetic dose infusion in amultimodal protocol, prevents or decreases the development ofcentral sensitization, a condition that signi cantly ampli es pain intensity. 27 A d j u n c t i v ed r u g sw i t hl e s sp r o o fo fe f cacy include mar- opitant and gabapentin.

Cats: Continue in ltrating as the needle exits the testicular body to block the skin and subcutaneous tissue. b. Dogs: Inject local anesthetic in skin and subcutaneous tissue at the incision site. *Although bupivacaine or ropivacaine provide a longer duration than lidocaine, some clinicians are more comfortable with lidocaine because it has a higher safety margin if accidentally injected IV and the testicles are highly vascular. Thus, personal comfort with the drugs dictates nal drug choice for this block. yOn removal, the testicle may appear hemorrhagic. Artwork by Lauren anesthetic pr otocol. Gabapentin is used for treatment of chronic neuropathic pain but is unlikely to provide analgesia for acute infl ammatory pain. However, gabapentin might be appropriate in patients with pre-existing neuropathicpain if dosed at a minimum of 10 mg/kg q8h r . 31,32Tramadol appears to provide minimal acute pain relief in dogs.33Although it is perhaps more ef cacious in cats, especially used multi- modally, cats are particularly averse to the drug 'st a s t e .34,35Tra- madol is controlled and linked to human diversion, so dispensingfor home use should be limited.

Close the incision as usual, leaving the local anesthetic in the abdomen. *Lavaging the abdomen right after the incision may be more effective (preemptive analgesia) but the local anesthetic could potentially be absorbed by sponges used to blot blood. The goal is to leave the drug in the abdomen. Thus, lavage just prior to closure may be more ef cient. Artwork by Lauren D. Sawchyn, DVM, CMI. Multimodal Analgesic Drug Considerations analgesic drugs, preanesthetic sedativesand anxiolytics are an important component the continuum ofanesthesia care. Bene ts include decreased stress/anxiety and dose reduction of induction and maintenance drugs, which have dose-dependent adverse effects. Reduced patient stress can reduce riskof harm to staff members who are restraining/handling patients. Asstated, providing appropriate oral medication at home can alleviateanxiety and pain prior to the pet 's admission to the hospital. 36,37In- hospital, preanesthetic medications can be administered by the in-tramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous route to achieve effects well inadvance of anesthesia induction, or intravenously just prior to an-esthesia acute dose-sparing effects of induction drugs. Speci c drugs/drug combinations should be chosen based on desired effects(e.g., reversible sedation) and individual patient needs (e.g., degreeof analgesia; Figure 2). After premedication, physiologic monitoringand support (more information in the maintenance section) areconducted as indicated by the patient 's health status. Early support of body temperature should be initiated in all patients. Thermalsupplementation is critical as hypothermia can cause numerousadverse events (more information in the Troubleshooting AnestheticComplications section). Premedicant drugs listed in Figure 2 are also useful for sedation alone, remembering from previous information that greater patientsafety is often achieved with general anesthesia, even for short Premedication Tips \u00b7Nonmedication strategies such as low-stress handling, pheromones, and environmental considerations (suchas cat-only wards) play an important role in reducingpatient fear and anxiety in the preanesthetic period. \u00b7Fractious/fearful patients should be managed with appro-priate preanesthetic anxiolytics and sedatives, generally athigher dosages than those required by calmer patients, toallow IV catheterization (if possible) and induction whileensuring staff safety.2020 Anesthesia and Monitoring Guidelines or feline sacrococcygeal or for relaxation for delivery of puppies/kittens, and other surgeries of the penis or perineal region.

A crucial point is that sedated patients, just as those undergeneral anesthesia, require appropriate monitoring and supportivecare. Administer supplemental oxygen to the deeply sedated patientusing a facemask. The patient may require airway prepared to intubate if necessary.Step 4c. Anesthetic InductionPreoxygenation should be considered part of the preanesthetic/induction sequence. Delivery of 100% oxygen for only 3 minprovides almost 6 min of adequate saturation of hemoglobin withoxygen. 38This is especially critical in patients with airway disease (e.g., pneumonia, asthma) and breathing dif culty (e.g., upperFIGURE 7 IV induction protocols for dogs and cats.2020 Anesthesia and Monitoring Guidelines 15airway from and in patients with expected dif cult intubation (e.g., upper airway collapse or airway foreign body). All pregnantpatients should be preoxygenated to ensure adequate fetal oxy-gen delivery. Ap a t i e n t 's sedation level following preanesthetic drugs will in- fluence the dose of induction drug, which should always be dosed \"to effect. \"Typically, appropriate premedication will result in lower doses of induction drugs. In addition, sick, de bilitated, or depressed patients may require lower doses than healthy, alert patients. Anesthetic in-duction is most effectively and ef ciently achieved by administra- tion of fast-acting drugs (dosages and speci cp r o t o c o l si n Figure 7 ),such as propofol, alfaxalone, etomidate, diazepam- or midazolam-ketamine, airwaycontrol. IM administration ( Figure 8 ) of a combination of a sedative and either ketamine or tiletamine-zolazepam combined in the samesyringe can be used to both premedicate and induce patients whosevenous access is limited by size (i.e., cats and very small dogs) ortemperament (i.e., fractious or aggressive). This does not allowrapid control of the airway, and patients should be observed closelyas they are becoming unconscious. Supplemental oxygen adminis-tration during this period should be considered in manageable(i.e., not fractious or aggressive) patients. A patent airway should be secured using placement of an ETT or supraglottic device as soon after induction as possible. TrachealFIGURE 8 Intramuscular (IM) sedation/induction combination protocols for healthy dogs and cats. 16 JAAHA | 56:2 Mar/Apr 2020intubation is an essential part of m aintaining an open and protected airway. The length of the tube should be assessed prior to intubation. The proper length will allow the proximal end of the tube to be at orjust external to the incisors and the distal tip of the tube to lie midwaybetween the larynx and the thoracic inlet. The largest-diameter ETTthat will easily t through the arytenoid cartilages without trauma should be used. This will minimize resistance and the work ofbreathing. Correct placement can be con rmed by direct visuali- zation of the tube between the arytenoids, movement of therebreathing bag, condensation in the ETT during exhalation, and/orobservation of a de nitive end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO 2) tracing. A properly in flated cuff on a conventional ETT is necessary to create a seal for adequate positive pressure ventilation (PPV) and avoidinhalant leakage, being aware that overin flation may cause tracheal damage. 39Applying a light coating of sterile lubricating jelly improves the cuff 's ability to seal the airway.40Once the patient is intubated and connected to a breathing circuit, ensure that O 2isflowing, close the pop-off valve or push down the button on the safety pop-off valve,and administer a manual breath to 15 -20 cm H 20 while listening at the patient 's mouth for a slight hissing sound, audible if the cuff is under-de flated. If detected, slowly in flate the cuff while simulta- neously administering a manual breath. Once the sound has dis-appeared, immediately open the pop-off valve or release the buttonon the safety pop-off valve and secure the ETT to the patient 'sh e a d . Self-sealing baf fled ETTs may be more leak resistant, but they do not allow air to escape around them if the airway pressure is excessive.When changing the patient 's position after intubation, disconnect the ETT from the breathing tube so that the ETT does not rotate withinthe trachea as tube rotation may cause tracheal tears, especially if thecuff is relatively overin flated. Tracheal tears are a signi cant issue in anesthetized intubated cats. 39,41 Final considerations: Padding and appropriate positioning (es- pecially for cachectic, geriatric, or large patients) should be provided.Apply corneal lubricant postinduction to protect the eyes from cornealulceration after induction and every 2 -4h r . Step Anesthetic MaintenanceAnesthesia is O 2and dosed \"to effect. \"19,38Maintenance can also be achieved using continuous infusions or intermittent doses ofinjectable agents, or a combination of injectable and inhalantdrugs. Short-duration maintenance can be achieved with IM ad-ministration of sedatives plus ketamine or tiletamine/zolazepam. IMalfaxalone can be effective for short-duration, deep sedation in catsand small dogs, but the high dose required for anesthesia mainte-nance in healthy cats can cause excitement and hypermetria in re-covery. 42 \u00b7Physiologic Monitoring: Regardless of the drugs used for anesthesia maintenance (i.e., inhalant or injectable), vigilant monitoring, interpretation of physiologic changes, and re- sponse to patient physiologic status by well-trained and atten-tive staff are critical. Monitoring decreases the odds ofanesthetic death, 18whereas lack of monitoring increases the odds of anesthetic death by a factor of 5 -35.5Both FIGURE 9 Drugs to support blood pressure in the anesthetized patient.Induction and Intubation Tips \u00b7Mask or chamber inductions can cause stress, delayedairway control, and environmental contamination andare not recommended by the authors. \u00b7Intubation tip: The capnograph adapter can be placed onthe end of the ETT to con rm proper endotracheal tube placement during intubation. \u00b7Cats can be particularly dif cult to in the2018 Guidelines.32020 Monitoring Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 17multiparameter electronic monitors and hands-on assessment of the patient by the anesthetist should be used. Treatmentdecisions should be made based on information from boththe electronic monitors and the anesthetist 's assessment. Moni- toring respiratory function includes respiratory rate, oxygenation(percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen [SpO 2]), and ventilation (ETCO 2). BP , heart rate (HR) and rhythm (ECG), capillary re ll time, mucous membrane color, and pulse oximetry (SpO 2) provide the best indices of cardiovascular function. Anes- thetic depth is monitored, and a surgical plane of anesthesia istypically de ned as a patient with absent palpebral refl ex, mild jaw tone (i.e., muscle relaxation), and lack of purposeful movement.Body temperature monitoring is critical, with heat supplementa-tion starting early; see section on anesthetic complications. \u00b7Physiologic Support: Regardless of the drugs used for anesthe- sia maintenance (i.e., inhalant or injectable), O 2should be delivered to the patient. The O 2flow rates depend on the breathing circuit (see section on equipment preparation). Foran RC, use a relatively high flow rate (2 -3 L/min) when rapid changes in anesthetic depth are needed, such as during thetransition from injectables to inhalants (induction) or whendiscontinuing inhalants at the end of the procedure. Becauseof the high oxygen flow, increased flow at induction and after discontinuing inhalants is not necessary when using an NRC.Increased inspired CO 2suggests an inadequate O 2flow rate. Following induction and intubation, the patient may be apneic or have a low or shallow respiratory rate, requiring intermittent (1-4 breaths/min) PPV breaths delivered by the anesthetist to maintain anesthesia until the respiratory depression of theinduction drugs subsides. If PPV is excessive, ETCO 2levels will decrease below the level that stimulates ventilation and thepatient may not begin spontaneously breathing. Balanced crys-talloid fluids should be administered for most patients under- going anesthesia. The basal fluid rate for healthy dogs and cats is 5 mL/kg/hr and 3 mL/kg/hr, respectively. Additional volumeshould be added to the basal rate for correction of hypovole-mia, including dehydration, and replacement of ongoing fluid losses. Fluid volume should increase or decrease depending onthe patient 's health status and fluid needs. See the 2013 AAHA/ AAFP Fluid Therapy Guidelines for Dogs and Cats for more information. 43 \u00b7Troubleshooting Anesthetic Complications: Immediate and ef- fective response to complications is critical. Themost common complications are hypotension, hypoventilation,hypoxemia, hypothermia, and some arrhythmias like sinus tachy-cardia and bradycardia. Complications in the cardiovascular andrespiratory systems are generally the most acutely life-threatening.More detailed information for cats is available with the 2018 AAFP Feline Anesthesia Guidelines and online at aaha.org/anesthesia. 3 oCardiovascular System Complications: -Hypotension is a common complication during anesthesia and is de ned as BP values of systolic ,80-90 mm Hg, mean ,60-70 mm Hg, and diastolic ,40 mm Hg.44Evaluation of other physiologic parameters (capillary re ll time, peripheral pulse pal- pation) can be used to aid in the diagnosis of inadequate blood flow. Balanced anesthetic techniques such as additional opioid or a local block may permit a further decrease in inhalant dose, thus improving BP . Complete avoidance of the inhalant anesthetic-mediated dose-dependent vasodilatation can be achieved by ap-plication of partial or total intravenous anesthesia techniques(Figures 7 and 8). An IV crystalloid (5 -20 mL/kg, depending on patient needs) and/or colloid (1 -5 mL/kg) bolus can be ad- ministered IV. If the patient is also bradycardic, administer ananticholinergic (atropine, glycopyrrolate) or sympathomimetic(e.g., ephedrine). If decreased cardiac contractility or excessivevasodilation are causing hypotension, administer a positive ino-trope or vasoconstrictor, respectively ( Figure 9). If hypotension continues, ensure that the patient is not hypoglycemic, hypother-mic, or anemic/hypoproteinemic and that there is no electrolyteimbalance. Initiate BP support and corrective therapy if theseabnormalities are present. -Arrhythmias commonly occurring perioperatively include sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, atrioventricular block, andventricular arrhythmias. Monitor using auscultation or ECG and/or by observing pulse -HR incongruity with Doppler ultrasound or SpO 2waveform. The decision of whether to treat an arrhyth- mia should be based on the severity, the effect on other hemody-namic parameters (e.g., BP), and the likelihood of deteriorationto a more signi cant arrhythmia. Examples of common arrhyth- mias and treatment considerations seen during anesthesia can befound aaha.org/anesthesia. -Tachycardia ,H R.180 bpm in cats3and HR .150- 190 bpm for large and small dogs, respectively,44during anesthesia deserves special mention, because it should prompt the anesthetistto run through a list of rule-outs and not simply assume it is aresponse to inadequate anesthetic depth. Tachycardia can be sec-ondary to a noxious stimulus, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and hypo-volemia. It can also occur secondary to administration of drugssuch as alfaxalone, ketamine, atropine, and dopamine. -Hypertension ,d ened as a mean arterial pressure .120- 140 mm Hg or a systolic arterial pressure .160-180mm Hg,44is uncommon in the adequately anesthetized patient, even in pa-tients with primary hypertension, because of the negative cardio-vascular effects of inhalant anesthetics. Again, rule out a response Mar/Apr 2020to noxious a light plane of anesthesia. The BP cuff should also be exam-ined to ensure it has not slipped distally (e.g., around the carpus).BP can be veri ed with a second technique such as Doppler. Analgesics such as additional opioid should be provided to thepatient who is consistently hypertensive. If hypertension persistsbut the patient appears to be adequately anesthetized and receiv-ing appropriate analgesia, the increased BP may be tolerated.Increasing the vaporizer concentration in an attempt to decreaseBP is not advised. oRespiratory System Complications -Hypoventilation can be estimated by observing respiratory rate and depth (very subjective) and can be quanti ed using capn- ometry. Hypoventilation can hypoventilation should ETCO 2isw35-45 mm Hg in awake patients and w40- 50 (up to 55) mm Hg in patients in an appropriate surgical plane ofanesthesia. To correct increasing CO 2,r s te n s u r et h a tt h ec a u s ei s not excessive anesthetic depth by checking the vaporizer setting andevaluating indicators of the patient 's anesthetic plane. Initiate PPV if ETCO 2is.60 mm Hg (hypercapnia). The anesthetist can deliver breaths by manually squeezing the r eservoir bag while occluding the adjustable pressure limiting valve, taking great care to not leave thevalve closed except when delivering a breath. A safety pop-off reliefvalve will prevent this complication. A mechanical ventilator can beused if the anesthetist is knowledg eable and comfortable with venti- lator use. Visit aaha.org/anesthes ia for more information on mechan- ical ventilation. Prior to instituting PPV, the hemodynamic status ofthe patient should be stable, if possible, as PPV can negatively affectcardiac output through impaired venous return. Recheck BP afterstarting PPV. If BP declines, decrease peak airway pressure and con-sider a fluid bolus (5 -20 mL/kg) if there is t he potential that the patient is hypovolemic. PPV can also cause barotrauma, so ventilatorsettings should start conservati v e l ya n db ea d j u s t e db a s e do nE T C O 2. If hypercapnia persists, investigate causes of increased inspired CO 2 including excessive dead space, exhausted CO 2absorbent or one-way valves not functioning properly in an RC, or inadequate oxygen flow in an NRC. If machine malfunction is suspected, it may be prudentto quickly replace the machine with a different machine. -Hypoxemia (SpO 2,95%, severe SpO 2,90%) is uncom- mon when a patient is intubated and breathing 100% oxygen.44 Observation of mucous membrane color is not a sensitive indi-cator of hypoxemia as cyanosis will likely not occur until hypox-emia is profound. 45Continuous assessment of oxygenation is best accomplished with pulse oximetry. With low SpO 2, the anesthetist may be tempted to troubleshoot the pulse oximeter by reposition-ing the probe, moistening the mucous membranes, or trying adifferent monitor. These measures may work if the issue is indeedthe probe, but prior to troubleshooting the probe, verify that thepatient is properly intubated and connected to the oxygen sourceand that the supply of oxygen is adequate. Hypoventilation cancause hypoxemia, so adequate ventilation should be ensured, aspreviously described. Insertion of the ETT past the thoracic inletcan cause one-lung intubation with decreased pulmonary surfacearea for gas exchange. If one-lung intubation is likely, the ETT canbe pulled out slightly, with the goal to move the tip of the ETTinto the trachea. Hypoxemia can be secondary to atelectasis, inpatients with abdominal distention or obesity positioned in dorsalrecumbency, or to primary pulmonary (e.g., pneumonia) or pleu-ral (e.g., pleural effusion) disease. If this is expected, manual ormechanical ventilation should be instituted and a positive-endexpiratory pressure (PEEP) valve (2.5 -5c mH 2O) can be added to the expiratory limb of the circuit to open collapsed airways.Decreased oxygen delivery to the tissues from perfusion issues(rather than respiratory issues) can also cause decreased SpO 2 readings. Treat indicators of poor perfusion such as slow capillaryrell time, brady- or tachycardia, hypotension, and weak pulses (see section on cardiovascular complications). If no improvement occurs with these treatments, the patient should be positioned in sternal recumbency as soon as possible and recovered from anes-thesia with continued oxygen support. oOther Complications -Hypothermia , core body temperature ,988F, can result in a myriad of adverse effects, including delayed drug metabolism,cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired perfusion, respiratory com-promise, cerebral depression, increased incidence of wound infec-tion, etc., and is a very unpleasant sensation in conscious patients(as described by humans). 44Delayed drug metabolism and cere- bral depression can result in prolonged recovery.46The most ef- fective heating methods are circulating warm-water blankets andwarm air circulation systems. Other methods of supplementalheat that may be helpful in slowing heat loss include warm IVfluids, use of a fluid line warmer, and insulation on the patient 's feet (bubble wrap, baby socks, etc.). Do not use supplemental heatsources that are not designed speci cally for anesthetized patients as they can cause severe thermal injury. 47Because shivering sig- nicantly increases oxygen consumption, continue to provide supplemental oxygen to shivering patients, especially those withrespiratory or cardiovascular compromise. -GER and regurgitation can cause esophagitis and aspiration pneumonia and can lead to esophageal stricture in extreme cases.When noted, suction of the esophagus is recommended followedby lavage with saline or tap water, with concurrent endotrachealtube protection of the airway. Diluted bicarbonate can be instilled2020 Anesthesia and Monitoring Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 19into the esophagus to increase pH.48Maropitant prevents vomit- ing, promotes more rapid return to normal feeding, and improves the quality of recovery from anesthesia but appears to have a lessereffect on the incidence of re flux or regurgitation. 49Metoclopra- mide, ranitidine, and omeprazole plus impact on regurgitation. 50,51GER and regurgita- tion was minimized combined withomeprazole 1 mg/kg. 52However, as GER and regurgitation cannot be consistently prevented, the use of gastroprotectants, such as omepra-zole 1 mg/kg at least twice (evening prior and morning of anesthe-sia), can be considered for the neutralization GER pH in at-riskpatients. 50 Step 4e. Recovery from Anesthesia Although many complications occur throughout anesthesia, be-tween 47 and 60% of all anesthetic-related dog and cat deaths,respectively, occur during the post operative period of anesthesia, with most occurring within the rst 3 hr. 4-6Thus, patient care and monitoring of the recovering patient by trained personnel iscritical and should be maintained with the same vigilance asduring the maintenance phase of anesthesia. The anesthetistshould continue monitoring speci c patient physiologic param- e t e r ss u c ha sH R / R R( r e s p i r a t o r yr a t e ) ,S p O 2,B P ,a n db o d y temperature. Patients should be closely observed until they arealert, normothermic, and ambulatory (unless nonambulatorypreoperatively). An optimal recovery time (within 10 -30 min of the end of anesthesia) for dogs and cats will depend on thepatient health status, type of anesthetic technique used (i.e.,inhalant versus injectable), duration of anesthesia, and bodytemperature. In case sedatives, analgesics, or emergency resuscitative drugs are needed, intravenous catheters should be left in place until thepatient is extubated and in sternal recumbency with physiologicparameters returned to normal. Extubate when the patient 's RR and SpO 2are within normal limits and the patient can adequately protect its airway by vigorously swallowing. De flate the cuff im- mediately before removing the ETT. With patients who have un-dergone a dental procedure or rhinoscopy, it is bene cial to position the nose slightly lower than the back of the head and leave the ETTcuff slightly in flated during extubation. This will help clear blood clots and debris from the trachea and deposit any fluid or debris into the pharyngeal region where it can drain from the mouth or beswallowed, thereby reducing the risk of aspiration. Respiratory de-pression, potentially with resultant hypercapnia and hypoxemia,often persists during early recovery from anesthesia. Severe hyper-capnia can lead to cerebral impairment and potentially to respira-tory arrest. The capnograph adapter can remain on the end of theETT to assess ventilation until the patient is extubated. 53In addi- tion, a pulse oximeter should be used throughout recovery to assessthe degree of oxygen saturation. Numerous factors can impact the quality of recovery and should be addressed to aid the patient 's smooth emergence from anesthesia. Environmental stress, bright lights, excessive noise, and a cold en-vironment can attribute to the patient 's discomfort following an- esthesia. Bladder distension can be very uncomfortable. Express thebladder to minimize any discomfort, especially for those patientswho may be nonambulatory and unable to urinate on their own inthe immediate postoperative period. Delayed recovery, dysphoria, and emergence delirium are common complications in the postoperative period. Delayedrecovery can be caused by excessive anesthetic depth duringthe maintenance phase. This can not only prolong the recoveryphase but also negatively impact the respiratory, cardiovascular,and thermoregulatory systems. Hypothermia (body temperature,988F[ 3 6 . 7 8C]) can lead to multiple physiologic complications, including delayed drug metabolism, further prolonging the pa- tient'sr e c o v e r y . 46Patient warming devices should be used throughout the recovery phase.46,53Certain drugs can cause pe- ripheral vasoconstriction (e.g., alpha-2 agonists) or vasodilation (e.g., inhalants), modifying the heat loss from the patient and influencing the effectiveness of external warming devices.46,47 Hypoglycemia, especially in small or neonatal patients, can lead to a prolonged recovery, so monitor blood glucose frequently.Judiciously titrated drug antagonism may be considered if thepatient 's recovery is concerningly prolonged. Alpha-2 agonists should be reversed only if the patient is excessively sedate orrapid recovery is needed. Opioid effects should be antagonizedonly if other analgesics have been administered; otherwise, thepatient could experience intolerable pain. Dysphoric recoveries and emergence delirium can often be dif- cult to differentiate. Emergence delirium often presents as an un- controlled, uncoordinated thrashing of the patient, often encounteredwhen the patient has regained partial consciousness quickly after thediscontinuation from maintenance anesthetic drugs. Dysphoric re-coveries can result from many issues, including uncontrolled pain, andhypoxemia due to airway obstruction. Administer an analgesic if pain issuspected. If pain management is adequate, administer an anxiolyticsedative, such as dexmedetomidine (which also provides analgesia),generally 0.001 -0.005 mg/kg IV or IM (up to 0.01 mg/kg). If re- spiratory complications are the cause of the dysphoria/delirium,provide supplemental oxygen and assess the respiratory functiono ft h ep a t i e n t .I ns o m ec a s e s ,t h ep a t i e n tw i l ln e e ds m a l ld o s e so falfaxalone 1 -2 mg/kg or propofol 1 -2 mg/kg IV administered slowly until calm. Be prepared to reintubate if necessary. 20 JAAHA | 56:2 Mar/Apr 2020Final considerations: Provide ade quate padding for nonambulatory patients. Reapply eye ointment every 2 -4 hr during the recovery period until an adequate blink re ex is present. Phase 3: Return Home Once the patient has been discharged, the anesthesia continuum comes full circle. Pet owners can bene t from receiving anesthetic discharge instructions, in addition to a surgical discharge form. Thisguides postoperative care by the pet owner and alleviates theirconcerns, addressing possible complications that could be encoun-tered and outlining when the veterinary team should be contacted. Anesthesia-related drugs for discharge generally include anal- gesics, primarily NSAIDs for most patients, and may include anxi-olytics and maropitant. Antibiotics are a component of surgical careand outside the scope of this document. Because opioids are DEAcontrolled and subject to diversion, they should be provided onlyto patients predicted to otherwise experience substantial pain andonly after careful study of the DEA, FDA, and individual stateguidelines. Links to regulatory information and opioid alternativesare available through the International Veterinary Academy of PainManagement. 54 Special Focus: Staff Education and Safety Training Staff training is critical for anesthetic safety. Although this is actually therst step in anesthesia, this section has been placed separately in order to emphasize its importance.Providing quality patient care through scienti c and knowledge- based practice is the mission of veterinary medicine. A cornerstoneof the implementation and success of this objective is the veteri-nary staff, from the veterinarians, technicians, and assistants to thereceptionist/of ce personnel. Creating a cohesive team and providing the educational training resources for the staff is key to patient andpersonnel safety. Untrained staff can lead to unhappy, unproductiveemployees who are inef cient and could compromise patient care with procedural mistakes. This can lead to a decline in customerservice, ultimately leading to a decrease in practice revenue as a resultof the loss of clients. A successful training program begins with the active participation o ft h ee m p l o y e e .T a k i n gt h et i m et oi n t r o d u c es t a f ft oh o s p i t a lp o l i c i e sand procedures will result in a more ef cient work flow. Training can be performed by all members of the team in various capacitie s; for example, an experienced nurse can teach clinical skills, the veterinarian can teachscience, and the patient care represe ntative or receptionist can help with effective client communication. This allows for all practice teammembers to become engaged in the s uccess of individual employees. First, create a plan for training by determining the practice goals. Be specic in those expectations. A comprehensive staff training program is outlined at aaha.org/anesthesia, organized into weekly training sessionsover a 12 wk period. Assign each department into an individual trainingobjective, an approach that minimizes the ambiguity of trying to \"learn everything. \"List the tasks you need each employee to learn weekly and monthly as well as the resources available to support these skills.Regularly test your new employees to ensure retention of material. Usethe full spectrum of educational resources, including handouts, in-house presentations, checklists, and online courses. Anesthesia-based training programs should start with the anes- thesia machine. Employees should not attempt to use anestheticequipment before being properly trained and quali ed to troubleshoot problems. 55Checklists for daily anesthesia machine function, case preparation, and preventive maintenance should be readily availableto the employee. A reliable way to prevent equipment failure is toinspect each part of the machine daily and before use. 56Once a technician has been trained how to set up, operate, and disassemblePostoperative Pain Assessment Regardless of the perceived efcacy of the analgesic protocol, as- sessment of the patient's pain level during recovery from anesthesiais imperative as adequate pain relief is unlikely to be achieved in allpatients. Using pain scoring systems, although not perfect, increasesthe likelihood that pain will be recognized and treated appropriately.Pain scoring resources are available online. Example of Information Included in an Anesthesia Discharge Form Pets may experience some sedation for the rst 12-24 hr following hospital discharge but should be easily awakened and able to performnormal functions. Pets may have a decreased appetite for 12-24 hrfollowing anesthesia. This time frame may be longer dependent onthe type of surgical procedure performed. Pets may experience aslight cough for 1-2 days from mild irritation from the breathing tubeused during anesthesia.Call the veterinary team if: -Your pet 's appetite or activity level does not return to normal within 24 hr -Your pet 's cough is moist, progressive, or productive -Your pet experiences any concerning changes in behav- ior or mentation.2020 Anesthesia and Monitoring Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 21the anesthesia machine, the primary focus should center on the proper use of breathing circuits, rebreathing bags, and appropriateendotracheal tube selection. AAHA.org/anesthesia provides an anes-thesia machine readiness checklist. A properly working anesthesiamachine is critical to not only patient safety but also operator safety.Exposure to volatile anesthetic agents, including nitrous oxide andhalogenated gases, is hazardous. Although the full risks associatedwith anesthesia exposure are unknown, exposure should be mini-mized. Retrospective studies have indicated, although speci ci n c i - dence is unknown, that exposure to these hazardous chemicals canresult in headaches, nausea, early pregnancy loss, and reduced spermcount in humans. 57A properly sealed (i.e., not leaking) machine and ETT cuff, avoidance of mask and chamber inductions, and the properuse of the scavenging systems will limit exposure to anesthesia gases. Once an employee is comfortable operating the anesthesia machine, training should shift to include anesthetic monitoring.Most patient complications will rst be detected through use of an anesthetic monitor. For that reason, the anesthetist should becomfortable interpreting patient parameters such as ECG, ETCO 2, BP, SpO 2, and body temperature. Anesthesia is pharmacologically based. Thus, speci c training should be conducted on the various drug classes, along with a \"what to expect \"guideline. Emphasis can be placed on the medications used for sedation, pain management, and general anesthesia (see thesections on Anesthesia Protocol). All clinical personnel should be trained in emergency resuscitation, with a review session repeated every 6 -12 mo. The new Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) initiative uses acombination of online and hands-on training. 58Studies show that cardiopulmonary resuscitation outcomes are affected, not only by theavailability of emergency carts, drugs, and equipment but also by thelevel of training within the hospital. The recognition of an emergentsituation is almost as critical as the response itself. Summary Anesthesia, which is an integral part of daily care in veterinaryhospitals, cannot be de ned merely by the time that the patient is unconscious, but rather by a continuum of care that begins at homewith the owner and does not end until the patient returns home to theowner for follow-up care. Anesthesia is a multidimensional proce-dure involving not only the patient 's individual characteristics but also speci c and critical equipment, appropriate drugs and drug dosages, diligent physiologic monitoring and support, thoroughclient communication, and highly trained staff. Using this infor-mation, a template for standardized procedures structured in asystematic, stepwise approach is described in the guidelines. This isanalogous to the growing emphasis on checklists as error-preventionand organizing tools in human medicine. Standardized methodsthat use medical-speci c checklists have been shown to improve the quality and consistency of healthcare delivery in a variety of clinicalsettings. 59There is an inherent risk of morbidity or mortality as- sociated with anesthesia, but by following the continuum of anes-thesia as described in the guidelines, the risk for anestheticcomplications is greatly minimized. In fact, patient health can po-tentially be improved by increased oxygen delivery via support ofboth cardiovascular and respiratory systems and by alleviation orelimination of pain. Some details from these guidelines that warrant special mention are equipment selection/maintenance, pain management, stafftraining, and client education. Anesthesia is equipment intensive,more so than many other medical disciplines. The best staff trainingand anesthesia protocols will be nulli ed if a faulty breathing circuit or malfunctioning valve causes anesthetic complications. Thus,regular equipment maintenance and staff pro ciency in its operation are not afterthoughts, but essential, rst-line aspects of anesthesia care, as presented here. Pain management, which is highlighted in these guidelines, is integral to optimal anesthesia and recovery from surgical procedures.The patient 's level of postprocedural discomfort should be evaluated by both the veterinary team and, with guidance from the team, itsowner. Proactive use of pain management protocols will enhancethe quality of care, patient healing, and owner satisfaction. Communication with and education of the pet owner are important and necessary aspects of the anesthetic process. Allmembers of the practice team should assume responsibility forconducting an informed dialog with clients about the risks ofanesthesia and the commitment of the anesthesia team to de-creasing those risks. Staff education equips the practice team toboth decrease anesthetic risks and properly educate pet ownersabout general anesthesia. No aspect of veterinary practice is moredependent on staff education than anesthesia, and detailed anes-thesia training protocols are a feature of the guidelines. Trainingsessions should preferably be accompanied by periodic re-fresher training and a best-practices approach. If done regularlyand purposefully, staff education also creates a continuous im-provement culture within the practice and fosters a teamworkenvironment. The objective of these guidelines was to make the anesthesia period as safe as possible for dogs and cats while providing a practicalframework for delivering anesthesia care before, during, and after theanesthetic procedure. We are con dent that using the guidelines, along with supplemental information from suggested references andthe online resource center at aaha.org/anesthesia, will allow theanesthetist to meet that objective. 22 JAAHA | 56:2 Mar/Apr 2020The authors gratefully acknowledge the Mark Edward W.
