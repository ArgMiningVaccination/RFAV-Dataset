Apple Cider Vinegar Apple cider vinegar or ACV, as it is commonly called, is a vinegar made from apples. It is one of the best treatments to cure food poisoning due to its alkaline effect. The alkaline effect reduces the acidity in your stomach and hence, helps in relieving symptoms of food poisoning. Mix 2-3 teaspoons of ACV in a cup of hot water. Consume the prepared drink before eating your meal. If the problem persists, consume 2-3 teaspoons of undiluted ACV for better results. 2. Ginger (Adrakh) Ginger plays an important role in reducing the symptoms of food poisoning. Due to its natural anti inflammatory properties, ginger will soothe your stomach lining. It is recommended to boil a cup of water with about one spoon of grated ginger in it. Add honey or sugar according to taste. Alternatively, you can consume pieces of ginger directly. 3. Yogurt And Fenugreek Seeds (Dahi and Methi) An effective and convenient method to cure food poisoning. Yogurt has antibacterial (bacteria-killing) properties that help fight the bacteria causing food poisoning. Plus, fenugreek seeds have a high content of soluble fiber which absorbs water and adds bulkiness to the stools which helps the food to move along. This lubricating property of fenugreek seeds helps to treat abdominal discomfort. Consume approximately one teaspoon each of yogurt and fenugreek seeds. It is advised to just swallow the seeds and not chew them. 4. Lemon Lemon is considered the \"king of remedies\" as far as food poisoning is concerned.

Mix about one teaspoon of lemon juice with sugar and consume directly. You can dilute it with lukewarm water. 5. Bananas Bananas are a good remedy to cure food poisoning as they are very light and easy to digest.
