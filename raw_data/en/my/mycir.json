Clinical trial data at hospitals around the world revealed that the antiviral drug, remdesivir, cut the duration of symptoms shown in patients with Covid-19 from 15 days to 11 - a 31pc improvement in recovery time. Experts said that the drug, previously tested to treat Ebola and manufactured by US biotech Gilead, could help alleviate pressure on healthcare providers and allow some softening of lockdown restrictions. \"Put down the bleach, remdesivir is coming,\" Cory Kasimov, a biotech analyst at JPMorgan, said following the announcement. The data, which is yet to be published in full, has fuelled hopes that a treatment for coronavirus could be on the horizon, with one analyst calling it a \"game-changer\". \"If the numbers hold up to scrutiny, this could be a real breakthrough for the fight against the disease that killed more than 200,000 people worldwide in just a few months,\" said Philipp Rosenbaum, an infectious diseases analyst at GlobalData. But within hours of the US government's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci heaping praise on the drug, a separate trial in China published in the Lancet medical journal showed disappointing results. The trial found that Gilead's experimental drug did not speed up recovery from Covid-19 compared with a placebo in critically ill patients, but the report's authors warned the data was limited as it was forced to stop the trial early. Adam Barker, a healthcare analyst at Shore Capital, said uncertainty surrounding the drug's efficacy is further evidence of the need for pharmaceutical firms and health organisations to [develop more than one treatment](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-vaccine-latest-news-trial-covid-19/) to fight coronavirus. \"Although we would not be surprised to see the drug approved by the US Food & Drug Administration, we don't believe the data is 'game changing' and so the search for new therapies (and particularly vaccines) must continue,\" he said. \"Given the pace of development and the number of small trials ongoing, we expect further confusing data to arise on candidate therapeutics.\" AstraZeneca became the latest pharma player to throw its support behind the creation of an immunisation on Thursday in an agreement to manufacture and distribute [a vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/30/covid-19-vaccine-effectiveness-could-known-less-six-weeks-says/). The group said it intends to build capacity to produce tens of millions of doses by the end of the year if a vaccine is successful. The global hunt for a vaccine has seen a number of cross-country and company collaborations, including between GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi, two of the world's largest vaccine manufacturers. GSK chief executive Emma Walmsley has warned of the need for more than one vaccine as firms battle with a tight timeframe to produce treatments that will need to be available for billions of people. \"It is not just when will a vaccine be ready; it is when will it be ready at scale,\" she said. \"The world definitely needs more than one vaccine and there are several different approaches - it is not just from small companies or from big ones but it is on new technologies or proven ones.\" Mr Rosenbaum said the sheer scale of the task at hand meant Gilead, which only in January had enough of its experimental drug to treat 5,000 people, was likely to find it difficult to meet demand. \"How many patients will benefit from Gilead's drug is unclear,\" he said. \"With the company already struggling to meet the high demand, the question of distribution, given that remdesivir is administered intravenously, and uncertainties about drug pricing is being voiced.\" But despite its potentially limited ability to treat patients at scale, experts believe Gilead's drug could still play a vital role in the fight against coronavirus. \"The bottom line is the drug improves patients and clearly appears to help,\" said Michael Yee, an analyst at Jefferies. \"It's not a magic silver bullet but it does improve patients and likely will get broader uptake.\" Sir Mene Pangalos, vice-president of biopharmaceuticals and R&D at AstraZeneca, said a wide variety of treatments will play a role in overcoming the pandemic. \"Some people don't like being vaccinated and some people won't have a good immune response to a vaccine, so having multiple ways of treatment this illness is going to be important like you have with many illnesses,\" he said. \"The scale of what we need to do here is massive and no one has ever done it before. Any one company is going to struggle to supply this to the world which is why institutions are pulling together. This is going be a coordinated effort from many "}
