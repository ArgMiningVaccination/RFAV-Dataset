In Romania, the authorities issued a strategy for activities regarding vaccination against COVID-19, including the informed consent procedure. The lack of legal preparedness was evident when the medical personnel at the vaccination centers were provided with informed consent forms that did not respect the existing legal requirements. In addition, the protocol for persons seeking vaccination stated that the patient was supposed to receive the informed consent form from the receptionist in order to read and sign it. We analyzed the legal implications and the malpractice litigation risk associated with this practice. Due to essential deficiencies and in the absence of an official enactment of new regulations, we conclude that the vaccination consent process did not comply with the legal requirements. Implications include medical personnel's legal liability, loss of malpractice insurance coverage, and public mistrust that may have contributed to a low vaccination rate. Given the potential of future pandemics or other health crises, this may be a valuable lesson for developing better legal strategies.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-11-05", "cleaned_text": "Informed Consent in Mass Vaccination against COVID-19 in Romania: Implications of Bad Management [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10111871](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10111871) [Safety Concerns, Sources of Liability, Compensation Strategies and the Right to Be Informed: Ethical and Legal Issues of COVID-19 Vaccination]( /journal/vaccines/special_issues/Safety_Source_Compensation_Right_Ethical_Legal_COVID-19_Vaccination )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-vaccines-10-01871)], and individuals, with some exceptions [ [2](#B2-vaccines-10-01871), [3](#B3-vaccines-10-01871), [4](#B4-vaccines-10-01871)], could choose whether to be vaccinated. [5](#B5-vaccines-10-01871), [6](#B6-vaccines-10-01871)], but, at the same time, vaccination programs had to be implemented in a way that respected patients' decisional autonomy [ [7](#B7-vaccines-10-01871)]. Previous studies reported strategies for improving vaccination rates without compromising patients' right to consent. It was noted that choice architecture and compensations could increase vaccination acceptance [ [8](#B8-vaccines-10-01871)], as well as good communication of the herd immunity concept [ [9](#B9-vaccines-10-01871)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-10-01871)]. Pandemics unprecedentedly challenge the traditional informed consent approach, with direct opportunities for the patient to express questions. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic generated several legal issues, including the possibility of a derogatory regime for obtaining patients' informed permission [ [11](#B11-vaccines-10-01871)]. In some countries, the patients were not asked to sign an informed consent to be vaccinated [ [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01871)]. [13](#B13-vaccines-10-01871)]. [14](#B14-vaccines-10-01871)]. Romanian law clearly states what type of information physicians must provide to patients. In addition, the law requires the use of a unique informed consent form. Without any derogatory regime for informed consent regarding the vaccination against COVID-19, the medical personnel at the vaccination centers had to comply with the general legal provisions regarding the informed consent process. [15](#B15-vaccines-10-01871)]. These forms were published on the abovementioned national platform. Two versions of this document are available, one for adults and one for minors. 2. Romanian Legal Framework Regarding Patient's Informed Consent 2.1. How Informed the Informed Consent Should Be? [Table 1](#vaccines-10-01871-t001). [16](#B16-vaccines-10-01871)]. At the same time, Italy opted for full disclosure [ [17](#B17-vaccines-10-01871)] and provided patients with an appendix of data on the vaccine, risks included [ [18](#B18-vaccines-10-01871)]. The United Kingdom determined that cover letters should be issued to individuals who were able to consent and contain information about risks and website links. Patients ultimately received individualized vaccine information and signed a consent form [ [19](#B19-vaccines-10-01871)]. [20](#B20-vaccines-10-01871)]. Obtaining a patient's informed consent is not simply a routine checking of a legal form [ [21](#B21-vaccines-10-01871), [22](#B22-vaccines-10-01871)] but a process through which individual values and freedom are expressed. Consent is essential to the therapeutic relationship of trust between the physician and the patient, and the informed patient has the freedom to select and refuse therapy [ [23](#B23-vaccines-10-01871)]. Romanian jurisprudence acknowledges the importance of a thorough explanation of the medical act and its risks and consequences: \"the law requires the doctor to inform the patient about his health status, but this information requires not only a reading of the test result but also an interpretation of this result from the doctor's perspective\" [ [24](#B24-vaccines-10-01871)]. [Table 2](#vaccines-10-01871-t002). 2.2. Informed Consent\u2014A Signature on a Legal Document [25](#B25-vaccines-10-01871)]. The lawmaker issued this unique informed consent form for use in Romanian medical practice, per the Health Ministry's Order no 1411/2016 ( [Appendix A](#app1-vaccines-10-01871)). 3. Assessing Legal Validity of the Patient's Informed Consent Used during the Romanian Vaccination Campaign [26](#B26-vaccines-10-01871)]. Only one sentence is dedicated to patient information, which refers to medical personnel being taught to advise patients about potential adverse effects and what to do in this case. [Appendix B](#app2-vaccines-10-01871)). This COVID-19 vaccination consent includes: - Information related to the patient's personal data; - A pre-filled brief description of the medical act (vaccination); - An acknowledgment statement. - There was no law, order, or other regulation issuing this document. We searched the legal database accessible through legislation software (Indaco Lege5 and Sintact) and Google. Nevertheless, we could not identify any official act adopting this informed consent form used during the vaccination campaign. Therefore, we consider that the vaccination informed consent form made available on the vaccination web platform did not have legal grounds. - According to the hierarchic system of laws general principle [ [27](#B27-vaccines-10-01871)] and Romanian law no. 24/2000, any amendment of a normative act in force is permitted only by an act of higher or equal rank. Consequently, at least a Ministry Order was required for the new informed consent to be legitimate. There is one official document related to the vaccination campaign strategy, Health Ministry Order no. 2171/2020, for establishing norms regarding the authorization, organization, and operation of vaccination centers against COVID-19. This order does not mention any derogation regarding the patient's informed consent, but it simply states the necessity for the patient to sign an informed consent form. - The National Committee for Coordination of Activities Regarding Vaccination Against COVID-19 was not legally authorized to amend law no. 95/2006 on health reform and order no. 1411/2016 of the Ministry of Health and, therefore, to alter the informed consent form. [Figure 1](#vaccines-10-01871-f001)). [28](#B28-vaccines-10-01871)]. Under no circumstances should media or online sources substitute for physicians' medical information. [29](#B29-vaccines-10-01871)]. Similarly, the Canadian vaccination guide required the disclosure of minor and severe adverse effects of the vaccine before administration [ [30](#B30-vaccines-10-01871)]. 4. Legal Implications of Deficient Informed Consent during the COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign [31](#B31-vaccines-10-01871)]. Providing the required information after assessing the patient's competence [ [32](#B32-vaccines-10-01871)] and securing the patient's approval fulfills the physician's duty to acquire informed consent. The absence of any mandatory piece of information invalidates the patient's consent. Although physicians are not required to confirm that the patient has comprehended information, they must provide all the mandatory data. [33](#B33-vaccines-10-01871)]. [34](#B34-vaccines-10-01871)]. The physician stated in his defense that he lacked time to notify the patient due to his high patient load. The court decided that physicians have two legal duties: informing the patient about the nature and consequences of the medical investigation and obtaining the patient's written consent. Organizational issues cannot justify violating a patient's fundamental right. [35](#B35-vaccines-10-01871)]. 5. Other Implications 5.1. Medical Malpractice Insurance Agreements [Table 3](#vaccines-10-01871-t003). Supposing that there is no such exclusion in the agreement, the company would pay but has the right to recoup any payments from the physicians who provided medical assistance without informed consent, according to law no. 95/2006. [38](#B38-vaccines-10-01871), [39](#B39-vaccines-10-01871), [40](#B40-vaccines-10-01871)]. However, since the hospital's insurance company would not pay the compensation [ [41](#B41-vaccines-10-01871)], a regressive action against the physician is required by law to recover the payments. 5.2. Low Vaccination Rate [42](#B42-vaccines-10-01871)]. Other European nations share the same problem, but there is no single strategy that should be implemented to combat vaccine reluctance [ [43](#B43-vaccines-10-01871)]. There are many reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy, such as concerns about adverse events, a lack of adequate information, and a failure of vaccination education, publicity, and popularization [ [44](#B44-vaccines-10-01871)]. Removal of any reference of potential complications [ [45](#B45-vaccines-10-01871)] from the informed consent raises public concern regarding the vaccines' side effects. Another reason for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is the lack of communication from trusted providers [ [44](#B44-vaccines-10-01871)]. The most trustworthy providers are and should be vaccination-campaign-involved physicians with access to the mechanism for getting thorough informed consent. [Appendix A](#app1-vaccines-10-01871)) did not aid in creating confidence in vaccination campaigns, as increasing confidence requires providing patients with transparent medical information [ [46](#B46-vaccines-10-01871)]. Additionally, giving personalized communication from reputable sources such as healthcare providers is one potential way to promote vaccine uptake [ [44](#B44-vaccines-10-01871)]. We believe that the informed consent phase is the optimum time to provide information. [47](#B47-vaccines-10-01871)]. [48](#B48-vaccines-10-01871)], they were not dealt with appropriately from a legal point of view. 6. Proposed Changes to the Vaccination Campaign [49](#B49-vaccines-10-01871)]. Italy was the first to mandate vaccinations for healthcare workers by the end of 2021, and for all people over 50 by the start of 2022 [ [50](#B50-vaccines-10-01871)]. Other nations have chosen to respect patients' free will by requiring informed consent, although still imposing restrictions on those who refuse vaccination. [12](#B12-vaccines-10-01871)]. Individual freedom of choice is a powerful argument for those who oppose obligatory vaccination [ [51](#B51-vaccines-10-01871)], and authorities should consider that mandating vaccination could result in a reluctance to be vaccinated [ [52](#B52-vaccines-10-01871)]. Ultimately, it is a political decision, but the state must better prepare the legal framework. [53](#B53-vaccines-10-01871)]. [Figure 2](#vaccines-10-01871-f002)), wherein patients might interact with a physician. Although all documents could be delivered at the registration desk, the receptionist must instruct patients to complete only the triage questionnaires. Every patient should be able to speak with a physician and receive the necessary vaccination information. Research on optimizing patient flow should be conducted to assess the best model for vaccination centers while complying with the relevant laws. 7.
