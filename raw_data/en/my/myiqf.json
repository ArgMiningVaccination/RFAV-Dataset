Management of pregnant women infected with Ebola virus in a treatment centre in Guinea, June 2014. Euro Surveill. 2014;19(49):pii=20983. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20983 Article submitted on 25 November 2014 / published on 11 December 2014 We report two cases of confirmed Ebola virus disease in pregnant women, who presented at the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res Ebola treatment centre in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou. Despite the very high risk of death, both pregnant women survived. In both cases the critical decision was made to induce vaginal delivery. We raise a num - ber of considerations regarding the management of Ebola virus-infected pregnant women, including the place of amniocentesis and induced delivery, and whether certain invasive medical acts are justified. We report two cases of confirmed Ebola virus disease (EVD) in pregnant patients who presented and were treated at the M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) Ebola treatment centre in Gu\u00e9ckedou. We also raise a number of considerations regarding the role of amniocentesis and induced delivery in the management of pregnant women with EVD. Description of the cases Case one Initial presentationAt the beginning of June 2014, a woman in her late 20s at seven months gestation presented at the Ebola treatment centre in Gu\u00e9kedou, Guinea, with a history of seven days of asthenia, fever (self-reported), and vomiting. Her past obstetrical history included six vagi - nal deliveries and no abortions. On admission, physi - cal examination revealed a temperature of 37.1 \u00b0C, mild dehydration and the patient reported fetal movement. The Ebola virus (EBV) test (real-time reverse transcrip - tion-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)) was positive. Clinical course and management On the same day (day 0), the woman was admit - ted to the EBV treatment/isolation unit where she immediately started receiving supportive treatment, Ringer's lactate, antipyretics, ceftriaxone (2 g/day), metoclopramide and omeprazole. The woman responded well to this supportive treatment and by day six of her admission, she was free from symptoms, and reported continuously fetal movements. On day eight and 10, the results of the EBV tests came back nega - tive, and the woman was considered cured. The woman remained in the unit for further monitoring. On day 11, the woman's temperature rose to 38 \u00b0C, and further examination revealed that fetal movements and heartbeat had stopped. Cervical examination showed no uterine contractions, no cervical dilation, no blood or other discharge. Intravenous metronidazole was added for suspected chorioamnionitis. To evaluate the possibility of maternal-to-fetal EBV transmission, an amniocentesis was performed. The clear-coloured amniotic fluid contained a high Ebola viral load (cor - responding to a real-time RT-PCR cycle threshold (CT) value of 21.29). On day 15, the patient was afebrile. An assisted deliv - ery was organised to take place in the high-risk zone of the treatment centre. Labour induction with mis - oprostol resulted in a vaginal delivery of a stillborn male fetus (first degree maceration). The placenta was complete. No episiotomy was required, uterine bi-manual massage, oxytocin (10 Units intravenous) and ergometrine (one vial of 0.2 mg intramuscular) helped obtaining normal uterine retraction and prevented any excessive post-partum bleeding. The samples from the placenta (maternal and fetal side), meconium, and the fetus (intra-cardiac aspiration, throat swab, ear swab, umbilical cord) were EBV positive (Table). The patient was afebrile after delivery, and was discharged on day 18. A seven-days post-natal consultation (PNC) showed a normal evolution.3 www.eurosurveillance.orgCase two Initial presentation In mid-June 2014 a primipara in her early 20s at seven months gestation presented with a history of five days of arthralgia, asthenia, diarrhoea, fever (self-reported) and headache. The patient presented with a history of grade III female genital mutilation (FGM). On admis - sion, the patient had a temperature of 38.4 \u00b0C, and reported fetal movements and no contractions. Clinical course and management On the next day (day 1), the EBV test and malaria rapid test were positive. The patient's fever wors - ened (39.5 \u00b0C), and she had an onset of haematuria and cough. The patient reported fetal movements had stopped. Supportive treatment included intravenous ampicillin and metronidazole for a possible chorioam - nionitis, well as intravenous artesunate (malaria treatment) and Ringer's lactate. On day five, the patient's systolic blood pressure dropped to 60 mmHg (norm: 90-119) and additional fluids were intravenously administered. On day eight, the patient presented with symmetrical oedema of the lower extremities. Obstetrical examination revealed a hypertonic uterus, transverse or breech presentation, no fetal heartbeat, cervical dilation of one centim - eter in diameter, and no discharge. Despite the risk, ketamine anaesthesia was provided, external version manoeuvres were performed, and the fetus was ren - dered in cephalic presentation.Table Test results from maternal and fetal samples taken from two pregnant patients during their stay at the Ebola treatment centre, Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou, Guinea, June 2014 Timeline Specimen typeEbola virus load result (CT value)Semi-quantitative viral load resultOther results Patient 1 Day 0 (admission) Blood (mother) Positive (21.29) + + + Malaria negative Day 8 Blood (mother) Negative (-) -IgG positive ( 1:1,280) IgM positive ( 1:320) Day 10 Blood (mother) Negative (-) - - Day 12 Amniotic fluid (amniocentesis) Positive (23.31) + + + - Day 15Amniotic fluid (fetal mouth swab)Positive (21.41) + + + - Day 15 Amniotic fluid (fetal ear swab) Positive (24.78) + + + - Day 15 Placenta (fetal side) Positive (24,12) + + + - Day 15 Placenta (maternal side) Positive (19,23) + + + - Day 15 Fetal blood - sample 1 Positive (16,13) + + + - Day 15 Fetal blood - sample 2 Positive (23.6) + + + - Day 15 Fetal meconium (anus swab) Positive (20,32) + + + - Day 18 Blood (mother) Negative (-) - - Patient 2 Day 1aBlood (mother) Positive (26.46) + + Malaria positive Day 7 Blood (mother) Positive (25,43) + + - Day 11 Amniotic fluid (mouth swab) Positive (24.10) + + + - Day 11 Amniotic fluid (fetal ear swab) Positive (28.82) + + - Day 11 Placenta (fetal side) Positive (14.22) + + + - Day 11 Placenta (maternal side) Positive (19.98) + + + - Day 11 Fetal meconium (anus swab) Negative (-) - - Day 16 Blood (mother) Negative (-) - - Day 18 Blood (mother) Negative (-) - - CT: cycle threshold; NA: not available; RT-PCR: reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. a Patient 2 first presented at the treatment centre in the afternoon (day 0) so the result of Ebola virus testing was available the next day (day 1). Real-time RT-PCR was performed with the Smart Cycler. The obtained CT values correspond with the accumulation of the fluorescent signal and are inversely proportional with the viral load. CT values are classified in subsequent categories of 0-25, 25-35 and 35-40 and correspond with + + + , + + and + results. When the real-time RT-PCR was negative this is indicated for the viral load by a - result.4 www.eurosurveillance.orgOn day 10, the patient was disoriented and presented with anasarca. On the morning of day 11, the patient was found unconscious, with the fetal head intra-vaginal. Ketamine was administered, an episiotomy was performed, and a male stillborn fetus was deliv - ered vaginally. The placenta was complete. Urinary retention complicated uterine retraction, and uterine bi-manual massage was employed together with the administration of oxytocin (10 U) and ergometrine (1 vial of 0.2mg). Post-partum haemorrhage only stopped after repeatedly (five times) packing the uterus with gauze. Due to the FGM, bladder catheterisation was unsuccessful. Urine was aspirated through a supra-pubic bladder paracentesis (the urine was not tested for EBV). A final vaginal and uterine exploration showed no further complications. The samples from the placenta (maternal and fetal side) and the fetus (throat swab, ear swab) were EBV positive. The sample from the meconium was negative (Table). No pericar - dial puncture was performed. On day 12, the patient regained consciousness, and spontaneous diuresis resumed after a single dose dexamethasone injection. The patient had a tempera - ture of 40 \u00b0C. Gentamicin was added to the treatment. Over the next six days the patient improved clinically. On day 17, the patient was afebrile. On day 16 and 18, EBV tests were negative and the patient was consid - ered cured. The patient was discharged on day 19. She did not attend her scheduled appointment seven-days PNC. Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa In March 2014, an EVD outbreak was declared in Gu\u00e9ckedou, Guinea, following which it spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal and Mali [1,2]. The viral strain responsible for the current outbreak has been identified as the Zaire strain, a particularly virulent strain associated with mortality rates as high as 90% [1]. Overall, by 21 November 2014, 15,351 individuals have become infected and 5,459 of these have died. Among those infected, 588 were healthcare workers and 377 of these have died [2]. Patients with EVD generally present with a history of contact with another person with EVD and an abrupt onset of a non-specific febrile syndrome. A systemic inflammatory response can cause multiple organ failure and shock [3,4]. Pregnant women are reported to be at higher risk to die [5]. Since the onset of the outbreak in Guinea, MSF has set up and is running six Ebola treatment centres - includ - ing one in Gu\u00e9k\u00e9dou where the outbreak began. Discussion There are very few studies reporting on maternal and fetal outcomes of pregnant women infected with EBV. We report on two cases of pregnant women infected with EBV in Guinea. Despite pregnant women being at higher risk of more severe disease and mortality [5], both women survived. Both fetuses unfortunately died in utero. This case report raises a number of important points for discussion regarding the management of pregnant women infected with EBV. Although our findings are based on two cases only, they depict a more positive picture of the maternal outcomes of EVD during pregnancy. In both cases the delivery occurred during the healing phase, when the EBV viraemia in the pregnant woman was controlled, and when clotting had probably returned to normal. During previous outbreaks also caused by the Zaire strain, such as in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) 1976 Yambuku outbreak, only nine (11%) of 82 EBV infected pregnant women were reported to have survived [6]. Similarly, during another EBV outbreak in the DRC 20 years later (1995 in Kikwit) only one (7%) of 15 pregnant women was reported to have survived, and EBV-infected pregnant women had a notably higher mortality rate (93%) than non-pregnant EBV-infected women (70%) [5]. For the current outbreak, data on pregnancy are not routinely reported so overall figures on the survival of pregnant women and their unborn children or neonates are not available at this point. Despite the two women described in this report surviv - ing, in both cases the fetus died in utero. There is not much chance for the fetus to survive EBV infection. A massive infection of the fetus is likely to occur through the placenta. Furthermore maternal immunoglobulins M are poorly transported through placental villi and the fetal secretory immune system starts producing immu - noglobulin M around the 20th week of gestation [7]. Fetal and neonate mortality was equally reported high in other outbreaks. In Yambuku, 11 live neonates were born to EBV-infected women and all died within 19 days [6]. In Yambuku and Kikwit, abortion occurred among 19 of 82 (23%) and 10 of 15 (67%) infected pregnant women respectively [5,6]. In Kikwit the only surviving pregnant patient had an abortion [5]. In Yambuku, one of the nine survivors aborted in the treatment centre. Abortions occurred spontaneously, likely because of fetal death due to EBV infection. Unfortunately the pregnancy outcomes of the other pregnant EVD survi - vors were not reported [6]. This is the first description of the use of amniocentesis to determine the presence of intrauterine EBV infec - tion. In the case of the first patient, despite her having an undetectable viral load and declared cured before the demise of the fetus, a subsequent amniocentesis revealed a high viral load in the amniotic fluid. For this reason, a vaginal delivery was arranged to take place in the high-risk zone of the EVD treatment centre. In the absence of the amniocentesis, the recovered EBV negative patient might have been referred to the local maternity for delivery, exposing the maternity staff to a very high risk of EBV infection. Alternatively, she might have had a spontaneous abortion at home with potential risk of subsequent transmission of EBV to household contacts. In the second case, an emergency 5 www.eurosurveillance.orgdelivery was required and performed at the EVD treat - ment centre after the patient was found in shock, with intra-vaginal fetal head. This delivery also took place in the high-risk zone of the centre and episiotomy was justified due to the grade III FGM. Post-partum, an amniotic fluid sample was taken from the dead fetus through an oral swab and yielded a high EBV viral load. For both cases, the assisted delivery occurred a few days after fetal movement had reportedly stopped. As these were the first induced deliveries of EBV infected pregnant women, careful planning had to be consid - ered as well precautionary measures, given the high risk of nosocomial transmission to healthcare work - ers [3]. Moreover, based on previous reports [5,6], it was also taken into account that spontaneous abor - tions could occur shortly after fetal death, limiting the need for invasive procedures, and reducing the risk to healthcare staff. During both deliveries, strict barrier nursing tech - niques were used. Full protective equipment included scrubs, waterproof overall, apron, boots, N95 masks, head cover, goggles, a double pair of gloves and arm-length gynaecological gloves (three layers of gloving). Absorbent pads were laid underneath the patients to absorb a maximal amount of fluids. Two pads were laid over the abdomen and the perineal region to limit splashing. Biomedical waste was gathered in the immediate proximity of the patient, and regularly sprayed with 0.5% chlorine solution. None of the five healthcare workers who were present during the deliv - eries reported here became infected. These two case presentations raise a number of con - siderations regarding the management of pregnant women infected with EBV including the role of amnio - centesis and induced delivery, and whether certain invasive medical procedures are justified, despite the inherent risk for healthcare workers. In conclusion, our case report adds to the scarce body of literature on the outcomes of pregnant women infected with EBV. We also highlight some important considerations in the management of such patients and describe, for the first time, the use of amniocente - sis to detect fetal infection with EBV.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20986 Article submitted on 07 May 2014 / published on 11 December 2014 Resistance to cephalosporins in Haemophilus influen - zae is usually caused by characteristic alterations in penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3), encoded by the ftsI gene. Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalo - sporins is associated with high-level PBP3-mediated resistance (high-rPBP3), defined by the second stage S385T substitution in addition to a first stage sub - stitution (R517H or N526K). The third stage L389F substitution is present in some high-rPBP3 strains. High-rPBP3 H. influenzae are considered rare outside Japan and Korea. In this study, 30 high-rPBP3 iso - lates from Norway, collected between 2006 and 2013, were examined by serotyping, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), ftsI concen - tration (MIC) determination. MICs were interpreted according to clinical breakpoints from the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). Respiratory isolates predominated (propor - tion: 24/30). The 30 isolates included one serotype f isolate, while the remaining 29 lacked polysaccha - ride capsule genes. Resistance substitution in PBP3 was pre - sent in 23 of 30 isolates; these included a blood iso - late which represents the first invasive S385T + N526K isolate reported from Europe. The L389F substitution, present in 16 of 30 isolates, coincided with higher beta-lactam MICs. Non-susceptibility to meropenem was frequent in + N526K isolates (8/12). All 11 beta-lactamase positive isolates were TEM-1. Five clonal groups of two to 10 isolates with identical MLST- ftsI allelic profiles were observed, including the first this study, no multidrug resistant high-rPBP3 H. influenzae had been reported in Norway. Intensified surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is needed to guide empiric therapy. Introduction Haemophilus influenzae colonises the respiratory tract in humans and infection causes a wide range of con - ditions, including acute otitis media, arthritis, con - junctivitis, respiratory septicaemia and sinusitis [1]. Encapsulated isolates of serotype b (Hib) have the highest potential for invasive disease but the introduction of Hib vac - cines has dramatically reduced the burden of disease. Thus, the vast majority of infections, both invasive and non-invasive, are currently caused by nontypeable (i.e. lacking polysaccharide capsule) H. mainly serotype the global emergence of beta-lactamase (TEM-1 and ROB-1) producing strains in the 1970s, empiric therapy for severe disease caused by H. influenzae was altered from ampicillin to cephalosporins [4]. Development of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins has forced a second shift in empiric treatment to carbapenems in some geographical areas [4]. The European Committee on Antimicrobial 7 www.eurosurveillance.orgSusceptibility Testing (EUCAST) resist - enzae as an exceptional phenotype [5]. Considering such isolates 'very rare or not yet reported', EUCAST recommend that they are sent to a reference labora - tory [6]. Notably, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints for cephalosporins and H. influenzae from EUCAST are considerably lower than those from Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI): for instance, the susceptible minimum inhibitory concen - tration (MIC) breakpoint for cefotaxime the CLSI breakpoint is 2 g/mL [7]. Resistance to cephalosporins is due to alterations in the transpeptidase domain of penicillin-binding pro - tein 3 (PBP3), encoded by the ftsI gene, with pheno - typic resistance profiles depending on amino acid substitution patterns. Several genotypic classification systems for PBP3-mediated resistance (rPBP3) have been suggested and the terminology is still develop - ing [4,8-13]. Acquirement of one of the substitutions R517H or N526K represents the first stage of resistance development. The second stage substitution S385T is associated with increased resistance to cefotaxime and separates high-level resistant (high-rPBP3) iso - lates from those with low-level resistance (low-rPBP3) [4,12,13]. High-rPBP3 strains may be divided into group III + N526K) and group III-like (S385T + R517H) [9-11]. The additional L389F substitution is associated with further increased resistance levels in high-rPBP3 strains and may be considered the third stage in devel - opment of PBP3-mediated resistance [13]. High-rPBP3 isolates became frequent in Japan in the late 1990s [14] and in Korea during the 2000s [15]. A similar development in other geographical areas would compromise current empiric antimicrobial therapy in severe infections, which is largely based on third-generation cephalosporins. However, low-rPBP3 H. influenzae , lacking the S385T and mainly susceptible to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, still predom - inate in south-west and northern Europe [2,8,11,16]. In previous systematic surveys outside Asia where deter - mination of PBP3 amino acid substitution patterns has been performed [2,3,8,11,16-19], very few group III iso - lates have been reported [1]; these include one inva - sive isolate from Canada [19], one otitis media isolate from France [16] and one upper respiratory tract isolate from Norway [8]. Group III-like isolates have been more frequently reported in Europe [1,3,8,11,16,18]. Since 2007, the Norwegian Working Group on Antibiotics (NWGA) has recommended that cefotaxime resistant H. influenzae isolates are sent to the reference laboratory for ftsI sequencing and susceptibility test - ing with broth microdilution. In Norway, this is carried out at Vestfold Hospital Trust, in collaboration with the Haemophilus Reference Laboratory at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the Norwegian National Advisory Unit on Detection of Antimicrobial Resistance at the University Hospital of North Norway. We present here susceptibility profiles, resistance genotypes and molecular strain characteristics of 30 high-rPBP3 iso - lates from Norway, defined by the S385T substitution, collected between May 2006 and July 2013. Methods Isolates A total of 30 clinical high-rPBP3 (S385T positive) H. influenzae isolates from Norway, isolated at 10 differ - ent routine laboratories between May 2006 and July 2013, were included in the study. Of the 30 high-rPBP3 isolates, 27 (from 7 laboratories) with the S385T sub - stitution were identified by partial ftsI sequencing of 39 routine isolates (from 10 laboratories) with cefo - taxime MIC > 0.12 mg/L (gradient test); the remaining 12 isolates were categorised as group II low-rPBP3 (N526K positive, S385T negative) and had cefotaxime MIC = 0.25 mg/L (n = 10) or 0.5 mg/L (n = 2) by gradi - ent test. We also included three isolates (isolates 4-6) from three additional laboratories, collected in 2007 and identified as high-rPBP3 through a previous sur - veillance study [8]. The 10 laboratories contributing the 30 isolates were located in mid Norway (Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag county), the Oslo region (Akershus, Buskerud, Oslo and Vestfold counties), Western Norway (Sogn og Fjordane, Hordaland and Rogaland counties) and Southern Norway (Agder county). Pure cultures were kept frozen at -70 \u00b0C in Microbank vials (Pro-Laboratory Diagnostics, Ontario, Canada) pending further characterisation. Demographic and clinical data Information about sample types, demographic data and brief clinical information (provided by the clinician at the time of sampling) were acquired from the pri - mary laboratories. Three recently hospitalised patients with X-ray confirmed pneumonia most likely caused by study isolates were selected as case reports. For these patients, relevant supplementary information about diagnosis, antimicrobial therapy and clinical outcome was extracted from the patient files. Species identification and molecular characterisation Species identification was carried out by API NH (bio - M\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France), matrix-assisted laser (Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany), and methods, including absence of beta-haemolysis on blood agar. Amplification of the fucK gene when performing multi - locus sequence typing (MLST) (see below) was used as an additional criterion to separate H. influenzae from H. haemolyticus; all included isolates were fucK positive. Biotypes [20] were determined using indole, urease and produced by API NH (bioM\u00e9rieux).8 www.eurosurveillance.orgCapsular serotyping was performed at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health according to previously described methodology [21] with modifications (under - scored) to the frdB, fucK, mdh, pgi and recA was carried out at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health according to standard procedures [22]. Sequences were registered at http://haemophilus.mlst.net. Sequence types (ST) were assigned according to allelic profiles. STs were divided into clonal complexes (CC) (named according to founder) using eBURST Version 3 (http://haemophilus.mlst.net/eburst). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of selected - lates was carried out at Unilabs Telelab (Skien, Norway) as previously described [17] and clonal was interpreted according to the Tenover criteria [23].

An with cU32793) was used as reference and H. parainfluenzae (European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) acces ftsI alleles) were assigned numbers (1-10) according to frequency of occurrence and used together with MLST allelic profiles for assign - ment to clonal groups (CG) (see below). Deduced PBP3 amino acid sequences (338-573) were compared with H. influenzae Rd KW20 and sequence patterns (denoted PBP3 types) were assigned num - bers (1-7) according frequency of occurrence. The substitutions S385T, R517H and N526K were used for categorisation into PBP3 group III and group III-like [9-11]. For isolates with the third stage substitution L389F, the suffix ' + ' was added. The following group designations were thus used: group III groups respectively correspond to PBP3 classes II, III, V and VI, proposed by Osaki et al. [13]. Clonal groups According to a previously described approach to molec - ular typing of H. influenzae [4], CGs were defined as isolates with identical MLST- allelic profiles and numbered chronologically [1-5]. GyrA and ParC amino acid substitutions For isolates with ciprofloxacin MIC > 0.06 mg/L and/or levofloxacin MIC > 0.03 the (QRDR) of gyrA and parC were characterised by PCR methodology adapted from a previous report [26].

In the age group zero to nine years, most patients (proportion: 10/13) were below five years-old. The male/female ratio was 13/17. All but two patients lived in the Oslo region (14/30) or in Western Norway (14/30). Except for the patient with isolate 23, recently returning from Thailand, there was no known recent (< 3 months) travel history abroad (Table 1). Ten isolates (10/30) were from hospitalised patients. The proportion of hospitalised patients was 4/21 in the period between 2006 and 2012 compared to 6/9 in 2013. One of the 30 isolates was from blood; the rest were eye (2/30), ear (3/30) or respiratory isolates (24/30). Among the patients for whom clinical infor - mation was available (n=23), pneumonia (n=7) and acute otitis media (AOM) (n=5) were the most frequent infection types. At least seven of the 30 patients were predisposed for respiratory tract infections due to underlying chronic condition (Table 1). Strain characterisation All isolates but one (Hif) lacked polysaccharide capsule genes and were categorised as nontypeable The isolates were biotypes I using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and based on ftsI DNA sequences (transpeptidase nucleotides Rd (GenBank accession number: U32793) as reference and H. parainfluenzae Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) accession number: AB267856) as outgroup.

The Hif isolate and the blood iso - late were both biotype I. Twelve STs were represented, including ST1282 and ST1287 not previously registered in the MLST database (Table 1). Eleven of the 12 STs belonged to nine CCs; the last (ST1287) could not be assigned to a CC. ST1197 (CC395) was the most frequent ST (10/30). Two STs (ST1197 and ST836) encompassed both biotype III (ODC negative) isolates positive). ftsI/PBP3 genotypes Ten ftsI alleles, encoding seven PBP3 substitution types and carried by one to 10 isolates, were observed (Table 1). Two ftsI alleles ( ftsI-2 and ftsI-4 ) were present in unrelated STs (Figure 1). The majority of isolates (proportion: 23/30) had the N526K first stage substitution and were thus catego - rised as group III (11/30) or group III+ (12/30). Seven isolates (7/30) had the R517H first stage substitution and were thus categorised as group III-like (3/30) or group III-like+ (4/30). The third stage substitution L389F was present in 16 of 30 isolates (Table 1). Clonal groups Five clusters comprising two to 10 isolates with iden - tical MLST- ftsI allelic profiles (clonal groups, CG) were identified, accounting for 22 of 30 isolates. Eight isolates of 30 had unique MLST- ftsI allelic profiles, including the single Hif isolate and the single invasive isolate (Table 1). CG2 (n = 10 isolates) was found in two separate geo - graphical regions (Oslo region and Western Norway) during a period of three years. To confirm genetic relationship, PFGE of seven isolates belonging to CG2 (one beta-lactamase positive and six beta-lactamase negative isolates) was performed, and four related pulsotypes (1-4) were observed (Figure 2). Pulsotypes 2 (n = 2), 3 (n = 1) and 4 (n = 1) differed from pulsotype 1 (n = 3) by two, two and three bands, respectively. Pulsotype 1 was observed in both geographical regions. No pulsotypes differed by more than five bands. The three CG4 isolates were sampled during a period of four days from one hospitalised patient and two outpa - tients related to the same hospital. CG5 (n = 4) included two patients from the same household (patients 27 and 28) and was restricted to one hospital department within a period of 16 days. The clonal groups (and the single strains) differed con - siderably with respect to PBP3 resistance genotypes and co-resistance (Table 1). Notably, in contrast to CG1 and CG2, the third stage L389F substitution was present in CG3, CG4 and CG5. isolates of clonal group 2, Norway, 2006-2013 (n=7) Isolate Year County Region Pulsotype Std 2 2007 Ve O 3 15 2010 SF W 1 13 2009 SF W 2 Std 12 2009 SF W 2 14 2009 SF W 1 8 2008 Ve O 1 4 2007 Os O 4 Std O: county; W: Western Norway.

In general, strains with the N526K first stage substitution had higher MICs to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (except cefixime) than R517H strains. Furthermore, the third stage L389F substitution was generally associ - ated with higher MICs to extended-spectrum cepha - losporins and Notably, isolates S385T L389F) were non-sus - ceptible to meropenem (Table 3).Individual susceptibility profiles and resistance geno - types are shown in Figure 3. In contrast to other group III isolates, the single invasive ST1287 isolate (isolate number 18) was categorised as susceptible to ampicil - lin (MIC = 1 mg/L), cefotaxime (MIC 0.12 mg/L), cef - triaxone cefixime (MIC = 0.12 mg/L) and cefepime (MIC = 0.25 mg/L). Conversely, the sin - gle ST124 Hif isolate (isolate number 21) generally expressed higher resistance levels to beta-lactams than other group III+ isolates. Figure 3.

Co-resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (13/30) was frequent. Four of 30 isolates were resistant to chlorampheni - col and tetracycline, including the three CG4 isolates and a single isolate belonging to the same clonal complex (CC503) as those forming the CG4. No iso - lates expressed increased resistance to macrolides or rifampicin (Table 3). Five of 30 isolates had ciprofloxacin MIC > 0.06 mg/L and possessed amino acid substitutions in the QRDR of GyrA and/or ParC . Three isolates, all belonging to CG4, had substitutions in both proteins and were clinically resistant to ciprofloxacin. Two isolates, both CG3, had only one significant GyrA substitution and quinolone MICs within the susceptible category (Table 4). Case reports The clinical course was evaluated for three patients with well-defined serious infections most likely caused by one of the study isolates (patients and isolates 18, 27 and 28). Isolate 18 was cultured from the blood of a patient with X-ray confirmed pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypogam - maglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and myasthenia gravis (Table 1). The strain was catego - rised as susceptible to cefotaxime (MIC 0.12 mg/L, Figure 3). The patient responded well to initial paren - teral therapy with cefotaxime (three days) followed by ciprofloxacin orally.Isolates 27 and 28 belonged to CG5 and were beta-lac - tamase positive and resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam (MIC = 8 mg/L) and cefotaxime (MIC = 1 mg/L) accord - ing to EUCAST breakpoints [6]. Both were isolated from sputum in patients with X-ray confirmed pneu - monia 160 Patient 27 (cardiovas - cular disease) responded to therapy with cefotaxime (dosage 2 g three times a day) after initial treatment with benzylpenicillin. Patient 28 (disseminated cancer) responded to ciprofloxacin after initial treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam. Discussion We have characterised 30 clinical H. influenzae isolates from Norway with high-level PBP3-mediated beta-lac - tam resistance, including 23 isolates possessing both the S385T and N526K substitutions. Previously, iso - lates with this genotype (group III and group III+) have primarily been reported from Japan [14] and Korea [15]. The prevalence of low-rPBP3 in respiratory NTHi in Norway has increased gradually since 2001 and was estimated to 15% in 2007; 113 low-rPBP3 and three high-rPBP isolates (isolates 4-6 in this study) were reported among 795 surveillance isolates in 2007 [8]. When the prevalence of low-rPBP3 in Japan in the 1990s reached approximately the same level as in Norway in 2007, the prevalence of high-rPBP3 isolates increased from zero to 29% in few years [14]. Similar observations were reported from Korea during the 2000s [15].

All isolates were susceptible to general breakpoints (2/2).14 www.eurosurveillance.orgrecent review article [1]. Emphasising the emergence and spread of strains with PBP3-mediated resistance, the authors recommended implementation of standard - ised surveillance protocols and typing methodologies. We recently suggested MLST- ftsI typing as a tool for molecular surveillance of PBP3-mediated resistance in H. influenzae [8]. By this approach, DNA-based resis - totyping using the transpeptidase region as an addi - tional allele is combined with MLST allelic profiles. This sequence is readily available if PBP3 resistance genotyping is done by sequencing. In that study [8], MLST clonal complexes corresponded well to PFGE clusters. Addition of the ftsI allele to MLST allelic pro - files increased the discriminatory power compared with MLST alone and MLST combined with PBP3 substitu - tion patterns, without compromising consistency with PFGE-based grouping. The observation that CG2 in the present study (and most MLST- ftsI types in the previ - ous study) encompassed related pulsotypes supports the validity of the typing scheme although discrimina - tory power is inferior to PFGE. Increasing the length of the ftsI fragment could improve resolution but this would most likely be at the cost of reduced sensitivity for clone detection. So far, the molecular epidemiology of high-rPBP3 strains is poorly described. However, two invasive group III-like isolates recently reported from Spain had MLST allelic profiles (ST155 and ST1118) identical or closely related to CG1 in the present study; the Spanish isolates and CG1 also had identical PBP3 substitution patterns as far as comparison is possible [3]. These observations suggest that CG1 and the two Spanish isolates may be representatives of a virulent high-rPBP3 NTHi clone distributed within Europe.Figure CGs (identical MLST- ftsI profiles, Table 1); B, PBP3 resistance genotypes (grouped according to substitutions in positions 385, 389, 517 and 526, Table 1); C, co-resistance to non-beta-lactam antimicrobial agents (number of to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and meropenem.

In this study, CG4 and CG5 were respectively restricted to one hospital (both hospitals located in Western Norway) and sampled within short time periods. Two of the CG5 isolates were sampled from persons within the same household. Person-to-person transmission of nontypeable H. influenzae has been reported previ - ously, including an outbreak with an amoxicillin-resist - ant strain in a respiratory ward [27] and intrafamilial transmission of rPBP3 strains [28]. These observations highlight the importance of hygiene measures in health institutions to prevent nosocomial spread. The observation of identically mutated ftsI alleles in unrelated STs suggests horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Similar observations have been reported by us previ - ously [8]. Thus, resistant strains may have developed in Norway by HGT of alleles conferring resistance; these alleles may have been imported at an earlier stage or have evolved locally. The observation of allele mosaicism in H. influenzae [29] supports this interpre - tation and strongly suggests that allele transfer has occurred via transformation and recombination with the chromosome. By EUCAST clinical breakpoints [6], all isolates were categorised as resistant to at least one extended-spectrum cephalosporin. Clinically relevant differ - ences in resistance profiles between PBP3 groups were observed. Isolates possessing the third stage substitution L389F were generally more resistant to cephalosporins than the remaining isolates, consistent with the results of a previous investigation using site-directed mutagenesis and transformation to study the impact of PBP3 on beta-lactam suscep - tibility [13]. Notably, most L389F positive isolates in the present study were ceftriaxone resistant, while all isolates lacking this substitution were ceftriaxone sus - ceptible. The three-stage classification system used in this study, separating between isolates with and with - out the L389F substitution, appears to reflect the step - wise development of PBP3-mediated resistance better than systems based on S385T and R517H/N526K only. We evaluated the effectiveness of the antimicrobial therapy for three patients with X-ray confirmed pneu - monia associated with study strains. Notably, one patient responded to therapy with high dosage of cefo - taxime although the isolate (from sputum) was catego - rised as resistant (MIC = 1 mg/L) according to EUCAST clinical breakpoints [6]. This is consistent with current EUCAST non-species related breakpoints for cefotax - ime based on a dose of at least 2 g three times a day (R > 2 mg/L) [6]. The isolate would have been catego - rised as susceptible to cefotaxime by CLSI breakpoints H. influenzae (S 2 g/mL) [7]. The single ST1287 blood isolate from an immunocom - promised patient with pneumonia is to our knowledge the first reported invasive group III high-rPBP3 isolate from Europe. This strain generally expressed lower MICs to beta-lactams than noninvasive group III study isolates and was categorised as cefotaxime suscep - tible (MIC 0.12 mg/L). The patient responded well to cefotaxime therapy. Conversely, the single Hif group III+ isolate was more resistant than nontypeable isolates with compa - rable genotypes. These observations suggest that Table 4 GyrA/ParC amino acid substitutions in Haemophilus raised = 0.25 0.25 L - - - R 23 0.25 0.25 L - - - R 24 2 1 L N I S - 25 2 1 L N I S - 26 2 1 L N I S - CIP: ciprofloxacin; LEV: levofloxacin; MIC: minimum inhibitory concentration; MICs 0.06 mg/L and levofloxacin MICs 0.03 mg/L. b Further characteristics are described in Table 1. c European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) clinical breakpoints [6]. www.eurosurveillance.orgstrain-associated mechanisms other than PBP3 sub - stitutions may modify resistance levels in rPBP3 iso - lates. Increased efflux due to mutations in the acrR gene, encoding a repressor of the AcrAB efflux pump, is associated with high-level macrolide resistance in H. influenzae and may increase resistance to ampicillin in rPBP3 strains [30]. The acrR gene was not sequenced in the present study but all isolates expressed wild-type MICs to macrolides. Co-resistance was more frequent than expected. The proportions of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resist - ant and beta-lactamase positive isolates were twice and three times, respectively, the overall reported prevalences in respiratory H. influenzae isolates (n = 677) in a Norwegian nationwide surveillance study in 2011 [31]. Similarly, resistance rates for ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and chloramphenicol 0.7% in the 2011 sur - veillance report. EUCAST define resistance to ciprofloxacin as an excep - tional phenotype in H. influenzae and recommend that such isolates are referred to a reference laboratory [5,6]. Quinolone resistance in this species is usually due to QRDR substitutions in subunit A of topoisomer - topoisomerase IV Resistance levels depend largely on the number of substitutions in the positions 84 and 88 in both pro - teins [32]. Isolates with single substitutions are usu - ally low-level resistant but other mechanisms such as the transferable plasmid-mediated acetyl transferase gene aac(6')-lb-cr may increase resistance [33,34]. The QRDR substitution patterns and quinolone MICs observed in this study are consistent with previous reports [26,32]. The nalidixic acid 30 g disk is supe - rior to the ciprofloxacin 5 g disk for detection of iso - lates with low-level quinolone resistance and may be used for screening [6,26]. Quinolone resistance in H. influenzae is associated with hypermutability [33]. It seems likely that hyper - mutability also increases the ability to acquire PBP3 substitutions by spontaneous mutations, favouring the development of strains with both resistance mecha - nisms. To our knowledge, CG4 represent the first cipro - floxacin-resistant high-rPBP3 isolates reported outside Japan, and the first clonal cluster ever with this particu - lar combination of resistance mechanisms. The CG4 isolates had TEM-1 beta-lactamase and were resistant to chloramphenicol, tetracycline and tri - methoprim-sulfamethoxazole. This resistance profile suggests the presence of a conjugative large plasmid [35], now recognised as an integrating and conjugative element (ICE) designated ICE Hin1056 [36]. The resisto - type of CG4 might thus be the result of two independ - ent factors: hypermutability, leading to PBP3 and of ICE Hypermutable influenzae are prevalent in cystic fibrosis patients [37]. One CG4 isolate was found in sputum from a CF patient; another isolate was from nasopharynx of a patient with primary ciliary dyski - nesia (PCD). High antibiotic pressure in these patient categories may contribute to selection of multidrug resistant strains. The ST of CG4 (ST159) is associated with increased viru - lence in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to an additional IgA1 protease, encoded by the igaB gene [38]. The emergence of clonally related high-rPBP3 isolates in Norway is a cause for concern. As previously reported from Japan and Korea, a shift from low-level to high-level rPBP3 might alter the epidemiological situation dramatically in few years [14,15]. A similar development in Europe would threaten current recommendations for empiric antimicrobial treatment in severe disease [1]. The situation urges for improved surveillance systems for antimicrobial resistance in H. influenzae in Europe. Acknowledgements This work was supported by a grant from Vestfold Hospital Trust.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20982 Article submitted on 18 March 2014 / published on 11 December 2014 This paper describes the epidemiology and manage - ment of a prolonged outbreak of measles across the 2.7 million conurbation of Greater Manchester in the United Kingdom. Over a period of one year (from October 2012 to September 2013), over a thousand suspected measles cases (n = 1,073) were notified across Greater Manchester; of these, 395 (37%) were laboratory-confirmed, 91 (8%) were classed as proba - ble, 312 (29%) were classed as possible and 275 (26%) excluded. Most confirmed and probable cases occurred in children within two age groups - infants (too young to be eligible for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vac - cination according to the national immunisation pro - gramme) and children aged 10-19 years (low vaccine uptake in this cohort because of unfounded alleged links between the MMR vaccine and autism). During this one year period, there were a series of local out - breaks and many of these occurred within the second - ary school setting. A series of public health measures were taken to control this prolonged outbreak: setting up incident management teams to control local out - breaks, a concerted immunisation catch-up campaign (initially local then national) to reduce the pool of chil - dren partially or totally unprotected against measles, and the exclusion of close contacts from nurseries and school settings for a period of 10 days following the last exposure to a case of measles. Background The number of notified measles cases in Europe fell from 28,203 to 7,499 between 2003 and 2009 [1]. Since then, there have been a number of measles outbreaks especially in central and western Europe, with a peak of cases reported in 2011 (32,124 cases reported) [1,2]. France was the most affected country, with 47% of cases in Europe in 2011, while several other countries have also reported a considerable number of cases including Bulgaria, Germany, Italy, Romania, Spain, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom (UK) [1,2]. In the UK, a measles-containing vaccine was intro - duced into the national childhood immunisation schedule in 1968. Since 1988, the combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine has been used [3]. In the early 1990s, the number of confirmed cases of measles fell significantly from ca 80,000 cases in 1988 to ca 100 cases in 2000, as uptake of MMR vac - cination increased, to the point where sustained trans - mission was interrupted [4]. Unfounded fears about a potential link between MMR vaccine and autism [5,6] in the late 1990s damaged public confidence in MMR vaccine, reduced uptake, and increased the risk of sus - tained transmission [7,8] leading to the number of con - firmed measles cases in England and Wales increasing to above 1,000 in 2008 and remaining above 1,000 since, except for the year 2010 when 380 cases were confirmed. In the UK, recent outbreaks have mainly occurred in areas or specific groups with known low coverage of MMR vaccination [9]. Greater Manchester is a city region in the north-west of England with a population of around 2.7 million, administratively divided into 10 local authorities with different population sizes and characteristics. Recent MMR vaccine uptake has been high, with 93.3% of chil - dren having received their first dose of MMR vaccine by their second birthday in 2011-2012 (national mean: 91.2%) and 88.1% of children having received two doses of MMR vaccine by their fifth birthday in 2011-2012 (national mean: 86%) [10]. However, there was an under-vaccinated cohort aged between 10 and 16 years across Greater Manchester, estimated at 31,600 children in April 2013. Of these, 11,993 were totally unvaccinated, and 19,644 had 20 www.eurosurveillance.orgreceived only one dose of MMR vaccine [11]. Of those aged 10-16 years in Greater Manchester, 10.4% were thought to be susceptible to measles [12]. This cohort has been the target of previous local catch-up vacci - nation campaigns with varying success [12] and was being targeted by a national catch-up vaccination cam - paign (2013-2014) [13]. Surveillance system in England All doctors in England and Wales must notify the 'Proper Officer' of the relevant local authority (usually staff of the local Public Health England Centre) of clin - ically-suspected cases of measles. Other clinicians are encouraged to do the same. The local Public Health England (PHE) team will record and undertake local follow-up including assessing how likely this is to be measles. The local team will send an oral fluid swab kit to the suspected case. This kit is designed for use by the patient and is posted directly to the Virus Reference Department, PHE Microbiology Services Colindale, London (the national reference lab - oratory) for IgM / IgG and RNA testing.Test results are sent to both the relevant clinician and PHE. All laboratories in England notify PHE of confirmed measles cases. PHE receives and collates reported cases with a negative result and positive cases and reports confirmed cases to the European surveillance network (EUVAC-NET) on a monthly basis. This is described in more detail elsewhere [14]. In this report, we describe a prolonged outbreak of measles in Greater Manchester, the control measures that were taken and the lessons learned. Methods This report includes all reported cases of measles in residents of Greater Manchester between 1 October 2012 and 30 September 2013. Case definitions Case definitions were primarily devised for case man - agement purposes and were adapted from national guidelines [3] to fit the local epidemiology of the outbreak. The national case management guidelines separate likely (probable) cases and unlikely (possi - ble) cases. These are consistent with those used in a recently published outbreak report [15].Table Number of notifications of suspected and confirmed cases of measles, Greater Manchester, England, 2007-2013 Year of receipt of notifications Total number of notifications receivedNumber of laboratory-confirmed measles cases among the notifications received 2007 212 22 2008 235 26 2009 394 40 2010 310 30 2011 246 21 2012 664 149 2013 894 229 Figure 1Number of confirmed, probable and possible cases of measles by week of rash onset, Greater Manchester, England, October 2012-September 2013 (n=798) 05101520253035404550Conrmed Prob able PossibleOct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct 2012 2013Num ber/uni00A0of/uni00A0cases Date (month, year)21 www.eurosurveillance.orgConfirmed case: measles IgM-positive result in blood or oral fluid in the absence of a history of recent vac - cination or confirmed wild measles RNA positive in any clinical specimen. Probable case: case notified by a clinician as suspected measles who was not fully vaccinated with two doses of MMR vaccine and met one or more of the following criteria: (i) epidemiological link (recent contact with a laboratory-confirmed case of measles); (ii) member of the travelling community or orthodox Jewish com - munity; (iii) link to a setting with a known outbreak; or (iv) aged over 16. Such cases are classified as likely as per national guidelines. If a laboratory result was received for a probable case, they were reclassified as confirmed or discarded depending on the result. Possible case: case notified by a clinician as suspected measles but not meeting the above criteria (classified as unlikely as per national guidelines [1]). If a labora - tory result was received for a possible case, they were reclassified as confirmed or discarded depending on the result.Discarded case: a previously notified case with nega - tive test result at the national reference laboratory in an adequate and appropriately timed specimen of oral fluid or blood. Cases notified who were from the orthodox Jewish com - munity and the travelling community were considered to be more likely to be actual measles based on known low vaccine coverage in these groups, increased risk of introduction of measles and recent local epidemiology.Confirmed, probable and where appropriate, possi - ble cases were included in this analysis whereas dis - carded cases were excluded. To ensure that this report describes a single outbreak, cases (and associated contacts) with confirmed genotype other than D8 were excluded. Only one case with a genotype other than D8 was identified during the period reported here: a case with genotype B3. Reporting clinicians were asked to submit samples for local PCR by the PHE laboratory in Manchester, where possible. A salivary testing kit was posted to all reported cases for self-administration and direct return to the national reference laboratory.Figure 2 Measles rates by Middle Super Output Area (MSOAs)a, Greater Manchester, England, October 2012-September 2013 (n=486 probable and confirmed cases) Rate per 100,000 population 120 and above (6 MSOAs) 90 to 120 (2 MSOAs) 60 to 90 (9 MSOAs) 30 to 60 (36 MSOAs) 1 to 30 (81 MSOAs) a Super Output Areas (SOAs) are small areas of consistent size across the country used by the United Kingdom Office for National Statistics and are not subjected to regular boundary change.

If two or more cases were linked to a particular setting, further inves - tigation was undertaken, including social network analysis. Social network diagrams were drawn using Microsoft Visio. Strategic coordination Outbreak control teams (OCT) were established for affected individual local authorities, with oversight by a Measles Strategy Group. The strategy group reviewed case definitions based on the evolving epidemiology of the outbreak and agreed on the strategy for optimising efficiency of the overall outbreak response. In specific geographical areas, for specific periods of time where community transmission of measles was considered endemic, MMR vaccination was prioritised over the public health management of cases and contacts. Proactive and reactive communication strategies were agreed by the strategy group. Examples include pro - active engagement with local media through press releases and interviews, and regular updates which were communicated to local authorities affected by the outbreak and to clinical networks throughout Greater Manchester.Results Outbreak description Between 1 October 2012 and 30 September 2013, 1,073 suspected cases of measles in Greater Manchester residents were reported by clinicians and laboratories (Figure 1). This was significantly higher than expected (Table). Of these cases, 670 were tested. Of all sus - pected cases reported by clinicians and laboratories, 395 (37%) were confirmed, 91 (8%) were classed as probable, 312 (29%) were classed as possible and 275 (26%) were discarded after laboratory results were known. The highest number of reports in one week was in April 2013 (Figure 1). The outbreak mainly affected four of ten Greater Manchester local authority areas: Bolton and Wigan initially, then Salford, and lastly, Manchester (Figure 2). In 2013, there was a sharp decrease in the number of cases notified, following the start of the summer school holidays (from the end of July until early September) (Figure 1). Two peaks were seen in the age distribution (Figure 3): those aged under two years and those aged 10-14 years. If possible cases were included (data not shown) the under two-year-olds peak would be more pronounced, probably as younger children are more Figure 3 Measles-mumps-rubella vaccination status by age of confirmed and probable measles cases, Greater Manchester, England, October 2012-September 2013 www.eurosurveillance.orglikely to present to health services with rash illnesses. Information on age was available for all possible, prob - able and confirmed cases. The median age among con - firmed cases alone was 21 years (range 0-52 years), and among confirmed and probable cases, 23 years (range 0 to 52 years). Among probable and confirmed cases 54% (264) were male. The majority of probable and confirmed cases were in those who had not had two doses of MMR vaccine. Of 486 probable and con - firmed cases, only 56 cases (12%) were fully vaccinated with two doses of MMR vaccine (Figure 3). Among the 486 confirmed and probable cases, 69 (14%) cases did not know if they were vaccinated ('Not known' in Figure 3). Of these, almost 50% were above 30 years of age. Schools and social networks More than 40 educational settings were involved in this outbreak, mainly secondary schools. Eight schools had more than five cases each. The two schools with the highest number of cases (ca 20) were both large sec - ondary schools (over 1,000 pupils) with similar num - bers of children who had received one dose or no dose of MMR vaccine in each school.Due to the high proportion of susceptible 10-19 year-olds in secondary schools and the high levels of social interaction within secondary schools, a number of secondary schools were identified as probable sites of transmission. On average, within the same school, 56% (95% confidence interval (CI): 44-67) of second - ary cases were in the same year group as the index case, and this proportion increased with index case age, suggesting that compared with younger school year groups, in the older school year groups, transmis - sion events were more likely to occur between children from the same school year group (unpublished data). Members of the Measles Strategy Group reviewed peri - odically the confirmed and probable cases along with any associated educational or community settings, and produced the network diagram. This network diagram was found useful to the team handling the outbreak to get a quick view of the spread of the disease. Laboratory results In total, 670 of the cases linked to this outbreak were tested. Genotype D8 was the predominant genotype identified in cases.Data on hospitalisations due to secondary complica - tions were not of adequate quality to enable analysis.Figure 4 Example of a social network diagram representing transmission events in a high school and in household settings High school ACase CaseNurseryCase Case CasePrimary schoolCaseCaseHigh school B CaseCase Case school Case CaseLaboratory-conrmed case Prob able case Siblin g of household contact Association with settingCase24 www.eurosurveillance.orgControl measures It was not feasible or possible to formally evaluate the local control measures implemented due to resource limitations and associated opportunity cost to the health protection team, and the challenges of finding an appropriate design for evaluation which would have allowed us to measure any impact and attribute this to the intervention. Where possible, we attempted to measure impact of intervention using crude measures such as comparison of the number of pre- and post-intervention transmission events, but it was judged that this method was too crude to obtain valid and pub - lishable results. Management of cases Notified cases were managed by the Greater Manchester Health Protection Team according to national guide - lines [16]: where possible [3], confirmed or probable cases of measles were: (i) isolated (while in a health - care setting), (ii) advised to avoid contact with vulnera - ble people, and (iii) excluded from work or educational activities, for the duration of their infectious period. Particular attention was given to cases (or susceptible contacts) who were healthcare workers. For them, a longer exclusion period of 21 days was advised, in line with UK guidelines [3]. For susceptible household contacts of a probable or confirmed case (i.e. contacts with no history of either natural measles infection or having received a measles containing vaccine), exclusion from educational set - tings (child-minder, nursery, primary school, second - ary school, college or university) was recommended for 10 days following onset of rash in the index case. This was based on the assumption that transmission from index case to contact in this continuous exposure scenario would occur four days before appearance of the rash in the index case (the start of the infectious period for measles) and on the standard 14-day aver - age incubation period for measles defined in national guidelines. Awareness raising in educational and healthcare settings Awareness of measles and the importance of exclusion from educational settings was increased among teach - ing staff, students and parents by sending 'warn and inform' letters via school management teams. These letters outlined the symptoms of measles, the need to seek medical assessment while being aware of the potential for transmission, measures to avoid onward transmission (including exclusion and voluntary isola - tion), and the importance of vaccination in primary pre - vention of measles. Raising awareness among clinicians of the infectiv - ity of measles and the importance of reducing risk of transmission to other patients by isolating suspected cases in healthcare settings was achieved proactively by sending a measles bulletin to clinicians, hospitals and local authorities, and reactively by notifying the relevant infection control teams about cases in their institution. When a cluster was identified, a local outbreak con - trol team was formed to manage it. Within the Health Protection Team, a measles strategy group with a nom - inated lead maintained an overview. Surveillance data were reviewed at least weekly. Reducing the pool of susceptible individuals Local measuresBoth proactive and reactive approaches were used to reduce the pool of susceptible individuals. Where probable or confirmed cases were notified, a complete course of MMR vaccine was advised for all under-immu - nised household contacts. Educational settings attended by confirmed or proba - ble cases were targeted. The approach used to increase MMR vaccine uptake varied from sending letters to par - ents encouraging them to take any under-vaccinated children to their GP for MMR vaccination, to specific school-based immunisation sessions. In school-based immunisations sessions, priority was given to immu - nising children who had received no MMR dose over those who were partially immunised. Local OCTs decided whether to offer MMR vaccine to children attending affected schools, via GPs or a school-based campaign depending on the level of sus - ceptibility within the setting, resources available to local public health teams, and on whether a previous school-based immunisation session had already taken place in the setting or not. In some areas, MMR vaccine was proactively offered in schools with a high number of susceptible children, especially where these schools had links to affected schools [17]. The risk of transmission between schools was highlighted early on by social network analysis (Figure 4). Early awareness and understanding of this potential for transmission allowed local teams to target 'feeder' primary schools (primary schools most likely to host younger siblings of cases in the secondary school) as sites for intervention. Proactive approaches included: supporting local public health teams in areas most affected by the outbreak to raise awareness of the measles outbreak, promoting MMR vaccination, and raising awareness of the impor - tance of immunity to measles among all clinical staff via a regular measles bulletin. National campaign In response to multiple outbreaks in different areas of England and a rise in numbers of cases nationally in 2012 and 2013, a national MMR catch-up vaccina - tion campaign [13] was launched in April 2013, with the aim of achieving a 95% uptake of one dose of MMR vaccine in 10-16 year-olds by September 2013. 25 www.eurosurveillance.orgNationally-set indicators were used to measure uptake, which included number of invitations sent and number of MMR vaccine doses ordered by primary care. The national MMR catch-up vaccination campaign was implemented in two phases. In Greater Manchester, in phase 1, primary care ser - vices were asked to actively identify under-immunised 10-16 year-olds using a variety of methods, includ - ing checking their own practices' electronic records [18], and to invite them for MMR vaccination using a method of their choice (usually a letter) and immunise them. GPs were remunerated for this service. Under-immunised 10-16 year-old children were defined as 10-16 year-old children who had received one dose or no dose of MMR vaccine. Priority was given to those who had received no dose of MMR vaccine. In phase 2, the focus in Greater Manchester was on schools with low uptake. School Health Services review immunisation status when the children enter primary or secondary school and when delivering other vaccinations such as human papillomavirus (HPV) vac - 10-16 year-olds under-immunised for measles identified in this way were offered a dose of MMR vaccine. The local impact of the national MMR catch-up vaccination campaignA total of 496 (98%) of General Practices in Greater Manchester participated in the catch-up vaccination campaign. Between May 2013 and October 2013, over 10,000 invitation letters were sent out and 947 doses of MMR vaccine were given by Greater Manchester primary care services taking part in the catch-up cam - paign. Phase 1 of the catch-up campaign ended in September 2013, and no further letters were sent out beyond this point. Further eligible children will have been identified and immunised during phase 2 of the campaign by school nurses. No further information on numbers of 10-16 year-olds identified or numbers of 10-16 year-olds immunised is currently available. An interim analysis of the impact of the catch-up cam - paign nationally has been recently published [19], which suggested achievement of the target of 95% of 10-16 year-olds having had at least one dose of MMR vaccine. Indirect impacts such as raising awareness of the risks of measles and the benefits of MMR vaccina - tion are likely to have had a positive impact. Discussion and conclusions The descriptive epidemiology of this outbreak was consistent with multiple introductions of measles into partially susceptible communities resulting in a series of discrete outbreaks rather than Greater Manchester wide transmission. Some local authorities had local - ised outbreaks, often amplified and maintained in educational settings, in particular secondary schools, reflecting known cohorts of low coverage. This was demonstrated by the social network diagrams and the age groups affected. The outbreak control team found social network analysis useful in the early phases of localised outbreaks associated with a particular setting to understand transmission patterns and enable prior - itisation of control measures. Other local authorities had only sporadic cases with no known link between them. This observed pattern may be partly the result of artefact, with contributing factors such as under-reporting of cases to the health protection team, and partly a reflection of different transmission patterns in different areas, with possible contributing factors including: different MMR vaccine uptake rates, differ - ence in potential for onward transmission (for exam - ple, cases who do not attend educational settings), differences in social networks and socialising behav - iours. This is in contrast to an earlier large outbreak in Merseyside (40 miles away from Greater Manchester), where the key transmission events were in healthcare settings [20]. Patterns of transmission differed between local author - ity areas. Two neighbouring areas with similar cur - rent MMR vaccine uptake levels experienced different transmission patterns: one had a localised secondary school-focused outbreak which was rapidly controlled with a proactive approach to increasing MMR vaccine uptake in the susceptible population; the other had a more widespread and longer outbreak associated with a variety of educational settings and family clusters, managed reactively. This may be due to the educa - tional systems within the areas (including catchment areas of the schools) or due to the outbreak manage - ment strategy. Northern areas of Greater Manchester reported more cases and outbreaks than southern areas. Although current uptake rates for MMR vaccine are high in many northern areas of Greater Manchester, historical uptake rates were not, and the estimated size of the suscep - tible population was higher in these areas. Absolute numbers of susceptible individuals rather than cur - rent vaccine uptake rates should be taken into account when prioritising areas for proactive control measures. In this outbreak, the genotype confirmed was D8, a different genotype to the recent large outbreak in the neighbouring area of Merseyside [15], and the same genotype but different strain to the recent large out - break in South Wales [20]. D8 strain has been identi - fied in other areas: an outbreak in North Wales, cases in Cheshire and a concurrent outbreak in the traveller community [16]. The different genotyping highlighted the limited transmission risks and social networks between the two neighbouring cities. Investigation of social settings was useful to track transmission and identify targets for intervention particularly in the early phases of the outbreak. The pictorial representation of the contextual settings along with its association with the case provided an 26 www.eurosurveillance.orgunderstanding of the progression of the spread of the disease and helped plan preventive actions. The sharp decrease in notification of cases in the sum - mer holidays (from the end of July to early September) supports the hypothesis that schools were the sites of transmission during this outbreak. The public health actions of note included: reducing likelihood of onward transmission by excluding sus - ceptible household contacts of cases from educational settings and reducing the size of the susceptible popu - lation by proactive MMR immunisation targeting high-risk educational settings. Increasing MMR vaccine uptake in target groups via GPs was carried out as part of different aspects of the outbreak response: as part of local outbreak manage - ment, on instruction from the local outbreak control team; and as part of the national MMR vaccination catch-up campaign; this was directed nationally and GPs only commenced systematic activity once the cam - paign was launched in late April 2013. Exclusion of unimmunised household contacts from educational settings was voluntary and informal. In the majority of cases, parents and schools agreed to this request but compliance with exclusion was not monitored. The importance of isolation of infectious individuals in controlling the spread of measles has been reported on previously [21], and anecdotal evidence from this outbreak suggests that excluding infectious cases and their susceptible household contacts from educational settings was one of the most effective measures in controlling local outbreaks. In the response to some local outbreaks, high-risk schools were identified usually based on social/edu - cational networks and levels of MMR vaccine uptake. These schools were then targeted proactively. This seemed to be associated with rapid control in some areas. Uptake in this scenario may be better than pro - active campaigns in the absence of an outbreak. This outbreak was not associated with specific hard- to-reach groups [22] but was in the wider population. Such outbreaks highlight the problem of cohorts of under-vaccinated children. If such outbreaks continue to occur, Europe will not achieve its goal of measles elimination by 2015 [23]. This paper describes the epidemiology and manage - ment of a prolonged outbreak of measles. Data were collected for case management purposes. Standard operating procedures evolved during the outbreak. Evaluation of individual control measures was not planned before the outbreak with resultant limitations. Children interact both inside and outside of school: it was impossible to separate secondary schools and the associated out-of-school social networks as sites of transmission. We have described a measles outbreak that pre - dominantly affected an under-immunised cohort of teenagers and young adults, with key transmission and amplification events associated with secondary schools. Of key importance for public health practice were the thorough investigation of outbreaks, devel - oping understanding of local transmission supported by the use of social network analysis, and the multi-facetted approach to control measures, with a bundle of public health measures (both reactive and proac - tive) focussing on the two key elements of improving MMR vaccine uptake in the susceptible population and excluding infectious cases from settings with a high potential for onwards transmission (such as secondary schools).

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20984 Article submitted on 18 June 2014 / published on 11 December 2014 Assessing the severity of emerging infections is chal - lenging because of potential biases in case ascertain - ment. The first human case of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus was identified in China in March 2013; since then, the virus has caused two epidemic waves in the country. There were 134 laboratory-confirmed cases detected in the first epidemic wave from January to September 2013. In the second epidemic wave of human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in China from October 2013 to October 2014, we esti - mated that the risk of death among hospitalised cases of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus was 48% (95% credibility interval: 42-54%), slightly higher than the corresponding risk in the first wave. Age-specific risks of death among hospitalised cases were also significantly higher in the second wave. Using data on symptomatic cases identified through national senti - nel influenza-like illness surveillance, we estimated that the risk of death among symptomatic cases of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus was 0.10% (95% credibility interval: 0.029-3.6%), which was simi - lar to previous estimates for the first epidemic wave of human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus in 2013. An increase in the risk of death among hospital - ised cases in the second wave could be real because of changes in the virus, because of seasonal changes in host susceptibility to severe infection, or because of variation in treatment practices between hospitals, while the increase could be artefactual because of changes in ascertainment of cases in different areas at different times. Introduction Since the first human case of infection with novel avian influenza A(H7N9) virus was identified in China in March 2013, there have been two major epidemic waves of human infections to date. The first epidemic wave, in the spring of 2013, waned during the late spring and summer [1-3], while a second major epidemic wave occurred during the winter of 2013/14 and had waned by the end of the spring of 2014 while sporadic cases have continued to be reported (as of 9 October 2014). A small number of clusters of laboratory-confirmed cases have been identified in both epidemic waves, but the virus has not appeared to have the capacity for sustained human-to-human transmission [1]. Confirmed cases of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus have generally been identified in hospitalised patients with pneumonia [4], however, a small num - ber of confirmed cases was identified through rou - tine sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance which indicates the possibility for a larger number of mild influenza A(H7N9) virus infections [5,6]. This has implications for determination of the clinical severity of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections, because the con - firmed cases may not fully reflect the clinical spectrum of infections, and consequently changes in case ascer - tainment could lead to artefactual variation in risk of severe outcomes. In previous work, we demonstrated that the case fatality risk among confirmed cases of infection with the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus was very heterogeneous and difficult to interpret [7], and we characterised the severity of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections via the risk of fatalities among hospitalised cases (the 'hospitalisation fatality risk', HFR) and the risk of fatalities among symptomatic cases (the 'symp - tomatic case fatality risk', CFR) [3]. In the first epidemic wave of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections in spring 2013, we estimated the HFR at 36%, and the CFR at 29 www.eurosurveillance.org0.16% to 2.8% [3]. The objective of the present study is to estimate the HFR and symptomatic CFR in the second epidemic wave, and to determine whether the severity of human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus has changed over time. Methods Sources of data All laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influ - enza A(H7N9) virus infection are reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) through a national surveillance system. Case defini - tions, surveillance for identification of cases, and laboratory assays have been previously described [1]. Demographic, epidemiological, and basic clinical data were obtained from each confirmed case with standard - ised forms. An integrated database was constructed by China CDC, with detailed epidemiological information about each confirmed case of infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus reported by 9 October 2014. We used information about age, sex, place of residence, dates of illness onset, hospital admission, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, death, and recovery or discharge. Statistical analysis Cases were determined to be hospitalised for medi - cal reasons (rather than solely for isolation purposes) based on routine clinical judgment, e.g. those present - ing with complications such as pneumonia. A small number of cases presenting with mild respiratory symptoms did not have any complications through - out the clinical course and were hospitalised only for the purpose of isolation. Among the confirmed cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection that were hos - pitalised for medical reasons, i.e. excluding these mild cases, we estimated the risks of ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and death. To allow for the uncertain outcomes of cases that remained in hospital on the date of analysis (9 October 2014), we used the method proposed by Garske et al., which inflates the observed fatality risk based on the time to death dis - tribution [8]. We constructed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a bootstrap approach with 1,000 resamples. To estimate the symptomatic CFR, we inferred the num - ber of symptomatic cases based on the detection of symptomatic cases through sentinel ILI surveillance in urban areas [3]. We searched for urban areas where (i) the number of confirmed A(H7N9) virus infection cases registered by local ILI sentinels and other hospitals are both larger than one, and (ii) the number of outpa - tient visits at local ILI sentinels and other hospitals is available. In the spring 2013 epidemic wave, Shanghai and Nanjing (Jiangsu province) met the criteria, and in the winter 2013/14 epidemic wave the city of Shaoxing (Zhejiang province) met the criteria. In these selected urban areas, we determined the daily number of all ILI cases reported and specimens tested by ILI surveillance in each location during the relevant period to infer the number of infected individuals who would have sought medical care at ILI sentinels (N ILI). We assumed that healthcare seeking behaviour of individuals with ILI associated with influenza A(H7N9) virus infection was the same as healthcare seeking behaviour of individu - als with ILI associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus infection in 2009/10 in the same area of China. We used data from a nationwide serosurvey and ILI surveillance of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pan - demic in China from June 2009 to January 2010, to esti - mate the proportion of individuals with symptomatic infections who sought medical care at ILI sentinels. We divided N ILI by this proportion. We then estimated the symptomatic CFR in each location using the number of confirmed deaths as the numerator and the estimated Figure 1 Incidence of laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection by date of hospitalisation, China, 1 February 2013-9 October 2014 The first wave of infections in 2013 is divided into two parts, before and after the announcement of human cases on 31 March 2013 because of the potential for under-ascertainment of less severe cases in the earlier period.Wave 1A Wave 1B Wave 2 1 Feb 13 1 May 13 1 Aug 13 1 Nov 13 1 Feb 14 1 May 14 1 Aug 14 9 Oct 140246810Number of cases Date30 www.eurosurveillance.orgnumber of mild cases as the denominator. We used a Bayesian framework to estimate the symptomatic CFR, and presented the estimates with 95% credibility inter - vals (CrI) which have a similar interpretation to confi - dence intervals [9]. We examined epidemiologic time-to-event distributions using kernel density methods as previously described [2]. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and Matlab (Mathworks Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States). Results In the first wave of influenza A(H7N9) cases in 2013, 134 confirmed cases were identified (Figure 1), of whom 124 required hospitalisation for medical reasons. Among the hospitalised cases, the risk of serious out - comes was higher among older hospitalised cases. Furthermore, we identified higher risks of fatalities among cases hospitalised before 31 March 2013, the date when the first confirmed human cases of influ - enza A(H7N9) virus infection were officially announced in China (Figure 2). We therefore divided the first wave into two parts: wave 1A for 18 cases hospitalised before 1 April 2013, and wave 1B for 106 cases hospitalised from 1 April to 30 September 2013 (Figure 1). In the first epidemic wave, the median age was 60 years in wave 1A and 61 years in wave 1B. Among the cases under 60 years who required hospitalisation for medical reasons, the HFR in wave 1A was 51% (95% CI: 21%-79%), 17% (95% CI: 7.6%-30%) in wave 1B. For cases above 60 years who required hospitalisation for medical rea - sons, the HFR was also significantly higher (p = 0.025) in wave - ferences between wave 1A and 1B in the risk of death or ventilation, or in the risk of death/ventilation/ICU admission (Figure 2). In the second epidemic wave of influenza A(H7N9), 273 of the 306 confirmed cases required hospitalisation for medical reasons with onset dates between 1 October 2013 and 9 October 2014. The median age was 57 years (range 2-88 years). Sixty-nine percent of cases were male. Among the hospitalised cases, allowing for censoring of outcomes in five (2%) patients remain in hospital on 9 October 2014, we estimated HFRs of 36% (95% CI: 28%-45%) and 59% (95% CI: 51%-67%) in cases aged 60 years or above. These risks were significantly higher than in wave 1B (p = 0.019 and p = 0.025 respectively). There were no statistically significant differences between the age-specific risks of death or ventilation, or death/ventila - tion/ICU admission in wave 2 compared to either wave 1A or wave 1B, while estimates of the risks of serious outcomes were generally lower across age groups in wave 1B compared with wave 2 (Figure 2). While the second epidemic wave occurred over a broader geo - graphic area than the first wave, Zhejiang province was heavily affected in both epidemic waves. We Figure 2 Estimates and 95% credibility intervals of the risk of serious outcomes among laboratory-confirmed human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) hospitalised for medical reasons, by age and wave, China, 1 February 2013-9 October 2014 Panel A: the risk of death. Panel B: the risk of death or mechanical ventilation. Panel C: the risk of death or mechanical ventilation or intensive care unit admission. Epidemic wave 1A: 1 February-31 March 2013 Epidemic wave 1B: 1 April-30 September 2013Epidemic wave 2: 1 %31 www.eurosurveillance.orgtherefore examined the risk of death among the sub - set of hospitalised cases in this province. Zhejiang province reported 40 cases in wave 1B and 88 cases in wave 2, and the risk of death among hospitalised cases under 60 years-old was significantly higher in wave 2 compared with wave 1B (risk ratio 7.1; 95% CI: 1.3-292; p = 0.017) and not significantly different in hospitalised cases above 60 years-old (risk ratio 1.5; 95% CI: 0.93-2.8; p = 0.099). We examined the delays from onset to admission and identified similar patterns over calendar time, while the delay from onset to laboratory confirmation has shortened over time and in wave 2 the mean was eight days (Figure 3). Distributions of time from admission to death and from admission to discharge were similar over time (Figure 3). We previously used information on three confirmed influenza A(H7N9) cases identified through ILI sur - veillance in Shanghai and Nanjing to estimate the number of symptomatic cases in the spring 2013 epi - demic wave [3]. Here we also use information on four confirmed cases identified through ILI surveillance in Shaoxing in the winter 2013/14 epidemic wave, in the period from 1 January to 21 January 2014, before the closure of live poultry markets on 22 January. During the same period in Shaoxing, nine hospitalised cases had onset of illness, of whom five died. Based on these observations, we estimated that there were 3,020 Figure 3 Comparisons of epidemiologic distributions between waves, human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9), China, 1 February 2013-9 October 2014 Wave 1A: 1 February-31 March 2013 Wave 1B: 1 April-30 September 2: October 10 200.000.050.100.150.20Wave 1A Wave 1B Wave 2DensityDays from illness onset to hospital admission A 0 10 200.000.050.100.150.20DensityDays from illness onset to conr mation B 0 10 20 30 400.000.050.10DensityDays from hospital admission to death C 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 700.000.05DensityDays from hospital admission to 5,310 (95% CI: 880-17,300) cases in the first epidemic wave in 2013 in Shanghai and Nanjing, respectively, and 5,750 (95% CI: 1,960-12,730) cases in Shaoxing in the second epidemic wave in 2013/14. These estimates correspond to symp - tomatic CFRs of 490 and 69 in Shanghai and Nanjing respectively in the first wave, and 100 per 100,000 symptomatic cases in Shaoxing in the second wave, with wide and overlapping credibility intervals (Table). Discussion The resurgence of human infections with avian influ - enza A(H7N9) virus in a second epidemic wave in 2013/14 demonstrates the continued public health risk of this novel strain [10]. Control of the virus in animals is complicated, because the infections in poultry are asymptomatic [11]. Human-to-human transmissibility of the virus remains limited, as evidenced by the very small number of potential secondary infections iden - tified through detailed contact tracing of confirmed cases [1,2,12-14]. We identified differences in the severity of illness of hospitalised cases in the earlier part of the first epi - demic wave in 2013, with greater risk of mechanical ventilation, ICU admission and death among cases hospitalised before 31 March 2013 when the first con - firmed human cases of influenza A(H7N9) were offi - cially announced (Figure 2) [15]. One explanation for this is more timely antiviral treatment and more appro - priate supportive care for cases hospitalised after 31 March 2013. Another possible explanation is detection bias in the early phase of the spring 2013 epidemic wave, where more severe cases were prioritised for repeated laboratory testing, and cases with prolonged virus shedding or higher virus shedding had a greater chance of confirmation. In the second epidemic wave in 2013/14, we identified a significantly greater HFR compared with the latter part of the first epidemic wave in 2013 (Figure 2) and in persons under 60 years of age in Zhejiang province where cases occurred in both epidemic waves, but no difference in the symptomatic CFR (Table). It is possible that this significant difference in HFRs is due to ascer - tainment bias in cases in different locations at different times, even within the same province. Alternatively, the HFR could have increased, because hospitalised cases in the second epidemic wave in 2013/14 were less likely to be transferred to larger referral hospitals (Dr Enfu Chen, Chief Epidemiologist in Zhejiang Provincial CDC, personal communication, June 2014), because of changes in the virus, or because of seasonal changes in the prevalence of other pathogens that could cause secondary or co-infections and modify the severity of influenza A(H7N9) virus infections [16]. Whereas ascertainment of infections in hospitalised cases may have changed over time due to changes in awareness and testing capacity, the ascertainment of influenza A(H7N9) cases through the established sentinel ILI net - work should have remained more stable over time. Large population-based serological studies in affected areas would permit assessment of severity with a denominator of infections, rather than cases of symp - tomatic disease or hospitalisation, and infection-based severity measures could be less susceptible to biases due to differential healthcare seeking behaviours or diagnostic capacity [3,7]. To date, few serological stud - ies have been reported and such analyses are not yet possible [17-19]. Our estimates of the risks of serious outcomes in hospitalised cases are limited by the potential for under-ascertainment of cases, due to lack of access to laboratory testing in some areas, and the potential for imperfect sensitivity of laboratory testing for the A(H7N9) virus [20,21]. While we accounted for unknown final status of cases that remain hospitalised in our analysis, the eventual estimates may change slightly once all outcomes are known. It is challenging to esti - mate the symptomatic CFR based on a small number of confirmed cases with milder disease identified through sentinel ILI surveillance, and our estimates are dependent on the assumptions that coverage of the sentinel system was similar in 2013/14 compared with 2009, and that healthcare seeking behaviours for ILI were similar whether illness was caused by influenza Table Estimates of the symptomatic case fatality risk, human cases of influenza A(H7N9) virus infection, China, 1 January 2013-21 January 2014 Period analysed Geographic locationNumber of confirmed deaths caused by influenza A(H7N9) virus infectionEstimated number of symptomatic A(H7N9) virus infectionsEstimated risk of fatalities per 100,000 symptomatic cases 1 Jan 2013-28 May 2013 Shanghai 14 3,020 CI: 170-1,800) the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus [3]. In addition, the estimation of sCFR were based on data from geographic locations in which influenza A(H7N9) virus infections were identified through senti - nel ILI surveillance, and a more comprehensive analy - sis could also incorporate data on ILI surveillance in other areas. In conclusion, it remains important to assess the sever - ity of human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus, as part of ongoing risk assessment of this virus. While the overall picture is that the severity of human infec - tions has not substantially changed (Table), we found some evidence that the HFR was higher in the second epidemic wave in 2013/14 (Figure 2). Our results again highlight that many influenza A(H7N9) virus infections can cause mild disease [3,5,6] and that the risk of death among laboratory-confirmed cases is a mislead - ing measure of severity. If another epidemic of human infections with influenza A(H7N9) virus occurs in the winter of 2014/15, proactive control measures on the poultry-human interface may be preferable to reactive measures [10,22-24]. Comprehensive surveillance of avian influenza virus infections in animals and humans is essential in order to monitor risk and guide the use of control measures.

The dynamic changes of dominant clones of Staphylococcus aureus causing bloodstream infections in the European region: Results of a second structured survey . Euro Surveill. 2014;19(49):pii=20987. Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20987 Article submitted on 19 February 2014 / published on 11 December 2014 Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important human pathogens and meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) presents a major cause of healthcare- and community-acquired infections. This study investi - gated the spatial and temporal changes of S. aureus causing bacteraemia in Europe over a five-year interval and explored the possibility of integrating pathogen-based typing data with epidemiological and clinical information at a European level. Between January 2011 and July 2011, 350 laboratories serving 453 hospitals in 25 countries collected 3,753 isolates (meticillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA) from patients with S. aureus bloodstream infections. All isolates were sent to the national staphylococcal reference laboratories and characterised by quality-controlled spa typing. Data were uploaded to an interactive web- based mapping tool. A wide geographical distribu - tion of spa types was found, with some prevalent in all European countries. MSSA was more diverse than MRSA. MRSA differed considerably between countries with major international clones expanding or receding when compared to a 2006 survey. We provide evidence that a network approach of decentralised typing and visualisation of aggregated data using an interactive mapping tool can provide important information on the dynamics of S. aureus populations such as early signalling of emerging strains, cross-border spread and importation by travel. Introduction Staphylococcus aureus is one of the major causes of bacterial infection in humans [1]. Infections occur in the community or in healthcare settings, predominantly following acquisition from mainly human sources. In Europe, meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) are pre - dominantly acquired in healthcare settings and rep - resent a major challenge to the control of antibiotic resistance in hospitals. MRSA has therefore become the currency with which the success of infection con - trol initiatives is measured at health systems level [2]. S. aureus can also acquire particular virulence traits and has been responsible for major outbreaks of toxin-mediated disease in the community [3]. At the same time, S. aureus evolves gradually by successive acqui - sition of syntenic changes of largely unaltered core genomes. It is therefore possible to describe transmis - sion and the consecutive spread of bacteria by genetic characterisation of highly polymorphic sites within the core genes of all isolates [4]. The importance of S. aureus as a human pathogen, i.e. its potential to cause large-scale outbreaks in healthcare settings and in the community, and its predominantly clonal population structure, calls for a monitoring tool that scans the distribution and spread of clones of particu - lar public health importance over larger temporal and spatial intervals through repeated surveys. Such a tool is suited to inform public health and infection control personnel of impeding health threats. We therefore continued with a Europe-wide initiative to explore and define any dynamic changes in the distri - bution and spread of clones of S. aureus in European hospitals five years after an initial survey was carried out in 2006 [5]. We also addressed a request from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) to explore the usefulness of integration of molecular typing data with epidemiological and clini - cal data at a European level.36 www.eurosurveillance.orgMethods spa typing Molecular typing for epidemiological purposes utilises highly discriminatory genetic markers that character - ise human pathogens allowing the identification of isolates that are distinct versus those that are closely related due to recent common ancestry. The spa locus of S. aureus codes for Protein A, a species-specific gene product known for its IgG binding capacity. This locus is highly polymorphic due to an internal variable region of short tandem repeats which vary not only in number but also due to nucleotide substitutions within individual repeat units [6]. DNA sequences of the spa gene therefore provide portable and biologically mean - ingful molecular typing data that have demonstrated their utility for macro- and micro-epidemiological pur - poses from surveillance through to outbreak investiga - tions at various geographical levels [7,8]. Capacity building During annually repeated workshops organised for technical personnel from European Staphylococcal Reference Laboratories (SRL), participants receive hands-on training in spa typing and data analysis according to a standard protocol using a purpose-designed software tool StaphType (Ridom GmbH, W\u00fcrzburg, Germany) [8]. Proficiency testing was car - ried out by mailing each SRL five well-characterised S. aureus isolates and five sequence chromatograms (trace files) of known spa types as described previously [9,10]. All laboratories participating in the structured survey described here fulfilled quantifiable quality cri - teria which consisted of an unambiguous base-calling for all sequenced nucleotides for both forward and reverse sequencing runs of the test panel. Structured survey A protocol was agreed by all participating SRLs in June 2010. Using the same network of sentinel labo - ratories, this by and large followed the sampling frame deployed of the first structured survey carried out in 2006 [5]. Briefly, European SRLs were asked to approach sentinel hospital laboratories which already participated in the previous survey and which provide microbiological diagnostic services for a geo-demo - graphically representative sample for their national patient population. Between January and July 2011, these laboratories were asked to submit the first five consecutive MSSA and MRSA isolates from individual patients with blood stream infection, from each hos - pital the laboratories served. If, due to low incidence, five MRSA isolates could not be obtained within these six months, laboratories were entitled to make up their quota of 10 isolates by submitting additional MSSA isolates. For small countries with only one laboratory, such as Cyprus and Malta, more than 10 samples were accepted within this sampling period. Isolates were dispatched by the participating laboratories to the SRLs and, whenever possible, accompanied by addi - tional information, including sample number, date of isolation, demographic details (such as age and sex), epidemiological context (hospital-acquired if disease onset was more than 48 hours after admission, or community-onset for other cases), antibiotic resist - ance to isoxazolylpenicillin oxacillin) or cefoxitin. SRLs or inhibitory concentration for oxacillin together with PBP2a agglutination. Discrepancies between gen - otype or agglutination assay and susceptibility test were scored as inconclusive phenotypes. Additional information could be uploaded to the database and web application if available. This consisted of all-cause mortality 14 days after isolation of the initial blood - stream isolate. All SRLs preserved the isolates in strain collections and performed spa typing according to the standard protocol, uploaded the sequence information and made this available by synchronisation with the central Ridom SpaServer (www.spaserver.ridom.de) curated by SeqNet.org at the University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands [10,11]. Currently there are more than 13,000 spa -types and 630 repeat units stored on the SpaServer. Epidemiological and typing data were communicated in parallel to a central purpose-designed structured query language (SQL) database at the Netherlands' National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM). For each local laboratory, SRLs also provided the postal address and decimal Cartesian coordinates for auto - matic geolocation. All data were anonymised and col - lected in accordance with the European Parliament and Council decision for the epidemiological surveillance and control of communicable disease in the European community [12,13]. Ethical approval and informed con - sent were thus not required. Data analysis and geographical illustration All data were inspected for inconsistencies and ana - lysed on a country-by-country basis and returned to SRLs for feedback, clarification of inconsistencies and final approval in July 2012. After final approval, data were analysed using Stata version 11.0 (College Station, Texas, USA) using Pearson chi-squared test and Fischer's exact test for proportions and Student t-test for continuous variables. Quantitative differences with the 2006 survey were reported as results. The index of diversity (ID) is an unbiased measure of the probability of drawing two different spa types given the distribu - tion of spa types in the sample. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated as described previously [14]. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence types were extrapolated from the spa type as per the Ridom SpaServer. Cartesian coordinates were used for geolocation and plotting on Google Maps using the geocoding facility at www.spatialepidemiology.net [15]. The web application SRL-Maps (http://www.spatialepidemiology.net/SRL-Maps2) was developed to interrogate the data based on mapping of laboratory locations.37 www.eurosurveillance.orgResults Summary statistics Between January and July 2011, laboratories from 25 European countries participated in this survey. These included 22 European Union (EU) Member States (Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom), two European Economic Area (EEA) countries (Iceland and Norway) and Switzerland. For the United Kingdom, Scotland participated on its own behalf, whereas England, Northern Ireland and Wales all referred isolates to the same reference centre in England. Two countries (Cyprus and Malta) took the deliber - ate decision to carry out the necessary investigations in partner (twinning) laboratories, as the sample vol - ume would not otherwise have justified the necessary investment for sequencing equipment. Since they were also allowed to submit a larger quota, they submitted 34 and 20 isolates respectively. Altogether, 350 laboratories (Figure 1) serving 453 hos - pitals submitted data for 3,753 S. aureus isolates from patients with bloodstream infections, isolated dur - ing the six-month investigation period. Table 1 gives a summary overview of the number of participating Figure 1 Geographical location of laboratories that contributed to survey of meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and meticillin- resistant S. aureus isolates, 2011 38 www.eurosurveillance.orglaboratories and hospitals, isolates and spa types sub - mitted by country. The combined collection consisted of 2,621 (69%) MSSA and 1,130 (31%) MRSA. Two iso an inconclusive resistance phenotype. One was spa-type t127 and the other spa non-typable. A total of 861 different spa types were discerned, of which 720 were MSSA and 228 MRSA. Of these, 87 spa types were shared between MSSA and MRSA. When compared with results obtained during 2006, the spa type per isolate ratio remained at 0.23, indicating a similar sample diversity in both surveys. There were 51 isolates (out of a total of 3,753; 1.4%) which were spa non-typable. Typability of isolates ranged from 93.3% to 100% depending on the country.Bloodstream infections with S. aureus occurred at an older age (median 68 years, Table 2) and predominantly in men, which is in accordance with previous findings [5,16]. The proportion of isolates from men was higher among MRSA than MSSA bloodstream infections (p=0.03). The median age at infection with MRSA was three years older than for infection with with MSSA. Compared with 2006 data, the age distribution for both MSSA and MRSA in 2011 had shifted slightly to older age groups (p<0.001). In 2011, data on all-cause mortality 14 days after index blood culture were available for 65.5% of all cases. Overall all-cause mortality was 19.4% (477/2,458).

This difference was also identi - fied in 2006 and is explained by various confounders that put MRSA patients at a higher risk of dying than those with MSSA infections [17]. Overall, there were more patient deaths in 2011 compared with the 2006 survey (16%, p=0.004). Although observed for both MSSA and MRSA infections, this trend was only sig - nificant for MRSA infection (p=0.004). Whether this difference indicates an evolution towards more viru - lence or changes in host factors such as the increase in age is something that cannot be determined from this dataset. Disease onset occurred in the community for 56% of MSSA and 33.4% of MRSA infections, indicating that MRSA remains predominantly hospital-acquired. But there was a significant increase in the proportion of cases with community onset compared with the pre - vious survey (in 2006 48.4% of MSSA infections had community onset, p<0.001; for MRSA in the same year it was 28.3%, p=0.02). A comparison of the most prevalent spa types among hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) and community-onset isolates (CO-MRSA) revealed little difference (not shown). In the 2011 sam - ple, the five top ranking spa types comprised 52% and 45% of all HA-MRSA and CO-MRSA respectively. The high overall diversity (ID=0.985) is indicative of the good discriminatory ability of spa typing but, as with the 2006 sample, there has been a significant differ - ence between MSSA and MRSA as a result of the oligo-clonal nature of MRSA spreading through European countries. Overall distribution of spa types For MSSA, the top 20 ranking spa types included 43.2% of all MSSA isolates (Table 3). Importantly, there was very little difference among the first 11 ranking spa types between the 2011 and 2006 datasets. Only changes in rank order were observed. Ranks 12 to 20 contained four new spa types in 2011 (Table 3).Table 3 The 20 most frequent spa types and multilocus sequence typing types among meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and meticillin-resistant S. aureus isolates collected in 25 European countries in 2011 MSSA MRSA 99 8.8 3 t002 ST5 121 4.6 3 t008 ST8 95 8.4 4 t015 ST45 98 t002 ST5 87 7.7 5 t008 ST8 97 t067 ST125 50 4.4 6 t012 ST30 90 3.4 6 t041 ST228 24 2.1 49.3 7 t127 ST1 83 3.2 28.7 7 t777 ST5 21 1.9 51.2 8 t021 ST30 50 1.9 30.6 8 t018 ST36 20 1.8 9 t065 ST45 38 t022 t230 t747 ST22 17 1.5 13 t216 ST59 28 t044 t056 t148 t024 ST8 14 1.2 16 t024 ST8 23 t740 ST45 12 1.1 17 t346 ST15 23 t515 ST22 12 1.1 18 t571 ST398 23 0.9 18 t6057 ST22 11 1.0 19 t701 ST8 23 t030 ST239 9 t189 0.8 43.2 20 t014 ST225 9 0.8 68.1 Other - - 1,489 56.8 100.0 other - - 361 31.9 100.0 a Predicted from spa typing data.41 www.eurosurveillance.orgFor MRSA, the top 20 ranking MRSA spa types contained 68.1% of all MRSA isolates (73.4% in 2006). There were no differences in the top six spa types (albeit in relative ranking). t032/ST22 now comprises 17.9% of all MRSA sampled in 2011 (up from 14.5% in 2006, p=0.036, Figure 2, Table 3). Except for t515, all ST22 related spa types (t032, t022, t747, t2357, t6057) have significantly increased in frequency and this lineage made up 36% of the top 20 ranking isolates in 2011, whereas in 2006 this figure was still lower at 23%. Three spa types have significantly decreased compared to the 2006 collec - tion. t008/ST8, mainly found in France, decreased from 12.4% to 8.4% (p=0.003). t041/ST228 decreased from 7.4% in 2.1% 2011 (p<0.001). Finally, international clone t030/ST239 decreased from 2.1% to 0.8% (p=0.013). Discussion This survey represents a repetition of a previous study carried out in 2006 and was designed to investigate (i) the temporal and spatial changes of S. aureus clones of particular public health importance in Europe, and (ii) the feasibility and utility of integrating molecular typ - ing data with epidemiological and clinical information at a European level. We previously demonstrated the feasibility of creating a collaborative consortium of SRLs across Europe and alignment of S. aureus typing methodology in addition to harmonising processes and data format at European level [5]. The continuation of this effort has shown that collaboration between countries can be maintained over extended intervals and provide added value to the understanding of the dynamic spread of S. aureus while quality, consistency of molecular typing and communication improves. The results described here are testimony to the useful - ness of structured surveys to generate information for public health action in a timely and economic fashion. Repeating surveys through previously created networks of sentinel hospital laboratories allows for consist - ent observations about the changing epidemiology of infections caused by bacterial clones of particular pub - lic health importance. In case of S. aureus , these clones are responsible for community and hospital-acquired infections, and they are often resistant to a range of antibiotic compounds and circulate among patients of extended hospital referral networks in Europe. They typically have a defined geographical distribution and show a steady diffusion along hospital patient referral lines. Moreover, our results suggest that HA-MRSA is filtering into the community at an increasing rate. The proportion of community-onset infections caused by international HA-MRSA clones has increased over the last five years from 28.3% to 33.4%. This difference is significant (p<0.001) and relevant as it indicates a trend to more export of hospital-associated clones Figure 2 Comparison of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus spa -type frequencies, 2011 and 2006 Brackets over the bars indicate the bars for which p values community, probably as a result of patients' shorter hospital stays. Among MRSA isolates, a dynamic expansion was dem - onstrated for several spa types. MRSA isolates with spa types belonging to ST22 increased most markedly making ST22 the most critically expanding MRSA clone in Europe. This lineage (designated EMRSA-15) was first described during hospital outbreaks in England. It caused a nationwide epidemic of healthcare-associ - ated infections in the 1990s and is still the most prev - alent HA-MRSA in the UK [18]. This clone has spread from the UK and Ireland and has become abundant in Germany, Hungary, Portugal and Northern Italy. MRSA belonging to spa type t018/ST36 has attained a foot - hold in Poland and t067/ST125, abundant in Spain dur - ing the 2006 survey [19], has been causing an outbreak in hospitals in a single health district in Finland in 2011 [20]. Among MSSA, spa type t571/ST398 appears to be spreading in France and Belgium [21]. Our observa - tions indicate that infections with this clone are more frequent among younger men and may be associated with higher mortality. Its MRSA counterpart has been described as an ancestral human variant [22] of the livestock-associated MRSA clone ST398, which caused outbreaks of community-acquired infections in north - ern Manhattan that were linked to immigrants from the Dominican Republic [23]. Conversely, a reduction of international clone ST239 consisting of the spa types t030 and t037 and t041/ST228 was observed. It appears that the decline of ST239 is genuine as it mainly occurred in Poland, whereas the reduction of t041/ST228 can be explained by the fact that Austria and Croatia did not participate in the 2011 survey. Both countries contributed a high proportion of this type to the 2006 dataset. This highlights the importance of consistent participation in these types of pathogen-specific surveillance initiatives and the vulnerability of networks that depend on the goodwill and enthusiasm of participants. Limitations of this study that deserve to be addressed include a deliberate decision that was taken by the SRLs to provide only isolates from bloodstream infec - tions. This slight deviation from the sampling frame of the previous survey may have skewed the spa type distribution slightly. Moreover, the fixed number of iso - lates that were collected from each participating centre was due to the trade-off between the desire to make the workload of SRLs predictable and manageable and the inability to precisely determine incidence and the absolute increase or decrease of spa types. Thus, find - ings generated through these types of structured sur - veys must be put into context of surveillance data from other European-wide initiatives such as the European Respiratory Society's (ERS-net) and/or the Healthcare-Associated Infections Surveillance Network (HAI-net). The nature of structured surveys does not allow for early warning and response as it merely provides a rather static population snapshot of the spa types, i.e. clones that were extant and caused bloodstream infections at the time of sampling. The value of these snapshots should not be underestimated, however, as they provide an unbiased view which can be used to identify clones of public health importance and their geographic abundance and can inform ad hoc epidemi - ological investigations about the dignity and geograph - ical origin of organisms isolated during outbreaks. The exchange of typing results using an illustrative mapping tool such as the spatialepidemiology.net website's SRL-maps provides the means to determine the reach and expansion of clones with proven suc - cess simultaneously for different countries. Initiatives such as these could lead to an improved and sustain - able effort to control and eradicate emerging high-risk clones at the level of healthcare institutions once inter - national agencies secure the sustainability for these repeated efforts. A consistent integration of typing data with pre-exist - ing epidemiological and or clinical data collected through other European surveillance initiatives (such as the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-net), European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network (ESAC-net) or HAI-net) will, depend on the successful implementation of further alignment of sampling methodology, diagnos - tic procedures and of the regulatory framework across Europe. It would require a systematic and internation - ally accepted identification-code for hospitals and diagnostic laboratories, as well as for bacterial iso - lates, which are reported through different surveillance initiatives and for patients from whom these organ - isms were originally recovered. This would require novel regulatory approaches on the part of European national governments. Moreover, data protection and confidentiality issues would need to be resolved before such regulations could be enacted. The alter - native would be a fully decentralised approach. This would require additional efforts from hospitals and laboratories to provide pertinent epidemiological and clinical information in addition to molecular typing and antibiotic susceptibility data and to report this bun - dled information while maintaining full confidentiality. However, as such efforts require a considerable degree of reorganisation they may seem unrealistic under the current climate of austerity. During the deliberations with the representatives of the SRLs in our study , the possibility of collecting more accurate data about source patients (epidemiology and clinical outcome) was appraised. The prevailing consensus was that this would be unrealistic given the scarcity of information provided to diagnostic laboratories by clinicians on the request forms and the inability of laboratories to fund these additional enquiries from their own budgets. It is important to note that these concerns were not raised by single members of the SRL working group, but appear to represent a common view. In conclusion, collaborative typing initiatives are able to identify the continental spread of high-risk clones 43 www.eurosurveillance.orgacross national boundaries and can indicate to health - care providers the emergence of threats caused by successful and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The geo - graphic diffusion of antibiotic-susceptible and resist - ant clones of S. aureus can be made visible with the help of intuitive information tools such as interactive websites. This can improve the coherence of individual laboratory results and contribute to a better under - standing of the population dynamic of these important pathogens. A simple integration of typing data with data from other existing surveillance efforts is, how - ever, currently constrained by regulatory hurdles and legitimate concerns about patient data protection.

Available online: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20985 Article submitted on 19 November 2013 / published on 11 December 2014 The harmonisation of training programmes for infec - tion control and hospital hygiene (IC/HH) professionals in Europe is a requirement of the Council recommenda - tion on patient safety. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control commissioned the 'Training Infection Control in Europe' project to develop a con - sensus on core competencies for IC/HH professionals in the European Union (EU). Core competencies were drafted on the basis of the Improving Patient Safety in Europe (IPSE) project's core curriculum (CC), eval - uated by questionnaire and approved by National Representatives (NRs) for IC/HH training. NRs also re-assessed the status of IC/HH training in European countries in 2010 in comparison with the situation before the IPSE CC in 2006. The IPSE CC had been used to develop or update 28 of 51 IC/HH courses. Only 10 of 33 countries offered training and qualification for IC/HH doctors and nurses. The proposed core competen - cies are structured in four areas and 16 professional tasks at junior and senior level. They form a reference for standardisation of IC/HH professional competen - cies and support recognition of training initiatives. Introduction There has been an increase in prevention and control activities in the field of infection control and hospital hygiene (IC/HH) in recent years owing to an increased awareness of patient safety and the considerable burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) [1]. While this strengthens the role of IC/HH professionals [2], the process has not always been accompanied by a commensurate increase in the resources for IC/HH pre - vention and control [3]. Many reports have documented a shortage of qualified IC/HH doctors and IC/HH nurses [4-7], and there are large differences among European countries in the qualifications required to work as an IC/HH professional [8]. The need to guarantee health - care quality standards throughout Europe, including for IC/HH, has been further stressed by the approval of the European Union (EU) directive on cross-border patient mobility [9]. In addition, topics such as patient safety, quality improvement, continuing professional develop - ment and risk management have become increasingly important and should be part of the content of contem - porary IC/HH training programmes [2,10-12]. In 2006, a European survey organised by the Improving Patient Safety in Europe (IPSE) project [8] indicated a lack of national IC/HH training programmes and of professional profiles for IC/HH practitioners in many European countries. Experts from the IPSE project and representatives of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) sub - sequently developed a European core curriculum for training of IC/HH professionals across Europe [8].46 www.eurosurveillance.orgIn July 2008, at the end of the IPSE project, its activi - ties were transferred to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in Stockholm. In 2009, considering the importance of continued support to national IC/HH training programmes and the opportunity to build further on the outputs of IPSE, ECDC issued an open call for tender (i) to evalu - ate the use of the European core curriculum devel - oped by IPSE in European countries and reassess the needs for IC/HH training in these countries, (ii) to set up a network for IC/HH training, and (iii) to pro - pose a strategy for further support to IC/HH train - ing in EU/EEA Member States (publication reference OJ/2009/06/16-PROC/2009/027). The contract was awarded to the Training in Infection Control in Europe (TRICE) project under the coordina - tion of the University of Udine, Italy. The TRICE project explored the state of the art of training IC/HH profes - sionals in Europe, evaluated the European core curricu - lum together with experts from participating countries, and proposed an agreed list of core competencies to guide the standardisation of training of European IC/HH professionals [13]. The aim of this paper is to report the evolution of the status of European IC/HH activities and practitioners between 2006 and 2010 and the finalisation of the agreed European IC/HH core competencies. Methods The TRICE project was carried out between January and September 2010 and had two stages: a questionnaire-based survey, followed by a face-to-face consultation. Member States of the EU, the European Economic Area (EEA) and EU candidate countries were invited by ECDC to participate and were asked to designate a national representative (NR) specifically for the project. The NR who responded to the questionnaire were nomi - nated by the governments of each country. They were either doctors or nurses and chosen according to a profile defined by ECDC, as part of the project. In this profile it was clearly explained that the NRs had to con - tribute to the survey reporting the national state of the art on the topic and that they were to interact with all relevant infection control leads and other appropriate professionals in their country. The 30 countries (33 respondents) included all EU Member States (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia (at the time a candidate country), Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK) (England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales provided separate answers), one EEA country (Norway) and one EU candidate countries (Turkey). The IPSE 2006 survey lacked the participation of Cyprus, Greece, and Romania.NRs had to be national experts on IC/HH, as they were required to document their national situations, collect data, complete questionnaires, and comment upon and approve TRICE documents. However, only nine of the 33 respondents were the same person as the one who had completed the IPSE 2006 questionnaire. For this rea - son, NRs were asked to validate data with other profes - sionals in their country before returning the completed TRICE questionnaire. To facilitate this process, answers to the 2006 IPSE questionnaire were sent to the NRs together with the TRICE questionnaire. NRs were asked to contact, in case of need, IC/HH training coordinators in their country to ensure that replies were representa - tive for the country. Development of the core competencies for IC/HH professionals in the EU comprised the following activities: Re-assessment by questionnaire of the existence of national programmes and courses for IC/HH train - ing and of the current status and profile of IC/HH professionals. Countries were asked, where possi - ble, to compare their situation in 2010 with that in 2006 (as evaluated by the IPSE project); Submission to the NRs of the European core curricu - lum for training of IC/HH practitioners developed by IPSE, together with a proposal for stratifying the core competencies in the curriculum into differ - ent levels of expertise (essential, intermediate and advanced level); Discussion through working groups and final gen - eral consensus of results and views at a meeting of NRs on 21 to 22 June 2010 in Udine (Italy); valida - tion and approval by all the NRs and meeting par - ticipants of a draft of these results and views; Development of a final document on these core com - petencies, approved by the NRs. As European countries have several different defini - tions, interpretations and reference frameworks rel - evant to competencies, the term 'competency', agreed by NRs, was defined as: 'the proven ability to use knowledge, skills and personal, social and/or meth - odological abilities, in work or study situations and in professional and personal development' [14]. The questionnaire was based on the previous IPSE project. It included instructions on how to fill in the responses, definitions of terms and relevant references to the IPSE project. Possible misinterpretations of the questions were addressed during data validation at a meeting of the NRs in June 2010. A pilot study was performed before launching the questionnaire. All data were individually validated by NRs twice before finalis - ing the analysis, first to confirm that the questionnaire had been filled in and the answers had been discussed at the workshop meeting and again for the draft of the final report including tables and figures.47 www.eurosurveillance.orgData from the IPSE 2006 and the TRICE 2010 surveys were entered in a database and analysed with SPSS version 11 (IBM SPSS Statistics New York, United States). Data were compared with the chi-squared test accepting a value of p 0.05 as statistical significant. To compare the ranking of the tasks performed by IC/HH professionals between the two surveys by degree of responsibility (responsible or contributor), we calcu - lated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results From 2006 to 2010, the number of countries with a national curriculum or programme for IC/HH training of doctors and nurses increased from 10 of 31 responding countries to 19 of 33 responding countries for doctors (Figure 1A and B), and from 17 of 31 to 21 of 33 coun - tries for nurses (Figure 1C and D).For IC/HH nurses, continuous training by professional bodies was required in 11 of 33 countries, a univer - sity degree in eight countries and IC/HH specialty was required in 10 countries for nurses to play a leading role in IC/HH. From 2006 to 2010, there was a slight increase in the number of universities taking a lead - ing role in IC/HH training both for doctors and nurses (Table 1). More than two thirds (22/30) of European countries reported that at least one training course was avail - able for IC/HH professionals, with 51 courses reported in total. Twenty-three of the 51 courses were run every year, six were run every second year, and for the remaining courses the frequency was not reported. Courses provided a post-graduate diploma (where the country recognises this title for professionals) for 25 of Figure 1 Presence of a national curriculum or programme for training of infection control and hospital hygiene doctors and nurses in European countries, 2006 (IPSE; 31 countries) and 2010 (TRICE; 33 countries) Luxembour gNon- visible countriesA.

Thirteen courses did not report a formal recognition. Nineteen of the 51 courses were recognised by the Ministry of Health and/or a State Agency, 23 by universities, and four by professional chambers (this list includes eight courses that are recognised by two institutions). The duration of the training was 100 hours or less in eight courses; 101 to 200 hours in six courses, 201 to 300 hours in 15 courses, 300 hours or more in eight courses, and one or more years in 13 courses, one course did not report the duration. Remarkably, 28 training courses reported in 2010 that they had considered the European core curriculum developed by the IPSE project and three of these courses provided distance learning programmes (Figure 2). The questionnaire also explored the professional sta - tus of IC/HH doctors and IC/HH nurses (Table 2) with respect to the presence of a job description, profes - sional profile definition and official recognition of an IC/HH degree. For IC/HH doctors, there was a slight increase in the percentage of countries reporting a job description from 11 of 31 in 2006 to 17 of 33 countries in 2010 (p = 0.20) and a significant increase in the per - centage of countries that provided a professional pro - file definition from 18 of 31 countries in 2006 to 28 of 33 countries in 2010 (p < 0.05). However, the official rec - ognition of the IC/HH degree did not increase between 2006 and 2010 and remained low at 16 of 33 countries for doctors and 19 of 33 for nurses (Table 2). IC/HH teams were defined within a national programme or regulation in 27 of 33 countries in 2010, compared with 21 of 31 countries in 2006. IC/HH doctors and IC/HH nurses were confirmed as the most represented professionals in the IC/HH team (Table 3).The initial specialisation (educational background) of IC/HH doctors was mostly microbiology, reported by 28 of 33 countries in 2010, followed by infectious dis - eases in 17, epidemiology in 11, public health in nine and hygiene in seven of the 33 countries. The most frequently reported initial specialisation for registered nurses before IC/HH specialisation for nurses was graduated/certified nurse in 28 of 33 coun - tries, followed by intensive care nurse in six, operat - ing theatre nurse in six, anaesthesiology nurse in three and other specialised nursing background in five coun - tries. The level of seniority required to become an IC/HH nurse was a minimum of three year of experience after qualification in 22 of the 33 countries, followed by being a senior head nurse in 10 countries.Table 2 Characteristics of the professional status (job description, professional profile and official recognition) of infection control/ hospital hygiene doctors and nurses in European countries, 2006 (IPSE; 31 countries) and 2010 (TRICE; 33 countries) Characteristics of professional statusNumber (percentage) of countries with characteristics for IC/HH doctors IC/HH nurses 2006 (n=31) 2010 (n=33) 2006 (n=31) 2010 (n=33) Presence of job description 11 (36%) 17 (52%) 19 (61%) 23 (70%) Presence of a professional profile definition 18 (58%) 28 (85%) 22 (71%) 27 (82%) Presence of official recognition by the degree of IC/HH for doctors and nurses (any)a 13 (42%) 16 (49%) 20 (65%) 19 (58%) Official recognition by health care authorities 10 (32%) 11 (33%) 18 (58%) 14 (42%) Official recognition by universities 2 (7%) 4 (12%) 3 (10%) 5 (15%) Official recognition by professional bodies 4 (13%) 8 (24%) 7 (23%) 8 (24%) IC/HH: infection control hospital hygiene; IPSE: Improving Patient Safety in Europe; TRICE: Training needs assessment in Infection Control in Europe.

The most frequently reported tasks or areas of responsibility for IC/HH doc - tors in 2010 were: outbreak identification and investi - gation, analysis and feedback of IC/HH data and the development of an IC/HH programme and work plan (Table 4). The most frequently reported tasks or areas of respon - sibility for IC/HH nurses in 2010 were: training of hospital employees in IC/HH and the elaboration and implementation of IC/HH procedures (Table 5). Although some significant differences in the individual tasks existed between 2006 and 2010, there was a strong correlation of the ranking of tasks by degree of responsibility (responsible or contributor) between the two surveys (Spearman's correlation coefficient 0.78, p < 0.001). Besides the traditionally recognised tasks for IC/HH doctors and nurses, it appeared that the discipline of IC/HH was expanding, with the inclusion of new com - ponents such as quality and risk management. Evaluation and finalisation of the core competencies The results of the evaluation of the IPSE core compe - tencies were discussed at a meeting of the NRs in June 2010. During this meeting, some changes to the IPSE core competencies were agreed and it was decided to recommend only two categories because the interme - diate-level category (see Methods) was used by the NRs less frequently than the two other categories when evaluating individual competencies and was consid - ered too complex. Hence, two main levels of practice for IC/HH training and professional development were agreed as follows: Introductory level (junior specialist): newly appointed IC/HH staff member with little or no previous experience;Expert level (senior specialist): IC/HH professionals who are confident and experienced, who use reasoning, Table 4 Tasks for which infection control/hospital hygiene doctors played a role as responsible persons and or as contributors, European countries, 2006 (IPSE, 31 countries) and 2010 (TRICE, 33 countries) Grade of responsibility TaskNumber (percentage) of countries reporting task 2006 (n=31) 2010 (n=33) ResponsibleIdentification and investigation of outbreaks 21 (68%) 30 (91%) Analysis and feedback of IC/HH data 21 (68%) 25 (76%) Elaboration of an IC/HH programme, workplan and projects 19 (61%) 24 (73%) Management (implementation, follow-up, evaluation) of an IC/HH programme, workplan and projects20 (65%) 23 (70%) Design of a surveillance system 15 (48%) 22 (67%) Elaboration of IC/HH procedures 16 (52%) 22 (67%) Management (implementation, follow-up, evaluation) of HAI surveillance 15 (48%) 21 (64%) Providing expertise in IC/HH policy 16 (52%) 21 (64%) Training of hospital employees in IC/HH 15 (48%) 20 (61%) Audits and performance evaluation of organisations and parts of them 15 (48%) 19 (58%) Research 13 (42%) 17 (52%) Implementation of IC/HH procedures 12 (39%) 17 (52%) Antibiotics policy 14 (45%) 17 (52%) ContributorQuality management 21 (68%) 25 (76%) Elaboration of healthcare procedures 18 (58%) 23 (70%) Risk management 21 (65%) 23 (70%) Clinical management of infected or at-risk patients 12 (39%) 22 (67%) Contributing to building renovation plans NA 21 (64%) Contribution to construction and design of healthcare buildings NA 20 (61%) Prescription of antibiotics 12 (39%) 19 (58%) Employee health 15(48%) 19 (58%) Implementation of healthcare procedures 17 (55%) 19 (58%) Selection of supplies or products used in the hospital NA 19 (58%) HAI: healthcare-associated infections; IC/HH: infection control Safety in Europe; NA: not available; TRICE: Training needs assessment in Infection Control in Europe.

The final agreed 'core competencies for infection con - trol and hospital hygiene professionals in the European Union' are available from the ECDC website [13] and are organised in four areas (programme management, quality improvement, surveillance and investigation of HAI, and IC/HH activities) and 16 domains, each with core competencies for a junior and a senior specialist. Table 6 summarises the structure of the document. In this context it is necessary to stress that the speci - fication was for IC/HH specialists in acute care hos - pitals and that the core competencies were similar for IC/HH nurses and IC/HH doctors, including those competencies relating to antimicrobial stewardship because of the increasing numbers of prescribing nurses in European countries and their greater strate - gic involvement. Discussion The TRICE project has provided data for a compre - hensive overview of the characteristics, training for professionals, tasks and related core competencies for European IC/HH professionals in 2010. It will also inform future trend analyses, as almost all countries have reported their current situation. The decision to use the questionnaire on core competencies that was used by the IPSE project in 2006, enabled us to evalu - ate the progress of European countries between 2006 and 2010. In particular, our results showed that IPSE initiatives and the European core curriculum developed by the project IPSE already had an impact on the crea - tion of new national curricula for IC/HH training, on the definition of professional profiles, in particular for IC/HH doctors, and on the development or adaptation of the content of new or existing courses in European countries. Nevertheless, well-defined qualifications, standardised training pathways and agreed competen - cies for IC/HH professionals were still lacking in 2010. A critical point is that, in 2010, almost half of the coun - tries still did not have an official recognition of qualifi - cations for an IC/HH doctor or an IC/HH nurse. The professional backgrounds of IC/HH doctors and IC/ HH nurses in European countries were homogeneous, which should make the process of harmonisation of training programmes achievable. IC/HH doctors were most commonly trained in microbiology, followed by infectious diseases, hygiene and public health. In 28 of 33 countries, IC/HH nurses had a minimum of three years of experience as a graduated/certified nurse.Table 5 Tasks for which infection control/hospital hygiene nurses played a role as responsible persons or as contributors, European countries, 2006 (IPSE, 31 countries) and 2010 (TRICE, 33 countries) Grade of responsibility TaskNumber (percentage) of countries reporting task 2006 (n=31) 2010 (n=33) ResponsibleTraining of hospital employees in IC/HH 18 (58%) 24 (73%) Elaboration of IC/HH procedures 18 (58%) 23 (70%) Implementation of IC/HH procedures 18 (58%) 21 (64%) Procedures for disinfection of medical devices 13 (42%) 21 (64%) Management (implementation, follow-up, evaluation) of an IC/HH programme, workplan and projects14 (45%) 19 (58%) Audits and performance evaluation of organisations and parts of them 14 (45%) 18 (55%) Identification and investigation of outbreaks 13 (42%) 18 (52%) ContributorRisk management 22 (71%) 17 (52%) Quality management 22 (71%) 23 (70%) Design of a surveillance system 18 (58%) 23 (70%) Employee health 14 (45%) 21 (64%) Elaboration of healthcare procedures 20 (65%) 21 (64%) Research 17 (55%) 20 (61%) Implementation of healthcare procedures 17 (55%) 19 (58%) Clinical management of infected or at risk patients 14 (45%) 18 (55%) Providing expertise in IC/HH policy 14 (45%) 17 (52%) Work organisation in clinical units 10 (32%) 17 (52%) IC/HH: infection control and hospital hygiene; IPSE: Improving Patient Safety in Europe; TRICE: Training needs assessment in Infection Control in Europe. Only the tasks reported by at least 50% of countries in 2010 are mentioned.52 www.eurosurveillance.orgMore than 80% of the respondents reported that a def - inition of the Infection Control Team existed in national programmes or regulations. The professionals most frequently included were doctors and nurses that were the focus of the survey. In future projects it would be useful to explore more in detail also the role of other professionals engaged in the infection control team. The type of degree or learning to become an IC/HH spe - cialist remained heterogeneous among European coun - tries. This reinforces the need for common standards for the training of IC/HH professionals. In this context, our proposal for European core competencies for IC/HH professionals in the European Union [13] is expected to promote the standardisation of the competencies of IC/HH professionals in Europe and the design and imple - mentation of training courses according to different national contexts and to facilitate the mutual recogni - tion of competencies across Europe. It further serves as an opportunity for IC/HH professionals to review their own performance and plan their professional develop - ment and for healthcare institutions and organisations to evaluate their needs in terms of professional human resources and to evaluate the performance of the exist - ing IC/HH professionals. European core competencies are useful for countries without a national curriculum or programme to pro - mote new training initiatives for IC/HH professionals according to European standards. For other countries, European core competencies represent an opportu - nity to identify gaps in their curricula and to organise IC/HH according to the different levels of expertise. These European core competencies will thus act as a point of reference for the development of IC/HH train - ing initiatives and harmonisation of these courses and qualifications. Professional competency grows in a continuum, where the speed and the completeness depend on several parameters. Under certain circumstances, these com - petencies will have to be developed very quickly. This will depend on many variables such as the expecta - tion that IC/HH doctors or nurses will chair an IC/HH committee at an agreed time after appointment, on how long there have been IC/HH doctors or nurses in a country, on whether adequate resources are avail - able (e.g. administrative support), on the presence and need to interact with audit/patient safety departments, and on IC/HH team members' aptitudes, preferences and previous experiences. For example, some new IC/HH professionals may have acquired considerable management experience and transferable skills from previous positions in other specialties before embark - ing upon their IC/HH career. The proposed core competencies for IC/HH profession - als in the European Union were developed in 2010. Since this date, the North American Certification Board Table 6 Core competencies for infection control and hospital hygiene professionals in the European Union, by area and domain, 2010 Area DomainNumber of competencies Programme managementElaborating and advocating an infection control programme 7 Management of an infection control programme, workplan and projects 20 Quality improvementContributing to quality management 4 Contributing to risk management 2 Performing audits of professional practices and evaluating performance 9 Infection control training of employees 5 Contributing to research 2 Surveillance and Investigation of healthcare-associated infectionsDesigning a surveillance system 8 Managing (implementation, follow-up, evaluation) a surveillance system 9 Identifying, investigating and managing outbreaks 7 Infection control activitiesElaborating infection control interventions 14 Implementing infection control procedures in healthcare 5 Contributing to reducing antimicrobial resistance 8 Advising appropriate laboratory testing and use of laboratory data 3 Decontamination and sterilisation of medical devices 4 Controlling environmental sources of infections 2 IC/HH: infection control and hospital hygiene; IPSE: Improving Patient Safety in Europe; TRICE: Training needs assessment in Infection Control in Europe. Only the tasks reported by at least 50% of countries in 2010 are mentioned.53 www.eurosurveillance.orgof Infection Control and Epidemiology (CBIC) has pub - lished a proposal for a conceptual model including four specific domains that represent the areas for future development of competencies: leadership, infection prevention and control, technology and performance improvement and implementation science [15]. This model does not conflict with the European approach, although it proposes an intermediate level (profi - ciency) between the expert and the novice. Such an intermediate level was considered by the NRs but was rejected as they expected that it may add confusion to the already heterogeneous situation in Europe. The TRICE two-level approach was considered more effec - tive to promote standardisation of IC/HH training, and it takes into account the important diversity of dura - tion and content of the existing IC/HH training courses in Europe. Furthermore, all participants to the TRICE agreed that a minimum of competencies for junior/introductory level was useful for both organisations and professionals and acting as a platform for per - sonal and professional development. The NRs also recommended that the proposed core competencies for IC/HH professionals in the European Union [13] should be seen as stages of a journey with a distinction between the two main categories (jun - ior specialist/introductory level and senior specialist/expert level). They should be useful for the produc - tion of tools aimed at helping the development of IC/HH training courses. The introductory level should be considered appropriate for those involved in all tech - nical/common tasks and responsibilities, whereas the expert level should apply to professionals with expe - rience of political challenges or with new, complex, unusual or unexpected situations. The proposed core competencies should address the design of training courses developed preferably according to the Bologna process for standardisation of credits and recogni - tion and to the standards proposed by the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education [16], and they should be owned by those involved as trainers in these courses. Conclusion Based on the findings of the TRICE project, we consider that Europe is moving toward acknowledgement and a higher priority for HAI prevention and control. There is nevertheless room for improvement, especially in the recognition of the IC/HH degree for IC/HH profession - als and in the standardisation and mutual recognition in Europe of the IC/HH training initiatives. The future impact of the core competencies for IC/HH professionals in the European Union [13] will depend on (i) the existence of validated IC/HH training courses designed and delivered to enable the acquisition of these competencies, (ii) the widespread recognition that IC/HH doctors and IC/HH nurses need these com - petencies to ensure that a hospital IC/HH programme meets its goals and agreed deliverables, (iii) the exist - ence of a sustained strategy ensuring that the core competencies are updated and reviewed at European level and owned and adopted by those running the training courses and (iv) the sustained coordination of, and support for a network for IC/HH training in Europe that will ensure the long-term commitment of institu - tions to the programmes. Finally, while training of IC/HH professionals should become a priority for European countries, more empha - sis should also be given to basic training in IC/HH in nursing schools and in medical universities. Ensuring that all healthcare personnel has received such basic training before starting their professional activity would certainly contribute to further improvement in the quality of healthcare throughout Europe.

Enhancing infectious disease mapping with open access resources . Euro Surveill. 2014;19(49):pii=20989. Available online: http://www. eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20989 Article published on 11 December 2014 The Spatial Ecology and Epidemiology Group (SEEG) at the University of Oxford is currently carrying out sev - eral disease and vector mapping projects. The source code for many of these projects have been and will con - tinue to be made openly available through our GitHub account. This archive includes a description of the R software package 'seegSDM', that allows for species distribution modelling using a boosted regression tree approach and a walkthrough tutorial. This method has been successfully applied to diseases such as dengue, ebola virus, leishmaniasis, and anopheline vectors. The group has collated a number of globally compre - hensive and up-to-date databases from published and unpublished sources. The databases compile geo - graphically located records of occurrence, from three sources: (i) comprehensive PubMed searches, (ii) infor - mation from unpublished health surveys and entomo - logical field studies made available by collaborators, and (iii) internet disease surveillance systems such as HealthMap. These occurrences, defined as unique spa - tio-temporal records of pathogen transmission or vec - tor presence, serve as standardised input data used to generate global risk maps. Prior to modelling these databases all go through a number of technical valida - tion steps to ensure their spatio-temporal accuracy and overall validity. This is facilitated by overlaying these occurrence records with independently derived evi - dence consensus maps that summarise the quality and diversity of disease information. Disease and vector specific databases are then made openly available through online depositories which cover the diseases mentioned above. Similarly, occurrence records of the dominant vector species of malaria and more comprehensive prevalence datasets of the global distribution of Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax [1] and related inherited blood dis - orders are downloadable through the Malaria Atlas Project. Details about collection methods, design and validation of the respective datasets can be found either in published research articles or within data descriptor publications [2-4].Future efforts include developing the Atlas of Baseline Risk Assessment for Infectious Diseases (ABRAID), an automated mapping platform which integrates the framework described above to generate spatially comprehensive, iteratively improving, evidence based maps of disease risk at the global level for a prioritised number of infectious diseases [5].
