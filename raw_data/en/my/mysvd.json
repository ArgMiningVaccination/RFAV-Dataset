It takes control of your brain, mercilessly robbing you of the ability to find pleasure in anything other than the drug itself. Many people report that the high they received from their first hit of meth was infinitely greater than any joy or stimulation they had ever felt. For many, the siren call of meth is impossible to resist after this experience. Without professional crystal meth rehab, their lives can quickly spin out of control. The Toll Meth Takes Like other drugs such as cocaine, the euphoric effect of meth happens because the drug forces your brain to produce higher than normal amounts of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that rewards you with a heady sensation of pleasure. This same substance is released in the brains of marathon athletes, who describe it as a \"runner's high.\" The difference between meth and other amphetamines, however, is that it makes your brain pump out even higher amounts of dopamine. Over time, meth ravages the dopamine receptors in your brain. Eventually, the only way you can feel any sort of pleasure is by using increasingly high amounts of meth. Before long, you're on an endless hamster wheel, spending most or all of your time and energy either getting high or obtaining more meth. As a result, professional obligations, relationships, finances and responsibilities lose their importance. Meanwhile, the drug is rewiring the pathways of your brain and your physical health is suffering. Meth addiction treatment is crucial to living a normal life again.
