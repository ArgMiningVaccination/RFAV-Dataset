Denise Clarke Master of Education Thesis, 2005 Department of Sociology and Equity Studies in Education Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto Entering the academy as an adult, working-class student in a program that prepared me for university, and subsequently as an undergraduate student, challenged me in many ways, especially in learning how to write in the language of the academy. Employing an arts-based and auto-ethnographic approach, I discuss some of my experiences in the academy, drawing attention to language usage in expository writing while focusing on written wounding comments from teaching assistants on my marked papers. This thesis reveals how teaching assistants' written comments can wound and traumatize students, injuring their spirit. This work raises awareness about how story-telling can also help build self-confidence, can empower and can foster peaceful environments that enable students to heal and recover academically from invisible wounds. It also shows how students may gain spiritual strength for academic success to solve and respond to trauma in the academy. The learning objectives are to share my story, extend the discussion to a critique of the academy, and to point to broader questions of students' resistance and survival in the academy. ili Acknowledgements The past two years at OISE have been one the most wonderful times in my academic life. I finally found a place where I felt comfortable to express myself, work with professors who encouraged and supported my work, as well as friends whom I could confide in, and nag every day about my thesis topic. Instructors: Njoki Wane\u2014 my supervisor, thanks for your humble ways and for your patience\u2014 I could always knock on your office door across from the computer room or stop you in the corridors to talk about my thesis or to talk to you about my coursework and -load. Thanks also for educating me on Black feminist topics. Jean Mason\u2014 my second reader, thanks for your prompt response to questions and for expanding my knowledge on writing theory. For helping me to focus on \"Trauma\"\u2014 instead of you know ubat. It's made such a big difference, made everything less confrontational. It allows me to get to the essence of the story. George Dei\u2014 thanks for listening when I wanted clarification, for your open door policy that I took advantage of. Thanks for seeing through the pain in my paper\u2014 the wounding of the spirit\u2014 when I did not have the right words to say. Guy Allen\u2014 thanks for making me know and feel that academic writing can be less painful\u2014I have too much to say thanks for so I'll just say, Thanks. Frederick Case\u2014 thanks for informing me about OISE when I wanted to re-enter the academy, and for imparting your wisdom about the academy to me. Tom Mathien\u2014 thanks for always caring about my survival in university. I am grateful for all the times you edited my papers. Friends: Paulina Rejniewicz, your friendship is invaluable\u2014 come back soon. Ericka Neegan, for gently coaxing me into finishing the last draft and for all our little personal and academic talks. Rosena Joseph, you are truly a great friend\u2014 compassion and wisdom you have. I wish you all the best. Bakary Gibba, we've come so far together and I want you to know that your desire to achieve your educational goal inspires me to achieve mine. iv Ryad Shahjahan, you know how to connect spiritually and academically, thanks for all your little and big tips that still help me on my academic path. Family: My mother, Evelyn, and sisters, Barbara, Paulette (your husbands too), including younger sister Michelle and all my nieces and nephews for caring and understanding my academic choices even when it seemed like I should have quit. Your help in caring for Danier throughout my academic studies made my workload (home and school) much lighter. Danier, my son, your existence in this world has only made my life better. You've helped me to find meaning in my life. Thanks to John Curie, for being a part of my life, for support and encouragement in completing this thesis and for working with me to keep me on track. Dedication I dedicate this thesis to the staff at Transitional Year Programme at the University of Toronto. You helped me to see when my vision blurred To speak when words were hard to find To hear without listening too hard To smell academic troubles from afar To taste of the sugar in knowledge You Cradled Taught Guided And Protected Me Thanks to all the staff who worked with me during my TYP year, the years after and even now. Thanks for the foundation and the continued encouragement. \"The shortest path to greatness is along with others\" (Balthasar Gracian, translated by Joseph Jacobs, 1993). vi This poem reflects some of the experiences I've had in the academy. BORN IN POVERTY, AIN'T GONNA DIE IN POVERTY This is how I choose to elevate myself Through torturous years attending school Self-imprisonment, bondage and suppression Born in poverty, ain't gonna die in poverty My language don't fit, my writing sucks I fear to write 'cause I don't write right It's a new world I'm in, not the one I'm used to Born in poverty ain't gonna die in poverty My papers are late, my grades are poor My pocket is empty, my soul needs rest Walk in my shoes just for one day Born in poverty, ain't gonna die in poverty When I think of days spent in libraries School halls, classrooms, listening to philosophers, Educators and inspirators, the good and the bad, I empower myself Born in poverty, ain't gonna die in poverty I can't take this bull, you talking down to me Me, powerless soul?\u2014 My grades, my academic future Depend on letting you take control, control over my mind (but temporarily) Born in poverty, ain't gonna die in poverty I can't spend much time with my child Capitalism, societal and family pressure, pushing me to achieve I must stay in this battle, not going to lose this fight Born in poverty, ain't gonna die in poverty. What do these privileged, upper-class professors know about sole-support parentage, About poverty, about attending school in your late twenties, thirties, and forties About raising children on your own? They may not know and perhaps don't understand ey must accommodate me Born in poverty, ain't gonna die in poverty. Denise Clarke: 2000.

My dear reader, let us communicate from our hearts so that teaching and learning will be engaging and fulfilling activities and experiences that will promote better mental health in our learners. Connect with Me My reader, I ask that you pause for a moment before you read further. Relax and think about the conrrents above, the written responses or feedback from teachers to students' writings. The comments, similar in meaning but from different parts of the world, demonstrate the need for us to rethink how teachers comment on their students' essays. Think about how /anguage, the way people put words together to make meaning, produces social and educational boundaries and categories. Think about how language creates hierarchies between teachers and students in the academy. Peter Elbow (1973) states that, \"only people have meaning. Words can only have meaning attributed to them by people\" (151). Think about how words can be put together, intentionally or unintentionally, to wound. Think about the many students all over the world who suffer wounds from comments because their teachers do not understand the students' unique voices in creating meaning through language. As you think, I caution you that my thesis is not written in the traditional academic expository model. It diverges from such a norm, taking on a variety of artistic and creative forms such as poetry, expressive writing and metaphors \"to communicate experience\" (Veale: 2004, ui). Other creative forms are the uses of split text and palimpsest, \"new forms that further inquiry without demanding exclusive adherence to rigid\" academic writing structures (Diamond, Amold & Wearing: 1999, 428). As such, this thesis is an arts-based narrative inquiry, a process whereby I create meaning from my experience (Connelly & Clandinin: 1990, 10). It is also an amtoethnography. Autoethnography opens \"up a space of resistance between the individual (auto\u2014) and the collective (\u2014 ethno\u2014 ) where the writing (\u2014 graphy\u2014 of singularity cannot be foreclosed\" (Kamer: 2001, 4 cites Brodkey: 1990, 391). As I write, you will, sometimes feel the flow of my words as I express myself in language I feel at ease with. Other times, you will feel as I feel, that I am wearing the \"straight-jacket\" that comes with expository writing\u2014 the jacket I have tried to remove but often cannot because of my academic goals. My reader, as you embark on this journey with me, think about how together we could join hands, and perhaps hearts too, to bring about change in the academy, all over the world. Journey with Me I welcome you to read about my journey as an undergraduate, working-class Black female student in the academy.' Read about how I wandered worried among words and waddled wary into the war zore of school life or onto the Luttlefield\u2014 war metaphors I use to explain my feelings and the atmosphere in which I studied. As I trudged through the new academic territory, some words hit me so hard; they felt like bullets to my brain that ricocheted from the walls inside my head and dug into the depth of my spirit, my soul, my feelings or my emotions. Spirit, according to Frederick Case (2004) exists within spirituality. I employ George Dei's definition of spirit as representation \"of the self as a necessary condition\" (Dei: 2001, 4). My spirit experienced traunu as a reaction to a wound (Bonnie: 2003a, 1302) from wounding words such as the comment \"hotch-potch of confusion\" I found on one of my papers. Trauma or shock sparks unsafe, fearful, terrifying feelings of \"hopelessness, helplessness, worthlessness, despair, distrust, rage and oftentimes, guilt\" (Bonnie: 2003a,1302 cites Lewis: 1999). I experienced these feelings as a result of such comments. In general, I hope you will discover that students who write papers face the risk of experiencing trauma, as they do not know how readers will respond to their writing. Research and Learning Objectives The research objective of this journey is to examine language, uniting? comments, traurm, the wounding of the spirit in the academy and my resistances to such wounds. (Later I will explain the meaning of the italicized terms.) Language, writing, comments and trauma, in this thesis, go hand- in-hand. As a new undergraduate student, synthesizing my working-class language with my ' Academy, in this thesis, refers to university, higher education, and the Transitional Year Program (TYP). * Like spirit and spirituality, comments, evaluation and assessment will be used interchangeably. pretentious, unrefined, imposter academic language to write my papers, I received devastating comments from Teaching A ssistants (TAs), who are usually graduate students employed to assist professors. I want to show how devastating comments written by TAs have caused me trauma and can cause trauma to others. The learning objectives vary. I want to inform those who work and study in the academy about comments and trauma. Matthew Stewart (1998) states that, \"[fJeeling that I'm being heard is central to learning... . [I am] allowed to move, for we never tell the same story twice. This educative process is also the healing process of letting go\" (9), a step for me to forge ahead. I hope that by taking this journey, I will transform myself as a student and the teacher I hope to be by caring for my students' learning. I hope that by sharing my story, I will help prevent other students who might make the same mistakes I made in writing my papers. I want TAs to become more aware of the potential their comments have to do harm. After presenting a part of chapter five at a conference, an instructor informed me that, although she tried not to give students bad comments, before hearing my presentation, she had never given much thought to how her comments might affect students. I want to extend the discussion of comments to a critique of the academy and to point to broader questions of students' resistance and survival. Finally, I want to suggest a change in policy on the training of TAs. The Focus Although I will examine written and verbal comments from a number of professors and TAs in this thesis, my motive stems mainly from a wounding comment written by a TA on my first paper written for a university course at the University of Toronto. I decided to focus on TAs as the comments that impacted me the most came from them. Though I focus on these comments, I do not claim that destructively negative comments are a standard practice among TAs. As well, I certainly do not claim that all students have the same experience as do many working-class students in the academy. Students differ in their abilities regardless of race, class, gender and age, as students enter the university with different skills and different levels of academic preparation. Importantly, not all students will experience trauma from negative comments. Richard J. McNally (2003) found that \"some people are more likely than others to experience trauma\" (90). Furthermore, \"[t]he way in which a potentially traumatic event is appraised and interpreted may be largely influenced by cultural expectation and norms; what is traumatic for one culture may not be so for another\" (Creamer: 1995, 55). The thesis is about (1) the language I used to write my papers; (2) the power of comments; (3) the trauma and the injuring of my spirit as a result of the comments; (4) the impact of these injuries on my academic progress; and (5) my reaction and resistance to the comments. Even though the considerations are personal, there are nevertheless lessons to be learned that can be applied to students in circumstances similar to mine. The Research Problem This research is important, as there is a scarcity of scholarly work on the impact of comments on students' papers, especially comments written by TAs. Some of the main problems explored are: = Comments on students' papers can cause trauma. \u00ab TAs are sometimes not aware that their comments can wound. \u00ab Students who experience trauma from comments sometimes do not reveal it. \"In Canada, the training of TAs on commenting on students' papers is almost non-existent. = Some TAs require sensitivity training to address the various difficulties students might have in writing papers. Some of the problems listed have been acknowledged. For example, Brown and Knight (1994) argue that not all tutors [TAs] have the sensitivity to hear [or read] what the faltering learner is saying; not all faltering learners have the confidence to explain what they (mis)understand; and creating a dialogue that makes a difference requires skill and perhaps training too. We also recall that tutors [TAs] tend to be people who have soared past conceptual confusion, methodological muddles and prose problems. It is not always easy for them, as experts, to understand why a novice should find difficulty with something [writing] that appears to be quite elementary (12). If the problem of miscommunication between TAs and students is to be resolved, and the educational efforts of TAs made more effective, there needs to be a policy to address the void in their training as commentators. These problems reveal the importance of this research. Significance of the Research Reclaiming my voice, language and writing as a Black female student is important for both personal and academic reasons. Personally, it is liberating for me in more than one way. First, I write to break my silence about trauma in the academy. bell hooks (1989) writes that moving from silence into speech is a \"gesture of defiance that heals, that makes new life and new growth possible\" (9). Second, I want to share my pain from the past as way of opening up a space where students who have experienced similar problems can feel that they too can break their silences. Third, I write this arts-based autoethnography to help free me from the constraints of tradition in the university, even though this freedom comes with a price. According to Mullen and Diamond (1999), \"by telling stories of oppression and emancipation, whether in prison or in academe, outlaws are born\" (268).\u00b0 As an outlaw, I have to be careful as to how my story might be interpreted. The university is still, for the most part, absorbed in tradition. Yet I believe that the importance of raising awareness about comments and the trauma they cause far outweigh the price of committing to an Fea person and icon of oppression, is seized, confined, and held captive in the restrictive and /or expansive space of a surveillant community\" (Mullen and Diamond; 1999, p. 259). art-based research or of leaving myself vulnerable to misinterpretations or unfavourable interpretations of my experiences. Academically, the research is important for a number of reasons. First, this research will augment the limited body of scholarly work on the relationships between TAs and their students. Second, it exposes trauma from a position that many academics may not have considered because many perhaps have never suspected that comments could cause trauma. Third, teachers and TAs might be able to identify when students experience trauma by assessing the effects revealed in this thesis. Fourth, the conclusions drawn that non-wounding or constructive comments can build self- confidence, empower and foster peaceful/caring environments that enable students to heal or recover academically from the invisible wounds are invaluable for relationships between students and teachers. Constructive comments allow students to gain spiritual strength for academic success. Fifth, the research will benefit many other students, bring awareness to TAs and administrators of problems that need solutions. Research Questions In addressing the problems of language usage, comments and trauma in my story, I ask questions to help guide to my study, to assist me in my search for answers to human frailties in the academy, and to help pave a path for those who might benefit from this study. These are the key questions: 1. What kind of writing is expected from undergraduate students and are there general criteria that TAs follow when commenting on students' essays? 2. What happens to some working-class students' language usage in their term papers when they enter the academic community? 3. Do comments affect students. If so, how? In what follows, I will highlight the importance of this work and emphasize the need for the educational system to respond to and address questions like the above, as well as to create clarity between TAs and students. These questions serve as vehicles that might create new policies for the training and assignment of TAs, not only in Ontario but also in other parts of Canada and throughout the world. My Standpoint I ama student and a single mother from a working-class background. I was born in Jamaica. My ancestors, according to my family tree, came from Africa and Syria (to name the two places known for sure). I am the sixth of seven children raised by my mother. I am the first in my family to attend university and to obtain a graduate degree. I did not have a strong support network of friends and family members to call on when I had academic troubles. However, I met some professors and mentors along my academic journey\u2014 who often guided me. I am grateful to have met them. I feel that some administrators, teachers and teaching assistants in universities do not always make suitable accommodations to working-class students (economically disadvantaged students or single mothers) struggling to obtain good grades, graduate from university, and possibly go on to graduate studies. I feel people in positions of power in the academy negatively judge students from certain social and linguistic communities based on an entrenched academic expectation about how one should look, speak, write and behave. My lived experience in the academy shapes how I view it. Organization of this Thesis The previous section introduced my research and learning objectives, pointing to language usage in writing papers and problems with TAs' written comments that wound or have the potential to wound students. I want to inform others about the problems of TAs' comments so that universities can address them. I want to show that this research also helped me break my silence on this topic. In addition, it has included my point of view as a working-class student. Chapter 1 discusses key words and meanings in the context of the paper. These words are: writing, language, comments, assessment, evaluation, feedback, teaching assistants, trauma, spirit, spiritual wound and spiritual empowerment. As meaning is often context-based, I will show how my words fit into the thesis. I write the meanings in poetic form. I will also discuss the background to the study with an examination about how I came to this topic. I write on this topic because I had received a wounding comment and while taking an expressive writing course, the memory returned. As a result, I dealt with the memory, the trauma, by writing this thesis. Chapter 2 examines the literature on writing, language, comments, trauma, TAs, and the spirit in the academy. It documents how my work fits in the existing literature while acknowledging that there is not enough work on TAs and the wounding comments they write. However, it also discusses that the scarcity of work on this topic might be due to students' fear of telling others about the comments on their papers. I look at TAs and their work, paying attention to media reports on TAs at U of T while exploring the roles departments play in TAs' training?. This chapter also discusses trauma, academics and spirituality. Chapter 3 employs the use of theory. The role of theory is multifunctional, such as helping to advance or guide the work or theory of another. Discourse community theory helps to bring deeper understanding to my life in the new academic community. It helps to highlight the challenges that students can experience in academy as we learn to grasp the discourse of the academic community. Chapter 4 explores the method and methodology to conduct and carry out this research. A qualitative arts-based case study is important for examining the self while the use of metaphors and 10 imagery such as war and battlefield highlight my struggles or fights and victories in the university. In addition, the use of story-telling as data from memory and comments on papers help to provide me with the data I need to complete the research. Chapter 5 narrates my experience in the present tense using split text. On the right sits my story, while on the left sit excerpts from other authors' texts. I examine entering a new community, trying to grasp the language, discovering that my writing was inadequate according to some T'As' and instructors' standards and becoming wounded by TAs' comments. I address my language usage in my writing, trauma from comments, fear, silence, and shame. I illustrate how I gained the confidence to write better after a professor allowed me to write in my mother tongue and to use \"I\" in my writing. I show how I lost confidence and experienced trauma again as a TA failed me in a course. I describe being re-traumatized as another TA's comment remind me of the first comment that traumatized me. In addition, I explore how, despite my challenges, I completed university and received my B.A. Hounours degree. Chapter 6 surveys the research and discusses the important findings. It shows how I struggle to adapt to the language of the academy and to write it, how I develop a False Self as I try to be someone I am not. The chapter explores how when I used \"I\" in my writing and my mother tongue, writing was less difficult for me. The findings also reveal that my language usage in my writing might have irritated the TAs. I realized too that from the wound, feelings such as fear, silence, and shame facilitate a paralysis in me that often prevents me from writing my papers. Finally, Chapter 7 points to how I came to know the academy and it recommends the writing of stories in the academy. I also propose the acknowledgement of spirit and that educators should bring in feeling or the spirit in their relationship with their students. Lastly, it suggests questions for researchers to think about or to conduct further study on. 11 Chapter 1: Meanings and Background to the Study Language and Meaning Dialogue, as the encounter of men addressed to the common task of learning and acting, is broken if the parties (or one of them) lack humility. How can I dialogue if I always project ignorance onto others and never perceive my own? How can I dialogue if I regard myself as a case apart from other men... ? How can I dialogue if I consider myself... the owner of truth and knowledge, for whom all non-members are 'these people' or the 'the great unwashed'? ... Men [and women] who lack humility (or have lost it) cannot come to the people, cannot be partners in naming the world. Someone who cannot acknowledge himself to be as mortal as everyone sees still has a long way to go before he can reach the point of encounter. At the point of encounter there are neither utter ignoramuses nor perfect sages; there are only men [and women] who are attempting, together to learn more than they now know (Freire: 1968, 79). Freire talks about learning together and I often wonder if some of my teachers were learning with me during my undergraduate years. When I first entered university, I felt alienated in the academic community, excluded by the writing and the language\u2014 the jargon. Therefore, before I proceed further with this research I want to clarify some of the key terms that I will use in this paper. My hope is that, anyone who reads this thesis will be able to understand the words within the context of this paper. I do not expect everyone to know what I know and to pretend that I always know what each person knows. Moreover, even if I think I know what others know, I sometimes might not know what they mean in things they do or say. Peter Elbow (1973) makes this argument more clearly in how language might be interpreted. \"Meaning in ordinary language is in the middle. It is pushed and pulled simultaneously by forces that try to make it fluid and dreamlike but fixed like mathematics\" (153)... But the mathematics-like force for order is just as strong. That is, though words in ordinary language can mean anything, they only do mean what the speech community let them mean at that moment. But unlike mathematics, these agreements are not explicitly set down and agree to. That is, our rules for building meaning into words are unspoken and are learned by doing, listening to other, and even by listening to ourselves (154). 12 The words I used in this thesis are sometimes fixed like Elbow states but sometimes they are more fluid. Sometimes words do not truly convey to others what we really mean unless the users declare their meanings. The words I write or say, give a \"set of directions for building [my] own meaning\" (Elbow: 1973, 152). In addition, words can have multiple meanings, and are often context based. \"Thus we must make absolutely clear what we mean when we use an established term\" (Seidler: 2000, 123-4). I will offer the definitions of the terms in bold face below as they relate to my thesis about language, writing, comments, trauma and resistance to the spiritual wound. Poetic Definitions Language Writing Comment Language, to write, to talk, to express Words making meaning Vetbal or written interaction With oneself or another Language is way People or communities put words Together to communicate The meaning they create When they use their words It could be street talk Or professional talk Or academic talk Writing, Data written Whether by pencil, pen Computer or typewriter Alphabets that breathe words And words communicate Logically\u2014whose logic? Organized flow of words Or string of words Ideas, stories, thoughts Expression Visible Written Record Voice Self Text A Comment is a remark ot a response What you said or What you wrote on my paper You commented on what I did Assessment 13 Assessment! You've gathered Whatever information you have on my learning You looked at things I did My essay is a good example Did I write well or can you understand what I wrote? You try to come to some conclusion (Brown and Malcolm: 1997, 8) You seek to know what I know and understand And what I'm capable of doing as a result of my learning And you can take what you've assessed that I might know And from there you can help You want to improve my learning (Huba and Freed: 2000, 8). You will see that, in all kinds of assessment A person's current status is revealed (Brown and Malcolm: 1997, 9). In the end, through assessment You will provide to me the learner Guidance and feedback (Brown and Malcolm: 1997, 8). And assessment has different categories Developmental assessment, for example, Concerns itself with the betterment of students learning And is good because it relies on trust of assessment In the educational system And the students that depend on it (Brown, Bull Pendlebury: 1997, 9). Judgmental assessment Purpose is for accountability And also promotional or marketing strategies This assessment must be consistent, must be uniform Assessing for fairness But under this assessment, things can go wrong And judgmental assessment in university Can go very wrong (Brown and Malcolm: 1997, 9). \"You cannot write\" Don't be a bad judge Evaluation Feedback 14 Teachings Assistants Evaluation, according to Elbow, means two different activities\" Measurement (or Feedback is to help make me improve My writing, my exam skills, or even my reading grading or ranking) Whatever \u2014 But feedback must And commentary (or be useful feedback).\" Must be acceptable to me the The two, measurement and teceivet commentary It must be \"specific, accurate, Sometimes create confusion (Elbow: 1986, 231). But evaluation is a judgment Based on how I performed Your conclusion to what I did timely, clear\" To encourage to help my ptogtess If necessary\" (Brown, Bull, Pendlebury Malcolm: 1997, 4). Teaching Assistants (TAs) TAs are often graduate students Researchers and students They work with professors They get paid but not too much And they perform various functions They evaluate papers They mark exams They sometimes tutor But most are still students Trauma Trauma is shock It doesn't have to be physical Could be non-physical too I might lose control And sometimes: Trauma overwhelms \"the ordinary human Adaptation to life ..... Trauma confronts Scared back gone Can't remember Dumbfounded Terrified Feeling that I can't survive That all hope is gone And sometimes I'm taken To memories I thought were in ways we feel we cannot help ourselves And thoughts and feeling of terror \"{E]voke responses of catastrophe\" (Herman: 1992, 33) There's no one way to judge trauma Only the person who feels it Knows what it is (Horsman: 1999, 43). And I wish I could erase them... So stop!\u2014there are multiple ways to judge trauma And only the person who feels it knows it Spirit Spiritual Wound 15 Spiritual Empowerment Spirit is the self The way I feel Spirituality could be deep In our mind In our body In our soul It's our connection with the universe It's personal It guides you it keeps you Keeps you feeling Spirituality is with you always Spiritual wound is an injury Or a wound to the soul To my entire being All my feelings My happiness My living I feel sick Feel sorry for myself Feel sad Hurt Paralysis Numbs my life Spiritual empowerment I will imagine spiritual empowerment as an appreciation and cultivation of the spiritual element in whatever we're doing (Foehr: 1997, 50 cite Moore). Background to the Study I write on writing, language, comments, trauma and resistance from the spiritual wound in the academy to expose the burden of secret and shame about my writing that I had carried like a weight on my back throughout my undergraduate studies. I am not alone in exploring a topic based on a personal experience. Other researchers too, have written academic works that originate from personal experiences. Researchers such as David Boud (1995), Shumona Ray (2003), Paulina Rejniewicz (2004), and Erica (Neegan) Dennis (2003) concede that a personal experience prompted their research interest. Barbara Kamler (2001) writes that, \"[s]tudent writing about the self is valued because it affirms the student's own language and experience and because... it advocates a critical interrogation of voice \u2014 where student writing is not only affirmed, but questioned\" (38). I came to this topic because I felt like a failure and doubted myself, learning that my language was deficient because of a TA's comment on a paper. This thesis is, in part, an act of recovery from trauma and a resistance to the intrusion. 16 Wounding comment During my studies at a Transitional Year Programme (TYP), a TA wrote a negative comment on my first paper written for a university course. I had rewritten the paper overnight after I could not find my disk with a draft I had completed. I handed in the paper the following day and met the deadline. I did not want to hand in a late paper. When I received the marked paper and read the comments, I cried. The TA had written a deeply wounding comment on my paper. I did not rip the paper in pieces. I did not throw it out. I wanted to keep it despite the wounding of my spirit and the shame I felt. Shame, flourishes \"[w]henever a person is devalued and internalizes the negative judgment of an other\" (Adamson and Clark: 1999, 2-3). I tried to resist this negative evaluation of myself by burying the paper under stacks of school papers in a box as I did not want to see it as a reminder to the wound I had felt. Also, I had hoped that no one would find it even if I had died. Yet, I secretly hoped that one day I would write better, that one day I would no longer feel shame about my writing and that one day, I could remove the paper from the box and laugh. I felt aware that words could cause pain but I never knew that, in university, a place new to me, a place I paid to be in, one I had placed great hope in for a path to a new life, that words could wound me so badly. Suppressed Memory Over the years, I had suppressed the memory of the wound although occasionally the comments would flash across my mind. Then, for a while, the paper, the comments and the wound, seemed to have left me. This forgetting or suppression and remembering of a traumatic event is not uncommon as some \"thoughts or feelings can from a functional point of view become 'forgotten,' or sealed-off, existing as foreign bodies within the rest of that mind's functioning until released 17 intact, perhaps by treatment, perhaps by particular events, or by time itself, years later\" (Garland: 1998a, 13). Still, over the years, I battled with myself, telling 'me' that I could write when I received 'good' grades and comments and then doubting and denying that that I could when the grades were low and the comments were bad or not helpful. However, after taking an expressive writing course, my professor, Guy Allen, asked the class to write on a bad experience in school. Being at OISE as a graduate student amongst so many bright students, I did not want to write on my bad experiences in school, especially about writing. I knew that I had had some bad experiences but I could not remember any specific one. I had internalized my expository writing as deficient, I did not want others to know, or assume at the beginning of my class that I could not write. Instead, I wrote about experiencing writers' block, \"accepting my lot in a long-suffering way\" (Bateman and Holmes:1995,165) as a resistance to change. My resistance to write on a bad experience was also a strategy I had employed to help me 'escape' and 'avoid' (Creamer: 1995, 61) reliving the discomfort of the wounding comment. When Professor Allen asked me what I wrote, I told him that I had many bad experiences but did not want to write on them. Citing W. Reich (1993), Bateman and Holmes (1995) describe this situation of repression and resistance as \"the protection of self-esteem\" (164). Recovered Memory After hearing other students' stories about bad experiences in school, and becoming more confident in the class, I began to recover the memories I had suppressed. In his studies on trauma, Richard J. McNally (2003) finds that after many years of not thinking about the traumatic events, that some people can suddenly remember (219). As the memories emerged, I wanted to tell my story. And, as students disclosed their life stories to each other and began to \"trust each other\" (Berman: 1999, 261) more, I felt safe to tell. I felt I could trust others. 18 For writing to have a therapeutic impact, it must generally be felt to be only for the self or a known and trusted audience. The writer will then feel sufficiently secure and confident to explore and express their deepest feelings and emotions (Bolton: 1999, 225). I found that, close to the end of the school term, the hidden unwanted memories about my writing and TA's comments, buried deep in my memory, resurfaced and haunted me. I had to tell my story to help me remove the weight from my head. Personal writing according to Judith Harris (2003), \"can be a means of creating a stable identity and regaining ego strength lost in crisis of infirmity\" (xv). I knew I had to write my thesis on comments written on my papers by TAs. Patrick Diamond (2003) states that, \"[t]hrough personal experience we come to know and through story, we make it known\" (Syllabus, p. 4). I knew I had to share this experience on comments that TAs wrote on my papers though some people might think that expressive writing, on personal matters in academic settings, might be counterproductive to students' learning. This I find, is the opposite. According to Jeffrey Berman (1999), \"the repudiation of personal writing not only devalues a long and honourable tradition of autobiographical writing but also deprives students of the opportunity for self-discovery\" (251) and learning. Confronting and Resisting Trauma through Expressive Writing I did not understand fully why the TA's comment affected me the way it did. For this reason, I sought to learn more, to understand my Transitional Year Programme (TYP) and undergraduate experience. I wanted to understand why after ten years I still felt ashamed to talk about a comment on a paper. I began an autoethnography\u2014a journey through arts-based inquiry\u2014 a narrative exploration through expressive writing\u2014 delving in my memory bank (Please see methodology.) Jennifer Anne Johnson (2002) writes in her MA thesis that, [t]he associative power of memories is consistent with that of narrative. New experiences can be associated with existing memories and new connection can be made between existing memories, all contributing to the larger narrative of our lives. It follows that the existing 19 narratives in our head, and in our culture, will influence the way we interpret our world as well as the 'stories' we live in the future (26). I wanted to confront and overcome the bad memories, to heal the wound. I felt I no longer needed to hide my past shame. I wanted to make the traumatic experience positive by writing on it to heal myself and to educate and inform others. \"The process of writing leads to nothing less than the reclaiming of self\" (Berman: 1999, 240). In her article on \"African Women and Spirituality... ,\" Njoki Wane (1997) discusses the need to have memories \"enriched and balanced with more positive experiences (136)[where do the quotation marks end?]. I found that by writing this thesis, I am now associating the memories with this new positive feeling of triumph over the wound. I amalso exploring the gaps in research on the topic. This is the TYP dass picture uith me in the second row; second to the left. \u00a5 Wy . Boe oe Ni Ra 20 Chapter 2: Literature Review/Mapping the Terrain To know our audience, to know who listens, we must be in dialogue. We must be speaking with and not just speaking to. In hearing responses, we come to understand whether our words act to rest, to transform, and to move ( hooks: 1989,16). Fitting In In examining language, writing, comments, and trauma induced by TAs' comments, I seek to find literature that will strengthen or support my thesis, in order to continue a dialogue. I also seek the literature to see how my work fits in. On this journey, however, exploring the literature, I find that education researchers, to great extent, have ignored TAs, how they work with their students and how they comment on students' papers. This lack of research on TAs also ultimately leaves a gap in the literature on how TAs view their students' language usage in the writing they present for evaluation. With the lack of research on TAs, researchers have ignored a very crucial element in the students' experience of their post secondary education, and in the results of that experience. By taking this journey, I want my words to \"rest, to transform [and] to move\" as hooks (1989, 16) writes. Scared to Tell Yet, as I journey, I am sometimes afraid to continue to my research as I dig into books in the libraries, search on the Internet and flip pages in journals. If there's no literature on what I'm doing, I say to myself, the negative self-talk, then, no one cares to hear or read about it. My work will be viewed as just a rant, too much complaining not important... Find something academic to do. No one cares about your story. Other times, I tell myself, that if the literature is not there, then I should put it there. I should make others care, even if it's about my life. But, of course, it is not just about my life. In Strangers in Paradise: A aderics from the Working Class by Jake Ryan and Charles 21 Sackrey (1984) and This Place So Far From Hone by Carlos Lee Barney and Carolyn Leste Law (1995), the authors, through self-reflection, discuss some similar themes such as language usage in their post-secondary education\u2014 some of the issues I will raise later. However, these authors did not address negative comments on their papers although they addressed the difficulties in adapting to the academic language. Why have researchers avoided studying TAs and their comments on student papers? Is it because they do not see TAs and the relationships they have with their students as important? Is it because students are too scared or to ashamed, to tell of their traumas with TAs and so the problems disappears? Is it because TAs are seen as unimportant? Or is it because TAs' work and comments are viewed as unimportant? Is it because students fear to tell because they feel they might experience the TAs' and the professors' displeasure? Is it because many students fear admitting that they had written a paper that a professor or a TA said was \"disheartening\" or painful to read. A colleague told me that a professor commented on her paper that he felt disheartened to read her writing. While working on this research, many students were willing to share their papers with me, showing TAs' and professors destructive comments. Some were so wounded by comments they informed me that they had destroyed their papers with wounding comments. Because I have seen destructive comments and heard about them from university students (current and former), I know that there are many students with wounded spirits just struggling to write better for the academy, to prove themselves as good writers in their writing, and to overcome negative assessment and evaluations of their writing. Assessment, Evaluation and Feedback While TA's comments are little studied, there is a wealth of information on feedback, assessment or comments. Brown and Knight (1994), Brown, Bull and Pendlebury, (1997), Dressel 22 (1961) and Boud (1995) all discuss evaluation, the importance of evaluation and how to evaluate. Heenan (1961) discusses the problems in evaluating while Palmer (1961) talks about the disconnection between students and the evaluation of their papers. Louise Maynor and Sandra Vavra (2002) argue that teachers should give comments to help the students to write better rather than to always correct \"errors\" because students disregard comments \"aimed at improving their writing\" (71). Nancy Sommers adds to Maynor and Vavra's arguments by suggesting that students disregard the comments because \"the majority of teacher commentary is hostile and mean-spirited\" (149). Mina Shaughnessy lends support to this position when she says that teachers tend to look at student papers with \"a lawyers' eyes, searching for flaws\" (7). Margaret Christian (2002) writes of the need to offer constructive comments. She suggests offering \"alternative ways to word a sentence and suggestions on fleshing out an idea rather than just writing \"awkward\" or \"develop this thought\" (91). Mary Theresa Hall (2002) gets close to describing or naming the trauma that students experience from negative comments. To avoid negativity in his comments, he states, that he tries to \"write as many helpful suggestions by commenting at length about the good points of the paper... I give helpful suggestions how students can improve both their thinking and writing\" (63). He adds that his comments show seriousness, respect and support for students (70). Although the authors did not address TAs and comments, the literature show that other teachers, full time professors and others, might also require help in the area of commenting. The literature shows that some teachers are aware of their comments on students' papers. But, is the TA always aware? TAs and Teaching Among other duties such as tutoring their students, TAs often engage in marking papers to help reduce professors the workload, especially those with high enrollment in their courses and to enable a timely turnaround of assignments in those courses. TAs are not always trained to do the 23 work assigned to them. As a new TA, myself, I find that I will have to teach and evaluate the best way I know. I will tryto learn more as much as I can about being the 'good enough' teacher and try what I learned in my practice. Nyquist and Wulff (1996) observed TAs for at least seventeen years and concluded that TAs or graduate students \"typically imitate what they have seen teachers and professors do that helped them learn\" (38). This can be problematic because, if the TA models his or her teaching style from a former TA or professor who taught badly, or where approach had a restricted appeal, then he or she may cause problems for certain students. The authors of this study did not focus on TAs' comments on students' papers. A friend informed me that her sister who is a TA is very harsh with her students. This TA claimed that she was treated badly by her TAs when she was an undergraduate student and therefore being in her position, treating her students badly was her revenge. As revenge, it is misdirected\u2014 a displaced hostility. TAs Exposed in the Media In January 2003, The Varsity, a University of Toronto student paper, published an opinion piece written by an undergraduate student named Jericho Kingston (name used). The piece entitled \"Note to T.A.s: Use your powers wisely,\" expressed some the frustration that the student felt in his or her encounters with TAs. Kingston writes: At U of T there is a strange breed of animal which is propagating at an extraordinary rate. It rears its ugly head in almost every discipline: history, biology, philosophy. Its existence is so common it often goes unnoticed. For the most part, it remains docile. That is, until it pounces on its prey, eager for the taste of student blood. Hungry, vicious, unrelenting\u2014 this creature will stop at nothing to achieve its goal. It's called a teaching assistant (a T.A. to those who are familiar) and it is out to get you. ... Most T.A.s make their careers and reputations by being ridiculously difficult markers (Jericho Kingston: 2003). 24 Less than three months later, Patricia DeSales, another undergraduate student at U of T, wrote an article on TAs for The Mike, another student paper at the same university. The article titled, \"In this Land, The TA's Rule,\" raises important questions on the power TAs wield over their students. DeSales holds that, \"[s]tudents loathe the fact that T.A.'s have so much power, and they're not even professors yet\" (DeSales: 2003). To confirm my claim that some TAs might require training (in different areas), seven months after DeSalles opinion piece, The Globe and Mail published their second annual University Report Card that ranked the quality of U of T's TAs at \"34\", 35\" and 36\" out of 38\" (Chapnick: 2003, 13). This only applies to TAs at U of T and it may have nothing to do with simply getting training (most TAs get some), but with the sort of training offered and the way the TAs use it. The report also seems to confirm the issues raised by Jericho and DeSalles about the power of TAs and their lack of concern for students. A month after The Globe and Mail published its findings on TAs at U of T, Adam Chapnick (2003), a PhD candidate and also a director for the teaching assistants' training program at U of T, responded to the report in the commentary section of The Bulletin, another U of T publication. Chapnick expresses his dismay about the findings by The Globe and Mail saying that he was \"not entirely comfortable\" (13). Chapnick shows all the innovative work that the TA training center has been offering TAs, the \"increasing [student] attendance\" at the workshops. Based on this evidence he declares \"that TAs care as well\" (13) and he asks \"why do the perception of students remain so negative?\" (13). There are some probable answers to Chapnick's question. One is that, Chapnick's use of \"increasing number\" does not give any definite data about how many TAs work at U of T and how many from that number take the training courses. Therefore, it is not clear how many of U of T's TAs receive training from the centre. Currently, of ten TAs I know at U of T, only two have taken any form of training. As the training is not compulsory, most TAs do not see any need to take time 25 from their school work to go for training. Also, their course and work schedule might not be compatible with the times that the training centre provides the training. A second likely answer, is that there are some TAs who do not care about becoming professors after completion of their graduate degrees. They may not be interested in perfecting their teaching skill. (This is much more likely to be the case in the sciences or certain social sciences than in the humanities). According to Timothy B. Gravelle, Phd student, \"we may or may not be aiming at becoming a professor, but either way, working as a TA is transitory\"(2003: 5). A third probable answer is, as I have concluded from Craig Nathanson's (2003) response to Kingston, is the \"simple fact that most TAs are TAs only because they earn money while in graduate school\" by doing the work (Nathanson: 2003, 5 - TA at UofT). A final reasonable answer is that some TAs do not see the importance of performing to the best of their abilities. After all, there was no incentive prior to 2002 for them to perform at their best. However, the TA training program at U of T now offers three awards each year, one for each campus\u2014 St George, Scarborough and Erindale (Chapnick: 2003, 13). I hope that the new incentive will make TAs who write bad comments, more mindful of the comments they write in evaluating students' writing. Departments and the Training of TAs The training of TAs vary from one department to another and from one supervisor to another. Some departments provide their students with training. As far back as the 1980's Professor Frederick Case, then the chair for the Department of French Studies at U of T, and a qualified teacher, held a few seminars for TAs or observed the TAs (twice per year) at work in that department. This was extra work that he committed himself to, but a necessary one as he claimed \"for the good of the students.\" Later, Professor Case would interview the TAs and then provide a written evaluation of the TAs' teaching performance (Case: 2004, conversation). Some other 26 departments at U of T now provide similar services for TAs. For example, the supervisor or teacher may teach a few classes (up to three in most cases) at the beginning of a school term while allowing the TA to observe his or her teaching. In general, departments often do not have the budget to provide more training for TAs and for this reason among others. Most departments concentrate on 'in-class' teaching rather than on other areas of TAs' relationship with their students. There are numerous books on what TAs can do with and for their students, but books do not teach how to comment. The training on how TAs should or could comment on student's papers is overlooked. Departments could hold practice sessions, showing TAs good samples of comments while allowing TAs to prepare their own comments to a different students' writing. TAs their Perceptions and Students' Trauma In my third year as an undergraduate, one TA told me that his students did not know how to write. Automatically, I thought about myself. All the papers I presented to him in my second year were well edited so I knew he was not talking about me. I then asked the TA if he had forgotten when he first started university and if he was comparing his writing after completing his BA, MA and almost four years of Ph.D. with an undergraduate in first year. I said, think about yourself, when you were there. He said I had a point and he would think about that next time he was marking a student's paper. I guess my resistance against the injustice of unfair evaluation done to me and to other students started a long time ago, before I was aware of what I was doing. Nyquist and Wulff (1996) argue that, some \"TAs often have difficulty in accommodating students who learn in other ways\" (38). Of course there are wonderful, compassionate, and capable TAs who care about their students' learning. There are TAs too who comment well on their students' papers but a \"few bad apples\" are all that is needed to push some students out of the academic system, cause them trauma or wound the very spirit they need to write well. Many students drop out of university 27 in their first year; I wonder how many do so at least in part because they experienced trauma or spiritual wounds due to negative comments on their papers. Trauma and Spirituality\u2014 The Case of the Student Trauma takes different forms, physical and non-physical (Steerman: 2003). My trauma was non-physical\u2014 it was a wound to my spirit. George Dei (2003) states that, \"spirituality [among other things] is also about understanding and maintaining a balance\u2014 body mind and soul\" (4). John Bradshaw details the spiritual wound he felt when a teacher handed him back a paper. I remember the first essay I wrote at a university; it came back with this big red cross across it and the phrase Wads of hogwash. And even if the teacher had explained why, [it would have been] a distraction of energy; it was not energy being used well for my creative project. Wads of hogwash is just shaming. I remember that I grabbed the paper; I remember turning it over. I didn't want anyone else to see it. And it certainly doesn't give you the permission to keep creating... . But that professor certainly did not help or empower me in spiritual empowerment; he curtailed me... . After that, I just never said anything that the text wouldn't say and stayed very conservative and very frightened of him and his criticism. And I did okay, but in a sense, not my own stuff; I went to a lot of critics. That... throws you back into a very conservative codependence\" (Foehr: 1997. 56). Another student (Natalie) writes of a similar sentence that shows that even a single word can wound the spirit. I'll never forget the anger that welled in my belly and the blood that rushed to my face when I received that paper back, that paper which I perceived to be one of my best, and saw where the instructor had written \"So\" out beside one of my sentences. So? Can you believe that\" (Vanderslice: 2002, 84). Yet another student (Brandi) writes how she felt when she read the comments or response on her paper. Having someone read my work was terrifying, and the thought of their [sic] response was almost enough to me bolt through the closest escape route (Vanderslice: 2002, 84) . 28 This wounding of the spirit takes place on a daily basis in the academy yet it is ignored. Teachers wield so much power over their students and there is no policy to protect students from such practices. L%3 yi ie x Cfpreysth: M 'Just as your family means @ lot to you, Henderson, power means a lot to me. (New Yorker 2004, 136) Academics and Spirituality The disconnection between the spirit and academic work and practices is evident in the teachers' commentaries. Teachers need to feel more and to acknowledge that students also feel. This disconnection between teachers and students emanates from the university's focus on \"the development of the cognitive capacities of their students\" and the \"fostering of intellectual learning\" 29 than the \"nurturing of the affective or emotional side of the student\u2014 love, empathy [and] awareness\" (Lyon: 1971, 18). Educators should see the strength in connecting the spirit as part of the academic process. Thomas Moore (1997) explains some of the feelings that many in the academy feels when the spirituality is mentioned. He states: For many of us (until recently, this writer included), when we hear the word spiritual in academic settings (we would never say it, of course), our muscles tighten, our bodies become tense, and we squirm in discomfort; we don' t know what to expect or how to respond. In short, we are afraid (Foehr: 1997, 45). Because instructors are afraid to talk about the spirit, they fail to see and acknowledge the wounds that many students have. Perhaps this is one reason why instructors may be clueless about the impact of comments. Many students need time to recover after a bad comment but they do not express their spiritual wound to anyone. I wonder if they believe that others may view them as weak and unable to withstand the macho side of the patriarchal culture that is embedded in the academy. According to Watkinson (1997), [e]ducational institutions are designed as oppressive bureaucracies devoid of interconnectedness and caring. Educational leadership is militaristic, macho, and looking fora fight. Traditional pedagogy, weighed down by organizational structure and leadership, is caught in the lamentable paradox of teaching democratic principles, the sine qua non of upholding human dignity, but practicing almost none (5). The dominating perception among academics is that good students must fight and stay strong on the academic battlefield and that they should not show signs of weakness, over- sensitivity or weak coping skills. I had feared talking to my colleagues about my difficulties with writing because I feared they would tell me I was as not prepared for the academic fight. Now, years later, I find that many of my colleagues and others I have recently met, suffered shame and fear about their writing and comments on their papers. When I told other students about my research, many were willing to share their papers with negative 30 comments with me and some even gave me copies of their papers with wounding comments. Some of the papers were marked by professors and some by TAs. Predictably, the majority of these students, with wounded spirits as a result of the comments, did not tell anyone and often did not challenge the markers about the comments though some challenged their marks. A broken or wounded spirit stifles students' academic growth. Yet, spirit or spirituality is \"not a topic easily woven into an academic framework\" (Wane: 1997, 35). Some instructors might fear the use of spirituality in the academy because of its association with religion. This association brings unease among those who do not want to bring religion into their teaching practices. For some, \"religion and spirituality is one and the same\" (Shahjahan: 2004, 90). Even if spirituality \"derived from religions\" (Shahjahan: 2004, 91) or is the same, I believe that it should not hinder instructors, academics or decision makers in academic institutions from acknowledging and incorporating it into the academy. \"Spiritual people can either be religious or non-religious and, similarly, religious people can be either spiritual or non-spiritual\" (London-Alben: 1998). For me, spirituality is a way of being and feeling that involves my personal connection with the universe (ecologically, socially, educationally...). Religion, on the other hand, has an hierarchical structure and among other things, a 'ritual process of exclusion\" (Case : 2004, conversation). I feel because I am (spirit). The spirituality I am advocating in this thesis is one that is personal and therefore not hierarchical or exclusive. Whether or not spirituality originated from religion, I believe I can function spiritually without being religious and I think we must acknowledge the extent of trauma in the academy and its effect on students' spirituality. Perhaps we need see beyond religion, to factor in emotion to connect our feelings that connects to spirit, allowing us to feel for students and to theorize their experiences in the academy. 31 Chapter 3: Theoretical/Discursive Framework Story and Theory We tell stories to illuminate the paths we travel and to share humour, courage and wisdom in this liberation struggle. Our story is our theorizing... (James: 1993, 31). I want to tell my story, as James states, as my way of theorizing my experience as a pre- university and undergraduate student struggling to grasp and employ the academic language in my writing after experiencing trauma from TAs' written comments. A theory is an attempt to explain, by giving causes or reasons, something that happened. Theory is not static: you can refute, modify or test it. I want to explain the causes or reasons why I experienced trauma from the comments. In writing her Ph.D. thesis on breast cancer, Nancy Davis- Halifax (2002) argues that \"[t]he ideas and methods of theory are personally troubling\" (16); she adds that what both theory and her experience say \"are at odds with each other\" (16), Davis-Halifax explains the dilemma between theory and perception, noting that while theory is a \"response to the world\" that \"helps to organize perceptions\" (16), it could also \"construct the intent of our perception\" (16). Davis- Halifax indicates that theory had placed interpretive restraints on her perceptions. She, however, assures us that theory can also \"provide a useful set of ideas and reference points against which we can evaluate perception\" (16). Like her, I do not want my experience to been seen only through someone else's canon. I need to see and theorize for myself. Advancing Theory In view of that, I am somewhat reluctant to employ theory in this thesis. But I will. \"Theories produced by, for and on behalf of Black women become vitally important in resisting oppression in the academy\" (Wane: 2002, 184). My aim is that theory will provide the necessary ideas to guide me in interpreting my experience. I should decide what theory is important, in 32 addition to asking when and if theory is useful (Halifax-Davis: 2000, 17). I hope theory will help me to me to critically analyze social and institutional practices that may have impeded or facilitated my progress as a Black working-class student entering the academy and writing my papers. I hope theory will offer meaning to my undergraduate academic experience and help me to see beyond the personal, Finally, I hope other theories will help me develop my own theories about the academy and myself. Certainly, no single theory can fully encompass or capture the experiences of people. Often, however, as researchers we use one or more theories for a number of reasons. This could be to focus and delve deeper or to extend the theory based on new experience or because the theory might support all that the researcher wants to say. Although there are many theories that run throughout this work, I decided to select the theoretical or discursive standpoint\u2014 discourse community I locate this thesis within the framework of discourse community theory. I hope the discourse community as a theory will \"reflect [my] research objectives, and illustrate and develop the strongest explanatory model\" (Thomas-Long: 2001, 31) for my experience writing papers within the academic community. Citing Romero, Alan Ovens (2002) defines discamse as interweaving \"language action and identity in a way that engages and connects its participants, both immediately and over time and place, to give a sense of coherence and common purpose to a community\" (506). Discourse brings awareness to what is important in what one does. On the other hand, Ovens states that conmumity applies to \"an association of individuals sharing and creating ways of interpreting their experiences, that builds a particular identity connecting individuals and groups reinforcing their common issues without effacing their differences\" (506). Ovens states how community connects to discourse because \"it refers to a localised time, space and membership as the context for the expression and production of discourse. Community gives to discourse a human face' and recognises that discourses are expressed through human interaction\" (506). 33 Discourse Community Together, discourse and community\u2014 now discourse community\u2014 provide the best theory to help me advance my research in relation to writing papers as a form of written communication. According to Erik Borg (2003), we communicate using language with a person or a collection of people in a discourse community (398). This collection of people, by choice, become members of the discourse community by \"collective practices\" (Ovens: 2002, 506). By choice, for example, I entered the university, thus becoming a member of the academic community. Among other tasks, I knew I had to write papers and answer exam questions, but I did not know all practices used in the community at the outset\u2014 for example, that my language usage in my writing had to be a certain way. Students do not always know all the practices in the university's community at the outset; yet, like me, they become members. In the university, for example, standard English language skills in writing is one of the traditions. I later realized that I had to learn how to write in standard English, often using jargon, to be truly accepted as a member of the discourse community. According to Ovens (2003), as \"a concept, discourse community reinforces the social nature of knowledge production,\" a way of knowing or transferring knowledge. Discourse community theory helps to guide and provide a deeper understanding of my experience. As I entered the university, I entered into a new community that had established codes of behaviour and language, among other expectations. I quickly realized that the discourse used was new to me, I could not resist joining in unless I did not want to successfully accomplish my academic goals. The \"imposition of a unified discourse\" (Heller and Martin-Jones: 2001, 7) in the academic community, at the outset, seemed to exclude me. The alienation I felt, the cultural change I experienced and the learning of a new language\u2014 including the jargon\u2014 overwhelmed me. Bartholomae (2004) writes that, 34 students will not take on our peculiar way of reading, writing, speaking, and thinking all at once... . Our colleges and universities, by and large, have failed to involve basic writing students in scholarly projects, projects that would allow them to act as though they were colleagues in an academic enterprise. Much of the written work students do is test taking, report or summary, work that places them outside the working discourse of the academic community, where they are expected to admire and report on what we do, rather than inside that discourse, where they can do its work and participate in a common enterprise (1). I had to fit in. Discourse community theory helps me to come to an awareness about how I belonged or connected as a new member to the academic community. I am slowly becoming aware that \"[w]hat we say, what we do, and the sense we and others make of our words and deeds mark us as members of a community\" (Lemke: 1995, 19). The evidence of my exclusion appeared in subtle ways, such as through the power of language on papers\u2014 papers I wrote and the comments I received. (Please see the actertiserent below\u2014 the messages that help to feed into one's self of inadequacy) GOOD ENGLISH gives you Cenfidence sess \u00ab Haw you can gain pots \u2014\u2014 develop your poersondatity \u2014 \u2014 gehieve SUCCESS | - se wth Re yest we tee fe \u00ab wee Soe eival. eae me dT oe foe nh ee 8.

By using both words, I refer both to the words I used to convey meaning in my papers, and to the way I used them based on my ability at the outset of and during my undergraduate writing experience. Language plays a powerful role in our everyday lives. In the academy, written language plays an even stronger role for students, especially those in the social sciences. Students need to display \"effective\" written language to communicate to their teachers their understanding of a subject when they write an essay or answer exam questions. I had not given much thought to what university would have been like before entering. I only knew it would be different. According to Lester Faigley (1992), the university was described as an unfamiliar discourse community that students seek to enter\u2014a notion that provided an alternative to the explanation of cognitive deficiency for students judged to be poor writers. Rather than being assessed as lacking in certain cognitive processes, student came to be viewed as foreigners in an established discourse community, and the writing teacher's job was reinterpreted as a guide to the customs and conventions of that community (33). While one of my teachers felt the need to guide me into the new culture within the academic community, I felt I was losing a part of myself. I now acknowledge that many important details of the life I lived before university have been erased. I'm not the same student who started taking university courses eleven years ago. Moving from a factory to a university helped to forge a new identity\u2014 from a factory worker I became a university student. At times, I felt the urge to defend aspects of myself\u2014 my self-esteem, my mother tongue and my spirit (the way I feel, my emotional make-up)\u2014 to survive. Yet, the need to change my career and the need to become more educated overpowered my non-academic self. Because I used the words I spoke before entering university less and less, and adapted to more and more of the university language, I have forgotten some of the ways I spoke before I entered university. As a result, I struggle to live in two communities\u2014 the one at home and the one at 36 school. At home, I try to deny the academic part of me, to rid myself of the jargon I acquired that sometimes forces itself from my mouth. At school, I strive every day to blend or to convert more and more into the academic world, to understand and be understood. My attempted conversion into the new community gave me the feeling that I was a different person, not my true self. This conversion into the academic world led to a rebirth or the birth of the \"academic other.\" According to Paulo Freire (1971), \"[c]onversion to the people requires a profound rebirth. Those who undergo it must take on a new form of existence; they can no longer remain as they were\" (47). This conversion, of course, affected my spirit. When I did not feel real or authentic, when I had to resist using my mother tongue in order to assume the role of the \"right\" community member, my spirit was never at peace. I know that a \"student cannot begin to change his world until he understands it and comes to a distinct interpretation of it\" (Worrell: 1998, 1). Reflecting on my experiences in the academy, I am now making sense of my world and myself. Coming from a working-class background and from another country where I did not use \"standard\" English in the home, exacerbated my inability to write in the academic manner. (Please see the picture below, it represents how I felt\u2014 all that I had to learn\u2014 like weight on my head.) This is not to imply that many students from working-class backgrounds or from other countries where English might be their second language do not have a strong command of writing standard English or the language of the academy. Patricia Bizzell (1997) states that an \"individual can belong to more than one discourse community, but her access to the various communities will be unequally conditioned by her social situation\" (365). It has been difficult for me to adjust to the conventions of academic writing, to its distinctive way of \"putting together individual words with established meanings in order to make new meanings. Stringing them together and remembering their arrangement produces syntax\" (Brand: 2000). \"In order to communicate effectively, educators... must understand the structural conditions in which the thought and language of the people are 37 dialectically framed\" (Freire: 1971, 85-86). My adjustment in the discourse community of the university was challenging. The discourse was already established, with agents (teachers) who were sometimes unwilling to accommodate a new member. (Please see the picture below it represents the feeling that many people suffer, as if they carry a tremendous weight on their heads.) (Unixersity of Toronto Magazine, Vd 31. Na 1. p. 53. 2003) 38 Chapter 4: Method and Methodology Narrative as Data Narrative inquiry implies that I not only accept \"stories\" as a valid source of data, but that I embrace narrative thinking and writing as a scholarly model... Unlike empiricist reasoning that seeks to prove hypotheses, narrative inquiry seeks to probe, interpret, and present phenomena embedded in the inherently complex, variable, and socially-constructed reality of human experience where generalization is often neither possible nor desirable. Instead of generalizability, narrative inquiry offers vicarious experiences that prompt researchers and practitioners to build theories and principles as necessary to address practicalities (Mason: 2004). Before I delve into the heart of the thesis, the soul of the narrative that breathes life into this story, I will explain my method (the way I do this work) and my zthadology (how I gathered my information and the techniques I used to analyze it) including my reasons for utilizing the approach I have chosen, Narrative as data is just as valid as interviewing people or researching other people's lives. In the end, we obtain a narrative of experiences where the researcher can, as Mason states, 'interpret' or build on theories; it does not matter whether it is a single person or a group of people who provide the data for the case study. Single Explanatory Case Study This is a single case study, meaning a \"detailed analysis of a single example of some phenomenon,\" or \"a commitment to examine a single case at length, and often with multiple sources of information\" (Krahn: 1994, 289). In this thesis, I focus on my experience as an undergraduate student, writing papers and receiving comments mainly from TAs. I employ a variety of techniques and data such as storytelling and use of memory. This case study is explanatory, \"seeking to pinpoint why something happened\" (Krahn: 1994, 289). In the case of comments on my papers, I wanted to know the causes especially the causes for the comments that traumatized me. I raise two important questions: one, what caused 39 the TAs to write the wounding comments; and, two, what caused me to experience trauma from the comments? The two matters are very different. I approached the first question by understanding my entry point into the academic community, paying attention to my language usage in writing my papers. Did my language usage or writing ability cause the TAs to write negative comments? The answer is yes based on the comments on my papers. For the second question, I concede that the language or words TAs used in their commentaries were harsh, wounding or hurtful and consequently, caused me trauma. The significance of trauma students experience from comments and the discourse from which it originates are understood as a phenomenon of university life that has social and psychological implications. I understand, all too well, how this phenomenon affects students. This research project also seeks to find the meaning behind the markers' comments. It aims to identify the impact and consequences of the comments. \"Researchers using qualitative methods place far more emphasis on the meaning behind individual's action, and try to understand why people act as they do\" (Krahn: 1994, 284). I have the opportunity to understand my actions before and after I received the comments. I can understand how I wrote my papers and under what conditions I did so. In addition, I can understand why I became traumatized by the comments. \"Expressing thoughts and feeling about a massive upheaval enables people to learn more bout the event and their own reactions to it, and the way in which it is represented in the memory\" (Bolton: 1999, 199). For now, (for reasons explained below) I am unable to understand why some TAs evaluate the way they do. But, my aim is not to know why the TAs wrote hurtful comments (that could be another study). I did not interview TAs or the ones who wrote the comments on my paper, neither did I find sources that provided me with information to come to any kind of conclusion. This study about finding meaning to my experience in the TYP and my undergraduate 40 study as a healing process and a way for me to discover myself and the challenges of dealing with comments on my paper. Qualitative- Arts Based Narrative Inquiry I employ an arts based narrative inquiry approach because arts-based inquiry \"offers a way of contacting and fine-tuning what we are seeing, feeling, and imagining. We can orchestrate these perceptions into clusters, which are then available to be framed and played...\" and it \"... helps us to enter into a wider world of multiple and moving meanings. Such inquiry helps us escape from the ensnarement of traditional, one-point perspective\" (Mullen; Diamond; Beattie; Kealy: 1999, 347). Arts \"exploits the power of form to inform\" (Eisner: 1981, 7). Narrative Inquiry \"is a process that imposes meaning on experience and on methods used to study it\" Diamond and Mullen:1999, 259 cites Connelly & Clandinin: 1990). Mason states that, those \"of us who want to use marrative inquiry as a scholarly model have got to be prepared to defend our position. Narrative inquiry is radical and \"alternative\" even within qualitative research\" (Mason: 2003, 1). Qualitative arts-based narrative research deepens our understanding of \"the experience of self and [or] others\" (Marshall: 1995, 44). For me, it helps to explore life's challenges, extending into different areas of life, providing the necessary tools such as knowledge and growth for one to survive. Creative Autoethnography My creative autoethnography gives a story within a story, as you will note later how chapter five deviates from the rest of a thesis that already deviates from the traditional form of academic writing. Through data collected with and from myself, the memories and other sources I employ in this thesis comprise an autoethnography. 4] The term \"autoethnography\" in this context is defined as a theoretically-informed and data- driven examination of the researchers' own literacy experience or development in larger sociohistoric contexts. It is more than just an autobiographical account, although the researchers' critical self-reflection is an important source of data. Data for autoethnography come from a wide range of sources... (Matsuda: 2004, 11). Ethnography, is \"the study of people in their natural settings,\" (Bowling: 1997). I have also included the creative side of the journey by adding my poetry. Creativity, according to Robert Paul Weiner (2000), \"is our movement toward the beyond,\" (254) toward a deeper sense of the self and the universe. By digging deep within myself through a creative spiritual process, I am able to focus on wounding comments and show how they affected my spirit, yet I am also able to demonstrate how positive comments have boosted my self-esteem and given new hope to my injured spint. Metaphor In order to place the comments on my paper in context, I gave the events or situations that led to the comments. For example, I address my writing habits, unedited work, rushed papers and limited knowledge of the standards for writing good academic papers. Marshall states that, \"., research should be conducted in the setting where all the contextual variables are operating (Marshall: 1995). In addition to placing my comments in the context in which they originated, I also use the metaphor of war or battlefield. Metaphors help to transfer ideas to make a comparison and to facilitate meaning, feeling and emotion. By using the word \"war\" or battlefield, my aim is to show how I felt. I experienced the academy as if it were a battlefield in which I had a soldier's ignorance of the territory, and inadequate preparation. War refers to the confusion I felt at times, to the hostility, conflicts and struggles I felt in the academy. War also refers to the victories or successes I had during my studies. 42 Data Collection For data, I first searched my memory bank. The memories were not hard to locate. They came back, the memories\u2014 traumatic and non-traumatic, , giving me a large piece of my research material, helping me to organize personal experience with theory. I understand trauma and I know that many people never forget traumatic experiences although they might suppress them. \"Only when we are confident that we understand everyday memory can we determine whether memory for trauma requires distinct explanatory mechanisms\" (Creamer: 2003, 27). For this research, the memories of the places and occasions where the trauma occurred, stayed with me even when I thought they were gone. The pain and trauma, I felt at the beginning of this research were as vivid and painful as the days I experienced them. \"Whether or not the mechanisms of traumatic memory differ from those of ordinary memory, and whether the differences are more important than the similarities, can only be determined by research\" (Creamer: 2003, 27). Also, I now vividly remember the places and occasions when I received good comments and how felt. \"When we remember an event from our past, we reconstruct it from encoded elements distributed throughout the brain (McNally: 2003. 35). Then, for more data, I searched for my old papers\u2014 some of those undergraduate papers that, for a while, I hid with shame and fear. I selected seven papers with the aim of making sure that the comments on them would address the key questions I raised. Graham cites Butt and Raymond that, \"autobiographical research still \"remains controversial in the light of the nature of the research process and data\" because it reveals \"personal bias\" (Graham: 1991, 113). While this is a valid concern, forms of bias appear in varying degrees within all research methodologies. I wanted to make sure that the comments from the papers would address the questions raised in this explanatory study. Later, I extracted the comments that formed the basis for the story in Chapter 5. 43 By interweaving, memories, comments and theories by other scholars, I have opened up \"academic discourse to include interiority and the \"I' without promoting or appearing to promote self-absorption\" (Mason: 2003). The comments offer insight into my language use in my writing and the issue of trauma in the academy. They also allow for the integration of my feelings in my story. Most importantly, the comments highlight the need for change in policy and practice in how the academy treats its students. Limitation In all studies, there are limitations and gaps since one person cannot write on everything. To do so would require volumes. Moreover, even in volumes, because we all think differently, the one who wrote the volumes, is still bound to miss something. Each researcher adds to create the whole by building on each other's work. As researchers, we work as separate entities, but together as a whole, to connect the missing parts in the 'web of life'. I believe that, since I obtained the bulk of the comments on my own papers from TAs, if I had interviewed a group of them, their input would have made this study more interesting. However, due to time constraints to complete the thesis and the emphasis on my experience (\"self\"), I chose to concentrate on their comments on my papers. The limitation in taking the comments without interviewing TAs is that, I am not able to understand why they write the comments they do. Nevertheless, the absence of TAs' voices in this research, leaves room for others to take on that challenge, for this area of work that badly needs research. Another limitation is that this a single case study. It draws only on my experience and not on that of other students. However, I have supported the study with corroboration taken from the studies of other scholars. A final limitation, in this study is that it is confined to one geographical location (Toronto). In spite of this, throughout my investigation for this study, examining other cases, I found that TAs, and professors all over the globe, have the potential and do engage in 44 writing wounding comments. (Please see the comments at the beginning of the thesis). However, the problem of writing wounding comments could probably be addressed with a new policy for TAs\u2014 one that trains them on involving emotion or spirit in their evaluation of students' papers. Ethics I did not use the names of people involved in this study if I felt he or she would offended if I had mentioned their names. I used only the names of people who, I believe might not be offended by my use of their names. I also did not state course codes in order to protect the persons who taught the courses or the TAs who worked with the students. I did this study, using this data because I sense that in order for me to carry on with any further studies on TAs, and to work as a new TA, I must heal my wounds first by searching myself and sharing my story. I would not like to walk into a classroom and treat students the way I was treated. I want to treat students with the dignity they deserve, after all they pay tuition to gain knowledge, not to be hurt or abused. Overall, I believe I must come to terms with my past and understand myself before I try to understand others. That is a personal undertaking, but as hooks (1994) states as the personal is political. I agree with her that allowing my voice to be heard is one way of healing the wounds (9). Telling my story is a healing process. Writing my story, of being in the academy is not complete, I agree with Jennifer Ann Johnson (2002) that stories are \"able to transcend the trivial and capture what is fundamental, or what is implied by the situation. Within the story the whole is represented\" (23). Before I take you to the story, I share my poem\u2014 a prayer\u2014 asking for strength from a higher power to help me with my battles in academic life and to successfully complete my undergraduate academic journey. 45 Give Me Strength Higher Power, give me the strength and confidence To stay alive on this journey on this battle field To fight when I should To walk away when I should To know my enemies To know my friends Keep me safe from harm From minefields and all the dangers here Let me accomplish my missions (Clarke, 2003) The poem informs you of what is about to come, but I will share an image with you, one I believe captures my feeling on the battlefield but I will deliver my experience in the form of a written story. H 0 T H p 0 t \u00a2 1 46 46 47 Chpter 5: The War/ Battlefield Stories Most of all we require story, and we must overcome the idea that story is some frivolous or childish entertainment that distracts us from the serious business of, say, making money. We are biologically driven to function in the story mode (Gold: 2002, 46). Joseph Gold reminds us of the importance of the story. Stories whether written or oral have been told all over the world to uphold traditions or to teach valuable lessons. The aim of my story\u2014a series of vignettes\u2014 is to highlight some of the problems that I encountered in university. It is also to help educate. I use the war or battlefield metaphor to show the impact of words, their role in the struggle that exists overtly and covertly between teachers and me. The story captures the challenges and the survival tactics that I employed in my TYP and undergraduate journey. Most importantly, the story is not just about me but could be that of many other students who must bear the brunt of words that teachers utter or write. Back to School \"I'm going back to school,\" I tell my friend Denise. We Dropout is defined as leaving school before graduating for . have the same name. Denise emigrated from Ghana (1986) any reason other than death - (Kronick: 1998, 84). - two years after I emigrated from Jamaica to Canada. We both dropped out of high school in Toronto after we arrived Current harsh economic in Toronto. I dropped out because my mother broke her realities mean that students | who find jobs want tohangon = _ kneecap and I had to take care of myself by working every to them and continue to work . while going to school (Dei: evening after school. My grades were bad and I felt tired 1995, 136). The issue of poverty impacts significantly on the educational success of students as they negotiate between satisfying immediate economic survival needs and receiving an education that has no immediate or apparent material gratification (Dei: 1995, 136). The TYP began as a vehicle to provide post-secondary education to a group of young adults whose education had been disrupted through immigration to Canada (Wayne: 2003, xv). This access program is a one- year, full-time course of studies leading to admission in an Arts and Science degree program. The Transitional Year Programme consists of one full course and eight half-courses. The full course is an option course selected by the students from a number of introductory courses offered by the Faculty of \u2014 Arts and Science (Antone: 2003, 173). Many of the... [TYP] students have children (Ferris: 1992, 18), 48 every morning. \"They accepted me in that program for people who dropped out of high school because of personal or money problems.\" \"I've never heard of anyone who didn't finish grade thirteen going to university,\" Denise replies. \"There's a program. The Transitional Year Programme (TYP) and I'm going. You should come too.\" Denise and I attended the same high school before we both dropped out. She completed grade ten. I completed grade eleven. We remain friends. She worked at Wendy's, a fast food restaurant where she made burgers and prepared salads while I worked at Consumer's Glass, a factory where I checked bottles for defects and packed the good ones in boxes. \"Well, I'm going to university. I always wanted to go. Look, I was laid off one month before Danier was born. Danier is almost one year and they still haven't called me back. They've never laid me off for this long. I don't think they're going to call me back.\" \"You just don't know,\" Denise says. The Transitional Year Program is a university access program for students with high academic potential and strong motivation who lack the formal background, skills, and confidence to qualify for university admission. The program has its roots in the Black community in Toronto. It emerged out of two community summer programs in 1969 and 1970, which prepared a small number of \"educationally disadvantaged\" Black, Aboriginal, and working-class students to enter university. It has since expanded to a full-year, full-time program... (Abramovitch: 2003, 93).

The TYP is intended to serve an academically and socially integrative function for TYP students. They are gradually brought up to the appropriate academic level, and familiarized with the difficulty of the undergraduate curriculum through exposure Ferris: 1992, 16). 49 TYP and University\u2014Transition to a New Community I leave my factory job behind and enroll in the pre- university program, a place I will call the battlefield because I know I will have to fight. I am not fully prepared\u2014 is anyone ever truly ready for anything?\u2014 but I'm ready because I want to learn and I have my culture and past experiences to help me. I want to graduate from university. I've never graduated from anything. I will be the first in my family of seven children. I fear that I won't survive. For school, I pack the ammunition that ] bought at the store into my backpack. My pens, highlighters, Oxford Dictionary of Current E nglish, Collins E nelish Thesaurus and all kinds of books\u2014 from Kan Marx's Commumist Manifesto to Chinua Achebe,s Things Fall A part, John King Fairbank's The United States and hina, L.

My backpack is heavier than the boxes I had packed with bottles and removed from the assembly line at Consumers' Glass. Look at those students, my colleagues or soldiers I will call them. Some seem younger and stronger. Some wear eyeglasses and some carry big backpacks. Even some of the By the time students enter college or university the influence of their school experience is largely irreversible, and there is evidence that some wastage [dropout or failure] occurs because of the poor preparation they have received in school (Miller: 1972, 239). As a student, terror silenced me in the classroom. Textbooks, professors, and other students spoke a language foreign to me, even more foreign than English. Their words claimed a power over me because | could not interpret, understand, communicate, or analyze their logic. It was an academic language, complex coded intellectualism, of privilege (Chavira-Prado: 1999, 135). We believe there is a natural tendency for people to learn and that learning will flourish if nourishing, encouraging environment is provided (Slotnick et. al: 1993). TYP is a program that understands and caters to the academic needs of students 50 older ones seem stronger too, they march past me into big buildings and classrooms as big as a soccer fields. They all appear ready for battle. There are big libraries - Robarts, with books that dazzle my eyes. Excited, I take many books - too many to carry in my hands - old books on the slave trade - some seem too complicated for me to understand. Questions race through my mind. Can I do it? Should I continue? What if I fail? Am I fooling myself? I struggle to pronounce and understand words\u2014 new words I learn almost every day. A bunch of 'isms' and some others words. Marxism, I don't have a clue. Mercantilism, maybe merchants and something about selling and buying. Colonialism, I know a little bit about it, I was born in Jamaica and it was colonized. Imperialism, I know about Britain's history of going into Africa and taking over. Bou -bou\u2014 gei --, bourgeoisie, I can't pronounce it. I will keep listening to how some of my allies pronounce it until I can. Thesaurus - at first I thought it had something to do with dinosaurs. Syllabus sounded like it was related to syllable. Periphery I wonder what it is - the edge of something? \"I have to learn so many new words,\" I say to Hartford an instructor and one of my mentors who works at the TYP. from disadvantaged backgrounds who have not been prepared for the traditional route into university (Gibba: 2003, 135). If students want to become affiliated with academic discourse communities, oreven if they want to succeed in Lo school, they may have tomake considerable sacrifices. To become active academic participants, they sometimes must make major trade-offs that can create personal and social distance between them and their families and communities. Students are asked to modify their language to fit that of the academic classroom or discipline. They must drop, or at least diminish in importance, their affiliations to their home cultures in order to take on the values, language, and genres of their disciplinary culture (Ann M. Johnson: 1997, 65). 51 And he assures me that I have to learn them to fit it. \"I have to learn a lot of words,\" I say again to Agi, another instructor at TYP\u2014 another mentor. \"I have to do a lot of learning. How come I don't know these words?\" \"Well, where you're coming from you didn't really need them. So there was no need for you to learn them.\" \"There's just so much to learn,\" I say. I walk from her office and sit in the lounge and remember. I remember the words of one of my Italian co- workers at Consumer' Glass. \"You young girl, why you work here? You go to school. No stay here. You too young.\" I remember Denise's words when I told her I was going to the TYP, \"My brain isn't strong enough for university,\" she said. Growing up, my family always told me that I was bright and I believed in them. Denise did not have that support. Abandoned by her mother and her father who lived in Canada, her grandparents raised her. Denise did not always receive the educational support she needed. I remember my mother's words, in her Jamaican voice when I told her. \"Can you do it?\" she asked. I remember Gail's words, my other friend who was in my grade ten English class and who wrote a reference letter [Maxims of clarity push the student writer \"toward the language that most nearly reproduces immediate experience and away from the language that might be used to understand it, transform it, and relate it to everything else (Faigley: 1992, 34) . ...| learned to follow all of the rules about writing well... very well.... but | always saw it as superficial, mechanical, empty, and so not me (Buttignol: 1998, 18).

First Mission\u2014Writing the Paper oe My first major mission at the TYP level is a four-page position paper on underdevelopment and the Third World\u2014 a subject matter I tried to understand earlier in the semester (September 1992). This position paper is for the main university course. I have to hand in it in tomorrow. I have done two drafts already. Pm not good at the computer. Sometimes my work disappears from the screen. I just started learning how to use the computer and I have to also learn the function of the different keys. Shift F10 for save. I better save, save and not delete. Darn, since I can't find the disk with my other drafts, I have to type this stupid stuff all over again. I can't even remember some things that I wrote before. I crouch before my computer, roll up the sleeves on my sweater, flex my fingers to keyboard, lose a few hours of sleep and place newly learned words and theories on the computer screen. I have to show my TA that I can write well. I have to do so tonight. My advisor at TYP says I should always edit my work. Got no time for that. I have to trouble to another... We will find no solution if we insist that the same system apply to all students in the same way, that all students be subject to the same rules and the same penalties. But that requirement, after all probably stems much more from administrative need and custom than from anything else. Systems that could satisfy student criteria might be developed if we removed the restriction that the systems apply uniformly to all students (Becker, Geer, Hughes: 1968, 145). According to Professor Bonnie Burstow (2003) Lecture: \"The Psychiatric definition of trauma is a mental disorder that comes about after an event that happened to an individual. \"This definition is broad and suggests negative images as \"mentally ill... \"Current non-psychiatric Hey 53 hand it in tomorrow. I knowI should. Yes, I should edit my paper. Who will do it for me now? No one. Not now. All I should care about right now is to finish my paper and I am ecstatic. Ecstatic to report how Europe helped to create underdevelopment in the Third World. I want to give my position from deep, deep inside me, from an academic point of view. I write with passion. I include examples about how my ancestors were captured and sold into slavery, how Europe exploited the Third World and became rich. I complete my first mission. I feel good. I don't read over my paper. But I will hand it in on time. TA's Comment, Trauma and Shattered Self A few weeks later, I march eagerly into the classroom to retrieve my paper from my TA. I ama bit shy. I don't talk much to the TA. I don't talk much in class. Once, in one of my tutorials, the TA told the group of students that he was very surprised about our reading and comprehension because high school kids in his country understood one of the texts better than we did. None of the other students said anything to him. We remained quiet while he became more upset that we were not talking in the tutorials. Since then, I definition of trauma: An event short or long. Hyper arousal of the nervous system; a danger had taken place\u2014 \"Person(s) feels unsafe, terrified, or haunted... The root word for trauma means wound; something is broken; or a connection is severed: not whole; not whole...\" (Lecture notes). According to Chris Steerman (2003): Trauma can be physical or non-physical... Trauma can occur to anyone at anytime. It can be a single catastrophe or something that occurs repeatedly. Trauma can be physical or non- physical, and can range from divorce, natural disaster to violence. Traumatic events may not have been experienced first-hand, but only witnessed. The type of trauma referred to here is primarily interpersonal, in which one person has been. 54 find I don't like him. Students scatter in the classroom reading their papers. Students walk out of the room with their eyes focused on their papers. I walk briskly up to the TA. \"Hi, I'm here to pick up my paper.\" The TA looks up at me, \"Denise, right?\" \"YES,\" I say in my strong soldier voice. \"Denise Clarke. Clarke with an E.\" The TA searches for my paper, finds it and gives it to me. I take the paper and walk to a corner where there is no ~ other student\u2014 not wanting anyone to see my mark. I turn to the last page where the grade sits. I receive six out of ten. Iam happy. This mark isn't so bad for a first mission. I turn to the first page. The TA wrote IRRELEVANT in big capital letters that filled the left margin. That's alright. I turn to the last page again and read the comments. I freeze as : my eyes rest on the words. I squeeze my lips together. My eyelids lock. I open eyes again and scan the comments. This paper is just a hotc) - potch of confusion, As you can see, much of it is also irreleuant to the question. As I indicated someuhere in my margin comments, you would have been better off stating your understanding of Frank's explanation of underdeveloprrent... The TA attacks me. He catches me off-guard. The TA fires a grenade in my head. I am weak and disoriented. I am Fear and shame make it profoundly difficult to talk about traumatic experiences' (Kerka: 2002, 2). When we write comments that purport to be true in general or true for other readers, we are likely to be wrong.... Even when we write about what happened to us in reading, we are paying students the intellectual respect of trying to avoid lies (Elbow: 2003, 3-4). 55 alone in this crowded room. The students do not notice me. They laugh. They chatter. \"Hey, Marlene. What did you get?\" They brag. \"I got eighty.\" \"I got seventy-three... .\" I drift in and out of consciousness. I don't care about the mark. I just want to pass. But my mind can't get past the comment. I can't allow my classmates to see the comment, to see my wound. My mother taught me to be strong. Because of the mental strength acquired from living with her, I manage to limp from the classroom numb, in a daze like a lost soldier. I wobble into the washroom. I want to understand why the TA shot me and whyI am vulnerable. I have to take care of my wound to continue my journey. I don't know what 'hotch potch' means. It sounds like hopscotch, the game I played as a child in Jamaica, jumping from box to box to retrieve my stone and to claim boxes until I won or lost. I wonder if he's talking about hopscotch. But because confusion follows 'hotch potch', I place them in context. Two girls put on makeup before the mirror in the washroom. I walk into the toilet room and lock the door [A]buses of power by teacher could not be justified on any ground, but others were artefacts of everyday assessment practices, which we regard as perfectly normal (Boud: 1995, 36). Whenever a person is devalued and internalizes the negative judgment of an other, shame flourishes. Shame attends the process of subjection in general...(Adamson and Clarke:1999, 2-3). Because the self is the focus of awareness in shame, 'identity' imagery is usually evoked. At the same time, that this identity imagery of the self in the other's eyes. This creates a \"doubleness of experience,\" which is characteristic of shame... Shame is the vicarious experience of the other's 56 with the latch. I quietly turn to the last page of my paper. I look at the \"IRRELEVANT\" all over. My work is no good. Tears flow, my heart aches, my confidence shatters and my spirit breaks. \"Just a hotch potch of confusion... Irrelevant... Irrelevant... Irrelevant...\" I look up hotch - potch in my Oxford Dictionary that night. The two words were joined together in the dictionary and meant \"confused mixture or jumble, esp. of ideas.\" Iam afraid to continue this war. I am afraid to tell my family about my injury. Shame, Silence, Secret and Sadness I can't tell anyone. I can't tell my mother. She will tell me to quit - to abandon my post and leave the battlefield even if I have to face treason. She will try to shield me from the trauma, the bullets, the pain and all dangers here. She completed grade three. She won't understand why I would want to stay somewhere that hurts me. I can't tell my sisters. They might think that I'm not as bright as I made them think or as they believe. I can't tell my classmates at TYP. They might tell their other friends that I'm stupid, that I can't write, that they did better than me, that I shouldn't be in the TYP. They will laugh at me. I can negative evaluation. In order for shame to occur, there must be a relationship between the self and the other in which the self cares about the other's evaluation...Fascination with the other and sensitivity to the other's treatment of the self render the self more vulnerable in shame (Lewis: 1999, 107-8). Students make their judgments of themselves and one another in this way. They take the chief valuable institutionalized by the college and reinforced by the living group prestige system\u2014grades\u2014and use it as a way of making personal judgments. Grades reflect a person's worth; inadequate grades indicate an important personal deficiency (Becker, Geer, Hughes: 1968, 110). Of course, negative writing experience can discourage any writer-\u2014regardless of gender.... Gender, however, can complicate these difficulties because academic women are already positioned as \"outsider in the sacred grove\"...and may interpret negative writing experiences as direct challenges to their place and authority in the academy (Kirsch: 1993, 67). 57 picture some of them. I can see their faces. I can see their joy over my shame and pain. I will tell Denise. I can talk to her. She will listen. She won't criticize. She's my friend. I pick up my son, Danier from daycare. He just turned one. I can't talk to him, can't share my pain\u2014he's too young. I go home, spend some time with him, read him a story and put him to bed at 8:00 p.m. I go to my room, lie on my back on my bed and call Denise. \"Ete sen, (How are you?\" I greet her in Chi, her Ghanian language. \"Eye, (I'm fine\"), she replies. I tell Denise of my injury. \"T'm sorry,\" she says. \"Don't tell anyone. Please.\" \"Alright. Sorry.\" \"That's ok,\" I say and hang up the telephone. I cty and think about the battle I'm in. ['m not happy. I'm not bright. ''m not fighting right, maybe I should quit. Tears push their way through my closed eyelids and run past my ears and wet my pillow. I remember the joyful days I spent going to clubs and There is nothing good about shame, which wounds in direct proportion to the good feeling and sense of relational safety it attacks, impedes, stifles (Adamson and Clarke: 1999, vii). Is it equitable to treat all people the same when they have inequitable relations to power and resources in school and society? Raising kids, community, and receiving lower wages are handicaps to academic work which affect working women and minorities disproportionately because working-class mothers are expected to take care of children, keep house, and earn money while they go to college....(Pincus: 1996, 85) . 58 movies and not having to read a book unless I wanted to. I remember the nights Denise and I drank Coke and played and sang UB40's Red Red Wine on her small tape player even though we do not drink alcohol. We had danced and danced and laughed and laughed. I had taught her how to move her behind in circular movements to the beat of the song like how some Jamaican girls dance, especially to the part that says, Red red wine you make re feel so fine You keep me rocking all of the time Red red wine you make me feel so grand I feel a million dollars when your're just in my hand... I had parted from that kind of joy. I had looked forward to the joy of learning although it is now painful. I had craved for this knowledge I can hardly understand. I had looked forward to singing Lulu's song To Sirfor Madam] With Low at the end of this war, when I graduate. I had thought about celebrating my success. Now I have to think about how I can survive. How I can survive this blow and prevent another. I lie on my bed and sing in my damaged head: Gre ne litle tire, help re dear up me mind Giee ne little tirre, help me dear up me mind Give re Red wine because it make me feel fine Mek ne feel fire all of the time Red red wine you make me feel so fine I wish that I drank red wine.

Soldiers don't fight alone, I think. If they do, they will leave themselves vulnerable to their opponents. I want to catch up with them and my commander. I need to mobilize with them. I meet two of my allies at the TYP building. I tell them about the comments on my paper. \"Bastard,\" one says. \"He's evil,\" I say. Grades are universally inconsistent with each other because different teachers - weight different features:some teachers grade more in terms mask, from my face. I will do better next time, I think, I will of memory, others more in a \"He's a jerk,\" another says.

Commander Horace seems struck by the comments. He takes my paper to the professor who teaches the course. What matters for language as a communicative device is not that the members of a linguistic community all have the identical dynamic system of grammar but rather that the external products of grammar are perceived as fulfilling the relevant communicative needs in local situations (Turner: 1996, 30). Languages are best seen as different systems reflecting different varieties of the human condition. Although they may be unequal in complexity at given points, this does not imply that some have, overall, greater expressive power. Environments differ and, therefore, the things that must be detailed in language differ (Edwards: 1985, 19). 60 A Matter of Language The professor reads the paper and writes his comments in red. The TA wrote his comments in black. Red and black covers my four-page paper. I read the professor's comments. They sometimes agreed and sometimes did not agree with the TA's comments. [Chad] and I disagree on what is relevant. His other comments are sound. I would probably hare green [the] same grade, or marginally different one The problem of the paper is language.

The professor's comments give me some reassurances. I feel better but I feel apprehensive to start other missions. | persevere. I have no choice but to continue fighting for my son, for myself and because I know I am strong enough to endure to the end, I will do better next time. I receive passing marks in the pre-university programme. I apply to the University of Toronto. Victoria College accepts me. ] am now on my own. 61 First Year - Big University The Western traditionalists have initiated a national effort to defend the dominance of Western civilization in the school and university curriculum\" (Banks: 2002, 5). The student, pursuing his academic goals in the large community of the university, defines his situation as one in which he must do well by getting grades sufficiently high for his own purposes, however, he has come to define these... The student gets his grades from the instructors for whose courses he has registered, and he earns them by working for them, by fulfilling in one way or another and at one or another level of proficiency the requirements the instructors set for the course.... The more proficient his performance, the higher the resulting grades. (Becker, Geer, Hughes:1968, 63). I am in a bigger battle as a lone soldier with some young energetic soldiers who have come to this war with much preparation. They completed grade thirteen in high school. Some of them have parents who know more about the educational system at the university level. Some of their parents have been to university, some of them probably teach here too. Their parents promise to stand by them. I have to fight with and against some of these students. Sociology, TA, Trauma and Silence in Failure Sociology. I want to take sociology. I will learn about _ society. Darn, there are so many words and definitions to learn. The TA looks at me Et-- ethnicity, I can't pronounce it. _ with a strange look as I stop to pronounce it. Deviance, I can pronounce it. Deviance means -- I was a deviant. I ran away at fifteen. \"What does the author say, Denise?\" I remain quiet. I don't like to talk in class. I am not confident that I understand everything the book says. \"If you don't do your readings, you will fail the course,\" the _TA says. I feel like telling her to shut up. Why does she think I did not read? I just don't understand everything. But when a person comes upon a data that can't be processed with the concepts he has (or not processed to solve the given problem), then the ability to apply concepts widely does no good, and he needs instead the second source of real learning, the ability to construct a new concepts (Elbow : 1986, 14). [W]e may note the general principle that whenever two categories of people have to cooperate in some common enterprise, one is likely to judge the other by how much or how little he contributes to the success of the enterprise as one has defined it (Becker, Geer, Hughes: 1968, 109). A and F are performances causing acute pleasure orpain, a powerful jolt for the teacher one way or the other of B and D are for performances yielding definite satisfaction or disappointment; C is for the affectless middle. Anyone who y pretends to be shocked that grades should measure the affective response of the teacher ought to direct his energies instead to what is more problematic: that is so seldom admitted (Elbow: 1986, 169). 62 The end of the school years comes. I studied a lot. I write _ the exam. My transcript arrives in the mail. \"E\" means fail. Fail. I _ failed Sociology? Fifty is the pass mark and I received forty- A eight. I can't believe the ugly TA failed me. Tears just roll down my cheeks. Why couldn't she give me fifty? Why forty-eight? I can't tell anyone. Forty-eight? Forty eight! I will fight. I need my two marks. I need to pass. I call the _ TA. I get the answering machine. This is Denise Clarke 'maalling because you failed me and I reed to talk to -you. My phone number ts ... \u00ab.

I need to talk to ... She failed me. What can I do _ about my marks? If one or two students do badly in an assignment, we can usually assume it is the student who needs attention, but where a whole cohort hands in inadequate or incorrect work, this indicates some kind of failure in the teaching or assignment briefing methodologies (35).... We then have fairly firm indicator that something needs to be changed, : and often some hints on how we should do so (Brown and Knight: 1994, 36). The details of nightmares cast doubt on the usefulness of exams as a productive stage in the learning experience of students (Race: 1995. 62). 63 \"You a can appeal,\" the administrative assistant says. \"Appeal? Why can't the TA change my mark? Why did she give me that mark?\" \"I don't know, Denise. If you can't get her, you will have to : _ put in an appeal.\" \"Can I talk to the Professor? \"IT don't know what he can do, but here's his extension - number.

I battle to But how can | give grades based on non-academic juggle home and school duties, battle student life and financial factors like hours per week - changing diapers...

Should it be structured first around the already unequal situations among working-class __ students of different genders, colors, and family situations, and structured secondly around the economic inequality between worthy students and - those from wealth background? _ (Ira Shor: 1996, 84). \"Well, I don't have the money.\" \"T will have to take you to court.\" \"I've been to prison for murder so I'm not scared of the court,\" I lie, to scare him off. \"Grow up little girl and face your responsibilities,\" the bill collector shouted in my ear. My first impulse to respond is to utter two words that that will get him off my phone. \"\"*# %* you,\" I say and slam the phone on the receiver before he can say another word. He calls back about ten times _ but I do not pick up the phone. I continue to study. Two days pass. The daycare leaves a message on my answering machine: 65 \"Denise, Darier has an ear infection. Please come and get him\" I do not call back the daycare and I do not get Danier immediately. I stay at school until my last class. Thank God the daycare doesn't have a direct number to reach me. I feel like a bad mother, but almost every other week he gets an infection or a cold at the daycare. I don't think he will die. He got the ear infection there and I have to deal with it. I don't know why they want me to deal with it. Why can't they deal with it? Fearing to Write and Silence But if the standard variety of a language is a necessary acquisition for 'educated' speakers as individuals and as a group, what is to be done about the right of non-standard speakers in schools and about the objective sociolinguistic fact that non-standard varieties exist in everyone's world?... Valuing non-standard varieties is not an easy thing for people I take on missions that I shouldn't. I take a course with _ novels written in the nineteenth century. They do not address my culture or my people. They do not address my class. I have _ to critique them. I struggle to do my best. I put together papers to do, especially if they are only vaguely aware than non- standard varieties exist. For the teacher, it may be contrary to a professional lifetime of tacit prejudice against non-standard = varieties, a form of prejudice that endures,..., even when the differences between their own varieties and those of students present few difficulties of mutual comprehension (Corson: 2001, 77 cites and give them in without getting an editor to look at them.

I remember Mr McMurdy, one of my high school Edwards 1977). Very frequently, the assignments and requirements attached to a given course do not require the student to learn the information and skills that the instructor wishes him to learn, but rather another set of skills more closely related to the examination and assignments actually given (Geer, Hughes: 1968, 76). The English professor may want his students to acquire the \u00a9 ability to enjoy and analyze literature (Becker, Geer, Hughes: 1968, 77). 66 teachers.

I cannot say that I Faculty often complain that students are \"careless\" in their use of vocabulary, in their citation practices, and in their Because many literacy classes value the personal essay and because many readings in literacy classes are in story form or are adapted or specially written for these classes, students are not exposed to the \u00a9 exactness of some academic prose. One of our responsibilities in developing socioliterate practice is to expose students to authentic academic texts and to analyze these texts for the specificity (Johnson, 1997, 58). Receiving feedback can be an excellent motivator, especially when valid criticism is supported by appropriate praise and commentary... However, it is not always easy to provide the level and depth of feedback that one would desire, especially when there are large numbers of students (Brown and Knight: 1994, 33- 34). my mark is better. 67 _ procrastinated.

One of the main reasons why smart students function well is that they are seen as smart (Elbow: 1986, xiv), can actively participate in the construction of this narrative of who we are.... We count on the fact that we will wake up each morning with this narrative intact. A serious violation of this structure, as in the case of violent trauma, is a source of horror to human imagination. Nothing is more frightening than trying to imagine \u00ab the loss of this \"I.\" The gradual erosion of the 'I' is basically the process we witness in progressive Alzheimer's disease ( Gold: 2002, 64). Competent teachers insist on taking themselves out of the center and focusing instead on the student and the things the student has to master (Elbow: 1986, 124). 69 Second Year - A Cure for my Wounded Spirit \"T will fight hard for my marks,\" I tell Raquel, a fellow soldier, \"even if I have to lose lots of sleep.\" \"Don't kill yourself,\" she says. \u2014 I put on my uniform and my helmet, put on my boots, tie my 7 _ laces and throw my heavy backpack with all my ammunitions inside on my back.

[T]he system of grades and credits provides an institutional framework that instructors can use to reward those who learn to meet academic requirement and punish those who do not (Becker, Geer, Hughes: 1968, 79). it would not be difficult,...to show that even in college some teachers include dress, appearance, [language,] and carriage in their grading, and not merely as accidental corollaries of other factors (not to mention gender and race) (Elbow: 986, 169). [W]e may note the general principle that whenever two categories of people have to cooperate in some common enterprise, one is likely to judge the other by how much or how little he contributes to the success of the enterprise as one has defined it (Becker, Geer, Hughes: 1968, 109). [Ajll grades represent interpretations and evaluations of what someone said, wrote, or did. And we continue to let grades determine very weighty consequences for students, such as scholarship money 70 Third Year - TA and Trauma Again I want to stay in this war. I welcome third year. In second year, I tried to stay away from courses with TAs. One reason: I do not get to know my professors well. Another _ reason: I believe TAs tend to mark harder. I still remember -\"hotch potch of confusion\". I take a course with tutorials this year. This TA does not _ appear threatening. She is soft-spoken. She smiles a lot too. I _ don't think there'll be any battles. I complete my first mission for the TA. I hand in my _ paper. I wait for the TA to return the paper. I think I did a ; spectacular job. The least I think I will get is a B+. The TA brings the papers to class. I take mine. I scan _ it. The TA writes on one and a half pages. The comments are \"single-spaced. She starts off positive: Your essay is well organized, quite thorough in certain parts, and coer a wry broad rare of factors concerning the... twhidh in itself suggests a considerable amount of serious and wide-ranging... .

I worked hard on this essay. I got recreated? Others, however, see value in these comments, reckoning that they can amend their understanding of the topic _ in light of the tutor's observations. This range of reactions might have been predicted from work on learning styles (Brown and Knight: 1994, 108). A trauma in the present will link up with troubled relationships and disturbing events from the past and give fresh life to old or buried issues which may have been more or less manageable ~ up to that point (Garland: 71 you approached the issue with care but not enough depth.

I continue to read the comments for my conclusion: I glimpse two words. Mish Mash... What is nash mash about my conclusion? Is she trying to paralyze me. The two words bring back memories of \"hotch- After all, they say, what value is . potch\". For all the other comments she's made, all I can think . of is \"MishMash\". Why? Is it because it rhymes with \"hotch- . tt edited several times. I can write, I knowI can.

Mish Mash opens the old wound, the wound I wanted to forget about\u2014 the hotch potch. It seems like the TAs have something in common. They know how to rhyme in rhymes that I don't like, rhymes that wound 1998(b), 109). When we teach students how to write, when we call their attention to \"mistakes: in grammar, and so on. .... we need to remind ourselves that this conception or \"correct\" usage in relation to language is itself not quite correct. To put the matter more bluntly, itis false. There are in fact two mistakes that this account makes ... that it starts out by ignoring and ends up contradicting (Lang: 1991, 26). All assessment methods, traditional or otherwise, disadvantage some students so we recommend the adoption of diverse methods to remedy inequalities as far as possible (Brown and Knight: 1994, 7). ...psychotherapists actually believe that the more frequenta person is traumatized, the less likely the person is to remember having been traumatized (Creamer: 2003, 36). 72 _ my spirit, make me ponder quitting, make me feel bad about myself, This TA over-reads into my paper and write too much and _ then like the other, she did not know what to say so she rhymed ___astupid rhyme at my psychological expense. I breathe hard and read the comment underneath the conclusion. No sentence structure! Mish-Mash. Focus on the main thrust of thesis. I don't need a TA to tell me that my writing has potential or that - it will improve. I know that I have the ability to do whatever I want. Does she think she's telling me something new? I take my dictionary from my bag and search for \"mish mish,\" because it's bothering me. Like \"hotch potch\" the words are S joined together. They mean the same thing. Hotchpotch and 7 mishmash mean confused. Another TA has confirmed that my . writing is confusing. I'm glad not all my TAs try to make me feel bad about my writing because my traumas will perhaps _ become something normal. Uhnnnn! Oh, she's going to feel my tongue. I breathe in and out. I learned how to breathe in yoga classes. I read on, Writing style has potential, and showstrengths and subtlety in parts. More practice will unprow.

Confronting Authority I march into the classroom at my next tutorial meeting with my : paper in my hand. I will not negotiate. I had gathered enough bullets one week in advance.

But what do you want to do?\" -. Without allowing me to reply, she continues. \"Do you think : you have time for a fight right now?\" is realized. Every outcome that - school tries to achieve depends on the language ability of students: Students need high level skills in apprehending language; they also need to acquire the concepts at the heart of the curriculum that are expressed in language that teachers and text employ in the process of passing on that curriculum knowledge (Corson: 2001, 14). Learning to write is easier for some people than others and, moreover, it is not necessarily easiest for those who show the talent! For some people writing gets easier as they get better at it and for others it keeps getting harder. There is nothing paradoxical about this. The task of writing is not fixed but is very much what the writer makes it (Bereiter and Scardamalia:1983, 22). \"T don't, but I think I should.\" \"Listen Kiddo, sometimes you have to pick your fights. Is it a good time for you to fight right now? You've got a whole bunch of issues to deal with. 'Taking care of your son, _ completing your papers, and studying for your summer exams.

The story tells of the various ways I made my way through the academy during my undergraduate years. Next, I will show what I discovered from the story. 81 Chapter 6: Findings and Discussions Voice to My Experience The journey to give voice to my experience of writing, language, comments, trauma and my resistance to the wounding of my spirit during my TYP and undergraduate years has brought me to another stage on this journey\u2014 to share with you some of the significant results of this research, I will ask central questions about my experience and attempt to find answers to those questions. Practical implications of these findings include suggestions for improving the training of TAs and recommendations for constructively commenting on students' writing and language usage in their papers, without intentionally or unintentionally wounding their spirits. Writing and Language The challenge of fitting the formal traditional structure of academic writing dominated every other concern I had about writing while I was in the academy. Because I was an \"early school leaver,\" and had dropped out of high school without acquiring strong traditional wnting skills, writing in the new academic language proved difficult for me. I did not posses the academic language and the formal writing foundation to strengthen my writing\u2014a skill that the university prides itself on. Teachers and TAs expect students to know how to write without \"errors\" before entering the academy. Bourdieu (1982) states that, \"[t]he relative importance of differing linguistic norms... are established by the discourse of teachers\" (Kouritzin: 1987, 17). Guy Allen states that, \"(ijn the teaching of writing, [there is a] preoccupation with formal properties such as rules of usage or spelling and the conventions of formal academic style\" (2002, 140). I had to struggle to write in the required university language and according all the rules that came with that usage. Consequently, I have resisted writing that way because I hate things being imposed on me. Yet, my resistance to 82 that type of writing had several sources, including the trauma I experienced, my fear of writing, my inability to quickly grasp the skill, the rules that come with traditional academic writing conventions and the dominance of this writing including the unwavering expectation that students use this style of writing in the academy. The imposition of writing in the traditional academic model is highly problematic. One reason is that it is exclusive\u2014 people like me, who did not acquire a strong foundation to prepare for writing in the university language, find it difficult and sometimes prohibitive to continuing their studies First-year students must quickly demonstrate their ability to write in a highly structured language or else their TAs and instructors will regard them as poor wniters. We must not forget, though, that many students (especially first-year students) in programs such as Social Sciences and Engineering experience difficulty writing. Within the last thirty years, universities, and U of Tin particular, have established increasing numbers of writing labs, where students can go to receive help with their writing. (U of T's Transitional Year Programme has, since its inception, led the way in initiating writing labs.) 'The fact that these labs exist demonstrates that many students require help with their writing and that universities have come to recognize it. Yet there is the expectation that students must write exceptionally well even when they only have time to write a single draft. This is not to say that all TAs or instructors do not permit their students to rewrite papers. Some do. For example, Afua Cooper tells of a professor who had returned her paper to her in her first year at university, commenting that he knew she could have written a better one and allowed her to remove the minor grammatical errors (Conversation with Cooper). The \"writing problem\" may actually be much more complex, involving issues of confidence, community discourse, class and social integration. How do we as educators distinguish the good writers from the dad writers? Can we even make such distinction in a fair and accurate way?

Is the student who did not edit her paper a worse writer than the student who writes in a similar way but has received additional assistance? Some people believe that being able to edit your own work is the essence of the art of writing. I believe there should be a gradual process where students produce several drafts 84 rather than viewing their papers as the end product of a first draft or second draft. Guy Allen states that he does not teach students writing but revision. In his class, Allen allows students to produce as many drafts as they want to, in order to improve their writing. One professor gave me the opportunity to revise a paper without losing marks. In assessing and evaluating students' papers, we must use our good sense and good judgment to inform the process. Some TAs, when placed in charge of grading the work of others tend to forget where they came from and what their writing was like as first year students. This attitude is perhaps a reflection of the TAs arrogance toward their students. Lyon (1971) states that, ,.. an occupational hazard for the college professor is arrogance. This grows out of the easy victories of the classroom where he works with young people who know less than he does. He may thus unconsciously come to believe that business, politics and educational administration would be much better managed if those in charge would only apply the same intelligence to their work that he uses in his own... (35) I agree with Lyon and I will add from my observation that this attitude is far too prevalent. The level of writing that many first year students can manage soon after high school, could not begin to measure up to that achieved by their TAs. Moreover, just as some one-year-old babies only crawl while others can walk and others run, students come to the university at different levels of skill development. The professor who re-evaluated my paper after the TA made the wounding comment, saw through the roughly strung together sentences, the grammatical errors and the paragraphs that did not seem to connect. He saw the writing problem as \"a problem of language\" and that I had not yet grasped the language of my new community. The traditional approach to assessing expository writing is also exclusive in character because instructors, in marking papers, often do not factor in students' language skills. While some features of the university are exceedingly slow to change, the university's student population is rapidly changing. The population is no longer mainly white males or middle and upper class students. 85 Single-mothers like myself, wives who had stayed home to raise children, people who left school early, people with different academic talents, people with physical challenges, people from different countries with varying English language writing and speaking skills among others, now study in Canadian universities in large numbers. To accommodate everyone, different methods of evaluating writing are required. Do we need also to regard assignments as opportunities for students to learn and practice these skills? In terms of addressing students with English language wniting skills in the academy, we should adopt what Guy Allen (2000) proposes. He states: Learners who work outside of their mother tongue deserve respect for their courage. Teachers can, and ought to, modify their practices to help students negotiate, and even mend, the split between self and school. When teachers do this, they make learning possible (8). A person's depth of knowledge and comprehension often does not correlate with the person's ability to write in a conventionally structured way. The demand that all adhere to the forms of structured traditional expository writing is too pervasive and dominating in universities. Jean Mason (2003) comments that, \"whereas I think there is value in being able to think and even write in a highly structured propositional mode, I find that it dominates our system far too much.\" I agree with Mason and I believe that we should allow alternative ways for students to express in writing what they learn in the academy. \"The problem is that students cannot have that crucial experience of safety for writing inside our classrooms unless we can also show them how to be safe outside\u2014 that is, unless we can also help them produce final drafts that conform to Standard Written English\" (Elbow: 2000, 325). Options in evaluating students who are learning the language, such as placing emphasis on their progress with drafts and revisions rather than solely on a single supposedly final draft. When students receive negative comments on a single draft that unfairly represents their writing skills, they begin to question themselves and can come to see their writing selves as alien to their true selves. 86 Adapting to the Language and the Development of the False Self I also discovered that the process of writing in a set way could cause the development of a false or split self In looking back at the first paper, the one where I received the \"hotch-potch\" comment, you will remember that I had not grasped the language of the academy, my new community at that point. Even later, although my writing improved, for the most part, the compliance with formal writing style still negatively affected me and I remained afraid to write and express my thoughts in language familiar to me. Adapting the university's dialect or language and writing style led to my development of a false self' According to D. W. Winnicot, the false self has one significant function: \"to hide the Tie Self, which it does by compliance with environmental demands\" (Winnicot: 1990 147). To comply with the new community or environmental demands, I quickly tried to adapt to the writing style of my new community. Although my writing was not the best, I wrote in ways to hide my True Self, the part of me that could not write in the new language of the academy. I began to 'imitate' and 'comply' with the new writing demands leading \"to the annihilation of my True Self \"(Winnicot: 1990, 147). This false self, my defence in my writing tried to imitate the academic language current in my new community. Writing the traditional way forced me to write in a manner that exposed me\u2014 the 'phony' or false self. The way my words connected, made writing in the traditional academic model almost impossible for me at the outset. Often, the words ran across the computer screen or on the blank pages as Peter Elbow (1981) discusses \"as though the words came through some kind of mixer rather than being [written]... bya person (288). The stiffness or rigidity of writing the form of the new academic language and the stiffness of the form itself, compounded my writing problem. \"In my view,\" according to Guy Allen (2000), \"the deeper the split between self and school is, the greater the impediment it presents to learning\" (7). 87 Using vocabulary and rules of syntax in ways I was not familiar with was a dreadful experience. I often wrote without understanding what I wrote. I could not find the nght words to articulate what I wanted to say. I faked using words. According to Guy Allen, The compliant response of the False Self leads many students, especially students who feel marginal in the university\u2014 students from working class families, and students who speak English as their second language\u2014 to imitate the elevation and complexity they associate with academy dialect. Since this dialect seems opaque to them, they reproduce its opacity. Sometimes they do this unconsciously. Other times, they intentionally imitate this opacity. They shift into complicated syntax and inflated vocabulary they have no experience using\u2014 and naturally this alien style looks awkward and suffused with errors (Allen: 2002,154). Writing in the traditional academic model could not \"generate syntactic correspondences by manipulating the order of sounds until they 'make sense\" (Alice Brand: 2000, 214). I could not \"harness such complexities, to create prose that thrills\" (Hale 1999). Neither could I write the way Hale (1999) describes it \"as the prissy grammar rules dictating how to put words together\" (Hale 1999). I dared not write academic English following in the general rules where, \"the subject comes before the main verb, and the direct object, if there is one, comes third. Adjectives come in front of the nouns they describe\" (Davidson 1972). The false self took over to hide my true self. This splitting of my self helped to make possible the shedding of aspects of my identity, which allowed me to fit into the new communtty. My Jamaican English battled with Canadian standard English, and the English in the academy, until a fusion got underway and gradually, the language of the academy, for my survival in the academic community, took precedence over almost all of my writing and speaking life in the academy. 88 Using \"I\" and My Mother Tongue Despite the tendency to develop a false self, I gained confidence in my writing when I used \"I\" and my mother tongue. During my undergraduate studies, when I discovered I could take an expressive writing course, I jumped at the offer. In this course (during my undergraduate studies), using \"I\" and my mother tongue, I discovered that my writing improved, my sentences became clearer and I enjoyed writing. By connecting myself with my writing and employing my mother tongue, I felt I was doing what is second nature for most people talking about my subject. I also did not feel I was writing in an unfamiliar language. Joseph Gold (2002) writes that, What we need to learn is that we can actively participate in the construction of this narrative of who we are.... We count on the fact that we will wake up each morning with this narrative intact. A serious violation of this structure, as in the case of violent trauma, is a source of horror to human imagination. Nothing is more frightening than trying to imagine the loss of this \"I.\" The gradual erosion of the \"I\" is basically the process we witness in progressive Alzheimer's disease (64). This finding is important as we can see that many versions of the traditional academic model, until recently, withheld permission for students to use \"I\" and for the most part still do not permit students to use their mother tongue in their writing. The mother tongue, of course, cannot be applied in all academic discourse areas for many reasons, such as teachers' inability to understand the language. But if a student cannot use his or her mother tongue in her papers, the student should be able to use \"I\". Unedited and Edited Papers While the \"I\" helped build my confidence, another finding shows that the papers I did under time constraints, or the ones I rushed could and have had detrimental effects on my spirit or my 89 confidence. The papers I wrote without spending much time on helped to feed into the markers' lack of tolerance for unedited papers, with mistakes or grammatical errors. My inability to write in the academic language compounded the unedited paper or rushed paper problem. I wrote the paper that received the \"hotch-potch\" comment overnight at a time when I was new to the university. Because I still needed to develop my academic writing skill, I left myself vulnerable and exposed to the reader. In spite of not spending much time on the paper I handed in, and although I wrote it in a rush, I still do not think that any TA had the right to place such a comment. I think that teachers should be able to sometimes infer the circumstances under which a student writes a paper. A paper with many grammatical errors could indicate that a student wrote it in a rush while one with language usage problems could indicate that a student might have difficulty with the language. I can easily distinguish papers that clearly mark a student's ability to wnite in the academic language from ones where the student seems to be struggling although of course, there are papers which do not readily fit in either groups. Also, I can detect a paper where a student has written well but perhaps has not had the time to edit the paper. In truth, learning to time my work in order to write my papers and completing them on time, while allowing myself enough time to reflect, and to get editorial advice gave me a sense of power over my own destiny in terms of my grades. In most of these cases, the markers formed a different perception of my writing ability. I also felt that I had more bargaining power to fight for what I believed in. Yet, surprisingly, a well-written, edited paper still does not guarantee helpful or useful comments. Bias may playa role. It is clear that the TA who drew happy faces on my friend's paper showed some affection towards my friend. However, as a TA myself, and to give the TA the benefit of the doubt I am now wondering if the TA started to draw happy faces and then ran out of time. In my experience as a TA marking and evaluating students' work, I remember putting check marks on students' papers, but I realized later that I did not put them on some. I had to flip though the 90 papers again to find the ones IJ had forgotten. As evaluators and assessors of student's papers we must be vigilant about our own biases and we must be consistent in our treatment of students. This means that even if a student receives a low grade, evaluation must be fair, consistent and done with sensitivity toward all students. This leads to my observation about minority TAs. Minority TAs As a student I was surprised to find that racialized or minority TAs tended to treat me more 'harshly' in their comments than others did. A minority (black) TA wrote the 'hotch potch\" comments on my paper. Another minority (South Asian) TA told me that she could fail me, and did fail me, in Sociology. The two had left their countries, former British Colonies and had come to Canada to study. Federick Case (2002) in Racsmand National Consciousness writes that, \"[t]he major division that exists among Blacks in Canada appears to be that of class and not of geographic origin\" (105). Case cautions that \"Blacks in Canada have to guard against the dangers of our own racism, we also have to guard against the denial of our human dignity if, indeed, we have any left\" (19). I often wondered if the TA gave me the comment because of my race, class, background or my new membership in the academic community, which he could detect in my spoken and written language. In addition, the TA knew that I was also enrolled in TYP, a program that caters to students who normally would not have had the opportunity to enter university. The South Asian TA knew my difficulties with pronouncing words that were new to me. I wonder if these TAs, as minorities, had internalized their own oppression as minorities in Canadian society and then transferred their oppression unto me who was also a minority student. I also wondered if they felt a sense of shame because my language and writing skills did not meet their expectation of me and that of the university. In Black Skin, White Mask, Frantz Fanon (1952) states, 91 Every colonized people\u2014 in other words, every people in whose soul an inferiority complex has been created by the death and burial of its local cultural originality\u2014 finds itself face to face with the language of the civilizing nation; that is, with the culture of the mother country. The colonized is elevated above his jungle status in proportion to his adoption of the mother country's cultural standards. He becomes whiter as he renounces his blackness... . (18). TAs might feel the need to demonstrate that they are tough markers or commentators, and perhaps their students might view them as competent. However, I do not see hurtful comments as making someone an effective evaluator. Instead they show lack of sensitivity towards students and arrogance. Perhaps the Black TA's treatment of me was a result of helplessness felt by some parents whom, in order to make their children succeed, feel the need to chastise even if chastisement hurts. As minority students, the TAs may have felt that they had a right to punish me. I search for answers to all that I wonder about. As I did not ask those TAs why they were harsh with me I will never know their answers. At that time, I was still trying to find my way into the new academic community. All that was new to me overwhelmed me. Even if most TAs write good comments and many care about their students, there are a few whose comments can destroy the spirit. Comments and Trauma\u2014 the Wounding of the Spirit Finally, I have discovered the impact of comments. By taking this journey, I have discovered what comments might cause. After talking with friends, instructors, and colleagues and after surveying the limited literature I started to dig into my memory to help me name what I experienced from comments. I discovered that the negative comments caused me trauma\u2014 a wounding of the spirit I need to succeed in university while the positive and helpful ones uplifted my spirit. The wounding comments filled me with the unpleasant feelings associated with trauma. After the initial shock I experienced from the \"hotch-potch\" comment, I felt overwhelming shame whenever a TA made me feel that I could not write. According to Helen M. Lynd, \"[e]xperiences of 92 shame appear to embody the root meaning of the word\u2014 to uncover, to expose, to wound (Wursmer: 1981 52). Realizing that my writing was bad and that someone had discovered it, I wanted to hide myself from the world, \"[f]rom all the eyes that seemed to stare at the shamed one and pierce him like knives\" (Wursmer: 1981, 53). As a result of the feelings of shame, I became silent another feeling associated with trauma. \"After a traumatic event... [t]he survivor is shocked and confused.... He may become silent and withdrawn\" (Garland: 1998, 112). I could not tell anyone how inadequate I felt because I was afraid that he or she would expose me more thoroughly than I had already been exposed. I kept my secret and hoped that one day I would wnite \"well enough\" for my professors, good so I could be proud of myself. Still, my silence could not protect me from feelings of fear another feeling associated with trauma. I feared writing again and often felt I had nothing to say or write. Gershen Kaufman (1984) writes that \"secondary reactions ... [may] accompany shame or follow shame [and trauma]: fear, hurt or rage. Feeling exposed is often followed by fear of further exposure and further occurrences of shame\" (11). I did not want to hand in another paper that could again expose my bad writing. I resisted writing again because, as Wursmer (1981) has said, \"shame resistance in analysis was exposed as fear of being exposed and laughed at\" (22). I did not want to experience being made to feel or appear inadequate and dumb again. I did not want to perceive myself as a laughing stock. I asked questions such as, \"How did I allow myself to be in this position?\" \"Why do all my friends write better than me? I rationalized the answers or inverted comments that friends and family members might have made, such as \"You are not ready for school.\" \"You are not \"bright\"/ intelligent enough.\" \"How is that you are in university and you can't write?\" \"Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.\" I think I still possess a fear to write academic writing. (In fact, I know I am still fearful but I do it because I have to.) The fear to write caused me many troubles during my school career. My 93 papers were often late. The thought of writing paralyzed me. I wanted to make sure that I understood the question well and that I had a good introduction, lots of time, good ideas and that my words would flow clearly. I also wanted to make sure that the papers were done well, (edited and read over and over), to avoid any criticism of my writing. I felt, as Kaufman (1984) puts it, that if I were perfect I would not be vulnerable (78) so I wanted to be perfect so as to protect myself from wounding comments. Before, I had received the \"hotch-potch\" comment, I did my assignments on time. As back, as I can remember\u2014 in elementary and high school\u2014I did not have a problem with late papers or completing written assignments. Afterward, to deflect my feelings of deficiency in writing expository papers and to protect myself, I told my peers that I was a procrastinator. (There were other problems such as illness that also prevented me from completing certain papers on time.) In understanding more about myself, I realized that I was not a procrastinator, that indeed, the trauma that led to shame and fear about my writing had paralyzed me. I remember being paralyzed by one course that I could not turn in one written assignment all term. In the end, I had to petition to drop the course. Shame induced by trauma can also bring along with it rage. For example, when I read the TA's comment that my conclusion was \"mish mash\" immediately I had a flashback to the \"hotch potch\" comment. I guessed because the words rhymed again and were strong, I felt that my wnting was again attacked and rage swelled in me. Although I reacted badly to the TA, and I am now embarrassed that I did so, I now realize that my rage was a self-protective device. And the instant flash of rage, whether expressed or merely held inside, vitally protects the self against further exposure. When rage predominates in reaction to shame, all that one is shown when approaching the shame-experiencing individual is that very self-protective rage, as though the self were vehemently saying \"keep away!\" In this manner the self protects itself yet paradoxically fights against either comforting of the inner wound or reunion, thereby preventing escape from the inner loneliness. In such a dilemma lies the so often felt hopelessness of the shame-experiencing self (Kaufman: 1984, 11). 94 Without giving much thought to the consequences of my actions, I went into a self-defense mode of anger to protect what confidence I did have in my writing. Without this anger, I would have probably remained \"passive\" as I did before with a \"sense of defeat\" (Young and Gibb: 1998, 81). I did not want the TA to have power over my writing\u2014 I wanted to retain power over my own writing even if I did not have power over the comments and the grade. \"[T]he striving for power is a direct attempt to compensate for the sense of defectiveness which underlies internalized shame\" (Kaufman: 1984, 76). I wanted to show the TA that I believed in myself, that my writing was good regardless of what she said and that I would fight for that respect. Arranging to submit assignments late produced their own fights to resist spiritual wounds. I often had to negotiate with my professors ahead of the due date to obtain extensions so I would not suffer any penalty such as losing marks. The discoveries are important findings for students in the university. I am sure that not all students hand in late papers because of something awful having to do with schoolwork, but there might be some like myself. Before writing this thesis, I did not think I would have discovered all these findings. I hope these findings will benefit administrators, TAs and professors in their roles as evaluators of students' papers. My own experience as a student traumatized about academic writing teaches important lessons about the consequences of one approach to student evaluation for the progress of some students. These students are those who have certain fears and doubts about their own academic abilities, particularly those who recognize that people of their class and ethnic background seldom attend university programs. What my analysis of these comments has taught me is the importance of effective communication in education. As both writers and evaluators of writing, we need to learn how to communicate. I now make the effort to do so. I ask myself questions such as, \"Can I understand what I am trying to say and will others understand?\" Instructors need to ask questions such as 95 \"How can students benefit from our teachings? Am I open to knowing my students? Can we detect when students need help? Will the comment help or hinder students' progress? ...\" Despite their many responsibilities, \"good\" instructors care about their students and should ask those questions or similar ones. Particular care must be taken not to respond to the efforts of a struggling writer with shame inducing techniques: \"shaming a person is the surest way to stifle creativity (Foehr cites Bradshaw: 1997, 58). 96 Chapter 7: Conclusion and Pedagogical Consideration and Recommendation Knowing the Academy Schooling bestows on educators oppressive power and authority while students are given almost none. Some may scoff at the notion of educators as oppressors, but there is no doubt that they have more power, control, and authority than their students (Watkinson: 1997, 3). Looking back on my life as a TYP and undergraduate student, I can now make sense of my use of language and approach to writing, the comments TAs wrote on my papers, the wounds or spiritual awakening I felt from the variety of comments and the techniques I used to survive the experience. While on the thesis journey, I discovered many things about the academy such as the importance of comments and how I fitted into the academy. I now realize that when I first entered the academy, I was not truly prepared for the academic, personal and spiritual challenges to be found there. But neither were many of the other students I met\u2014 we learned and grew, transforming ourselves into the persons we had hoped to become. Everyone came with different learning styles, learning abilities, language usage and writing skills. I did not fully understand what university would be like. All I knew was that, for my battle, I had to read, study, write papers and exams. Also, I did not know I had a \"writing problem\". Before entering university no other teacher had pointed out that my writing was problematic. My English teacher in high school believed in me and validated my writing. Once I had enrolled, however, I discovered that I had to lose my true self, and I experienced a number of feelings\u2014 some good but many bad\u2014 related to language usage in academic writing. My reflection on my experience suggests that some TAs require better training in the assessment of students' papers. Universities, in general, must invest more in the training of TAs. This will be costly as someone will need to teach TAs and the university will have to pay the teacher. 97 Not only could TAs receive more training before entering the classroom but many might also benefit from in-service training. Last year, April 2004, Louise Brown, education reporter for the Toronto Star, reported that Queen's University improved their policy about the training of TAs before they enter the classroom. Brown writes, \"Queen's is ... one of the first to require that graduate students actually be trained for the task of being a teaching assistant.\" This message tells that the other universities are behind in improving the training of TA. Even at universities where training for TAs is provided, I do not think that the training is sufficient. There needs to be more work. For example, the training centre at U of T, does not take into consideration the TA's work schedule; neither do some of the instructors who teach the courses. Thus, if the TA's schedule conflicts with the training sessions then the student might have to wait for the next school term or year to learn new teaching strategies. The U of T TA training centre, was, until recently more concerned with helping students learn new teaching techniques than with understanding students' spirit and emotion. TAs could benefit from better training on students' emotion while advancing their emotional intelligence. One of the principal ways TAs can connect positively with their students is through their comments. Teaching TAs how to comment is important. Commentary requires a skull, it is hard work and it has the potential, when not done with sensitivity and finesse, to be devastating for students. Jean Mason (2003), who teaches Writing Theory at OISE, explains that, \"TAs are given one of the most difficult tasks, that is, to evaluate students' papers\" (class discussion). I agree with Mason. Yet some of them receive no training before entering the classroom and they often write comments the way they saw their own TAs or instructors commented on their papers. As a new TA, I received no training before entering the classroom (even on commenting) but I had the opportunity to observe the instructors' teaching. I must admit, however, that in most departments the instructors for the course often observe the TA in the classroom but here again, the emphasis ts 98 on presentation not on commenting on students' papers. I believe that other universities should adopt Queen's new approach to the training of TAs although I don't know if they train TAs on commenting on students' papers. Some Tips on Commenting Throughout universities, some TAs become future instructors and some instructors also write wounding comments on their students papers. I wonder if insensitive or spiritually impoverished TAs become insensitive and spiritually impoverish instructors. Earlier in the text, I mentioned the TA who decided to be harsh with her students because she was treated harshly. Is it legitimate or reasonable for wounded children to blame their parents for wounding them? wounding of others? I certainly would not. My hurt is mine and in no way should others suffer because of my pain. As TAs, let us all move on from the wounds, the rage and even if we were ill-prepared for our teaching responsibilities. Let us find old or innovative effective ways to communicate by commenting on students' papers. I have a few suggestions on how TAs can avoid writing wounding comments. Here are some: A) Student has many \"errors\" using verbs: Possible comments: = Come and see me at your convenience to discuss your use of verbs. = Revise your use of verbs very carefully before submitting your work. = Record and listen critically to your own reading of your work while editing. B) Student has many spelling \"errors\": Possible comments: = Whenever you have the slightest doubt consult a dictionary. = Practice frequently mis-spelled words with your family and friends. 99 = Any difficulty you have is most likely a common difficulty in class, collaborate with others in your class to overcome these problems. C) Student writes unclear sentences: Possible comments: Read over your work carefully. Read aloud you will sometimes hear when the sentence does not sound clear. If the sentence does not sound right, ask a friend to listen or to read it over. I have done that... and have found doing so very helpful. D) Judgmental comments: This work is not up to the university standard. Possible Comments: I noticed some minor errors in your paper, this is a minor problem and with help from the writing lab, a professor or an editor, you could eliminate this problem in your work. The more you write, the better your writing will get. Did you run out of time editing your paper? I can tell it was done in a hurry. Words to avoid Vague Awkward Develop thought Clarify Irrelevant Mish Mash Hotch potch of confusion... The above words do not tell students what to do or what they have done wrong. Explain to the student why the sentence is vague. Also, if you tell the student that you are the one who does not understand, the student will likely know that his or her meaning is unclear to the reader. Possible Comments: Vague: What do you mean when you say...? You could perhaps add more to this. An example would perhaps be all you need. Awkward: Please rephrase this point. I do not understand tt. Develop thought: What do you mean? Why did this happen'... 100 = Irrelevant: Why do you think this is important? How does this support you main arguments? Would you agree that... would explain this point better? I would have add ... or... because I think these would support your arguments better. Do you agree? = Clarify: [do not understand this point. Please see me so we could discuss it... \u00ab Mish Mash: These sentences coud be more tightly connected in this paragraph. Please see me if you would like to discuss this. \" Hotch Potch of confusion: I do not understand the arguments on page... Please see me. F) TA has nothing positive to say: \u00ab Don't say anything These are some recommendations, but we can all find creative ways or non- wounding ways to help students write better. Most importantly, however, if the TA cannot write something positive or non-wounding it is best to not say anything. A student would rather be spared the pain of a traumatizing comment. I wish the TA who wrote the \"hotch potch\" comment had not said anything. (I guess if he did not, I probably would not have written this thesis.) We must remember that students xed to know how they write and what they do in a positive way. We must remember too that students reed to be validated. We must remember that the spiritual energy in our classrooms will be much better and both student and teacher will connect spiritually. In addition, some students might find intertwining academic work with stories more easy for them. I recommend that universities make more room for story-telling in the universities. Writing Stories and the Spirit I have used the form of story-telling to write this thesis. When I recall my story writing experience, I find that I am no longer upset nor do I feel so wounded about the negative comments as when I first started my research. I think telling my story helped to heal the wounds I suffered. By doing it, I have also discovered many things about myself, about writing, about people and about 101 the academy. I have discovered the wonders of story writing. And I know right now, that there is an awakening within me. I am not yet in a position to name what is happening. I am questioning my whole being and my story writing. I want to know why story writing in my thesis has helped me to feel better about myself and to forgive others and myself. I am recommending that professors encourage more students to write using their personal experiences. Writers such as Allen and Moore talk about the power of writing and the power it has to heal. Yet, part of me, yes that rebellious me, wants to resist giving credit to this powerful act of writing. I want to further probe into other theories to challenge this theory that wnting is truly powerful especially in its healing capabilities. The miracles in this simple act of story writing just seem too effortless in assisting with healing to be real. There must be something more to the process because, if writing stories does so as much for a person, why don't we use it as therapy for many stricken people? Why don't we write more stories in the academy to heal wounds from our bad experiences as teachers and students? My story writing experience has helped me to unearth the pain and allowed me to confront it, forgive those who caused the trauma and given me the courage to continue my journey in life and in the academy. Is this a part of the healing? Joseph Gold (2002) cites Pennebaker (1998) that, \"it is well known in clinical therapy that if patients can be persuaded to write about their negative emotions, thoughts and experiences, they feel better and become healthier\". Studies show that, students who were asked to write about their deepest thoughts and feelings about the most traumatic event in their lives for a short period on four consecutive days showed consistently significant drops in physician visits for illness in the two to six months after the study, in comparison to with control subjects who wrote about trivial matters (Bolton: 1999, cites Penebaker 1998). This must be true. Or, maybe, just maybe I am over-processing what I am doing and feeling. Maybe I need to allow what is happening to me to just happen without a great deal of 102 reflection about it. Maybe then, I will feel the healing and know that my writing is therapeutic. And maybe, I won't have to search for an answer because, perhaps, I already know the answer. Writing stories awakens the spirit. Yet, it seems that some of our instructors have disconnected with their spirits or have forgotten students spirit\u2014 that they have feelings and need to feel good in order to learn. Foehr (1997) states that, As we struggle to have our voices heard within the academy, we hesitate to acknowledge openly the spiritual nature of learning and language. We fear being professionally discounted if we stray from accepted conscious and unconscious definition and convention. We fear being misunderstood or labeled unfairly. We fear the alienation of ourselves and\u2014 worse\u2014 of our ideas from serious consideration by other professional (46). Perhaps, if some of our teachers connect with their spirits, they will discover emotion. Mark Turner (1996) citing Bartlett, reminds us that \"[w]e cannot believe in learning and memory without also believing in emotion.\" According to Foehr, \"spiritually empowering energy should be considered a real force in learning\" (Foehr: 1995, 46), and I agree with him. Writing stories also awakens the spirit to resist trauma in the academy\u2014 the wounds from comments. A strong spirit allows a person to fight. My strong spirit has given me strength to ask for extensions to complete my papers, and to confront authority. A disconnections from the spirit is also a disconnection from the emotion. We need TAs and instructors all over the globe to connect with their spirits in order to connect with their students. Future Study, Questions and Contemplation Thank you for journeying with me. However, before we part, I have some thoughts about some questions and I hope that they will lead to further research. In fact, as I embark on my doctoral journey and as a teaching assistant, I would like to know more about TAs. I would like to interview TAs to determine how they view undergraduate students and their writing. I want to find out how TAs comment on students' papers. I want to investigate the responsibility placed on [us]. 103 Can the work of TAs advance students' writing? Are we properly trained to comment on student's essays? What causes TAs to write negative comments? Are we too underpaid and overworked to really care about our students? What are the kinds of relationships that exist between TAs and their students? What are the reasonable limits and expectations encompassing them? Also, in a macro sense, how do today's academies intend to balance, fund, reward, encourage and revise their dual roles as modern research and teaching institutions? I believe that by writing this thesis, I am partially prepared for the work I now do as a TA and my relationships with my students. Yet I am scared of my responsibilities as a TA: the power I have over my students' grades, the wounding words I could unintentionally write on their papers, the way they look to learn what I have to say\u2014I am scared\u2014 scared of their vulnerabilities. Scared to even write on their fina drafts. But I am trying to do my best and to be the best TAI can be although I know my best probably will not be good enough for all the students. But, I believe, without a doubt, that our education system, will in time, like Queen's University, come up with more policies and more funding to more comprehensively address TAs, students' and instructors' teaching and learning needs. I want to believe that TAs are becoming more cautious about comments they write and how it might affect students' spirits. But my research has yet to be finished and its scope more fully conclusive. Whether the comments on students' papers are just \"rubbish\" or \"garbage\" or \"wads of hog wash\" or \"mish-mash\" or \"hotch-potch of confusion\", they demonstrate one thing\u2014 power, a power over others, a power to degrade, a power to wound, a power to injure a student's spirit. Regardless of the markers' intentions, we all know that words can would deeply. But words can also uplift us. Lemke emphasizes the power of words. He states, 104 When we think of power in the social world, we imagine the power to do things; the power to buy and sell, to command obedience, to reward and punish, to give or take, to do good to others or do them harm, physically or emotionally. In all of these, language can and often does playa critical role. We know that we do not need 'sticks and stones' to hurt others; words can cause pain that cuts just as deeply. The language we speak to ourselves decides whom we will help or hurt, and when. The language we speak to others can enlist their aid or provoke their enmity. The language others speak to us, from childhood, shapes the attitudes and beliefs that ground how we use all our powers of action (Lemke: 1995, 4). As TAs or instructors, let us acknowledge the power of words. Let us acknowledge our students' feelings. Let us communicate and connect with one another as human beings with our hearts, spirits and souls. Let us learn how to humanize the academy even when it is hard to do so. Let us remember that language and writing come from different voices, that our comments should reflect our awareness of both, that we should resist the temptations to wound, making the academy a less traumatic learning site. As well, students traumatized in the academy must continue to resist mistreatment and fight for respect. They must keep on trudging to achieve their academic goals and to see their traumas as lessons learned so they may see the future as opportunity to heal the past. It has taken me a long time, but I can finally say I am, in a sense, not angry for the traumas I suffered in the academy. After the hurt, I have learned from them, been fueled by them and I now plunge forward in hopes that others may learn to do the same as I continue to bring awareness to the complexities in writing comments. 105 Bibliography Abramovitch, Rona.
