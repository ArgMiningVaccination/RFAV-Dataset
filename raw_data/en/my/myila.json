Good detox capability moves out waste, poisons and toxic substances which can help your body release extra weight. When we talk about detoxification, we're not referring to difficult cleanses, painful purges or lengthy fasts. Instead, we mean bolstering your body's own built-in detox systems, which are surprisingly efficient if they have what they need every day. Effective weight loss is often connected to good detox abilities. You can be proactive about fueling your detoxification with our 5-step plan to ensure your detox systems get what they need during the active weight loss process. Detoxification clears your body of toxins to help shed excess weight Your body's detox capability is an important player when you are trying to lose excess weight. Studies have shown that having a blockage that affects the way the body remove toxins is a secondary cause of obesity. Unfortunately, all sorts of factors can affect your ability to detox well. If detox continues to be affected, there can be a \"tipping point\" effect that makes it harder to let go of weight. Toxicity can lead to weight gain in women of all ages but it can be especially problematic for women who are already experiencing [ hormonal fluctuations](/weight-loss/weight-loss-hormonal-imbalance/) in perimenopause and menopause. Here's why: hormones act as messengers that \"tell\" cells and organs what to do and this includes sending important signals for your body to get rid of waste and toxins. Hormones are produced and broken down along specific metabolic pathways in your body. When your metabolic pathways are burdened by toxins and waste material, it's much harder for your cells to communicate effectively and that can lead to [ weight gain in menopause](/menopause-and-perimenopause/demystifying-perimenopause-weight-gain/). Key signs you need to detox - I am gaining weight, even though I'm not overeating. - I consume caffeine and/or alcohol on a daily basis. - I'm often constipated (two to three times a week). - I'm very sensitive to medications; I usually only take a half dose. - I often have a stuffy nose/congestion, and/or postnasal drip. - I eat too much junk and candy. - I have problem skin and/or rosacea. - I used to tolerate caffeine and alcohol much better than I do now. - I'm sensitive to chemical and environmental odors and perfumes; I get headaches in certain stores or offices. 5 steps to start detox-ing for weight loss When you're detoxifying, you're clearing the natural pathways that manage toxins. That allows your body to [ release stress](/weight-loss/high-stress-equals-more-cravings-and-weight-gain/), keep your hormones balanced and let go of weight. Some of these steps can take a little getting used to so start by choosing just one and add more when you feel ready. 1. Clean up your diet for a week \u2014 or two. Get rid of processed and sugary foods. This is challenging but it will have swift and positive effects on your detox ability. Don't buy items with sugar, syrup, alcohol, caffeine, artificial sweeteners or additives. While you're at it, skip the grilled or charbroiled meats. 2. Fill your plate with detoxifying foods. Boost your body's ability to get rid of toxins and extra weight by eating foods like alfalfa sprouts, brown rice, dark green veggies, lemon, garlic, oats, millet, root vegetables, broccoli, kale and seeds. Season with garlic and turmeric and eat organic, fresh food as often as possible. Always wash and rinse fruits and vegetables. Drink plenty of water to help move out the bad stuff. 3. Activate the detoxing power of your lungs. When you breathe deeply, you push out toxins and your lungs get the full exchange of oxygen for carbon dioxide. Try this: take three, slow deep breaths in and out your nose. Aim for three-second inhales, hold for three-seconds, and exhale for three-seconds. Feels good, right? Start each day with 10 of these deep, detoxifying breaths. 4. Add detoxifying supplements. Include herbs like milk thistle, kudzu, turmeric with black pepper, [ absorbable curcumin](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/super-c-plus) and dandelion to boost your natural detoxification pathways. Make sure you're getting basic nutrition every day from [ a good multivitamin](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/essential-nutrients-multivitamin), and some extra [ calcium and magnesium](https://shop.womenshealthnetwork.com/products/better-bones-basics).
