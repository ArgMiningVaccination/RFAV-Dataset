The program will teach you how to make thoughtful and thorough decisions about developing your career. The Advanced Herbal Course opens with a unit on Herbal Wisdom Traditions and History which sets the stage for the entire course and incorporates the history and wisdom of various traditions of herbalism and how they have informed the art and science of Western herbalism. Thorough and in-depth learning opportunities cover topics such as: As a student, you will be exposed to case studies throughout the course which will highlight the larger clinical concepts of the lessons presented. Students will also learn more about client assessment and intake procedures, the philosophy of healing, and legal considerations for the practicing herbalist. The Advanced Herbal Course is a natural extension of the Intermediate Herbal Course, continuing the discussion on body systems with deep discussion of the blood/lymph, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems, and exploring in more depth topics touched upon in the previous programs. This program is representative of the depth and rigor that you require as you devise your own business or clinical practice. The Advanced Course will equip you with the knowledge and tools you need prior to gaining hands-on clinical experience with a local clinical herbalist or mentor. Program Details The Advanced Herbal Course requires students to successfully pass 14 quizzes with a score of 80% or higher. In addition to reading and studying the lesson material throughout the course and passing the quizzes at the end of each unit, the course includes unit exercises and a monograph project to be completed on a self-study basis. The unit exercises have been developed to help students engage with and explore lesson content in more detail. The monograph project guides you through developing plant monographs for 15-20 herbs of your own choosing. We recommend choosing 3-4 herbs discussed in each body system unit or wellness unit in the course and experiencing and researching each of these herbs, compiling the information into plant monographs. Upon successful passage of all quizzes, students will be notified of their graduation with a signed certificate of completion. While this program is self-paced, students are expected to complete the Advanced Herbal Course in under 3 years. The 3-year clock is triggered with the action to \"Start\" the course (not at enrollment). We expect students to work on their studies at the rate of approximately 1-2 months per unit. We understand that special circumstances or life events may delay your studies, so we will offer extension options upon request for a small fee. The Advanced Herbal Course has been designed to prepare students for the hands-on clinical training that will be necessary prior to opening their own practices as professional herbal practitioners. Those who wish to pursue that path are encouraged to work or apprentice locally alongside a practicing professional herbalist, with the understanding that obtaining clinical hours and even additional course training is advised before opening their own practice. This program will include recommendations and resources for taking these next steps. The Advanced Herbal Course will benefit students interested in growing in their holistic health careers, expanding on their studies from the Intermediate Herbal Course, developing herbal products businesses, and offering herbalism education. Benefits of this Course The Advanced Herbal Course Outline UNIT 1: HERBAL WISDOM TRADITIONS AND HISTORY Introduction; The Humoral System; Western Energetics in Contemporary Practice; Roots America; The American Botanical Movement; Chinese Medicine; Ayurveda; Global Healing Traditions In honoring those who have come before us and paved the way for herbalism into modern times, the course begins by setting the stage with the unfolding history and herbal wisdom traditions which have shaped Western herbalism: from the rich historical knowledge developed within the humoral system of the ancient Greeks, Chinese medicine, and Ayurveda to the burgeoning discoveries of the American botanical movement as it was influenced by Indigenous and European systems of healing and the many and diverse healing traditions across the globe. The course explores the frames through which many cultures have integrated plants into a holistic approach to wellness, grounding our current and ever-expanding knowledge in all that has come before. UNIT 2: BOTANY AND PHYTOCHEMISTRY Plant Identification and Taxonomy; Plant Chemistry; Pharmacognosy and Pharmacology; Herb-Drug Interactions; How to Evaluate Scientific Research This unit focuses on the hard sciences of botany, taxonomy, and pharmacology in order to prepare students of herbalism with the tools necessary to identify herbs in the field, to understand and evaluate scientific research regarding phytochemistry and herb-drug interactions, and to celebrate the knowledge that scientific research brings to the traditions of herbalism. This unit will assist in bringing detail to our understanding of the intelligence of the plants themselves and how this intelligence communicates with that of the human body. UNIT 3: MAKING AND SELLING HERBAL PRODUCTS Sourcing Herbs; Good Manufacturing Practices; Labeling Herbal Products; Creating a Business and a Brand This unit is geared for those who want to develop an herbal products business, and includes information on sourcing herbs sustainably, detailed guidance on complying with good manufacturing practices and legal requirements for labeling in the U.S., and helpful business advice on creating a brand from an herbalist who has done so successfully. The course will get you started in the right direction, giving you valuable information up front to help guide you through the process and save time, money, and frustration down the road. UNIT 4: BLOOD, LYMPH, AND MUCOUS MEMBRANES Anatomy Review; Hemodynamics and Membrane Physiology; Common Conditions; Herbs and Healing; Case Study In addition to performing their own unique functions, the blood, lymph, and mucous membranes have in common the vitally important function of working in unison to defend your body from exposure to foreign elements. The mucous membranes cover all internal body surfaces that have direct exposure to elements of the outside environment. Along with the blood, the lymphatic system is responsible for herding immune cells quickly and efficiently toward invading pathogens. Recognizing common conditions that could compromise these systems is an important skill for clinical herbalists. This unit explores the anatomy and physiology, common complaints, etiology of imbalances, and herbal therapeutic approaches appropriate for the blood, the lymph system, and mucous membranes. UNIT 5: THE ENDOCRINE SYSTEM Anatomy: Major players and Messengers; Physiology: The Ultimate Messaging System; General Health and Wellness: Don't Shoot the Messengers; Common Conditions of the Endocrine System When we think about maintaining endocrine system health, many of us think of the most common culprit of endocrine imbalance: stress. Whether from environmental, emotional, nutritional, or socioeconomic factors, the impact of chronic stress can have a significant impact on the endocrine system and the body systems that the endocrine system is connected to\u2014essentially, all of them! Because of the commonplace nature of chronic stress, having an in-depth understanding of the endocrine system and its associated imbalances is paramount for the modern clinical herbalist. This unit explores the anatomy and physiology of the endocrine system, how to support the general health and wellness of this system, common complaints, etiology of imbalances, and conventional and herbal therapeutic approaches. UNIT 6: MALE HEALTH AND WELLNESS The Male Reproductive System; Boys: Youth through Puberty; Cultural and Social Aspects of Male Care; General Health Care; The Male Heart; The Prostate; Male Hormone Balance; Male Stressors and Other Common Complaints; Case Study Unit 6 focuses on what it is like to live in the male body and how to care for it, beginning in this lesson with male anatomy and physiology of the reproductive system. This unit also takes a thorough look at the heart and discusses general wellness support for both boys and men. The unit covers support for many common physical and emotional imbalances men may experience. UNIT 7: FEMALE HEALTH AND WELLNESS Menstrual Cycle and Reproductive Potential; Girls Wellness; The Psychology of Female Wellness; General Health Care for Women; Breast Health; Common Female Complaints; Fertility, Pregnancy, Miscarriage, and Birth; Managing the Menopausal Transition; Case Study Cultivating sensitivity and openness to the diversity among humans and their bodies are essential skills for clinicians, and this is particularly true in developing clinical skills in supporting uterine-ovarian health in clients seeking herbal and nutritional care. This unit takes a thorough look at the anatomy and physiology of the female reproductive system, and discusses general wellness support for both girls and women, provides information on support for common physical and emotional imbalances women may experience, support for breast health, fertility, pregnancy, miscarriage, and birth; and takes an in-depth look at the menopausal transition and herbal strategies for support. UNIT 8: THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM Anatomy and Physiology of Bones, Tendons, and Ligaments;Anatomy and Physiology of Muscles; General Health and Wellness of the Musculoskeletal System; Common Conditions and the Herbal Approach; Managing Pain; Case Study Understanding the various ways that tendons, ligaments, connective tissue, and bone interact with the entire body can aid us in determining the best way to offer a full-body support plan. Having a clear understanding of the role of the bones in immune function and how these tissues are involved in body-wide nutrient balance can offer a view of the overall health of the musculoskeletal system. With these tools, an herbalist can offer a more health- and wellness-based protocol rather than one based on curing dis-ease. This unit explores the anatomy and physiology of the bones, tendons, ligaments, and muscles of the musculoskeletal system; general health and wellness of this system; and investigates herbal support for common conditions as well as how to manage pain and inflammation associated with the musculoskeletal system. UNIT 9: HEALTHY AGING WITH HERBS Longevity, Vitality, and Prevention; Working with Elders: Important Considerations; for the Herbal Consultation; The Aging Skin; Illness and Disease of an Aging Population Imprinted on our DNA is the potential to survive. While our bodies eventually age and decay, our bodies still move through life with an impetus to move toward vitality and longevity. Immortality may never be our birthright\u2014looking toward traditional viewpoints regarding the gifts and purpose of aging, any fountain of youth would be out of place. However, whatever our age or stage of life, we are able to employ specific lifestyle adaptations, dietary choices, and health-supportive mindsets that can help us to avoid age-associated illness and disease and add vitality, wellness, and enjoyment to our lives. This unit discusses what it means to age, the energetics of aging, and herbal support for vitality in the aging process; takes a thoughtful look at important perspectives and considerations when conducting an herbal consultation with elders; looks at the anatomy, physiology, and herbal support for aging skin; and discusses common physical imbalances that accompany aging and herbal therapeutics to support them. UNIT 10: WEIGHT MANAGEMENT FOR HEALTH AND WELLNESS Overweight and Obesity; The Brain-Gut Connection and Psychology of Food; The Energetics of Food; Sugar; Common Food Allergies and Sensitivities; Fasting and Detox; Daily Living with Powerful Herbs; Dieting Because nutrition is at the root of vibrant wellness, this unit dives into weight management for health, exploring the causes and effects of obesity, the fascinating brain-gut connection and energetics of food, the effect of sugar on the body, understanding food allergies and food sensitivities, and supporting a return to optimum body function via fasting and detox, healthy dieting, and integration of herbs into the daily diet. By taking a holistic wellness approach with clients and focusing on health rather than weight, herbalists can teach that weight is only one component of health. It might be difficult to advance this philosophy with the entrenched media, stereotypes, and what our society thinks we know of weight and obesity, but our clients will appreciate it and benefit. UNIT 11: HEALING The Nature of Healing; The Mind-Body Connection; Reaching the Spirit; Aromatherapy Take a broad look at some of the determinants that influence the nature of healing. While healing is dynamic and looks different for each individual, there are basic similarities in our wellness needs. Healing involves engaging the mind, body, and spirit. There is value in connection - to our own thought processes, to humanity, and to the natural world. The beauty of working with herbs along this path is that the very nature of herbalism connects us to resources and experiences that support healing on all of these levels. This unit explores the nature and philosophy of physical and emotional healing, the importance of the mind-body connection and how it is understood in different systems of healing, how emotional conditions affect physical health and ways to reach the emotional body or spirit, and takes a thorough look at aromatherapy and how to safely use essential oils. UNIT 12: ASSESSMENT AND HERBAL THERAPEUTICS Assessing the Body; Clinical Intake; Advanced Formulation An important skill for clinical herbalists is to be able to differentiate between one person and the next and to match the profile of an herb to a person and their state of balance. Each person is different and we need to make room for and understand their differences. Evaluation is a long and difficult education, but don't worry! There are lots of opportunities to learn. This unit explores the practical skills of assessing the body using energetic and tissue state frameworks, tongue, face, and pulse assessment techniques, the clinical intake process, and advanced herbal formulation. UNIT 13: BECOMING AN HERBALIST Defining your Path; Receiving Clinical Training and Experience; Cultivating a Healing Presence; Continuing to Grow; Useful Resources and Organizations As an herbalist, your path will evolve over time. One of the most beautiful things about herbalism is the way that each individual is able to express themself through their practice. There are many different ways to be an herbalist, and each person has different strengths, interests, and preferences that become an integral part of their path. This unit explores how to define your path as an herbalist, how to seek and receive additional clinical training and experience, how to cultivate an authentic healing presence and communicate that to your clients, and how to continue to grow your skill set throughout your career. UNIT 14: YOU ARE AN HERBALIST Introduction to Clinical Practice; Herbalism and the Law; Client Records and Confidentiality; The Client/Practitioner Relationship Now that you have gotten your feet wet with key aspects of clinical training and practice, it's time for the fun part: envisioning and creating your own herbal practice!

This is the time to put a lot of your herbal training aside for a bit and focus on the ideal business you'd like to create for yourself and how to put it together. This unit will help you gain an understanding of what a clinical practice entails, how to acquire clinical training, what your legal responsibilities are, and how to run a practice, from keeping client records to developing intake procedures, and cultivating effective working relationships with your clients.
