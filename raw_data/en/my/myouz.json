Verywell Fit / Lecia Landis We recommend meeting as many of your nutrient needs as possible through eating a balanced and varied diet, but there are certain instances supplementing with vitamins, minerals, or other supplements may be needed. If you have a diagnosed deficiency, experience malabsorption issues, or consume a limited or restrictive diet, you may benefit from a vitamin or mineral supplement. Additionally, there are certain life stages that have increased nutrient needs. For example, pregnant and breastfeeding women, athletes, and older adults all have unique nutritional needs that might benefit from supplementation of certain nutrients. If a healthcare provider has recommended a particular supplement or multiple supplements, \"It is important to choose vitamin brands that do extensive testing, ideally by a third party. You should also check for supplements with high-quality ingredients that lack fillers or unnecessary additives,\" says Jamie Gershel, MS, RD. When selecting our top picks, we prioritized brands with research backed formulations and dosages, internal and third-party testing, sourcing transparency and overall ingredient quality and brand integrity.

Groups who may benefit from vitamin, mineral, or other nutrient supplements include: Those who consume limited or restricted diets that may not be adequate in certain vitamins, minerals, and nutrients, such as those who are vegetarian or vegan, or those who do not eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, proteins, dairy, nuts, or seeds, may benefit from certain vitamin, mineral, or nutrient supplements. Those with absorption issues: If you have a condition that limits your absorption of certain nutrients, you will likely benefit from supplementation. Those with a diagnosed deficiency: Vitamin deficiencies can occur for a variety of reasons, such as if you follow a restrictive diet or have poor absorption due to certain conditions or medications. If you are diagnosed with a vitamin deficiency via a blood test, a healthcare provider may recommend using a vitamin supplement. They will be able to suggest a recommended dose and form appropriate for your needs. Those who are pregnant or breastfeeding: The Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for pregnant women is slightly higher for certain nutrients. Some of the nutrients needed to support a healthy pregnancy include calcium, iron, choline, omega-3 fats, vitamin C, and the B vitamins including folic acid. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you are at greater risk of nutrient deficiency, and prenatal vitamins are essential. Older adults: Adults over age 50 may benefit from vitamin supplements if they cannot meet their needs through food due to decreased appetite or other reasons. As we age, our absorption of certain vitamins diminishes. It is important to speak with a healthcare provider to ensure that supplements do not interact with any medications you're taking. Who May Not Benefit from Vitamin Supplements There are many different types of vitamin supplements on the market, and whether or not you will benefit from one is highly individual and dependent on your diet, lifestyle, and health status, and on whether you take certain medications. It's important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any supplements to ensure that they are safe and meet your individual needs. People who eat a well-balanced diet. If you eat a varied diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, or dairy, and a mix of protein-rich foods like beans, fish, tofu, poultry, and meat, you are likely meeting your nutrient needs through your diet. People with certain medical conditions. Some supplements can make medical conditions worse, so it's best to check with your healthcare provider before starting on any supplement. People taking certain medications. Supplements may interact with medications, so if you are taking any medications, check with your healthcare provider before starting on a supplement. How We Select Supplements Our team works hard to be transparent about why we recommend certain supplements; you can read more about our dietary supplement methodology here. We support supplements that are evidence-based and rooted in science. We value certain product attributes that we find to be associated with the highest quality products. It's important to note that the FDA does not review dietary supplements for safety and effectiveness before they go to market. Our team of experts has created a detailed, science-backed methodology to choose the supplements we recommend. Additionally, we spoke with several Registered Dietitians, including Jamie Gershel, MS, RD, who specializes in weight management, diabetes, heart health, mental health and hormonal conditions like PCOS. What to Look For Third-Party Testing Supplements that are third-party tested are sent to a lab, where they are tested to ensure that they contain what they say they contain and are not contaminated with specific high-risk contaminants. However, it's important to note: Third-party testing does not test to see whether a product is effective or safe for everyone, and it does not ensure the supplement will not interact with other supplements or medications. Not all third-party testing is created equal. It is not uncommon for supplement companies to pay labs for certificates after conducting minimal or no testing. The third-party certifications we trust are: ConsumerLab.com, NSF, and USP. However, these certifications are difficult to obtain and/or expensive for manufacturers, so many companies choose not to get their products tested by one of these three organizations. Sometimes products tested by these three companies are more expensive, as a way to try to offset the cost they pay for certification. Just because a supplement is not tested by one of these three companies, that does not mean it's a bad product. We recommend doing some research on the reputation of the manufacturer, and calling up the manufacturer and its testing lab to determine their protocols and decide whether you feel comfortable consuming the supplement. When in doubt, consult a registered dietitian or nutritionist to further assist you with verifying whether or not you need a supplement and, if so, to help you find the right one for you. Form Vitamin supplements come in varying forms, including capsules, liquids, chewables, gummies, powders, and sprays. Gummies and liquid forms may be beneficial for those who have trouble swallowing capsules, such as children or older adults. However, some liquid supplements may require refrigeration, and some gummies contain added sugars. Certain brands offer supplements in different forms, so you can base your choice on personal preference. The form of the vitamin itself will vary among vitamins and brands, so you should check the label of your brand of choice. Ingredients and Potential Interactions It is essential to carefully read the ingredient list and the nutrition facts panel of a supplement to know which ingredients are present and how much of each ingredient is included, relative to the recommended daily value of that ingredient. Please take the supplement label to a healthcare provider to review the different ingredients contained in the supplement and any potential interactions between these ingredients and other supplements and medications you or your child is taking. Herbal blends: Some vitamin brands include herbs in their ingredient lists. If you are taking medications or other supplements, you should check with a healthcare provider before using vitamins with these ingredients in them to avoid unwanted interactions. Certain herbs can reduce efficacy of particular medications or cause other unwanted side effects. Dosage Always speak with a healthcare professional before adding a supplement to your routine, to ensure that it is appropriate for your individual needs and to understand which dosage to take. Dosage will vary, depending on what vitamin supplement you are taking and why. For each vitamin, there is a recommended dietary allowance (RDA) or adequate intake level (AI) as well as a tolerable upper limit (UL), which you can find via the National Institutes of Health. Follow dosage recommendations provided by a healthcare provider. How Much Is Too Much? It is important to ensure that you are taking the proper dose for a given vitamin. The upper limits for different vitamins are established by the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements. The water-soluble vitamins, which include vitamin C and the B vitamins, are not likely to become toxic, because our bodies will excrete excess amounts. Fat-soluble vitamins, which include vitamins A, D, E, and K, can become toxic at high doses. Be sure to consult with a healthcare provider to find the dose that is right for you and opt for a reputable vitamin brand. Frequently Asked Questions What is the best brand of vitamin B12? Vitamin B12 is involved in nervous system functioning, energy metabolism, blood cell formation, and other body functions. If you follow a vegan or vegetarian diet, you may be at increased risk of a B12 deficiency, since the main food sources of vitamin B12 include meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products, and you will likely benefit from a supplement. Older adults may also be at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency, because it is common to have a decreased ability to absorb this vitamin. Some brands we like include Thorne Research, Pure Encapsulations, and Nature Made. Learn More: How Vitamin B12 Deficiency Affects the Body What vitamin brands are made in the USA? Many vitamin brands source ingredients from around the world and manufacture their products in the United States. From among the recommended brands we listed here, Thorne Research manufactures many of its products in the USA, and Pure Encapsulations, Klean Athlete, mykind Organics, Nature Made, and SmartyPants produce their vitamins in the USA with ingredients that are both domestic and imported. Are store vitamin brands good quality? Store vitamin brands can be good-quality, but it is important to search for third-party testing and transparency regarding quality practices, and to review ingredient lists. If you are uncertain about a particular vitamin brand, consult with a healthcare provider. Is there really a difference between vitamin brands? As the FDA only minimally regulates vitamins, each vitamin brand stands as a uniquely separate entity. There is no single organization that oversees all vitamins, so each brand is different from the next when it comes to third-party testing, quality control, ingredients, and even vitamin forms and dosing. Is it bad to switch prenatal vitamin brands partway through my pregnancy? If you find that you do not like your prenatal vitamin due to reasons such as dosing requirements or capsule size, or if you are lacking in a certain vitamin, and your supplement does not supply an adequate level, you may want to switch brands. You should, however, consult with a healthcare provider to determine your vitamin needs during pregnancy. Why Trust Verywell Fit Tamar Kane, MS, RD is a registered dietitian and marathon runner.
