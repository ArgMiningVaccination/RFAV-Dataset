Annual Report Fiscal Year 2014 1The Alaska Commission on Aging (ACoA) is pleased to present this annual report describing the work of the Commission in FY2014. The Commission believes that all older Alaskans should have the opportunity to participate meaningfully in their communities, to be valued for their contributions, and to have access to services which maintain health and independence so that they may enjoy a high quality of life and live safely at home and in the community for as long as possible. To steer the journey and achieve successful aging, a \"roadmap\" is needed to show a productive pathway toward a high quality of life. The \"Alaska State Plan for Senior Services, FY2016-2019\" that is under construction and the recently completed \"Alaska Roadmap to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias\" are roadmaps that we can use to reach the desired destination of healthy and productive aging for all Alaska seniors. On May 1, 2014, the Commission with the support of many partners hosted the Power of Aging in Alaska Symposium in Anchorage as the kick-off celebration for \"Older Americans Month in Alaska.\" The purpose of this event was to provide Alaska seniors and those who care about them with the information and tools they need to have a strong voice in making Alaska the best place in which to live and grow old with dignity. We appreciate the support from ConocoPhillips Alaska, the Department of Health and Social Services, Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, the University of Alaska Anchorage, AARP Alaska, the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, and all of the speakers who shared their knowledge and expertise at this conference. This private-public partnership made the Symposium a successful event in which 145 people attended. Alaska seniors are vital to the future of Alaska. As a growing population, Alaska's older adults have significant power that can be exercised in a variety of ways. During her welcome remarks as presented below, ACoA's Chair Mary Shields described \"senior power\" and called out to seniors to use their power and make a positive difference to benefit all Alaskans regardless of age. People often refer to the growth of the senior population as the silver tsunami. I am one of the more than 1 16,900 Alaskans who comprise the Silver Tsunami. Watch out - our numbers are growing! Alaska seniors are vital to the future of Alaska as we have enormous power. We want to share with you a few examples of senior power. Mary Shields ACoA Chair, Public Member Anchorage Plan your retirement, don 't let it just \" happen\" to you. Prepare financially - prepare socially. Get involved with non-profit causes that appeal to you and develop friends and activities in those areas.Alaska Commission on Aging FY 2014 Annual Report http://www.alaskaaging.org/ 2 Alaska Commission on AgingDemographic Power: \u0097 Seniors are the fastest growing population and comprise the largest percentage of all ages in Alaska. Back in the 70s and earlier, Alaska had the youngest demographic - but that was more than 40 years ago and many of us who arrived in Alaska back then are still here. It is our responsibility, baby boomers and seniors, to ensure that Alaska is the best place for its seniors to live. Economic Power: \u0097 Seniors contribute to the health of the economy. We spend money and a lot of it by investing more than $2.4 billion into the economy annually from retirements, pensions, Social Security and savings on our living expenses, health care, entertainment, and gifts for our children and grandchildren, many of whom also live in Alaska. Political Power: \u0097 Seniors are \"super voters\" as we vote in almost every election - for national, state, and local officials. Seniors volunteer on campaigns, work on initiatives and generate dialogue on many issues facing Alaska. Through our voting power and outreach activities, seniors help shape Alaska's political landscape. Are we talking about senior issues to our government officials and those running for office? If not, we should be. Social Power: \u0097 Seniors love their families - their children and grandchildren, nieces and nephews, brothers and sisters. Seniors are devoted family caregivers who take care of their grandchildren and adult children as needed, and they assist each other when health and lives change. Seniors also care about the communities where they live and serve on boards of nonprofit organizations. They deliver meals to the homebound - and do whatever needs to be done to support local charities and service organizations. Generational Power: \u0097 Seniors have lived long and seen a lot during their lifetimes. As a result, they have learned life lessons along the way from both their successes and mistakes. For this reason, seniors are Alaska's tradition-bearers, pioneers, and mentors who link the past with the present and can help prepare future generations by offering wisdom and guidance to keep things moving forward in a positive direction. Edna DeVries ACoA Commissioner, Public Member, Palmer What do you think is the most pressing issue affecting Alaska seniors today? The price of oil because it affects not only seniors but their families who are very important to us seniors.Annual Report Fiscal Year 2014 3There are many needs in our home communities and within our great state that deserve attention and energy from the senior community. Don't complain when things don't get done. Don't be a couch potato and sit on the sidelines. You can make a difference if you choose to get involved and make your voice heard. You have a lifetime of experience, knowledge and wisdom to share. Be active, take a stand, and be part of the solution to effect positive change that will benefit all Alaskans, young and old!

The Department of Health and Social Services is the federally designated State Unit on Aging. The responsibilities that come with this designation are carried out by the Division of Senior and Disabilities Services with the Alaska Commission on Aging. The Commission also collaborates with other State agencies and partners to improve the quality of life for older Alaskans. Charged by statute, ACoA makes recommendations directly to the Governor, the Legislature, and the Administration regarding legislation, regulations, and appropriations for programs and services benefiting Alaska seniors. The Commission is authorized to develop the four-year comprehensive Alaska State Plan for Senior Services required by the U.S. Administration on Community Living/Administration on Aging for all states receiving federal funds from the Older Americans Act. In addition, the Commission serves as an advisory board to the Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority regarding issues and budget needs for Trust beneficiaries who are older Alaskans with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, behavioral health conditions, mental illness, developmental disabilities, and brain injury. The Commission consists of eleven members, seven of whom are public members (with six members being 60 years and older) appointed by the Governor to serve four-year terms. Two seats are filled by the Commissioners of the Department of Health and Social Services and the Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development, or their designees. The remaining seats are reserved for the Chair of the Pioneer Home Advisory Board and a senior services provider, regardless of age. The ACoA is supported by an office staff of four that includes the Executive Director, two Planners, and an Administrative Assistant.FY 2014 Alaska Commission on Aging Members Mary Shields Chair, Public Member, Anchorage Rolf Numme Vice Chair, Public Member, Wasilla David Blacketer Public Member, Kodiak Marie Darlin Public Member, Juneau Edna DeVries Public Member, Palmer Eleanor Dementi Public Member, Cantwell Anna Frank Public Member, Fairbanks Rachel Greenberg Senior Service Provider, Palmer Banarsi Lal Alaska Pioneer Home Advisory Board Chair, Fairbanks Duane Mayes Director, Senior and Disabilities Services, Department of Health and Social Services, Anchorage Paula Pawlowski Executive Director, Serve Alaska, Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development Anchorage Bob Sivertsen Alaska Pioneer Home Advisory Board Chair, Ketchikan (Sept 2014) 7 Public Seats 2 Department Designees 1 Pioneer Home Advisory Board 1 Senior Service Provider 2 Health Planners 1 Executive Director 1 Administrative Assistant ACoA Commissioners ACoA Staff Alaska Commission on AgingAnnual Report Fiscal Year 2014 5Alaska's Roadmap to Address Alzheimer's Disease & Related Dementias The Roadmap is Alaska's first state plan to address the multiple and complex challenges that Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) presents to individuals, families, caregivers and the long-term care system as a whole. Alzheimer's disease is an incurable and fatal disease that tragically affects an increasing number of older Alaskans and their families as our senior population continues to boom. Through statewide family caregiver forums, a family caregiver survey, and public input at other venues, stakeholders have pointed out gaps in the existing system of support services and residential options to serve individuals and caregivers, particularly as the number of people living with dementia increases over the coming years. An estimated 9 percent of Alaska seniors 65 and older have Alzheimer's disease. The projected number of individuals over age 65 with Alzheimer's will grow from 6,100 in 2014 to 1 1,000 in 2025: These projections do not include the number of people with related dementias (including vascular dementia, Parkinson's disease, Lewy Body dementia, and other forms) and those younger than 65. The Roadmap was developed by a core team of agencies that included the Alaska Commission on Aging, Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority, Alzheimer's Resource Agency of Alaska, and several divisions under the Department of Health and Social Services including the Division of Senior & Disabilities Services, the Division of Pioneer Homes, the Division of Public Health, and the Division of Behavioral Health along with support from AARP Alaska and the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman.FY 2014 Alaska Commission on Aging Staff Denise Daniello, Executive Director Jon Erickson, Planner II Lesley Thompson, Planner I Sherice Cole, Administrative Assistant II Contact Us Alaska Commission on Aging Department of Health & Social Services Physical address: 150 Third Street, #103Juneau, Alaska 99801 Mailing address: and older with Alzheimer's 6 Alaska Commission on Aging Duane Mayes ACoA Commissioner, Director of Senior & Disabilities Services, Anchorage We are an aging state and the Commission on Aging will need to work with senior stake holders to address a broad array of long term cares services. Some of our biggest challenges are to address transportation and supportive housing services for Alaskan seniors in urban and rural communities. There is a gap in the continuum of long term care services where we as a state are challenged to serve Alaskan seniors who experience dementia. The opportunity to address gaps in long term care services is now. With the state moving forward with Medicaid expansion and reform, it is critical that the Commission work closely with the Department of Health & Social Services. The Roadmap offers this vision, mission & set of guiding principles to guide the ACoA and the core team agency partners to plan and implement services for the well-being of Alaskans impacted by Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Vision: Alaska will identify Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementias as a public health priority due to the increasing number of Alaskans affected, and will build strong partnerships to address the challenges of this condition with safe and quality supports, from prevention, early detection, to end of life. Mission: To improve public awareness; promote prevention and early detection; increase access to necessary long-term services and supports; improve availability of safe, appropriate housing; and increase caregiver supports for all Alaskans with Alzheimer's disease and Related Dementias. Guiding Principles: Early detection and planning can vastly improve quality of \u0097 life and ease the financial burden for individuals with ADRD and their caregivers. Individuals with ADRD should be able to reside in their \u0097 homes and communities for as long as possible.While the incidence of ADRD increases in Alaska, we \u0097 must address costs by providing services to people at the earliest stage possible and seek to serve people in the least restrictive and most appropriate care setting.Annual Report Fiscal Year 2014 7In addition, the Roadmap identifies six goals with corresponding recommendations to provide a guide to the State and other organizations with a mission to improve the quality of life for Alaskans with ADRD and their caregivers. Promote public awareness, prevention and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Increase opportunities for public education about \u0097 Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Increase awareness of and access to ADRD resources. \u0097 Increase frequency of early screening and diagnosis. \u0097 Improve access to appropriate housing, services, and supports for individuals with ADRD at all stages of the disease. Develop service eligibility requirements based on functional, \u0097 cognitive, and behavioral needs and reimbursement rates based on acuity levels. Maintain individuals with ADRD in the least restrictive and \u0097 most appropriate care setting possible. Develop housing options for people with ADRD. \u0097 Identify the Department of Health and Social Services \u0097 funding needs required to ensure access and to meet the needs of the rapidly growing population of those with ADRD in Alaska. Optimize the role of the Pioneer Homes within the statewide \u0097 array of long-term services and supports.Increase access to end of life care. \u0097 Optimize quality, safety, and efficiency of services to people with ADRD. Ensure safety in private homes and communities for persons \u0097 with ADRD. Banarsi Lal ACoA Commissioner, (Term ended September 2014) Alaska Pioneer Home Advisory Board Chair, Fairbanks The baby boomers need to remain vigilant and actively engaged at all levels where current and future needs for senior services are discussed and planned for. Such an engagement may include a dialogue with Advocacy groups, the Administration, and the Legislature, and may ensure that the response is proportionate to the need for successful aging in Alaska. Goal 1 Goal 2 Goal 3 8 Alaska Commission on Aging Eleanor Dementi ACoA Commissioner, Public Member, Cantwell Seniors should attend community activities that interest them thereby making their presence known and influence the community.Ensure safety and quality of care in residential settings. \u0097 Strengthen the role of the primary care setting as a point of \u0097 entry to the dementia care system. Develop a long-term care workforce trained in dementia care. Increase the level of knowledge of dementia care and \u0097 caregiver competence within the long-term services and supports workforce. Ensure health, human service and public safety professionals \u0097 are knowledgeable about dementia. Increase cultural competence among dementia care workers. \u0097 Improve quality of life for family and other informal caregivers. Maintain and improve the physical and mental health of \u0097 family and other informal caregivers. Develop a coalition of families and agency representatives \u0097 to advocate for policy changes to support family and other informal caregivers and to decrease the financial burden of caregiving. Increase monitoring and research into ADRD prevalence, cost of care, prevention and treatment. Maintain and expand research to understand ADRD \u0097 prevalence, utilization and cost of care in Alaska. Maintain and expand research of ADRD best practices related \u0097 to risk reduction, treatment and care. Goal 4 Goal 5 Goal 6Annual Report Fiscal Year 2014 9Accomplishments The Alaska Commission on Aging carried out the following activities in FY2014 pursuant to our core service areas of planning services for seniors, educating the public about issues affecting seniors, and advocating for policies, programs and services that help older Alaskans maintain a high quality of life and ability to participate meaningfully in their communities. The Commission collaborates with public and private partners to work toward a common goal of healthy and successful aging for all Alaska seniors. PLANNING Alaska's Roadmap to Address Alzheimer's Disease and \u0097 Related Dementias. The Roadmap, Alaska's first ever state plan dedicated to addressing the multiple and complex needs of Alaskans impacted by dementia, is a guide for prioritizing and implementing strategies that will improve the quality of life for Alaskans with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and their caregivers. While advanced age is a significant risk factor, Alzheimer's disease is not a normal part of aging. Research also points to other risk factors for dementia that are on the rise including poor cardiovascular health, chronic disease, mental health problems, hearing loss, and head injuries. The Roadmap's recommendations are based on findings from ACoA's seven statewide family caregiver forums, a family caregiver survey, and first-time data from the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey describing perceived cognitive impairment in Alaska. Alaska's Roadmap to Address Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias is scheduled for completion in December 2014. Development of the Alaska State Plan for Senior \u0097 Services, FY2016-2019. This Plan is required by all states which receive federal funding from the Older Americans Act to support senior services that include senior grant- funded services, elder protection, senior vocational training, legal assistance, the Senior Voice, and other vital programs. The current State Plan for Senior Services expires on June 30, 2015. The Commission prepares the State Plan in collaboration with Senior and Disabilities Services and other partners including representatives from state agencies, Anna Frank ACoA Commissioner, Public Member, Fairbanks We need to be active in different programs and be a voice and an advocate for our Elders. 10 Alaska Commission on Aging senior providers, and consumers. These representatives comprise the State Plan Advisory Committee which provides guidance and oversight of the Plan's development. The Department of Health and Social Services submits the Plan to the Administration on Community Living to satisfy the federal requirement for Alaska to receive federal funding for senior programs. Planning activities are currently underway to inform the development of the Plan's core sections that include a set of goals, strategies and performance measures; an intrastate funding formula; and supplemental information that provides data on a range of topics including demographic, health status, utilization of senior services, financial security, and senior housing. The FY2016-FY2019 Plan will be completed by June 2015. Elder-Senior Listening Sessions & Senior Survey. \u0097 The Commission uses several sources to gather quantitative and qualitative information to develop the needs assessment for the State Plan for Senior Services. For the FY2016-2019 Plan, we developed and are in the process of implementing a senior survey, a senior services provider survey, and hosting six Elder-Senior Listening Sessions to gather input first-hand from seniors and their caregivers about the needs of older Alaskans. Elder-Senior Listening Sessions have been held in Glennellen, September 2013; Juneau, February 2014; two sessions in Fairbanks, September 2014 that included a special outreach to Alaska Native Elders; Homer, October 2014; and Anchorage, December 2014. The Commission also received more than 2,000 completed senior surveys from Alaskans age 55 years and older and had strong community participation at each of the Elder-Senior Listening Sessions. Through these sources, the Commission sought input from seniors and their caregivers about senior access to primary health care, satisfaction with local home and community-based services, availability of senior housing in local communities, caregiver support, economic security, unmet needs of seniors in their regions, and other relevant information. Based on preliminary findings from these information sources, the priority areas of concern identified by Alaskan seniors and their caregivers listed in order of priority are access to health care (that includes long-term support services), economic security, and the need for appropriate and affordable senior housing. Rachel Greenberg ACoA Commissioner, Senior Service Provider, Palmer Baby Boomers can use their power by using their network, resources and influence to ensure communities are safe, accessible and have programs and services available to help them lead independent, healthy, successful lives as they age. Baby boomers have the opportunity to pave the way and change the mind-set of the general population about what we think of aging in Alaska. Becoming a \"Senior\" is a GREAT achievement!Annual Report Fiscal Year 2014 11White House Conference on Aging 2015. \u0097 The White House Conference on Aging (WHCoA) occurs every ten years with the purpose of gathering policy recommendations from all states on important issues facing older Americans. The last WHCoA occurred in 2005. Four themes provide the focus for the WHCoA that coincide with the focus areas for Alaska's State Plan for Senior Services planning efforts. The WHCoA four focus areas include financial security, long-term support services, healthy aging, and elder protection. ACoA will utilize information from the State Plan's needs assessment activities to develop policy recommendations for the WHCoA. \"Senior housing,\" an issue important to Alaska seniors according to the findings from the State Plan needs assessment activities, will be added to Alaska's WHCoA policy recommendations. The WHCoA 2015 will take place during the 50th anniversary of Medicare, Medicaid, and the Older Americans Act, in addition to the 80th anniversary for Social Security. ADVOCACY During the FY2014 legislative session, the ACoA monitored a total of 41 bills and resolutions and actively supported eight pieces of legislation with committee testimony and letters of support to bill sponsors, legislative committees, and Congressional members. During ACoA's February 2014 legislative advocacy meeting in Juneau, Commission members met with 41 legislators and their staff members to discuss senior issues and offer recommendations for budget and policy items to address senior needs based on data and public input gathered during the Commission's Elder-Senior Listening Sessions, Family Caregiver Forums, and public comment at ACoA's quarterly meetings. Denise Daniello ACoA Executive Director, Juneau The aging of Alaska presents both challenges and opportunities as the senior population increases and baby boomers come of age. Viewing older adults as a great resource, an asset, rather than as a liability is an important step for creating meaningful opportunities that actively engage Alaska seniors and baby boomers to use their talents and improve community life - so that we may all benefit from their life experience dividend.41 Billls & Resolutions 8 Pieces of Legislation 12 Alaska Commission on Aging Rolf Numme ACoA Vice Chair, Public Member, Wasilla Our conceptions about how we age and what aging looks like are changing. Alaska 's seniors are remaining in or re-entering the workforce for financial reasons or personal fulfillment and represent a broader trend among the world's developed nations\u2014that of adults retiring later, living longer, and remaining healthier. Enlightened policies addressing age- related discrimination and the promotion of lifelong learning will serve to enhance our seniors' contributions to their communities.Operating Budget: \u0097 The ACoA and our partners advocated successfully for the following budget items. We thank Governor Parnell and the Legislature for their support of these recommendations: Nutrition, Transportation and Support Services Senior Grant: \u0097 Successfully advocated in support of $545,000 additional base funding to increase the number of seniors (age 60+) provided with home-delivered meals and congregate meals served at senior centers and other group settings; assisted transportation; and homemaker services. This program serves all older Alaskans (age 60+) and targets those most in need who do not qualify for Medicaid waiver services. The increased base funding was requested to provide an appropriate level of services that keep pace with a growing senior population. Vulnerable Alaskans with Challenging Behaviors: \u0097 In collaboration with advocacy partners, ACoA supported this joint advocacy priority to secure base funding in the amount of $525,000 for the Complex Behavior Collaborative to continue training and consultation services for community providers and caregivers who serve vulnerable Alaskans with difficult to manage behaviors - such as persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia and mental illness. Capital Budget. \u0097 ACoA advocated successfully for the following capital budget items in coordination with our advocacy partners:Senior Housing \u0097 in the amount of $4.5 million for the Senior Citizen Housing Development Grant Fund administered by the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation to provide gap funding for the construction of senior housing projects and weatherization/ rehabilitation programs for seniors and disabled residences. Community Transportation \u0097 services, administered by the Department of Transportation, in the amount of $1.05 million to provide transportation for seniors and persons with disabilities. Deferred Maintenance and Accessibility Improvements \u0097 Program , administered by the Department of Health and Social Services, in the amount of $2 million to fund structural renovations (such as roof repairs, accessible doors, fire safety) that improve or maintain the safety, security, and accessibility of premises for facilities of providers that serve Trust beneficiaries, including older Alaskans with dementia.Annual Report Fiscal Year 2014 13Alaska Heating Assistance Program \u0097 , administered by the Department of Health and Social Services, Division of Public Assistance. ACoA advocated to maintain funding for this program with no reductions to ensure heating assistance for Alaskans qualifying for this assistance, especially seniors who live on a fixed income so that they may afford to comfortably heat their homes and not resort to cost-cutting measures that could jeopardize senior health and safety. In FY2013, this program served 13,678 income-eligible households of which 4,179 (31%) had an elderly member. Legislation. \u0097 The ACoA and our partners advocated successfully for passage of the following legislation: Sunset extension for the Alaska Senior Benefits Payment Program: The Senior Benefits program provides a critical safety net for seniors with greatest financial need by the provision of tiered monthly payment amounts of $75, $125, and $250 for seniors (age 65+) with incomes up to 175% federal poverty level. This program helps seniors pay for food, energy costs, housing, and medication. In FY2013, the program served 10,954 seniors with an average recipient age of 75 years old. Establish a Statewide Immunization Program: Using a cost-effective public-private partnership model, SB 169 establishes a self-sustaining statewide immunization program to provide vaccines for Alaskans of all ages and creates a permanent solution to fill the fiscal gap of reduced federal funding for Alaska's immunization program. Former legislation sponsored by Senator Giessel (and supported by ACoA) used state funding to fund the program as a temporary measure that will expire on July 1, 2015. ACoA advocated for SB 169 to increase senior access to vaccines such as pneumonia, influenza, and shingles for seniors who are low income, not eligible for Medicare, and those who receive services by providers who do not accept Medicare. Paula Pawlowski ACoA Commissioner, Director \"Serve Alaska\" Commerce, Community & Economic Development, Anchorage Seniors are a powerful force in Alaska, they work, they volunteer, they contribute, they vote and they want to stay in Alaska with their families.HB 263 Representative Hawker SB 169 Senator Giessel 14 Alaska Commission on Aging Air Ambulance Services: This legislation allows for the continuation of affordable membership programs to insure Alaskans who require air ambulance services. This service is particularly important for critically ill and injured patients residing in rural and remote areas who require emergency transport to hospitals when levels of care are not locally available. The cost of Medevac services is expensive and often exceeds $100,000. The Commission advocated in support of this legislation to protect older Alaskans and other patients living in rural communities with limited incomes from financial hardship resulting from paying for the total cost of these services out-of-pocket. Autopsies & Death: HB 301 amends current law that requires deaths occurring outside of a medical facility to be reported to the Medical Examiner's Office located in Anchorage to establish the cause of death and issue a death certificate. This process can be stressful, complicated, and costly for a rural family, especially those with elderly loved ones who pass away at home. HB 301 allows death certificates to be issued in the region and allows Tribal officials to declare death and complete the death certificate form in consultation with the Medical Examiner's Office. Extend Alaska Health Care Commission (AHCC): SB 135 provides for a 3-year extension of the Alaska Health Care Commission. The purpose of this Commission is to increase understanding and knowledge about Alaska's health care system and make policy recommendations to improve quality, affordability, and access to health care. ACoA supported the extension to continue the work of the Alaska Health Care Commission to promote strategies that will improve access to primary health care and long- term support services for Alaska seniors.David Blacketer ACoA Commissioner, Public Member, Kodiak People must prepare oneself for older age by starting early.

It makes you stronger and helps you feel better. Exercises that improve balance and coordination (like Tai Chi) are most helpful. Lack of exercise leads to weakness and increases your chances of falling.Ask your doctor or health provider about the best type of exercise program for you. Have your health care provider review your medicines.Have your doctor or pharmacist review all the medicines you take, even over-the-counter medicines. As you get older, the way medicines work in your body can change. Some medicines, or combinations of medicines, can make you sleepy or dizzy and can cause you to fall. Drink alcohol in moderation, if at all. Drinking increases your chances of a fall. Have your vision checked.Have your eyes checked by an eye doctor at least once a year. You may be wearing the wrong glasses or have a condition like glaucoma or cataracts that limits your vision. Poor vision can increase your chances of falling.

Healthy Alaskans 2020: \u0097 The Commission continued participation in this project of the Division of Public Health and the Alaska Native Health Tribal Consortium by providing data and other resources for senior health needs. Alaska Mental Health Trust Authority (AMHTA): \u0097 As a statutory advisory board partner, the Commission provides budget and policy recommendations to the AMHTA regarding matters affecting Senior Trust beneficiaries including older persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias and other behavioral health conditions. The Commission provides information to the Trust that examines service utilization and gaps in service regarding long-term support services for Senior Trust beneficiaries across the continuum of care. As a result, the Trust expanded its Housing Focus Area to include an emphasis on long-term support services. Commission members and staff also serve as representatives for Trust focus area workgroups and committees including the Housing and Long-Term Support Focus Area, Workforce Development, Disability Justice, and the Trustee Applicant Review Committee. Aging and Disabilities Resource Centers (ADRCs): \u0097 The Commission provides support to Senior and Disabilities Services for the ongoing development of the ADRCs as the single point of entry for the State's long-term support services serving seniors and disabled persons and advocated for continued funding. ACoA's executive director serves as a member of the ADRC Advisory Council. 24 Alaska Commission on AgingCollaboration with Local Senior Advisory \u0097 Commissions: The Commission coordinates with the Fairbanks North Star Borough Senior Advisory Commission, the Anchorage Senior Advisory Commission, and the Juneau Commission on Aging regarding advocacy for statewide issues affecting Alaska seniors. Local senior commissions work with their local governing bodies to pass resolutions in support of legislative priorities that benefit older Alaskans statewide. These resolutions are then forwarded to the Legislature. Memberships on Other Boards and Commissions: \u0097 The Pioneer Home Advisory Board and the Alaska Commission on Aging work closely together on senior issues as seats are reserved for each Chair on both boards. Commissioner Banarsi Lal, Chair of the Pioneer Home Advisory Board, and Mary Shields, ACoA's Chair, serve on both boards. In addition, Commissioner Lal serves on the board of the Governor's Council on Disabilities and Special Education and as Chair of the Fairbanks North Star Borough Senior Advisory Commission. Denise Daniello, ACoA's executive director serves on the board for the Alaska Brain Injury Network, a nonprofit organization promoting education, prevention, and advocacy for a service system to address the needs of brain injury survivors and their caregivers. A reminder from ACoA Chair Mary Shields: Speak up! Talk to your legislative representatives and assembly members. Keep them informed as to what is going on with the older adults in their towns. Annual Report Fiscal Year 2014 25On the Horizon: Challenges & Opportunities for Successful Aging in Alaska Alaska seniors continue to be the fastest growing demographic in the nation as well as in Alaska. Seniors who are age 60 years and older total more than 1 16,900 Alaskans and comprise fifteen percent of the state's total population. Alaskans age 85 and older are the fastest growing age segment of the senior population that increased more than six-fold comparing 1980 (n=619) to 2013 (n=4,697). Alaska's senior demographic surge is attributed to the aging of the large baby boomer population, longer life expectancy due to medical advances and healthier lifestyles, and shifting migration patterns. In recent years, an increasing number of Alaskans have reached their senior years, and a greater number of them are choosing to remain in Alaska. Alaska is becoming a preferred state for older people to live due to a more moderate climate and recreational opportunities in addition to a favorable economic environment including comparatively lower taxes, enhanced job prospects, senior-friendly businesses, and better-funded services for seniors according to a report published by the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce (Fall 2014). This is good news for Alaska seniors as they will live longer and more productive lives surrounded by their families and friends and for the State as seniors contribute significantly to the wealth and prosperity in the communities where they live. Overall, seniors have a dramatic cash impact on the State's economy. Annually, senior retirement income contributes approximately $2.4 billion to the State's economy from retirement earnings and savings. Seniors spend their retirement income locally and year-round on a broad range of goods and services that has an economic multiplier effect resulting in job creation and income generation that expands the economy. The retirement industry creates approximately 13,000 jobs in health care, long-term care, housing, and other employment sectors. More Alaska seniors are in the labor force than are seniors nationally, and they are engaged in a wide variety of work including healthcare, education, public administration, and retail. Currently, 22% of Alaska seniors are still working in ACoA Chair Mary Shields on affordable housing in Alaska: Affordable housing and all that goes with it - electricity, heat, taxes, etc. This applies to all areas of Alaska. 26 Alaska Commission on Agingcomparison to 16% of seniors nationwide. Alaska seniors in the labor force contribute an additional $633 million for a total senior economic impact of $3 billion annually. The retirement industry compares favorably with other industries in the state including commercial fishing ($2.2 billion), construction ($2.1 billion), retail trade ($2.1 billion) and tourism ($1.9 billion). Moreover, seniors also enhance the economy through volunteer activities and through caring for family members and friends. Retirees comprise about 24% of all volunteers in Alaska. They contribute an estimated 86 hours per person annually (or 4 million hours in total) that is equivalent to $90 million (estimated at $22 per volunteer hour of services rendered). Alaska ranks #12 in the nation with having the highest senior volunteer activity. As more seniors live to an advanced age, access to appropriate health care and long-term support services becomes of greater importance that will increase demand on resources to pay for them. The need for these services has been identified as a primary challenge by seniors participating in the Elder-Senior Listening Sessions and responding to the 2014 Senior Survey. Many seniors still experience challenges in finding primary care providers that accept Medicare reimbursement. Others struggle with depression and addictions, particularly boomers who are at high risk for substance and alcohol abuse that is projected to increase as they age. Incorporating behavioral health care services in the primary care setting using a multi-disciplinary health care team approach through the Patient Centered Medical Home model provides a central place for older adults to receive appropriate care that has demonstrated positive outcomes for older patients. Family caregiving is the essential bedrock for long-term care for seniors and a rapidly growing component of our health care system. In Alaska, an estimated 128,000 family caregivers provide unpaid care valued at $1.1 billion. While the need for long-term care will increase substantially as baby boomers reach their 80s, the pool of family caregivers is expected to drop dramatically from the current 7 potential family caregivers for every person age 80 years and older to 4 family caregivers per senior by 2030 due to the increasing number of older people and smaller family size. Caregiving often exerts a heavy emotional, physical and financial toll that puts family caregivers at risk. Moreover, caregiving has dramatically expanded in As an older Alaskan, I learned that you don 't need to retire because of age. \u2014Anchorage resident, Age 85Annual Report Fiscal Year 2014 27recent years and now includes a broad array of nursing tasks such as giving injections, wound care, preparing special diets, and managing medications. The majority of family caregivers receive little or no training to perform these complex tasks. Without family caregivers, the cost of long-term supports would increase astronomically. In FY2015, the Commission will advocate for policies that provide family caregivers with more meaningful supports and training as Alaska's population ages. Lack of appropriate and affordable senior housing is another primary challenge that continues to be identified by Alaska seniors according to surveys and community forums conducted by ACoA over the last ten years. Alaska has a statewide shortage of accessible, affordable housing options for seniors. In some regions of the state, there is inadequate availability of senior assisted living homes, particularly those that offer memory care. In other areas, affordable housing is the major obstacle. Alaska continues to have the highest median annual costs for nursing home care at $237 ,250 and $66,000 for assisted living compared to $77 ,380 and $42,000 respectively for the country (Genworth Cost of Care Survey 2014). While many seniors prefer to age in place in their own home for as long as possible, demand is growing for senior housing that provides supportive services on site. Continuing care retirement communities, a residential model that combines residential care options providing a continuum of care for residents so that they may age in place as their needs change, is an innovative housing model growing in popularity nationwide. Access to accessible housing based on universal-designed principles and a host of supportive services including home- and community-based services, tele-health care, and assistive technology are instrumental to keeping seniors healthy, independent, and able to live in their own homes. Innovative funding strategies that include a mix of grant funds, loan financing, tax credits and public-private partnerships are required to build Alaska's senior housing stock across the continuum of care. Providing appropriate and affordable senior housing is an important strategy for sustaining a healthy community, promoting intergenerational relations, and allowing older Alaskans to maintain a high quality of life in communities of their choice. Keep working past 65 years - be involved in community affairs! \u2014Anchorage resident, Age 85 28 Alaska Commission on AgingAlaska Commission on Aging (ACoA) Senior Snapshot: Older Alaskans in 2014 Annually, the ACoA gathers data to provide a sketch of the health and well-being of Alaskan residents, age 60 years and older. Below are observations on the information for the 2013/2014 Senior Snapshot. Alaska continues to be the fastest growing senior population per capita for the 5th year \u0097 in a row. The seven states with the fastest-growing senior populations 65+ in 2013 were Alaska (58.9%), Nevada (49.3%), Colorado (41.7%), Georgia (40.1%), Arizona (39.6%), Idaho (39.1%), and South Carolina (39.1%). The number of Alaskan seniors age 60+ continues to increase. From the 2000 census \u0097 to the 2014 projected population data, the Alaskan senior population increased 1 17 .4% statewide. The highest regional growth rate over this period was in the Aleutians (176.3%) followed by Southcentral (163.3%). Southeast Alaska has the highest concentration of seniors at 19.8% where almost one in 5 residents in the region is an adult age 60 years and older. The number of Alaskans age 60 to 64 has grown to 44,200 in 2014 from 17 ,327 in 2000, a \u0097 155.1% increase. The 85-and-older Alaskan cohort increased at a fast pace. These seniors are generally \u0097 frail, at risk for developing Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), and are the most likely to depend on home- and community-based and long-term support services. The 85-and-older cohort doubled from 2,634 in 2000 to 5,860 in 2014, for an increase of 112 . 5% . Retired seniors as a whole contribute at least $2.4 billion annually to Alaska's economy \u0097 which includes their retirement income, health care spending and revenue from other sources. The retirement industry is one of the state's top economic sectors. The number of Alaskans age 65 and older receiving monthly cash supplemental \u0097 payments from the Senior Benefits Program continues to increase. To qualify for this program, seniors must be 65 or older and have incomes below the 175% of the federal poverty level for Alaska. The number of seniors receiving food stamps continues to grow at a high rate from 2013 \u0097 to 2014 the amount has grown by 4.3% although it has not kept up the with increase in seniors. The amount of food stamps provided to each senior is based on the need and income of the entire household.Annual Report Fiscal Year 2014 29Senior Snapshot: Older Alaskans in 2014 The number of seniors (age 65+) receiving monthly cash supplemental payments from the \u0097 Old Age Assistance program (Adult Public Assistance) has decreased this past year by 34 seniors for a total of 5,546 individuals receiving $239.02 month. There were 475 applicants on the Pioneer Home active waitlist in 2012. To be eligible for \u0097 the Pioneer Homes one must be 65 years or older, be a resident for at least one year and complete an application. To qualify for the active wait list, the senior must be willing and ready to move into a Pioneer Home within 30 days of an offer. Alaska continues to have the highest nursing home costs in the country at $660 per day or \u0097 $240,900 per year in 2014. The average annual cost in the United States is $87 .600.Alaska has the highest cost for assisted living home care at $66,000 per year as compared \u0097 to the national average of $42,000 per year. The 2013 average daily rate for adult day services in Alaska dropped from $1 13 to $103 daily \u0097 rate in 2014. The national average is $65 per day. The number of cases opened in the Office of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman (consisting \u0097 of mostly elderly people living in long-term care facilities) continues to increase each year to a total of 734. The number of new cases increased 97% since 201 1. Alaska has 17 skilled nursing facilities and 636 licensed assisted living homes. The top complaints against facilities were accidents/injuries/falls/improper handling. The number of intakes of reports of harm by the Department of Health and Social Services, \u0097 Adult Protective Services of adults 60 and older is the highest since the program was created. In FY2014, there were 3,085 cases, an increase of 18.7% over the past year. Falls continue to be the number one cause of non-fatal hospitalized injuries for Alaskans \u0097 age 65 and older and the primary cause of fatal injury for Alaskans age 75 years and older. The Alaska Trauma Registry reported 3,356 cases of fall-related injury hospitalizations among Alaskans age 65 and older, representing a 24% increase hospitalizations compared to the preceding 5-year time period.

The senior grant programs are available to individuals age 60 and older. Seniors (age 60+) need not be Medicaid-eligible in order to receive grant services. Over the past three years, this number has also included seniors served by ADRCs. 22. Information from the Medicare Information Office. 23. The Long Term Care Ombudsman believes that the rise in complaints is related to the Department of Health and Social Services diligent efforts to get assisted living homes to submit critical incident reports (CIR) when residents are missing, injured, or deceased. The CIRs can lead to additional cases being opened when there is a concern that the homes did not provide adequate supervision and care. So the rise in complaints reflects the additional safeguards DHSS has put in place to ensure resident safety. 24.
