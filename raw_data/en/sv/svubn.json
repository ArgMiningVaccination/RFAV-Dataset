The possibilities and capabilities of essential oils are endless, as there are many different types to choose from which will help and aid in distinctive ways. Essential oils are fundamental in aromatherapy, herbalism and alternative medicine. Essential Oils are concentrated liquefied extracts containing the volatile aromatic compounds from plants, flowers and trees. They have been used for thousands of years for both ceremonial and medicinal applications going back to Ancient Egypt, China and India. Pure Essential Oils contain numerous complex components that often cannot be replicated in a lab, which makes them powerful tools for healing and well-being. There are plenty of different essential oils to choose from, but we've compiled a list of 10 essential oils which we feel are most helpful, accessible and varied in their uses. Please find our complete collection of essential oils [here](/collections/pure-essential-oil-single-notes). There are many, many ways to use essential oils. Outside of perfumery, essential oils can be used topically when combined with carrier oils or lotions, diffused throughout your living spaces, used with cold and hot compresses for medicinal purposes, in baths, through steam inhalation and some neat application directly to the skin. Helichrysum is a member of the daisy and sunflower family and is among the most miraculous and powerful healing plants on our planet. Helichrysum italicum essential oil, also known as Immortelle, is revered for its unparalleled, regenerative and protective benefits in skin care as well as its anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. In aromatherapy, Helichrysum essential oil instills deep peace and tranquility and provides support in releasing emotional trauma. It is also a useful tool to help us reconnect with the spiritual realm and opens the heart and mind to new experiences and practices. The name Helichrysum is derived from the Greek words helios meaning sun, and chrysos meaning gold, which refer to its numerous clusters of tiny yellow flowers. These dried flowers were presented as an offering to the Gods in Ancient Greece, used in Medieval Europe as potpourri and have flavored sauces in various cultures around the Mediterranean. While the origins of the name Immortelle are not well documented, it derives from the word immortal and most likely refers to the long life of the cut flowers and the powerful anti-aging properties of the essential oil and extracts derived from these sacred yellow blossoms. When it comes to essential oils for skincare, nothing beats the effectiveness of Helichrysum. It contains antimicrobial, antibiotic and regenerative compounds that promote healthy skin cell growth and regeneration. It also helps speed up healing of wounds, burns, and rashes and reduces scarring. Lavender essential oil is probably the most well-known of all essential oils, and the plant's sweet, herbaceous floral aroma has been used for its nurturing and cleansing properties for thousands of years. Lavender essential oil is aptly referred to as the \"mother of essential oils\" by aromatherapist Valerie Ann Wormwood, for its compassionate nature and the ability of Lavender to \"let us know that we are all her precious children and we all have our destiny of goodness to fulfill.\" Pure Lavender essential oil also possesses a myriad of therapeutic and medicinal properties that have furthered its popularity and make it a staple in any essential oil kit. Its antiseptic, anti-inflammatory and calming properties help with headaches, bug bites, cuts, skin irritations or anytime we need a little extra support during times of stress or anxiety. While we recommend diluting essential oils in a carrier for use on the body, Lavender is quite gentle and is typically safe to apply neat (undiluted) when only using a drop or two for a small area or palm inhalation. Lavender essential oil also helps enhance the body's immune response, and its nurturing properties ease a troubled mind during times of illness. Lavender instills feelings of calm and peacefulness and can help \"blow away the blues and cleanse the emotional palette,\" as Kate has said. It has that gentle, nurturing energy that brings forth inner peace and supports us during times of stress and turmoil. Lavender can also promote spiritual healing, clear blockages of energy in the body and is a beneficial oil to diffuse during meditation to help calm and center the mind. Its ability to bring forth compassion and uplift us in times of sadness are remarkable. Frankincense Essential Oil (Boswellia carterii) is one of the most powerful and deeply spiritual essential oils available. Frankincense has a long history of use in a multitude of religious and spiritual practices going back thousands of years - so much so, that it has ingrained itself into the root of human consciousness. The profound connection felt when we inhale its warm, grounding aroma is the reason that it resonates with most everyone. Frankincense, or Olibanum as it is also called, comes from the resin of the Frankincense tree that grows in North Africa and Arabia. It was one of the most prized commodities in early commerce, finding universal appreciation as it was traded throughout the ancient world on the \"Incense Road.\" The resin itself has been burnt for many thousands of years for its ability to purify, protect and connect us to the divine. Following this tradition, we can still burn Frankincense resin today with incense charcoal for a transformative, aromatic experience that fills any space with purifying smoke. Frankincense resin has been depicted in Egyptian temples, mentioned in Hebrew texts and the three Magi presented it as a precious gift to baby Jesus. Medicinally, we are only now starting to fully realize Frankincense's full range of benefits for healing both the mind and body. Adding a couple of drops of the essential oil to your skincare regimen promotes healing and skin cell regeneration, especially in those exposed to environmental stress. Additionally, many studies have demonstrated its ability to help treat depression and anxiety, lowering cortisol levels and producing calmative effects on the psyche. Its anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant properties benefit the respiratory system - easing coughs and supporting deep breathing for relief from symptoms of bronchitis and asthma. One could write an entire book on the amazing history and spectrum of benefits derived from the unassuming Frankincense tree. It encourages the incredible feeling of interconnection between all people and is able to enlighten us to the powerful correlation between ritual, spirituality and aroma. Deeply sacred and divinely powerful, Frankincense essential oil calms the mind, uplifts the spirit and provides healing for all inhabitants of this earth.

It also has a rich history of use in a variety of spiritual practices and ceremonies, particularly weddings and funerals as a symbol of remembrance. The ancient Egyptians would honor their loved ones by leaving sprigs of the herb on coffins or tombs.

The name Bergamot is derived from the Italian city of Bergamo, where the oil was first sold. Most of the production of Bergamot essential oil takes place in Southern Italy, where it is expeller-pressed from the peel of the citrus fruit after the pulp has been removed. Until the mid-19th century, this process was done by hand and quite intensive as it takes 200kg of fruit to produce one liter of essential oil. While the fruit itself is not edible, the dried peel and/or essential oil give Earl Grey tea its unique flavor and are also used as an ingredient in Turkish delight. In perfumery, Bergamot was one of the ingredients in the original Eau de Cologne that was all the rage of many 18th century European courts.
