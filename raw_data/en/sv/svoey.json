This life in the community includes: (a) A physically and emotionally healthy lifestyle (health); (b) A stable, safe and supportive place to live (a home); (c) Meaningful daily activities such as a job, school, volunteerism, family caretaking, or creative endeavors and the independence, income, and resources to participate in society (a purpose); and (d) Relationships and social networks that provide support, friendship, love, and hope (a community). Additional aims of the block grant programs reflect SAMHSA's overall mission and values, specifically: To promote participation by people with mental and substance use disorders in shared decision making and self-direction of thei r services and supports. To ensure access to effective culturally and linguistically appropriate services for underserved populations including Tribes, racial and ethnic minorities, and LGBT. To promote recovery, resiliency and community integration for adults with serious mental illness and children with serious emotional disturbances and their families.

NEVADA SUMMARY Nevada's population identified in the 2020 census is 3,108,462 w hich is an increase of 15% from 2010. Nevada is expected to increase another 1.7% over the next year. The population is made up of approximately equal percentages of females and males. The median household income is $63,276. Nevada's land area is approximately 110,567 square miles. This area would include up to seven northeastern states within Nevada's geographic borders. Nevada's poverty level by county ranges from 12% to 18.9%. In 2019, there were 384,900 Nevadans in poverty (12.7% of the state's population). There were 32,077 rural and fron tier residents in poverty (10.9% of the population). The median home level has increased significantly with Clark County's (Las Vegas) median home price at $324,738 and Washoe County's (Reno) median home price at $406,905. This has increased the level of a nxiety and stressors in the community due to the higher cost of living. Nevada's unemployment rate continues to fluctuate from 29.5% in June 2020 to 7.8% , above the current national unemployment rate of 5.9%. This also impacts access to care issues with ma ny families required to work two jobs or who are out of work with minimal health or behavioral health insurance. In 2018, 12.9% of Nevadans under the age of 65 were uninsured, including 13.0% rural and frontier residents. There were 57,246 uninsured Nevada ns under the age of 19 (8.0%), including 6,002 uninsured rural and frontier children In addition, Nevada is projected to be a minority -majority state by the year 2023, which requires approaches that are culturally and linguistically appropriate to improve access of care to all populations. Nevada has biennial legislative sessions are every two years. This elevates the importance of planning for behavioral health services. During the 2017 legislative session, Nevada established the regional behavioral health policy boards to address behaviora l health in Nevada by geographic catchment areas. This includes a Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator (RBHC) who works directly within the region to support behavioral health needs, gaps, assessments, coordination, and communications. In the 2021 legisl ative session, Nevada worked with the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services for provisions relating to crisis stabilization center and crisis care to ensure that Medicaid was a viable option for continuity of care. Nevada intends to submit an appli cation to CMS for a Mobile Crisis Planning Grant to provide for sustainable funding for the services within the state Medicaid program. Nevada was also able to implement legislation to start the process of developing regulations to support the maintenance of the 988 line (beyond implementation) and to be part of the braided funding for crisis care systems as part of Senate Bill 390. The legislation will result in the development of the Crisis Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 2 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 2 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 38 of 305 2 Response Account with funding derived from a 988 surcharge on all eligible phone lines. Planning for 988 and the entire crisis continuum of care has been primary behavioral health priority for Nevada for the past few years and the impact of COVID has prompted even greater focus on designing and implementing the system of crisis care. The population density of Nevada's counties varies widely , but the state has made it a priority that all citizens are represented by a Regional Behavioral Health Board (RBHB). with 73.6% of Nevada's population , Clark County is the most populous area in the state, with an estimated 2,251,175 persons. Esmeralda County , by comparison, is the least populous county, with less than one percent of Nevada's population, an estimated 969 persons. Yet each of these counties have representation as part of the R BHB . Nevada has seventeen counties with only three being identified as urban. The remaining counties are defined as rural and frontier counties, which further challenges the behavioral health system with the large geographic areas , limited services , and lack of public transportation. The coordinatio n with the R egional Behavioral Health Coordinators provides linkage and support strategizing with other counties on access to care issues and county specific priorities based on population, especially with limited resources. Compounding the struggle for Nevada's population to access services are the shortages that exist within the behavioral health workforce. All 17 counties have significant regions that are identified as Mental Health Shortage Areas (HPSAs) with 16 counties recording HPSA scores greater than 16 by the Nevada Health Workforce Research Center in the Office of Statewide Initiatives at the University of N evada, Reno School of Medicine (2021) . Currently, 3 million Nevadans or 94.5% of the state's population reside in a federally designated mental hea lth professional shortage area, 16 of 17 counties in Nevada are single -county mental HPSAs. Despite the significant barriers to workforce and access outlined above, Nevada's behavioral health plans are evidence -based, data driven, and geographically focu sed. Mental health data are collected by numerous data sources in Nevada, including YRBS, BRFSS, hospital billing, state -funded mental health facilities, and vital records.

Nevada also works with other Divisions to identify services, needs or populations who are underinsured, uninsured or have limited abilities to acc ess behavioral health care. As part of the efforts, Nevada has also been working to improve suicide analytics for attempts and access to care. Nevada has been focused on reducing the number of emergency room visits with plans for stabilization units, Asser tive Community Treatment (ACT) teams, mobile crisis, and a structured crisis support system that is capable of providing tailored services for adults and children, youth, and families . NEVADA'S DIVERSE POPULATIONS The State of Nevada works continuously to address the needs of diverse populations. D uring the 2005 legislative session, the Nevada State Legislature created the Office of Minority Health with passage of Assembly Bill 580. Included in the bill was the creation of an Advisory Committee, composed of nine members reflecting the ethnic and geographical diversity of the state. During the 2 017 legislative session, AB 141 was passed broadening the entities' title to the Nevada Office of Minority Health and Equity (NOMHE) and revising the definition of \"minority\" to include members of the LGBTQ community and people who are disabled. Pursuant t o NRS 232.474, NOMHE provides an organized statewide focus serving to: Identify, assess, and analyze issues related to the health status of minority populations and to communicate this information where needed; Participate in, and lead when appropriate, the development of minority needs assessments; service strategies; and the collection of minority health data; Provide reference and resource information on minority health issues; Engage internal and external entities to support initiatives that address specific minority health needs, including target health care program resources to meet these needs; Monitor programs, policies, and procedures for inclusiveness and responsiveness to minority health needs; and Facilitate the develo pment and implementation of research and scientific investigations to produce minority -specific findings. All DHHS agencies are expected to abide by the National Standards for Culturally and Linguistic Appropriate Services (CLAS) in order to advance and s ustain culturally and linguistically appropriate services. Further, all funded providers are required to comply with the requirements of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, P.L. 93 -112, as amended, and with any rel evant program -specific regulations, and shall not discriminate against any employee or offer for employment because of race; national origin; creed; color; sex; religion; AIDS and AIDS -related conditions). Further, DHHS has established a statewide Special Populations & Health Disparities Quality Improvement Team. The team consists of eight workgroups that study the needs and service gaps of individuals in encompassing the following special populations: Adolescents and young adults Transitional age youth Criminal justice -involved persons Individuals with unstable housing/ dislocated individuals /individuals experiencing homelessness Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 4 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 4 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 40 of 305 4 LGBTQ IAP+ individuals Native American and Hispanic/Latino people Older adults People with co -occurring mental health and substance -related disorders Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD ) Black, Indigenous (and) People of Color (BIPOC ) Veterans, active duty military, and their families In keeping with SAMHSA's guiding principles, DHHS holds that recovery is culturally based and influenced and that services should be culturally grounded, attuned, sensitive, congruent, and personalized to meet each individual's unique needs. To this end, t he agency includes representatives from diverse populations on its various advisory councils; includes racial and minority data sections in all of its needs assessments and gap analysis; and conducts surveys to measure staffs' cultural competence in the ab ility to understand, communicate with, and effectively interact with people across cultures. The state has specific agencies dedicated to serving people who are LGBTQ in both the northern and southern parts of the state. DHHS provides all surveys in Engl ish and Spanish and provides surveys in other languages, as requested. In addition, the Division offers consumer advocates to assist individuals in navigating the system. Many of the consumer advocates are peers with similar diversity and backgrounds to the people they assist. DHHS partners with the 27 American Indian Tribes within the State of Nevada through a Tribal Consultation Process Agreement. This coordination establishes and strengthens ties and relationships with the tribal governments, provides e ducation and outreach, and notifies the tribes of funding opportunities. A network of liaisons represents each division within DHHS. The group meets on a quarterly basis. Tribal mental health and substance -related disorder services are provided by Indian H ealth Services and Medicaid. Division Of Public and Behavioral Health The Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) is part of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) , under the Executive Branch of the State of Nevada. DPBH is comprised of the former Health Division and of the former Division of Mental Health and Developmental Services which merged in 2013 in order to protect, promote and improve the physical and behav ioral health of the people of Nevada. As authorized by Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 433.316 , DPBH serves as the state's Public Health Authority and Mental Health Commissioner . The DHHS director appoints both the Single State Authority (SSA) for substance abuse and the S ingle Mental Health Authority (SMHA) ; currently, the DHHS Senior Advisor on Behavioral Health serves as both the SSA and the SMHA. This executive staff provides oversight and quality assurance to behavioral health providers statewide; designs, plans, funds, and implements systems of care, including behavioral health prevention, early intervention, treatment and recovery support services; establishes funding priorities for behavioral he alth services and supports through close collaboration with communities and stakeholders; evaluates outcomes of behavioral health interventions; and guides policy and financing options across DHHS.

BHPAC has three federal mandates: 1. Review the Mental Health Block Grant Plan and Priorities and make recommendations . 2. Serve as an advocacy group for adults with serious mental Illness, children with severe emotional disturbance , individuals with other mental health conditions or emotional problems; and people with co -occurring substance -related and mental health disorders . 3. Monitor ; review ; and evaluate ; not less than once each year, the allocation and adequacy of behavioral health services within the state. Children's Behavioral Health Consortium : As established in NRS 433B.333 & 433B.335, the statewide Children's Behavioral Health Consortium provides Nevada's children and their families with timely access to an array of behavioral health treatment services delivered through a system of care (SOC) that supports their needs in the least restrictive environ ment . Commission on Behavioral Health (CBH): The a 10 -member legislatively (NRS 433 .314 ) created body and appointed by the Governor. CBH establishes and sets policies to ensure adequate development and administration of services and to provide programmatic and financial oversight of Nevada's public system of integrated care and treatment of adults and children with mental health disorders , intellectual disorders, substa nce-related disorders or co -occurring substance -related and mental health disorders , and developmental disabilities -related conditions. DPBH and the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) administer the service delivery system. CBH also promotes and assures the protection of the rights of all people in the system. Epidemiological Outcomes Workgroup (SEOW) :The SEOW workgroup attempts to use data to create reports and materials that are useful across the State. The SEOW has zero policy making or regulatory authority which allows it to remain neutral. The data for the SEOW comes from members and participants who have access to data sources in the health districts, counties, State government, hospitals and medical professionals, cor oners, prevention agencies, universities, the justice system, law enforcement, and other sectors as needed. Some of the data provided includes coroners' reports, State billing data from hospitals and Medicaid billing claims, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveill ance System (BRFSS), The Youth Risk Behavioral Survey (YRBS), Nevada Report Card from the Department of Education, The United States Census Bureau and more. The SEOW generates the epidemiology report which includes data from multiple sources and allows oth er committee's to use the data to drive decision making for projects and programs they oversee. Multidisciplinary Prevention Advisory Committee (MPAC): MPAC provides ongoing advice and guidance to SAPTA and makes p ractice recommendations as related to substance use prevention . The committee was originally authorized under the State Incentive Grant in 2002 and was re - authorized under the Strategic Prevention Framework -Partnerships for Success Grant (SPF -SIG) in 2013. MPAC is a freestanding committee that was designed to : Monitor progress toward objectives; Create a comprehensive statewide prevention strategy; Maximize all available alcohol, tobacco , and other drug prevention and resources; Remove state barriers to enhancing the delivery of effective local substance abuse preve ntion services ; Ensure prevention services are culturally relevant and target populations of need; Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 7 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 7 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 43 of 305 7 Develop shared responsibility among state and local governmental u nits; and Promote the prevention and treatment of alcohol and other drug use. Regional Behavioral Health Policy Boards (RBHPB) : The 2017 Nevada Legislature (Assembly Bill 366) initially created four behavioral health regions (BHR) in the state and created a RBHPB for each of those regions. Just recently, the 2019 Nevada Legislature (Assembly Bill 76) added a fifth BHR and reconfigured the regional assignments : Clark - consis ts of only Clark Cou nty (Las Vegas area) ; Northern - consists of five counties: Carson City, Churchill, Douglas, Lyon, and Storey ; Rural - consists of six counties: Elko, Eureka, Humboldt, Lander, Pershing, and White Pine ; Southern - consists of four counties: Esmeralda, Lincoln, Mineral, and Nye ; and Washoe - consists of only Washoe County (Reno area) . Each RBHPB consists of 13 members and advises DPBH on matters pertaining to the behavioral health needs of adults and children in each region. This includes identifying potential problems with proposed policy changes and service delivery, identifying gaps in services, and making recommendations for service enhancements and allocation of funds. Regional Mental Health Consortia are tasked with developing a long -term strategic plan for the provision of mental health services to children in their jurisdiction. The strategic plan is su bmitted to the Director of DHHS. Each even -numbered year, the consortia submit a list of service - priorities in order to implement the long -term strategic plan with an itemized cost to provide the services and to recommend any revisions to the plan. On odd -numbered years, the consortia submit a status report on the long -term strategic plan and on any revisions that were made to the plan. SAPTA Advisory Board (SAB): SAB serves in an advisory capacity to the SAPTA Bureau Chief and to the SSA. SAB ensures the availability and accessibility of treatment and prevention services within the state. SAB consists of 15 members who serve for 2 -year terms; the members are chosen from SAPTA -funded prevention and treatment programs. The chairperson is elected by the membership and serves as the chief executive of the board and provides general superv ision, direction, and control of affairs of the board. The SAB meets at least quarterly, and the chairperson presides at all meetings. OVERVIEW OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM Nevada's health care system has a strong emphasis on coordinated and integrat ed care along with the need to improve services for persons with mental disorders. The block grant provides Nevada the opportunity to focus on the specific needs of our State to provide services for Children with Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) and Ad ults with Serious Mental Illness (SMI) as defined below. Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) pertains to children and youth up to age 18 who have had a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder in the past year that resulted in functional impa irment that substantially interfered with or limited the child's or youth's role or functioning in family, school, or community activities. Conditions that are excluded from the diagnosis of SED are substance abuse or addictive disorders, irreversible deme ntias, as well as intellectual disabilities and other related conditions, unless they co -occur with another SED that meets current diagnostic criteria and that results in functional impairment. Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 8 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 8 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 44 of 305 8 Serious Mental Illness (SMI) concerns individuals, 18 year s of age and older, who currently or at any time in the past year have had a diagnosable mental, behavioral, or emotional disorder that meets the defining criteria specified in the current diagnostic manual of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and that has resulted in serious functional impairment. Serious functional impairment is defined as difficulties that substantially interfere with or limit one or more major life activities, such as achieving or maintaining housing, employment, education, re lationships or safety. Conditions that are excluded from the diagnosis of SMI are substance abuse or addictive disorders, irreversible dementias, as well as intellectual disabilities, unless they co -occur with another SMI that meets current diagnostic cri teria. All program activities are to be provided under the Vision and Guiding Principles established by Nevada's Behavioral Health Community Planning Committee. The vision is that Nevadans, regardless of age or ability will enjoy a meaningful life led with dignity and self -determination. The DHHS Strategic Framework has adopted the following guiding principles : Independence: People should have options and the ability to select how they live. Access: People's needs are identified and met quickly. Dignity: People are viewed and respected as human beings. Integration: People can live, work, and play as part of t heir community. Quality: Services and supports achieve desired outcomes. Sustainability : Services and supports can be delivered over the long term so individuals can be self - sufficient. The MHBG provides mental health service agencies througho ut Nevada with a degree of flexibility to design and implement mental health related services and activities to address the complex needs of individuals, families, and communities with SMI and children with SED specific to our population. The purpose of the block grant program is to support these services. In order to ensure that the block grant program continues to support the needed and necessary services for the identified target population(s), SAMHSA has indicated that Nevada may use block grants: 1) To fund priority treatment and support services for individuals without insurance, underinsured or for whom coverage is terminated for short periods of time; 2) To fund those priority treatment and support services not covered by Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicaid, Medicare, or private insurance for low-income individuals and that demonstrate success in improving outcomes and/or supporting recove ry; and 3) To collect performance and outcome data for mental health and substance use, determine the ongoing effectiveness of promotion, treatment and supportive services and to plan the implementation of new services. Targeted populations that Nevada's MHBG program will serve include: Children with SED and their families (Age 0-17) Adults with SMI (Age 18-64) Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 9 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 9 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 45 of 305 9 Older Adults with SMI (65 years or older) Individuals with SMI or SED in the rural and homeless populations Individuals with first episode psychosis or early SMI DPBH and DHHS are strong advocates of prevention, early intervention, treatment and referral in order to have a coordinated system of care. This past year, Nevada was able to implement The Nevada Resilience Project. This project focuses on early intervention, resource and referral for individuals experiencing crisis. Nevada's Resilience Ambassadors provide education, information, counseling, and resource navigation while promoting healthy coping, empowerment, and resilience. Nevada provides bi - lingual access to services; assistance navigating to needed resources; support to reduce stress, build coping skills, and develop a resilience plan. Nevada NAVIGATE Early Treatment Program for First Episode of Psychosis (FEP) This evidence -based intervention evolved from the National Institute of Mental Health RAISE (Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode) research initiative (Heinssen et al., Evidence -based Treatments for First Episode of Psychosis: Components of Coordinated Specialty Care, April 2014), and its efficacy and feasibility have been demonstrated within community mental health settings and for rural and low - density population regions in the United States (Kane et al., Am J Psychiatry, 2016 April 1; 1 73(4): 362 - 372). Coordinated specialty care (CSC) is being provided to Nevada residents by multi -disciplinary teams of mental health professionals whose expertise span biological, psychological and social work domains. Recovery -oriented interventions invol ve clients, CSC Team members and, when appropriate, family members and significant others. This program is manualized and includes four core interventions (April 2020, Revised Versions: https://navigateconsultants.org/manuals/ ): Individual Psychotherapy; Pharmacotherapy & Primary (Medical) Care Coordination; Family Education Program; and Supported Employment & Education. Case Manag ement and Peer Support Services are also provided. Access to Services for Early Serious Mental Illness (ESMI) and First -Episode Psychosis (FEP) in Nevada, 2019 -2021 Beginning in 2019, the State of Nevada adopted the strategic goal of achieving statewide implementation of evidence -based coordinated specialty care for residents who are experiencing early -stage schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, brief psychotic d isorder, and other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder. The current status of access to coordinated specialty care services for this population in Nevada is summarized by State statute -defined behavioral health region (below). 1. Northern Behavioral Health Region: Carson Tahoe Health, Behavioral Health Services, Carson City, Nevada was the first site selected to implement the Nevada NAVIGATE early treatment program of CSC to serve individuals experiencing first -episode psychosis a nd living in Carson City and the counties of Churchill, Douglas, Lyon and Storey. The Carson Tahoe FEP Program opened its doors in February 2019 and is active and ongoing. 2. Clark Behavioral Health Region: University of Nevada, Las Vegas/Mojave Counselin g, Las Vegas, Nevada was the second site selected to implement the Nevada NAVIGATE early treatment program of CSC to serve individuals experiencing first -episode psychosis and living in Clark County and the portion of Nye County that is south of the 38th p arallel of north latitude (NRS 433.314). The UNLV/Mojave Counseling FEP Early Treatment Program opened its doors in February 2020 and is active and ongoing. 3.

The University Health First Episode of Psychosis Program will begin enrolling patients in August 2021. Crisis Services Nevada is moving toward building a Crisis Care Response System that is both supportive of local communities, families, and individuals by fostering resilience, and responsive to the needs of individuals in crisis. The development of a Crisis Care Response System in Nevada is possible and existing infrastructure is in place to support, at least in part, each of the core elements of the Crisis Care Res ponse Model. Crisis Call Center Hub The greatest asset in Nevada for Crisis Call Center Hubs is Crisis Support Services of Nevada (CSSNV). It is available to individuals and professional organizations throughout the entire state. CSSNV provides immediate crisis support via numerous technolog ical platforms and can coordinate referrals to other resources and establish connections to other crisis response services, such as Mobile Crisis Teams or Crisis Stabilization Program. In addition to this statewide service, there are also several local cr isis lines available in certain regions. For example, Vitality Unlimited in the Rural Region has a locally operated crisis line that contracts with CSSNV for after -hours crisis calls. There are several examples of this in different counties, and having the se lines operating at a local level has proven to be beneficial in being able to bring individuals into other services offered by the agencies operating these local crisis lines. Nevada has one of six National Suicide Prevention Lifeline National Call Cent ers and the crisis line is experiencing great success deploying resources when necessary and otherwise deescalating people in crisis. Mobile Crisis Similar to the implementation of different crisis call lines, several regions and counties in Nevada have been resourceful in developing different types of mobile outreach units. Various configurations of mobile crisis teams have already been established throughout the state and include law enforcement deflection and diversion programs. There are several exam ples of units that are connected to hospitals, such as Desert Parkway Behavioral Health in Las Vegas, or law enforcement agencies, such as MOST in Washoe County. These connections between Mobile Crisis Teams and agencies that have the capacity to offer oth er targeted services can be invaluable to an individual experiencing a crisis. These programs are also facilitating diversion from hospitals and meeting patients where they are at in the community. Children's mobile crisis response is currently being expan ded in both northern and southern areas of Nevada through the use of the SAMHSA COVID -19 Emergency Behavioral Health Grant. The close relationship between Mobile Crisis Teams and law enforcement is known to be very effective in de -escalating crisis situati ons and diverting individuals from held in a jail or emergency department. For the Mobile Crisis Teams that are in place in Nevada, many are utilizing assessment tools, prioritizing safety and security, and providing connections to other resources for the individuals they serve. These resources are implemented by licensed mental health professionals that are staffed as part of the Mobile Crisis Teams that are in place. The clinical understanding and training that these professionals bring to these teams ca n be very effective in ensuring the safety and security of everyone involved in responding to a crisis. Crisis Stabilization Programs In more populated areas, there are several options for acute and sub -acute care. In the areas where crisis stabilization programs are easily accessible, there are psychiatric and clinical mental health staff on site to Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 11 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 11 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 47 of 305 11 support individuals beyond a crisis. Staff is also provided with adequate training on suicide prevention, trauma - informed care, and safety and security practi ces for crisis stabilization. These regions also have the infrastructure to support the recommended ratio for the number of beds per 100,000 residents in each area. Community Triage Centers were defined in Nevada Revised Statute in 2005 and provide a diffe rent pathway for accessing mental health services, ensuring stabilization within a community setting without first accessing a hospital. These centers were funded creatively, including resources from both state and local sources. Currently, there are three Triage Centers operating in Nevada (two in Las Vegas, and one in Reno). With the additional funding obtained through the SAMHSA COVID -19 Emergency Behavioral Health Grant, two hospitals are expanding to provide this crisis stabilization as an alternative to an emergency department for individuals in crisis (Desert Parkway Behavioral Healthcare Hospital in Las Vegas, and Reno Behavioral Healthcare Hospital in Reno). (Woodard, 2020) Crisis Stabilization Programs are intended to provide more than just a bed t o individuals, and instead offer a welcoming environment to provide compassionate care that supports an individual both during a crisis and after they return to their community. (Stephanie Woodard, 2020) Essential Principles Across the state, there is re ference to various staff in different programs being trained in practices such as Zero Suicide, evidence -based assessment tools, and suicide prevention. There is also a consistent reference to prioritizing safety and security in crisis response services. I t appears in all five regions that there is significant buy - in for a Crisis Care Response System. This benefits not only those in crisis, but also those providing crisis support services. Several regions also referenced the use of trauma -informed care amon g staff within crisis response agencies such as the crisis call center hubs that are used, the mobile team clinicians, and the staff in crisis stabilization facilities. There are four elements include prioritizing focus on safety and security, implementing suicide care best practices, including screening, planning, and follow -up, utilization of a trauma -informed recovery model, and having peer support in crisis response services. In Nevada, the Office of Suicide Prevention has committed to these essential p rinciples as part of their suicide prevention efforts. Since their inception they have worked to implement evidence -based practices for suicide screenings, such as Signs of Suicide in Nevada schools, training and outreach for professionals in numerous disc iplines across the state, and they have worked to establish partnerships with other agencies to collaborate and coordinate their work to prevent suicide. Additional foundational elements of an improved mental health system are in place with mental health uniformity, insurance coverage expansion resulting from the Affordable Care Act, the launch of the Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers, the Excel lence in Mental Health Act, and the implementation of First Episode Psychosis programs throughout the state. The state has also moved to implement OpenBeds technology to support these efforts. Further funding is coming in from the Crisis Counseling Assista nce and Training Grant offered by the Federal Management Agency (FEMA) and SAMHSA. These funds are intended to bring a total of 31 crisis counselors to Nevada across all regions to support individuals seeking assistance related to COVID -19. Clinical Services Nevada's adult mental health clinical services are organized into three regions: Northern, Southern, and Rural. Four agencies deliver mental health services throughout these regions: Lake's Crossing Center (LCC), Stein Forensic Hospital (Stein), Northern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services (NNAMHS), Southern Nevada Adult Mental Health Services (SNAMHS), and Rural Clinics (RC). Northern Region LCC provides comprehensive forensic mental health services. This agency provide s evaluation and/or treatment for court -ordered individuals to restore them to legal competency. This facilit y also provide s Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 12 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 12 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 48 of 305 12 outpatient evaluations of legal competency, risk assessments, and recommendations for treatment for individuals living in the northe rn rural counties and Washoe County . LCC is Nevada's only maximum - security facility . As such, the agency serves people from throughout the state. NNAMHS is a comprehensive, community -based behavioral health agency for adults; the agency is fully accredit ed by The Joint Commission and is certified by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Services are provided on a sliding fee scale, and the agency accepts private insurance; Medicaid; and Medicare. Southern Region Stein provides comprehensive forensic mental health services. This agency provide s evaluation and/or treatment for court -ordered individuals to restore them to legal competency. This facilit y also provide s outpatient evaluations of legal competency, risk assessm ents, and recommendations for treatment for individuals living in the Southern and Clark Counties. Stein is a medium -secure facility. SNAMHS provides mental health services for adults living in Clark County and for adults, children, and adolescents living in rural counties (Nye and Lincoln) that may be closer geographically to this agency than to a rural mental health center. The agency also provides services for the adult forensic population. The main campus is co -located with the state hospital for children and adolescents and with the southern facility for individuals who have intellectual disabilities. SNAMHS has five regional behavio ral health clinics; three are urban and two are rural. SNAMHS is fully accredited by The Joint Commission and is certified by CMS. Rural Region RCs are facilities located in areas not designated as an urban area by the Bureau of the Census, where medica l services are provided by licensed physician assistants or by advanced practice registered nurses who are under the supervision of licensed physicians (NRS 449.0175). RCs provide a full array of outpatient behavioral health services for adults and childre n in 16 clinics in 12 counties situated in the rural and frontier areas of the state between Clark and Washoe counties. These centers provide comprehensive services to severely emotionally disturbed (SED) children and adolescents, as well as adults with se rious mental illness, and most of the RCs provide crisis service during business hours. In the more remote areas of the state (Hawthorne, Lovelock, Tonopah, and Panaca) where therapists are not frequently available on site, medical staffs of Board -Certif ied Psychiatrists and Advanced Practice Nurses provide a variety of health care services through the use of telehealth, which is audiovisual communication technology . Medical staff from different offices also use telehealth for \"hard -to-treat\" cases. RCs also co-locate the Community Health Nursing (CHN) program in 14 rural and frontier communities. The CHN program provides public health nursing, preventative health care, early detection of threats to public health, disaster response, and education. Ser vices include adult and child immunizations, well child examinations, chronic disease education, lead testing, family planning, cancer screenings, and the identification and treatment of communicable diseases including sexually transmitted infections, and tuberculosis (TB). RCs provide mental health services to adults and children in all counties with the exception of the two most populated counties in the state, Clark (the greater Las Vegas area) and Washoe (the Reno/Sparks Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 13 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 13 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 49 of 305 13 area).

OVERVIEW OF THE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM AND SYSTEM ORGANIZATION Children's services are currently provided by the Division of Child and Family Services. They provide services through Children's Mobile Crisis Teams which will continue to be expanded in order to service youth throughout the state. Children/Youth are also seen in psychiatric care units. There is also the availability to expand a psychiatric access line also specific or youth care. Nevada is working with non -profit direct service providers to increase access of care for youth and adolescent, which may include working through partners engag ed with youth populations at schools, community centers, or other family serving organizations. In 2018 Nevada published Nevada's Behavioral Health Community Integration Strategic Plan and priorities included the following children's services: Juvenile justice diversion Residential treatment facility treatment capacity, discharges and linkages to services Transitional Age Youth services Access to services: crisis services, partial hospitalization programs (PHP), intensive outpatient progra mming (IOP), day treatment, wraparound, respite, family peer support and habilitation services. (DHHS, 2018) Nevada's children's behavioral health system encompasses the emotional, mental, physical, and social well -being of children from infancy through adolescence. Nevada incorporates a system of care (SOC) approach to children's mental health that guides the me thod in which services are delivered. The SOC is designed to meet the multiple and changing needs of families, children, and youth through a strength -based, family -driven, comprehensive, integrated, and coordinated continuum of services and supports. Overs ite of children's mental health is statutorily mandated through NRS Chapter 433 (state agencies only) and NRS 433B for Clark, Washoe, and Rural Children's Mental Health Consortiums. Division of Children and Family Services DCFS is responsible for the o peration of state -funded children's outpatient community mental health programs, residential programs, juvenile justice programs, and foster care programs. As legislated by NRS 433, the division is responsible for planning; administration; policy setting; monitoring; and budget development of all state -operated children's mental health programs in Washoe and Clark Counties. The DCFS Administrator coordinates the administration of children's behavioral health services with the SSA and the SMHA. In addition, the DCFS administration is also directly involved in decisions regarding agency structure; staffing; program administration; and budget development. DCFS receives oversight and direction through stakeholder and advisory groups: The Nevada Commission on Behavioral Health, the statewide Children's Behavioral Health Consortium and the Regional Children's Mental Health Consortia. The Regional Consortia are required by statute and offer recommendations on the children's behavioral health service -array to the Nevada Commission on Behavioral Health and to the legislature. These consortia are supported by staff from DCFS's Planning and Evaluation Unit (PEU). Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 16 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 16 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 52 of 305 16 DCFS is currently implementing its second four -year SAMHSA System of Care Expansion Grant, which is a complement to previous SOC grants DCFS was awarded, including a recent Expansion grant focused on urban Nevada. The division and its grant partner, Nevada Parents Encouraging Parents - Statewide Family Network (which offers training, resources, and support to parents who have children with disabilities ages 0 -26), share responsibility for implementing the grant. The current SOC grant focuses on building out the service array in Rural Nevada and creating an infrastructure for DCFS to serve as the Children's Mental Health Authority. In this role DCFS will set provider standards, provide training and technical assistance to providers, and will provide quality oversight over children's mental and behavioral health services in Nevada. Within Quality & Oversight, PEU and SOC grant -staff conduct strategic planning; provide trainings for providers; facilitate the implementation of evidence -based practices; and provid e quality assurance activities. DCFS staff also collaborate with Nevada's CCBHCs on training related to children's services; provide consultation to childcare centers, foster care providers, and juvenile justice facilities; and provide input in numerous statewide initiatives to improve access to services for youth. Other initiatives include collaborating with other Nevada divisions to determine the state's role in assuring, providing, funding, and regulating behavioral health services to promote comm unity integration; workforce development and training; and state planning for integrating physical and behavioral health including the division's recent Human Resources and Services Administration Pediatric Mental Health Access grant award. Children's Community -Based and Residential Services DCFS is a direct service provider and serves children and families who have fee -for-service Medicaid, have certain managed care Medicaid coverage, are uninsured, or are underinsured. DCFS provides services in the two urban areas of the state, a) Reno area (Northern Nevada) and b) Las Vegas area (Southern Nevada). In Las Vegas, DCFS has three neighborhood care centers, plus 24-hour care facilities. In Northern Nevada, there is one outpatient facility and several 24- hour care facilities. There are two youth centers located in rural Nevada. Outpatient behavioral health services for children in rural Nevada are provided by DPBH. Depending on the region, DCFS provides the following community -based services: Caliente Youth Center: This is a secure facility for male and female youth who are committed to DCFS by the juvenile court. The center follows a criminogenic model that targets the individuals' crime -producing needs in order to improve treatment outcomes and to red uce the risk of recidivism. Upon successful completion of the programming within the center, youth are released back into the community with supervision and case management services provided by Youth Parole. Youth committed for mental health treatment are placed directly on parole and receive treatment and case management services based on their identified needs . Desert Willow Treatment Center: This center provides intensive mental health services in a secure environment with both an acute care unit and a residential treatment unit. The acute care unit serves children with critical mental health conditions and provides short -term psychiatric, diagnostic, and stabilization services. The residential unit provides longer -term care to youth who cannot currently be served with community -based programming. Early Childhood Mental Health Services: These services are for children between birth Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 17 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 17 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 53 of 305 17 and six years of age who have emotional disturbances or who may be at high -risk for developing emotional and behavioral disturbances and the associated developmental delays. The goals of services are to strengthen parent -child relationships, support the family's capacity to care for their children, and enhance the child's social and emotional functioning. Services include: behavioral and psychological assessments; psychiatric services; family, individual, and group therapies and behavioral management; day treatment; clinical case management; in -home crisis intervention; childcare and pre - school consultation, outreach, parent training; and consultation to other child -serving providers. Mobile Crisis Response Teams: These teams provide information, crisis re sponse (at any location), and stabilization services to children and adolescents in the community up to age 18. The teams also provide up to 45 days of in -home stabilization services following a crisis response, and families are linked to their current pro vider or connected to new long -term services and supports. Services are available 24 hours per day. Nevada Youth Training Center: This is a staff -secure facility for male youth who are committed to DCFS by the juvenile court. The program follows a criminog enic model that targets the individuals' crime -producing needs in order to improve treatment outcomes and to reduce the risk of recidivism. Upon successful completion of the program, youth are released back into the community with supervision and case mana gement services provided by youth parole. Youth committed for mental health treatment are placed directly on parole and receive treatment and case management services based on their identified needs. Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facilities: These hi ghly structured, staff -secure treatment homes provide round -the-clock care, mental health assessment, psychiatric assessment and evaluation, psychoeducation, and mental health rehabilitation services. There are two facilities located in Northern Nevada and one located in Southern Nevada. Outpatient Mental Health Services: These community -based, family -oriented, mental health services are for children from 6 through 17 years of age. They include: clinical case management; psychiatric services; psychological assessment and evaluation; individual, family, and group therapies and behavioral management; care coordination with other child serving entities involved with the child and family; and 24 -hour on -call emergency professional coverage. Specialized Foster Care: Pursuant to NRS 424.041 -424.043, DCFS is authorized to act as the oversight body over specialized foster care. Specialized foster care is an \"advanced\" version of traditional foster care that targets youth who have behavioral or mental health needs that cannot be met in traditional family foster care; are struggling to maintain placement in traditional family foster care due to behavioral and emotional needs; have disrupted from a placement due to behavioral and mental health needs; and/or are returning or stepping down from a higher level of care. With specialized f oster care, staff provide foster parents with additional training, support, and consultation in order to provide specialized care and support to high -needs youth. Like other programs within a system of care approach, a fundamental assumption of treatment f oster care is that the most effective treatment environment for a youth is his/her home, community, and school. Within this model, foster parents pay close attention to the youth's behavior on a daily basis and are in close communication with other members of the youth's treatment team in order to provide individualized, coordinated treatment.

The program follows a crim inogenic model that targets the individuals' crime -producing needs in order to improve outcomes and to reduce the risk of recidivism. The center also includes an education program that is provided on -site through the Clark County School District. Wraparound in Nevada (WIN): WIN is an ecologically based process and approach to care planning that builds on the collective action of a committed group of family, friends, community, professionals, and cross -system supports. WIN mobilizes resources and ta lents from a variety of sources resulting in the creation of a plan of care that is the best fit between the family vision and story, team mission, strengths, needs, and strategies. WIN in Northern Nevada and Rural Nevada includes both High Fidelity Wrapar ound services and FOCUS. FOCUS is an intermediate care coordination model that supports youth and their families who do not rise to the intensive WIN level of care but who are multi -system involved, at risk of deeper system involvement, and whose challenge s exceed the resources of a single organization. OVERVIEW OF THE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SYSTEM Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Agency (SAPTA) is part of the Bureau of Behavioral Health Wellness and Prevention (BBHWP) within the DPBH. Pursuant to NRS 458.025 and the Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 458, SAPTA has the regulatory authority to govern the substance -related prevention and treatment programs and services. As such, SAPTA serves as the SSA for the Federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant. The role of the SSA with respect to the delivery of substance use disord er services includes: 1) formulation and implementation of a state plan for prevention, early intervention, treatment, and recovery support; 2) statewide coordination and distribution of all state and federal funding (tax dollars, general fund, and grants) for community -based public and nonprofit organizations; 3) development and publication of standards for certification , such as the requirement that certified programs adopt evidenced -based programs and practices ; and 4) certification of facilities, progra ms, and services. Certification of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Programs The State of Nevada has a comprehensive process to oversee the statewide substance use prevention and treatment programs. Programs receiving any state or federal funding through DPBH must be certified by the Division as required in NRS 458/NAC 458, which r elates to operational; personnel; programmatic; and clinical services. In addition, Medicaid Chapter 400 requires any programs seeking reimbursement for substance use treatment and/or co -occurring treatment under Provider Type 17 -215 be certified through S APTA under NAC 458 and Division Criteria established through NAC 458. SAPTA, through its contractor, the University of Nevada, Reno 's Center for the Application of Substance Abuse Technologies (CASAT) certifies the coalitions, prevention , and treatment pro grams based on the types of services they provide. SAPTA maintains an on -line, searchable database for treatment services with quality indicators to assist individuals in locating treatment programs across the state.

Co-Occurring Disorder Certification and Service Endorsements (Adult and Adolescent) - Providers with Service Endorsements are certified for specific treatment levels of service and receive an endorsement for Co -Occurring Disorder services based on the Dual Diagnosis Capability in Addiction Treatment (DDCAT) Rating Scale. The DDCAT is an evidence -based benchmark instrument for measuring a provider's capacity to deliver integrated services for persons with co -occurring mental health and substance use disorders. SAPTA uses the DDCAT to certify programs as Co -Occurring Capable or Co -Occurring Enhanced. Currently, 14 programs are certified as Co -Occurring Enhanced, and 100 programs are certified as Co - Occurring Disorder Capable. Drug Court Service (Adult and Adolescent) - Provides general assessment and referral for adult clients referred from local and state courts/municipalities related to alcohol and other drug violations.

Nevada Administrative Code (NA C) 458 outlines the requirements necessary to obtain program certification, and allows SAPTA or its designated contractor to inspect each program that is certified to determine if state certification should be continued. In addition to NAC 458, and Divisi on Criteria, programs are eligible to bill SAPTA if approved through the Request for Qualifications (RFQ) process which specifies the type of services to be provided and places specific requirements upon those programs receiving funding. Additionally, Prov iders who bill Medicaid under Provider Type 17 must be certified by SAPTA. \u00a7 State Certification is available to any alcohol and drug use program, which meets the requirements for certification identified in NAC 458. Certification can be for a perio d of up to two years. State Certification determines if a program has met minimum requirements related to service delivery. Certification is mandatory for all programs receiving SAPTA grant funding through the RFQ process and programs that bill Medicaid u nder Provider Type 17. Other than for DUI Evaluation Centers and Opioid Treatment Programs, certification is optional for programs that do not receive SAPTA funding or bill Medicaid under Provider Type 17. Certification determines if a program has the nece ssary organizational structure and staff to provide a specified service. Administrative Programs Programs receiving SAPTA funding, both directly and indirectly, are required to participate in compliance monitoring. This function is regulatory in nature and focuses on administrative, programming, and fiscal activities of a program. All administrative p rograms are mandated to participate in any evaluation process that is required by their funding sources. Funded and certified agencies must comply with all evaluation requirements set forth by both the state and the federal evaluators. Certified, Funded, Programs SAPTA currently certifies and funds 20 agencies for a total of 50 adult substance use treatment programs and a total of 21 certified adolescent substance use treatment programs. Certified, Non -Funded, Programs With the e xception of Driving Under the Influence (DUI) Evaluation Centers and Opioid Treatment Programs, certification is optional for programs not receiving SAPTA funding or not billing Medicaid under Provider Type 17 -215. DUI Evaluation Centers located within cou nties with populations of 100,000 or more are not funded by SAPTA but must be certified. Agencies that are not funded often choose to become certified in order to obtain Medicaid, to meet third -party requirements, to better compete for grants, or to meet t he requirements from drug courts and other types of courts that will only work with certified providers even though certification for those programs is not required in statute and regulations. SAPTA currently certifies, but does not fund, 69 agencies for a total of 81 adult substance use treatment programs and a total of 26 adolescent substance use treatment programs.

Pursuant to NAC 449, licensed residential substance use treatm ent facilities are overseen by the Nevada Bureau of Health Care Quality and Compliance (HCQC), which focuses on the health and safety aspects of licensing. Under NAC 449, programs using methadone for the treatment of an opioid use disorder must be licensed as a Narcotic Treatment Program by HCQC and must be certified by SAPTA as Ambulatory Withdrawal Management and Level 1 Outpatient. CASAT and HCQC work closely together to provide oversite and quality improvement of certified and licensed programs. Program Funding State General Funds - Financing behavioral health services in Nevada depends on state general fund revenue with contributions from grants and Medicaid. Each service system has its own budget established within the state system. The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP), also known as Nevada Medicaid, operates Medicaid Fee -For-Service (rural Nevada); the Managed Care Organizations (MCO) (urban Nevada); and the Care Management Organization (CMO) for patient centered care in rural Nevada. The prioritization of projects and funding is based on the Governor's performance -based budgeting, state strategic and need based plans, as approved by the Nevada State Legislature. With the cross -over of systems and supports, Nevada is able to utilize the sources of funding and resources mo st effectively. State General fund dollars are primarily used for funding infrastructure to expand services, prevention and treatment services, services for justice involved individuals, the re -entry population, and individuals/families with social services referrals in the state of Nevada. Substance Abuse Block Grant - Collaboration with our state Medicaid agency resulted in the addition of Medicaid coverage of substance use disorder services effective January 2014. This has offset the need for general fund and block grant funding for treatment services provided in the Medicaid -approved model. Medicaid generously worked with SAPTA to develop a Provider Type 17 agency model that resulte d in all nineteen providers being able to bill and be reimbursed by Medicaid. In response to the changing needs of the treatment delivery system, SAPTA is shifting its block grant funding previously needed for treatment that Medicaid normally pays for s uch as outpatient and intensive outpatient to enhancing \"gap\" service s. Some of these gap services include residential, transitional care, targeted case management, recovery -oriented systems of care, and expanding access to recovery support services for adolescents and adults. Mental Health Block Grant (MHBG ) | The expenditure plan has identified 5% for administration, 20% for youth/adolescent as mandatory set -asides. As required, Nevada is utilizing 10% of the MHBG supplemental funds to enhance and expand FEP Services through the existing service providers to expand the number of services and service recipients. State Opioid Response Grant - In October of 2018, Nevada was awarded a State Opioid Response Grant (SOR). Activities and services will build on the work accomplished during the 2017 -2020 funding cycle that established three integrated opioid treatment and recovery centers (IOTRCs) across the State of Nevada. The SOR program aims to address the opioid crisis by increasing Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 23 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 23 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 59 of 305 23 access to medication assisted treatment ( MAT ) using the three FDA -approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder; reducing unmet treatment need; and r educing opioid overdose related deaths through the provision of prevention, treatment, and recovery activities for opioid use disorder. As a SOR Grantee, the State of Nevada is expanding availability of MAT services and will provide supportive services in collaboration with SAPTA -certified behavioral health providers, CCBHCs, and the IOTRCs (when geographically able) in an effort to provide integrated primary and behavioral health care for adults and adolescents with opioid use disorder. In September of 2020, Nevada was awarded a No Cost Extension (NCE) for the State Opioid Response Grant (SOR I) and the first year of Nevada State Opioid Response II (SOR II). Between September 30, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the Nevada State Opioid Response project funded 1 5 activities under the NCE and an additional 19 under the SOR II to a total of 22 agencies. All agencies supported through NCE were a continuation of funding from Year 2 of SOR I. Activities and services have expanded on the initial SOR funding to build o n the work accomplished during the past funding cycle that supports Nevada's identified priority areas: 1) Prescriber Education & Guidelines, 2) Treatment Options & Third -Party Payers, 3) Data Collection & Intelligence Sharing, 4) Criminal Justice Interven tions. The SOR program aims to address the opioid crisis by increasing access to MAT using the three FDA-approved medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder; reducing unmet treatment need; and reducing opioid overdose related deaths through the provision of prevention, treatment, and recovery activities for opioid use disorder. As a SOR Grantee, the State of Nevada is expanding availability of MAT services and will provide supportive services in collaboration with SAPTA -certified behavioral heal th providers, CCBHCs, and the IOTRCs (when geographically able) to provide integrated primary and behavioral health care for adults and adolescents with opioid use disorder. Focus areas for the SOR funding include outpatient clinical treatment and recovery services, MAT expansion for SAPTA -certified providers, tribal treatment and recovery services, criminal justice treatment and recovery services, peer recovery support services, community preparedness planning for tribal communities, mobile opioid recovery outreach teams, and neonatal abstinence syndrome prevention. Nevada continues to concentrate on expansion of evidence -based technical assistance to include key resources to assist organizations with Adopt SBIRT, which was expanded to 2 Federally Qualifi ed Health Center s (FQHC) and targeted OB/GYN and physicians serving women of childbearing age. Ongoing supports provided state -wide distribution of no -cost naloxone kits, that includes Nevada overdose education which has been funded through the Opioid STR NCE and the SOR Suppleme nt funding. Wrap around treatment and recovery support services have been expanded to include attention to special populations, such as veterans and faith -based supports and increased adoption of peer -based services. The implementation of the Zero Suicide initiative enhanced screening and service coordination with hospitals throughout Nevada. Nevada is also supporting further criminal justice -involved programs including expansion to support a MAT re -entry program that included transitional housing, resident ial treatment ad needed and coordination of treatment, care coordination and job development, jail-based MAT services, and naloxone discharge programs. Approximately twenty -two unique providers are being funded under the SOR funding streams. Implementing Zero Suicide . A position within the Office of Suicide Prevention was established to coordinate with hospitals throughout Nevada to initiate the adoption of Zero Suicide and begin Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 24 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 24 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 60 of 305 24 to introduce Crisis Now to communities. This position has worked individuall y with hospital systems throughout the state to commit to implementing Zero Suicide. The coordinator is providing ongoing TA to the 9 of the 12 hospital systems for participating hospitals from the first learning series from April to August 2020.The monthl y meetings allow for sharing EHR questions or concerns, changes in hospital leadership, data collection and evaluation, and policy and procedure updates. There are five (5) more COLs scheduled for this cohort. One of the first hospital systems that complet ed the initial training series over the summer of 2020 has adopted Zero Suicide initiatives within their EHR system that will launch fall 2021. The Zero Suicide coordinator has been providing ongoing TA to ensure that appropriate screenings and measures are embedded within the EHR and w orkflow. The Zero Suicide team has received commitment from five (5) new hospital systems to participate in the second round of training series for Zero Suicide with a goal of ten (10) systems. The team has been working with each hospital independently to complete a hospital wide readiness assessment. These assessments will then be used to guide specific trainings for hospital staff, policy and procedure development, and individualized TA throughout and following the training series. These trainings may inc lude safety planning training, SafeTalk, ASIST, counseling for access to lethal means, Columbia Assessment Tool, and CAMS training as well as peer input from the first round. Service Expansion . Nevada's behavioral health services have been evolving consi derably since the expansion of Medicaid in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Prior to 2014, the majority of behavioral health care services for individuals in poverty, who were otherwise not eligible for Medicaid, were provided within the state system. After Nevada expanded Medicaid , under Governor Brian Sandova l, the numbers of individuals covered by Medicaid benefits grew exponentially from 351,315 in 2013 to 655,366 in 2018. At the same time, Nevada expanded substance use treatment benefits through an integrated behavioral health clinic model to provide substance -related and/or co -occurring conditions treatment for outpatient and inpatient clients using ASAM as the framework for assess ment and for matching multidimensional severity and level of function with type and intensity of service . In addition, Nevada participated in the 223 Demonstration Program to develop and implement (CCBHCs ). Under the demonstration program , Nevada has three active CCBHCs: New Frontier Treatment Center in Fallon, Nevada (rural) ; Vitality Unlimited in Elko, Nevada (rural) ; and Bridge Counseling in Las Vegas , Nevada (urban). The implementation of CCBHCs has expanded accessibility, availability , and the scope of services available in the communities with CCBHCs. Further , under the demonstration program, CCBHCs expanded the scope of community based behavioral health agencies to include non -state plan services, such as chronic disease self - management ; supported empl oyment ; and targeted case management for individuals with primary substance -related disorders. The CCBHCs also expanded their scope of services to allow them to provide state plan services in an integrated setting to include: MAT ; ambulatory withdrawal management ; primary care services ; 24/7 crisis intervention , which includes mobile crisis ; psychiatric rehabilitation services , such as basic skills training and psychosocial rehabilitation ; Assertive Community Services ; and family -to-family peer interventions. Communities in which CCBHCs operate have benefited from greater access to behavioral health and primary care services including a reduction in the number of unnecessary episodes of care in the emergency departments. As such, the CCBHCs have become essentia l safety -net behavioral health service providers in Nevada. The demonstration program ended in July of 2019, and Nevada has been working with the Division of Health Care Finance and Policy (DHCFP_ to develop a 1915(b4) expansion in Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 25 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 25 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 61 of 305 25 order to continue reimbursement for services provided by CCBHCs. In total the state has 16 CCBHC's Nine are Medicaid enrolled providers and seven are SAMHSA Direct funded working on establishing programming. Additional Information to Note : All Nevada CCBHCs must provide ACT services. Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 26 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 26 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 62 of 305 26 Those enrolled with Medicaid knew this requirement upon applying to become a Nevada CCBHC, and all Medicaid enrolled programs should have an ACT program up and running. The pandemic has impacted Cohort 2's ACT implementation because many of them were certified between the second half of 2019 and April 2020. Initial certification does not require a fully functioning ACT, as this program takes time to build and is resource heavy, so newly certified CCBHCs are gi ven 6 months to build their ACT program after initial certification. This 6 month build period put most of Cohort 2's ACT program due date just around when the pandemic hit and shut down many in -person services. Currently there is only one Cohort 2 CCBHC (FirstMed) that does not have a functioning ACT team. Those who have been directly funded by SAMHSA did not necessarily know about this state requirement and may have barriers with implementing this service due to the possibility of not accounting f or this service in their grant application and fund allocation. As far as certification goes, they are still required to plan for and offer ACT services, though due to how resource heavy this particular program is, they may not be able to implement this service in a meaningful way until they are able to enroll with Medicaid or get additional funding elsewhere. Nevada Medicaid cannot enroll anymore CCBHCs until they are authorized more spots for this specialty enrollment through the next legislative session . There is no guarantee more spots will be authorized. Carson Tahoe Hospital has two ACT programs, one regular ACT Team and the other is a FACT (Forensic ACT) Team, which focuses on consumers in the legal system. SAPTA Substance -Related Disorder Specialt y Populations SAPTA has a Special Populations Plan that specifically addresses the needs of four specialty populations: 1) adolescents ; 2) women who are p regnant and parenti ng; and 3) people who are injection drug users. SAPTA also provides for the special needs of people who are involved in the criminal justice system. Adolescents: Considerations for this specialty population include: gender, ethnicity, disability status, stage of readiness for change, sexual orientatio n, cultural background , cognitive and social -emotional development issues resulting from the adolescent's substance use , and the role of the family as it relates to sustaining the adolescent's continued substance use . Additional areas of concern are : how to provide necessary services for adolescents in rural or frontier areas where limited accessibility presents a significant obstacle to treatment access , how to best serve those who are involved in the juvenile -justice system , and how to provide age-appropriate detention programming . Women who are pregnant and parenting: Primary medical services for this population include: prenatal intake; prenatal follow -up; labor/delivery with prenatal follow -up; neonatal follow -up and nutritional considerations; primary pediatric care for their children, including immunizations. Therapeutic interventions are provided for children of women in treatment to address the children's developmental needs and to address any issues resulting from sexual abuse, physical abuse, and /or neglect. Psychosocial services include trauma counseling for women who have experienced sexual or physical abuse , mental health counseling for all family members , and general family services including assisting the wom en to plan for reunification with their other children. Additional services include case management, child care, housing assistance, home management training, transportation, life skills training, parenting Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 27 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 27 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 63 of 305 27 training, vocational training and job -skill devel opment, education programs, and legal assistance. People who are injection drug users: Services for this population include comprehensive substance -related treatment , on-going and continuing care with community providers , medication assisted treatment for individuals with opioid use disorders , recovery supports, such as housing assistance , legal resource access , vocational and job -skill building , and outreach services that adhere to the National Institute of Drug Abuse's C ommunity Based Outreach Model, which is used to identify potential and to provide them with risk -reduction interventions. People who are involved in the criminal justice system : SAPTA provides a variety of residential and transitional living programs for people re -entering society from prison or jail. Transitional services include but are not limited to : cognitive -behavioral therapy, mental health counseling, trauma informed care, peer support services, skills training, and vocational services and job training. The agency also funds drug court programs which provide a sentencing alternative of treatment combined with supervision for people living with serious substance -related disorders . Substance Use Prevention SAPTA is responsible for prevention services and is responsible for ensuring the state uses a variety of evidence -based programs, policies, and practices in their prevention efforts. Nevada Administrative Code (NAC) 458 identifies three areas relating to the use of alcohol and other drugs: a) Prevention Programs , b) Coalition Programs, and c) Administrative Programs. Prevention Programs SAPTA currently approves six strategies to prevent the initial onset of substance -related disorders and to eliminate or reduce the harmful effects of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs in individuals, families , and communities. The methods are recognized by SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP), and all SAPTA -funded prevention programs use a structure that is based on one or more of these strategies: a) Information Dissemination, b) Education, c) Alternative s, d) Problem Identification and Referral, e) Community -Based Process, and f) Environmental : a) Information Dissemination: This strategy provides awareness and knowledge of the nature and extent of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use, abuse, and addiction and their effects on individuals, families, and communities. It also provides knowledge and awa reness of available prevention programs and services. The method is characterized by one -way communication from the source to the audience, with limited contact between the two. b) Education: This strategy involves two -way communication and is distinguished from the information dissemination strategy by the fact that interaction between the educator/ facilitator and the participants is the basis of its activities. Activities under this method are intended to affect critical life and social skills, including decision -making ; refusal skills ; critical analysis (e.g., of media messages) ; and systematic judgment abilities. c) Alternative s: This strategy provides for the participation of target populat ions in activities that decrease alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use. The assumption is constructive and healthy activities offset the attraction to, or otherwise meet, the needs usually filled by alcohol and other drugs and would, therefore, minimize or obviate resort to the latter.

The intent is to assess if the behavior of these individuals can be reversed through education. This strategy does not include any activity designed to determine if a person needs treatment. e) Community -Based Process: This strategy aims to improve the community 's abili ty to more effectively provide prevention services for alcohol, tobacco, and other substance -related disorders. Activities in this strategy include : organizing, planning, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness of service implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking. f) Environmental: This strategy influences the incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs i n the general population. This is achieved by establishing or changing written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes. This method is divided into two subcategories to permit distinction between activities : a) legal and regulatory initiatives and b) service and action -oriented initiatives. Prevention Classifications The prevention interventions are divided into five classifications based on the service delivery method and on the targeted population: Universal : Targets the general public or a whole population group that has not been identified on the basis of individual risk. Universal Direct : Directly serves an id entifiable group of people who have not been identified on the basis of individual risk (e.g., school curriculum, afterschool program, parenting class). This also could include interventions involving interpersonal and ongoing/repeated contact (e.g., coali tions). Universal Indirect : Supports population -based programs and environmental strategies (e.g., establishing pertinent policies and modifying advertising practices) and could include interventions involving programs and policies implemented by coalitio ns. Selective : Targets subsets of the total population deemed to be at risk for a substance - related disorder s by virtue of their membership in a particular population segment (e.g., children of parents with substance -related disorders, students who are failing academically, or students who dropout). Risk groups may be identified on the basis of biological ; psycho logical ; social ; or environmental risk factors known to be associated with substance misuse, and targeted subgroups may be defined by age; gender; family history; place of residence, such as high drug -use or low-income neighborhoods; and victimization by p hysical and/or sexual abuse. Selective prevention strategies target the entire subgroup regardless of the degree of risk of any individual within the group. The selective prevention program is presented to the entire subgroup because the subgroup as a whol e is at higher risk for a substance -related disorder s than the general population. An individual's personal risk is not specifically assessed or identified and is based solely on a presumption given his or her membership in the at -risk subgroup (e.g., chil dren of parents who have substance -related disorders). Indicated : Identifies individuals who are exhibiting early signs of a substance - related disorder or other problem behaviors associated with a substance -related disorder (e.g., falling grades and consumption of alcohol and other gateway drugs) and targets them with special programs. These interventions are designed to prevent the onse t of a Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 29 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 29 of 30 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 65 of 305 29 substance related disorder for individuals who do not meet the DSM -5 criteria for a substance use disorder. Prevention Coalitions There are 10 substance abuse prevention coalitions that serve all 17 counties in the state. Each coalition must have a board of directors, and the board must be broadly representative of the community and geographic area to be served. The coalitions are funded by Nevada's State General Fund through SAPTA and by discretionary grants from SAMHSA's CSAP. SAPTA oversees the coalitions to ensure they implement evidence -based prevention strategies as recommended by the federal and state governments. The coalitions are restricted from providing direct services. However, they act as pass -through entities to fund prevention services at the community level. This restriction is to ensure there will be no conflict of interest between the coalitions as funding/oversight organizations and the direct service providers in their communities. T he coalitions provide environmental strategies , information dissemination , and community -based strategies, which include developing needs assessments , coordinating data collection , developing comprehensive community prevention plans , implementing the plans , and evaluating outcomes.

Narrative Question: This step should identify the unmet service needs and critical gaps in the state's current M/SUD system of care as well as the data sources used to identify the needs and gaps of the required populations relevant to each block grant within the state's M/SUD system of care. States should also continue to use the prevalence formulas for adults with SMI and children with SED, as well as the prevalence estimates, epidemiological analyses, and profiles to establish mental health treatment, SUD prevention, and SUD treatment goals at the state level.

The most recent HIV Surveillance Report published on or before October 1 of the federal fiscal year for which a state is applying for a grant is used to determine the states and jurisdictions that will be required to set-aside 5 percent of their respective SABG allotments to establish one or more projects to provide early intervention services regarding the human immunodeficiency virus (EIS/HIV) at the sites at which individuals are receiving SUD treatment services. In FY 2012, SAMHSA developed and disseminated a policy change applicable to the EIS/HIV which provided any state that was a \"designated state\" in any of the three years prior to the year for which a state is applying for SABG funds with the flexibility to obligate and expend SABG funds for EIS/HIV even though the state's AIDS case rate does not meet the AIDS case rate threshold for the fiscal year involved for which a state is applying for SABG funds. Therefore, any state with an AIDS case rate below 10 or more such cases per 100,000 that meets the criteria described in the 2012 policy guidance would will be allowed to obligate and expend SABG funds for EIS/HIV if they chose 2 of 2 Printed: 8/18/2021 6:50 PM - Nevada Page 2 of 2 Printed: 8/26/2021 3:04 PM - Nevada Page 2 of 2 Printed: 8/26/2021 4:19 PM - Nevada Page 2 of 2 Printed: 9/2/2021 12:57 PM - Nevada Page 2 of 2 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 2 of 2 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 131 of 305Planning Tables Table 5a SABG Primary Prevention Planned Expenditures Planning Period Start Date: 10/1/2021 Planning Period End Date: 9/30/2023 A B Strategy IOM Target FFY 2022 SA Block Grant Award COVID-191 ARP2 1.

The Health Care System, Parity and Integration - Question 1 and 2 are Required Narrative Question Persons with mental illness and persons with substance use disorders are likely to die earlier than those who do not have these conditions.22 Early mortality is associated with broader health disparities and health equity issues such as socioeconomic status but \"[h]ealth system factors\" such as access to care also play an important role in morbidity and mortality among these populations. Persons with mental illness and substance use disorders may benefit from strategies to control weight, encourage exercise, and properly treat such chronic health conditions as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.23 It has been acknowledged that there is a high rate of co-occurring M/SUD, with appropriate treatment required for both conditions.24 Currently, 50 states have organizationally consolidated their mental and substance use disorder authorities in one fashion or another with additional organizational changes under consideration. More broadly, SAMHSA and its federal partners understand that such factors as education, housing, and nutrition strongly affect the overall health and well-being of persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.25 SMHAs and SSAs may wish to develop and support partnerships and programs to help address social determinants of health and advance overall health equity.26 For instance, some organizations have established medical-legal partnerships to assist persons with mental and substance use disorders in meeting their housing, employment, and education needs.27 Health care professionals and persons who access M/SUD treatment services recognize the need for improved coordination of care and integration of physical and M/SUD with other health care in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative care settings in the community. For instance, the National Alliance for Mental Illness has published materials for members to assist them in coordinating pediatric mental health and primary care.28 SAMHSA and its partners support integrated care for persons with mental illness and substance use disorders.29 The state should illustrate movement towards integrated systems of care for individuals and families with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. The plan should describe attention to management, funding, payment strategies that foster co-occurring capability for services to individuals and families with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders. Strategies supported by SAMHSA to foster integration of physical and M/SUD include: developing models for inclusion of M/SUD treatment in primary care; supporting innovative payment and financing strategies and delivery system reforms such as ACOs, health homes, pay for performance, etc.; promoting workforce recruitment, retention and training efforts; improving understanding of financial sustainability and billing requirements; encouraging collaboration between M/SUD providers, prevention of teen pregnancy, youth violence, Medicaid programs, and primary care providers such as Federally Qualified Health Centers; and sharing with consumers information about the full range of health and wellness programs. Health information technology, including EHRs and telehealth are examples of important strategies to promote integrated care.30 Use of EHRs - in full compliance with applicable legal requirements - may allow providers to share information, coordinate care, and improve billing practices. Telehealth is another important tool that may allow M/SUD prevention, treatment, and recovery to be conveniently provided in a variety of settings, helping to expand access, improve efficiency, save time, and reduce costs. Development and use of models for coordinated, integrated care such as those found in health homes31 and ACOs32 may be important strategies used by SMHAs and SSAs to foster integrated care. Training and assisting M/SUD providers to redesign or implement new provider billing practices, build capacity for third-party contract negotiations, collaborate with health clinics and other organizations and provider networks, and coordinate benefits among multiple funding sources may be important ways to foster integrated care. SAMHSA encourages SMHAs and SSAs to communicate frequently with stakeholders, including policymakers at the state/jurisdictional and local levels, and State Mental Health Planning Council members and consumers, about efforts to foster health care coverage, access and integrate care to ensure beneficial outcomes. SMHAs and SSAs also may work with state Medicaid agencies, state insurance commissioners, and professional organizations to encourage development of innovative demonstration projects, alternative payment methodologies, and waivers/state plan amendments that test approaches to providing integrated care for persons with M/SUD and other vulnerable populations.33 Ensuring both Medicaid and private insurers provide required preventive benefits also may be an area for collaboration.34 One key population of concern is persons who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid.35 Roughly, 30 percent of persons who are dually eligible have been diagnosed with a mental illness, more than three times the rate among those who are not dually eligible.36 SMHAs and SSAs also should collaborate with state Medicaid agencies and state insurance commissioners to develop policies to assist those individuals who experience health insurance coverage eligibility changes due to shifts in income and employment.37 Moreover, even with expanded health coverage available through the Marketplace and Medicaid and efforts to ensure parity in health care coverage, persons with M/SUD conditions still may experience challenges in some areas in obtaining care for a particular condition or in finding a provider.38 SMHAs and SSAs should remain cognizant that health disparities may affect access, health care coverage and integrated care of M/SUD conditions and work with Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 1 of 4 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 140 of 305partners to mitigate regional and local variations in services that detrimentally affect access to care and integration. SMHAs and SSAs should work with partners to ensure recruitment of diverse, well-trained staff and promote workforce development and ability to function in an integrated care environment.39 Psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, addiction counselors, preventionists, therapists, technicians, peer support specialists, and others will need to understand integrated care models, concepts, and practices. Parity is vital to ensuring persons with mental health conditions and substance use disorders receive continuous, coordinated, care. Increasing public awareness about MHPAEA could increase access to M/SUD services, provide financial benefits to individuals and families, and lead to reduced confusion and discrimination associated with mental illness and substance use disorders. Block grant recipients should continue to monitor federal parity regulations and guidance and collaborate with state Medicaid authorities, insurance regulators, insurers, employers, providers, consumers and policymakers to ensure effective parity implementation and comprehensive, consistent communication with stakeholders. The SSAs, SMHAs and their partners may wish to pursue strategies to provide information, education, and technical assistance on parity-related issues. Medicaid programs will be a key partner for recipients of MHBG and SABG funds and providers supported by these funds. The SSAs and SMHAs should collaborate with their states' Medicaid authority in ensuring parity within Medicaid programs. SAMHSA encourages states to take proactive steps to improve consumer knowledge about parity. As one plan of action, states can develop communication plans to provide and address key issues. Another key part of integration will be defining performance and outcome measures. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and partners have developed the National Quality Strategy, which includes information and resources to help promote health, good outcomes, and patient engagement. SAMHSA's National Behavioral Health Quality Framework includes core measures that may be used by providers and payers.40 SAMHSA recognizes that certain jurisdictions receiving block grant funds - including U.S. Territories, tribal entities and those jurisdictions that have signed a Compact of Free Association with the United States and are uniquely impacted by certain Medicaid provisions or are ineligible to participate in certain programs.41 However, these jurisdictions should collaborate with federal agencies and their governmental and non- governmental partners to expand access and coverage. Furthermore, the jurisdiction should ensure integration of prevention, treatment, and recovery support for persons with, or at risk of, mental and substance use disorders. 22 BG Druss et al.

Describe how the state integrates mental health and primary health care, including services for individuals with co-occurring mental and substance use disorders, in primary care settings or arrangements to provide primary and specialty care services in community -based mental and substance use disorders settings. The State of Nevada works to integrate mental and primary health by partnering with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC), Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers (CCBHC), the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the University of Nevada, Reno outpatient clinics, In addition, as part of the ongoing partnerships, Mental Health is moving to provide expand service capacity by partnering with organizations that bring medical services into behavioral health such as Desert Parkway Behavioral Health and Reno Behavioral Health or bring behavioral health services into the medical clinics such as the rural health clinics. The integration of care is a consideration and identified as a priority in funding announcements. 2. Describe how the state provides services and supports towards integrated systems of care for individuals and families with co- occurring mental and substance use disorders, including management, funding, and payment strategies that foster co-occurring capability. The Department of Health and Human Services includes public and behavioral health services. The Director's Office provided infrastructure incubator funds (general funds) for FQHCs to expand telehealth to include behavioral services and even MAT treatment. The CCBHC is a prospective payment rate that provide integrated systems of care for individuals, with a bundled rate. Nevada is also working with Medicaid to expand and enhance the ability of primary care providers to bring behavioral health screening as an allowable activity into primary practice, so they would be able to bill for the screening and a medical service. In addition, Nevada has been working on crisis triage centers (currently two of them) which include medical screenings and releases, as part of the behavioral health care treatment services. 3. a) Is there a plan for monitoring whether individuals and families have access to M/SUD services offered through Qualified Health Plans? nmlkj Yes nmlkji No b) and Medicaid? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 4. Who is responsible for monitoring access to M/SUD services provided by the QHP? Commissioner of the Division of Insurance 5.

Is the SSA and SMHA involved in the implementation and enforcement of parity protections for mental and substance use disorder services? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 9. What are the issues or problems that your state is facing related to the implementation and enforcement of parity provisions? Nevada has a vast geographic area where some areas have more than a two hour drive to access any type of medical or behavioral health service. In addition, there are limited services in the rural and frontier communities. There is a stigma associated with accessing care for many of our tribal and BIPOC communities. Nevada communities also have limited access to bandwidth and in some instances, have shared they do not want telehealth but services in person (tribal partners). With Nevada being in a HRSA mental health personnel shortage area, this is a challenge in addressing parity provisions. However, Nevada has been launching teams into rural and frontier communities and has been working to gain trust with person-to-person services in at-risk and BIPOC communities to bridge these gaps. 10. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? Nevada has made significant investments in expanding access to integrated care. Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics were expanded from three to nine clinics with SAPTA and Mental Health Block Grant funding. The CCBHC's are now enrolled providers in Nevada Medicaid. In collaboration with Nevada Medicaid, Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) are now covered services. Technical assistance, training, and provider toolkits have been developed to support provider implementation of SBIRT in Ob/Gyn settings as well and Labor and Delivery as well as FQHC's. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section No technical assistance requested at this time.

Health Disparities - Requested Narrative Question In accordance with the HHS Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities42, Healthy People, 202043, National Stakeholder Strategy for Achieving Health Equity44, and other HHS and federal policy recommendations, SAMHSA expects block grant dollars to support equity in access, services provided, and M/SUD outcomes among individuals of all cultures, sexual/gender minorities, orientation and ethnicities. Accordingly, grantees should collect and use data to: (1) identify subpopulations (i.e., racial, ethnic, limited English speaking, tribal, sexual/gender minority groups, etc.) vulnerable to health disparities and (2) implement strategies to decrease the disparities in access, service use, and outcomes both within those subpopulations and in comparison to the general population. One strategy for addressing health disparities is use of the recently revised National Standards for Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services in Health and Health Care (CLAS)45. The Action Plan to Reduce Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, which the HHS Secretary released in April 2011, outlines goals and actions that HHS agencies, including SAMHSA, will take to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic minorities. Agencies are required to assess the impact of their policies and programs on health disparities. The HHS Secretary's top priority in the Action Plan is to \"assess and heighten the impact of all HHS policies, programs, processes, and resource decisions to reduce health disparities. HHS leadership will assure that program grantees, as applicable, will be required to submit health disparity impact statements as part of their grant applications. Such statements can inform future HHS investments and policy goals, and in some instances, could be used to score grant applications if underlying program authority permits.\"46 Collecting appropriate data is a critical part of efforts to reduce health disparities and promote equity. In October 2011, HHS issued final standards on the collection of race, ethnicity, primary language, and disability status47. This guidance conforms to the existing Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directive on racial/ethnic categories with the expansion of intra-group, detailed data for the Latino and the Asian-American/Pacific Islander populations48. In addition, SAMHSA and all other HHS agencies have updated their limited English proficiency plans and, accordingly, will expect block grant dollars to support a reduction in disparities related to access, service use, and outcomes that are associated with limited English proficiency. These three departmental initiatives, along with SAMHSA's and HHS's attention to special service needs and disparities within tribal populations, LGBTQ populations, and women and girls, provide the foundation for addressing health disparities in the service delivery system. States provide M/SUD services to these individuals with state block grant dollars. While the block grant generally requires the use of evidence-based and promising practices, it is important to note that many of these practices have not been normed on various diverse racial and ethnic populations. States should strive to implement evidence-based and promising practices in a manner that meets the needs of the populations they serve. In the block grant application, states define the populations they intend to serve. Within these populations of focus are subpopulations that may have disparate access to, use of, or outcomes from provided services. These disparities may be the result of differences in insurance coverage, language, beliefs, norms, values, and/or socioeconomic factors specific to that subpopulation. For instance, lack of Spanish primary care services may contribute to a heightened risk for metabolic disorders among Latino adults with SMI; and American Indian/Alaska Native youth may have an increased incidence of underage binge drinking due to coping patterns related to historical trauma within the American Indian/Alaska Native community. While these factors might not be pervasive among the general population served by the block grant, they may be predominant among subpopulations or groups vulnerable to disparities. To address and ultimately reduce disparities, it is important for states to have a detailed understanding of who is and is not being served within the community, including in what languages, in order to implement appropriate outreach and engagement strategies for diverse populations. The types of services provided, retention in services, and outcomes are critical measures of quality and outcomes of care for diverse groups. For states to address the potentially disparate impact of their block grant funded efforts, they will address access, use, and outcomes for subpopulations. 42 http://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/HHS/HHS_Plan_complete.pdf 43 http://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/default.aspx 44 https://www.minorityhealth.hhs.gov/npa/files/Plans/NSS/NSS_07_Section3.pdf 45 http://www.ThinkCulturalHealth.hhs.gov Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 1 of 3 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 144 of 305Please respond to the following items: 1. Does the state track access or enrollment in services, types of services received and outcomes of these services by: race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and age? a) Race nmlkji Yes nmlkj No b) Ethnicity nmlkji Yes nmlkj No c) Gender nmlkji Yes nmlkj No d) Sexual orientation nmlkj Yes nmlkji No e) Gender identity nmlkji Yes nmlkj No f) Age nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 2. Does the state have a data-driven plan to address and reduce disparities in access, service use and outcomes for the above sub-population? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 3. Does the state have a plan to identify, address and monitor linguistic disparities/language barriers? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 4. Does the state have a workforce-training plan to build the capacity of M/SUD providers to identify disparities in access, services received, and outcomes and provide support for improved culturally and linguistically competent outreach, engagement, prevention, treatment, and recovery services for diverse populations? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 5. If yes, does this plan include the Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services(CLAS) Standards? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 6. Does the state have a budget item allocated to identifying and remediating disparities in M/SUD care? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No 7. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? Nevada has the funding through the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Health Disparity Grant to identify and remediate disparities in and for access to M/SUD care through an aggressive and data-driven program centered with the Nevada Office of Minority Health and Equity and Minority Health and Equity Coalition partners. The Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) which includes the Bureau of Behavioral Health Wellness and Prevention works collaboratively with the Nevada Office of Minority Health and Equity to track health disparities among high-risk and underserved, including racial and ethnic minority populations rural populations. Nevada is utilizing funds from the CDC Health Disparity Grant to expand data collection to include gender identity and to develop a more robust technology focused on data-driven initiatives, which includes trending and data analysis. This is expected to result in improved access to care for those with serious mental illness, substance use disorder, or co-occurring and to reduce the stigma in many at-risk communities on seeking support. Nevada completed the Minority Health Report in February 2021, to highlight existing health disparities by race and ethnicity in Nevada and is expanding data collection to include gender identity as well as those with substance use disorder as part of the focus on at-risk populations. This will also include area of residence (i.e. rural, frontier or urban communities). The impact of COVID-19 further exacerbated the challenges of access to healthcare for certain populations. Black, Indigenous, and Latinx people, immigrants, low wage earners, and economy driven professions who have low access to paid sick leave and medical leave. These populations experience reduced access to health care, and is exacerbated by lack of medical insurance or being underinsured. People of color, immigrants, non-English speakers, and individuals with low socioeconomic status tend to have lower health literacy. This has required Nevada to expand efforts within the Bureau to improve health equity through peer-to- peer, provider health equity toolkits, and tailored messaging utilizing Community Based Participatory Research. The Nevada Office of Minority Health works collaboratively with all divisions to improve the quality of health care services for members of minority groups, increase access to health care services, to seek and provide education, and to address, treat and prevent diseases and conditions that are prevalent among minority and underserved populations. Nevada is also working with the LGBTQ, religious, and immigrant populations to address access to health services and addressing stigma associated with accessing care. In addition, Nevada will be adding quality assurance measures as party of program monitoring to request copies of health disparity plans and/or to provide access for technical assistance in developing health disparity plans for those funded with federal dollars. This will continue efforts focused on expanding and improving access to M/SUD care in Nevada.

Innovation in Purchasing Decisions - Requested Narrative Question While there are different ways to define value-based purchasing, its purpose is to identify services, payment arrangements, incentives, and players that can be included in directed strategies using purchasing practices that are aimed at improving the value of health care services. In short, health care value is a function of both cost and quality: Health Care Value = Quality \u00f7 Cost, ( V = Q \u00f7 C ) SAMHSA anticipates that the movement toward value based purchasing will continue as delivery system reforms continue to shape states systems. The identification and replication of such value-based strategies and structures will be important to the development of M/SUD systems and services. There is increased interest in having a better understanding of the evidence that supports the delivery of medical and specialty care including M/SUD services. Over the past several years, SAMHSA has collaborated with CMS, HRSA, SMAs, state M/SUD authorities, legislators, and others regarding the evidence of various mental and substance misuse prevention, treatment, and recovery support services. States and other purchasers are requesting information on evidence-based practices or other procedures that result in better health outcomes for individuals and the general population. While the emphasis on evidence-based practices will continue, there is a need to develop and create new interventions and technologies and in turn, to establish the evidence. SAMHSA supports states' use of the block grants for this purpose. The NQF and the IOM recommend that evidence play a critical role in designing health benefits for individuals enrolled in commercial insurance, Medicaid, and Medicare. To respond to these inquiries and recommendations, SAMHSA has undertaken several activities. SAMHSA's Evidence Based Practices Resource Center assesses the research evaluating an intervention's impact on outcomes and provides information on available resources to facilitate the effective dissemination and implementation of the program. SAMHSA's Evidence-Based Practices Resource Center provides the information & tools needed to incorporate evidence-based practices into communities or clinical settings. SAMHSA reviewed and analyzed the current evidence for a wide range of interventions for individuals with mental illness and substance use disorders, including youth and adults with chronic addiction disorders, adults with SMI, and children and youth with SED. The evidence builds on the evidence and consensus standards that have been developed in many national reports over the last decade or more. These include reports by the Surgeon General,49 The New Freedom Commission on Mental Health,50 the IOM,51 NQF,and the Interdepartmental Serious Mental Illness Coordinating Committee (ISMICC).52. The activity included a systematic assessment of the current research findings for the effectiveness of the services using a strict set of evidentiary standards. This series of assessments was published in \"Psychiatry Online.\"53 SAMHSA and other federal partners, the HHS' Administration for Children and Families, Office for Civil Rights, and CMS, have used this information to sponsor technical expert panels that provide specific recommendations to the M/SUD field regarding what the evidence indicates works and for whom, to identify specific strategies for embedding these practices in provider organizations, and to recommend additional service research. In addition to evidence-based practices, there are also many promising practices in various stages of development. Anecdotal evidence and program data indicate effectiveness for these services. As these practices continue to be evaluated, the evidence is collected to establish their efficacy and to advance the knowledge of the field. SAMHSA's Treatment Improvement Protocol Series (TIPS)54 are best practice guidelines for the SUD treatment. SAMHSA draws on the experience and knowledge of clinical, research, and administrative experts to produce the TIPS, which are distributed to a growing number of facilities and individuals across the country. The audience for the TIPS is expanding beyond public and private SUD treatment facilities as alcohol and other drug disorders are increasingly recognized as a major health problem. SAMHSA's Evidence-Based Practice Knowledge Informing Transformation (KIT)55 was developed to help move the latest information available on effective M/SUD practices into community-based service delivery. States, communities, administrators, practitioners, consumers of mental health care, and their family members can use KIT to design and implement M/SUD practices that work. KIT covers getting started, building the program, training frontline staff, and evaluating the program. The KITs contain information sheets, introductory videos, practice demonstration videos, and training manuals. Each KIT outlines the essential components of the evidence-based practice and provides suggestions collected from those who have successfully implemented them.

Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? The state also utilizes open and competitive process for master service agreements (MSAs) to expedite the evaluation of qualified vendors so that dollars from federal awards can be distributed in a more expeditious manner. This includes both professional and vendor funding. For example, Nevada has a master service agreement for evaluation, public outreach, marketing, and augmented staffing, to name a few. Nevada Medicaid support value based purchasing strategies through Managed Care contracts and encourages innovation in payment and service provision. CCBHC's have quality incentive payments for meeting specific benchmarks on quality measures. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. No technical assistance requested at this time. SAMHSA is interested in whether and how states are using evidence in their purchasing decisions, educating policymakers, or supporting providers to offer high quality services. In addition, SAMHSA is concerned with what additional information is needed by SMHAs and SSAs in their efforts to continue to shape their and other purchasers' decisions regarding M/SUD services. 49 United States Public Health Service Office of the Surgeon General (1999).

The Department of Health and Human Services has Grants Management and contracts units that both assist with quality assurance of program and fiscal monitoring. Program analysts provide monthly provider monitoring and scope of work review with providers and again during requests for reimbursement. During this time it is identified if a provider is spending down funds appropriately and adequately. Other internal controls include certification of providers per NAC 458 and a management analyst that completes desk and physical monitors which includes fiscal and program monitoring.

Program Integrity - Required Narrative Question SAMHSA has placed a strong emphasis on ensuring that block grant funds are expended in a manner consistent with the statutory and regulatory framework. This requires that SAMHSA and the states have a strong approach to assuring program integrity. Currently, the primary goals of SAMHSA program integrity efforts are to promote the proper expenditure of block grant funds, improve block grant program compliance nationally, and demonstrate the effective use of block grant funds. While some states have indicated an interest in using block grant funds for individual co-pays deductibles and other types of co-insurance for M/SUD services, SAMHSA reminds states of restrictions on the use of block grant funds outlined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 300x-5 and 300x-31, including cash payments to intended recipients of health services and providing financial assistance to any entity other than a public or nonprofit private entity. Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300x-55(g), SAMHSA periodically conducts site visits to MHBG and SABG grantees to evaluate program and fiscal management. States will need to develop specific policies and procedures for assuring compliance with the funding requirements. Since MHBG funds can only be used for authorized services made available to adults with SMI and children with SED and SABG funds can only be used for individuals with or at risk for SUD. SAMHSA guidance on the use of block grant funding for co-pays, deductibles, and premiums can be found at: http://www.samhsa.gov/sites/default/files/grants/guidance-for-block-grant-funds-for-cost-sharing-assistance-for-private-health- insurance.pdf . States are encouraged to review the guidance and request any needed technical assistance to assure the appropriate use of such funds. The MHBG and SABG resources are to be used to support, not supplant, services that will be covered through the private and public insurance. In addition, SAMHSA will work with CMS and states to identify strategies for sharing data, protocols, and information to assist our program integrity efforts. Data collection, analysis, and reporting will help to ensure that MHBG and SABG funds are allocated to support evidence-based, culturally competent programs, substance use disorder prevention, treatment and recovery programs, and activities for adults with SMI and children with SED. States traditionally have employed a variety of strategies to procure and pay for M/SUD services funded by the MHBG and SABG. State systems for procurement, contract management, financial reporting, and audit vary significantly. These strategies may include: (1) appropriately directing complaints and appeals requests to ensure that QHPs and Medicaid programs are including essential health benefits (EHBs) as per the state benchmark plan; (2) ensuring that individuals are aware of the covered M/SUD benefits; (3) ensuring that consumers of M/SUD services have full confidence in the confidentiality of their medical information; and (4) monitoring the use of M/SUD benefits in light of utilization review, medical necessity, etc. Consequently, states may have to become more proactive in ensuring that state-funded providers are enrolled in the Medicaid program and have the ability to determine if clients are enrolled or eligible to enroll in Medicaid. Additionally, compliance review and audit protocols may need to be revised to provide for increased tests of client eligibility and enrollment.

How many consultation sessions has the state conducted with federally recognized tribes? The State of Nevada has a longstanding government-to-government relationship with each of the 28 federally-recognized tribes. The Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) is no exception. DHHS honors the sovereign governments of each the tribes and does not require any of the tribes to waive their sovereign immunity as a condition of receiving state support or grant funds. The DHHS and five divisions (Aging and Disability Services Division, Division of Child and Family Services, Division of Health Care Financing and Policy, Division of Public and Behavioral Health, and Division of Welfare and Supportive Services) have an established and formalized government-to-government relationship with each of the tribes. The Director of DHHS and the division administrators actively engaged in the consultation process. Among other efforts, DHHS hosts quarterly and upon- request roundtable consultations with elected tribal leaders and/or their representatives. This is not less than six consultations per year, which can be more based on the needs of any respective nation. The DHHS Director participates at the annual ITCN conference. As part of the consultation process, DHHS and each of the five divisions have appointed culturally competent tribal liaisons. The tribal liaisons work directly with state and tribal leaders to identify, address, and meet tribal healthcare needs. They also work closely with tribal and Indian Health Services (IHS) clinic directors. To help ensure DHHS provides culturally competent care and services, DHHS has tribal liaison representation at all tribal and IHS clinic directors' meetings. Tribal liaisons also work with non-tribal agencies, such as ITCN, the Nevada Statewide Native American Coalition (Nevada SNAC), the Inter-Tribal Emergency Response Commission (ITERC), the Nevada Indian Commission (NIC), and IHS. Tribal liaisons also routinely promote cultural awareness and competency presentations to DHHS employees, stakeholders, and key partners statewide. Nevada Prevention Coalition have presented to the Nevada Indian Tribal Council addressing events in multiple rural areas of Nevada. Nevada Bureau of Behavioral Health Wellness and Prevention has also been successful in attaining a Tribal representative Environmental Factors and Plan 7. Tribes - Requested Narrative Question The federal government has a unique obligation to help improve the health of American Indians and Alaska Natives through the various health and human services programs administered by HHS. Treaties, federal legislation, regulations, executive orders, and Presidential memoranda support and define the relationship of the federal government with federally recognized tribes, which is derived from the political and legal relationship that Indian tribes have with the federal government and is not based upon race. SAMHSA is required by the 2009 Memorandum on Tribal Consultation56 to submit plans on how it will engage in regular and meaningful consultation and collaboration with tribal officials in the development of federal policies that have tribal implications. Improving the health and well-being of tribal nations is contingent upon understanding their specific needs. Tribal consultation is an essential tool in achieving that understanding. Consultation is an enhanced form of communication, which emphasizes trust, respect, and shared responsibility. It is an open and free exchange of information and opinion among parties, which leads to mutual understanding and comprehension. Consultation is integral to a deliberative process that results in effective collaboration and informed decision-making with the ultimate goal of reaching consensus on issues. In the context of the block grant funds awarded to tribes, SAMHSA views consultation as a government-to-government interaction and should be distinguished from input provided by individual tribal members or services provided for tribal members whether on or off tribal lands. Therefore, the interaction should be attended by elected officials of the tribe or their designees and by the highest possible state officials. As states administer health and human services programs that are supported with federal funding, it is imperative that they consult with tribes to ensure the programs meet the needs of the tribes in the state. In addition to general stakeholder consultation, states should establish, implement, and document a process for consultation with the federally recognized tribal governments located within or governing tribal lands within their borders to solicit their input during the block grant planning process. Evidence that these actions have been performed by the state should be reflected throughout the state's plan. Additionally, it is important to note that approximately 70 percent of American Indians and Alaska Natives do not live on tribal lands. The SMHAs, SSAs and tribes should collaborate to ensure access and culturally competent care for all American Indians and Alaska Natives in the states. States shall not require any tribe to waive its sovereign immunity in order to receive funds or for services to be provided for tribal members on tribal lands. If a state does not have any federally recognized tribal governments or tribal lands within its borders, the state should make a declarative statement to that effect. 56 https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/Presidential%20Memorandum%20Tribal%20Consultation%20%282009%29.pdf Printed: 9/10/2021 5:59 PM - Nevada Page 1 of 2 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 1 of 2 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 151 of 305to be on the Nevada Evidence-Based Practice Policy and Procedure Active Workgroup, providing rich insight on the gaps and barriers in Indian communities. 2. What specific concerns were raised during the consultation session(s) noted above? 1. The need to consider a State Plan Amendment for Long Term Support Services 2. Ongoing discussion of creating set aside funding from the State under or with SAPTA for tribal prevention programs that give the opportunity to truly implement meaningful prevention activities through Cultural Based Practices. 3. Addressing the growing need of psychiatric and behavioral health needs within our tribal populations and significant lack of resources within this State to address this issue and its impact on the homeless situation, which directly impacts the RSIC facilities, the tribal lands, Tribal businesses such as the Walmart location, and homelessness amongst the AIAN populations in need 4. Ongoing discussion on the transition into Tribal FQHC, moreover the plans for reinvesting the State savings back into tribal communities and/or programs specifically addressing the disproportionate health disparities and substance use issues amongst the populations 5. Working on collaborative 1115 Demonstration Waivers to address the needs in tribal communities, while being creative in the approach as budget neutral initiatives 6. Remote Pharmacy initiatives to address the needs of rural communities with innovative opportunities to expand access to services by utilizing technology based systems for our pharmacies 7. Youth Residential Treatment Billing allowances, YRTC's that offer residential treatment for AIAN youth should be able to bill at the AIR rate. 8. A Foster Care Assistance and Certification process that better supports the significant need for foster parent opportunities in tribal communities 9. Community Health Assistant Program (CHAP), Dental Health Assistant Therapy (DHAT), Behavioral Health Assistant Therapy (BHAT) models that allow the expansion of midlevel healthcare workers, more broad scope of work for expanding access to care within our tribal Communities. The need to consider models that help to support access to care issues within rural/urban Indian areas and allow greater opportunities for the Tribal Healthcare Delivery Systems to truly sustain costs in providing such care 10. Covid-19 has shown the significant deficiencies in having necessary epidemiology resources to assist in tracking, forecasting, and preparing for the impact of the pandemic overall. The DPBH Tribal Liaison also states, the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed to OPHIE that there is a considerable gap in tribal data. This lack of data makes it difficult to accurately represent the tribal nations in county and statewide reporting. Nevada is working to bridge the gap in reporting through agreements with one nation at a time. This includes utilizing the prevention coalitions that serve the areas of the sovereign nations. Prevention coalitions are identifying methods to enhance their efforts and to support tribal nations through outreach and engagement that is culturally relevant particularly with the youth and adolescents. 3. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? The State of Nevada worked to provide community crisis counselors as part of the FEMA/SAMHSA community crisis grant to provide services to tribal communities during COVID. The crisis counselors were called resilience ambassadors and provide suicide training, suicide prevention activities, as well as direct interface with the tribal populations. For those tribes that allowed information to be provided to the health district, those that tested positive for COVID received outreach calls for preventative measures using holistic and strength-based approaches to build resilience. This also worked to support resource referral and reduce stigma with needed support with SUD/CO. The Office of Suicide Prevention has a strong relationship with tribes throughout Nevada and continues to provide on-site and off-site consultation, training, healing circles, and resources to reduce suicide risk and recover with postvention. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. No technical assistance requested at this time.

Primary Prevention - Required SABG Narrative Question SABG statute requires states to spend not less than 20 percent of their SABG allotment on primary prevention strategies directed at individuals not identified to be in need of treatment. While primary prevention set-aside funds must be used to fund strategies that have a positive impact on the prevention of substance use, it is important to note that many evidence-based substance use disorder prevention strategies also have a positive impact on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental health. The SABG statute requires states to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and services provided in a variety of settings. The program must target both the general population and sub-groups that are at high risk for substance misuse. The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: 1.Information Dissemination providing awareness and knowledge of the nature, extent, and effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, abuse, and addiction on individuals families and communities; 2.Education aimed at affecting critical life and social skills, such as decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis, and systematic judgment abilities; 3.Alternative programs that provide for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; 4.Problem Identification and referral that aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age inappropriate use of tobacco or alcohol, and those individuals who have indulged in first use of illicit drugs, in order to assess if the behavior can be reversed by education to prevent further use; 5.Community-based Process that include organizing, planning, and enhancing effectiveness of program, policy, and practice implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking; and 6.Environmental Strategies that establish or change written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population. In implementing the comprehensive primary prevention program, states should use a variety of strategies that target populations with different levels of risk, including the IOM classified universal, selective, and indicated strategies.

Does your state use needs assesment data to make decisions about the allocation SABG primary prevention funds? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No If yes, (please explain) The State of Nevada is required to utilize needs assessments and gap analysis to identify priority funding. This includes working with Regional Behavioral Health Coordinator who support the review of the information at behavioral health boards and includes input from each community of focus as well as prevention coalition partners. In addition, the State utilizes the Office of Minority Health and Equity which produces information on health and behavioral health disparities. Data collected from the needs assessment drive decisions regarding areas of SU/CO focus, targeted geographical areas and gaps in services to specific populations of focus. This also works to support the development of programs in rural/frontier, minotiry- majority, and economically underserved communities. The state collects both qualitative and quantitative data from the sources identified above as well as through the State Office of Rural Health and University Health systems. In addition, each prevention coalition creates a Community Coalition Prevention Plan (CCPP) which is updated not less than every-three years. This allows the prevention coalitions to contribute by identifying the community-based need, set priorities, and allot their fiscal resources to address those needs. SAPTA recently conducted a situational analysis and strategic plan to assist in developing key strategies over the next five years. As reports are updated related to behavioral health, SAPTA reviews the data, trends results and works to utilize it in planning. Nevada also utilizes State Medicaid and MCO data, results of the various state surveys, data from billing codes, and any other sources available throughout the State which provides insight into the issues impacting Nevadans. These plans include the three consortium plans, and individual agency plans within the Division of Public and Behavioral Health which all utilize consumer input and stakeholder feedback prior to being published. Nevada includes coalitions representing all counties that utilize the strategic prevention framework and are highly trained in that model. The coalition structure is such that there is representation from a minimal of 12 sectors of participants in each community, and all communities are represented in a lead from the middle framework which helps partners feel they are a part of the whole process. This avoids a top down approach, or a bottom up approach but a true partnership between the communities and the State. Coalitions provide sub grants to various community partners through a competitive process to ensure the prevention priorities are implemented well and that the experts from the proper sectors are utilized. For example, if a media campaign is needed then they partner with a local or national media company that meets the needs identified and in compliance with the funding allocation.

Does your state have a statewide licensing or certification program for the substance use disorder prevention workforce? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No If yes, please describe Our State requires certification for funding, and funding they must have one prevention specialist. The state encourages all prevention providers to have more than one staff member certified in prevention. This certification started in 2016. Many of the providers sought national prevention certifications previously. 2. Does your state have a formal mechanism to provide training and technical assistance to the substance use disorder prevention workforce? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No If yes, please describe mechanism used ur State has ongoing communication with providers through monthly provider calls, and a state liaison to the providers that can be contacted for technical assistance needs. When training needs are identified the State works with providers to try and find solutions, and at times hosts collaborative training's for state staff and community prevention partners. Attempts are made whenever possible to communicate trainings that are being held that will be mutually beneficial and can serve the needs of all who participate in the field. Also, the coalitions provide information to the State regarding training's they are holding and invite state staff to participate when appropriate. SAPTA has relied on the CAPT West RET along with the Center for the Application of Substance Abuse Technologies (CASAT) and Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) to provide training and technical assistance to SAPTA staff as well as all of the state's prevention workforce. All of these entities offer live trainings, webinars, and conferences. SAPTA makes every effort to notify prevention and treatment providers of any pertinent training opportunities of which it becomes aware. A top priority for SAPTA is the continuous education on substance abuse prevention. In support of this priority, the Center for Application of Substance Abuse Technologies (CASAT) offers workshops and trainings on substance abuse for prevention professionals, Coalitions and, in its advisory capacity the SEW, MPAC, and the SAPTA Advisory Board, meet and offer recommendations on the types of trainings needed to further SAPTA's goals and objectives. This supports the updating of the partners with evidence-based practices and the workforce trends in substance abuse. CASAT offers many training sessions during each year. In addition, the Nevada Prevention Resource Center (NPRC - CASAT Clearinghouse) will serve as an information clearinghouse to SAPTA and the 12 community coalitions. The Crisis Call Center will provide training and continuing education to those taking calls regarding substance abuse issues through the Nevada 211 system, as part as information and crisis management. The Nevada Statewide Partnership, which is the \"coalition of coalitions\" made up of the Executive Directors of the 12 funded coalitions, will also offer training sessions to coalition staff and board members. Nevada will create a competency-based statewide training designed to increase professional and volunteer ability to impact community substance and abuse and related risk and protective factor. 3.

If yes, please describe mechanism used Our State has a request for qualification application. In the application are agency capacity questions including policies and procedures for managing funds properly, maintaining the proper staffing ratios needed to manage projects, and demonstrating an understanding of the federal rules and regulations. There have been times in the past where agencies struggled to maintain the proper capacity to perform duties of the grants and requirements of the projects and have closed their doors. This typically happened after many supportive interactions with the State providing technical assistance as well as peers providing supportive services. Most State partners are willing to mentor other providers as needed to help them be successful as Nevada struggles with keeping professionals of all backgrounds in the workforce. Most of the twelve coalitions have served their community for many years and have a keen sense of their community's challenges. During the economic downturn, several of the rural and frontier communities were greatly affected. Unemployment in some counties was as high as 20%, and the ability to buy food for families was on the decline. In response to this turn of events, several of the coalitions applied for grants from other sources such as the FDA in an effort to expand their reach and available resources. Because of the leadership of these coalitions, food banks and thrift stores were created. Some of the communities experienced an increase in mental health and crime related issues. The Coalitions began to broaden their membership to include businesses, schools, law enforcement, physicians, and dentists to assist their underserved. In addition, some coalitions have now expanded through other grant resources to include assisting with mental health capacity building and have increased their partnerships with the schools to build referral systems and decrease mental health stigma. This broadened approach allows for a coordinated, focused, intentional response to community challenges. With the funding and technical assistance from the Bureau of Behavioral Health Wellness and Prevention the coalitions will continue to grow their organizations. The issue of workforce development has been a challenge for the Bureau for many years. Workforce development is a topic of concern from every state agency and community agency that provides care. One of the goals in the Bureau's Strategic Plan is to engage with educational partners including higher education and secondary education partners to create a pipeline of qualified workforce to address community needs. Building capacity in the workforce is mentioned in most strategic meetings across the state and is being addressed on a continual basis until there is no longer a shortage in professionals. With Nevada's growing population and increased need, based on population growth it is unlikely the need will go away soon.

Please list the specific primary prevention programs, practices, and strategies that are funded with SABG primary prevention dollars in each of the six prevention strategies. Please see the introduction above for definitions of the six strategies: a) Information Dissemination: Health Fairs-Nevada's rural and frontier regions rely on these types of community gatherings to get the word out about substance abuse and underage drinking. Printed Material-When coalitions make presentations to parents, bartenders, or students, often they take home printed materials with information and phone numbers or referrals for future reference. PSA Development- PSA's are a part of coalitions regular operation. Many new PSA's are being developed to address marijuana use and build traffic to sites like knowmj.org where people can learn more about marijuana, and coalition prevention work including the harmful effects of various substances. Other uses are when coalitions want to announce their events to draw community members to attend. Speaking Engagements Email requests- Because the coalitions have a long history of serving their communities, they are often called upon to make presentations to the public or speak at conferences and events about strategies and the latest trends in use and prevention efforts. Coalitions are frequently called upon to provide information to legislative bodies who use the information to make informed decisions about issues facing their community. Social Media Dissemination- All of the coalitions have websites and most have Facebook pages or Twitter accounts. These social media outlets help to attract youth to their activities and mission. This is also true for the State partners including Maternal and Child Health which promotes the website sobermomshealthybabies.org, and the Department of Narratve Question SABG statute requires states to spend not less than 20 percent of their SABG allotment on primary prevention strategies directed at individuals not identified to be in need of treatment. While primary prevention set-aside funds must be used to fund strategies that have a positive impact on the prevention of substance use, it is important to note that many evidence-based substance use disorder prevention strategies also have a positive impact on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental health. The SABG statute requires states to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and services provided in a variety of settings. The program must target both the general population and sub-groups that are at high risk for substance misuse. The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: 1.Information Dissemination providing awareness and knowledge of the nature, extent, and effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, abuse, and addiction on individuals families and communities; 2.Education aimed at affecting critical life and social skills, such as decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis, and systematic judgment abilities; 3.Alternative programs that provide for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; 4.Problem Identification and referral that aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age inappropriate use of tobacco or alcohol, and those individuals who have indulged in first use of illicit drugs, in order to assess if the behavior can be reversed by education to prevent further use; 5.Community-based Process that include organizing, planning, and enhancing effectiveness of program, policy, and practice implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking; and 6.Environmental Strategies that establish or change written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population. In implementing the comprehensive primary prevention program, states should use a variety of strategies that target populations with different levels of risk, including the IOM classified universal, selective, and indicated strategies.

Many coalitions engage youth to conduct peer-to-peer educational presentations. Education to parents-Coalition staff or guest speakers from the community present to parents at high schools. In this way, parents are engaged in the prevention process and can reinforce and support information youth are receiving regarding substance use and abuse. Education and information to medical providers- Multiple resources are available to help providers do a better job at detecting and making referrals to the proper places. Prevention partners come together to ensure resources are shared and utilized by providers. Education to Treatment and Prevention providers on addiction- In an effort to assist prevention and treatment providers with information to hone their skills or keeping abreast of current trends. Education to bartenders and servers on the importance of carding their customers before serving them alcohol to reduce underage drinking. Additional focus is placed on responsible beverage service to address binge-drinking and other hazards such as alcohol poisoning. Education to tobacco sales merchants about carding customers before selling. Education to Marijuana dispensaries about the laws associated with sales. Focus is also placed on harm to minors, and assistance given to help avoid access to minors. c) Alternatives: Recovery picnic which is held every September in northern Nevada in an effort to normalize the decision to be drug-free and support those in recovery. Safe and Sober graduation parties are held in many of Nevada's high schools. Block grant funds are often combined with the Safe and Sober organizations throughout the state to offer a safe, drug-free graduation experience. Block Grant funds are utilized to form and support youth prevention clubs in middle and high schools across the state. These groups offer youth a safe, constructive and meaningful way to spend their time. d) Problem Identification and Referral: Most of the coalitions in the state fund direct service programs that address high risk youth (incarcerated, on probation, or whose parents are incarcerated). In some of the counties, Signs of Suicide (SOS) is being conducted as well as Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) and Youth Mental Health First Aid (YMHFA) where there are increases in number of referrals to services taking place across the State, and an annual increase in trainers who help communities know signs and symptoms and make referrals to triage centers to get people the proper help. Some communities are mapping out their resources and deliberately creating a formalized triage process that all community partners can follow giving it a no wrong door approach. Military- Brochure: Binge Drinking/High-Intensity Drinking e) Community-Based Processes: . This is the most powerful strategy used in Nevada and it begins within the twelve community coalitions. Attending the coalition meetings, one sees members of the community from all walks of life and business including the 12 sectors from the SPF SIG model. Included, but not limited to, are food banks, domestic violence agencies, law enforcement, farmers, ranchers, health care providers of mental health as well as medicine, tribal entities, government agencies, schools, students, youth, parents, and clergy all working together to improve their community. Again, with the various sectors working together and seeking to solve problems as a group rather than in silo's they are able to close the service gaps more efficiently. The Statewide partnership and a select few coalitions are tasked with mentoring new and existing coalitions to improve their practices, and build capacity to serve their perspective communities better which includes sharing experiences, managing grants, building lasting relationships with community members, understanding reporting, evaluation, community outreach techniques and following proper state processes. f) Environmental: Service and Actions oriented Initiatives: RX Round-ups which are held semi-annually. These events highlight the issue of availability to youth of prescription medication for non-medical purposes, as well as bring awareness to misuse/abuse of these medications. Block Grant funds are utilized to form and support youth prevention clubs in middle and high schools across the state. These groups are working towards shifting social norms regarding drug use among youth. Media campaigns which focus: o On the need to limit the over-prescribing of opioids o Locking up prescriptions from youth o Dangers of second hand smoke especially around children o Governor's campaign to improve birth outcomes o Substance use including Marijuana, alcohol, and Opioids. Legal and regulatory initiatives: Quarterly compliance checks especially during Reno's Pub Crawls. These checks spread the word that the community will not tolerate underage drinking and/or misuse of alcohol.

Does your state have a process in place to ensure that SABG dollars are used only to fund primary prevention services not funded through other means? nmlkji Yes nmlkj No If yes, please describe Our state has a no supplanting requirement in place for all sub recipients. While integrating the need is encouraged for sustainability purposes it is to be done within the proper parameters that avoid duplication of efforts or supplanting. There are two federal substance abuse-related grants DPBH oversees (Block, and PFS) and two state grants awarded to the prevention coalitions, and monitored by SAPTA. Each funding source has its priorities, thus complimenting or enhancing the other funding streams. The Coalitions report on each grant's quarterly activities separately, to maintain separate scopes of work and avoid any supplanting of funds. Additionally, a monitor is conducted annually to include a fiscal review to ensure all sources are accounted for separately as well as whether each is complying with federal and state regulations.

Please check those outcome measures listed below that your state collects on its SABG funded prevention services: Narratve Question SABG statute requires states to spend not less than 20 percent of their SABG allotment on primary prevention strategies directed at individuals not identified to be in need of treatment. While primary prevention set-aside funds must be used to fund strategies that have a positive impact on the prevention of substance use, it is important to note that many evidence-based substance use disorder prevention strategies also have a positive impact on other health and social outcomes such as education, juvenile justice involvement, violence prevention, and mental health. The SABG statute requires states to develop a comprehensive primary prevention program that includes activities and services provided in a variety of settings. The program must target both the general population and sub-groups that are at high risk for substance misuse. The program must include, but is not limited to, the following strategies: 1.Information Dissemination providing awareness and knowledge of the nature, extent, and effects of alcohol, tobacco, and drug use, abuse, and addiction on individuals families and communities; 2.Education aimed at affecting critical life and social skills, such as decision making, refusal skills, critical analysis, and systematic judgment abilities; 3.Alternative programs that provide for the participation of target populations in activities that exclude alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; 4.Problem Identification and referral that aims at identification of those who have indulged in illegal/age inappropriate use of tobacco or alcohol, and those individuals who have indulged in first use of illicit drugs, in order to assess if the behavior can be reversed by education to prevent further use; 5.Community-based Process that include organizing, planning, and enhancing effectiveness of program, policy, and practice implementation, interagency collaboration, coalition building, and networking; and 6.Environmental Strategies that establish or change written and unwritten community standards, codes, and attitudes, thereby influencing incidence and prevalence of the abuse of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs used in the general population.

The increased emphasis on funding EBPs with PFS and SABG awarded funding is based on directives from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). EBPs offer scientifically tested and validated programs, practices, and policies for implementation among specified or similarly oriented populations or target populations. While there are numerous available EBPs, it is understood that unique community attributes as often found in Nevada based on the population dynamics, distribution, and diversity of the Sil ver State. However, such population considerations should not restrict the utilization of existing EBPs. Fundamentally, there is a funding -based need for Nevada to commit resources and energy to increasing utilization of highly rated EBPs as part of PFS and SABG funded programming and project -based activities. This instructional guide is designed to facilitate the completion of the redesigned EBPPP Proposal Review and Approval Form, which will be required for all proposed EBP or EBP -style projects included in PFS and SABG annual scope of work proposals for funding award. In addition to this instructional guide, an EBPPP Manual has also been developed to summarize the most recently proposed and implemented EBPs from the Nevada PFS and SABG grant awards. Alth ough historically only waiver -based or provisional -waiver projects were required to complete a review and approval form, going forward PFS and SABG proposed EBP or EBP- style projects and programming will be required to complete the EBPPP Proposal Review an d Approval form and provide at least minimal documentation of the EBP being proposed from a Printed: 9/10/2021 5:50 PM - Nevada Page 14 of 116 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 14 of 116 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 166 Form Guidelines Updated March 2021 PX-EBPPPAW - Proposal Guide - 2021 | 2 nationally recognized clearinghouse (refer to the EBPPP Manual for a comprehensive list of current and recent EBPs as well as literature resources associated with each listed EBP or proposed EBP). The goal of this approach is to connect proposals and scopes to actionable evaluation and compliance monitoring related to EBP implementation and administration to ensure PFS and SABG funding is impacting the identified tar get populations from a statewide perspective, a prevention coalition- based perspective, and a specific program -based perspective. The following sections of this instructional guide will provide overall guidance to completing the EBPPP Proposal Review and A pproval Form as well as present specific Question- by-Question guidance and expectations for review and approval process. Guidance to Completing the EBP PP Proposal Review Form: This EBPPP Proposal Review and Approval Form will be completed by prevention coalitions for all proposed projects considered to be EBPs or designed to align with EBP standards. This includes all projects regardless of EBP rating by a nationally recognized clearinghouse. To complete the EBPPP Proposal Review and Approval Form, prevention coalitions should refer to the EBPPP Manual and the provided project specific literature as initial resources for inclusion as supporting documentation. Many of the sections are self - explanatory and will have limited guidance, while other sections have more extensive instructions to support prevention coalitions in the formulation of responses to each of the required questions. Following an initial section of overview and proposal summary information, the form incorporates a series of 12 -questions of which 1 -2 and 7 -12 are required for all projects. The determination for completion of Questions 3 -6 is based on responses to Questions 1 -2, as noted on the EBPPP Proposal and Review Form. Fundamentally, any proposed project that has a response of \"No\" to either Question 1 or Question 2 will be required to complete Questions 3 -6. Projects that meet the requirements of both Question 1 and Question 2 are not required to complete the Supplemental Questions (3 -6).

EBPPP Proposal Coalition Overview The information collected in the EBPPP Proposal Coalition Overview is general identification and background information related to both the program and the prevention coalition. As previously stated, this form will be required to be completed for all proposed EBP or EBP -related projects as part of the scope of work process. As such, there is a possibility that prevention coalitions will complete multiple EBPPP Proposal Review and App roval Forms. It is important that the main point of contact identified is EBP proposal specific so we can reach out directly with questions related to the proposal and planned implementation, administration, and evaluation. For the funding source, please indicate whether the proposed project is PFS, SABG, or both. In the cases where funding from both grant funds is utilized, please provide the applicable budget for PFS and SABG separately. Remember, the required cost information is the proposed project cost, not the overall prevention coalition budget request. EBPPP Proposal Summary The EBPPP Proposal Summary section includes specific content areas and details for each content area as well as a simple \"Yes\" or \"No\" EBPPPAW review to determine if the require ments were met. The content areas included are: Program Name, Target Population, Risk and Protective Factors (Individual, Family, and Community perspectives), Problem Statement, Institute of Medicine (Codes and Categories based on scope of work), and EBP Program Description. The Target Population response should identify any specific target populations for the proposed EBP with notation to the source of data utilized to select the target population. 1 For the Risk and Protective Factors, the initial respons e should include which levels of factors are incorporated into the proposed EBP. 1 Please refer to the EPI Profiles, Disparity Impact Statement, EBPPP Manual and other document ation made available on http://dpbh.nv.gov/Programs/ClinicalSAPTA/dta/Partners/ToolsforProviders/ .

If any of the three levels are not pertinent to the proposed EBP a note should be included to indicate N/A, not applicable, or something similar. The Problem Statement is specifically aligned with the proposed EBP and should provide some connection or alignment with the overall scope of work for the prevention coalition at the broader coalition level. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) section should include listed IOM codes and categories being addressed with proposed programming as aligned with scope of work details and information. Finally, the EBP Program Description field should include a short synopsis of the proposed EBP. EBPPP Proposal Review Information (Q1 -Q2) Questions 1 and 2 are designed to assess proposals from the perspective of EBP ratings of either \"highest rated\" or \"promising/emerging\" rating status from one of the nationally recognized EBP clearinghouses. Information about current or recent EBP related programming from a rating and documentation perspective should be accessed in the EBPPP Manual as noted earlier in this instructional guide. If the program is on a national registry or list as a \"Model\" or highly -rated substance abuse prevention strategy , coalitions need to answer \"Yes\" to Question 1, and provide a link to the documentation (there is a section at the end of the EBPPP Proposal Review and Approval Form for including journal articles and other reporting documentation - the cited article in Q uestion 1 or 2 can be further explored as part of that section of the form or additional articles and/or reports can be added to support modifications made to the listed EBP) , add explanations of any planned or proposed modifications (if any) to be made to the referenced model, list N/A in the response section to Question 2, and proceed to complete Questions 7 -12.

The requirement for prevention coalitions to complete this form for all proposed projects is to assist with the gathering of documentation as w ell as the review, evaluation, and reporting of outcomes from funding awards. A s noted previously, all projects that are not implemented and administered as rated by one of the nationally recognized clearinghouses ( SAMHSA; California Evidence- Based Clearinghouse for Child Welfare (CEBC); PEW Charitable Trusts Results First Initiative and Clearinghouse, Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL); National I nstitute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) ; Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP); CrimeSolutions; youth.gov; and Prevention Technology Transfer Center (PTTC)) with a highest rating will be required to submit at least one journal article or report to support any modification or adaptation made to the rated EBP. The lower t he rating as cited in the EBPPP Manual, the more documentation that will be required. Additionally, more documentation will also be required based on the level of modification or adaptation to the implemented EBP in Nevada as compared to the nationally rated EBP. The EBPPPAW will utilize this form and the knowledge of the ISR Team to review proposed EBPs and make decisions about the approval determination. The outcomes of this process will be utilized during annual evaluation as well as annual monitoring processes to ensure projects are being implemented as proposed and help to measure the impact of the implemented EBP. Completed on an annual basis, this form can be informed by previous submissions, but should not be copied and pasted from year to year with notation of updated content annually to ensure alignment with resources and data such as EPI Profiles, Disparity Impact Statement, Evaluation Plan, Annual Evaluation Report, Annual SPARS Reporting (for PFS) or W ebB GAS (SABG) reporting, and other similar data or reports made available as part of the larger systems change innovation at the system level.

An age -adjusted rate is a rate that has been adjusted, or weighted, to the same age dis tribution as a \"standard\" population. Throughout this report, rates are adjusted to the 1 1 standard age groups of the U.S. population in the year 2000 (Census table P25 -1130). Rates are age -adjusted in order to eliminate any potential confounding effects, or biases, that may be a result of health factors that are associated with specific ages. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) BRFSS is a state -based system of health surveys that collects information on health risk behaviors, preventive he alth practices, chronic health conditions , and use of preventive services . More than 350,000 adults are interviewed each year, making the BRFSS the largest telephone health survey in the world. For many states, the BRFSS is the only available source of tim ely and accurate data on health -related behaviors. The survey consists of a set of federally grant funded core questions and states may include and pay for their own questions in the survey. While the survey 's focus is chronic disease and injury, topics covered by the survey include car safety, obesity, and exercise among many others. Since state -added questions are not asked nationwide, these questions are not comparable. Crude Rates The crude rate is the frequency with which an event or circumstance occurs per unit of population . Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System The Enhanced HIV/AIDS Report System (eHARS) is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) developed application used by Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health for data management, reporting , and analysis. Hospital Billing Data (Emergency Department Encounter and Inpatient Admissions) The hospital billing data provides health billing data for emergency department encounters and inpatient admissions for Nevada's non-federal hospitals. NRS 449.485 mandates all hospitals in Nevada report information as prescribed by the director of the Department of Health and Human Services. The data are collected using a standard universal billing form. The data includes demograp hics such as age, gender, race/ethnicity , and uses International Classification of Diseases -9-Clinical Modification (ICD -9-CM) diagnoses codes and International Classification of Diseases -10-Clinical Modification (ICD -10-CM) diagnoses. ICD -10-CM diagnoses codes replaced ICD -9-CM diagnoses codes in the last quarter of 2015. Therefore, data prior to last quarter in 2015 may not be directly comparable to data thereafter. In addition, the data includes billed hospital charges, procedure codes, discharge status, and external cause of injury codes. The billing information is for billed charges and not the actual payment received by the hospital.

Monitoring the Future Survey Since 1975 Monitoring the Future Survey has measured alcohol and drug use, and re lated attitudes among adolescent students nationwide. Survey participants report their drug use behaviors across three -time periods: lifetime, past year, and past month. Students from both public and private schools participate in the survey. The survey is funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), a component of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and conduct ed by the University of Michigan. Medicaid The Division of Health Care Financing and Policy (DHCFP) data warehouse is comprised of claims data submitted by over 28,000 Medicaid providers from within Nevada and across the country. While DHCFP staff conscie ntiously make every effort to validate these data through continuous provider education and the use of highly experienced audit staff, the Division relies heavily on providers to submit accurate and complete information on Medicaid patients. It should ther efore be understood by the users of DHCFP reports on disease morbidity and patient health that the data source for these reports are based solely on patient claims data and may not be a complete and comprehensive health record.

State administrative data systems, claims, and encounter data are the primary data sources. The state role in submitting TEDS to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is critical, since TEDS is the only national data source for client -level information on persons who use substance use treatment services. TEDS also provide a mechanism for states to report treatment admissions and discharges of persons receiving mental health services. This reporting framework supports SAMHSA's initiative to build a national behavioral health data set accessible (with appropriate confidentiality protection) by the public; local, state, and federal policymakers; researchers; and many others for comparisons and trends on the characteristics of persons receiving substance use and/or mental health treatment services. TE DS provides outcomes data in support of SAMHSA's program, performance measurement, and management goals. United States Census Bureau The United States Census Bureau is responsible for the United States Census , the official decennial (10 - year period) count of people living in the United States of America. Collected data are disseminated through web browser -based tools like the American Community Survey , which provides quick facts on frequently requested data col lected from population estimates, census counts , and surveys of population and housing for the nation, states, counties, and large cities. The Bureau also offers the American Fact Finder, which profiles the American population and economy every five years. Web -Enabled Vital Records Registry Systems (WEVRRS) Statewide births and deaths are collected by the Office of Vital Records, in the Division of Public and Behavioral Health. WEVRRS is a s oftware utilized by physicians, registered nurses, midwives, informants or funeral directors, and other individuals to collect and consolidate birth and death -related information . Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) The purpose of the YRBS is to provide Nevada data to assess trends in priority health -risk b ehaviors among high school students , measure progress toward achieving national health objectives for Healthy People 2020 and other program and policy indicators and evaluate the impact of broad school and community interventions at the national, state, an d local level. The YRBS is a biennial, anonymous, and voluntary survey of students in 9th through 12th grade in traditional, public high schools , and in Nevada charter schools and public middle schools that monitors the prevalence of health risk behaviors among youth. The survey asks students to self -report their behaviors in six major areas of health that directly lead to morbidity and mortality ; these include: (1) Behaviors that contribute to unintent ional injuries and violence; (2) Sexual behaviors that contribute to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, other Printed: 9/10/2021 5:50 PM - Nevada Page 43 of 116 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 43 of 116 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 195 of 305Nevada Behavioral Health EPI Profile Page 5 of 76 sexually transmitted diseases, and unintended pregnancy; ( 3) Tobacco use; (4) Alcohol and other drug use; (5) Unhealthy dietary behavio rs; and (6) Physical inactivity.

The analysis can be used to identify issues of concern and areas that may need to be addressed . The Nevada Bureau of Behavioral Health and Wellness supports 10 community coalitions that pass - through the funding for direct services to providers for prevention. The programs are funded to provide one or more prevention strategies that are promoted by the Center for Substance Abuse Prevention. The strat egies are: information dissemination, prevention education, alternative activities, problem identification and referral, community -based processes, and environmental strategies. This report groups the data by prevention coalition region to provide a more detail analysis of significant findings in the counties the coalition support. Key Findings Mental Health Both female high school and middle school students have significantly higher percent of feeling sad/hopeless, and suicide thoughts including considering, planning and attempting suicide (YRBS ). For e mergency departmen t encounters , anxiety is the leading mental health -related diagnosis . Females have significantly higher visits for anxiety, dep ression, bipolar disorder and PTSD, whereas males are significantly higher encounters for schizophrenia and suicide ideation.

Clark County hard significantly higher emergency department encounters for schizophrenia, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and suicide ideation. For i npatient admissions unlike emergency department encounters, depression is the leading diagnosis for mental health -related inpatient admissions. The Clark County has significantly higher admissions for schizophrenia and suicide ideation, wh ereas CCC and Nye Community Coalition (NCC) county regions have significantly higher admissions from anxiety (Inpatient ). Unduplicated clients served at state-funded mental health clinics ha ve declined sign ificantly since 2011. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) went into effect in 2014. Therefore, many Nevada residents are now able to access non -state -funded facilities through the expansion of Medicaid (AVATAR ). When asked \"Have you seriously considered attempting suicide during the past 12 months, \" 4.8% of Nevada residents responded yes i n 2019, and increase from 3.5% in 2018. ( Suicides ) The PACE county region s have a significantly higher age-adjusted rate for suicide in 201 9 (Suicides ). The Partnership Carson City coalition (PCC) and Join Together Northern Nevada (JTNN) , Healthy Communities Coalition ( HCC), and CCC coalition county regions have significantly higher rates for mental health related deaths (Deaths ). The LGBT community have significantly higher percent of depressive disorder diagnos es and more days of poor mental health (LGBT ).

The PACT/CARE coalition region both in Clark County had significantly lower rate of drug and alcohol dea ths then the remainder of the state ( Deaths ). In roughly 33% of the unintentional or undetermined overdose deaths in 2019 , the deceased had been identified as currently having a mental health problem ( Deaths ). The most common substance listed in cause of death is opioid (type not specified, 57.5% ), followed by methamphetamine (51.4%) [ Deaths ]. Since marijua na has been legalized in 2017, reported marijuana use during pregnancy has more than doubled and has surpassed all other substances (MCH ).

National Survey of Drug Use and Health The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) sponsors the Nation Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The survey tracks trends of illicit drug, alcohol, and tobacco use, as well as mental health issues throughout the United States. Figure 8.

Unlike emergency department encounters, depression is the leading diagnosis for mental health -related inpatient admissions from 2010 -2018, but in 2019 there were more admissions related to anxiety . All the mental health -related diagnosis for hospital inpatient admissions increased significantly from 2010 to 2019. Females inpatient admissions for anxiety , depression , PSTD, and bipolar disorders were significantly higher than males, whereas males have significantly higher admissions for suicid al ideation and schizophrenia. Suicidal ideation also increased from 2009 to 2017 but should be noted that in 2016 inpatient admissions statewide dropped and then increase d in 2017. This may be due to ICD -9-CM conversion to ICD -10-CM or another change in medical billing.

Clients may be counted more than once across years. The number of unique clients served by state-funded mental health facilities continues to decline. There were 1 2,714 clients s erved in 201 9, which has decreased significantly from 2011 (23,55 6). The Affordable Care Act (AC A) went into effect in 2014 . Therefore, many Nevada residents are now able to access non- state -funded facilities through the expansion of Medicai d.

In compliance with federal and state law, it assists community members (parents, educators, researchers, lawmakers , etc.) in locating a wealth of detailed information pertaining to K -12 public education in Nevada. The web site has three categories: \"school and district information,\" \"assessment and accountability\" and \"fiscal and technology.\" When student behavioral health needs are not identified or not provided with the necessary att ention, they are more likely to experience difficulties in school. These include higher rates of suspension, expulsion, dropout, and truancy, as well as lower grades. Nationally, 50% of students age 14 or older who are living with a mental illness drop out of high school. This is the highest dropout rate of any disability group. Figure 66.

Hospital billing use s ICD-CM which is a 7 -digit code verses death where the ICD codes are 4 -digit. In hospital b illing data, the ICD codes are provided in the diagnosis fields, while death data the ICD codes are coded from the literal causes of death provided on the death certificate. In October 2015, ICD -10-CM codes were implemented nationwide. Before October 201 5, ICD -9-CM codes were used for medical billing. Therefore, 2015 data consists of two distinct coding schemes, ICD -9-CM and ICD-10-CM respectively. Due to this change in coding schemes, hospital billing data from October 2015 forward may not be directly co mparable to previous data. The following ICD -CM codes were used to define hospital encounters and admissions: All Diagnosis : Anxiety: 300.0 (9) T71 (10) Drug Use encounters are both Primary Diagnosis and All diagnosis were analyzed: The following ICD -10 codes were used to def ine mortality causes : Suicide -related deaths : X60-X84, Y87.0 (Initial cause of death is suicide). Mental and Behavioral -related deaths : F00 -F09, and F20 -F99 (Initial or contributing cause X40-X44, -S64, X85, of death). *The 2 019 EPI Profile utilized contributing cause of death for drug and alcohol related deaths, this methodology is changed to only the initial cause of death in this report, numbers will have decreased due to this change.

The Division of Public and Behavioral Health, Bureau of Behavioral Health Wellness and Prevention (Bureau) policy requires funded substance use treatment providers to report to the Bureau within one day when any level of service to admit individuals to the program reaches 90% capacity or greater. Although per 45 CFR [\u00a7 96.126 (a)], the requirement to report exceeding the 90% capacity to the State is seven days for programs that receive block grant funds and treat persons who inject drugs, the Bureau is requiring this reporting within one-day for all substance use services to better serve the public and expedite access to services for those in need, including pregnant women seeking substance use services per 45 CFR \u00a7 96.131 (c). For PWID provider must: a. Provide immediate services, and if unable to do so, the provider must contact the Bureau immediately to notify the Bureau of the need for client placement. If available resources are known, the provider may refer the client to an alternate provider but must also contact the program officer assigned by the Bureau for the program. The Bureau works to ensure that appropriate referrals are made, and the client obtains needed services, including interim services as defined in [\u00a7 96.121 (4)]. b. If the Bureau determines that no treatment facility has the capacity to admit the woman, the Bureau may authorize the woman to be placed on a wait list and will work with appropriate providers to make available interim services, including a referral for prenatal care, available to the woman not later than 48 hours after the woman seeks the treatment services. The woman must receive priority admission as soon as capacity becomes available. c. If the woman is placed on a wait list, the provider must maintain a mechanism to effectively track, maintain contact with, and report on any individual awaiting admission to treatment in accord with 45 CFR \u00a7 96.126(f).

Individuals with SUD are at an increased risk of exposure to airborne communicable TB disease and subsequent infection with tuberculosis due to congregate situations. Additionally, individuals with SUD are at greater risk for progression of the TB infection into TB disease, associated with weakened immune systems and/or recent TB bacteria infection (individuals with recent with tuberculosis, infection less than two years, are at greatest risk for progression to disease condition). Currently, the DPBH TB SAPT program delivers the necessary TB screening and testing to individuals entering into congregate inpatient SUD treatment facilities. Nevada reviews the activities below for compliance: The activities performed by the subrecipients, as established through the approved Scope of Work within the subawards, are to upon admission to the facility provide the clients with the following: TB screening (signs and symptoms); TB testing using TB blood test (preferred) or TB skin test (2-step procedure); Education about TB disease transmission, disease process, and treatment for TB disease and TB infection; Direct treatment for identified TB infection or referral for treatment of TB infection; Immediate referral to the local health authority TB program for TB disease report, treatment, and case management if active TB disease is suspected. Additionally, the subrecipients may utilize subaward funds to: Conduct TB screening, testing, and education for individuals with substance use disorders not associated with an inpatient SAPT certified facility, as the funding and resources permit; Demonstrate the competency of the subrecipient staff associated with TB screening, testing, and education and participate in ongoing human resource development; Provide outreach activities of training and education to the staff of the SAPT certified facilities and other agencies serving individuals with substance use disorders (SUD).

Please provide an estimate of the number of block grant sub-recipients identified to undergo such a review during the fiscal year(s) involved. One funded provider is randomly selected from each of the three regions, North/South/Rural. An orientation is conducted with the three providers and the Peer Reviewers to discuss the process and expectations both as a Peer Reviewer and as an agency being reviewed. A Peer Review is conducted by peers from other SAPTA funded agencies. The Center for Application of Substance Use Technology (CASAT) as part of the University of Nevada, Reno and NBHA manage the process by providing orientation, scheduling and support. All reviewers are required to sign a confidentiality statement based on 42 CFR Part 2. The review takes approximately 3-5 hours, which depends on the size of the agency. The review is intended to gain a sense of how the program has incorporated the NIDA 13 Principles and other Evidence-based Practices commonly utilized in the substance use and co-occurring disorder field. Recommendations for enhancement, training or technical assistance will be noted in the final report. Materials to be reviewed include, but are not limited to: policy and procedures manual, organizational chart, personnel records, clinical records, and a visual observation of the overall operations. Each year, three SAPTA funded agencies from the list will participate in the process for a total of three Peer Reviews annually. All agencies will have a peer review conducted through the process.

Quality Improvement Plan- Requested Narrative Question In previous block grant applications, SAMHSA asked states to base their administrative operations and service delivery on principles of Continuous Quality Improvement/Total Quality Management (CQI/TQM). These CQI processes should identify and track critical outcomes and performance measures, based on valid and reliable data, consistent with the NBHQF, which will describe the health and functioning of the mental health and addiction systems. The CQI processes should continuously measure the effectiveness of services and supports and ensure that they continue to reflect this evidence of effectiveness. The state's CQI process should also track programmatic improvements using stakeholder input, including the general population and individuals in treatment and recovery and their families. In addition, the CQI plan should include a description of the process for responding to emergencies, critical incidents, complaints, and grievances.

Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics provide trauma informed care to individual regardless of ability to pay. For Youth: The Mobile Crisis Response Team (MCRT) was created to provide crisis intervention and support to Nevada families dealing with a behavioral or mental health crisis. Environmental Factors and Plan 12. Trauma - Requested Narrative Question Trauma 57 is a widespread, harmful, and costly public health problem. It occurs because of violence, abuse, neglect, loss, disaster, war and other emotionally harmful and/or life threatening experiences. Trauma has no boundaries with regard to age, gender, socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, geography, or sexual orientation. It is an almost universal experience of people with mental and substance use difficulties. The need to address trauma is increasingly viewed as an important component of effective M/SUD service delivery. Additionally, it has become evident that addressing trauma requires a multi-pronged, multi-agency public health approach inclusive of public education and awareness, prevention and early identification, and effective trauma-specific assessment and treatment. To maximize the impact of these efforts, they need to be provided in an organizational or community context that is trauma-informed. Individuals with experiences of trauma are found in multiple service sectors, not just in M/SUD services. People in the juvenile and criminal justice system have high rates of mental illness and substance use disorders and personal histories of trauma. Children and families in the child welfare system similarly experience high rates of trauma and associated M/SUD problems. Many patients in primary, specialty, emergency and rehabilitative health care similarly have significant trauma histories, which has an impact on their health and their responsiveness to health interventions. Schools are now recognizing that the impact of exposure to trauma and violence among their students makes it difficult to learn and meet academic goals. Communities and neighborhoods experience trauma and violence. For some these are rare events and for others these are daily events that children and families are forced to live with. These children and families remain especially vulnerable to trauma- related problems, often are in resource poor areas, and rarely seek or receive M/SUD care. States should work with these communities to identify interventions that best meet the needs of these residents. In addition, the public institutions and service systems that are intended to provide services and supports for individuals are often re- traumatizing, making it necessary to rethink doing ?business as usual.? These public institutions and service settings are increasingly adopting a trauma-informed approach. A trauma-informed approach is distinct from trauma-specific assessments and treatments. Rather, trauma- informed refers to creating an organizational culture or climate that realizes the widespread impact of trauma, recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients and staff, responds by integrating knowledge about trauma into policies and procedures, and seeks to actively resist re-traumatizing clients and staff. This approach is guided by key principles that promote safety, trustworthiness and transparency, peer support, empowerment, collaboration, and sensitivity to cultural and gender issues. A trauma-informed approach may incorporate trauma- specific screening, assessment, treatment, and recovery practices or refer individuals to these appropriate services. It is suggested that states refer to SAMHSA's guidance for implementing the trauma-informed approach discussed in the Concept of Trauma58 paper. 57 Definition of Trauma: Individual trauma results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being. 58 Ibid Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 1 of 2 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 280 of 305SAPTA is a strong advocate of prevention, early intervention, treatment and referral in order to have a coordinated system of care. Nevada has been able to initiate and implement the Nevada Resilience Project (NRP) to produce highly trained paraprofessionals who are trained in crisis management; but understand community resources that are needed for individuals in crisis. To date, the NRP has provided services to over 100,000 Nevadans on one-year. In addition, the NRP provided training. In one year, over 1000 community individuals have been able to participate in psychological first aid.

Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? Nevada has launched several programs to support criminal and juvenile justice deflection and diversion programs for adults and youth who have behavioral health treatment needs. Nevada's youth mobile crisis teams (MCRT) reduce the need for law enforcement involvement when a child or youth is struggling with a behavioral health crisis. In addition, Clark County has developed the Harbor program for youth who need to be connected to care and resources and divert from Juvenile Justice involvement. Similarly, programs such as the Law Enforcement Intervention for Mental Health and Addiction (LIMA) program in Clark County works on justice diversion. The LIMA program is a partnership with the Metropolitan Police Department, the Eighth Judicial District Court and Nevada's Departmentof Health and Human Services to provide a nine to 12 month pre-booking diversion program developed to address low-level drug crimes. They have recently implemented law enforcement teams who provide outreach to homeless adults and offer diversion into care for individuals who have mental health and substance use treatment needs. Through the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services, individuals who are incarcerated can now be connected to eligibility workers to support obtaining benefits such as Medicaid and SNAP. These benefits, in addition to discharge planning to care, support individuals transition into the community from incarceration, The SAPTA and Mental Health team are working collaboratively with Clark County Justice system to blend the crisis now program to those returning citizens Environmental Factors and Plan 13. Criminal and Juvenile Justice - Requested Narrative Question More than half of all prison and jail inmates meet criteria for having mental health problems, six in ten meet criteria for a substance use problem, and more than one-third meet criteria for having co-occurring mental and substance use problems. Youth in the juvenile justice system often display a variety of high-risk characteristics that include inadequate family support, school failure, negative peer associations, and insufficient use of community-based services. Most adjudicated youth released from secure detention do not have community follow-up or supervision; therefore, risk factors remain unaddressed.59 Successful diversion of adults and youth from incarceration or re-entering the community from detention is often dependent on engaging in appropriate M/SUD treatment. Some states have implemented such efforts as mental health, veteran and drug courts, Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) and re-entry programs to help reduce arrests, imprisonment and recidivism.60 A diversion program places youth in an alternative program, rather than processing them in the juvenile justice system. States should place an emphasis on screening, assessment, and services provided prior to adjudication and/or sentencing to divert persons with M/SUD from correctional settings. States should also examine specific barriers such as a lack of identification needed for enrollment Medicaid and/or the Health Insurance Marketplace; loss of eligibility for Medicaid resulting from incarceration; and care coordination for individuals with chronic health conditions, housing instability, and employment challenges. Secure custody rates decline when community agencies are present to advocate for alternatives to detention. The MHBG and SABG may be especially valuable in supporting care coordination to promote pre-adjudication or pre-sentencing diversion, providing care during gaps in enrollment after incarceration, and supporting other efforts related to enrollment. 59 Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency: : Identifying High-Risk Youth: Prevalence and Patterns of Adolescent Drug Victims, Judges, and Juvenile Court Reform Through Restorative Justice.

Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? The State of Nevada Passed Legislation specific to the distribution and administration of naloxone. (NRS 453C.100 Authorization to prescribe, dispense and administer opioid antagonist; immunity from liability and professional discipline.) The legislation outlines the following: A pharmacist may, with or without a prescription, furnish naloxone A physician may prescribe and dispense naloxone to the person at risk, their family member, friend, or other person in a position to assist Environmental Factors and Plan 14. Medication Assisted Treatment - Requested (SABG only) Narrative Question There is a voluminous literature on the efficacy of medication-assisted treatment (MAT); the use of FDA approved medication; counseling; behavioral therapy; and social support services, in the treatment of substance use disorders. However, many treatment programs in the U.S. offer only abstinence-based treatment for these conditions. The evidence base for MAT for SUDs is described in SAMHSA TIPs 40[1], 43[2], 45[3], 49 [4], and 63[5]. SAMHSA strongly encourages that the states require treatment facilities providing clinical care to those with substance use disorders demonstrate that they both have the capacity and staff expertise to use MAT or have collaborative relationships with other providers that can provide the appropriate MAT services clinically needed. Individuals with substance use disorders who have a disorder for which there is an FDA-approved medication treatment should have access to those treatments based upon each individual patient's needs. In addition, SAMHSA also encourages states to require the use of MAT for substance use disorders for opioid use, alcohol use, and tobacco use disorders where clinically appropriate. SAMHSA is asking for input from states to inform SAMHSA's activities.

They provided materials to 1,586 physicians in 361 physician offices in 12 of 17 counties. In August 2017, all Data 2000 waivered prescribers were sent a survey surrounding their prescribing of buprenorphine. Among waivered prescribers who responded (39%), none were prescribing at capacity. Providers indicated reasons for not prescribing at capacity and what would increase their willingness to prescribe at capacity. One of the top reported reasons for not prescribing at capacity was insufficient reimbursement rates. This theme also arose in focus groups involving providers conducted in July 2017. Two media campaigns have been running since April 2019. One is targeting stigma reduction and one target naloxone/Good Samaritan Act. The commercials have aired on TV/radio 27,120 times for a return on investment of 11 to 1. SOR implemented prevention education services, including training of healthcare professions on the assessment and treatment of OUD, training of peers and first responders on recognition of opioid overdose and appropriate use of opioid overdose antidote naloxone.

Crisis Services - Required for MHBG Narrative Question In the on-going development of efforts to build an robust system of evidence-based care for persons diagnosed with SMI, SED and SUD and their families via a coordinated continuum of treatments, services and supports, growing attention is being paid across the country to how states and local communities identify and effectively respond to, prevent, manage and help individuals, families, and communities recover from M/SUD crises. SAMHSA has recently released a publication, Crisis Services Effectiveness, Cost Effectiveness and Funding Strategies that states may find helpful.61 SAMHSA has taken a leadership role in deepening the understanding of what it means to be in crisis and how to respond to a crisis experienced by people with M/SUD conditions and their families. According to SAMHSA's publication, Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises62, \"Adults, children, and older adults with an SMI or emotional disorder often lead lives characterized by recurrent, significant crises. These crises are not the inevitable consequences of mental disability, but rather represent the combined impact of a host of additional factors, including lack of access to essential services and supports, poverty, unstable housing, coexisting substance use, other health problems, discrimination, and victimization.\" A crisis response system will have the capacity to prevent, recognize, respond, de-escalate, and follow-up from crises across a continuum, from crisis planning, to early stages of support and respite, to crisis stabilization and intervention, to post-crisis follow-up and support for the individual and their family. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the emerging and growing body of evidence for effective community- based crisis-prevention and response systems. Given the multi-system involvement of many individuals with M/SUD issues, the crisis system approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resources. The following are an array of services and supports used to address crisis response. 61http://store.samhsa.gov/product/Crisis-Services-Effective-Cost-Effectiveness-and-Funding-Strategies/SMA14-4848 62Practice Guidelines: Core Elements for Responding to Mental Health Crises.

Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? Crisis Call Center Hub Assets: The greatest asset in Nevada for Crisis Call Center Hubs is Crisis Support Services of Nevada (CSSNV). It is available to individuals and professional organizations throughout the entire state. CSSNV provides immediate crisis support via numerous technological platforms and can coordinate referrals to other resources and establish connections to other crisis response services, such as Mobile Crisis Teams or Crisis Stabilization Program. In addition to this statewide service, there are also several local crisis lines available in certain regions. For example, Vitality Unlimited in the Rural Region has a locally operated crisis line that contracts with CSSNV for after-hours crisis calls. There are several examples of this in different counties, and having these lines operating at a local level has proven to be beneficial in being able to bring individuals into other services offered by the agencies operating these local crisis lines. Nevada has one of six National Suicide Prevention Lifeline National Call Centers and the crisis line is experiencing great success deploying resources when necessary and otherwise deescalating people in crisis. Mobile Crisis Assets: Similar to the implementation of different crisis call lines, several regions and counties in Nevada have been resourceful in developing different types of mobile outreach units. Various configurations of mobile crisis teams have already been established throughout the state and include law enforcement deflection and diversion programs. There are several examples of units that are connected to hospitals, such as Desert Parkway Behavioral Health in Las Vegas, or law enforcement agencies, such as MOST in Washoe County. These connections between Mobile Crisis Teams and agencies that have the capacity to offer other targeted services can be invaluable to an individual experiencing a crisis. These programs are also facilitating diversion from hospitals and meeting patients where they are at in the community. Children's mobile crisis response is currently being expanded in both northern and southern areas of Nevada through the use of the SAMHSA COVID-19 Emergency Behavioral Health Grant. The close relationship between Mobile Crisis Teams and law enforcement is known to be very effective in de-escalating crisis situations and diverting individuals from held in a jail or emergency department. For the Mobile Crisis Teams that are in place in Nevada, many are utilizing assessment tools, prioritizing safety and security, and providing connections to other resources for the individuals they serve. These resources are implemented by licensed mental health professionals that are staffed as part of the Mobile Crisis Teams that are in place. The clinical understanding and training that these professionals bring to these teams can be very effective in ensuring the safety and security of everyone involved in responding to a crisis. Crisis Stabilization Programs Assets: In more populated areas, there are several options for acute and sub-acute care. In the areas where crisis stabilization programs are easily accessible, there are psychiatric and clinical mental health staff on site to support individuals beyond a crisis. Staff is also provided with adequate training on suicide prevention, trauma-informed care, and safety and security practices for crisis stabilization. These regions also have the infrastructure to support the recommended ratio for the number of beds per 100,000 residents in each area. Community Triage Centers were defined in Nevada Revised Statute in 2005 and provide a different pathway for accessing mental health services, ensuring stabilization within a community setting without first accessing a hospital. These centers were funded creatively, including resources from both state and local sources. Currently, there are three Triage Centers operating in Nevada (two in Las Vegas, and one in Reno). With the additional funding obtained through the SAMHSA COVID-19 Emergency Behavioral Health Grant, two hospitals are expanding to provide this crisis stabilization as an alternative to an emergency department for individuals in crisis (Desert Parkway Behavioral Healthcare Hospital in Las Vegas, and Reno Behavioral Healthcare Hospital in Reno). Crisis Stabilization Programs are intended to provide more than just a bed to individuals, and instead offer a welcoming environment to provide compassionate care that supports an individual both during a crisis and after they return to their community. Nevada is contracting with RI International in order to consult on protocols and standards for mobile crisis teams and stabilization units. They will also be providing a capacity analysis for the state lifeline. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section. No technical assistance requested at this time.

Does the state support recovery through any of the following: Environmental Factors and Plan 16. Recovery - Required Narrative Question The implementation of recovery supports and services are imperative for providing comprehensive, quality M/SUD care. The expansion in access to and coverage for health care compels SAMHSA to promote the availability, quality, and financing of vital services and support systems that facilitate recovery for individuals. Recovery encompasses the spectrum of individual needs related to those with mental disorders and/or substance use disorders. Recovery is supported through the key components of: health (access to quality health and M/SUD treatment); home (housing with needed supports), purpose (education, employment, and other pursuits); and community (peer, family, and other social supports). The principles of recovery guide the approach to person-centered care that is inclusive of shared decision-making. The continuum of care for these conditions includes psychiatric and psychosocial interventions to address acute episodes or recurrence of symptoms associated with an individual's mental or substance use disorder. Because mental and substance use disorders are chronic conditions, systems and services are necessary to facilitate the initiation, stabilization, and management of long-term recovery. SAMHSA has developed the following working definition of recovery from mental and/or substance use disorders: Recovery is a process of change through which individuals improve their health and wellness, live a self-directed life to the greatest extent possible, and strive to reach their full potential. In addition, SAMHSA identified 10 guiding principles of recovery: Recovery emerges from hope; Recovery is person-driven; Recovery occurs via many pathways; Recovery is holistic; Recovery is supported by peers and allies; Recovery is supported through relationship and social networks; Recovery is culturally-based and influenced; Recovery is supported by addressing trauma; Recovery involves individuals, families, community strengths, and responsibility; Recovery is based on respect. Please see SAMHSA's Working Definition of Recovery from Mental Disorders and Substance Use Disorders. States are strongly encouraged to consider ways to incorporate recovery support services, including peer-delivered services, into their continuum of care. Technical assistance and training on a variety of such services are available through the SAMHSA supported Technical Assistance and Training Centers in each region. SAMHSA strongly encourages states to take proactive steps to implement recovery support services. To accomplish this goal and support the wide-scale adoption of recovery supports in the areas of health, home, purpose, and community, SAMHSA has launched Bringing Recovery Supports to Scale Technical Assistance Center Strategy (BRSS TACS). BRSS TACS assists states and others to promote adoption of recovery-oriented supports, services, and systems for people in recovery from substance use and/or mental disorders. Because recovery is based on the involvement of consumers/peers/people in recovery, their family members and caregivers, SMHAs and SSAs can engage these individuals, families, and caregivers in developing recovery-oriented systems and services. States should also support existing and create resources for new consumer, family, and youth networks; recovery community organizations and peer-run organizations; and advocacy organizations to ensure a recovery orientation and expand support networks and recovery services. States are strongly encouraged to engage individuals and families in developing, implementing and monitoring the state M/SUD treatment system.

Provide a description of recovery and recovery support services for adults with SMI and children with SED in your state. Nevada's treatment and recovery framework supports SAMHSA's Theory of Change through an expansion and improvement of policy, both administrative and regulatory, focused on the gaps and needs assessments that turn strategic plans into widely adopted action plans. Nevada has been working towards the innovation and dissemination of policies and has a large support network to implement system of care measures. Working towards a comprehensive system of early mental health identification, the First Episode Pyschosis (FEP) and Early Serious Mental Illness (ESMI) is being implemented in Clark, Carson and Washoe Counties and focuses on the recovery of the individual and their families. In addition, Nevada has identified mobile crisis and no wrong door services as immediate priorities. These support the identification of technical assistance and supports needed at all levels of service delivery. This one-stop model provides immediate support for and provide an intensive system of care individual and family. As part of the recovery and recovery support, Nevada reduces barriers to employment through partner organizations, provides supportive and transitional housing, transportation for health and behavioral health, and care coordination. Recovery support is also done with access to certified community behavioral health clinics, warm lines through NAMI, and recovery group access. In addition, Nevada has been working to expand recovery supports to Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC)s. Through the SOR project Perinatal Toolkits were developed in collaboration with Nevada's ASTHO OMNI stakeholders. The toolkits focus on both inpatient and outpatient perinatal and specifically targets physicians. This toolkit introduces best practices and incorporates Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) into the clinical setting. Also discussed are MAT options for pregnant/postpartum women. 4. Provide a description of recovery and recovery support services for individuals with substance use disorders in your state. The DPBH funds the Center for the Application of Substance Abuse Technologies (CASAT) who provides training regarding peer support services and is working to finalize the certification of peer supportive services. DPBH utilizes peer support to 1) address workforce challenges; and 2) For peer support and service coordinators to support individuals with SMI/SUD who can adapt and provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services towards recovery. The focus is on health, home, purpose and community and works to provide wrap-around services through reducing barriers to employment, increasing supportive housing, transportation for health and behavioral health, and care coordination. This is also done through the expansion of certified community behavioral health clinics, warm lines through NAMI, and recovery group access. The workforce of Peer Recovery Support Specialists is well established across the country and rapidly emerging here in Nevada. Peer Recovery Support Specialists use their lived experience and training to connect people with resources, act as a mentor and model recovery behavior, build relationships, help participants set goals and build recovery plans, advocate for the rights, wellbeing, and recovery of their participants, and encourage resilience and any transitions back to the community. Organizations providing Recovery Support Services must provide services in accordance with principles that support state of change, harm reduction, patient engagement and the use of evidence-based practices. Recovery Support Services are intended to complement, supplement, and extend formal behavioral health services throughout the continuum of care. Through the States SOR grant: A peer led intervention within emergency departments has been established. The peers are in the emergency department 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The certified peers offer in-person peer recovery support to individuals identified to have a primary, secondary, or tertiary opioid and/or stimulant use disorder, adverse drug reaction or overdose. Peers use motivational interviewing techniques to discuss recovery supports, treatment options, harm reduction strategies and provide warm referrals for requested services. 5. Does the state have any activities that it would like to highlight? During the 2021 legislative session, the State of Nevada passed SB69 which encompassed a Peer Support Specialist certification. The legislation includes: Standards for employers, Baselines for education and continual learning requirements for individuals providing peer recovery support services, Standards in ethics and practice, Standards in language and titles (e.g. peer recovery support specialist, certified peer recovery support specialist, recovery coach) Protection for the individual receiving services, the peer providing services and the public.

Community Living and the Implementation of Olmstead - Requested Narrative Question The integration mandate in Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999) , provide legal requirements that are consistent with SAMHSA's mission to reduce the impact of M/SUD on America's communities. Being an active member of a community is an important part of recovery for persons with M/SUD conditions. Title II of the ADA and the regulations promulgated for its enforcement require that states provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate to the individual and prohibit needless institutionalization and segregation in work, living, and other settings. In response to the 10th anniversary of the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision, the Coordinating Council on Community Living was created at HHS. SAMHSA has been a key member of the council and has funded a number of technical assistance opportunities to promote integrated services for people with M/SUD needs, including a policy academy to share effective practices with states. Community living has been a priority across the federal government with recent changes to section 811 and other housing programs operated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). HUD and HHS collaborate to support housing opportunities for persons with disabilities, including persons with behavioral illnesses. The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) cooperate on enforcement and compliance measures. DOJ and OCR have expressed concern about some aspects of state mental health systems including use of traditional institutions and other settings that have institutional characteristics to serve persons whose needs could be better met in community settings. More recently, there has been litigation regarding certain evidenced-based supported employment services such as sheltered workshops. States should ensure block grant funds are allocated to support prevention, treatment, and recovery services in community settings whenever feasible and remain committed, as SAMHSA is, to ensuring services are implemented in accordance with Olmstead and Title II of the ADA. 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Footnotes: Printed: Page 1 of 1 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB No. 0930-0168 Approved: 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 292 of 305Environmental Factors and Plan 18. Children and Adolescents M/SUD Services - Required MHBG, Requested SABG Narrative Question MHBG funds are intended to support programs and activities for children and adolescents with SED, and SABG funds are available for prevention, treatment, and recovery services for youth and young adults with substance use disorders. Each year, an estimated 20 percent of children in the U.S. have a diagnosable mental health condition and one in 10 suffers from a serious emotional disturbance that contributes to substantial impairment in their functioning at home, at school, or in the community.63. Most mental disorders have their roots in childhood, with about 50 percent of affected adults manifesting such disorders by age 14, and 75 percent by age 24.64. For youth between the ages of 10 and 24, suicide is the third leading cause of death and for children between 12 and 17, the second leading cause of death.65. It is also important to note that 11 percent of high school students have a diagnosable substance use disorder involving nicotine, alcohol, or illicit drugs, and nine out of 10 adults who meet clinical criteria for a substance use disorder started smoking, drinking, or using illicit drugs before the age of 18. Of people who started using before the age of 18, one in four will develop an addiction compared to one in twenty-five who started using substances after age 21.66. Mental and substance use disorders in children and adolescents are complex, typically involving multiple challenges. These children and youth are frequently involved in more than one specialized system, including mental health, substance abuse, primary health, education, childcare, child welfare, or juvenile justice. This multi-system involvement often results in fragmented and inadequate care, leaving families overwhelmed and children's needs unmet. For youth and young adults who are transitioning into adult responsibilities, negotiating between the child- and adult-serving systems becomes even harder. To address the need for additional coordination, SAMHSA is encouraging states to designate a point person for children to assist schools in assuring identified children are connected with available mental health and/or substance abuse screening, treatment and recovery support services. Since 1993, SAMHSA has funded the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CMHI) to build the system of care approach in states and communities around the country. This has been an ongoing program with 173 grants awarded to states and communities, and every state has received at least one CMHI grant. Since then SAMHSA has awarded planning and implementation grants to states for adolescent and transition age youth SUD treatment and infrastructure development. This work has included a focus on financing, workforce development and implementing evidence- based treatments. For the past 25 years, the system of care approach has been the major framework for improving delivery systems, services, and outcomes for children, youth, and young adults with mental and/or SUD and co-occurring M/SUD and their families. This approach is comprised of a spectrum of effective, community-based services and supports that are organized into a coordinated network. This approach helps build meaningful partnerships across systems and addresses cultural and linguistic needs while improving the child, youth and young adult functioning in home, school, and community. The system of care approach provides individualized services, is family driven; youth guided and culturally competent; and builds on the strengths of the child, youth or young adult and their family to promote recovery and resilience. Services are delivered in the least restrictive environment possible, use evidence-based practices, and create effective cross-system collaboration including integrated management of service delivery and costs.67. According to data from the 2015 Report to Congress68 on systems of care, services: 1. reach many children and youth typically underserved by the mental health system; 2. improve emotional and behavioral outcomes for children and youth; 3. enhance family outcomes, such as decreased caregiver stress; 4. decrease suicidal ideation and gestures; 5. expand the availability of effective supports and services; and 6. save money by reducing costs in high cost services such as residential settings, inpatient hospitals, and juvenile justice settings. SAMHSA expects that states will build on the well-documented, effective system of care approach to serving children and youth with serious M/SUD needs. Given the multi- system involvement of these children and youth, the system of care approach provides the infrastructure to improve care coordination and outcomes, manage costs, and better invest resources. The array of services and supports in the system of care approach includes: non-residential services (e.g., wraparound service planning, intensive case management, outpatient therapy, intensive home-based services, SUD intensive outpatient services, continuing care, and mobile crisis response); supportive services, (e.g., peer youth support, family peer support, respite services, mental health consultation, and supported education and employment); and Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada Page 1 of 4 Printed: 9/23/2021 11:15 AM - Nevada - OMB 04/19/2019 Expires: 04/30/2022 Page 293 of 305Please respond to the following items: 1.

Describe how the state provide integrated services through the system of care (social services, educational services, child welfare services, juvenile justice services, law enforcement services, substance use disorders, etc.) The State of Nevada's Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS), as part of the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) provides a wide range of services for children, youth and families in Nevada.DCFS program areas include Rural Child Welfare, Youth Parole, as well as Children's Mental Health Services. DCFS also provides severely emotionally disturbed children and youth direct services as well as oversight for the programs administered at the state and county level. In recognizing the important role the State has to protect and provide services to Nevada's vulnerable children, the Governor and Legislature passed and enacted Nevada Revised Statute (NRS) 433B to provide additional provisions related to children. NRS 433B mandates that any county, whose population is 100,000 or more establish a Mental Health Consortia. Nevada's vast geographic area required that a consortia be created in Washoe County (Reno/Tahoe), Clark County (Las Vegas and area), and Rural Nevada (15 of 17 Nevada counties in rural/frontier Nevada). Each consortium is mandated to include partners from the local, county and regional level including school districts, chambers of commerce and business community, state agencies, juvenile probation, community behavioral health care providers, foster care providers, a parent of a child with an emotional disturbance, substance abuse agencies, advocates and provider organizations. DCFS serves as Nevada's Mental Health System of Care (SOC) expert and manages Nevada's Children's Mental Health System of Care Subcommittee as part of the Governor's Wellness and Behavioral Health Council. Nevada is committed to statewide implementation to create sustainable infrastructure and services as part of the Children's Mental Health Initiative (CHMI). The State of Nevada was awarded the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration System of Care- Expansion and Sustainability Grant for youth with Serious Emotional Disorders. This grant residential services (e.g., like therapeutic foster care, crisis stabilization services, and inpatient medical detoxification). 63Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (2013).

Nevada's focus of the SOC expansion and sustainability is to improve mental health outcomes for children and youth (birth to 21 years of age) with serious emotional disturbances (SED) and their families. To ensure integrated services, DPBH - Mental Health, has worked to expand and enhance providers to including not only DCFS who provide mobile crisis services to youth and adolescents, but also to a school-based provider who is also available to provide telehealth services for youth and families. In addition, Nevada expanded psychiatric services to you FQHCs by expanding direct youth services in at-risk communities that have higher populations of child welfare services, justice services, and social services needs. Nevada utilizes the gaps and needs assessments which develop the state plan on behavioral health needs to ensure services are integrated through the full system of care. 7. Does the state have any activities related to this section that you would like to highlight? The State of Nevada's Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS), as part of the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) provides a wide range of services for children, youth and families in Nevada. DCFS's Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health (IECMHS) programs provide evidence-based, relationship-focused mental health treatment to children 0-6 years of age in concert with their caregivers in the Las Vegas and Reno metro areas. The State of Nevada's Medicaid plan includes utilization of the Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood (DC: 0-3)[1] allowing for more accurate diagnostic formulation for children in infancy and early childhood. The most recent CMHI award received by Nevada's System of Care is focused on developing a broad mental health service array throughout Rural/Frontier/Tribal Nevada AND to meet the needs of the targeted population of children 0-6 years and their families. CMHI grant funds for Nevada's System of Care are providing training to support qualified mental health clinicians in rural communities in the evidence-based practice model of Child-Parent Psychotherapy. The DCFS IECMHS program at Northern Nevada Child and Adolescent Services is a primary community stakeholder in the Washoe County Human Service Agency specialty family court program, Zero To Three's Safe Babies Court Team (SBCT). DCFS IECMH clinicians provide Child-Parent Psychotherapy, a mandatory component of the SBCT process. SBCT program began in July of 2019 and the impacts on the well-being of children 0-3 years and their families involved in this program are being evaluated by the team at Zero To Three. To ensure Nevada's children, youth, and families receive individualized and coordinated care, Wraparound In Nevada offers High Fidelity Wrapround or FOCUS. Our partnership with the MHBG has allowed us to decrease time spent waiting for clinical information, meaning our partnerships with families are taking around a week or less to start services. WIN is also implementing clinical support from 2 MHC3's with the MHBG to provide oversight with crisis plans, plans of care, and case consultation. WIN also has staff going through the coaching certification process with NWIC to help support staff practice each model to fidelity. With support and after certification, staff will be able to also provide trainings to new staff and in the community on how to do HFW or FOCUS. Lastly, WIN continues to hire for vacant positions and has increased support through our Administration, Human Resources, and Fiscal departments to ensure that there are no barriers for children, youth, and families to access our services. DCFS also provides Mobile Crisis Response Teams (MCRT) in the Las Vegas and Reno metro areas which account for approximately 89% of Nevada's overall population. DCFS's MCRT coordinates and supports rural/frontier crisis service access with State of Nevada's Division of Public and Behavioral Health's rural MCRT. DCFS's MCRT teams are available in-person or by telehealth 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and 365 days per year. MCRT is a critical element of the system of care for preventing acute and residential placements. MCRT diverts approximately 87% of youth from acute psychiatric hospitalization to community-based services. DCFS's MCRT is considered one of three model MCRT programs nationwide. The MHBG allows DCFS's MCRT to identify and offer intensive in- home services to youth in crisis with the highest multi-system needs (e.g., youth repeatedly using crisis services). The MHBG provides a pathway from acute crisis services to long-term care coordination through Wraparound in Nevada. Additionally, the MHBG allows DCFS to provide intensive in-home services and linkage to Wraparound in Nevada to youth returning from residential placement. Together, the MHBG supports the State of Nevada's response to challenges identified in DOJ investigations. The State of Nevada has implemented the System of Care, to support the effort in establishing and monitoring a system of care for children, youth and young adults, who age out of the foster care programs. This program implements a comprehensive system of care for youth, adolescents and young adults in Nevada. Services (DHHS) provides a wide range of services for children, youth and families in Nevada. The State of Nevada has implemented the System of Care, to support the effort in establishing and monitoring a system of care for children, youth and young adults, who age out of the foster care programs. This program implements a comprehensive system of care for youth, adolescents and young adults in Nevada. Please indicate areas of technical assistance needed related to this section.

Syringe Services (SSP) Narrative Question: The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG) restriction1,2 on the use of federal funds for programs distributing sterile needles or syringes (referred to as syringe services programs (SSP)) was modified by the Consolidated Appropriations Act , 2018 (P.L. 115-141) signed by President Trump on March 23, 20183. Section 520. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, no funds appropriated in this Act shall be used to purchase sterile needles or syringes for the hypodermic injection of any illegal drug: Provided, that such limitation does not apply to the use of funds for elements of a program other than making such purchases if the relevant State or local health department, in consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, determines that the State or local jurisdiction, as applicable, is experiencing, or is at risk for, a significant increase in hepatitis infections or an HIV outbreak due to injection drug use, and such program is operating in accordance with State and local law. A state experiencing, or at risk for, a significant increase in hepatitis infections or an HIV outbreak due to injection drug use, (as determined by CDC), may propose to use SABG to fund elements of an SSP other than to purchase sterile needles or syringes. States interested in directing SABG funds to SSPs must provide the information requested below and receive approval from the State Project Officer. Please note that the term used in the SABG statute and regulation, intravenous drug user (IVDU) is being replaced for the purposes of this discussion by the term now used by the federal government, persons who inject drugs (PWID). States may consider making SABG funds available to either one or more entities to establish elements of a SSP or to establish a relationship with an existing SSP. States should keep in mind the related PWID SABG authorizing legislation and implementing regulation requirements when developing its Plan, specifically, requirements to provide outreach to PWID, SUD treatment and recovery services for PWID, and to routinely collaborate with other healthcare providers, which may include HIV/STD clinics, public health providers, emergency departments, and mental health centers4. SAMHSA funds cannot be supplanted, in other words, used to fund an existing SSP so that state or other non-federal funds can then be used for another program. In the first half of calendar year 2016, the federal government released three guidance documents regarding SSPs5: These documents can be found on the Hiv.gov website: https://www.hiv.gov/federal-response/policies-issues/syringe-services-programs , 1.

Any state or jurisdiction that plans to re-obligate FY 2020-2021 SABG funds previously made available such entities for the purposes of providing substance use disorder treatment services to PWID and outreach to such persons may submit a request via its plan to SAMHSA for the purpose of incorporating elements of a SSP in one or more such entities insofar as the plan request is applicable to the FY 2020-2021 SABG funds only and is consistent with guidance issued by SAMHSA. Section 1931(a(1)(F) of Title XIX, Part B, Subpart II of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act (42 U.S.C.\u00a7 300x-31(a)(1)(F)) and 45 CFR \u00a7 96.135(a) (6) explicitly prohibits the use of SABG funds to provide PWID with hypodermic needles or syringes so that such persons may inject illegal drugs unless the Surgeon General of the United States determines that a demonstration needle exchange program would be effective in reducing injection drug use and the risk of HIV transmission to others. On February 23, 2011, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published a notice in the Federal Register (76 FR 10038) indicating that the Surgeon General of the United States had made a determination that syringe services programs, when part of a comprehensive HIV prevention strategy, play a critical role in preventing HIV among PWID, facilitate entry into SUD treatment and primary care, and do not increase the illicit use of drugs.
