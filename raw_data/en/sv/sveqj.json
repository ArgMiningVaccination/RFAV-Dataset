The Alaska COVID -19 Vaccine Task Force is working with federal, state, Tribal and military partners to plan for Alaska's vaccination needs. Timeline: Vaccine Authorizations and Approvals The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is scheduled to meet on Dec . 10 (Pfizer) and Dec . 17 (Moderna) to publicly discuss the review of the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) applications for these two COVID -19 vaccines. An EUA allows the FDA to make a product available during a declared state of emergency under an expedited review process . First Vaccine Arrival The first shipments of COVID -19 vaccines are expected to arrive in Alaska within the next two weeks. If the FDA authorizes a vaccine, the Alaska COVID -19 Vacci ne Task Force will begin distributing the vaccine to Phase 1A COVID -19 vaccine providers in December and January. Phase 1A is the first group eligible to receive the vaccine and according to national guidelines will include health care personnel and long -term care facility residents and staff. Regular shipments of vaccines are expected to continue throughout 2021. Distributing vaccines across Alaska is a large, coordinated effort and the timeline will change based on input from state, Tribal, federal, milit ary and community partners. According to current federal government estimates, Alaska's initial allocations of vaccines could include: Pfizer: 35,100 doses Moderna: 17,900 doses These vaccine doses will be distributed statewide among public, private and Tribal health systems. Alaska is receiving its state allocation and additional vaccine through the Indian Health Service. The federal government has allocated 11,700 doses of the initial Pfizer shipment for the Alaska Tribal Health System. Distribution methodology will be determined by the Alaska Tribal Health Caucus. Alaska's distribution process will not include military service members, who will be vaccinated separately through a federal allocation. DHSS will provide information about when that vaccine can be expected as soon as it becomes available. Initial Allocation Recommendations On Dec . 1, the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice (ACIP) released recommendations for groups to be vaccinated in the initial phase of the COVID -19 vaccination program. The first phase of vaccination, referred to as Phase 1A by planners, will focus on he alth care personnel serving patients with either confirmed or suspected COVID -19, along with staff and residents of long -term care facilities. On Dec . 3, the Alaska COVID -19 Vaccine Allocation Committee met to review ACIP recommendations. The committee un animously determined a portion of the groups to be included in Phase 1A: hospital - based front -line health care workers at highest risk for COVID -19 infection; long -term care facility residents and staff; EMS and fire personnel providing medical services ; Community Health Aides/Pra ctitioners ; and individuals who are required to perform vaccinations. Alaska's committee plans to meet again Dec . 10 to identify additional groups that would be incorporated in Phase 1 A. Provider Enrollment Providers who have fully enrolled in the COVID -19 Vaccine Progr am will be eligible to receive a portion of the first shipment. As of Dec . 4, 265 health care providers are fully enrolled. Clinics, pharmacies and hospitals are encoura ged to enroll to be included in future distribution planning. The Alaska COVID Vaccine Task Force communicates regularly with enrolled providers to provide updates and technical assistance.
