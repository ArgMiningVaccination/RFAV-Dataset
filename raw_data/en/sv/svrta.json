A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), this program element supports basic medical research at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS). It facilitates the recruitment and retention of faculty; supports unique research training for military medical students and resident fellows; and allows the University's faculty researchers to collect pilot data towards military relevant medical research projects in order to secure research funds from extramural sources (estimated $127 million annually). Approximately 130 intramural research projects are active each year, including 37 faculty start-ups. Projects are funded on a peer-reviewed, competitive basis. Results from these studies contribute to the fund of knowledge intended to enable technical approaches and investment strategies within Defense Science and Technology (S&T) programs. The ILIR program at USUHS is designed to answer fundamental questions of importance to the military medical mission of the Department of Defense in the areas of Infectious Disease, Military Operational Medicine, Combat Casualty Care, and Chemical, Biological, and Radiologic Defense. The portfolio of research projects will vary annually because this research is investigator-initiated. Examples of typical research efforts are detailed in R-2a. Infectious Disease: Immunology and molecular biology of bacterial, viral and parasitic disease threats to military operations. These threats include Bartonella bacilliformis, Clostridium difficile, Medicine: Sustainment of individual performance; mapping and managing deployment and operational stressors; cognitive enhancement; and military and medical training readiness. Combat Casualty Care: Ischemia and reperfusion injury, traumatic brain and peripheral nerve injury, neural control of pain, endotoxic shock, cryotherapy, malignant hyperthermia, inflammation, and wound healing.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Guidance for Development of the Force-Basic Operational Medical Research Sciences: This program element (PE) provides support for basic medical research directed toward greater knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles of science and medicine that are relevant to the improvement of Force Health Protection. Research in this PE is designed to address the following: areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense regarding Wounded Warriors, capabilities identified through the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS), and the strategy and initiatives described in the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). Program development is peer-reviewed and coordinated with all of the Military Services, appropriate Defense Agencies or Activities and other federal agencies, to include the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security. This coordination occurs through the planning and execution activities of the Joint Program Committees (JPCs), established for the Defense Health Program Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding. Research supported by this PE includes polytrauma (multiple traumatic injuries) and blast injury, diagnosis and treatment of brain injury, and psychological health and well-being for military personnel and families. Funds in this PE are for basic research that promises to provide important new approaches to complex military medical problems. As the research efforts mature, the most promising efforts will transition to applied research (PE 0602115HP) or technology development (0603115HP) funding. The FY13 DHP Congressional Special Interest (CSI) funding supported peer-reviewed, directed basic research for Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health projects.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Guidance for Development of the Force - Applied Biomedical Technology: This applied research funding is to refine concepts and ideas into potential solutions to military health and performance problems, with a view towards evaluating technical feasibility. Included are studies and investigations leading to candidate solutions that may involve use of animal models for testing in preparation for initial human testing. Research in this program element is designed to address the following: areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense regarding Wounded Warriors, capabilities identified through the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, and the strategy and initiatives described in the Quadrennial Defense Review. Program development is peer-reviewed and fully coordinated with all Military Services, appropriate Defense Agencies or Activities, and other federal agencies, to include the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Homeland Security. This coordination occurs through the planning and execution activities of the Joint Program Committees (JPCs), established for the Defense Health Program (DHP) Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding. Research supported by this program element includes hemorrhage (bleeding) control, resuscitation and blood products; forward surgical and intensive critical care; en route care; treatments for extremity trauma, tissue injury, cranio-maxillofacial injury (injury to the head, face, jaw, and mouth), lung injury, and burns; rehabilitation; diagnosis and treatment of brain injury; operational health and performance; radiation countermeasures; and psychological health and well-being for military personnel and families. Applied research in military infectious diseases focuses on wound infection prevention, antimicrobial countermeasures and diagnostic systems for infectious diseases. As research efforts mature, the most promising efforts will transition to technology development (PE 0603115HP) or advanced concept development (PE 0604110HP) funding. For the Army Medical Command, beginning in FY14, the military HIV research program funding is transferred from the Army to the Defense Health Program.

Because of the CSI annual structure, out-year funding is not programmed. For the Air Force, this PE funds applied research which seeks to promote 'omic'-informed personalized medicine with an emphasis on targeted prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The delivery of pro-active, evidence-based, personalized medicine will improve health in Warfighters and beneficiaries by providing care that is specific to the situation and patient, to include preventing disease or injury, early and accurate diagnosis, and selection of appropriate and effective treatment. Personalized medicine will reduce morbidity, mortality, mission impact of illness/injury, and healthcare costs while increasing health and wellness of the AF population and efficiency of the healthcare system. This applied research supports multiple focus areas, each of which represents an identified barrier/gap which must be addressed for successful implementation of 'omic-informed personalized medicine. Focus areas for applied research include knowledge generation research; ethical legal and social issues/ policy research; bioinformatics research; educational research; research for development of advanced genomic diagnostic system. For efforts supported by this program element, research will be pursued with the intent to support solutions that answer Air Force specific needs. During this process, the efforts of other government agencies in those areas will be assessed to avoid redundancy. B.

Project funding was divided into basic science, applied research, technology development and concept advanced development efforts. A key priority of the TBI/PH research program is to complement ongoing DoD efforts to ensure the health and readiness of our military forces by promoting a better standard of care for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and TBI in the areas of prevention, detection, diagnosis (identification of the nature and cause of an illness), treatment, and rehabilitation. Program announcements, programmatic reviews, Service-requested nominations, and ongoing studies that would benefit from program acceleration have been incorporated to address these priorities and gather proposals. In the area of TBI, researchers performed investigations to find a universally-agreed upon concussion grading system, and continued experiments into the effects of penetrating injuries on the brain and experiments on the effects of blasts on the brain. Proposals were solicited in the areas of blast- induced hyper-acceleration upon the generation of TBI and the role of inflammation in spreading TBI damage. In addition, a new Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) neurotrauma consortium program announcement was released to form a five-year, multi-university consortium to discover mechanisms of treatment and the long-term effects of TBI and its relationship to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease diagnosed properly after death in patients with a history of multiple concussions. Multiple awards relevant to combat casualty care were made including development of a large animal model of penetrating ballistic brain injury and development of metrics to define concussion and grade TBI.

Preventing blunt trauma injury is one of the critical components of body armor design. For the Army Medical Command and the Army Research, Development, and Engineering Command, the Underbody Blast (UBB) Testing medical research project provides funds to establish a scientific and statistical basis for evaluating skeletal injuries to vehicle occupants during ground vehicle UBB events. Areas of interest to the Secretary of Defense are medical research that provides an understanding of the human response and tolerance limits and injury mechanisms needed to accurately predict skeletal injuries to ground combat vehicle occupants caused by UBB events. This enhanced understanding will support the establishment of an improved capability to conduct Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation and to make acquisition decisions. For the Army Medical Command, beginning in FY14, Military Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Research Program funding is transferred from the Army to the Defense Health Program. This project funds research to develop candidate HIV vaccines, to assess their safety and effectiveness in human subjects, and to protect military personnel from risks associated with HIV infection. For the Army Medical Command, the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB) Deployed Warfighter Protection project provides for the development of new or improved protection of ground forces from disease-carrying insects. For the Army Medical Command, four Centers of Excellence (CoE) receive medical technology development funds. The Breast Cancer Center of Excellence (Army) provides a multidisciplinary approach as the standard of care for treating breast diseases and breast cancer. The Gynecologic Center of Excellence (Army) focuses on characterizing the molecular alterations associated with benign and malignant gynecologic disease and facilitates the development of novel early detection, prevention and biologic therapeutics (a medicinal preparation created by a biological process used to treat diseases) for the management of gynecologic disease. The Cardiac Health Center of Excellence (Army) provides evidence-based personalized patient engagement approaches for comprehensive cardiac (pertaining to the heart) event prevention through education, outcomes research and technology tools, as well as molecular research to detect cardiovascular (CV) (pertaining to the heart and blood vessels) disease at an early stage to ultimately discover a signature for CV health, to find new genes that significantly increase risk for heart attack in Service members and other beneficiaries, and identify molecular markers of obesity and weight loss. The Pain Center of Excellence (Army) examines the relationship between acute (rapid onset and/or short course) and chronic (persistent or long-lasting, usually longer than 3 months) pain and focuses on finding, implementing, and evaluating the most effective methods of relieving the acute pain caused by combat trauma and the effect this has throughout the continuum to rehabilitation and reintegration. In FY15, the Pain CoE funding line is transferred from Army to USUHS. In FY13, DHP funded the following Congressional Special Interest (CSI) peer-reviewed directed research: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (degenerative neuronal disorder that causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body), Autism, Bone Marrow Failure Disease, Ovarian Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) (disease that affects the brain and the spinal cord and causes severe physical and mental complications), Cancer, Lung Cancer, Orthopedic Research, Spinal Cord Research, Vision, Traumatic Brain Injury and Psychological Health (TBI/PH), Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Gulf War Illness, Alcohol and Substance Use Disorders, Medical Research, Alzheimer Research, Joint Warfighter Medical Research, Global HIV/AIDS Prevention, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (rare multi-system genetic disease that causes growth of non-malignant tumors in the brain and other vital organs), Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (gene mutation affecting approximately 1 in 3600 boys that causes Volume 1 - 57UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115HP: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 4 of 76 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Defense Health Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0603115HP / Medical Technology Development muscle degeneration and eventual death), and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Comprehensive Cancer Center. Because of the CSI annual structure, out-year funding is not programmed. For the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, this program element includes funds for research management support costs. The Outside Continental US (OCONUS) laboratories conduct focused medical research on vaccine development for Malaria, Diarrhea Diseases, and Dengue Fever. In addition to entomology, HIV studies, surveillance and outbreak response under the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance (GEIS) program and risk assessment studies on a number of other infectious diseases that are present in the geographical regions where the laboratories are located. The CONUS laboratories conduct research on Military Operational Medicine, Combat Casualty Care, Diving and Submarine Medicine, Infectious Diseases, Environmental and Occupational Health, Directed Energy, and Aviation Medicine and Human Performance. For the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), funding in this program element supports the Air Force Surgeon General's vision for \"Trusted Care Anywhere\" through a robust research and development program. Medical development programs are divided into five primary thrust areas: Enroute care, Expeditionary Medicine, Operational Medicine (in-garrison care), Force Health Protection (FHP) (detect, prevent, threats), and Human Performance. Expeditionary Medicine is focused on care on the battlefield and in field hospitals prior to transporting patients out of theater to CONUS, and studies trauma resuscitation, hemorrhage control, and other life- saving interventions to keep critically wounded patients alive in the golden hour and to the next level of care. The AFMS is the only service transporting patients on long aeromedical evacuation missions from theater to Landstuhl and from Landstuhl to CONUS. Therefore, the Enroute Care thrust area studies include patient timing to transport, cabin altitude, noise, vibration, and environmental issues affecting patient physiology on the aircraft, and the Human Performance thrust area compliments Enroute Care through its studies on medic and aircrew performance on long missions, as well as special operations forces performance. Medical development and biomedical technology investments in FHP seek to deliver an improved force health protection capability across the full spectrum of operations with research that prevents injury/illness through improved identification and control of health risks. Under Force Health Protection, sub-project areas include: Directed Energy, Occupational and Environmental Health, and Advanced Diagnostics/Therapeutics. Operational medicine is focused on in garrison care - our next most critical issue post OIF/OEF - and how to care for the whole patient and consideration of comorbidities in treatment of wounded warriors and dependents. For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), Medical Development programs include the Neuroscience CoE, the Prostate Cancer CoE, and the Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine. The Neuroscience Center of Excellence (CoE), formerly a Congressional Special Interest program, was chartered in 2002 to conduct basic, clinical and translational research studies of militarily relevant neurological disorders affecting US service members and military medical beneficiaries. The Center's mission is to improve prevention, diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders that directly affect warfighters through a multi- site research program that collaborates broadly with military, civilian and federal medical institutions. The Prostate CoE, formerly a Congressional Special Interest program, was chartered in 1992 to conduct basic, clinical and translational research programs to combat diseases of the prostate. The program's mission is fulfilled primarily through its three principal programs- the Clinical Translational Research Center, the Basic Science Research Program and the Tri-Service Multicenter Prostate Cancer Database which encompasses its clinical research work with other participating military medical centers. These affiliated sites contribute data and biospecimens obtained from prostate cancer patients and participate in clinical trials. The Center for Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine (CNRM) brings together the expertise of clinicians and scientists across disciplines to catalyze innovative approaches to traumatic brain injury (TBI) research. CNRM Research Programs emphasize aspects of high relevance to military populations, with a primary focus on patients at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.

Military operational medicine efforts focused on: validation of dose response curves for noise induced hearing loss, use of animal models to determine protective capabilities within the inner ear using antioxidants and determine the most effective doses and maximum time delays to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. This information will result in significant reductions in noise-related compensation claims to the Department of Veterans Affairs and facilitate the return-to-duty for injured Warfighters. Additional efforts focused on: performance validation of the surface-mounted clay add-on device using live-fire tests of military-grade armor systems providing the first biomedically valid behind-body-armor design standard as a replacement to the current Department of Justice standard. This will allow equipment developers to design body armor appropriate to the specific needs of each region of the body. Other efforts entailed: (1) conducting human clinical trials of the Hydration Status Monitor (a device to monitor fluid intake and electrolyte imbalance) for diagnostic and biological testing; (2) field studies to determine the effect of vitamin D and calcium supplements on nutritional status of Warfighters leading to improved bone health and mitigating the potential for bone stress fractures; and (3) validation of constructs of Warfighters performance, mental strength and psychological well-being using current psychological assessment tools providing a validated portfolio of self-reporting instruments capable of assessing various psychological attributes of military personnel, thereby enhancing psychological resilience. Combat casualty care research pursued successful studies, from FY11-13, such as the study of enhanced oxygen delivery in acute spinal cord injury, the plasma volume expander, red blood cell storage research and started technology development of platelet-derived agents to stop bleeding and neuromodulation (a treatment that delivers either electricity or drugs to nerves in order to change their activity) for the repair of traumatic injuries to the brain. Due to sequestration, a program announcement in the areas of en route care and forward surgical and intensive battlefield care was deferred.

Sensory system efforts to be initiated in FY13 were postponed to FY14 due to sequestration. FY 2014 Plans: Medical training and health information sciences research efforts are working in two primary research portfolios: Medical Simulation and Training, and Health Informatics and Information Technology. Medical simulation and training focus is on research opportunities identified by the Combat Casualty Training Consortium (CCTC), which is identifying potential gaps where simulation technology can be utilized to support combat medic training and has the impact of reducing and refining live-tissue training. Additional emphasis is being placed on the technologies to teach and train effective team communication. The concept of an open-source tissue model for developers and end-users to facilitate cohesive content delivery for manikins or virtual models is in progress. The medical practice initiative efforts are aimed at understanding healthcare personnel skill decay through improved team training and its correlation with skill. Health informatics and information technology conducts research on risk reduction within the Military Health System to identify ways to reduce potential near- and long-term cost of information technology and systems, as well as the transition of a joint Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and DoD integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR). Clinical decision support exploration within nursing continues within the portfolio. The military infectious diseases research program is funding one multi-year, clinical study for development of an antibacterial drug against multiple drug resistant bacteria in antimicrobial countermeasures; one host/pathogen biomarker project in wound infection prevention and management for detection of bacterial infection in wounds; and one diagnostic project in wound infection prevention and management for the detection of bacterial infections in wounds. Military operational medicine research will be continuing medical technology development efforts initiated in FY13 in nutrition and dietary supplements, Warfighter performance and sustainment in extreme environments (such as extreme heat, cold, or altitude), establishment of return to duty/medical standards criteria, blast injury models and performance standards for protections systems, diagnostics and metrics for hearing loss and protection, alcohol and substance abuse, diagnosis and treatment of deployment-related psychological health problems, diagnosis and treatment of PTSD, military family and Warfighter resilience, suicide prevention, pulmonary health (pertaining to the lungs) in the deployed environment, and blast exposure during breaching (process used to force open closed and/or locked doors).

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Cardiac Health Center of Excellence (Army), also known as the Integrative Cardiac Health Project (ICHP), the focus is the investigation of cutting-edge patient- centric approaches to cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk assessment and risk reduction by incorporating biomolecular (pertaining to organic molecules occurring in living organisms) research to detect CVD at an early stage, and identifying markers of increased risk for heart attack in service members. Using a systems biology outcomes research approach, ICHP characterizes relationships between CVD, other cardio-metabolic disease states and maladaptive lifestyle behavior patterns unique to service members such as pre-diabetes, stress, obesity and sleep disorders with the aim of targeting these disorders in their pre-clinical phase and achieving ideal/ optimal cardiovascular health goals outlined by the American Heart Association. ICHP's ultimate goal is to translate the evidence-based research findings for application into clinical practice in an effort to achieve the following research aims: (1) improve Force Health by better understanding the CVD risk susceptibility of military-specific populations such as Wounded Warriors through leading-edge research using novel tools and technologies, (2) investigate and create transformational models of healthcare delivery through personalized CVD prevention tracks as an adjunct to traditional care, and (3) refine individualized prevention strategies through statistical data modeling to define the most cost-effective and sustainable approaches in promoting cardiovascular health throughout the military lifecycle.

In examining a novel scientific process, ICHP utilized a modified serum DNA amplification process in samples from the DoD serum repository. If successful, the CoE will obtain DNA from the DoD serum repository samples for future studies. This will be the first step to use this technique to identify young military members at risk for heart attack. ICHP is continuing development of a robust data management system. This enhanced integrative data collection is designed to capture a full picture of the individual to include physiological, behavioral, biochemical and molecular information. Our platform gathered an expansive number of data points that when leveraged can create new tools and refine processes to better define wellness, predict disease, empower patients, transform delivery to improve quality of life and deliver personalized CVD prevention in the military population. ICHP's vision of lifelong cardiovascular health supports the Military Health System (MHS) Strategic Plan creating value to the MHS. FY 2014 Plans: The Cardiac Health Center of Excellence (Army), also known as the Integrative Cardiac Health Project (ICHP), is continuing research studies initiated in FY12-13. Data collection from approved FY12-13 protocols is continuing and being analyzed and synthesized.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS), the Prostate Cancer Center of Excellence (CoE), formerly a Congressional Special Interest program, the Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR), was chartered in 1992 to conduct basic, clinical and translational research programs to combat diseases of the prostate. The CPDR studies prostate cancer and prostate diseases in the military health care system. The program's mission is fulfilled primarily through its three principal programs- the Clinical Translational Research, the Basic Science Research and the Tri-Service Multicenter Database which includes five participating military medical centers. The CPDR has been conducting patient centric cutting-edge translational research to improve the management of all stages of prostate cancer for over 22 yrs as recognized by nearly 400 scientific publications. CPDR has also been committed to the research training of the next generation of DoD doctors and scientists (USU medical and graduate students and Walter Reed residents). Many of the trainees are now service chiefs and program directors in prestigious military and civilian medical centers. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Title: CoE-Prostate Cancer Center of Excellence (USUHS) Description: The CPDR is at the forefront of cutting-edge clinical research improving diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer involving new modalities such as, MRI guided biopsy, and evaluation of new drugs and vaccines for advanced prostate cancer. The CPDR Database continues to highlight emerging issues in prostate cancer management such as, treatment outcomes, ethnic differences and quality of life. In light of current treatment challenges with early detected prostate cancers in PSA testing era and poorly understood biology of prostate cancer, CPDR's high-impact research is focusing on cancer causing genes that will lead to better diagnostic and prognostic markers in the management of the disease. New gene discoveries are also unraveling ethnic differences of prostate cancer biology that has potential to enhance personalized medicine.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 CPDR continues to lead its original discovery towards evaluations of a common defect of ERG cancer gene in prostate cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development of the CPDR-ERG monoclonal antibody has streamlined the world-wide evaluations of the ERG oncoprotein in clinical specimens. New ground-breaking research from CPDR has established unexpected ethnic differences of ERG frequencies between Caucasian Americans and African American patients. These results for the first time have potential to define molecular basis of ethnic differences in prostate cancer which has implications in both the fields of biomarker performance and personalized medicine. A new CPDR initiative has led to the generation of whole-genome and transcriptome data in a matched cohort of African American and Caucasian American patients that is anticipated to enhance the understanding of genomic differences of prostate cancer between these ethnic groups. Cancer biology evaluation of the most common prostate cancer gene ERG in transgenic mouse model has provided new insights into the mechanisms of ERG functions in prostate cancer initiation and progression. Towards developing innovative prostate cancer diagnosis and prognosis platforms, collaborations are in progress with leading companies such as, Genomic Health, Iris Molecular Diagnostics, Berg Pharma, Biocare Medical and Exosome. Hormonal mechanisms play central roles in prostate cancer onset of progression. CPDR has developed a new marker panel to read out the defects of hormone pathways in subsets of prostate cancers that may represent highly aggressive disease. CPDR has also made a discovery of a new pathway for androgen receptor degradation which has future potential in treatment of advanced prostate cancer. The National Database program continues to enroll men with prostatic diseases including clinico-pathologic, demographic, and longitudinal follow-up and treatment outcomes data. A new collaborative initiative has been established to evaluate the utility of a prognostic Oncotype DX prostate cancer panel developed by Genomic Heath.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification To better protect mounted warriors from the effects of underbody blast (UBB) caused by landmines or Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), the Underbody Blast (UBB) Testing medical research project will provide new data on the biomechanics of human skeletal response that occurs in an attack on a ground combat vehicle. The data will provide a biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin (the Warrior Injury Assessment Manikin or WIAMan project) and the required biomedically-valid injury criteria that can be used in Title 10 Live Fire Test and Evaluation to characterize dynamic events, the risk of injury to mounted warriors, and to support acquisition decisions. This new data will also benefit the overall DOD effort in vehicle and protection technology for the UBB threat. This work is needed to overcome the limitations of the current test manikin and injury criteria which were designed for the civilian automotive industry for frontal crash testing and as such are not adequate in the combat environment. The current manikins do not represent the modern Soldier and were not designed for the vertical acceleration environment associated with UBB events. Consequently, current LFT&E crew survivability assessment methodologies are limited in their ability to predict the types and severity of injuries seen in these events. Due to this technology gap, military ground vehicles are being fielded without fully defined levels of injury risk and crew survivability for UBB events. The data produced by this project will be used to satisfy a critical need for a scientifically valid capability for analyzing the risk of injury caused by UBB. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Title: Underbody Blast Testing Description: Will provide an understanding of the biomechanics of skeletal injuries that occur in a combat vehicle UBB event involving a landmine or IED, and will provide the biomedical basis for the development of a Warrior-representative blast test manikin and associated biomedically-validated injury criteria that can be used to characterize dynamic events and injury risks for live-fire test and evaluation (LFT&E) crew survivability assessments and vehicle development efforts to better protect Warriors from UBB threats. FY 2013 Accomplishments: The Underbody Blast Testing project collected human response data in a blast environment, including whole-body kinematics (measurement of motion), biofidelity data, and injury data for a seated soldier. This included fabricating and proof testing a first- of-its-kind blast experimental facility for medical research and the associated research techniques. The research considered the effects of warrior posture, the effects of wearing personal protective equipment, and the severity of the UBB threat. Matched pair testing clearly demonstrated differences between the current manikin and actual human response.

Research plan reviews and test readiness reviews were conducted to define and approve subsequent research for whole-bodies and within particular body regions. Initial research was conducted for the head and neck body region to gather biofidelity and injury data. In addition, a first of its kind review was held to present the medical researchers with de-identified medical images of soldier injuries caused by UBB. This data is critical to assuring that the Underbody Blast Testing project is producing data that is relevant to the military environment. FY 2014 Plans: The Underbody Blast Testing project will be focused on generating and providing medical research data needed to support the development of the WIAMan anthropomorphic (resembling a human) test device concept and the first generation prototype. The emphasis will be on non-injurious or biofidelity data but will also include injurious testing. All body regions will be addressed including whole-body testing and also prioritized testing of the following body regions, foot and ankle, leg, pelvis, lumbar spine, thoracic spine, cervical spine, torso, head and neck. Medical research is adding variations in boundary conditions and other initial condition, including the effect of personal protective equipment. Conduct studies to contrast injuries observed in theater with those created in the test program to validate and prioritize research. Emerging medical research data will be disseminated to the RDT&E community to support protection technology development and modeling and simulation initiatives. FY 2015 Plans: The Underbody Blast Testing project will continue medical research in the areas initiated in FY14 but with the emphasis shifting during the year from non-injurious conditions to those which cause injuries. This will enable the development of initial human injury probability curves that account for influences unique to the military and UBB environment. All data will continue to be transitioned into the WIAMan project to enable the fabrication of the first and second generation prototype anthropometric test devices (ATDs). Continue studies to contrast injuries observed in theater with those created in the test program to validate and prioritize research. Emerging medical research data will be disseminated to the RDT&E community to support protection technology development and modeling and simulation initiatives.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification For the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB), the Deployed Warfighter Protection project plans to develop new or improved protection for ground forces from disease-carrying insects. The focus of this program is to develop new or improved systems for controlling insects that carry disease under austere, remote, and combat conditions; understand the physiology of insecticidal activity to develop new compounds with greater specific activity and/or higher user acceptability; examine existing area repellents for efficacy and develop new spatially effective repellent systems useful in military situations; develop new methods or formulations for treating cloth to prevent vector biting; and expand the number of active ingredients and formulations of public health pest pesticides, products and application technologies available for safe, and effective applications. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Title: Deployed Warfighter Protection Description: The Deployed Warfighter Protection Program will develop new or improved protection for ground forces from disease-carrying insects. FY 2013 Accomplishments: The Deployed Warfighter Protection research project expanded and continued implementing plans from FY12 to include new and improved control methods for mosquitoes, sand flies, filth flies and other insects of military importance; assessing innovative spray equipment and conducting pesticide efficacy trials in desert, temperate and tropical environments. This included refocusing control strategies for mosquitoes and sand flies, which are considered the main disease-bearing insect threats to deployed forces; new insect repellent systems and the modification of insecticide application technologies that are more effectively targeting disease carrying insects impacting military readiness. DWFP funded research efforts conducted by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service were featured in the November/December 2012 edition of the USDA ARS Magazine (See: http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/nov12/index.htm). The article provided an overview of the DoD funded research conducted by the USDA ARS highlighting synergistic efforts specifically meeting the needs of the military and notable for having an exceptional return on investment ratio of approximately 3 dollars of research effort for every 1 DWFP dollar invested. Similar successes were achieved in the competitive grant portfolio where DWFP managed 15 grants given to industry, academia and government labs in FY13. So far in FY13 DWFP produced an additional market-ready product and several more expected in the coming months. Specifically, attractive targeted sugar bait (ATSB\u00ae) received a registered trademark, patented use, commercial partner and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-approved label for the professional product being evaluated for3.924 5.420 4.553 Volume 1 - 127UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115HP: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 74 of 76 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Defense Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Medical Technology DevelopmentProject (Number/Name) 830A / Deployed Warfighter Protection (Army) B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 efficacy in mosquito control districts throughout CONUS and against sand flies in Europe. Feedback from these trials will impact the final military use product. Other significant accomplishments included several material transfer agreements with both US and international companies to evaluate and develop products used around the globe for insect protection, but not currently available in the US. These included spatial / area repellents; a critical replacement for permethrin treatment of military uniforms to make them repellent against biting insects; new specialized spray products for treating aircraft and ships; and durable insecticidal lining materials for attaching to interior walls of tents and more permanent structures. Significant advances were also made toward commercial development of an additional pesticide active ingredient for use as a rodent feed-through insecticide for killing desert sand flies that transmit human disease to military personnel. Numerous commercially available and experimental insecticides and sprayers were evaluated with the best performers added to the military stock system for use by combat forces. Two US patents were issued and seven submitted for products with military utility. These comprised the ATSB method; two new spatial repellents; a topical repellent more potent and longer-lasting than the common DEET; insecticide curtains for keeping insects out of aircraft and ships; specialized formulation of a toxicant (poison that is made by humans) used in a DWFP patented mosquito trap; a skin applied product that prevents insects from detecting human odors; an atomizer to produce ultra small droplets needed to kill flying mosquitoes; and a new bed net fabric design. Arising from the cumulative DWFP efforts on sand fly control, AFPMB approved the addition of a DoD technical guide for sand fly biology and control globally. During FY13, more than 70 additional peer reviewed scientific publications resulted from DWFP efforts. New and ongoing efforts are detailed in the FY14 section below. Multiple USDA and Competitive Grant projects were delayed by 3 to 6 months due to reduced funding for FY13. FY 2014 Plans: The Deployed Warfighter Protection project continues FY13 efforts concentrating on developing products and resources to enable combat forces to better protect themselves and control militarily important insects that bite, sting and transmit force degrading diseases. This is accomplished through continuing R&D to discover, develop, patent, license, produce and secure commercially feasible products, and EPA registration of new and improved insecticides, application technologies and repellent systems. The DWFP is: (1) actively pursuing EPA product label changes for use against disease-carrying insects threatening deployments outside the United States; (2) continuing field trials, engaging regional, national and international commercial partners and developing reduced risk pesticides such as ATSBs\u00ae and other insecticides found to be effective for desert sand flies, blood- sucking flies and filth fly control; (3) continuing cooperative work and formal Agreements with industry promoting insecticide development and EPA registrations; (4) evaluating insect control materials and application technologies in collaboration with military labs and others in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Pacific; (5) conducting field trials of patented next generation \"lethal ovitraps\" designed to attract and kill disease carrying mosquitoes when they are trying to lay their eggs; (6) optimizing patented molecular, highly specific insecticides based on genes specific for target insects; (7) continuing field evaluations of experimental and military stock listed equipment and insecticides against CONUS and OCONUS medically important insects; (8) continuing evaluations of new commercial sprayers, with best performing products added to the military stock system; (9) continuing assessments of how insecticide aerosols kill insects in desert, temperate and tropical environments; (10) continuing CONUS Volume 1 - 128UNCLASSIFIED PE 0603115HP: Medical Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 75 of 76 R-1 Line #6Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Defense Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Medical Technology DevelopmentProject (Number/Name) 830A / Deployed Warfighter Protection (Army) B.

Given FY13 funding levels, the Program did not issue a request for proposals as part of the Competitive Grant program for new FY14 starts. FY 2015 Plans: The Deployed Warfighter Protection (DWFP) project will continue to develop and field tools that enable deployed forces to better protect themselves and control militarily important insects that bite, sting and transmit force degrading diseases. This will be accomplished through continued research, testing and evaluation, patent submissions, licensing, and EPA registrations for new insecticides, application technologies and repellent systems. DWFP will prioritize research efforts that focus on critical gaps identified by the Services and Combatant Commands to control insects (mosquitoes, sand flies, fleas, flies, mites, and ticks) and provide tools in 3 thrust areas: personal protection systems, insecticides and application technologies. Focus areas which will continue for FY15 include: Enhanced Personal Protection Systems: Transition prototype bite-proof fabrics from the lab to initial field testing; continue safety, efficacy, user acceptability and durability studies of combat uniforms treated with a new chemical to replace permethrin; and transition lab prototype micro-dispensers and textile-based area/spatial-repellent dispensers for arthropod repellent/toxicants to initial field tests. New Insecticides: Work with the EPA to pursue EPA product label changes for use against disease-carrying insects threatening deployments outside the United States; continue FY14 collaborations and formal agreements with industry partners to develop new insecticides for EPA registration; initiate semi-field testing of molecular pesticides that attack specific genes in the insect and new essential oil insecticides and synergists; continue studies to determine how insecticides kill insects in order to support development of improved insect control technologies effective in desert, temperate and tropical environments; and continue screening efforts to evaluate plant-derived and other natural insect control compound with improved safety profiles and high potential for military use.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The Army Medical Command received PE 0605013 funding to identify, explore, and demonstrate key information technologies to overcome medical and military unique technology barriers. Programs include Army service level support for the Medical Operational Data System (MODS), the Army Medicine Chief Information Officer's (CIO) Management Operations, the Army Warrior Care and Transition System (AWCTS), the Psychological and Behavioral Health - Tools for Evaluation, Risk, and Management (PBH-TERM), the Workload Management System for Nursing - Internet (WMSNi), the Multidrug-Resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network (MRSN), and the Veterinary Services Systems Management (VSSM). The Navy Medical Command RDT&E funding supports the development required for those systems which are integral to Navy Medicine (i.e., Navy Medicine Online (NMO)). Navy Medicine also funds, when appropriate, a number of small-scale, opportunistic business improvements when the technology makes a sudden advance. These projects are generally not in the scope of the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA) Central Programs such as the development/integration of Defense Optical Fabrication Enterprise Management System (DOFEMS) into a fully automated system to support workload distribution, performance metrics, staffing requirements, supply management, calculation of operating costs from the current independently or manually DOFEMS system. This effort will be a web based centralized management tool and provide a standalone standard set of Lab Management software for all 26 Navy labs. Additionally, the re-design of HIV Management System (HMS) will be more user friendly, less time to perform everyday tasks and prevents the need to maintain separate databases. The re-design will also automate and minimize functions that require manual assistance and assist in fulfilling new requirements. For the Air Force Medical Service (AFMS), this program element supports IM/IT development requirements within four AFMS Chief Information Officer defined core capabilities as essential to Air Force Medical Service IM/IT mission support. Data warehousing, reporting services, systems integration, and custom application development are featured in almost all IM/IT systems and application requests. The information needs of the AFMS are growing in volume, complexity, and delivery formats. In order to meet future requirements, aggregation of more and varied data sources require increasingly complex data warehousing capabilities. Demand for Volume 1 - 147UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605013HP: Information Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 4 of 74 R-1 Line #8Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Defense Health Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0605013HP / Information Technology Development dynamic analytic capability will require investments in business intelligence, predictive analytic tools, open source research data models, and emerging personalized medicine analysis. Information is still largely produced in an ad hoc manner without standard methodologies, mapping of business requirements, transparent analytic models, and distributed by office productivity software. Centralized production of standard reports, balance sheets, and dynamic query tools would relieve many managers and action officer of routine work and increase leadership decision support. AFMS medical readiness reporting and tracking has set the standard in the DoD for over a decade but multiple applications now encompass what has merged into a common process of tracking unit capability and personal health assessments. Consolidation of medical readiness applications would streamline disability, medical readiness, deployment surveillance, and flying status tracking and reporting who currently must move between multiple applications. For the Air Force, the funding in this program element provides for sustainment of the IM/IT Test Bed (IMIT-TB) capability, which is a dedicated OT location and staff encompassing the entire spectrum of healthcare services and products available in MTFs, to provide risk controlled testing of designated core and interim medical applications in a live environment. The MHS centrally-managed, Tri-Service IM/IT RDT&E program includes funding for development/integration, test and evaluation for the following initiatives of special interest: 1) Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) which is a new Major Automated Information System (MAIS) program designed to replace/sunset the current portfolio of systems providing initial Electronic Health Record (EHR) capability, such as AHLTA (which is DoD\u00b4s current EHR and one of the world's largest clinical information systems that provides worldwide online access to patients medical records) and the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) (which is the military's legacy computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system used for ordering/documenting lab tests, radiology exams, prescription transactions, and for documenting outpatient appointments as well as other care that is administered). iEHR will establish a comprehensive, longitudinal, electronic health record that will also support the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) HEALTH initiative. Commensurate with the OSD AT&L Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), dated July 21, 2013, the former joint DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program has been restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and the joint iEHR program; 2) Theater Medical Information Program-Joint (TMIP-J) integrates components of the military medical information systems to ensure interoperable medical support for all Theater and deployed forces; 3) Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) provides integrated supply chain and life cycle management for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, equipment, health facilities, and services; 4) Executive Information/Decision Support (EI/DS) receives, stores, processes data from MHS systems used for managing the business of health care; 5) Defense Occupational and Environmental Health Readiness System - Industrial Hygiene (DOEHRS-IH) assembles, evaluates and stores data on occupational personnel exposure information, workplace environment monitoring, personnel protective equipment usage, and observation of work practices. The Central IM/IT Program also provides RDT&E funding for mission essential initiatives such as: funding for other related technical activities such as shared services investment and for various Wounded, Ill and Injured (WII) Warrior initiatives like Health Artifact and Image Management Solution (HAIMS), and Federated Registry Framework. The DHP RDT&E appropriation includes the following TMA initiatives: Electronic Commerce System (E-Commerce): This system was developed for centralized collection, integration, and reporting of accurate purchased care contracting and financial data. It provides an integrated set of data reports from multiple data sources to management, as well as tools to control the end-to-end program change management process. E-Commerce is composed of several major applications including: Contract Management (CM), utilizing Prism software to support contract action development and documentation; Resource Management (RM), employing Oracle Federal Financials and TED interface software to support the budgeting, accounting, case recoupment, and disbursement processes; Document Management, utilizing Document software to provide electronic storage, management, and retrieval of contract files; Management Tracking and Reporting, utilizing custom software to Volume 1 - 148UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605013HP: Information Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 5 of 74 R-1 Line #8Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Defense Health Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0605013HP / Information Technology Development provide reports to assist in the management and tracking of changes to the managed care contracts as well as current and out year liabilities; the Purchased Care and Contractor's Resource Center web sites that provide up-to-date financial information for both TMA and the Services concerning the military treatment facilities (MTFs), and expenditures for MTF enrollee purchased care and supplemental care. E-Commerce includes an infrastructure of over 60 servers supporting development, test, and production. E-Commerce is employed by several hundred users in more than 7 different organizations. Project oversight and coordination must be provided to ensure that the needs of the disparate organizations are met without influencing system performance or support to any individual user. Server configurations must remain current with respect to security policies, user authorizations, and interactions with other systems and functions. All of these activities must be managed and coordinated on a daily basis. Disability Mediation Service (DMS): The VTA (Veteran's Tracking Application) has been the primary system to track, record, and report data for the IDES (Integrated Disability Evaluation System) process. The VTA is scheduled to sun-set, by VA (Veterans Affairs), and the data is being moved to another application. Migration of VTA to another application creates the requirement to allow data exchange between Service non-medical case management and new VA DES (Disability Evaluation System) IT application. The BEC (Benefits Executive Council) is looking to create a DMS (Disability Mediation Service), which is an integrator between the Services and VA. The DMS will facilitate the improvement of non-medical case management tracking and IDES data/information management. It will eliminate redundant data entry within DoD (Department of Defense), improving data quality by capturing more data for operational reporting from the Services and WCP, decrease backlog by eliminating data entry duplication, and minimize impact to DoD Services by allowing the Services to continue using their existing/planned systems without requiring retraining on a new applications. The DMS will be created from existing technology. It will provide a mediation service to help isolate each system from changes and uniqueness in the other systems and allow the Services and WCP to report and drill down on data that we capture during the exchange. This IT solution will not replace current DoD systems, but will require some modifications and enhancements to those systems to support the date exchange. WCP will support development costs for these efforts. Services will assume responsibility and POM costs for modifications, enhancements, and maintenance in the out years.\" B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The primary goal of the VLER Health initiative is to enable the secure sharing of health information (i.e., demographic and clinical data) between DoD and external Federal and private sector partners which meets Meaningful Use (MU) requirements to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency. By electronically sharing health information using national standards, that information can support tracking key clinical conditions, communicating that information to better coordinate care, and engaging patients in their own care. The VLER Health initiative provides clinicians with the most up-to-date information, potentially reducing redundant diagnostic tests, medical errors, paperwork and handling, and overall healthcare costs. These benefits, in turn, align with the MHS quadruple aim by ensuring that the military force is medically ready to deploy; the military beneficiary population remains healthy through focused prevention; patient care is convenient, equitable, safe, and of the highest quality; and the total cost of healthcare is reduced through the reduction of waste and focus on quality. VLER Health funding will be reflected in the Integrated Electronic Health Record Program Element 0605023 in FY 2014 and out. B. Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 Title: Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) HEALTH (Tri-Service) Description: Work with Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), and Private Sector to expand VLER. FY 2013 Accomplishments: VLER Exchange (the DoD system responsible for exchanging health information with both Federal and private healthcare partners) deployed a new release that included technical enhancements (e.g., an upgrade in the CONNECT software from version 2.4.7 to 3.3) to improve its speed and reliability. VLER Exchange deployed new functionality at select pilot sites to enable non-active duty medical beneficiaries to opt out from sharing their health information with external partners; to enable DoD to display, approve, and reject SSA authorization forms; and provide the ability to accept and send additional patient health data to and from external partners via structured and unstructured documents in a safe and secure manner, in accordance with DoD privacy and security requirements. An opt-in/opt-out policy for non-active duty medical beneficiaries was drafted and will be evaluated and finalized after the new VLER Exchange functionality and technical upgrades deployed at pilot sites are evaluated. The purpose of the pilot is to validate business rules, inform policy, and assess improvements in the system's speed and reliability.7.458 - - Volume 1 - 175UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605013HP: Information Technology Development UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 32 of 74 R-1 Line #8Exhibit R-2A , RDT&E Project Justification: PB 2015 Defense Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130 / 2R-1 Information DevelopmentProject (Number/Name) 386A / Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) HEALTH (Tri-Service) B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification In March 2008, the MHS embarked upon Electronic Health Record (EHR) modernization planning, establishing the initial Electronic Health Records Way Ahead (EHRWA). In March 2011, the Program was expanded to include the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in a joint initiative to implement a new, integrated electronic health record for both Departments, called the Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program. Secretary Hagel's Memorandum titled \"Integrated Electronic Health Records,\" dated May 2013, provided additional direction to the program: DoD shall continue near-term coordinated efforts with VA to develop data federation, presentation, and interoperability. This near-term goal shall be pursued as a first priority separately from the longer-term goal of health record information technology (IT) modernization. DoD shall pursue a full and open competition for a core set of capabilities for EHR modernization. To fulfill Secretary Hagel's directive, parallel programs have been defined, splitting the original iEHR program into two distinct areas. In the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) Acquisition Decision Memorandum (ADM), dated June 21, 2013 and an ADM providing direction and guidance for PEO DHMS issued on January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program has been restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program Volume 1 - 219UNCLASSIFIED PE 0605023HP: Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) UNCLASSIFIED Defense Health Program Page 2 of 10 R-1 Line #9Exhibit R-2 , RDT&E Budget Item Justification: PB 2015 Defense Health Program Date: March 2014 Appropriation/Budget Activity 0130: Defense Health Program / BA 2: RDT&ER-1 Program Element (Number/Name) PE 0605023HP / Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) and a newly defined iEHR program focused on providing seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and VA (renamed Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX)). iEHR RDT&E is reported under the program element (PE) 0605013 through FY 2013 inclusive, but iEHR, VLER Health and DHMSM will be reported under new program element 0605023 for FY 2014.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Commensurate with the OSD AT&L Acquisition Decision Memoranda (ADM), dated July 21, 2013 and January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and VA iEHR program has been restructured within the DoD to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and a redefined iEHR program. These programs report through the PEO DoD Healthcare Management Systems (DHMS) to the USD (AT&L). The redefined iEHR program will be called the Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX) and will encompass health data sharing and interoperability across the lifecycle to include data sharing/interoperability with the VA, private healthcare providers and patients. The iEHR Increment 1 initiative will complete delivery of its defined requirements in FY2014 and transition into sustainment beginning in FY2015 under the Defense Health Agency Health Information Technology organization. Due to timelines for budget preparation and submission, a separate initiative could not be generated the funding needed for DMIX in FY2015 is reflected this initiative. A new initiative for the DMIX initiative will be formally established with the FY2016 budget. The DMIX program will acquire the capabilities necessary to securely and reliably exchange standardized, normalized, and correlated health data with all partners through standard data / information exchange mechanisms. This will allow users in different places and different organizations to access, use, and supplement health data (technical interoperability) that has a shared meaning so users (assisted by computers) are able to make care decisions (Semantic Interoperability - Level 4). DMIX will consist of Data Federation (DF), Access Management, Service Oriented Architecture / Enterprise Service Bus (SOA/ESB) capabilities, and leverage Identity Management capabilities provided by DMDC. In addition, VLER Health, to include Exchange and Direct, will continue to be part of the DMIX program. Use of the health data may be done via legacy systems, clinical mobile applications and system agnostic viewers such as the Joint Legacy Viewer (JLV). iEHR RDT&E is reported under the program element 0605013 through FY 2013 inclusive, but will be reported under new program element 0605023 for FY 2014 and out. Plans for out year RDT&E are not finalized at this time. B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification The primary goal of the VLER Health initiative is to enable the secure sharing of health information (i.e., demographic and clinical data) between DoD and external Federal and private sector partners which meets Meaningful Use (MU) requirements to improve healthcare quality, safety, and efficiency. By electronically sharing health information using national standards, that information can support tracking key clinical conditions, communicating that information to better coordinate care, and engaging patients in their own care. The VLER Health initiative provides clinicians with the most up-to-date information, potentially reducing redundant diagnostic tests, medical errors, paperwork and handling, and overall healthcare costs. These benefits, in turn, align with the MHS quadruple aim by ensuring that the military force is medically ready to deploy; the military beneficiary population remains healthy through focused prevention; patient care is convenient, equitable, safe, and of the highest quality; and the total cost of healthcare is reduced through the reduction of waste and focus on quality B.

A. Mission Description and Budget Item Justification Commensurate with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)) Acquisition Decision Memoranda (ADM), dated July 21, 2013 and January 2, 2014, the former joint DoD and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Integrated Electronic Health Record (iEHR) program has been restructured to pursue two separate but related healthcare information technology efforts, the DoD Healthcare Management System Modernization (DHMSM) program and a newly defined iEHR program focused on providing seamless integrated sharing of electronic health data between the DoD and VA (renamed Defense Medical Information Exchange (DMIX)). DHMSM will acquire and support deployment, implementation, and sustainment of an electronic health record (EHR) system that replaces the DoD legacy Military Health System (MHS) inpatient and outpatient EHR systems. Overarching goal of the program is to enable healthcare teams to deliver high-quality, safe care and preventive services to patients through the use of easily accessible standards-based computerized patient records resulting in: improved accuracy of diagnoses and impact on health outcomes; increased patient participation in the healthcare process; improved patient-centered care coordination; and increased practice efficiencies in all settings, including operational environments. DHMSM will be executed in two planning Segments. DHMSM Segment 1 will focus on replacement of inpatient and outpatient systems, and will encompass deployment of the enterprise EHR to fixed facilities (garrison and non-garrison), as well as Military Treatment Facilities (MTFs) and clinics. DHMSM Segment 2 will focus on replacement of the in-theater EHR, and will encompass deployment of the enterprise EHR to en route, ship-board, and expeditionary components. The DHMSM program receives oversight and direction from Program Executive Office (PEO) Defense Healthcare Management System (DHMS) and reports to USD (AT&L). Stakeholders include the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs), Defense Health Agency (DHA), USD (AT&L), and PEO DHMS. The customers for this project include the beneficiaries, health care providers, and managers of the Army, Navy and Air Force MTFs and clinics.

Accomplishments/Planned Programs ($ in Millions) FY 2013 FY 2014 FY 2015 OBJECTIVE: The objective of this topic is to develop and demonstrate a wearable finger-mounted ultrasound transducer and ultrasound imaging platform that uses wireless connectivity for image display and operator interface functions on common commercially available hand held platforms. Medics in isolated environments are now conducting FAST exams in the field to determine internal injuries before casualties are transported out of the area and current wired handheld ultrasound transducer/ probes are too large and bulky to be used in the combat environment. Medics need a finger-mounted probe to slide under body armor to examine casualties and have the capability to transmit ultrasound images wirelessly from a wearable finger probe to a SMART device which is connected to a secure communication network that can further transmit these images to a Medical Officer in the rear area. This research will incrementally advance the state of the art for point of injury care and on attended casualty evacuation vehicles such that the final demonstration shows proof-of-concept feasibility for medical information exchange and telementoring from any location on the battlefield.
