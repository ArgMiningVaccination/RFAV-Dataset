Detox supplements are herbal supplements made with natural ingredients that support the natural detox processes in the body. The human body constantly goes through toxin elimination to metabolize waste and get rid of harmful agents. Detox supplements contain active ingredients that give the body a boost to accelerate and support the natural toxin elimination process. Unfortunately, modern life is filled with harmful toxins that create heavy toxic loads that tax the body's natural detox system. Heavy metals, natural toxins, and environmental toxins can accumulate in the body as [ free radicals ](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318652)that cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can cause undue harm by damaging cells and is known to be at the root of many ailments. Normally, the liver detoxes our blood, and residual toxins are then further processed for elimination through other systems like the lymphatic system, the digestive system, the skin, and the lungs. If there are an abundance of toxins, however, these residual, damaging agents can hang out in the vital systems and pose undue harm. Detox products contain herbs to gently help push those agents out of the body in different ways. For example, [dandelion root and leaf ](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/dandelion)contain essential nutrients like vitamin C and other agents that enhance fluid output, support liver function, and work to push toxins out of the body. Benefits of Using Detox Supplements Taking a detox dietary supplement supports the body's natural detox process. With toxin overload, heavy metals and other free radicals can settle into the vital tissues and cause cellular damage. Therefore, a detox supplement or following a detox diet periodically may clear toxins from the system to keep you healthier. Each detoxing agent may provide unique benefits. For example, milk thistle is a good source of [glutathione](https://absolute-health.org/en/blog/post/service-regenerative-detox-liver-detox.html), which supports liver detoxification. [Orange peel](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229983832_The_amino_acids_in_various_tissues_of_citrus_fruits_and_in_orange_protein#) contains the important amino acid glutamic acid (glutamine), which plays an important role in the stability of [good and bad bacteria](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213453021000112) in the digestive tract and aids the immune system. Beyond detox supplements, other healthy lifestyle habits may aid in natural toxin elimination. For example, following a healthy, balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and drinking enough water on a daily basis support everything from immune system function to digestive health.

You may not always know specifically what system needs to be detoxed, such as your kidneys, lymphatic system, or intestines. Nevertheless, your general habits, symptoms, and experiences may help you pick the best product. You may know you need a detox supplement if you feel certain systems have been exposed to more toxins than usual. For example, if you haven't been following a healthy diet and have digestive issues, you may need a supplement to target the digestive tract. By contrast, if substantial drug administration due to a past illness or heavy drinking has been part of your history, you may be looking to do specifically a liver detox. If you simply want a well-rounded detox solution for general cleansing, consider something like [Herbal Detox](https://www.cedarbear.com/products/herbal-detox) which supports multiple systems. Whatever detox supplement you choose, always follow the manufacturer's guidelines about dosage and administration. For example, [Kidney Clear's](https://www.cedarbear.com/products/kidney-clear) suggested use is to take 1.23 mL (\u00bc teaspoon) 2 to 3 times daily or as needed. As always, it is best to discuss any detox product with a medical professional to make sure it is safe for you personally and to not do detox programs while pregnant or nursing Are Detox Supplements Safe for Kids and Pets? While it is important to talk to your pediatrician or veterinarian first, well-selected detox supplements can be safe for both children and pets.
