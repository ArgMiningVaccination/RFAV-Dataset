Healthcare utilization Visit diagnoses Common new symptoms and conditionsBackground Number and type of visits, hospitalizations and common specialty referralsObjectivesMethods Data: Kaiser Permanente GA (KPGA) electronic health care records of 4,646 adults who tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 April 2020March 2021 Inclusion criteria : Laboratory -confirmed SARS -CoV-2 infected non-pregnant adults nothospitalized in first 28 days after initial diagnosis (n = 3,171) Continuous enrollment in KPGA in the 12 months prior to AND 180 days after first positive SARS -CoV-2 test Diagnoses : 3-letter ICD-10 diagnostic codes 12-month (prior to date of diagnosis) retrospective review to determine which ICD -10 codes were newMethods Analysis : Health care utilization related to pre -existing (underlying conditions) or new diagnoses in 1 -6 months after SARS -CoV-2 infection New problem visit (based on primary visit diagnosis) New specialist visit (based on 12 -month retrospective lookback) Frequency of pre -existing and new diagnoses (ICD -10 codes), and diagnosis visit rates over time COVID -19-related Symptoms potentially related to COVID -19 Other conditions65% 1 visit (n=2,171)No visitsAmong 3,171 non -hospitalized adults, 69% had 1 outpatient visits 1-6 months after infection. No visits 69% (n=2,177)The proportion of adults with 1 visit was significantly higher among those : aged 65 years (88%) vs. 18 -49 years (66%) women (76%) vs. men (59%) non-Hispanic Black adults (71%) vs. adults of any other race/ethnicity (68%) 3 underlying health conditions (83%) vs no underlying conditions (60%) and 1\u20142 (69%) underlying conditionsResults65% 1 visit (n=2,171)No visitsAmong adults with outpatient visits, 68% had a new primary diagnosis visit and 38% had a new specialist referral . Median visits 2 (interquartile range 1 -4) 1.5% hospitalized 28 days after diagnosis (for any reason) 75% evaluated by primary care Common potentially COVID -related specialty visits: dermatology, behavioral health, gastroenterology, cardiology, pulmonologyVisit rates decreased during the 28180 -day period for COVID -19 and symptoms potentially related to COVID -19 and remained stable for other common conditions. 0510152025 COVID-19 Dyspnea Throat/chest pain Cough Palpitations Fatigue Back -days 28-59 days 60-119 days 120-180 daysPatients, clinicians, and health systems should be aware ofpotential for post -COVID conditions, also known as long COVID Adults not initially hospitalized for COVID -19 may present months after diagnosis for symptoms potentially related to COVID -19 Awareness among clinicians and health systems is important to ensure patient needs are met Validating patient experience Monitoring for improvement and new conditions or complications More research needed regarding risk factors Include diverse racial/ethnic groups and examine differences by sex and race/ethnicity to guide health care planning and estimates of health care utilizationResources Health Care Utilization and Clinical Characteristics of Nonhospitalized Adults in an Integrated Health Care System 28-180 Days After COVID -19 Diagnosis \u2014Georgia, May 2020 - March 2021 | MMWR (cdc.gov)For more contact CDC 1-800-CDC-INFO (232 -4636) TTY: 1 -888-232-6348 www.cdc.gov The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
