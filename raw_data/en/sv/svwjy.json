Apologies for mobile formatting. Etc. I know a few of you might disagree, I'm not here to debate, just vent based on my experience and maybe save you some money. Naturopaths suck you in when your back is up against the wall, when you're most desperate for answers or treatment. Almost nothing is scientifically valid. Weak studies will be used to come up with expensive treatment protocols that do nothing. Testing is negative with your doctor? Here, I know a lab that does 'better' testing and will come back positive. And here's another expensive treatment protocol. That protocol didn't work? Must be comorbities. Must be mold. Must be Lyme. Must be candida. Here's a 17 part treatment protocol where you'll inject colloidal silver via an enema with single origin coffee and lemon water twice a day.Makes you feel worse? That's herxheimer, it must be working. I'm gonna refer a chiropractor as well. You'll need to be on these 8 supplements for 6 months before you feel a difference and even then, it'll take time. Oh don't buy them online, our supplements are better quality. Not working yet? Time for special red UV lights and IV bags full of vitamins. Oh yes, it's very expensive. But what cost can you put on your health? At what point do we realize how stupid this is? I've known a naturopath personally and dated another. Did you know they have a marketing class in their schooling that teaches them their target market is middle aged women? These women are most likely to do the treatment and have the most disposable income. And I didn't even experience the craziest shit that people do with these alternative treatments. NONE OF IT FUCKING WORKS! You know how I know? Because the best case result I've ever heard anywhere is 'it seems to be helping' NEVER 'it cured me, I feel normal again' People are scared and need something to believe in. I get it. Having a health issue that nobody can fix is scary. The Naturopath industry preys on this, they offer hope and a high price tag but nothing else. ND's know how we've all been treated and gaslit by MD's and they are taught to listen and offer hope. You don't need a marketing and sales class if any of this stuff actually works, cause. it. Will. Literally. Sell itself!!! Also fuck you Lightning process and Gupta and any other Asshole who is selling snake oil. Now I'm all worked up and need to go get my chakras aligned. Can someone "}
