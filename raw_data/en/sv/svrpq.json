Boosting your immune system's strength is something we should all strive for. Spinal adjustments can fix misalignment of the spine that directly causes neural dysfunction, and neural dysfunction puts stress on the body as a whole. This can lead to your immune system being weakened. Which consequently leads to the body's poor response to a foreign body, such as a cold virus. Organs that have a strong relationship with the immune system, such as the lymph nodes and the spleen, communicate with your brain and nerves, and if your nervous system isn't functioning at an optimal level, a communication breakdown can occur. You can imagine what may happen next. Getting a chiropractic adjustment is a great place to start so you can get any spinal misalignment you may have corrected. Even one adjustment can bring about an immediate immune boost. Here are some other methods to help you in boosting your immune system.
