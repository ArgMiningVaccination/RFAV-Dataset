Older adults, individuals 65 years of age and older, are disproportionately affected by influenza. In 2009 a high-dose influenza vaccine was licensed for use in older adults. The efficacy and effectiveness of this influenza vaccine have been and continue to be studied today, in 2015. However, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the body primarily responsible for developing recommendations on how to use vaccines to control disease in the United States, recommends that older adults receive an influenza vaccine and does not distinguish between the standard-dose and high-dose vaccines. Given the growing body of research around the high-dose influenza vaccine, this literature review seeks to identify the efficacy of the high-dose influenza vaccine in older adults as well as facilitators and barriers to influenza vaccination among older adults.
