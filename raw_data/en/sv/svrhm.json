Anti-aging methods with acupuncture include improving the face-related organs, and preventing the skin from sagging by performing acupuncture on the related acupoints of the directly associated face. [Natalie Ramsey](/Expert/3662693-Natalie-Elizabeth-Ramsey)Acupuncturist Montclair, New Jersey Yes, for a few reasons. Research has proven that there is an increase in collagen production at needle injection sites, so this would have an anti-aging effect on the areas that have been needled. Aside from this Acupuncture regulates hormones that may be out of balance, causing more emotional and/or oxidative stress on the body, as well as the visible side effects of stress. It also improves circulation and deliverance of vitamins and other nutrients to the body's tissues, maintaining a level a hydration and nourishment that may otherwise be strained. [Christie Luu](/Expert/82735254-Christie-Luu)Acupuncturist Westminster, CA Yes. [Kim Peirano](/Expert/82735214-Kim-Peirano)Acupuncturist San Rafael, CA Hi! I am going to assume this question is in regard to cosmetic anti-aging? I am a specialist and educator in Cosmetic Facial Acupuncture <https://www.lionsheartwellness.com/cosmetic-acupuncture.html> and happy to help. Acupuncture works for anti-aging, or more accurately - to improve the appearance and reduce signs of aging, like wrinkles, dullness and lack of vibrance in the face and body; in a variety of ways. I call this the 4 Pillars of Holistic Anti-Aging Skincare. #1: It helps stimulate Fibroblasts in the Connective Tissue: This action is what triggers the production of collagen and elastin. By needling the skin the body experiences a 'micro' trauma, and the reply to that is the activation of fibroblasts to repair the 'damage' which is done with elastin, collagen and other substances which are also the components of youthful looking skin. In this respect we can 'spot treat' certain wrinkles to direct this function which helps soften and decrease the appearance of wrinkles. #2: It stimulates and relaxes muscles in the face: We have a lot of muscles in the face and as we age they contribute to undesirable features in 2 ways: by being too contracted or being too relaxed. Too much contraction creates wrinkles, and these muscles need to be relaxed, this is what Botox does, but acupuncture has a real strong point in relaxing muscles, this is also why it helps relieve pain in the body so well. Muscles that are too relaxed become this way with age, we lose muscle mass and tone and this contributes to sagging appearance, like droopy eyelids or under the chin skin. Acupuncture can help trigger the relaxed muscles to re-engage thus lifting the skin with it. #3: It doesn't cause harm: Acupuncture is a minimally invasive treatment that really can't be 'overdone' there is no risk in looking weird after a cosmetic acupuncture session, and the treatment itself doesn't damage the skin. Some treatments that are done medically, like laser resurfacing, IPL and chemical peels actually damage the skin over time - doing so breaks down the connectivity in the skin layers and will cause crepey wrinkles later on, acupuncture and needling in general do not pose this risk #4: It treat the Whole Person: This is the most important piece, because what's happening in our body-mind-spirit shows up on our face. If digestion, sleep, stress, pain, underlying disease are at play, we won't see good results no matter what we do - but acupuncture helps to simultaneously treat these underlying causes of poor skin health and appearance. By treating the whole person we also integrate the spirit into the body - in Chinese medicine this is a crucial component of beauty because our spirit shows up through the eyes. An acupuncture treatment has also been shown to shift brainwave patterns which contributes to increased telomere lifespan - telomeres are responsible for cell integrity and death - when they break down the cell dies. This function on telomeres also contributes to general anti-aging and cognitive awareness and is why acupuncture can be a helpful treatment in stroke rehab and dementia. Hope that helps!

Dr Kim LONG BEACH, CA I had a patient come in who honestly looked to be in her 60's...problem was she was in her 30's! After her first facial aesthetic acupuncture treatment, her own sister thought she'd had Botox! The effects were astounding! So, yes! It can work! Be ready for fine needles in your face! Also, try face yoga for added effects! [Ramona Whan](/Expert/271147-Ramona-Whan)Acupuncturist Wildomar, CA Many acupuncturists, myself included, offer facial rejuvenation treatments to help fight against aging. [Dr. Hongjie Zhu](/Expert/642811-Hongjie-Zhu)Acupuncturist Lake Mary, FL Yes [Gigi Badila Cristache](/Expert/81300862-Gigi-Badila-Cristache)Acupuncturist Commerce Township, MI Acupuncture can help keep the entire body in balance and thus prevent disease. It is also good for facial and neck rejuvenation by naturally increasing blood flow and collagen production. Another very effective facial rejuvenation method is through facial cupping. [Natalia Manko](/Expert/82736337-Natalia-Manko)Acupuncturist Torrance, CA Yes, acupuncture helps with anti-aging by improving blood circulation and metabolism in the organs and joints. [Yolanda Seliga](/Expert/82736151-Yolanda-Seliga)Acupuncturist Park Ridge, IL Hello and thank you for your question! Facial, or Cosmetic Acupuncture, increases blood and nutrient circulation to an area and stimulates the production of collagen and elastin, thereby reducing redness and inflammation, smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, and reducing any facial tension. You will likely receive body acupuncture points (or constitutional points) in order to improve overall health and well-being, which will also enhance the effects of facial acupuncture. [Poyuan (Kevin) Hou](/Expert/81726967-Poyuan-Kevin-Hou)Acupuncturist Pomona, CA Acupuncture can help with anti-aging. We should say slow down the aging process. [Phranque Wright](/Expert/81225847-Phranque-Wright)Acupuncturist Chicago, IL There really is no such thing as \"anti-aging\" we cannot actually prevent ourselves from getting older. Cells go through the process of birth, growth, decline, etc as do all living things. So, what I think you're asking is can acupuncture keep me looking young. To that, I would say, it can in certain ways. It can help you feel more relaxed and hopeful, it can help you become less tired in your life and it can help reduce stress in your life, which leads to body wear and tear. However, it does not do it on it's own. You must also learn how stress factors affect you, how sleep and eating habits affect you, how your relationships (current and past) affect you and how to deal with life on a day-to-day basis. Health care is not a one-dimensional factor, acupuncture and Chinese medicine helps with the dimensions of physical, emotional, psychological and spiritual in many ways. You would need to find a good practitioner who is well trained and a Licensed Acupuncturist (not a chiropractor, MD or PC who \"also does needling\"). They should be able to talk with you deeply about your life and health and guide you towards your goals. But remember that there is wisdom in age that is stable with time and youth is fleeting, so we all need to become content with who we are growing to become and worry less about matters of what we were. Good luck with you on your journey. So, what I think you're asking is can acupuncture keep me looking young. To that, I would say, it can in certain ways.

[Daisy Dong](/Expert/1916920-Daisy-Dong)Acupuncturist Denver, CO Yes, the principle of acupuncture is to regular bleed flow locally and distally. [Jinhua Qian](/Expert/82220209-Jinhua-Qian)Acupuncturist Windsor Mill, MD Yes, acupuncture works for it through tiny needles on the face. It also makes skin bright and rejuvenate. [Ms. Qin Milla Mu](/Expert/2479613-Qin-Milla-Mu)Acupuncturist San Jose, CA Yes, it does! It can make a person slim and younger. [Andrea Cillo](/Expert/81226399-Andrea-Cillo)Acupuncturist Bay Shore, New York Yes. For this though, you want to make sure you are seeing an acupuncturist who specializes in skin care and facial rejuvenation techniques. [Mozart Paiva](/Expert/82735205-Mozart-Paiva)Acupuncturist Baltimore-Nottingham, MD Yes, it does. Be well, be confident, we can help. Be well, be confident, we can help. [Jeff Rippey](/Expert/81225813-Jeff-Rippey)Acupuncturist Saint Joseph, MO A lot depends on what you mean by \"anti-aging\". There are providers who focus on things like cosmetic or facial acupuncture. These folks are very good at helping with skin elasticity and reducing or eliminating lines and wrinkles. Acupuncture can be an excellent choice for managing the various joint aches and pains which sometimes accompany the aging process. In general though, Chinese medicine focuses more on helping a person harmonize with their current life stage rather than trying to turn the clock back.
