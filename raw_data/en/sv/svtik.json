Secondary : The secondary objectives of this study include: Efficacy of A -101 45% in the treat ment of recurrent and/or further treatments for new warts Duration of response of A -101 45% Onset of action of A -101 45% Study Design: This is a phase 3, open label, long term safety study of A -101 Topical Solution 45% in subjects with common warts. Inc. Protoc ol Number: A -101-WART -303 Protocol: Version 3: 14 February 2019 7 In order to be eligible for A -101-WART -303, subjects must have completed protocol treatment on either the A -101-WART -301 or A -101-WART -302 study. Subjects that have complete clearance of all warts at the end of A -101-WART -301 or A -101- WART 302 may enter i nto the A -101-WART -303 study following completion of the Visit 1 assessments. These subjects will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or development of new common warts. If a recurrence occurs or a new wart develops these subjects may re turn to the investigational site to receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for an additional 8 weeks. Subjects that have warts that have not cleared at the completion of A -101-WART -301 or A - 101-WART 302 may enter into the A -101-WART -303 study f ollowing completion of the Visit 1 assessments and will receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for 8 weeks. If at the completion of the initial 8 -week treatment course with A -101 Topical Solution 45% the identified warts are not clear, s ubjects m ay continue to receive repeated 8 -week treatment course with A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week. The final 8- week treatment course must be initiated by Day 122. Safety will be evaluated based on clinical laboratory studies (hematology and clinical chemistry), assessment of local skin reactions (LSRs), assessment of adverse events (AEs), and concomitant medication review. Efficacy will be evaluated based on assessment of each identified common wart according to the Physician Wart Assessment (PWA) scale. The Investigator should NOT refer to any other assessments or previous assessments to assist with this evaluation.

INTRODUCTION 4.1. Summary Warts are benign proliferations of the skin and mucosa that are caused by infection of keratinocytes by subtypes of the huma n Cutaneous HPV subtypes are a subset of this large group of the DNA papillomavirus family that is ca pable of infecting humans and causing cutaneous lesions. HPVs are ubiquitous in the environment and infection occurs most co mmonly through direct contact with individuals who harbor the virus clinically (evident lesions) or sub- clinically, indirectly throu gh exposure to contaminated surfaces, or even by autoinoculation of virus from individual lesions to adjacent uninfected ski n. Cutaneous manifestations of HPV infection include common warts (verruca vulgaris), palmar and plantar warts, mosaic warts, flat w arts, and butcher's warts. Common warts are generally small, rounded, hyperkeratotic, exophytic dome -shaped papules or nodul es and are typically associated with HPV subtypes 1, 2 or 4 though other subtypes are reported. Lesions are most commonly located on the fingers (including periungual and subungual regions), dorsal surfaces of the hands, and sites prone to trauma ( e.g., knees, elbows), but commonly occur at virtually any other anatomical location, potentially spreading by autoinoculation from the finge r/hand lesions . In immunocompetent individuals, many common cutaneous warts (up to 2/3rds in some reports) may spontaneously resolve in less than 2 years. However, they often persist for many years, may be large and/or cosmetically unsightly ( e.g., face, h ands), spread to distant anatomical regions by autoinoculation, be painful and/or prone to trauma, and, importantly, provide a significant reservoir of HPV infection in the community, placing (especially immunocompromised) individuals at risk for significa nt morbidity . There are currently no specific antiviral therapies available to treat cutaneous HPV infection and there is no FDA -approved topical treatment for cutaneous common warts. Existing therapies, many of which are off -label uses of drugs approved f or other indications, and many of which have never undergone the drug approval process, are of unproven safety and/or effic acy, and are generally directed towards either the direct physical destruction of the lesions with locally destructive or ablative m odalities such as cryotherapy, electrosurgery, curettage, application of acids ( e.g., salicylic acid, trichloroacetic acid); locally cytotoxic therapies, such as topical podophyllin, -fluorouracil, dibutyl e ster) or lesion removal. Several of these therapies are also available as over -the-counter (OTC) wart therapies in l esser exposures than used in the office setting ( e.g., topical salicylic acid preparations, home freezing kits). Systemic therapy with agents such as cimetidine, and even local occlusion with duct tape have also been anecdotally reported to be effective in some cases. While these methods may achieve cure in some cases, many require multiple visits to a physician's office, and may require provi ders with specialized training and the use of expensive equipment. Such procedures can be painful, may require anest hesia and/or analgesia, and they can be complicated by adverse cosmetic outcomes including scarring at the treatment site, as well as the ty pical post -surgical risks of bleeding and infection. No one therapy is consistently effective in all cases and, in f act, there is great variability among practitioners in the methods employed using each of these techniques with great variability of the results. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protoc ol Number: A -101-WART -303 Protocol: Version 3: 14 February 2019 19 Hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) is a compound that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is the simplest peroxide and a potent oxidizing agent commonly used in innumerable household goods including chlorine -free bleaches, general -purpose cleaning products, a nd disinfectants. Additionally, H 2O2 has been employed as the oxidizing component in hair dyes, and has been used in oral hygiene products and tooth- whitening systems for many years. In industry, it is employed in the treatment of wastewater. In high concentrations, it is used in bleaching paper, pulp, and textiles. Clinically, in addition to its use as an oral topical agent noted above, H 2O2 is widely employed at low concentrations ( e.g., 3% -6%) as a wound irrigant and topical antiseptic/disinfectant, and has been in use medicinally since its introduction into clinical practice by Richardson in 1858. ( Schumb, 1955) (Chan, 2008) (Richardson, 1866) (Richardson, 1891) (Watt, 2004) ( Zonios, 2007) . H2O2 is an important oxidizing agent in biological systems. The local deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species on the skin are mitigated by the presence of a complex antioxidant defense system that includes, enzymes such as catalase, e, superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin as as non-enzymatic components including ascorbic acid, urates and uric acid, tocopherol, glutathione, ubiquinones, ubiquinol and other -soluble groups. The local application of supra - physiologic concentrations of H 2O2 may overwhelm the antioxidant defense systems in the skin, allowing H 2O2 to act not only through its direct oxidation of organic tissues, generation of reactive oxygen species, and local lipid peroxidation, but also by the generation of local concentrations of O 2 that are toxic to the abnormal lesional (seborrheic keratosis) cells . 4.2. Study Rationale The rationale for the dose selection and treatment design of A -101-WART 301 and A-101-WART -302 and this open label, long term safety study is based on data collected from three completed (3) Phase 2 studies which assessed dose response and dose frequency of A -101 (H2O2) Topical Solution in patients with common warts. All three studies demonstrated good efficacy and safety of H 2O2 45% for the treatment of common warts. The three studies conducted are identified below and they represent data collected from 406 subjects. Study A -101-WART -201: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle- Controlled, Parallel - Group, Study of A -101 Solution in Subjects with Common Warts (n=90). Study A -101-WART -202: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel Group Study of A -101 Topical Solution Applied Once a Week in Subjects with Co mmon Warts (n=157). Study A -101-WART -203: A Randomized, Double -Blind, Vehicle -Controlled, Parallel Group Study of A -101 Topical Solution Applied Twice a Week in Subjects with Common Warts (n=159) Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protoc ol Number: A -101-WART -303 Protocol: Version 3: 14 February 2019 20 On the basis of these successful Phase II studies, Aclaris has progressed to phase III with studies A-101-WART 301 and A -101-WART -302. These studies will assess efficacy and safety of 8 weeks of treatment and 12 weeks of post treatment follow up. Aclaris recognizes that many patients may require multiple treatme nt courses and there is therefore a need to assess the long - term safety of topical H 2O2 45%. A -101-WART -303 is therefore designed to assess the long- term safety of patients who were initially treated in studies A -101-WART -301 and A Version 3: 14 February 2019 21 5. OBJECTIV ES 5.1. Study Objectives 5.1.1. Primary Objective The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term safety of A -101 45% when applied twice weekly to common warts . 5.1.2. Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of this study include: Efficacy of A -101 45% in the treatment of recurrent and/or further treatments for new warts Duration of response of A -101 45% Onset of action of A Protocol: Version 3: 14 February 2019 22 6. STUDY DESIGN This is a phase 3, open label, long term safety study of A-101 Topical Solution 45% in subjects with commo n warts . In order to be eligible for A -101-WART -303, s ubjects must have completed protocol treatment on either the A -101-WART -301 or A -101-WART -302 study . Subjects that have complete clearance of all warts at th e end of A -101-WART -301 or A -101- WART 302 ma y enter into the A -101-WART -303 study following completion of the Visit 1 assessments. These subjects will be followed every 6 weeks to assess for a recurrence or development of new common warts. If a recurrenc e occurs or a new wart develops these subjec ts may return to the investigational site to receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for an additional 8 weeks . Subjects that have warts that have not cleared (or were not treated) at the completion o f A-101- WART -301 or A -101-WART 302 may enter into the A -101-WART -303 study following completion of the Visit 1 assessments will receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for 8 weeks. Subjects may continue to receive A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for 8 weeks if their warts are not clear at the end of the 8 -week treatment period but the 8 weekly treatments must be initiated by Day 1 22.

Identification of Common Warts Subjects who have completed participation in the A -101-WART 301 or A -101-WART -302 study are eligible to enroll into the A -101-WART - 303 study . Subjects that were previously treated on the double - blind phase 3 study whose warts have recurred , were not treated or who develop new warts during the observation period of A -101-WART - 303 are also eligible to receive treatment with A -101 Topical Solution 45% twice a week for 8 weeks. A n 8-week treatment period may begin anytime between Day 1 and Day 1 22. Warts that are identifie d by the treating investigator must meet the following criteria: Subject may have 1 wart and up to 6 common warts treated during a n 8-week treatment period Identified warts must have a longest axis of 8 mm. Be a discrete lesion, i.e. each wart meeting the entry criteria must be clearly separated from other warts Not be a periungual, subungual, genital, anal, mosaic, plantar, flat or filiform wart Not be in an intertriginous fold Not be covered with hair which, in the Investigator's opinion, would interfere with the study medication treatments or the study evaluations Not be in an area that may be occluded ( e.g., by clothing or footwear or in a skin fold) . Each identified wart will be identified on the body charts in the subject's eCRF. 9.2. Common Wart Dimensions and Physician's Wart Assessment (PWA) Each identified wart that will be treated with A -101 study medication will be measured using the Aclaris supp lied ruler. The longest axis of each identified wart will be documented on the subject's eCRF. The Physician's Wart Assessment (PWA) is the Investigator's assessment of the severity of each identified common wart at a particular time -point. The Investig ator should NOT refer to any other assessments to assist with this evaluation. This evaluation IS NOT a comparison with the PWA performed at any other visit. During an 8- week treatment period, subjects will have their identified warts assessed using the PWA at the following time -points: Day 1, Day 29, Day 60 and Day 182. The Investigator will assess each identified common wart and report the one integer that best describes the common wart severity using the following scale.Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 32 Physician's Wart Assessment Grade Descri ptor 0 Clear: No visible wart. No further treatment is indicated 1 Near Clear: a visible wart that is less than 3 mm in maximal diameter (or length) 2 A visible wart 3 mm and < 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length) 3 A visible wart 6 mm in maximal diameter (or length) The physician is encouraged to use a ruler or caliper and to feel the wart or skin area to help his/her assessment. Common warts that are assessed by the investigator as having cleared (PWA =0) will be instructed not to continue to apply the A -101 study medication. Refer to Appendix 2 for the PWA Site Manual. 9.3. Phone Call Visits Subjects that are enrolled t o the study that do not have any identified warts to be treated will complete the Visit 1 (can be the same day as V13 of A-101-WART -301 or A -101-WART -302) assessment in the office and then will have telephone contact visits on Day 42, Day 84, and Day 126. During these calls site staff will ask the subject if they have any adverse events that they feel are related to their previous treatment with A -101 Topical Solution and if they have had a new wart develop or if they have had a recurrence of a wart that was previously treated on the A - 101-WART 301 or A -101-WART 302 study. If a subject has a new wart or a recurrence they can be scheduled for an in -office visit and initiate treatment on another 8 -week treatment period with A -101 study medication. If an 8- week treatment period is started then all assessments outlined in Table 2 must be followed. A subject cannot start an 8- week treatment period after study Day 122. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 37 10.7. Applying Study Medication All subjects that are between the ages of 1 and 17 will have their A -101 study medica tion applied by a parent/legal guardian . Parents/legal guardians of children must ensure that the child does not put the treated area in their mouth, or eyes, until completely dry after the application. If the treated area is not completely dry 10 minutes after th e application, the area should be blotted dry. Subjects 18 years of age and older will apply their A -101 study medication to his/her identified common warts . Study medication will be applied in the office on Day 1 and Day 29 prior to the PWA b eing per forme d. The following instructions will be used by all subjects/parents/legal guardians applying A -101 study medication to all identified common warts : Do not apply the study medications to eyes, nose, mouth, mucous membranes, or open wounds Thoroughly cleanse the common wart by firmly rubbing with a swab/wipe wetted with 70% isopropyl alcohol Using firm pressure and with the tip of the applicator held over the wart, squeeze in the middle of the applicator to apply one drop of study medication onto the c ommon wart . Using the smaller side of the applicator tip, move the applicator around in a circular motion to fully saturate the lesion. Apply the study medication for approximately 15 seconds. Minimize exposure to the surrounding norm al skin During the treatment process remove excess study medication from the surrounding skin using a clean absorbent wipe . Ensure the i dentified common wart is fully saturated with study medication at the end of the ~15 second application Allow the treated wart to remain u ndisturbed for ~15 seconds After ~15 seconds repeat the ~15 second application process Repeat the application/waiting cycle until the study medication has been applied to each identified Wart up to 3 times. If severe erythema and edema develop, then the tr eatment cycle should be discontinued for that specific treatment application. Absorb any remaining A -101 study medication and dry the commo n wart and the surrounding skin without wiping or rubbing. 10.8.

If the treated area is not completely dry 10 minutes after the application, the area should be blotted dry. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 42 12. ASSESMENT OF SAFETY In addition to reporting adverse events throughout the study the investigator, a designated and appropriately trained staff member or the subject, will perform the following safety as sessments according to the schedules noted below . 12.1. Local Skin Reactions (LSRs) The LSR assessment is the Investigator's assessment of the signs and the subj ect's assessment of the symptoms associated with irritation at the identified common wart site ( i.e., the common wart and the skin immediately surrounding the common wart exposed to study medication). The Local Skin Reaction signs to be assessed are: Eryth ema Edema Erosion Ulceration Vesicles/bullae Excoriations Scabbing The Local Skin Reactio n symptoms to be assessed (by the Subject) are: Stinging/burning Pruritus (itch) The Investigator will evaluate the LSR signs at the each identified common wart site as follows: At visits where a study medication treatment or retreatment is performed: o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application and The Subject will assess the LSR symptoms at the identified common wart site as follows: At visits w here a study medication treatment or retreatment is performed: o Perform an LSR assessment prior to any study medication application At visits where NO study medication treatment is performed: o Perform an LSR assessment. Subjects are to remain in the clinic f or 20 minutes after the application of their study medication. Any local skin reactions or other adverse experiences that occur during this time period must be Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 43 documented as an adverse event. The Investigator and Subject should report the one integer t hat best describes the severity of each LSR sign or LSR symptom for the common wart site using the scale below:Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 44 Local Skin Reactions Grade Descriptor 0 None OR No signs or symptoms present. 1 Asymptomatic or mild symptoms OR clinical or diagnostic obse rvations only OR intervention not indicated. 2 Moderate OR minimal , local or noninvasive intervention indicated. 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening OR disabling OR limiting self -care of activities of daily living. . 12.2. Clinical Laboratory Sampling Subjects that do not have their Visit 1 the same day as Visit 13 of either A -101-WART 301 or A - 101-WART 302 will have to have a clinical chemistry and CBC performed. Non -fasting blood samples for clinical laboratory analysis wi ll be collected by a qualifi ed staff member on Day 182 for all subjects. Approximately 7.5 mL of blood will be collected for each chemistry sample and 3 ml of blood will be collected for each complete blood count (CBC). These blood samples will be sent to a central laboratory for an alysis. Refer to the study specific laboratory manual for instructions regarding handling of the blood samples and shipping instructions. The following tests, at a minimum, will be conducted: Chemistry Panel Complete Blood Cou (AST) Red blood cell morphology Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) Red blood cell count Bicarbonate White blood cell count Calcium White blood cell differential Chloride % & absolute Creatinine Basophils Protocol Number: A- Lymphocytes Total protein Uric acid The results of the clinical laboratory tests will be reported on the central laboratory's standard reports. These laboratory results will be sent to the investigator via fax. The investigator must review all laboratory reports in a timely manner and note NC S or CS to define the clinical relevance of any result that is outside the normal range for the laboratory. The investigator must date and initial every laboratory report. The investigator must report all laboratory results that are BOTH outside the normal range for the laboratory AND, in the opinion of the investigator, CS as medical history if found prior to the first study medication treatment or as an AE if found after the first study medication treatment begins.

Adve rse Events (AEs) An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study of a pharmaceutical product and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of the study, or significant worsening of the disease under study (or any concu rrent disease), whether or not considered related to the study drug. Accordingly, an adverse event could include any of the following : intercurrent illnesses ; physical injuries ; events possibly related to concomitant medication ; significant worsening (cha nge in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre -existing conditions. (N OTE: A condition, recorded as pre -existing, that is intermittently symptomatic [e.g., headache] and which occurs during the study should be recorded as a n adverse event ); Drug interactions; Events occurring during diagnostic procedures or any washout phase of the study; laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities occurring after the start of the study (i.e., after screening and once confirmed by repeat tes ting) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, requires medical treatment or further diagnostic work -up, or is considered by the study investigator to be clinically significant. N OTE: Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events, but will be recorded to monitor data from patients who do not meet screening criteria . The investigator must, for any common wart related AE, question the subject in detail to determine if there are any confounding factors ( e.g., irritation by clothing or activity, sunburn) for any such AE . The investigator should, when certain, report a diagnosis rather than the signs, symptoms or clinicall y relevant abnormal laboratory values associated with the AE. Otherwise, signs, symptoms or abnormal laboratory values may be used to describe the AE . Any C S abnormality discovered prior to the first study medication treatment s hould be reported as medical history, not as an AE . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 47 13.1.2. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) A Serious Adverse Event is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: Results in death; Is life threatening; Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization; Result s in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or Is an important medical event. The term \"life threatening\" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject is admitted to the hospital on an in -patient basis, even if released the sam e day. Prolongation of hospi talization is defined as an additional night stay in the hospital. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Important medical events are those that may not be immediately life threatening, result in death or hospitalization, but are clearly of major clinical significance and may jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the SAE definition above. Thes e should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. 13.1.3. Adverse Event Reporting Period The investigator must start re porting non- serious AEs starting with the subject's first study medication tr eatment continuing until the subject's last study visit. Non- serious adverse events that occur between the time the subject was consent ed and the first application of study medication will be reported as medical history . Reporting for SAEs begins after the subject signs the informed consent and continues until the subject's last study visit (regardless of relationship to study medication). If a subject experiences a SAE after the subject's last study visit, that is deemed by the investigator to be related to study medication, the investigator must report this to the Sponsor using the study specific SAE report form . 13.1.4. Severity The investigator must define the severity of each AE using the following definitions as a guideline. The investigator will consider the range of the possible severity of the event and identify the severity that is the mos t appropriate according to her/his medical judgment. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 48 Mild - Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated Moderate - Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity Severe - Incapacitating with inability to perform usual activity. 13.1.5. Relati onship to Study Medication The investigator will determine if there is a reasonable causal relationship between the study medication and an AE or not. The investigator will use her/his best medical judgment and consider all relevant factors ( e.g., temporal relationship, location of the event, the subject's relevant medical history, concomitant the rapies and concurrent conditions) to determine the relationship of the AE to the study medication. The investigator will define the relationship of an AE to the st udy medication by selecting one of the following categories . Related - There is a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE. Not Related - There is not a reasonable possibility that there is a causal relationship between the study medication and the AE . The term \"reasonable causal relationsh ip\" means there are facts or arguments to suggest a causal relationship (International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) E2A . 13.2. Reporting Procedures 13.2.1. Procedures for Reporting Adverse Events At each post enrollment visit, the investigator or designee will ques tion the subject to elicit AEs using a non- directive question such as \"Has there been any change in your health since the previous study visit?\" The Investigator/designee will monitor the subject for at least 20 minutes after the Treatment Completion Time at any visit during which a study medication treatment is performed to elicit AEs in a similar man ner. If appropriate, based on the subject's response to non- directed questioning regarding AEs, the investigator or designee will follow -up with directed questions and appropriate evaluations . Any AE noted during the reporting period must be reported in the source documents and on the appropriate AE CRF . AEs that are defined as \"Not Related\" to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or until the subject's last study visit. AEs that are defined as \"Related\" to the study medications will be followed until they are resolved or, if not resolved after the subject's last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator, the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequelae . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 49 13.2.2. Procedure for Reporting Serious Ad verse Events Upon becoming aware of a SAE occurring during the AE reporting period, whether or not related to the study medications, the investigator must: 1. Take the appro priate medical action to ensure the subject's safety 2. Immediately inform th e Aclaris of the SAE by entering the event in to the Axiom database. If the Axiom database is unavailable, the site must fax a provided paper SAE form to Aclaris at the number below : Serious Adverse Event Facsimile: 484 -324-2359 3. Within 24- hours of becoming aware of the event, a SAE report form, an AE CRF and any other relevant information ( e.g., concomitant medication CRF, medical history CRF, laboratory test results) must be enter ed in to the Axiom database . 4. Monitor and document the progress of the SAE until it resolves or, if not resolved after the subject's last study visit, until in the opinion of the investigator the AE reaches a clinically stable outcome with or without sequel ae AND the investigator and Drug Safety Monitor agree that the SAE is satisfactorily resolved. 5. Inform the Drug Safety Monitor of SAE updates by telephone followed by an SAE form update entered in to the Axiom database . Comply with the appropriate regulator y requirements and Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. instructions regardi ng reporting of the SAE to the responsible Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) . 13.2.3. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be w ithdrawn from study drug at any time at the discretion of the inve stigator. If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time. The patient will be monitored until the event has resolved or stabilized, unti l a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made, or until the patient is referred to the care of a local health care professional. The investigator must inform the medical monitor as soon as possible of all patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must be provided when requested . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 50 14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Details of all statistical summaries and analyses will be provided in the study specific Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). 14.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations The sample size is based on an estimate of how many patients will be required to provide at least 100 subjects requiring repeated treatment for a wart over the course of the study . By recruiting 400 subjects, we estimate 200 subjects will have received act ive treatment in the A101- WART 301/302 studies. We expected approximately 26% of warts treated in A -101-WART -301/302 studies to be clear at the en d of the A101- WART 301/302 studies . Based on the assumption that 26% of warts will be clear, at least 148 subj ects will require exposure to active treatment. We anticipate that some subjects originally randomized to vehicle will be expos ed to active treatm ent. As a result, the study should exceed the target of exposing more than 100 subjects to repeated treatments over the course of the study. 14.2. Analysis Populations The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population will consist of all subjects consented in the study. 14.3. Statistical Analysis of Efficacy Unless otherwise stated, all efficacy summaries and analyses will be conducted u sing the ITT population. All efficacy summaries and analyses will be produced for the following groups: Subjects treated in the study that were r andomized to active treatment during the previous A101- WART 301/302 study. Subjects treated in the study that were randomized to vehicle during the previous A101-WART 301/302 study. Subjects treated in the study overall . Subjects not requiring treatment during the study t hat were randomized to active treatment during the previous A101- WART 301/302 study. Subjects not requiring treatment during the study that were randomized to vehicle during the previous A101- WART 301/302 study. Subjects not requiring treat ment in the study overall. All subjects combined Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 51 The primary efficacy analysis will be the effectiveness of A -101 45% based on the proportion of subjects who achieve complete clearance (PWA=0) of all identified common warts at any scheduled visit . Any i dentified common wart for a subject that has missin g PWA data will be treated as not clear for the purpose of the primary efficacy analysis. Four secondary efficacy analyses will be performed: Durability of response: for warts achieving a status of Clear (PWA=0), the number of weeks the wart remains clear will be tabulated and these results will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The proportion of these warts that remain clear at the end of the study will also be prese nted. Mean per -subject p ercent of treated warts that are Clear (PWA=0) at each visit will be summarized using descriptive statistics . Proportion of subjects with a single wart at baseline whose wart is Clear (PWA=0) will be summarized using descriptive statistics by visit. Median time to achieve onset of Clearance (PWA=0) for all treated warts. Efficacy summaries will be supported by listings of PWA data. 14.4. Statistical Analysis of Safety Data Unless otherwise stated, all safety summaries will be conducted using the ITT population. All safety summaries will be produced for the following groups: Subjects treated in the study that were randomized to active treatment during the previous A101- WART 301/302 study. Subjects treated in the study that were randomized to vehicle during the previous A101- WART 301/302 study. Subjects treated in the study overall . Subjects not requiring treatment during the study that were randomized to active treatment during the previous A101- WART 301/302 s tudy. Subjects not requiring treatment during the st udy that were randomized to vehicle during the previous A101- WART 301/302 study. Subjects receiving active treatment during the study or the previous A101- WART 301/302 study . The proportion of subjects w ith treatment em ergent adverse events will be tabulated and presented by System Organ Class and Preferred Term from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Likewise , the proportion of subjects with serious AEs will be summarized. Adver se event summaries will be presented showing the pro portion of subjects experiencing adverse events, both overall and by MedDRA System Organ Class. The version of MedDRA to be used for the analysis of this study will be specified in the SAP . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 52 Local skin reaction (LSR) scores and clinically relevant abnorma l laboratory results will be tabulated and presented at the subject level. For each LSR sign and at each in -house visit, the proportion of subjects who had at least one treated wart with LSR severi ty >= 1 will be summarized. Safety summaries will be suppo rted by listings of all adverse events, laboratory results, and LSR data. 14.5. Interim Analysis No formal interim analysis will be conducted for this study. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 53 15. QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 15.1. Protocol Amendments No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by the IRB /EC, except when necessary to eliminate immediate safety concerns to the study subjects or when the change involves only logistics or adminis tration. The principal investigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment . 15.2. Protocol Violations A protocol violation is defined as any divergence from the protocol -specif ic inclusion/exclusion criteria, subject is administered a prohibited medic ation , and/or GCP guidelines . Protocol violations will be identified and recorded, by study center personnel, on the CRF . As a matter of policy, sponsor/CRO will not grant exceptio ns to protocol -specific entry criteria to allow patients to enter a study. If under extraordinary circumstances such action is considered ethically, medically, and scientifically justified for a particular patient, prior approval from sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Sponsor/CROs Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the patient will be allowed to enter the study. If investigative center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol eligibility cr iteria was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they must immediately inform sponsor/CRO. Such subjects will be discontinued from the study, except in a rare instance following review and written approval by sponsor/CRO and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP . 15.3. Training For each investigational center, there will be an initiation visit prior to enrolling any study subjects . It is strongly recommended that all investigators, other evaluators, study nurses, study coordinators or other applicable personnel attend this visit. During this visit, participants will be trained to the protocol, study specific procedures, and the CRFs. Those unable to attend the initiation visit must receive on -site training from an appr opriately trained individual prior to participating in any of the procedures and evaluations i n this study . Clinical Research Associates (CRAs) and other applicable personnel will be trained prior to study initiation to familiarize CRAs with the disease, the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol and other study specific items. Team or ganization, communication and operational issues will also be discussed . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. will provide an investigational center file to each center . 15.4. Monitoring The conduct of the study will be closely monitored by the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. study monitor /CRO to verify adherence to ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable SOPs, the protocol, other written instructions and regulatory guidelines . Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 54 The investigator will allow the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. representatives designee and/or and any regulatory agency to have direct access to all study records, CRFs, corresponding subject medical records, study medication dispensing records and study medication storage area, and any other documents considered source documentation. The i nvestigator also agrees to assist the representative, if required . 15.5. Data Management Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study . The data collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11. The CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the study before it is used to capture data from this study. Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study specific training. After they are trained, users will be provided with individual system access rights . The handling of data, including data quality ass urance, will comply with regulatory guidelines, including ICH and GCP, and the sponsor/CRO SOPs and working instructions. Data management and control processes s pecific to this study will be described in a data management plan. At the end of the study, the database will be locked and the data will be released for reporting and statistical analysis . 15.6. Quality Assurance The study is conducted under the sponsorship of Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. in compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements as wel l as applicable ICH guidelines, Helsinki Declaration, and in respect of the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. and/or sub- contractor SOPs for study conduct and monitoring . Audits may be carried out by the Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. or Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.'s representatives and inspections may be performed by regulatory authorities or IRB/ECs before, during or after the study. The investigator will provide the auditi ng/inspecting group direct access to all study records ( e.g., CRFs, subject medical records, s tudy medication dispensing records) and the investigational center study facilities. The investigator and study staff will be available and will assist the auditing/inspecting groups as appropriate . 15.7. Record Retention All pertinent data, samples, photographs , correspondence, original or amended protocol, reports and all other material relating to the study will be maintained securely in Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc./CRO /investigator archives for the legally required duration for archiving . The investigator shoul d maintain the essential study documents as specified in ICH GCP, and in compliance with all regulatory requirements. The investigator should ensure these documents are protected from accidental destruction or disposal . If the Investigator needs to re -assign responsibility for maintaining these documents ( e.g., due to retirement) it must be transferred to a person willing to accept this responsibility. The Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 55 investigator must notify Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc., in writing, of the name and address of the new i ndividual . If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the investigative site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor to store these in sealed containers in an off -site storage location so that they can be returned to the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the continued care of the patient, appropriate copies will be made for off -site storage . No trial document should be destroyed without prior written agreement between the Sponsor and the Investigator. Should the Investigator wish to assign the trial records to another party or move them to another location, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor in writing of the n ew responsible person and/or the new location. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Protocol Number: A- 101-WART -303 Protocol Version 3: 14 February 2019 56 16. ETHICS AND GENERAL S TUDY CONDUCT CONSIDERATIONS 16.1.

Approval of each such submission must be obtained from the committee before it may be used in the study and must be documented in a written notification to the Investigator specifying the protocol number, prot ocol version, documents reviewed, and date on which the committee met and granted the approval. In partic ular, each informed consent document must bear clear evidence (written, stamp, date of approval, etc.) of IRB approval before it may be presented to prospective (or ongoing, as appropriate) study patients for signature . Written evidence of the approval mus t be made available to the Sponsor. Any modifications made to the protocol and of correspondingly modified informed consent documents made after receipt of Central IRB approval must also be submitted to the committee for approval before implementation unless the modification is made on an emergency basis to protect the welfare of study patients. In the latter case, the Central IRB must be notified promptly and their written approval must be obtained as soon after the fact as possible . Appropriate reports on the progress of the study will be made to the Central IRB and the Sponsor by the Investigator in accordance with applicable regulatory regulations and in conformity with policies established by both the Central IRB and the Sponsor. The shortest time interval between required reports required by either party or by regulations will prevail . The Investigator at each investigative site, or his/her nomin ee, will be responsible for reporting any SAEs to the Central IRB as soon as possible, and in accordance w ith the guidelines of the Central IRB. The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting all serious, life threatening or fatal adverse study drug events with a causal relationship to the study drug to appropriate regulatory agencies within their required time lines . The Investigator is responsible for obtaining written, informed consent(s) from each prospective patient interested in participating in this study before performing any study -related procedures. Written informed consent must be obtained after adequate, thorough, and clear explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study, as well as any use of the patient's genetic information from the study. The Investigator must use the most current Central IRB- approved consent form for documenting written informed consent.
