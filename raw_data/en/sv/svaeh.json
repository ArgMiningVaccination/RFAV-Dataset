Although most cases of traveler's diarrhea (TD) improve within 1 to 2 days without treatment, it can make your trip very uncomfortable. [[1]](#_note-1) X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience) Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) TD is most commonly caused by viruses, parasites, and bacteria (such as E. coli), which can be found in tap water and undercooked food. While you are travelling, wash your hands frequently, choose food and drinks carefully, and try to avoid consuming tap water. If you don't have access to bottled water, disinfect the water by boiling it, filtering it, or treating it with chemicals. While avoiding contaminated food and water is the best form of prevention, you can also talk to your doctor about taking medications or getting vaccines to prevent common food-borne illnesses. [[2]](#_note-2) X Research source Steps Water and Other Beverages - 1Avoid drinking the tap water in developing countries. The tap water in developing countries in Central and South America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia may be contaminated with bacteria, parasites, and viruses. These can all cause traveler's diarrhea (TD). When visiting these areas, only drink sealed, bottled beverages like bottled water, tea, soda, beer, wine, juice, and coffee. [[3]](#_note-3)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - If the seal has been broken, choose or ask for another bottle. - Use bottled water to mix baby formula or buy pre-mixed, sealed formula. - Avoid drinking fresh fruit juice made with tap water as well. - 2Order juice, water, and alcoholic beverages without ice. Ice may be made with contaminated tap water. Once the ice cubes melt, it will be like drinking tap water, which may be contaminated. [[4]](#_note-4)X Research source - Keep in mind that the alcohol in most beverages is not strong enough to kill bacteria, viruses, and parasites. - 3Order steaming hot coffee and tea. Because boiled water is used to make hot coffee and tea, it may be safe to order these from a restaurant or caf\u00e9. However, make sure your coffee or tea is steaming hot when you receive it. If it is not, then you may want to think twice before drinking it.

You can still get TD without drinking water. If contaminated water comes into contact with your mouth while brushing your teeth, you may get TD. [[6]](#_note-6)X Research source [Tie a ribbon around the faucet to remind yourself to not use the water to brush your teeth.](#) Advertisement - Additionally, while you are showering, make sure to keep your mouth closed. Food Safety - 1Avoid eating food from street vendors. Food made by street vendors may be washed and prepared with contaminated tap water. Your risk of consuming raw or undercooked fish, shellfish, and meat is higher when eating street food as well. [[7]](#_note-7)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - 2Consume fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself. Fruits and vegetables that do not need to be peeled to eat may be cleaned and prepared with contaminated water. Examples of fruits and vegetables that you can peel yourself are bananas, oranges, avocados, kiwis, and grapefruit. [[8]](#_note-8)X Research source - Avoid eating salads, berries, grapes, tomatoes, and other fruits and veggies that do not need to be peeled to eat. Alternatively, rinse them with boiled or bottled water before eating them. - 3Eat prepared meals that are hot and cooked well. When you receive your food, make sure it is steaming. Your food should be hot to the touch and steam should be visible. Additionally, make sure meat, fish, and shellfish are cooked thoroughly. Fish and shellfish should look opaque, and meat should be firm to the touch with no pink in the middle. [[9]](#_note-9)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world's leading hospitals [Go to source](#) - Avoid foods that have been sitting out at room temperature, like buffet food and sauces. - Undercooked or raw meat and seafood may contain harmful organisms that can cause TD and other illnesses. Stick to canned seafood, like tuna, or cook the meat yourself to ensure it isn't undercooked. - 4Stick to dry and packaged foods when you can. Dry foods like chips, crackers, and bread are typically safe to eat since bacteria needs moisture to grow. Additionally, packaged and factory-sealed foods, like canned goods, are safe to eat as long as the packaging has not been opened or tampered with. [[10]](#_note-10)X Research source - 5Avoid consuming milk and dairy products. If you cannot confirm if milk or a dairy product, like cheese, is pasteurized, avoid eating it. Unpasteurized milk and dairy products may contain harmful organisms that can cause TD and other illnesses. [[11]](#_note-11)X Research source Advertisement - This includes products like ice cream, cheese, smoothies, milkshakes, and other products that contain dairy. - You can mix dry, powdered milk with bottled water, if you wish. Water Disinfection - 1Boil tap water for 1 minute. Pour the tap water into a pot. Place the pot on the burner and set the heat to high. Once the water starts to boil, after about 8 to 10 minutes, let it boil for another minute. Take the pot off the burner. Let the water cool to room temperature before drinking it. [[12]](#_note-12)X Research source - 2Use a portable gravity-drip or hand-pump microfilter. Microfilters can remove bacteria like E. coli and parasitic cysts from water. However, they may not be able to remove smaller organisms like viruses. If you need a filter that can remove viruses, use a nanofiltration or ultrafiltration system. [[13]](#_note-13)X Research source - To be as safe as possible, boil the water first, then filter it. - You can purchase water filters online or from a travel store. - 3Disinfect tap water with iodine or chlorine. Both chlorine and iodine are effective in killing viruses and bacteria and come in either tablet or liquid form for disinfecting water. Disinfect the water per the instructions on the package. [[14]](#_note-14)X Research source Advertisement - Do not use iodine for more than 3 weeks, since it can affect your thyroid function. - Pregnant women, people with an unstable thyroid disease, or people who are allergic to iodine should not use iodine. - Bring tablets for treating water with you on your trip, as they may not be available in some countries. Expert Q&A [Add New Question] [Submit] Tips - Before you travel, talk to your doctor about getting vaccines to prevent food-borne illnesses that cause diarrhea, such as hepatitis A, typhoid, or cholera. Depending on where you're traveling, they might also prescribe antimicrobial or antibiotic medications to prevent or treat diarrhea. [[15]](#_note-15)X Research source - If you get TD, avoid eating for up to 18 hours and just consume liquids. You can also take an antidiarrheal medication, such as loperamide (Imodium), along with a medication prescribed by your doctor. Avoid taking loperamide if you have other serious symptoms, like a high fever, chills, or bloody diarrhea. [[16]](#_note-16)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#) - If you have a history of TD, take 4 tablets of Pepto-Bismol a day, with food. [[17]](#_note-17)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)PubMed Central Journal archive from the U.S. National Institutes of Health [Go to source](#)However, do not take Pepto-Bismol with aspirin or other blood thinning medications. It can also interfere with some antibiotics or anti-malaria medications.

[[19]](#_note-19)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)American Academy of Family Physicians Organization devoted to improving the health of patients, families, and communities [Go to source](#) [Show More Tips](#) Warnings - If you are vomiting in addition to having diarrhea, see a doctor to prevent dehydration. - Don't give anti-diarrheal medications, such as loperamide (Imodium), to children under the age of 2. Avoid giving Pepto-Bismol to children under age 3.
