It is tasked with providing advice to the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) on matters relating to and affecting Oregon Medical Marijuana Program (OMMP) registrants. The Commission is also responsible for working in collaboration with the legislature to propose a possible governance framework for the OMMP and to create a long -term strategic plan to assure the sustainability and affordability of cannabis and that it remains a therapeuti c option for Oregonians. The Commission was also required to ensure that research on cannabis and cannabis -derived products is being conducted for public purposes. For some time now there have been calls for the OLCC to sit down with their licensees and establish a way to get no -cost products to patients, provide a wider range of resources, services and products for patients, and to subsidize some of the costs for testing and processing. The retail model as it relates to patients is unsustainable and part of the OCC's mission is to create a long -term strategic plan for cannabis pricing and availability. Retail stores provide sustainable access for patients that can afford retail prices but until we ensure patients can access , for example FECO at less tha n $3,000.00 per month, patient s requiring larger doses of higher potency products are invariably forced into options they should not have to exercise to meet their needs. The following changes, upgrades and updates are key elements to a robust patient care and accommodation plan if retail stores are to adequately serve patients. Implementing these changes will require some legislative change but many , such as recommendation 10, can be accomplished by rule change. These recommendations come out of the joint Patient Equity and Governance Frame Working Subcommittee s and are to provide an outline for creating this program with the goal of patient care and accommodation. The recommendations were part of a larger report of recommendations provided to the commission during their 04/21/21 and 07/28/21 meetings. The recommendations are to serve as a guide for the discussion between OLCC and their licensees and are based in part on survey information, in -store observations and patient contact, and review of online retail market menus relating to pricing. Joint Patient Equity and Governance Frame Working Subcommittee Report/Recommendations to the OCC - Page 2 Oregon Cannabis Commission Recommendations Possible new Recommendations: Definitions /Language Funding for OMMP, innovations, subsidizations , research , public safety , Recommendation 1 : Subsidized testing and processing for patients . Small quantity processing and the high cost of required testing puts both testing and processing out of reach for most personal growers, but both must be available for personal growers as patients and caregivers creat e self-care products. Recommend creating a structure for participating licensees to offer a sliding scale for services when participating in a cooperative effort that disperses the expense. Labs and processors could offer at cost testing every second Tuesday for instance , or for every ten tests a licensee pays for at a participating licensee, a caregiver receives a no -cost test of their edibles. Individuals who qualify for an OMMP reduced application fee (and consider adding SSDI to reduced fee) for example, this population qualifies for subsidized testing. Consider subsidization from dispensary licensing fees rather than taxes. Reinve st fees into community/industry /for benefit of the public. Allowing transfers from OMMP cardholders to OLCC processors, including OMMP grower transfers to processors and processor transfers back to OMMP patients . Recommendation 2: Collaborate with the Oregon Cannabis Commission to develop minimum guidelines for product availability and requirements for quality of products . Please see the A ddendum for an example of these guidelines and requirements. Recommendation 3: Develop annual training for OLCC licensee counter personnel in coordination with the OCC which includes : Regular evaluation to ensure counter personnel are up to date on current rules such as for example see the City of Portland CPOT team. Clear directive that counter personnel cannot provide medical advice; and Develop t raining on how to provide onsite medical resources to guide patient purchases. This could include kiosk style medical resource guide. Expand patient services in a retail setting to include, but not limited to: Clearly defined patient sections; Provide community -based education on how to safely make self -care products such as topicals, tinctures, edibles, suppositories, and FECO products. Joint Patient Equity and Governance Frame Working Subcommittee Report/Recommendations to the OCC - Page 3 Require pr oduct menu pricing model to clearly reflect product price for OMMP patients versus retail consumers. Retail licensees have incorporated tax into the menu pricing for products which causes confusion for OMMP patients. Recommendation 4: Definition refining Medical and patient centered policy: when policy and regulations center medical care and patients, laws and rules are crafted based on a sound understanding and balance of historical natural practices, traditional indigenous knowledge (language and understanding), public health data, the pharmacology of medicinal substances, the physiological effects of medicinal practices, and preclinical and clinical research. Furthermore, medical and patient centered policy and regulations are ones t hat account for the experiences, interests, wants, and wellbeing of patients, their caregivers and healthcare providers, and that of any other stakeholders in service to patients in order to meet patient needs and improve patient outcomes. Clearly define medical use versus medicinal plants : Medical use - The (lawful, legal, and regulated) use of cannabis for medical purposes; the use of cannabis to address or treat medical conditions. Medicinal plants - plants that have therapeutic potential ; can be homeopathic. Traditional Medicine /Alternative Medicine/Traditional Knowledge/Western Medicine/Natural Medicine - history of using language to alter meaning. Launch a broad cannabis public health education campaign which includes a budget item and subject matter experts. Campaign may include three major audiences, patients, healthcare providers, and collateral decision makers. Provide resource materials on cannabis as plant medicine . Resource materials should be developed in coordination with the OCC, OLCC, OHA and ODA with a focus on: Patient Public Health Education Campaign Resources should be no cost; Pamphlet for how a patient can speak with Attending Provider; Promoting patient self -care and independence; Providing a list of participating healthcare providers and clinics knowledgeable in cannabis as medicine; How to become an OMMP patient; and Joint Patient Equity and Governance Frame Working Subcommittee Report/Recommendations to the OCC - Page 4 How to use/self -administer cannabis ; Cannabi s dosing template/ guidelines (intake methods, duration expectations); take into account body, lifestyle, top complaints in addition to just condition, genetic mutations and contraindications to cannabis specific to genetic mutations. Dosage may be specific to each person, n ot condition grouped. General template over sp ecific guidelines. Story, symptoms and condition. Healthcare Providers CME For example, each retail store should have a brochure rack with this information. Additional brochures on CBD/THC what's the difference? What's Delta 8? Etc. Resources for future research ; use of language innovation: https://rollingout.com/2017/11/15/heres -morehouse -school -medicine -genius / https://prometra.org/ Expand package limits for patients, re -establish purchase limits for OMMP cardholders to 24oz/day, adjust cannabinoid product purchase s and reevaluate statutory non - flower possession limits as they relate to patients. Additional recommendations under consideration The Patient Equity and Governance Frame Working joint subcommittee also reviewed the following for future consideration as recommendations: Involve OCC in source selection of next CTS vendor. Revisit increasing the 20lb transfer limits by OMMP GSA grow sites. Removing grow site segregation of plants within the Cannabis Tracking System (CTS) to allow direct transfers from grow site inventory; and Upgrade CTS to work for GSA growers and patients. o Eliminate tracking of pati ent and caregiver purchases. o Cybersecurity and vetting of vendors and CTS employees. o Harvest amalgamation . o Eliminate tagging plants . o Correct ongoing reporting for a lapsed card. o Personal agreement recognized by CTS . Align requirement for showing government ID beyond a certain age with alcohol purchase rules such as in grocery stores. In Closing In closing, attempting to reshape retail stores to reflect the once popular OHA medical only dispensaries and the many services provided for patients may not be possible for a variety of Joint Patient Equity and Governance Frame Working Subcommittee Report/Recommendations to the OCC - Page 5 reasons not the least of which is license restrictions . This does not mean a patient should be left to their own devices in exploring their options. Testing, labeling and packaging rules ensure public safety but costs for anyone actively using cannabis products of higher strength, larger doses, and larger amounts needed for self-care often push these patients into less safe options where the ir health or safety could be compromised. If we are to truly serve the low- income cannabis patient population, we must ask everyone to participate and we look to these recommendations as the first steps in ensuring our goals of ensuring long -term, affordable access to cannabis and cannabis products are met. _______________ Addendum to Recommendation 5 Quality: All commercial cannabinoid products in Oregon should adhere to current good m anufacturing practices (cGMP). This ensures that all cannabinoid products sold at licensed dispensaries are appropriate for the most vulnerable denominator of consumers (i.e., disabled or health -compromised consumers, and OMMP registered patients). cGMP en tails quality systems that control proper design and monitoring of manufacturing processes and facilities. Beyond quality, adherence to cGMP regulations increases consumer and regulatory confidence in the accuracy and reliability of identity, strength, and purity of cannabinoid products. Quality guidelines should include 1) allowable and non - allowable adulterants or additives that may be introduced during manufacturing to create proprietary finished products, 2) maximum parts -per-million (ppm) guidelines fo r allowable adulterants or additives and 3) criteria for meeting \"medical grade\" certification. Availability: Licensed dispensaries should offer a range of cannabinoid product forms to meet the needs of their diverse patrons. Such products include dried flower and leaves, dried roots, concentrates and extracts, pre- rolls, vape pens and inhalers, tinctures, capsules and edibles (including potable liquids), topicals and transdermals, suppositories, cosmetics, and other personal care goods containing cannabi noids of a wide variety of strengths. Cannabinoid Strength: Cannabinoid products should be categorically differentiated by strength to help licensed dispensary personnel and consumers more easily navigate potency. Dispensary personnel should be trained to understand the difference between low -strength, high -strength, and medical - strength cannabinoid products: - Low strength: - Generally refers to intermediate or finished cannabinoid products derived from hemp or marijuana, or comprised of semi- synthesized or synthesized (e.g., delta -8 and delta -10 THC) cannabinoids with - A total THC (i.e., combined THCA + delta -8 + -9 + - 10 THC) concentration of not more than 0.3 percent by volume or weight, and - A total concentration of any other individual phytocannabinoid (CBX) of not more than 25 (or up to 50) percent by volume or weight Joint Patient Equity and Governance Frame Working Subcommittee Report/Recommendations to the OCC - Page 6 - CBX is for non- THC cannabinoids, THCV which is non- intoxicating) - The idea here is that the closer a product comes to an isolate, the higher we regard its strength and need for tighter oversight - High strength: - Generally refers to intermediate or finished cannabinoid products derived from hemp or marijuana, or comprised of semi- synthesized or synthesized cannabinoids with - A total THC concentration of more than 0.3 percent up to 70 percent by volume or weight, or - A total concentration of any other individual phytocannabinoid of more than 25 (or up to 50) percent up to 70 percent by volume or weight - Medical strength: - Generally refers to finished cannabinoid products derived from hemp or marijuana, or comprised of semi- synthesized or synthesized cannabinoids with - A total THC concentration of more than 70 percent by volume or weight, or - A total concentration of any other individ ual phytocannabinoid of more than 70 percent by volume or weight - Medical strength is a potency designation accessible only to OMMP registered patients. - \"Medical strength\" indicates that products meet the qualitative requirements of medical grade*, but are of a highest -strength that requires verifiable medical oversight (i.e., having a valid OMMP registry ID). - Refer to this Cannabinoid Potency Chart for specific recommendations Labeling: All cannabinoid products should be labeled and adhere to a standardized format (see DFCR's Universal Label ). - More important than strain name or indica/sativa/hybrid desi gnations, labels should indicate: - Product form (e.g, Tincture ) - Strength (e.g., low -, high- , or medical -strength ) - ratio** (aka cannabinoid ratio) - Number of servings per package (e.g., 5, 10, 20, or 30 ) - Mg of each cannabinoid per serving (e.g., 5mg THC/serving) - Total mg of each quantifiable Lot/batch # - Expiration date - QR code to - COA - Expanded safety information and warnings for high - and medical -strength products, edibles, and potable liquids (e.g., activation time and duration of Joint Patient Equity and Governance Frame Working Subcommittee Report/Recommendations to the OCC - Page 7 effect, risk of potentiation with fatty foods, and possible adverse effects including psychedelic effects and psychosis - Disclosures about origin, specifically whether cannabinoids and/or terpenes are cannabis -derived, natural, semi- synthetic, or synthetic. *Additional designations: - Medical grade: refers to low -, high -, and medical -strength cannabinoid produc ts that are made with all natural, organic, and no artificial ingredients (e.g., chemical dyes or synthetic flavorings or sweeteners). Cannabinoid products can be certified as \"medical grade\" if they meet minimal criteria. - This is a significant change from the current definition listed on the OLCC website wherein, \" Medical grade means marijuana items that have a higher THC concentration limit compared to items sold to recreational customers. For example a recreational customer can buy a package of edibles t hat contains up to 50 mg of THC and each serving size in that package can be up to 5mg of THC. A medical grade edible sold to an OMMP registered patient can contain up to 100 mg of THC per package and there is no maximum serving size for medical grade edibles. \" 1) This is actually a description of strength. 2) All strengths can be used for medical purposes. - Medical quantity: refers to purchase limit allowances for OMMP registered patients in all strength categories. - +Chlorophyll: refers to cannabinoid prod ucts with retained chlorophyll **All cannabinoid product labels must include a CBD -to-THC ratio written CBD:THC with CBD always written first and regardless of the predominant cannabinoid when THC is detectable, e.g., THC, CBD:THC 1:4. Other cannabinoids can be included in the ratio when detectable, and should also be written with CBD first, e.g., CBDA:CBD:THCA:THC 1:1:1:1, or CBD:THC:CBG 10:1:1 . This ratio should never be written THC:CBD with THC first. "}
