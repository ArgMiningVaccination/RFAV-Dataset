Many Complimentary and Alternative Medicine practices embody this concept \u2014 in different ways. New field of study Psychoneuroimmunology PNI studies the relationship between the mind, thoughts, feelings on our nervous system and in turn our immune systemPsychoneuroimmunology Psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) is the study of the interaction between the psychological processes, the nervous and immune systems of the human body.[1] PNI takes an interdisciplinary diseases , endocrinology , and rheumatology .Why do we need mind body medicine Allopathic medicine is not working We are in the midst of chronic disease epidemic despite the quality of medicine that is practiced in the USA its been unable to stop the dangerously fast growth of auto immune diseases Something else needs to be done to prevent disease 50 years ago a policy decision was made to take the language psychosomatic out of medical books Dr. Sarno says this is a big mistake Today there are hundreds of universities in the USA offering degrees in psychosomatic medicine Yet our medical system still follows its protocols as if emotions have little to do with healthMind Body Medicine: We are a population that is out of balance Many Scholars/Researchers are saying we are in the throws of chronic, autoimmune and chronic pain epidemic, that is getting worse quickly Depression is the most common diagnosis, and piggy backs most autoimmune diseases Our reactions to stress are making us sick We are what we eat...we need to detox our food Processed foods, sugar, alcohol, T we are what we think, we need to detox the mind Computers, television, present challenges Medications and drugs offer no cure Overwork, conflict between work relationships and familyMind -body techniques Mind -body techniques can be helpful for many conditions because they encourage relaxation, active the parasympathetic nervous system, improve coping skills, reduce tension and pain, and lessen the need for medication. They may or may not cure the disease, however life is greatly improved by daily mind -body practicesThere is a direct relationship between.. Our emotions and our body Our body has a language of its own, feelings. Our breath mirrors our emotions Even though we may not have time for grief or not be able to express our anger our body still does Mind body medicine is about reflecting on what we have done with those emotions, how did we push them away, were they hidden behind addictions to cover and distract from the pain? Once conscious of how ignored emotions have negative physical side affects, we can take some time to properly process our habits the results and how to make choices that support health The body feels it all, emotions may not directly cause a disease but by weaking our energy then compounded, by other stressors that we cannot control, result is further stress and diseaseWhy Practice Body Mind Medicine Mind body medicine is complementary to the care you get from your doctor, notinstead of, and increases your ability to be healthy It improves the effectiveness of the work your doctor does for you Often less medication is needed, when holistic practices are used It focuses on wellness of the hole person, mind body and spirit while your doctor focuses on the pathology or disease. You may not be cured but you will feel better, and be happier You take responsibility for your health and feelings, not give this responsibility away Your doctor does not consider healing our emotional wounds and faulty belief systems and sometimes healing this is the missing step one needs to heal and feel betterTips using body mind medicine When the disease prevents or slows our movement, we need as many doable affordable helpful therapies, as daily practices which will Energize the body Maintain blood flow Nutrition delivered to the cell Wastes taken away from the cells and the body If we do not have daily frequency of replacements to motion, we will loose health and strength dailyTypes of Complimentary Mind -Body Medicine Acupuncture Accupressure Body work Reflexology Yoga, Ti Chi, Ai Chi, Nia Medical chi gong Specific types of breathing Buteyko method, Fire Breathing Meditation to connect with body and subconscious Reiki, therapeutic touch Prayer Homeopathy Naturopathy Bio-feedback DowsingHypnosis, hypnotherapy Flexibility and stretching daily Ayurveda, Indian system of medicine Indian Head Massage Body Harmonics` Vibration, Shaking Herbal remedies Detoxification Walking meditation Sound meditationMind and spirit medicine Unconditional love Support groups, healing groups Forgiveness Music as medicine Positive psychology Conscious choice Body awareness Moment to moment awareness and presence Fun, pleasureLots of Hugs Healing Relationships Self care and kindness Laughter Aroma therapy Psychosomatic therapy Analysis of dreams reflection and Journaling Self interest/care/love and planning for self Acceptance and letting go Mudding, gardening Personal growth New Research Proves the Connection Bruce Lipton Ph.D. \"Our Beliefs Control our Biology\" Candice Pert Ph.D. \"The body is the Sub -Conscious Mind\" Dr. Daniel J Siegel \"The Neurobiology of Well - Being\" Dr. Fred Luskin Ph.D. \"Forgiveness: Prescription for Health and Happiness John E.

She said Well Aren't you going to get angry?

Chemicals, neuropeptides go with it, even if emotions are repressed and ignored Negative emotions are not necessarily damaging if they are processed and let go held in anger and resentment is exceedingly toxic and painful for the body Also harmful is rumination and cyclic thinking We must be willing to take a look at some of the hard places, accept, forgive, let go, and choose peace, ease and better health and feelings in the future Because we can't see these emotions, we might think they no long exist, until a problem with our health is the resultThe Body Completely Rebuilds Itself Every seven years or so the body completely rebuilds itself millions of cells regenerate every minute Why does the body continue to rebuild the body in the diseased or broken state Its because the beliefs and causes of the disease have not changed In some cases patients shift their beliefs and cure their illness and injuries, Molly, Depak story, Kennedy studyInspiration Molly -HaleDisease is not your fault, but once educated wellness is your choice to make When we do not know that our beliefs and behaviors affect our biology and weaken our physiology we can not be responsible for the results Once we know however, we can choose to be empowered to examine our old beliefs, past on to us from others forgive ourselves and others We can Choose to educate ourselves on how to create a healing environment to thrive within We can choose relaxation, ease, and peace the immune system thrives in this environmentGet reconnected to the body Our society is all about the wisdom of the brain not the wisdom of the body We have been discouraged from knowing the body Our medical system encourages us to depend on their advice not our own internal wisdom From when we were children as soon as we were sick we had to go to the doctor, its what we have been taught to do Insurance companies can be part of the problemThe damage done by the inner critic The inner critic that shames and blames and criticizes without end hurts our body, your choices and your future The Pain body principle, by Eckart Tolle Be your own best friend, When you hear the inner voice assault you, choose new language When the inner voice says, you always screw up Reframe the language as if a loving gentle forgiving mother or an inspired life coach were the voice in your mind, or your best friend Your Body Speaks Your Mind The symptoms of the disease are the words and the language of the body Review the years before the illness ...what was going on, was there chronic stress, hard times, a broken heart, loss of a loved one, chronic dissatisfaction? Dr Ruth Oratz says the a medical condition is not one disease, she inquires about the dis -ease in relationships, work, family, finances, history, to put together a healing program to all causes of the diseaseInteresting Fact In studies of people with multiple personalities it was found that each personality had separate health issues One personality needed glasses, and had high blood pressure and cholesterol Another personality in the same individual had 20/20 vision and good health One had diseases the other didn't, which supports the fact that many ailments are affected by emotions and behavior, environment, perceptionsHow to Choose a Therapy Research the benefits, Choose therapies that provide you with education that improves your ability to create wellness on your own from what you learn from the practitioner Choose exercise programs that teach the mind body connection Expectations: Nothing except perhaps god will cure you in an instant, expect to work at healing every day, so choose therapies that help you to cultivate a personal and daily health practice Choose practitioners who teach you independence Choose group therapy, exercise, meditation, self healing classes, support groups, they are affordable and offer learning that you can take home with youThe Chakra System is an Assessment Tool in Mind Body Medicine The chakras are recognized in both Chinese and Indian Medicine Use the information that follows to find qualities that you have that may provide insight into your own unique story Be willing to learn and let go of the old beliefs that no long serve you Use the list of balanced qualities as a guide to incorporate and grow towardThe Chakra System -Proven by Science Dr. Pert PH.D author of Your body is your subconscious mind, and Molecules of Emotion: The science behind Mind -Body Medicine, says that science is proving the existence of the Chakra's system as believed for thousands of years by the Buddhist, Taoist, Chinese, Tibet, India, Aztec etc Physiologically each chakra is a mini brain: with a concentration of electrical and chemical activity that receive, process, and distribute information from the rest of the body and mind. If one chakra is neglected or traumatized it affects the rest, and restoring energy flow to a blocked chakra improves the whole chakra system.The Seven ChakrasThe Chakras are Central Control Units The chakras are part of a larger system, including all the energy meridians and acupressure points. The chakras are similar to a central control unit that run smaller, information pathways There are 7 major chakras, each corresponding with a major endocrine gland Each Chakra has specific functions combining the physical, emotional, intellectual and energetic aspects of human lifeThe 7 Chakras Chakras are energy centers with a living pulse. Energy is not static, energy is in constant flux. Chakras not only open and close, they will also expand and retract. When a stressed chakra is shutting down, a healthier chakra will often expand to compensate for the lowering of the whole energy system. When the chakras are not functioning together optimally as a healthy team illness and disease manifests.Root Chakra Symbol Mandala Facilitates : Grounding, material security, balance of physical body, clearing of fear. 1stor Root Chakra: Earth element The root chakra is all about survival, meeting the basic human needs of shelter, food and self preservation The root chakra is located near in the centre of the perineum, near the anus/colon The Root Chakra is the site of intense neuropeptide* activity (information transmitters*) The anal sphincter possesses a more highly developed intelligence then do the brains of the lower order of mammals The colon is affected and involved in emotional issues such as fear for survival, worry over financial issues, or sexual dysfunction this is why conditions such as spastic colon, constipation, diarrhea, arise during specific stressful, emotional events The first chakra is support for the chakra above itExcessive Characteristics May possess one or more Heaviness, sluggishness, slow Resistance to change Overeating and obesity Hoarding Material fixation, greediness Workaholic Excessive spendingDeficient Characteristics May possess one or more Fear, Anxiety Resistance to Structure Underweight, or eating disorder Spaced out, Flightiness, vagueness, too much thinking Disconnected from body Restless can't sit Difficulty meeting life's goalsWhen In Balance Grounded -ness Physical health, being comfortable in your body have a sense of safety and security right livelihood, prosperity ability to be still presence in the here and nowDiseases of the Root Chakra Addictions and addictive behaviors Anorexia Obesity Diarrhea Impotence Kidney Stones PilesCrohn's disease Colitis Hypertension High Blood PressureHow to Heal the First Chakra Reconnect with nature by gardening, hiking, biking, swimming, walk barefoot Feng Shui your environment as living in chaos helps to deregulate us and our health Create a pleasant place to restore your energy, and meditate Work out any problems with Diet Deepen and complete breathing to bring energy to the root Pelvic floor contraction Ex.Bring more laughter to your life Avoid over sleeping, eating working, too much doing Practice body awareness exercise like yoga, medical chi gong Strengthen the legs Improve flexibility of the low back and hips Get help to work through survival issues or old beliefs around survival issues Use taping to energize the areaSacral Chakra Mandala Facilitates: Sexual creativity, primal understanding, relief of tension, augments relationships The 2ndor Pelvic Chakra: Water Element Refers to the entire sacral area of the body: hips, low back, abdomen, and genitals.

If you draw the clients attention to their thinking they will quickly disagree with you They are too close to it to see it Their ego needs to be right, and will block the truthPay AttentionIf we pay attention we start to see more clearly. Meditation is a valuable tool It is used to cultivate the ability to see ones self more clearly, to see/hear the mind chatter that is driving some of the physiological responses Meditation as a tool In meditation one purpose is to watch the mind in its chaotic thinking and get to know it. Once aware if how the mind has power over our physiological responses one can start the process of awareness toward change work towards a calmer clearer mind that is better able to handle stressors Cultivate the ability to stay present to the pain and work with it, not run from itHow to Stop Thinking Negative Develop a breath/meditation practice if you are aware of your breath you can develop awareness of the body and the brain. Awareness leads to recognition of underlying causes and negative thinking Awareness allows you stop the thoughts in their tracks (If you choose) The ability to be conscious is a skill which requires practice, diligence and courage. Challenge every negative thought with a more positive, wellness orientated, feel better thought.Awareness InventoryDo an inventory of thoughts as you are able to be aware of them and record them on paper Discover the complete language of the inner voice (almost always negative) Now make a list of positive replacement thoughts for each item on the list Develop a new language and vocabulary for the inner voice Now get to know the positive list and use it to replace negative thinking whenever it happens. Review your positive list daily Turning a Negative into a Positive I can cope with this pain, I have before, I am gaining knowledge and experience, of how I have an influence on the pain. I know I need to breath deep and slow, exhale the tension, and try to relax the body and mind I know this pain is not permanent, If I pay attention to it, I can see that it increases and decreases. Like waves. More Re -balancing language I believe if I pay attention to the pain, and not react to it, I can practice letting and breathe and calm my mind and I know I have the power feel better. I am learning coping skills every day. I am learning to work with the pain and learn about it, I feel I can influence it. I am a good person, I am not a failure, I know I can improve if I stay focused on wellnessUnstoppable Negative Thoughts If your negative thoughts are unstoppable then bring out an inner voice that is the Head Nazi, that will challenge the negative thinking with a loud voice Stop the negativity! Shut Up I won't have this negative thinking going on Stop hurting yourself with this thinking Stop being a victim, only the thinking makes it so Stop it, you have tools choices and options use them.\"A\" stands for the activating event E.g. the muscle spasm that stopped you from going to the family picnic \"B\" Stands for the belief system, or negative thoughts that get activated E.g. I feel like I have let my family down, let me down \"C\" Stands for emotional consequences of those negative thoughts E.g. you feel guilty, frustrated and depressed \"D\" Stands for Dispute the thoughts that you choose to think E.g. \"it doesn't make me a bad person just because my pain keeps me from participating Activation Belief Consequences DisputeChoices Take an honest assessment of the choices you make because of your pain. Take some time to ask if you have used your pain in some way as an excuse to avoid something you didn't want to do \"not tonight dear I have a head ache\" Look for ways where you may be rewarded for staying focused on your pain. Talk this issue over with a friend, or family member, or a councilor. Most importantly rememberBe aware how you are creating your experience in every moment Recognize what and how you create moment by moment Dispute thoughts that are irrational or are not true and replace them with healthier, more realistic statements. Be responsible for your thinking... blaming the pain on your 5 minutes physical activity leads to fear of exercise and atrophy. It was actually your anxiety about doing the exercise that created the problem. You may have learned to communicate pain with your body and not your voice. Grimacing, frowning, limping Crying Complaining about it Getting quiet Withdraw from others Getting irritableHolding feelings inside can lead to: Depressed feeling and emotion Physical problems Somatization, more pain Building up and lashing out Stress problemsCommunication and PainThe Pain Story When to Tell it Each time the story of the suffering is retold it entrenches the story more deeply into a pattern...memories....the past has a hold of your energy and it is running your future It is better to focus on what is needed in the moment and adopt a positive mind state that focuses on your path to feeling better Reviewing the struggles can make the struggle fresh, somatic memory activation the feeling of depression and grief can be revisited over and over again, activating memories which activate the physiology Inflicting more stress to your condition. Focusing on Solutions To become well we need to focus on the solution more than the problem.

Learn to create health harmony and happiness in your life. Pain and Stress Without question, the stress response has a negative effect on most people living with chronic pain. Stressor Brain Activated Neuroendocrine system Cascade of Stress Responses Neuroendocrine system A group of stress hormones, known as glucocorticoids are released into the blood stream Includes cortisol, adrenocorticotopic hormones growth hormones beta endorphins They cause changes in digestion (increased acid release), breathing becomes shallow and the body perspires to cool down. Catecholamine system:Adrenaline and noradrenaline make the sensory circuits in the brain more sensitive, keeping all of your senses on guard. They also affect the cardiovascular system by causing the heart rate to increase, blood pressure and muscle tone to increase and the capillaries to dilate. the body redirects its energy resources to the emergency response system the body's repair function of the immune system is on hold. SNS becomes a danger to health if the system is being activated for emotional and mental stressors. Unfortunately in humans the stress response can be by imaginary threats or even persistent worry. Habitual mulling over of stressful events have terrible consequences on all of us who do this. Future events suffer the consequences of this thinking and past events get pulled into present awareness and add to the layers of stressful thinking and stressful responses. In this stressed, worried or fearful state, the body is forced to remain in a hyper -alert state, releasing stress hormones into the blood stream relatively constantly. Although our kidneys go a long way in filtering out the stress hormones so that the body can return to a more normal state, they cannot keep up with their constant release. It is like trying to bail out a leaking boat with a thimble. Long Term Effects of Chronic Stress When the blood stream is bathed in stress hormones as a constant state, the body becomes toxic. Over time the toxicity of stress causes disruption in sleep patterns, digestion, general health, ability to think, remember, and limits our ability to enjoy life. Chronic intense stress leads to a breakdown in our body's ability to find balance. Too much cortisol over time has a negative effect on the hippocampus part of the brain, which in turn dis - regulates immune function. As the immune system breaks down, you become susceptible to germs and viruses that make you ill. Continual Release of Adrenaline and Noradrenaline puts pressure on the cardiovascular system and puts people at risk for heart disease. In order to process undigested food for the energy during a crisis the gastrointestinal system releases extra acid in the stomach and intestines. Continual release of acid begins to break down the lining of the GI tract, making it more vulnerable to perforations and ulcers. Chronic Stress and Thinking: Excess Cortisol negatively impacts the hippocampus. The hippocampus is responsible for memory, concentration, decision -making and mental blocks. Chronic stress has a negative impact on Memory Causes mental blocks Impairs decision making Impairs memoryDoes Stress Affects Emotions? When you feel anxious, nervous or tense, your mind is attempting to give you an emotional signal that you need to pay attention to your body. A build -up of anxiety can result in feeling depressed, being frustrated and irritable, and even just losing interest in day -to-day activities. Stress and Behavior: Often those in chronic pain and stress have maladaptive stress management behaviors: use street drugs or alcohol over use prescribed medications increase smoking stop eating or eat to much hang out the with the wrong crowd, to gain a sense of belonging or power over their lives.

When the pain rises to a peak it is called a \"flare up\" Most people learn fairly quickly which physical activities will provoke a flare up. Sometimes there is a flare up without a anything physical to provoke it. Not knowing how to prevent these kinds of flare -ups set up fear based caution We are not just a body the mind connection contributes to flares Many have patterns of flare -ups are caused by mental, emotional, nutritional or mood, stressorsPrevention of Flares Prevent flares where possible apply all your tools to reduce the intensity and duration of a flare -up Pacing Saying No Setting Limits with Others Exercising and keeping yourself fit Maintaining good nutrition Socializing Managing Stress Attending to your posture and ergonomic setupYour Reaction to a Flare Up Your reaction to a flare up of pain makes a huge difference in what happens next. The body/mind has been conditioned to interpret the pain signal as a threat or emergency. when we feel pain, we look as if we were being attacked, tensing our muscles, holding our breath, clenching our teeth and feeling panicky. Pain is information, the bodies way to communicating to the brain. Because we perceive pain as a threat we try to get rid of it or ignore it. It is precisely this action that makes the come back again and again hoping that conscious mind is paying attention Always move towards pain with all your attention, curiosity, willingness to do what it takes to understand the message in the painReversing the Stress Response Is hard, especially when you are feeling a sharp or intense pain learning to master our reaction to a flare up can reduce the impact of the flare up and give you a greater sense of control in your life. When a flare begins engage as many tools as you need to create wellness and release pain, as you need, avoid giving up. Managing Flares Reaction to a flare up has many levels Physical (tensing, clenching, shallow breathing) Emotional (panic, fear, anger, frustration) Cognitive or thoughts (panicky or blaming thoughts) Spiritual (why me?)Mastering your pain plan having a multi -layered plan that includes many different ways of coping will be more effective in getting you through the pain For each category, list as many possible coping strategies as you can in addition to the ones already listed. Physical Tools: Breathing techniques Relaxation Exercise Heat, Ice Massage Acupressure TENS Stretching exercise Medications Get into a pain free positionsEmotional/ Behavioral Tools: Talk out your feelings Let go of the small things that bother you Manage stress Be assertive with communication Sing Laughter YogaSocial: Set limits Ask for support Journal Be assertive and set limits Ask for company or support Have a supportive person act as a coach Do something fun or distracting Don't be attached to a specific outcome, like the way things used to be, open to accepting things how they are nowCognitive: (change the way you are thinking) Talk yourself through it Avoid catastrophizing or intensifying the difficulties, avoid telling everyone Take a nurturing and loving tone with yourself Visualize yourself getting through it Use distraction, a nice walk in nature Use positive coping statements Don't get angry it makes thinks much worseSpiritual: Meditate Pray (ask for help in the moment) Step back and take a big picture view Ask for strength courage, support and wisdom Practice Gratitude daily to reduce focusing on what's wrong and cultivate positive energyEnvironmental: Get into a comfortable position Make your surroundings more comfortable (use pillows, turn of the TV etc.) Listen to a relaxation tape or healing music, guided meditation.
