Anthroposophic medicinal products are administered in various ways: as internal medications (triturations, drops and drop mixtures, pillules, suppositories), injectables, topical medications (eye and ear drops, vaginal tablets and gels, etc.) and external agents (gels, ointments, oils). A second, equally valuable pillar of treatment concerns external applications, compresses and poultices. With these treatments, the therapeutic effect results from the material effects of the substances used as well as from the functionality of warmth, moisture, rest and movement. It is divided into 2 parts: The Vademecum of Anthroposophic Medicines is available in its 4th German edition in both printed and electronic form. It is also available in English, French, Spanish and Italian. The open access Vademecum of External Applications in Anthroposophic Nursing is available online in three languages: German, English and Spanish. It is continuously updated. In both sections, reports of repeated positive experiences with medications or applications are sent to the respective editorial office, where they are subjected to a screening procedure. Both parts of the Vademecum are \"works in progress\". Users are expressly invited to provide both corroborative and critical feedback. Both corroborative and critical feedback are published. "}
