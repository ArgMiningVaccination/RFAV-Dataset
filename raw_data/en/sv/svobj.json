Group Healing Session \"I had the pleasure of experiencing a session with Julie when she came to speak at a national conference for doctors and clinicians in emergency medicine. Her presentation was enlightening and well received by the audience. Julie then followed her talk with a group healing which was very popular. \"The simple act of quiet meditation and taking time to be in the moment proved very rewarding for me personally, and the impact it had on others within the group was equally noticeable. I would highly recommend Julie and her approach to the healing experience and understanding of oneself.\" \u2014 Jen, North Wales \"And after years of being on the 'spiritual circuit', I can honestly say, I have never felt safer in a workshop environment.\" \"Julie's facilitating is so clearly informative, sensitive, and intuitive. Her encouragement to guide us safely into our vulnerability and heart healing, is led by her own ability and willingness to be authentic and vulnerable. A truly amazing experience, both times! \"I'm so looking forward to the next one, hopefully later this year.\" \u2014 Gabriella ( the Lake District U.K.) I have been to a couple of Julie's \"Heart Healing\" workshops, down in Hay-on-Wye...... Healing for eating disorder and low self-esteem \"Very often we feel that life doesn't give us a chance to stop and take a breath or it throws into our faces so much that we feel there is no way we can cope. \"Being shy by nature and having low self-esteem, I found difficulty to cope with many life situations that lead to eating disorder and autoimmune conditions. It followed by my husband passing away and my job. I found myself in the situation when we feel it's too much to handle. \"When I met Julie and booked the first session with her I was not looking for a miracle. I was coming with an open mind instead. Familiar about energy medicine, I knew I have nothing to lose but to give it a go after trying various traditional approaches that our medicine offers. \"I felt deep gratitude after the first session straight away. Julie happened to see, feel so much inside of me that only I knew and she was not aware about. Although I didn't feel relief on the emotional level straight away (Julie did mention that it might take few weeks) but, after few weeks the darkness brightened. I felt easier to carry on living. \"Session(s) that followed after the first one gave me the same feeling of gratitude and appreciation. It followed by me reducing the medication and by my eating disorder improving. I've started experiencing the warmth replacing sharp emotional pain in my heart. \"I know there is a long way to recovery and I still have to rely on traditional medicine to a certain extent but I know that without seeing Julie the healing process might not be possible or long and painful. \"Thank you Julie for the miracle.\" \u2014 Lucy, Powys Healing for an injury, depression & anxiety \"I have seen Julie twice at her home clinic now; initially for a chronic shoulder injury, and then for a general anxiety and inability to move forward. \"Whilst I am still going to have to have surgery for the shoulder issue, Julie helped me a great deal by allowing me to make a difficult choice as to how this was going to affect my work/ life choices. \"I have had many different therapies over the years, both physical, and for anxiety and depression. From our first conversation Julie put me at my ease, and she was warm and kind throughout. During the treatments I felt very clear movements of energy and lightening in various areas of my body. Afterwards, I felt much clearer as to where I wanted to be and how I could use my physical inability to work to improve my life balance. \"I have also very much enjoyed taking part in Julie's Distant Heart Healing practices, which seem to have fallen at exactly the times I have needed a boost! \"I would not hesitate to recommend Julie, and if you have not experienced this type of energy work before, I can only say how beneficial I found it; and I plan to visit her again to help me keep on top of a rapidly changing life!\" \u2014 Erica, Hay-on-Wye Healing for trauma \"Having not properly dealt with a trauma from many years ago, my body and my mind has been constantly battling a negative energy resulting in severe depression and anxiety. \"I have tried many different things including, medication, meditation, mindfulness and other alternative therapies. My mum was the one who actually saw a little article that Julie had written about heart healing and suggested that I get in contact with Julie. \"I didn't realise to what extent past events were affecting me until I had my first treatment with Julie. From the first session I felt a weight had been lifted, I was fully able to breathe again and face things head on without breaking down and becoming irrational. \"Julie, you truly have changed my heart and my mind. I have finally been able to accept and move on from things that have been affecting my life on a daily occurrence. Thank you so much Julie, you truly have changed my life.\" \u2014 Sara, Wales Healing for physical & psychological health issues \"I was lucky enough to have several sessions with Julie, and was hoping for some changes in my life. I had read good things about her, but what really surprised me was the speed and depth of her influence. ''After years of ongoing health issues - both physical and psychological - which were extensive and very deep, she quickly got to the bottom of my problems; and worked with me to release unhelpful energy blockages. ''This resulted in a feeling of lightness, and my levels of anxiety and depression became noticeably less. ''I would recommend Julie to anybody who feels blocked, anxious or emotionally stuck. ''She is kind and compassionate; at the same time being very focused on using her skills and abilities in helping people move forward in life. ''The remarkable thing was that this was all done through distance healing. Thank you Julie.\" \u2014 Sharon, London Healing for trauma \"I had no expectations for my first distant healing session with Julie. However I found it so very powerful! ''Within the first five minutes I began to feel a strong heat throughout the whole body, which lasted the full session, accompanied by the deepest state of relaxation I have ever experienced! ''The following day I was quite 'taken aback' by the ease of my authentic honesty, in a difficult situation with my partner - I have struggled with self empowerment for many years - but this time it all felt so easy......there was no difficulty in expressing my truth. I have continued to feel self confident, open hearted and positive....so much so, I am treating myself to a follow up session in a couple of weeks. ''Thank you so much Julie, I can hardly believe the change in me!'' \u2014 Gabriella, Wales Healing for relationships & work ''I have a highly pressurised job, financial difficulties and have just come out of a long term relationship and prior to my healing with Julie was in a pretty sticky spot emotionally. Having had one healing session I am far better able to cope with all the issues and feel a lot lighter. ''None of it is weighing me down anymore and although the problems have not gone away, my negative approach to them has. I feel positive that I will be able to find a way forward through the tough times and have a sense that things will be OK. ''It also feels as if I've also stopped carrying the baggage I have collected over the years that didn't belong to me and this has made me feel a whole lot lighter. My friends have noticed a massive difference in the way I am.\" \u2014 Rachel, London Healing for stress & back pain \"I first met Julie by chance at the home of a mutual friend. At the time, my back was causing me severe pain and she kindly offered to try to help me. She rested her fingers on my shoulders for a few minutes and the result was astounding. The acute pain I was experiencing completely vanished and I felt pain free and amazed! \"Following this experience I made an appointment to see her, not really knowing at the time what she does! Everything was explained fully and we commenced our session in the relaxed, friendly environment of her home. ''At the time my life was very stressful an I was turning into an emotional wreck due to challenging personal circumstances. The outcome of her gentle intervention can only be described as miraculous! As if all the bad stuff, angst, unexpressed grief, and frustration with myself for not coping with my life, had been taken away! I felt totally recharged, able to cope with whatever life throws at me and able again to take time to enjoy the things in life that really matter. Six weeks on and I am still in that happy place! \"I would heartily recommend seeing Julie to anyone who needs help to cope with all the stresses and burdens that life throws at us. I certainly will not hesitate to see her again should the need ever arise!\" "}
