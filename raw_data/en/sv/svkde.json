I am especially honoured to help you with clearing past life, generational and stuck energy. I achieve this through guided messages (Akashic memories) and connecting to expanded higher frequencies. \"I had the most unbelievable healing from Michele. I'm at at a point in my life that I needed the trauma of the past (rape) released as I'm a healer myself. I've been working hard on my healing journey and felt this part just wouldn't shift from my sacral and root chakra. After my healing with Michele I went home and I felt a shift into compassion not fear of having sex . Michele had recoded the deep rooted fear into compassion and it was the best I'd felt in a very long time and most comfortable in 9 long years!! I'd absolutely recommend Michele to anyone with deep rooted trauma to try her Angelic / Dragon healing, it really is out of this world. I'm completely back into my divine feminine energy.\" - Lizzy Every session varies so much and is an exciting journey of exploration. I help you to move forward into more alignment with your Soul purpose. Expand your Soul's GALACTIC connection Allow me to help you shift, clear & expand your energy \"Thank you, Michele. I feel much more grounded now. The light has adjusted and I was able to sleep. Working with Mother Mary, Garbriel and Metatron to clear my system in a field of old outdated energy and allowing the purification process to be easy and to focus on my light and the light crystals in my system so my vibration natural increases and I adjust to my new me.

The GALACTIC energy I work with is just so powerful!\" - Michele A gifted energy healer, soul light code artist and channeler of multi-dimensional galactic energies. \"Michele's session was the catalyst for a life changing movement and shift for me. Her work is authentic and deeply powerful. She is a fantastic Spirit Conduit and Light Worker.\" - Hannah Spirit Conduit and Intuitive Healing Coach What others say \"Lovely session thanks Michele. Felt the peace, energy, unconditional love and harmony; so definitely the right place for me to be. I found it interesting the comments re my role and am now more conscious of this. Thank you again. Keep up the wonderful work you are doing. Lots of love and gratitude \" - Dr. Chris Michele guided me to find the power and strength I had inside me. She helped me tap into a whole new level of power, clarity and knowing, that I can now access anytime and all the time. I feel empowered and free. \"I feel something is definitely integrating and shifting for sure! Definitely still integrating but definitely feeling more solid within myself and less all over the shop. \"Last year I had one of [Michele]'s Soul Code Alignment Activation sessions and I was blown away with what came through for me. It was such a beautiful session and I remember coming to tears. It was exactly what I needed to hear at that time and I am so grateful to have spent this time with Michele she is such a lovely person and I would highly recommend her to anyone\" xx \"It is truely magnificent Michele. The depth, vibrational energy and enlightenment that was felt is truly magnificent. You have certainly moved into a different realm. The world is ready!\" \"I had the pleasure of having an Energy Healing session with Michele recently. Her session was the catalyst for a life changing movement and shift for me. She helped introduce me to my inner child on a level that I had not experienced before. I was able to spend the next month at least, journeying very deep into healing that area of my life. In turn it spun out into other areas as well. Michele is a mover and a shaker. Her work is authentic and deeply powerful. She has a beautiful way of guiding you through the process so that you feel safe and empowered. I would not hesitate in coming to see Michele for another healing again and I intend to do so in the coming months. The first time I met Michele, being a Spirit Conduit and Intuitive Healing Coach myself, I knew she had a gift and something very tangible to utilise for the greater good of all involved. I highly encourage anyone on the journey to healing and understanding the connection between self and spirit to go and see Michele. The talent that she displays in her artwork translates into the energy work she can transmute through you with her connection to the divine. She is a fantastic Spirit Conduit and Light Worker.\" - Hannah Joy Spirit Conduit and Intuitive Healing Coach \"The Soul Code Alignment Activation has given me a sense of direction and a better understanding of my purpose and is such an encouraging, positive and hopeful experience. I would recommend and definitely do another Soul Alignment in the future as well as use any other of Michele's services. She is naturally a happy and light person you would instantly be drawn too. Thank you for the amazing experience Michele. \" \"Your energy has awakened something that has been laying dormant for what I think is a millennia, maybe more. The cobwebs have been cleared away and the codes that you have painted in my aura, my energy field, my soul are working their magic.

Love you for all you give, your energy and inspiration to help others rise. Bless you honey xx\" - Nicole I was so excited to do this beautiful galactic artwork yesterday.

The world is ready.\" \"I attended Michele's Pleiadian Galactic Art workshop and just loved it! We spent the day basking in galactic energies and allowing them to take shape on the canvas, with some meditation, discussion, and delectable veggie lasagna though the day too. I have my painting hung where I see it every day and it's like a portal in the house. I'm thrilled that I made this investment in myself, for something beautiful that came through just for me, which I'll have always. Thanks Michele\" - Courtney "}
