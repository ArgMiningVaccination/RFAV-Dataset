Subscribe to Our Newsletter therapies disarm and defeat cancer? Here we compile experiences and assertions from patients and therapists across the spectrum, which confirm that healing is possible, especially if you opt for alternative therapies exclusively. Retired [Major General Niranjan Singh](https://www.lifepositive.com/Body/Holistic_Cancer_Cure/c_390_Heal_Cancer_Holistically62007.asp) Kullar, an 86-year-old cancer survivor, still works 18 hours daily as advisor to the CEO, Imperial Hotel, New Delhi, after more than three decades of army service. His twinkling eyes, upright gait and trim appearance exude energy and vitality. Who would guess that he is a veteran survivor of not one, but two forms of cancer? Or that he cured cancer through holistic, natural methods exclusively, without chemotherapy or radiation? His healing journey proves that miracles indeed happen to those who create them. In 1971, he had myocarditis, and in 1981, his kidney was removed. In 1984, brain tumour was detected. He had an enlarged prostate gland since 1986. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 1998 at the age of 77, when the Prostatic Specific Antigen (PSA) test showed a level of 54 ng/dl (normal 0.00 - 4 ng/dl). It was the third stage of cancer. His elder brother and sister had died of cancer. Major General Kullar advises, 'Do not operate on the cancerous area. I have seen generals dying because of such operations. If you touch the knife to the cancer, the cells multiply and spread like wild fire.' He used a herbal anti-cancer medicine prescribed by Mangilal Tanwar from Madhya Pradesh. He also followed the nutritional therapy devised by Captain Kailash C Saigal of Interocean Foundation, explained in the book, Down, Down Cancer. 'There is scientific proof that certain components in food can provide significant protection against cancer. Food is your medicine and medicine your food,' he explains. 'Exercise, for cancer patients, is medicine. They should walk in the morning and evening for one hour or half an hour. I once had two telephones at the office. I kept them on the floor one on the right, one on the left. I used to bend and pick them up for exercise,' he adds. He also underlines the importance of positive thinking. 'I am never under any stress or tension,' he says. Major General Kullar's brain tumour remains harmless due to the anti-cancer regimen. He has been free from prostate cancer for the last six years. Now his PSA test reading is zero. Cancer encompasses a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation that can affect all organs. In metastasis, cancer cells multiply and travel through blood and the lymph system to the rest of the body. Cancer in any form remains a dreaded diagnosis, not just because of the looming shadow of death, but also due to the severe side-effects of allopathic treatments like chemotherapy and radiation.

Why Try Holistic Therapies? According to a Los Angeles Times report, 'Over 75 per cent of the oncologists polled said that if they had cancer, they would never use the same chemotherapy they prescribe for their patients, because of the ineffectiveness of chemotherapy, and its unacceptable degree of toxicity.' Chemotherapy and radiation kill cancer cells, but harm the immune system. The temporarily suppressed cancer often reappears, since the body cannot defend itself with weakened immunity. 'How much better it is to nourish the immune system directly by the use of natural therapies to assist it in getting you well, instead of destroying it by the use of these therapies! Then the immune system itself can kill the cancer cells without any side-effects, and heal your body at the same time,' writes Dr Loraine Day, M.D., who cured her breast cancer naturally. Modern oncology (study of tumours) is based on the Halstead theory by W S Halstead. He focussed on treating and removing tumours to cure cancer. But cancer mortality rate remains unchanged despite advanced surgical techniques and aggressive modern treatments. Halstead's theory is inadequate because it ignores the patient as a whole living organism. 'While conventional medicine primarily treats cancer as a focal disease with localized symptoms, naturally oriented physicians view the body as a closed internal ecosystem, and believe that the dysfunction of this ecosystem leads to the development of cancer,' writes Dr Michael Lam, a top US-based physician and author of the book, Beating Cancer With Natural Medicine. Deepak Chopra, the apostle of Ayurveda and mind/body medicine, in his book, Quantum Healing, asks, 'Why, when your body mends a broken arm, is it not considered a miracle, but when your body rids itself of cancer, it is?' Blending advanced physics with ancient Indian Ayurvedic insights, he shows that the human body is governed by a 'network of intelligence' grounded in quantum reality. This intelligence exists in our 50 trillion cells, and a cell can heal itself of even cancer. Strengthening of immunity, healthy lifestyle, diet, exercise and access to the Divine consciousness within, through yogic and meditative disciplines, can correct the wrong information that triggers uncontrollable cell multiplication, and cure cancer from the quantum level of the body.

Ayurveda against Cancer North and South Indian schools of Ayurveda offer time-tested treatments against cancer. As per ayurveda, the human body is governed by the tridoshavata, pitta and kapha. Faridabad, 'Cancer is the result of the body's reaction to what aggravates the tridosha.' Ayurveda suggests sticking to swastha, which includes regular seasonal routines of proper diet and natural lifestyle. When individuals ignore it and indulge in improper food, late nights, overwork, daytime sleep, stimulants, intoxicants, chemical drugs, stress and anxiety, the dosha imbalance starts triggering disease. This weakens the digestive fire (jataragni), causing formation of ama (toxins), which circulates in the body blocking channels (strotas). This causes deformation of channels. 'This vicious cycle of aggravation of doshas and ama formation, coupled with deformation of channels, triggers abnormal cell growth, causing cancer,' says Dr Chauhan. For cancer treatment, Dr Chauhan recommends the following Ayurvedic holistic methods: Abstinence from root cause: The first step is avoiding a harmful diet or lifestyle that aggravates the root cause, tridosha imbalance. Eliminating aggravated doshas: They are eliminated by flushing them out of the body through panchakarma, involving purifying therapies to enhance metabolic Treating jataragni:Jataragni controls digestion and nourishment. It helps the formation of nutritive fluid (ahara rasa), physical elements (doshas), tissues (dhatus) and waste (malas). Treatment maintains healthy jataragni functioning. Rejuvenation:Rasayana medicines maintain enzymes and metabolism in peak condition, and enhance the generation of new cells and tissues. Rasayanas prevent and alleviate conditions associated with cancer, and increase ojas to boost immunity and strengthen cells and body. Satvavajaya chikitsa: Ayurveda considers mind and body as one entity. Cancer weakens the mind. Spiritual counselling and cultivating a positive, balanced mind are integral to Ayurvedic treatment. 'By bringing our internal, physical and psychological systems into balance, we remove the cause of disease, cure its symptoms, and allow the damage to heal itself,' explains Dr Chauhan. Dr Chauhan has effectively treated cancer patients from India and abroad. Namrata (name changed), 30, had breast cancer. She had surgery and chemotherapy. 'I lost weight, hair and appetite, and my skin looked like that of a 65-year-old. I went through it because I had no choice.' She also had sleeping disorder. After a year-and-a-half of treatment, cancer reappeared in 2005. She had another operation. Finally, she heard of Dr Chauhan. He gave Ayurvedic medicines to cure the side-effects of allopathic medicines, strengthen the body, and prevent cancerous cell formation. 'I am following the prescribed diet, and regularly taking the Ayurvedic medicines. My tests are normal now. My appetite is good. I am not losing hair. I am feeling energetic,' she says. Alan Copeland tried Jiva's Ayunique package. 'My prostate, which was oversized, is now that of a healthy adolescent, according to the Western doctors. They don't know why since their treatments only 'hold' the cancer, ' he writes. Jay Golding had non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and was treated by Dr Chauhan. 'My PET/CAT scans came back negative! No cancer!' He exclaims. Ashtavaidya tradition is a unique ancient branch of Kerala Ayurveda. Ashtavaidyas use only purely traditional methods. Ashtavaidyan E T Divakaran Mooss is the chief physician of the Vaidyaraj Oushadha Sala of Ashtavaidyas. He is also the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi's Ayurvedic University, US. through Ayurvedic treatment in the Ashtavaidya tradition. I have treated about 100 leukemia patients successfully,' he says. The Ashtavaidya tradition assures complete cure if the patients start treatment early without any damaging modern therapies. Cancer patients are initially given intensive three months treatment for removing toxins (ama) from the body, to purify and enhance immunity. Revitalised immunity heals cancer. Medicines are chosen according to the patient's dosha constitution and the cancer condition. Patients must follow prescribed diet and Ayurvedic routine. Panchakarma is used only after the body recovers enough strength through detoxification. Finally, rasayana rejuvenation treatment through kutipravesika or vatatapika therapy is administered. Kutipravesika involves stringent rules and prolonged isolation indoors, which many patients avoid. Vatatapika is speedier and mostly used. Rasayanas are given life-long to prevent recurrence of cancer. Vaidya Chandra Prakash Cancer Research Foundation treats cancer through medicines on Ayurvedic rasa shastra (metallic therapy). Vaidya Balendu Prakash, who runs the foundation, first used the treatment on an infant with acute leukemia who had complete cancer remission within 40 days. In 1996, a project by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare studied the effects of his metallic formulations in Acute Pro-myelocytic Leukemia (APML). Ten out of 15 patients enrolled experienced complete remission. Renowned Ayurvedic specialist, Dr Nandlal Tiwari, Jaipur, Rajasthan, invented the cancer drug Carctol, based on his experiments and information gathered from Assamese tribals. Carctol contains eight herbal ingredients, and has a success rate of 30-40 per cent. Arya Vaidya Sala, Kottakkal, Kerala, has a clinical research unit in the charitable hospital where 150 cancer patients take treatment weekly. Most patients there use Ayurveda as complementary to allopathy, though some opt for Ayurveda exclusively.
