Thursdays, October 7, 14, 21, 28, 2021, 8:15 am - 9:15 am School of Eurythmy, North Room, Chestnut Ridge, NY Pre-registration required on our website at eurythmy.org by Monday, October 4! Eurythmy is a health-giving, harmonizing, and life-sustaining art of movement that works through the whole human being. In making visible the invisible and inaudible experiences of speech and music, eurythmy serves as a bridge between spirit and matter. Through harmonious movement, we connect with the abundant life forces available within and around us, allowing for a rhythmic and breathing encounter with ourselves and the world. In this four-week series, we will explore the interplay between the elements of nature and the sounds of language. Eurythmy, poetry, and nature observation will bring us into relationship with the formative forces of the consonants. Please join us! The ESV community protocols will be followed: wearing masks, observing physical distancing, and filling out the ESV COVID health form.
