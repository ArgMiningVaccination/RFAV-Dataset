It was discovered by a well-known homeopath in India, the late Dr. B. Sahani of Patna. It is just like the radio broadcast system or the Wi-Fi system. In this method of treatment, the patient does not have to take any kind of oral pills/medicine, injection or any type of ointment for whatever condition ails them. Instead, they are treated via medicine energy transmission. Basically, it is a method of healing the mind, body, and soul of a person as a whole through means of energy. Homeopathic medicines are in the form of energy, and energy can be transmitted like radio or mobile signals. Your body and hair share the same DNA. Therefore the energy transmitted through your hair can only be received by your body. Anything that has your DNA has the ability to transmit the energy back to you. Since the hair follicle at the base of human hair contains DNA, it is capable of transmitting the energy from hair back to the patient. In this method, a strand of hair is removed \u2014 either cut or uprooted from the scalp \u2014 and is inserted in the vial containing medicine with a little bit sticking out. That strand of hair is then able to transmit the benefits of the medicine back to the patient using energy transmission. I have been a fan of this method for a long time but was initially hesitant to offer this treatment in my practice. I was worried about how my patients might react if I told them up front about the medicine energy transmission method. However, the results were so convincing that I decided to go public with it and make it my only method of treatment. I am a strict follower of classical homeopathy and have successfully treated patients suffering from severe, acute and chronic diseases throughout India and other countries using medicine energy transmission through hair. Medicine energy transmission seems a bit like a miracle. A patient who is not local and lives far away can also be treated by the transmission of medicine energy through the patient's hair. We use your hair as a transmitter to transmit the selected medicine energy back to your body. Since your hair carries the same DNA as your body, it forms the perfect channel for this method of treatment. Medicine energy transmission is a very safe and healthy method of treating the patient. There is no known harmful side effect of this method at this time. Moreover, we physicians are bound by the oath to \"do no harm,\" always mindful to protect our patients from harm and injustice. In case of any medical emergency when doctor is not available, we advise you to go immediately to the nearest hospital and consult with the local doctor to receive basic treatment. Once your treatment is completed, your hair will either be destroyed or it will be given back to you, if you wish. Energy medicine cannot be transmitted via crude materials, and garbage is crude material. Homeopathic medicines are in the form of energy that flows and works with your body's own healing power to keep you healthy both physically and emotionally. In fact, even the allopathic medicine cannot be transmitted because it is a crude material. They cannot transmit the energy from one location to another. [ A ](#) Do I have to give my hair every time? For how many years that same hair can be used for the treatment? No, you don't need to give your hair every time you come for the treatment. It will be collected only once. In general, a single hair can be used for 5 to 10 years. There is no need to worry about getting excessive medicine in energy transmission. This is because homeopathy is an energy medicine; your body will receive the energy at a rate as per your body requirement. Benefits of medicine energy transmission - It's a hassle free process. No oral medicine is given to the patient so you do not need to worry about taking medicine daily nor having oral medication making you feel sick. - Distance is no barrier for the patients. You can be anywhere in the world and this method of medication will work. - Changing medicine is very easy and the new medication effects are reflected right away. - In case of any aggravation, simply removing the hair from vial will work, you don't need to take any antidote. - It is a continuous process. The patient is receiving the medication 24x7 as long as the patient's hair is placed in the remedy solution. - It is the quickest method of treatment and the effects are seen very fast. - Since there is no oral intake of medicine, this method can be used in religious fasting like Vrat and Ramjan without breaking or hurting the religious sentiments of the patient.

He had taken my history and plucked two hairs for treatment. I was very skeptical initially of this mode of treatment but as a last resort, I had crossed my fingers. His confidence was well placed and my condition got better day by day, even my year's long stammering problem has been cured. I am so inspired by his technique that being an engineer by profession I have taken admission in Diploma course for Homeopathy at Dhaka to learn and spread this great healing art. - Syed Jafar I feel like, it is something which no other medicine can give. It is a very personalized experience. It is to extent that you feel the changes inside you & you are the only person who can tell the change is happening. Over a period you will realize these were the symptoms which were there. Because of this treatment symptoms have gone and you are living a better life. Quality of life definitely improves. This is one way I have taken Homoeopathy. I suggested this medicine transmission through hair to many people, few of them were not able to come, some of them said that they would like to try it for sure. It is about believing or not believing. Actually, the way it is done, people think that it is not possible. I'm a kind who had been benefited by it so I'm propellent of it. - Rajeshwari Tiwari After cure of my Mausi for dreaded CSF Rhinorrhea, I have consulted Dr. Ravi for my mother's various health issues including a brain tumor, kidney stone, and gallstone. Once she developed fever and in an emergency we rushed to nearby Shekhar Hospital and then to Sahara Hospital, somehow she developed Hospital Acquired Infection leading to the constant fever which was resistant to antibiotics. Then I called Dr.Ravi as an alternative hope, he changed her hair from his clinic and she recovered very fast. She is now also free from the kidney stone. Her protein leakage has also been cured by Dr.Ravi. She is still under his treatment and doing Tiwari S/O Rajeshwari Tiwari - to the clinic for Urticaria treatment. Earlier used to have eruption very often. I have consumed more than 1500 Citizen tablets for it and many more. But never got any permanent solution.

Devendra Kumar Mishra - Shivangi Suman Gorakhpur In Vitiligo of my daughter, it worked like a magic. It has been cured very soon without any side-effects. I'm happy with the treatment. Mother of Shivangi Suman ( Gorakhpur) - Shikha Srivastav I took treatment for PCOD, migraine & thyroid. Now after treatment. I'm blessed with a kid. Now I don't have Any complaints regarding Thyroid.

Shikha Srivastava - Ritu Raj Ambedkarnagar This Medicine transmission is like a mobile network... wifi. Everything is good in this system. I wandered a lot for chyluria treatment since last 1 year. Doctors in PGI told that it will never be cured. In KGMC doctors said to inject silver - nitrate. But one of the doctors there advised not to do anything like this. He said to me to avoid fats for the whole of my life. Since I'm taking treatment here I have started taking proper diet. Still avoid poori, parathas but often consumes Non- veg and alcohol, even that doesn't increase my complaints. Chile doesn't appear even after dancing or any kind of exertion. All I need is to take rest as feel little lethargic. RituRaj ( Ambedkarnagar) - Rohit Rai Doctor, You are a very good doctor and a nice human being as well because you hear your patients and understand their sufferings. I had very much ups and downs during 6 months of initial treatment. I was fed up of taking treatments earlier at various doctors. But ultimately got relief. I came to know earlier that the oral medicine (placebo) was not working. The thing affecting me is medicine transmission so I was not taking those oral pills for long. One of my relatives also taking treatment from here and getting good relief. Rohit Rai - Vansh Mishra When I have visited this clinic first time, I was expecting some medicine or ointment for my son's stubborn trouble. After showing my kid to Dr. Ravi I have seen information written at his clinic of the method of \"hair transmission\", but as the last hope, I have tried. I have been to many dermatologists from Lucknow to Balrampur but they offered no permanent results. One of dermatologist suggested me for CAUTERISATION and before that expecting to sign a clinical agreement as if any damage to the eye will happen he will not be responsible. I was scared and left him. Fortunately, I met Dr.Ravi and I have \" no words\" to explain my joy of curing my son with such a harmless and gentle way. My wife's acidity problem has also been cured.
