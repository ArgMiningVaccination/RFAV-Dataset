Neal A. Vanselow, M.D., Chair, and David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D., Vice Chair, presided over the hearing. The quality and depth of the testimony of the witnesses and the lively and constructive dialogue between the presenters and members of the Council were evidence of the success of the Public Hearing. For this, we must thank the individuals and organizations who provided their testimony on the concerns currently facing graduate medical education. Overall direction and coordination of the Public Hearing were provided by its Chairperson, Dr. Neal Vanselow, and Mr. Paul M. Schwab, Executive Secretary to the Council and Deputy Director, Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration. Technical support to the Public Hearing, as to the Council generally was coordinated by Dr. F. Lawrence Clare, Program Staff Coordinator to the Council for the Bureau of Health Professions, and Director of the Office of Graduate Medical Education and Data Analysis of the Division of Medicine, Bureau of Health Professions. Staff to the Council was provided largely by the Division of Medicine, Donald L. Weaver, M.D., Director: Ms. Magdalena Miranda was staff liaison to the Foreign Medical Graduates Subcommittee, and Ms. Brenda Selser provided further staff support to that subcommittee. Mr. Jerald M. Katzoff was staff liaison to the Physician Manpower Subcommittee, and Dr. Clare also served as staff liaison to the GME Programs and Financing Subcommittee. Dr. John Drabek of the Office of Data Analysis and Management, Bureau of Health Professions provided additional technical support, primarily in the area of physician manpower. Program and administrative staff support was provided by Ms. Idelle Price Smith, Mr. Ronald L. Craig and Ms. Patsy McLain, of the Office of Graduate Medical Education and Data Analysis, Division of Medicine. Additional logistical coordination was provided under contract by The Circle, Inc. ix Background The Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME) was established by Public Law 99-272, the \"Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985,\" This legislation established Part Hof the Public Health Service Act, and authorized the Council under a new section 799, ''Council on Graduate Medical Education.\" This section authorizes the Council through September 30, 1996. The Secretary signed the charter for the Council on June 6, 1986. The Council is composed of fourteen private members and three Federal government representatives. The private appointees include six representatives of practicing primary care physicians, national and specialty physicians organization, foreign medical graduates, and medical student and house associations. Four were appointed as representatives of schools of medicine and osteopathy, and public and private teaching hospitals. The remaining four were representatives of health insurers, business, and labor. The three Federal government representatives are the Assistant Secretary for Health or his designee, currently the Administrator of Health Resources and Services Administration; the Chief Medical Director of the Veterans Administration; and the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration. Prior to July 1, 1988 and every three years thereafter, The Council is to provide and make recommendations to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services; the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, and Committee on Finance; and the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, and Committee on Ways and Means. These matters extend to such issues as: specialty shortages and excesses; access to health professions opportunities and services, issues concerning Foreign Medical Graduates; financing GME; and medical education programs. The first Council Meeting was held in Washington, D.C. on December 4 and 5, 1986. Neal A. Vanselow, M.D., Vice President for Health Sciences, University of Minnesota, was elected Chairman and David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D., President, Meharry Medical College, was elected Vice Chairman. Further Council meetings were held on March 17-18, June 29-30, and October 5-6, 1987, and February 17-19, 1988. Three subcommittees were established to operationalize the Council's activities for its first report: (1) physician manpower, (2) foreign medical graduates, and (3) graduate medical education programs and financing. These subcommittees met separately on the first day of each of the Council meetings. In addition, each subcommittee held a one-day Special Meeting between August 28 and September 2, 1987. xi To facilitate its work, the subcommittees first developed a list of issues to guide their deliberations toward reaching conclusions and making recommendations to be considered by the plenary Council for its first report. The subcommittees developed programs featuring expert presentations and papers as a means of providing their members with state\u00ad of-the-art information in their respective areas. The plenary meetings featured major speakers and an information base for the Council as a whole. The Public Hearing offered opportunities to the widest possible range of interested individuals and organizations to present their views and recommendations to the Council. Testimony focused on the issues previously reviewed and approved by the Council on June 30, 1987, and on tentative conclusions and recommendations developed by tbe subcommittees and approved in draft by the Council on October 6, 1987. Thus, the Public Hearing was viewed by the Council as an opportunity to obtain a broad span of views concerning issues and policies from a comprehensive variety of interested organizations and individuals. A total of 46 individuals representing 50 organizations participated in the Public Hearing on November 19 and 20, 1987. In addition, the Council received written testimony from 14 individuals and organizations who were not able to be present at the Hearing. Highlights of the testimony covered such areas as the Council's Principles, the health care needs of the underserved, minority representation in medicine, primary care, resident training in ambulatory settings, measuring the Adequacy of Physician Manpower, phySician surplus and consequences, financial support for FMG residents, and resident substitution. xii COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION MEMBERSHIP ROSTER Ms, Dipali V.

COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PUBLIC HEARING NOVEMBER 19-20, 1987 BETHESDA, MARYLAND AMERICAN ACADEMY OF \u00b7PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS 1117 North 19th Street Arlington, Virginia 22209 703/525-4200 SUMMARY OF TESTIMONY COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (COGME) 1. REDUCING THE SIZE OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND/OR THE REMOVAL OF FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES FROM GME PROGRAMS WILL REQUIRE HOSPITALS TO SECURE OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY CARED FOR BY RESIDENTS. 2. THE FMG SUBCOMMITTEE HEARD TESTIMONY FROM TWO WITNESSES REPRESENTING INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY VOLUNTARILY DECREASED THE SIZE OF THEIR RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. BOTH INSTITUTIONS HAVE HIRED PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS AS HOUSE STAFF TO CARE FOR THE PATIENTS PREVIOUSLY CARED FOR BY RESIDENTS. 3. QUALITY OF CARE AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF CARE WERE MAINTAINED AFTER TRANSITION FROM RESIDENTS TO PA HOUSE STAFF. PRINCIPAL CONCERN OF WITNESSES WAS AVAILABILITY OF PAs AND MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT POLICIES REGARDING PA SERVICES. 4. DESPITE THE \"PHYSICIAN GLUT\" AN UNPRECEDENTED DEMAND FOR PAs EXISTS. OPPORTUNITIES FOR PAs EXIST IN VIRTUALLY EVERY MEDICAL SPECIALTY WITH PARTICULARLY HIGH DEMAND FOR PAs WITH SURGICAL AND PRIMARY CARE EXPERIENCE. 5. ON JANUARY 1, 1987 MEDICARE LAW WAS CHANGED TO PROVIDE FOR COVERAGE OF PA SERVICES PROVIDED IN A HOSPITAL. PAYMENT IS ON A DISCOUNTED FEE BASIS WITH PAYMENT TO THE EMPLOYER OF THE PA. 6. THE ACADEMY STRONGLY SUPPORTS RECOMMENDATION 1.A OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE ON FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES THAT REDUCTIONS IN THE FINANCING OF GME PROGRAMS NOT BE UNDERTAKEN UNTIL ADEQUATE ALTERNATIVES FOR DELIVERING HEALTH CARE TO THE MEDICALLY INDIGENT ARE IN PLACE. 7. THE ACADEMY STRONGLY SUPPORTS RECOMMENDATION l(A)(d) THAT PROVISIONS SHOULD BE MADE FOR EXPANDING EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR ALTERNATIVE HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. 8. THE ACADEMY URGES ADOPTION OF AN ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATION THAT THE H.E.A.L. PROGRAM BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT STUDENTS AS ELIGIBLE APPLICANTS. 1 ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGES OF PODIATRIC MEDICINE TESTIMONY BEFORE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION NOVEMBER 19, 1987 I am Gary Lepow, the Assistant Director at the Harris County Podiatric Residency Program in Houston, Texas and a practicing podiatric physician. I am pleased to have the opportunity to testify before COGME on behalf of the podiatric medical education community. The preponderance of today's 10,000 podiatrists provide general podiatric medicine which entails preventive and primary podiatric medical care. They also provide rehabilitative care of foot conditions and functions, and perform surgical procedures. Historically, the practices of podiatrists have been community\u00ad based in ambulatory settings, with podiatrists self-employed in solo office practices. More recently, however, podiatrists now participate in group practices, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and individual practice associations. The seven colleges of podiatric medical education prepare students in a four-year program for one to three years graduate training in general podiatric medicine, podopediatrics, podogeriatrics, orthopedics/biomechanics, podiatric sports medicine and podiatric surgery, for certification by the pediatric medical specialty boards. As of academic year 1986-87, 454 residents were training in podiatric graduate programs located in 171 institutions in 34 states. This number of institutions includes 31 Veterans Administration Hospitals. The decreases in pediatric residency positions available, and the decreases in the number of residency programs, 1986-87, due principally to the lack of funding for graduate training and the increase in hospital closures, have served as major barriers in the podiatric medical education process. Further, the number of new podiatrists entering the profession, 1986-2020,is projected to decrease from 605 to 575 annually. This decrease will be due primarily to the projected decrease in the 18-24 year olds, and in the college population. 3 Association of Colleges of Pediatric Medicine Testimony before Council on Graduate Medical Education November 19, 1987 The hazards of projecting the health care needs, however, could have a deleterious effect upon the future of this Nation, for in the flurry of the Nation's health policy decisions for the 21st decade, the outcomes of statistical manipulation or econometric model, and the underlying assumptions could be taken as actual fact. Without the benefit of crystal ball, the pediatric medical education community assumes that, for the near future, the U.S. primary health care model will prevail, and thus, will require professionally trained primary care providers. Therefore, the pediatric medical education community proposes o CONTINUED EMPHASIS UPON PRIMARY HEALTH CARE To be ensure support responsive to the Nation's health care needs, an adequate number of primary care providers of primary care education and training. it must through o CONTINUED USE OF CURRENT SCHEME OF FINANCING TIED TO SERVICE Any manipulation in the scheme of financing graduate education, without special care, would contribute further to the erosion of the financial base for health professions graduate education. o CONTNUED PHS PROGRAMS IN SUPPORT OF PRIMARY CARE EDUCATION AND TRAINING Despite the growing perception of the greater relevance of primary rather than tertiary care in today's health care system, without the establishment of a sound financial base for education and training in primary care, the support system should continue as a grant and contract program. 4 NUMBER OF RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS and FIRST YEAR POSITIONS and NUMBER OF COLLEGE OF PODIATRIC 1987 1986 1985 1984 1983 1982 1981 1980 1979 1978 --CPME Approved Residency Programs -167 155 153 136 139 128 129 128 131 115 First-year Residency Positions -435 448 411 378 382 362 372 365 346 321 CPM \"' Graduates -612 586 607 631 599 597 577 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1. 0 1. 0 1.0 1.0 1.0 Sources: Number of Residency Programs and First-year Residency Positions: Council on Pediatric Medical Education, APMA Number of CPM Graduates: Colleges of Pediatric Medicine Annual Reports to AACPM Office of Research and Policy Analysis, AACPM American Association of Colleges of Pediatric Medicine May 1987 University of Colorado Health Sciences Center School of Medicine A NATIONAL \"ASSOCIATE RESIDENT\" PROGRAM: AN ALL-PURPOSE SOLUTION Ttf HEALTH MANPOWER PROBLEMS Henry K. Silver, M.D. and Patricia A. McAtee, Ph.D. SUMMARY 4200 East Ninth Avenue Denver, Colorado 80262 I. PROPOSAL: We propose that the Council on Graduate Medical Education endorse the widespread utilization of \"associate residents\" to help resolve several of the nation's major health manpower problems. I I. WHO ARE \"ASSOCIATE RESIDENTS\"?: Associate residents are specially-prepared physician assistants and nurse practitioners who have received an additional short period of training in a specific medical specialty or subspeci alty. They have the skills and competence comparable to that of first year physician residents 'in providing much of the care and many of the services patients require. I II. WflAT WILL BE THE RESULT OF THE WIDESPREAD UTILIZATION OF ASSOCIATE RES !DENTS ? : A. When associate residents substitute on a one-to-one ratio for first year physician residents in training programs in specialties in which there are surpluses of practicing specialists, fewer physician houseofficers are required to provide the services needed for the care of hospitalized patients. Extensive utilization of associate residents in place of first year physician residents will produce an eventual reduction of thousands of available positions for residents with the result that many fewer residents will aquire the training to become practicing specialists. This, in turn, will produce a significant reduction in the oversupply of physicians. B. The presence of fewer specialists in practice will result in a cost saving of scores of millions of dollars. C. In housestaff training programs in which houseofficers are grossly overworked, adding associate residents to assist in providing patient care will enhance the quality of training of the physician houseofficers. D. In specialties with an undersupply of practicing specialists, associate residents could join physicians as their associates in practice to assist them in meeting unmet patient needs. E. Expansion of the role of nurse practitioners so they can function as associate residents will result in better utilization of nursing talent and increase recruitment and greater retention of registered nurses. IV. \\.!HAT STEPS ARE NOH NECESSARY TO FULLY IMPLEMENT A NATIONAL ASSOCIATE RES(DENT PROGRAM?: In addition to having the Council of Graduate Medicaf Education endorse the widespread utilizaton of associate residents, we recommend 1) the appo\u00b7intment of a national advisory committee to define the course of study and curriculae of programs to prepare associate residents and to define their functions and scope of practice; 2) establishing appropriate trairring programs to prepare associate residents; and 3) establishing a national clearing house for associate residents similar to the one presently in operation to place graduating medical students in appropriate resident training programs. CONCLUSION: The program we have described should be one of several solutions thatareutilized t.o solve the nation's health manpower problems. 7 ASSOCIATION OF ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION Public Hearing, November 19, 1987 Mr. Chairman and members of the council, I am Dr. Clayton Rich, Provost and Vice President for Health Scl.ences, Universl.ty of Oklahoma. I am also the chairman-elect of the Association of Academic Health Centers, and it is in this capacity that I am pleased to have the opportunity of presenting to you the views of the association's board of directors on a number of issues in front of this council. The board of directors is the elected governing body of the Associati.on of Academic Health Centers. The association represents approxl.mately one hundred American institutions of higher education, whose chief adml.nistrative officers --presidents, chancellors, vice presidents for health affairs and others -\u00ad share with the deans of their respective health professions schools (medicine, dentistry, nursing, etc.,) and with the directors of their principal teaching hospitals the responsibility for those institutions' educational, research and patient care missions, and for their fiscal stability. 1. FINANCING OF GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION With the introduction of the prospective payment system for Medicare patients, the Congress has reaffirmed the legl.timacy of fi.nancing medl.cal education through revenues for patl.ent services. We believe that thi.s method of financing is appropriate and should be continuer!, at least until a better method, assuring continuity of support from the public sector is agreer! upon by all interested parties. We also recognize the r!ifficulties the government 9 is experiencing in balancing the budget and have accepted reasonable limitations in the number of years of residency which ought to be financed under the Medicare program, As you know, these principles are embodied in current federal legislation. Each year we witness prolonged discussions in Congress and in the Administration as to the amount of Medicare and Medicaid funds to be provided and the formulae to be used to pay hospitals for the costs they incur because of graduate medical education programs. We watch these negotiations over payments with some trepidation, because the trend has been a decline in the level of support, leaving to the institutions the onus of bearing an ever-larger portion of the cost --a task which has become increasingly difficult at a time when competition prevails in the marketplace for health care services. Competition in the health care market, new technologies and, to some extent, the prospective payment system, have combined to change the pattern of health care delivery. Patients stay in the hospitals for a shorter time and those admitted are more seriously ill. The result is that the exposure of graduate medical students to the full range of patient care is no longer available solely through the inpatient hospital service. These circumstances, plus the application of new technologies that permit some diseases to be treated on an ambulatory basis, have made it necessary that graduate medical education programs, traditionally located in the teaching hospital, utilize ambulatory sites as well. 10 Medicare's mechanisms are geared primarily to pay for graduate medical education costs incurred by the hospitals and are inadequate for costs incurred by entities, other than hospitals, which provide ambulatory health care services. There is, therefore, a penalty to be paid in training students in ambulatory care programs not related to hospitals, even though primary care specialties, which require exposure to ambulatory practice, represent an area of great need in the overall manpower structure of our he,alth-care system. We urge the council to recommend that all graduate medical education programs, not just those paid by or through hospitals, should be included ln the mechanism for Medicare direct payments. The current Medlcare and Medicaid provisions, which rely primarily on payments through the secondary and tertiary care hospitals, should be modified accordingly. There have been suggestions that income derived from faculty practlce should be tapped for paying part of the cost of graduate medical education. As we stated above, we firmly believe funding of graduate medlcal education to be a societal responsibility and that a federal role in financing it should not be abdicated, It is also important to recognize that faculty practice income already pays for educational and research programs of many Institutions. 2. ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS The requirements for medical specialty certtfication are mandated by each of twenty-three specialty certifying hoards and twenty-three residency review committees. These bodies determine the length of time residents must spend in training and the nature and content of the graduate medical education 11 programs. These boards are not required to have their policy review~d or approved by any other authority. Recent actions lengthening the time required for certification and stipulating expansion of graduate medical education programs in areas such as clinical research, have been questioned by several organizations representing medical practitioners, hospitals and medical education. Our concern, as representatives of academic health centers, is that although our centers' hospitals and faculty provide the resources to conduct residency programs, these institutions have no input in the process. We believe that there should be a method for overall accountability, and that those who set the requirements for the residency programs should be obligated to take into account the consequences of decisions to increase certification requirements. In making these decisions there should be ways to evaluate the gain in education versus other factors; there should be consideration of the institutions where training takes place; there should be justification of the necessity for increased training, including pilot programs and longitudinal studies to demonstrate the essentiality of such requirements. I would emphasize that we are not suggesting regulating the boards --and we ~ would certainly oppose any government oversight in the educational process -- but rather that there should be opportunities for greater accountability in what entails commitment of the resources of educational institutions. 12 Academic health centers have responsibility for the education and training of many health professionals besides physicians. We are concerned with similar issues that are occurring in programs other than medicine. We believe that medicine, which consumes the lion's share of the teaching resources of our institutions, should set the example for responsible behavior. 3. FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES It has been the basic position of our organization that graduate medical education of students that have obtained a medical degree from schools not accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education or by the Bureau of Professional Education of the American Osteopathic Association should not be supported by Medicare and Medicaid funds unless these students' competence to enter our graduate medical education programs can be unequivocally established. We are concerned with two factors: quality and quantity. In our view, the issue is not one of rejecting foreign medical graduates by definition, but rather of maintaining the high quality of medical education in our country and of balancing the supply and demand of our health-care system with the output from LCME and BPE accredited schools. Quality. Given the diversity of the training programs from which foreign medical graduates come, there should be mechanisms for obtaining satisfactory evidence of the students' competence including language skills, and clinical ability --and not exclusively by way of written examinations which may or may not provide accurate means for evaluation. In the accredited schools these quality controls are exercised at the source by the process 13 which evaluates whether or not the training programs can be expected to produce competent graduates. Furthermore, the accreditation process examines whether the schools have in place adequate means for evaluating those who lOO complete the MD,sirogram: These schools do not rely entirely on one or two examinations, however comprehensive, but on the combination of examinations and continuous observation over a period of four years. The accreditation mechanism is not available to us to judge the adequacy of preparation of graduates of foreign medical schools. We urge the council to consider these questions and to propose solutions. However, we do not believe that it would be feasible for the LCME or the BPE to accredit foreign schools and this approach is not one we would support. Foreign medical graduates who wish to enter our graduate training programs should be required to demonstrate as much competence as those who come from accredited institutions. Another equally important aspect of the quality question is the concern that many hospitals that care for the poor depend on the service of foreign medical graduates in their residency programs. We strongly believe this to be wrong. Care of the poor should not be dependent on the availability of foreign medical graduates. Such a system condones dual standards which we reject. The poor should not be entrusted to the care of people whose qualifications are in doubt. Quantity. Unless there is a degree of control over the number of graduates that enter the United States from schools not approved by the LCME and BPE, it would be useless to talk about reducing the surplus in the output from our 14 accredited medical schools. It would not make sense to reduce enrollment in our medical schools with their well-defined system of quality control, without measures to stem the flow from outside. To conclude, I submit to this council that the issues presented above represent serious problems that need to be addressed. Second-class care, second-class training, abuse of the system, all need attention and individual solutions that are equitable and fair to all concerned. Thank you for your consideration. 15 The l\\ssociatior, of American Me:JLal Co~leges (AAt1C), a century-old organization comprised of the country's 127 accredited medical schools and their students; more than 400 of the major teaching hospitals in the United States, and 85 academic and professional societies whose members are engaged in undergraduate and graduate medical eaucation, patient care and biomedical research welcomes this opportunity to present its views on matters cognate to issues currently under consideration by the Council on Graduate Medical Education (CoGME). The composition of the AAMC makes obvious the Association's vital concern with the work of this Council. CoGME's statutory mandate is one of extraordinary breadth. The access to the President and to the Congress that it provides for your recommendations gives the Council the opportunity to wield enormous influence on the future of American medical education and, thereby, on the health of the American people. In the light of the serious responsibilities that CoGME has shouldered, the AAMC applauds your wise decision to seek, through these two days of open hearings, the views of\u00b7 individuals, institutions and organizations with goals and objectives cognate to the CoGME mission. Impelled by concerns similar to those that led the Congress to create CoGME---the aggregate supply of physicians for the U.S., their geographic and specialty distribution throughout the nation and the relationship of foreign medical graduates (FMGs) to the supply and distribution phenornena---the AAMC recently created a Task Force on Physician Supply that has been at work since May of 1987. The structure of this Task Force and the members of its Steering and four Working Cornrnittees---hereafter identified by the names of their 17 Chairmen---are , .. own in AttaChl'lent I. It is clear that the AAMC Task Force and CoGME are similarly organized. The simultaneous examination of these issues by CoGME---through the eyes of the federal government---and by the AAMC Task Force---from the point of view of medical education---offers an unusual opportunity for two independent bodies to illuminate and enrich each others deliberations. As a result, areas of consensus will be reinforced and those of divergence explicated with the clarity that results from mutual understanding of the specific reasons for disagreement. Such an outcome should be most useful to government, to academe and the public at large. For this reason, the AAMC is following CoGME's progess attentively. The Association deeply appreciates Dr. Vanselow's gracious acceptance of our request to report on CoGME's progress to a plenary session of the AAMC's Annual Meeting last week and welcome this opportunity to reciprocate. The Task Force and its Committees have been exploring the almost boundless terrain that the concept of ''physician supply'' opens. They are finding its topology complex and loci on its map interrelated in unexpected as well as expected ways. As yet, few conclusions have been reached or recommendations formulated. The program for the Association's annual meeting, held last week, was built around the theme of physician supply, with the intent of raising the consciousness of the entire community of medical educators to these issues and of giving the members of the Task Force the opportunity to interact with a broad spectrum of colleagues on this matter. At the outset it is important to emphasize that the AAMC brings a unique perspective to a set of issues before CoGME: that of the medical educator, whose vocation is to transform undifferentiated baccalaureates into polished 18 professional physicians. Tne members of our Association take enormous pride in what they have accomplished: o increased access to undergraduate and graduate education and the threefold rate of increase in production of physicians since the end of World War II; o provided more than half of the workforce for, and contributed at least proportionately to, the nation's spectacularly successful biomedical research effort; and o added immeasurably to the capacity of the medical profession to deal effectively with disease, disability and premature death. To medical educators, expanding is more congenial than limiting access to medical education; improving the environment for learning, more compelling than the mundane and practical considerations that predominate in today's public discussion. As our pluralistic society debates these issues of oroad general concern, ours must be the voice that insistently reminds the participants that sound medical education is the foundation undergirding the nation's health care system. This brings up the AAMC's first point, a mild demurrer from CoGME's 1st Principle that asserts that concern for the well being of the health professions, medical schools .. and teaching hospitals must be secondary to the primary concern of the Council for fhe health of the American people. The AAMC views these two objects of concerns---one dubbed primary, the other secondary--- while being related as being fundamentally different. One is an end; the other, a means to that end. It is not possible to have a healthy American people without healthy medical schools, healthy teaching hospitals, 19 a,,j well health professions. Therefore, the Association would have preferred that CoGME's 1st Principle recognized the cause-effect relationship of education to health. CoGME's Principle Nine speaks only to sufficient numbers of appropriately educated physicians. It does not, in the view of the AAMC, place the relationship between education and health status in proper perspective. While few conclusions or recommendations have been recorded by the AAMC Task Force, CoGME's Principle Five, favoring where possible, private sector solutions, struck a resonant note. Both the Farber and Rabkin Committees have concluded that individual voluntary decisions and choices, responsive to a wide range of incentives and disincentives, should play the major role in modulating physician supply and distribution at every stage in the educational process; and that informed decisions require the collection and publication, at timely intervals, of comprehensive and accurate trend data on all aspects of physician supply. This conclusion is implicit in the concept of a private sector solution, a process that the economists call \"perfecting the market''. A quick revieVI of the status of affairs with the Working Committees of the AAMC Task Force reveals the following. The AAMC's recently published report entitled \"Physicians for the Twenty-First Century, the Report of the Panel on the General Professional Education of the Physician and College Preparation for Medicine,\" and better known as the GPEP Report, was the distillate of a massive study of the character of medical education, the educational preparation for it and both the immediate and life-long educational requirements that the physician must meet. This Report has provided substantial impetus for fundamental changes in the prevailing concepts of what constitutes good medical education, The state of flux 20 inducerl by the GPEP Report has, in some ways, made even more complicated the task of Ur. Farber's group as it faces the many new, perplexing and first order questions encompassed in its charge. The Committee's review of data on physician supply clearly indicates that, since 1950, the number of physicians in active practice has increased more rapidly th~;1 the populatiun ~r.d tnat if the present rate of production is maintained, the number will continue to increase disproportionately for the next 25-30 years. The Committee is pondering issues that need illumination before judgements can be made about the meaning of supply data: o What effect on matriculants and graJuat~. ca11 be projected under various assumptions about the size and quality of the applicant pool and altered academic stanrlards for matriculation' o What constitutes an adequate supply of physicians under the medical as well as the socio-politico-economic circumstances likely to prevail during the next several decades? What are the advantages and disadvantages to patients, to physicians, to society, to the economy, to government of too many physicians? Are the answers to these questions, however important to other segments of society, a proper or central concern for medical educators? o How can the number of underrepresented minority physicians be increased, a question concordant with CoGME Principle Three. o Should the undergraduate education process deliberately seek to influence student preference between generalist and specialist modes of practice, and if so, by what means? 21 The Rabkin Committee, as it studies the impact of pl1ysician supply issues on residency training, is immersed in a plethora of issues that confront graduate medical education. For example, o the preservation of education as the primary and essential goal of residency training. o the development and financing of alternative mechanisms to meet service loads not properly assignable to residents. o the development and financing of high quality educational programs for residents in non-hospital settings. o the promotion of increased emphasis on primary care resident education to meet societal needs. The Rabkin Committee will undoubtedly build on the conclusions and recommendations of the several AAMC advisory committees that have plowed this terrain recently, particularly with respect to the financing questions. You may recall that the AAMC's Report by a Committee on Financing Graduate Medical Education issued in 1986, probed in depth a great many alternatives, but finally opted for maintaining the status quo on financing residency programs until a demonstrably better and fairer solution, with fewer downside risks, became available. Status quo, in this sense, means that residency program funding, in principle, conti-nues to be derived from hospital revenues through whatever period is prescribed by primary specialty boards as a precondition for board certification. The statutory Medicare adjustments that authorized one additional year of funding at full cost and additional years of residency or fellowship funding at half cost are acceptable political applications of that principle. Attachment II summarizes the Association's conceptual 22 framework and most recent official positions on the financing of graduate mediul education. The set of issues related to foreign medical students and graduates that fall within the purview of Dr. May's Committee include long-standing AAMC preoccupations about the basic competence of the nation's physician pool. A brief review of AAMC participation in activities related to foreign medical graduates is embodied in Attachment III. Students in the LCME-accredited schools that make up the AAMC are continuously under the close surveillance of a faculty whose education, experience and achievements are matters of record. The graduation of students by these faculties coupled with the performance of students on a nationally standardized examination provide assurance of tne competence of the graauates of our medical schools. A perennial problem has been how to measure the qualifications for entry into graduate medical education of physicians educated in the myriad foreign medical schools about which little is known. The Moy Committee is looking at the prevailing and proposed solutions, including hands-on clinical skills evaluation. It is also concerned: o about the acceptability of the education provided by GME programs that have not been attractive to American graduates and that have been able to recruit only FMGs, o about the needs of ttig large Hispanic populations in the USA for bilingual physicians; and o about the obligation of graduate medical education in the United States to meet the needs of foreign countries for specialist physicians and medical educators. 23 As an aside, it should be known that the deans and faculties of AAMC schools cringe at the very thought of limiting the access of able American students to first rate U.S. medical schools, while far less qualified students are provided ways for entering medical practice with credentials from recent-vintage for-profit Caribbean medical schools. The MMC was pleased to learn that CoGME did not endorse the proposal that a way be found for American accreditation of foreign medical schools. Finally, the AAMC Task Force has extended its scope beyond CoGME's to examine the future role of our academic medical centers in the education and training of biomedical scientists, a function inseparably linked to the conduct of biomedical research. The Korn Committee has affirmed the critical importance of both the research and the research training programs in the biomedical sciences conducted in our institutions: o to advance science; o to improve medical practice; and o to replenish faculty. The remarkable pace of advance in biomedical science in the last quarter century has exposed extraordinary vistas for progress against disease, disability and premature death, and the Committee has recommended that the Task Force strongly endorse axpanded Federal investments in biomedical research. It has also articulated the view that the research training components of the national scientific enterprise be maintained at least at current levels, irrespective of any adjustments in medical school programs and faculty numbers that may be indicated on the basis of physician supply issues. This Committee intends to develop a set of proposals and recommendations on 24 now to insure a steady flow of talented students into graduate education and training programs and on to research careers in the basic and clinical biomedical sciences. The AAMC hopes that this that this all-too-brief synopsis of the Association's views cognate to CoGME concerns clarifies its positions on these important issues that you are confrunL1ng. Tne AAMC will oe glad to answer any questions 25 TESTIMONY OF STANFORD A. ROMAN, M.D. DEAN OF THE MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE ATLANTA, GEORGIA BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION CONCERNING THE FEDERAL GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM ON NOVEMBER 19, 1987 27 Mr. Chairman, and members of the Council on Graduate Medical Education, I am pleased to appear before you today to discuss issues related to Graduate Medical Education. The Association of Minority Health Professions Schools is comprised of the Meharry Medical College's Schools of Medicine and Dentistry in Nashville, Tennessee, of which the distinguished Dr. David Satcher, who is a COGME councilor, is President; the Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School in Los Angeles, California; the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia; the Tuskegee University School of Veterinary Medicine in Tuskegee, Alabama; the Xavier University College of Pharmacy in New Orleans, Louisiana; the Florida A&M University College of Pharmacy in Tallahassee, Florida; and the Texas Southern University College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Houston, Texas. With the exception of the health professions schools of Howard University, our association represents all of the black health professions schools in the United states. Each of our institutions rely heavily upon federal institutional, research, and student aid support. The medical schools of our association that are affiliated with health care facilities and teaching hospitals are profoundly affected by federal policy related to Graduate Medical Education. The collective and individual goals of our institutions to increase the number of black and other minority health professionals in the nation will be affected greatly by the initiatives and recommendations established by your Council. 28 our institutions have made a significant historical contri bution to improving the health status of blacks and other minorities in the nation, and in increasing the number of black health professionals to serve in underserved minority communities. In fact, the eight schools of our association have trained 50% of the nation's black physicians, dentists and pharmacists, and 90% of the nation's black veterinarians. However, although blacks comprise roughly 12% of the U.S. population, only about 3% of the nation's physicians, dentists, and pharmacists are black, and only 2% of the nation's veterinarians are black. We are very proud of the\u00b7 accomplishments of our institutions in increasing the number of blacks in medicine and the other health professions, but the figures I have just cited demonstrate how far behind we still are. Those numbers also provide a reflection of just how fragile our national capability is to address the disparity in health status among blacks when compared to whites. If these schools had not been established, or if any of them were to close their doors, just imagine how much further we would be behind --much more than we are right now. In 1985, then Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Margaret Heckler released the HHS Task Force Report on Black and Minority Health that confirmed the critical health status disparity that exists in this country among blacks when compared to whites. A black infant is twice as likely to die in its first year than is a white infant. Adjusted for age, 60,000 excess deaths 29 occur among blacks each year than compared to whites, and life expectancy for blacks is much lower for blacks than whites. In fact, in my home state of Georgia, in some rural counties, the life expectancy for blacks is less than that of blacks in Kenya, Africa. The HHS Secretary's task force report refocused the nation's attention on these critical disparities, and set the tone for a national commitment to improve this woeful situation. Unfortu\u00ad nately, federal policy has been slow in responding to the recommendations of the report. A cornerstone recommendation of the task force report advised that one of the best methods of improving health status among blacks and other minorities is to increase the number of minority health professionals to meet the desperate health care needs of this underserved population. Various studies have been completed, one most noteable was prepared by Dr. Steven Keith who now serves as health adviser to Senator Kennedy's Human Resources Committee, that demonstrates that minority physicians are much more likely than their majority counterparts to serve in primary care specialties, in underserved areas. A survey of Meharry Medical School graduates confirms that 75% continue on to serve in underserved areas. The major point I wish to make by this discussion is that, as a nation we are faced with a glaring, unforgivable health status disparity among blacks when compared to whites. A fundamental means of addressing this disparity is to establish a national commitment 30 to significantly increase the representation of blacks and other minorities in medicine and other health professions, and eliminate the barriers that prevent bright young blacks from seeking health professions careers. This special national situation calls for a special federal response in terms of policy, financi~g, and support. Several issues that the Council has asked organizations to comment on regarding manpower are of concern to our association. The Council asks these questions: Q: Assuming a continuation of current policies and present trends, what conclusions can be drawn about the adequacy of the expected supply of physicians over the next two decades? AMHPS A: If current policy continues, our association believes there will be continued under-representation of minorities in the health professions, and continued declining enrollment and acceptance rates of blacks and other minorities in health profes\u00ad sions schools. The supply of physicians will continue to reflect an oversupply of highly paid specialists, and an undersupply of those willing to provide primary care in underserved areas. Q: What policy changes in the public and private sectors are recommended to deal with any projected imbalances in physician supply? 31 AMHPS A: Foremost, is to remove the existing financial barriers that prevent, or discourage young bright individuals who are willing to serve in underserved areas from seeking health professions education. As well, reward teaching hospitals for emphasizing programs that train individuals to practice primary care in underserved areas. Further, expand Graduate Medical Education reimbursement to ambulatory settings to encourage patient care teaching in these important surroundings. And, better reward those health care institutions that treat a disproportionate share of poor people, thus not deriving a substantial revenue base from patient care. Q: What impact will these recommendations have on the quality of health care, costs, access, minority representation, and physician function? AMHPS A: Our association believes that implementation of the policies I have just recommended will facilitate an increase in the number of minorites in medicine and other health professions, serving in primary care in underserved areas. It should go without saying that access to care will be improved significantly by these recommendations, and that can only lead to better quality, lower costs, and improved health status among blacks and other minor\u00ad ities. 32 The Association of Minority Health Professions Schools urges that the Council on Graduate Medical Education make a sincere, concerted effort to recommend changes in Graduate Medical Education policy that will increase the numbers of minorities in medicine and provide improved patient care at teaching hospitals. Finally, we urge that the COGME closely review our national needs for the future, and present policy options to address our health professions, and health care needs for those years. Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools. I am pleased to respond to any questions you may have. 33 THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MEDICAL MINORITY EDUCATORS TESTIMONY BEFORE TBE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION NOVEMBER 19, 1987 Prepared by: P. M. Lowrie, Presiden+. NAMME College of Veterinary Medicine Michigan State University Presented by: Arthur Boyte, M. D. School of Medicine Georgetown University NAMME Advisory Committee: Robert Rivers, M. D. School of ~edicine and Dentistry University of kochester Vivian Penn, M. D. College of Medicine Howard University Barbara Ross Lee, D. 0. College of Osteopathic Medicine Michigan State University 35 The National Association of Medical Minority Educators Testimony before the Council on Graduate Medical Education November 19, 1987 The National Association of Medical Minority Educators (NAMHE) appreciates this opportunity to address the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGHE), for we feel it is imperative that recommendations made to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Buman Services relative to physician manpower without evidence of a strong commitment to minorities and the medically underserved fail to accurately reflect those issues ~hat should impact policy. We concur with the those COGME principles that conclude that solutions developed without consideration of specific reference to targeted groups risk ignoring the barri'ers to access in graduate medical education, currently the experience of minorities. The barriers to access include the high cost of medical education; the high competition for specialty residencies; the lack of uniform affirmative action within medical school graduate education programs; and minority underrepresentation among medical school faculty resulting in few role models and mentors. We can not discuss these barriers in isolation. Not only are there comparatively few successes in residency placements, but there are comparatively few minority medical school graduates to seek placement. Graduation rates of minority students are influenced by similar factors to those that influence low numbers in graduate programs. In addition, Luke and Tudor conclude in their report on The Differential Analysis of U. S. Medical Schools with High and Low Minority Graduation Rates (September 1987) that students are affected by financial obligations, levels of academic preparedness and external family pressures. The academic preparation includes MCAT performance, especially in the quantitative and reading test, which are important measures in determining success in the completion of medical school. Intervention along the entire length of the educational pathway improves the potential for greater numbers of minorities to compete for and be successful in residency training programs. Factors related to financial status significantly impact the initial choice of medicine as a career as well as the selection of specialty. We are well aware of the direct consequence of high indebtedness; \u00b7but, there are the indirect cost as well. The most obvious indirect cost is the foregone earnings resulting from the lack of gainful employment during many years of education. The high cost of medical education creates financially more compromised medical minority school graduates, who find themselves unable to access residencies at rates comparable to that of their majority counterparts. This high cost of medical education plus the delayed earning potential 36 diminishes the prospects of attracting numbers of minority students \u00b7 seeking medicine. Repayment of loans during the residency years is an added financial burden to an already financially overburdened minority medical student. Since minority practitioners can only survive and thrive serving their respective minority populations, and since the need for minority practitioners is best demonstrated in their respect.ive minori\u00b7t.y population, it is not surprising that the financial burdens of medical education are even further compounded by practice site selection of medical minority graduates, usually into areas of poorer earning potential. Thus, the early years of practice with relatively large educational debt and a less lucrative forecast for earning potential is financially difficult to manage. All of which, not surprisingly, serve as a disincentive for minorities selecting medicine. Nonetheless, the small pool of minority residents comprise a unique group of individuals, They, given access and removal of barriers', not only will serve the medically underserved, but they wish to serve them. Therefore, decreasing minority representation in graduate medical training programs directly impacts the recognized area of increasing health care delivery need which exist in the medically underserved populations. According to the most recent medical education report (JAMA, August 1987), black, non-Hispanic medical residents have remained around 4.5% for the last several years, in the face of marginal increases in medical school enrollment from 1986 to 1987, of 5.3% to 5.8% respectively. The numbers of other underrepresented minorities has either remained stable or declined. There is also a disproportionate underrepresentation in acquiring placement among all resident specialty offerings. Over the last three years blacks have declined in 15 of 28 specialty areas of residency training. What is of greater interest is that a decline in first year appointments of FMGs and an increase in new residency programs, did not translate into and increase in minority, blacks specifically, representation on a percentage basis. It is interesting to note that with no appreciable increase in minority representation, the ability to serve any given population is also compromised. In the open market place, there will be few to treat the medically underserved in subspecialty areas, such a~ n~~natology, or colon and rectal surgery. These two specialty examples are illustrative of anticipated delivery needs based on changing minority population demographics i.e. an increase in births and an dramatic increase in the aged. In fact census projections indicate that the black and Hispanic population is expected to increase to approximately 30% by the year 2030, while the number of black and Hispanic physicians is not projected to grow proportionately. Achieving solutions to these problems must programs that take into account the need to finance positions for minority graduates. 37 include affirmative promote, protect and The country should have a vested interest in this human resource. There should be enthusiastic support for expanding opportunities. But, those opportunities will remain limited until minority representataion on academic policy making bodies such as admissions, promotions, and residency selection committees is achieved. However, increasing academic role models is only a partial response. While it is true that a more supportive environment will address some of the problems, role models without a strong institutional commitment accomplishes very little, for the establishment of a cadre of role models is also dependent upon access to graduate medical education. In addition to the need for aggressive affirmative action programs in residency training, a more aggressive approach to financially assist in the cost of a medical education is also needed. Basically, poor students who become physicians take care of poor patients and receive poor money. The system must recognize this and reinstate programs that promote loan forgiveness. Certainly, the financial burden will continue to negatively influence young people if left unchecked. In conclusion, COGME must maximize this unique opportunity to bring to reality the quote from the fhvsicians for the 21st Century: report of the Panel on the General Professional Education of the Phvsician and College Preparation for Medicine, \"The opportunity to study medicine should be available to qualified individuals regardless of their sex, race, ethnic origin or financial status.\" NAMME's members, as faculty and administrators at health professions schools and who have direct reponsibility for minority issues, supports innovative approaches to accomplishing this objective. Blacks, Hispanics and other minorities must enjoy all rights anu privileges of this profession. Through diversity in representation true excellence is achieved. Providing excellence in health care to a diverse population enhances excellence as a nation. In closing we quote Sojourner Truth who said, \"We do as much; we eat as much; we want as much. Thank you. 38 1. REFERENCES Luke , W . L Schools with High and Low Minority Graduation Rates: Final Report. Division of Medicine, Bureau of Health Professions, DH9S, Rockville, Md. 1987. 2.

We appreciate this and every opportunity to contribute to the policy-making process regarding graduate medical education. As future physicians, we will be directly affected by changes in medical specialty training. In effect, we are that \"expected supply of physicians\" which the Council is scrutinizing. AMSA is particularly interested in the issues before this committee because of our long-standing interest in enriching medical education and assuring access to quality health care for all. These commitments are evidenced by our involvement in initiating the National Health Service Corps, our development of a Health Promotion/Disease Prevention program wpich places students in medically underserved areas for an internship, and our study groups on for-profit medical care and the financing of medical education, and much more. 41 We would like to start by thanking the Council for its careful and thoughtful work in assessing the problems before us. Indeed many of AMSA's greatest concerns are already reflected in your proposed recommendations. You have pointed out the need for more primary care practitioners, the geographic maldistribution that exists, the need to recruit more minority students to medical fields, and the importance of altering manpower projections as the needs of society and the composition of the physician population change. There are two related questions that we would like to address. First, is there a role for the U.S. government in financing graduate medical education (GME)? Second, how should we address the manpower needs of the nation, especially as related to health manpower shortage areas (HMSAs) and primary care in the face of an overall physician surplus? Let me begin by rephrasing the first question. Instead of asking, \"Is there a role for the U.S. government in financing GME?\", let us ask, \"How else will we deliver the health care now provided by interns and residents, particularly the 75% of indigent care that our residents now supply?\" How else can we insure an adequate supply of primary care physicians? Are we doing our best at both of the above? 42 Clearly we are not doing our best at providing care to the indigent or insuring an adequate supply of primary care physicians. Despite the fact that we spend a larger percentage of our gross national product on health care than any other country, our mortality statistics are strikingly similar to a developing country. The United States ranks 15th in male life expectancy, 7th in female life expectancy, and 14th in infant mortality. The black infant mortality rate is twice that for the white population. As the COGME manpower sub-committee has stated, there is a physician surplus in some specialty and geographic areas, yet there is a dearth of primary care givers, in particular, family practitioners. This shortage is accentuated in HMSAs. According to the Bureau of Health Professions 1987 figures, over 3 million urban and rural Americans live in HMSAs and do not have access to even the most basic care. From our perspective as medical students, we see the geographic maldistribution as a reflection of the very personal choices that young physicians make as they complete their residencies. These observations are illustrated in a recent study by Langwell et al1 They showed that certain community characteristics like higher educational resources, higher socioeconomic markers, available health services, and climate determine which underserved communities are able to 43 attract young physicians. In short, \"many areas are unattractive to physicians, and they will continue to have a shortage of physicians\" in spite of physician surpluses. This work only weakly supported Newhouse's hypothesis that a surplus of physicians will result in a diffusion into HMSAs.2 According to Langwell: Fifty-eight percent of non-metropolitan countries gained one or more young physicians (in the period studied, 1974 to 1978), 42% did not. Nearly 60% of counties that did not gain a physician had populations under 10,000. AMSA agrees with the manpower sub-committee's determination that there may be a shortage of primary care physicians. However, it seems anomalous that COGME would indicate that there is an oversupply of physicians in pediatrics when nearly one-third of the nation's 35 million medically indigent patients are children. As the number of pediatricians increases, it seems appropriate to develop incentives to direct and encourage physicians to serve children in need. As we grapple with the issues above, we must also address the question of quality medical education. You have stated in the recommended COGME principles that medical education is secondary to the health care needs of our citizens. We feel that this may be so in the short run, but quality health care for the people of the United States is dependent on quality medical education for physicians. We must insure that this education stresses the importance of social and ethical issues, clinical competence, and a responsibility to serve the community. These issues have already been studied in depth by GPEP (1984) and many others. AMSA sees no need for further study, but a call for action. The second question we wish to addess is \"How should we address the manpower needs of the nation, especially as related to HMSAs and primary care in the face of an overall physician surplus?\" Keith, et al.4, showed that minority physicians tend to practice in HMSAs in greater proportions than their white contemporaries (12% to 6%). Yet despite the proposed goal of having 16% minority enrollment by 1975, the latest AAMC data show that minorities comprised only 8.9% of the entering class last year (an increase of only 0.6% over the last decade). 5 Perhaps more telling is the fact that between 1976 and 1986, the majority applicant pool decreased by 27.6%, while the minority applicant pool decreased by only 3.6%. In spite of this, during the same period, the minority applicant's chance of being accepted relative to a majority student declined. This data seems to indicate that minority students 45 are applying to medical school in adequate numbers despite the lack of faculty role models and general social support structures. In addition, the cost of medical education is skyrocketing. According to AAMC data, the average indebtedness of a medical school graduate in 1987 was over $36,000. Financing options for low and even moderate income students are limited. The increasing reliance on high interest HEAL loans is increasing the student's debt burden still further. Our fear that students will opt for higher paying non\u00ad primary care specialties and more financially rewarding locations in order to meet their loan payments is supported in part, by an AMA study conducted by Gloria Bazzoli.6 She showed that as the proportion of debt that is HEAL-based increases, the proportion of residents planning to pursue primary care declines. AMSA also shares the concerns of Steven Shea, et al.7, that the increasing debt burden may discourage low income and minority applicants from applying to medical school in the first place. RECOMMENDATIONS Our federal government must take a stronger pro-active role in solving these problems. Our country needs and deserves a unified program which insures the delivery of quality primary care and preventive measures to our medically 46 indig.ent population, an adequate supply of primary care physicians and quality graduate medical education. History provides no evidence that the private sector is willing to adequately address these problems, and there is no reliable way of guranteeing they will take on this responsibility in the future. Financial incentives should be put into place which: 1) support and reimburse cognitive skills to the same level as technical and procedural skills. 2) Promote primary care by providing financial support for medical education in the primary care setting. A relative value scale for reimbursement in the Medicare and Medicaid programs would lead the way for insurance companies to do the same. In addition the federal government must guarantee sufficient financial support to primary care residencies so as to provide adequate numbers of primary care physicians. 3) Reward residencies which emphasize out-patient clinical training, stress preventive medical skills and improve resident working conditions thereby insuring quality patient care. This should include incentives to hire ancillary help to reduce the resident \"non-medical\" workload and to decrease the total hours worked per week to reduce chronic fatigue. As a nation we must reaffirm our commitment to recruiting physicians for HMSAs. The National Health Service Corps is 47 an excellent way to do this, but the Corps and its recruiting mechanisms are grossly under-funded at this time. The Corps was recently reauthorized by Congress, but funding was denied for a new loan repayment program, not for lack of popular support in Congress, but because of the timing of the authorization relative to the appropriation bill. The NHSC and other loan forgiveness programs for those willing to serve in underserved areas or in primary care simply must be funded. Additionally, there is a role for the federal government to play in assuring that greater numbers of minorities and other students from HMSAs enter the medical education system. These young people must be provided with the primary and secondary education they need to intellectually support a medical career. They must have financial and social supports to enable them to attend college and medical school. Medical students generally should not be forced to incur prohibitive debt loads which prevent them from practicing in the low income HMSAs. Our Congress has the responsibility to insure that equitable programs with equal access in all states are put in place to do this. Thank you for your time. P.

ASSOCIATE COUNSEL TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION BY JANET FREEDMAN, M.D. PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE OF INTERNS AND RESIDENTS 51 :ESTIMONY BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION BY JANET FREEDMAN, M.D. PRESIDENT, COMMITTEE OF INTERNS AND RESIDENTS As President of the Committee of Interns and Residents, the union representing over 5,000 physicians-in-training in New York, New Jersey and Washington D.C, I am pleased to be here today. Over the years, residents have consistently advocated for im- provements in the conditions of our work and the quality of care we deliver. Given the major changes proposed for residency programs, now more than ever, we are compelled to see that our interest and our patients' interests are addressed. Over the last 50 years, health care delivery has undergone a \"revolution. The amount of medical knowledge and almost daily changes in available technology have dramatically increased the demands on residents. Cost-containment strategies have created a myriad of paperwork. More acutely ill patients utilizing shorter hospital stays, combined with new diseases such as AIDS, have created a much more stressful and complicated work environment for physicians-in-training today. Yet, our system of training physicians has not kept pace. It has been the public -not the medical profession -which has in- 1tiated major changes. Congress examined its reimbursement sys- tems for financing residency programs and established this Coun- 52 cil to propose changes. A New York grand jury investigation into a patient's death and a California state senator have challenged the quality of patient care provided by doctors working 36 hour shifts. As each sector of our society affected by both the cost of and quality of our healthcare delivery proposes solutions and changes in their own interest, it is the role of government to protect the priorities of our society as a whole. The federal government, and Congress in particular, has a leading role to play in a review of the structure and content of residency programs. However, public decision makers have serious miscon- ceptions about residency programs. An essential task of this Council, comprised almost entirely of doctors, is to advise Congress about who residents are and what we do, and to propose policies that accurately reflect the work of residents and the quality of health care they are able to provide to their patients. What do residents do? 1. We do work. Lots of it. We provide essential medical services in the largest hospitals in the nation. The term \"graduate medical education\" is a misnomer. It creates ah illu\u00ad sion in the minds of the public and public officials that we are passive recipients of classroom education at the expense of 53 patients and taxpayers. We are already physicians and are in training to become specialists. We have already completed 4 years of undergraduate education and 4 years of medical school. We spend 901 of our time in direct patient care, wo~king 90-100 hours a week1 and often more. 2. We do work on the most cost-efficient basis. No other health professional works as cheaply as we do. First-year resi- dents earn a national average of 821,000, or little more than $4.00 an hour for their 100-hr. workweek. Substitution of our services is a very costly matter. The Health and Hospitals Cor- poration in New York City estimated a cost of 820 million to hire 1200 non-physician ancillary staff to replace resident labor if the proposed hours reduction took effect. 3. We do work that fills a societal void -providing the bulk of medical care to the nation's poor. The private voluntary teaching hospitals provide two times the bad debt/charity care of non-teaching hospitals. Public hospitals provide three times more.1 What do these facts mean for policy-setting? First, we could not as a nation fulfill our mission of 1. New England Journal of Medicine: Vol. 313, No. 3, p161l 54 providing quality health care to all Americans without the medi~ cal services provided by residents in teaching hospitals. appropriate, therefore, to maintain Medicare funding for residency programs, and patient. care revenues as the proper source of that funding, It is Second, there is one particular group of physicians who fill that societal responsibility more than any other -graduates of foreign medical schools. FMGs are concentrated in inner city hospitals. They go where their USMG colleagues have refused to go, both during residency and afterwards, That is a fact. However, it is a myth that these doctors are more poorly trained and provide medical care of lesser quality. Rather than dis\u00ad criminate on the basis of place of medical education, CIR has ad\u00ad vocated for one examination for all medical graduates. We are pleased with the similar recommendation of the Subcommittee on Foreign Medical Graduates. Third, as providers of health care services, physician training and medical research, our teaching hospitals are vital to our national system of health care delivery -now and for the future. The differential system for reimbursement to teaching hospitals is the right approach, and should be refined to further provide incentives for resident physicians to train and work in the areas most needed by society -socio-economically, geographi\u00ad cally and by specialty. 55 Fourth, this Council must be careful in calling for private sector solutions which ignore the solutions currently bej.ng provided by the public sector. It is the public sector which sees health care for all as its mission, and i~ is through public money that the private sector can be influenced to carry its share. WithoOt comprehensive solutions, however, the public sector can't really fill that void in health care delivery. The call for some form of national health program is being issued through- out the country. Health Care policy makers need to hear it. I have hardly deluged you with statistical data - I am sure others will do so. That data will be misinterpreted, however, unless this Council provides for Congress an accurate framework of the role of residents and teaching hospitals in our nation's health care delivery system. Thank you for the opportunity to address you. I ~ I 56 TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION BY DAVID MARDER, M.O., PRESIDENT NATIONAL FEDERATION OF HOUSESTAFF ORGANIZATIONS I am Or. David Marder, President of The National Federation of Housestaff Organizations. Our member organizations are leaders in their hospitals, their communities, and their states in improving residency programs and patient care. I am pleased to represent these efforts on a national level. On behalf of the NFHO, I welcome this opportunity today to share our ideas with you. Two years ago, our efforts, among others, halted the wanton and thoughtless cuts proposed for the funding of residency programs. COBRA established guidelines for funding and the formation of this Council. Like many others, we saw this as an opportunity to formulate a policy which would make the needed reforms systematically and gradually, encoura~ing physicians to train and work in fields that society needs most. As my colleague, Dr. Janet Freedman, previously noted: residents provide much of the acute medical care to the nation's poor. Thus, the needed comprehensive restructuring of r~sidency programs must occur in the context of developing a national health program that provides access to quality care for all 57 Americans. In the meantime, the following reforms make essential steps in that direction. I propose that the Council take these proposals as guidelines and use your staff and resources to develop them for Congress. One of the underlying reasons for the cuts to residency programs is the premise that this nation has too many doctors. As COGME's Subcommittee on Physician Manpower points out, the essential answer to be sought in addressing this lies in solving the problem of the maldistribution of doctors --geographically, socio-economically and by specialty. In order to influence the specialties and locations in which physicians choose to train and work, Congress should set funding priorities to certain teaching hospitals, to certain specialties and to programs which fill certain criteria. In particular: 1. Residency programs in hospitals which serve a disproportionate share of the medically indigent should be funded at a higher rate than those in other hospitals. Public municipal teaching hospitals and private voluntary hospitals in medically underserved areas provide medical service to the nation's poor, a service not du.pl ica ted by other\" hospitals. Just as Congress mandated the disproportionate share 58 adjustment to DRG payments, it should assign a similar adjustment to direct and indirect payments for the funding of residency programs. Such positions should be weighted at a higher level just because they are in these hospitals. Provisions should be made which target the funding to improving the salaries, benefits, working conditions, and training aspects of these residency programs, thereby enticing residents to choose these hospitals. 2. Residency programs which train physicians in primary care medicine and programs which train physicians in specialties where there is a shortage should receive funding at a higher rate than subspecialties. In 1985, the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment heard a proposal which gave phased-in incentives for primary care and disincentives for subspecialty training. The proposal had some specific problems, but the general idea addressed the maldistribution of physicians by speciality. In that approach, medical and surgical subspecialties were seen as the logical place, within the framework of Medicare funding of residency programs, from which to shift money away. For purposes of further investigation, we propose family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, ob/gyn, preven-tive medicine, and occupational medicine as primary care specialities; and psychiatry, geriatrics and rehabilitation medicine as 59 specialties where there is a shortage. Some subspecialty residency programs are called \"fellowships\"; others retain the name ''residency.\" Many doctors working as fellows or as sub-specialty residents spend most of their time doing work essential to the hospital's ability to deliver services. Thus, the disproportionate share adjustment must apply here as well. Hospitals in medically underserved areas should get enticements for fellows to come there. In these areas, the fellows are often the only subspecialists to whom these patients have access. 3. Residency programs which have a significant portion of their training in out-patient, ambulatory care settings should be funded at a higher rate. Clinics and other outpatient facilities are important sites of medical training and practice. We encourage the phase-in of funding for such training sites. This will encourage the building of ambulatory/primary care services in areas where the teaching hospital emergency room is the neighborhood doctor's office. One of the results of the concentration of U.S. medicine in the acute care medical centers and in subspecialties is the breakdown of the primary care network. Nowhere is this more obvious.than in medically underserved areas. For example, New York City's public hospitals provide over 5 million outpatient visits a year to the city's poor and near poor. These same 60 hospitals often work at over 100% bed capacity -if guerneys in the halls are counted. The shift from emphasizing acute speciality medicine to primary ambulatory care needs to be done a step at a time. In the. meantime, before such a network is built, we must continue to support the care where it is currently provided -in the teaching hospitals. 4. Residency programs which have a viable affirmative action policy should be funded at a higher rate than those which do not. Studies indicate again and again that minority physicians are much more likely to serve minority patients. And a disproportionate share of the medically indigent are minority. The number of minority U.S. medical students and residents is dropping. Thus, it is clearly in the best interests of the medical community -both ethically and fiscally -to support residency programs which have demonstrated a commitment to train minority physicians. This Council has a unique opportunity to recommend that Congress provide funding priorities to residency programs comprised of doctors who serve the specialties, the hospitals and the communities with the patients of greatest need. Orr behalf of the National Federation of Housestaff Organizations, I encourage you to take that opportunity. Thank you. 61 Testimony before The Council on Graduate Medical Education November 19, 1987 Submitted by Ruth S. Hanft 63 Introduction I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Council as an individual to present my personal views on a number of issues related to the supply, distribution, education, costs of education, graduate medical education and financing of this education for physicians. As a long-time observe~ researcher and commentator of the health pro- fessions education field, I see the following issues and problems as major ones. Concerns based on the GMENAC report that there is a surplus of physicians, which may not be the case; Continued maldistribution of physicians by specialty and geography; Decline in minority, particularly black, enrollment in medical schools, and barriers to attendance by low-income students; Dysfunction between education of physicians and societal need; Rate of increase in costs of medical education; Current financing of graduate medical education which undermines the goals of increasing the supply of primary care physicians and non-hospital training; The critical importance of graduate medical education financing in cross-subsidizing indigent care; Data issues and problems (described briefly in Appendix I). 64 There are other major issues that are important and interdigitate with the above, but which may be more appropriate to another forum. These include the missions of the academic health centers and the interplay of missions, curriculum, faculty role models, etc. Supply The GMENAC report based on data and projections from the late 1970s predicted a surplus of physicians. Many of the assumptions that underlie the initial estimates have changed. In addition, there is no precise methodology in any field to project manpower need. Let me just deal with some of the changes that have occurred and some of the unknowns. Changes Productivity is changing. The increase in HMO and salaried physicians changes productivity. Physicians in these settings work fewer hours and see fewer patients. The number of women in medicine is rising rapidly. Numerous studies show significant differences in women's practice styles, fewer patients and shorter careers. Two-earner professional families have also influenced productivity. There is also anecdotal evidence of earlier retirements of the current physician pool. Demographics of the population: Projections of the size of the elderly population increase ann,,~11\". The over-85 population is the fastest growing population group with substantially higher utilization rates than any other group. While it is possible that our ethical standards for keeping people alive when quality of life has ended will change, it is unlikely in the near term. In addition, as further breakthroughs in treatment and prevention of cardiovascula~ cerebrovascular illness and cancer continue, the aging trends will accelerate. The baby boom population will reach their fifties 65 within the next decade. As you are aware, chronic illness begins to increase rapidiy when individuals reach their fifties. If the emerging improvements in prevention and treatment continue, all population projection trends will need to be altered. Utilization: Recent Medicare data indicate a sharp increase in utilization of physician services and home health services. Part of this is due to the emphasis to shift services to out-of-hospital care and to reductions in length of stay, but part is a real increase in utilization, whether or not appropriate. Utilization will continue to increase as the baby boomers reach fifty, unless we begin serious technology assessment and utilization review. AIDS is an unknown potential. In cities with high incidence, AIDS has begun to swamp resources. Technology: We simply do not know the future impact of technology developments on life span or utilization of services. If these developments are new vaccines, they may reduce future utilization. If midway technologies like artificial organs, they will increase utilization. Financing: Financing clearly has an effect on utilization. There are 35 to 37 million people who are uninsured. Efforts are being made to extend coverage to these groups of people with unmet needs. We may well develop a universal private/public financing program in the 1990s. The effects of such a program are bound to increase utilization. Other Unmet Needs: There are numerous functions and sites of care that are not adequately staffed by physicians. These include: mental hospitals, developmental disabilities facilities, prisons, public health clinics. There are numerous subgroups of the population that are not being reached, such as the homeless, teenaged pregnant women. If we are really serious about technology 66 assessment and appropriateness review, these functions also require physician manpower. Well-trained clinical researchers with M.D. degrees continue to be in short supply. In other fields with surplus, unemployment is notable. I know of no increase in unemployment among physicians nor precipitous drops in income. It may be a little harder to get started, harder to locate geographically or in first choice of practice setting, but there are no major economic dislocations. I am not advocating building supply to create unemployment, but I am urging caution in terms of reducing supply versus future anticipated needs. It would be unfortunate if enrollment were cut deliberately now and we woke up in 2010 to find ourselves back in the position of the fifties and sixties. There will be some natural decline in enrollment due to the demographics of the population, but deliberate reductions are a different matter. While I have been told that some institutions have not been able to recruit enough qualified applicants to fill their first-year classes, I am dubious. A number of institutions have in the past taken \"so-called high risk students\" with great success. It is also clear that a number of schools have not been \"recruiting\" students. I urge LCME and the medical education community to review their criteria for accreditation and admission to assure that barriers are not erected to limit access to people who will make fine community physicians in the future. In fact, some commentators believe that current selection processes contribute to the emphasis on specialty rather than primary care emphasis. Perhaps if some of the criteria were changed, more students qualified and interested in primary care could be recruited. 67 Mal distribution There are still medically underserved areas of the country, particularly rural and inner city areas. Furthennore, data from a number of states indicate the rapid aging of the rural physician pool with little sign of replacement. In terms of primary care physicians, no matter how the counts are made, less than half of the physicians are primary care physician~ and less than half the physicians in residency programs are in primary care training. There is a clear mismatch between perceived needs and reality. Part of the problem may be in the financial constraints of financing outpatient based primary care training in internal medicine, pediatrics and family medicine. Part may be the differential income potential between cognitive and procedure oriented specialties based on current UCR fee structures. In any case, the goal over the last fifteen years to increase primary care physicians is as far off as it was then. There are a number of actions that can be taken to increase the balance of primary care physicians versus specialists. These include the following types of actions, some of which will be described in greater detail later. o Further reduce Medicare direct payments for specialty training and increase them for primary care and place the saved funds in a pool for distribution for primary care and outpatient training; o Charge tuition for all subspecialty training; with tuition possibly structured on a combination of need for the subspecialty and future income potential; o Increase other direct grant support for primary care outpatient training in internal medicine, pediatrics and family medicine; o Urge the RRCs to review requirements in medicine and pediatrics, e.g., does the length of the requirement for neonatal intensive care training in pediatrics make sense for co11111unity pediatrics; 68 o Stimulate the growth of the joint general medicine, general pediatrics programs; o Restructure physician fees under Medicare and Medicaid to increase the relative values of time and cognitive services versus procedures. Minorities and Low-Income Students Whatever gains were achieved by the mid seventies in terms of enrollment and retention of minorities in medical school have steadily eroded. The latest data show that blacks constitute 6.1 percent of medical school enroll\u00ad ment including those repeating the first year and Hispanics 3.9 percent of enrollees. Five percent of the recent graduates were black, and 3.4 percent were Hispanics. There has been a growing disparity between acceptance rates of whites and blacks in the past several years. In 1986, 55 percent of all students who applied were accepted, but only 44 percent of blacks who applied were accepted, showing a shift in the acceptance proportions over time. While there are many complex reasons for the failure to increase minorities and blacks in particular, there are serious consequences in terms of service goals as well as equal education opportunity goals. Minority physicians are more likely to serve in underserved areas and to serve minority populations. There is a clear relationship between the availability of minority physicians and access to care. Preliminary data show increasing difficulty for low-and lower-income students to attend medical school because of the rising costs of education and the decreasing availability of scholarships and loans. This is an increasingly serious problem in terms of equal educational opportunity, 69 future specialty and geographic distribution of physicians. High debt levels of those who attend medical schools may influence selection of higher earning specialties and act as a further disincentive to entering primary care specialties and locating in less affluent inner city\u00b7and rural areas. While tuition represents a very small proportion of medical school revenues it continues to rise and is substantially higher than tuition in many graduate fields. Added to undergraduate tuition which is also rising, without subsidized loans and scholarships it becomes a major barrier for lower or moderate income students. There are a number of actions that could be taken to increase the pool of qualified minority students. All of them require active commitment and participation of the nation's medical schools. These include but are not limited to: o Linkages between medical schools and \"magnet high schools\" with large minority enrollments; o Assistance by the medical schools to the historically black colleges to improve science instruction and provide tutorials to promising students; o Special remedial and advanced summer programs sponsored by the medical schools in high schools and colleges for minority students; o Return to remedi?l orograms and tutorials for students accepted to medical school but who have gaps in earlier education; o Continuation of special support to minority health professions institutions. Clearly the above require special funding. There are other actions that require no new direct funding. These include: 70 o Increase in NIH surrmer fellowships for minority college and medical students; o Renewed medical school efforts to recruit mir.crity faculty and special programs (sabbaticals, NIH visiting scholars) to enhance skills; o Increase in medical school recruitment efforts to enroll minority students. I find it remarkable that a small number of schools have consistently maintained high minority enrollment while the majority of schools have records that can be regarded in many cases as abysmal. Finally, student financing is critical. We must return to full scholarships for low-income students, and subsidized loans for lower middle income students. Dysfunction between Education of Physicians and Societal Needs Numerous commentators have commented on the dysfunction between the education of physicians and societal needs, not merely in terms of primary care and specialty distribution. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) has made recommendations, as have other groups. Major criticisms from my perspective include the following: The mixed missions of the institution and heavy emphasis on research and specialty patient care activities with the undergraduate student 1 iterally a byproduct of faculty effort. The number of \"community medical schools\" with a primary emphasis on undergraduate education and primary care remains a minority among the institutions, and some of these are attempting to emulate the more traditional model. Faculty role models that run counter to the model of community physicians. Academic rewards are based on research accomplishments and clinical specialization. General medicine, general pediatrics, and family medicine remain the stepchildren of academic medicine. The tenure, salary and other reward structures must change. 71 The curriculum, while discussion may be appropriate to another forum, is criticized for rote learning rather than problem solving, lack of emphasis on humanities and behavioral science, technology oriented but with no technology assessment and failure to use computerized analysis and clinical data banks, short on primary care and geriatrics. Training sites which are focused in inhospital settings and tertiary care settings with emphasis on technology and subspecialties. The financing problem is key here. Too much reliance on residents for the teaching of undergraduate students. Steady lengthening of residency programs. While I am not an expert in this area, my impression is that a new Flexner-type study of the whole continuum of medical education is long overdue. Costs of Education While the costs of M.D. education cannot be easily disaggregated from research and patient care, a number of studies have analyzed data and made estimates of these costs. There are striking cost differences amon~ institu\u00ad tions for the \"education functions,\" without any indication of differences in the quality of education. Two factors appear to influence costs, undoubtedly there are others. The first is class size. Schools under 100 students per class tend to have hiqher education costs, costs decline between 100-150 students, and decline further from 150-200. If enrollment cuts continue and accelerate, unit costs will rise, unless schools consolidate. The second 72 factor is an educational faculty equivalent to student ratio. The higher the faculty to student ratio, the higher the cost. Which leads me to the issue of the exponential increase in faculty and the trend in faculty salaries. Full-time faculty as reported in the most recent education issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) shows a decline in total enrollment of almost 1 ,000 medical students between 1985 and 1987, with an increase in full-time faculty of 5,000. Full-time faculty now exceeds the number of medical students. I am not naive enough to assume that the majority of time is devoted to the M.D. student. It is clear that a minority of time is, in fact, probably the smallest proportion of faculty time. However, this steady and increasing faculty size raises numerous questions as to efficiency and cost effectiveness of the education. The schools must begin to pay attention to these issues. Faculty salaries have also been rising steadily. Salaries and fringe benefits in many cases now make faculty positions as competitive, if not more so, than conmunity practice in many areas. The whole issue of practice plan organization and dispersal of funds needs to be reviewed in terms of institutional goals. Regarding the costs of graduate medical education, an even more difficult subject, numerous studies have attempted to grapple with the issue. It is clear from most of the studies that a very large proportion of residents' time is spent in, or contributes to, patient care. In addition, time is spent teaching undergraduate medical students, more junior residents. Who benefits from graduate medical education? 73 Patients, particularly indigent patients, who may receive care they might otherwise not receive; The hospital which can maintain 24-hour backup for sophisticated services, provide outpatient and emergency services, and which perceives the advantages of graduate medical education in terms of quality of care; The teaching physician who has coverage for his/her patients and, sad to say, frequently bills full fees for services provided pre\u00ad dominantly by the resident. Faculty also receive payment for supervision. The double payment problem is still with us. The medical school, which gets free junior faculty for instruction of third-and fourth-year students; and much of its support for clinical education through faculty salary support; The resident who receives specialty training enhancing future earnings potential and now also receives a living wage. Financing of Graduate Medical Educa.tion As you are aware, the financing of graduate medical education is mainly through third-party payments for patient care that is hospital based. Until about 1967, shortly after the advent of Medicare and Medicaid, resident salaries were small stipends, and a large proportion of faculty were volun\u00ad teer faculty. The initial decision of Medicare (and hence Medicaid) to pay 74 resident salaries and fringe benefits, and for supervision of faculty under Part A and to allow teaching physicians to bill for personal and identifiable servi res under Part B, changed the dyncrnics of support for both graduate and undergraduate medical education. As you all are aware, graduate medical education has grown in size and in length. Resident salaries rose rapidly until the early 1980s, and patient care funds to support the enterprise have grown rapidly. Recent Medicare changes will slow the growth. Medicaid, now separated from Medicare in many states, no longer pays for graduate medical education in the same manner as Medicare. In addition, competitive pressures and discounting threaten the flow of funds from private third parties. Studies of the costs of graduate medical education and the cost differences between teaching and non-teaching hospitals are inconclusive as to the burden versus benefits of graduate medical education. The Anderson La~e study for CoTI111onwealth, for exam~'~, shows that the difference in costs between non-teaching and major teaching hospitals is only in part attributable to graduate medical education and includes such items as severity, ambulatory care, patient mix, higher wage levels. Most studies have focused on hospital studies and do not include a tracing of physician and other costs of care. In discussing graduate medical education specialty distribution, other distributional issues and appropriateness of education, the hospital orientation and the financing of graduate medical education become problematic. Hospitals are treating more critically ill patients. Primary care physicians 75 are regarded as the core physicians to serve the majority of future patient care needs. Outpatient training in community practice, HMOs, experience with nursing home patients in long-term care, care of the elderly, the chronically ill is critical to the training of appropriate future physicians. The current financing methods are a major impediment to the development and maintenance of appropriate training sites and opportunities as well as to increasing the proportion of physicians trained in primary care. Furthennore, current financing through hospital payment places heavier financial burdens on certain regions of the country with some regions subsidizing the training of physicians for other regions. This is due to a historic anomaly of where medical schools and teaching hospitals developed and the shifting of the population in recent years to the sun belt, leaving the rust belt and east coast with an even more disproportionate graduate medical education bJrden. My suggestion to the Council is that they consider a number of alternatives to the current financing system, some of which are not mutually exclusive. These include: The changes in Medicare payment suggested earlier; A revenue tax on all third-party financing including self-insured plans, Medicare and Medicaid, placed in a pooled fund to underwrite all sites of training; Contribution by the medical schools of 10 -15 percent of resident salaries where residents teach undergraduate students; The development of the IOM recommended unified plan for the support of residents and faculty (modified Mayo plan); 76 Cost-based hospital reimbursement for both faculty and residents and no faculty billing for teaching patients in certain hospitals with large indigent loads; Tuition charges for residents in subspecialty training. Patient care funds should continue to support the proportion of activities that actually provide patient care. It is the distribution Of these funds that require change. Graduate Medical Education and Indigent Care A number of studies have shown that teaching hospitals as a class provide more uncompensated care than non-teaching hospitals. However, as Congress has recognized in establishing disproportionate share payments, only a subset of teaching hospitals provide large amounts of uncompensated care, mainly public general hospitals and certain inner city and state university hospitals. There is a long-standing symbiosis between graduate medical education and indigent care. I need not remind this audience of the linkages between medical schools, undergraduate anp graduate programs and hospitals, such as Parkland, Grady, Charity, L. A. County system, N. Y. Health and Hospitals Corporation hospitals, etc., that serve a high proportion of indigents. While in the best of all worlds, indigent care would disappear and everyone would have basic coverage dnd graduate medical education could be separated as an issue, this is not the case. I made a rough calculation from GOTH data by ownership of hospital. Approximately half of these GOTH residencies are located in public hospitals with 18 percent in under 40 county and municipal hospitals, 19 percent in approximately 40 state university 77 hospitals, and approximately 13 percent in Federal hospitals. Approximately 150 public GOTH institutions support half the residencies, in contrast to 250 private institutions that support the other half. Great care must be exercised when shifting the source of payment and sites of training for graduate medical education so that reductions are not made in the contribution of graduate medical education to indigent care. In the ideal world, each function would stand on its own with appropriate funding. We don't have an ideal world. Disproportionate share Medicare payments should continue. Medicare/Medicaid should continue to support Part A graduate medical education payments for at least the patient care time of house staff. 78 Appendix I Data Issues and Problems Federal data collection support has declined over the last several years. In health personnel data, for a variety of reasons the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has not collected original data; rather it has relied on professional associations for these data. The data that are important for policy considerations of the Council's charges are widely scattered as to source and are frequently incomplete or conflicting. Incomplete data include: Practice patterns of physicians and productivity. AMA surveys provide some data but not adequate for productivity analysis. Graduate medical education and teaching hospitals. While there are some detailed data for the GOTH hospitals, similar detail does not exist for the 600-800 non-GOTH teaching hospitals. There are inadequate data on out-of-hospital training programs. Conflicting data: Residency counts vary among GOTH, the Directory of Residency Training and the Medicare cost reports. The categorization of teaching hospitals varies. In the Wisconsin study, five hnspitals reported as teaching hospitals by one source or another, did not have approved ACGME or AOA programs. \u00b7Lack of a Clearinghouse Anyone wishing to conduct health manpower research must rely on multiple data sources, including AMA, AOA, NIRMP, Medicare Cost Reports, GOTH, 79 Bureau of Health Professions, etc. Many of these data are proprietary presenting some access problems. More important because the data are collected by many different sources and much of the data are pro\u00ad prietary, the quality of the data and sometimes the methodology of collection are uncertain. There is no central clearinghouse. 80 GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION: A LOST CAUSE OR A HOPE FOR THE FUTURE? (A RATIONALE FOR LINKING FEDERAL FUNDING TO EDUCATIONAL POLICY) Martha s. Gerrity, M.D. November 19,1987 I am here today, not as a representative from an organization, but as a physician actively involved in the education of residents and medical students. Even in my short career as a physician, and shorter career as an educator of physicians, I have become concerned by disturbing trends in physicians, their attitudes towards patients and medical education. I hope to impress upon you this same concern and caring. In addition, I will offer you ideas for approaching these problems -ideas of hope that we will refocus our attention on quality and what that truly means in medical education and health care. My task today will be accomplished in 3 steps. First, I will provide you with my \"grassroots\" perspective of the trends in patient-physician relationships and graduate medical education. Second, I will outline a rationale for continuing federal funding of graduate medical education, but within a framework that will 1) link policy to financing and 2) facilitate change in the medical education system. Finally, I will offer specific suggestions for a broad-based review of the structure and content of medical education. 81 \"GRASSROOTS\" PERSPECTIVE What do I see from my \"grassroots\" perspective? I see an advesarial tone developing between patients and physicians. Just 2 weeks ago, I looked at a local free paper and found this article, \"Does Your Doctor Dislike You?\" \"Many physicians dislike patients who won't comply with their instructions or who ask too many questions.' And many dislike treating obesity, alcoholism, low back pain and inoperable cancer.\" More and more, I see in the lay and medical press complaints that physicians do not listen, communicate clearly, understand or even spend enough time with their patients. This is not surprising from my viewpoint! Our current health care system has few incentives (except dedication) and many disincentives (especially financial) to do these activities. How can I teach these caring behaviors to residents when I know there are few incentives for me to do them in my own practice? Added upon this is a second layer of disincentives from the academic system. I am hired, salaried and rewarded for my patient care income and 82 research output. Oh yes, I am also supposed to teach. But, I will not be trained to teach or helped to improve or even be rewarded for the extra hours I work because I want to do a better job teaching. Frankly, I am amazed that attending physicians make any attempt to teach. To go beyond teaching facts and to teach humanism and caring takes even .more time -time to model behaviors, to observe resident-patient interactions and then to skillfully give feedback. What distresses me even more is the growing intensity of negative emotions among residents -anger, frustration, and a sense of having no control over anything. These emotions spill over into patient care. Patients not only become diseases but receive derogatory labels. Residents get \"hit\" or \"hurt\" when a patient is admitted to their ward. Some of the first year residents at one of our most prestigious medical centers have taken to saying, \"I am stool. Stool doesn't question.\" Something is terribly wrong with a system that produces these emotions and behaviors in intelligent individuals who went to medical school because they \"liked working with people.\" Many have called for changes in medical education for these and other reasons, but our system is recalcitrant. It \u00b7is recalcitrant because it is fragmented. There are approximately 115 university hospitals and 900 non\u00ad university hopitals receiving Medicare funds for medical 83 education. Among these one thousand hospitals, there is wide variation in resources, needs and institutional traditions. More importantly, medical education is recalcitrant because the institutions, and individuals within the institutions, work competitively and not collaboratively. I am not saying that competition at any level is bad. I am saying competition at our current level produces absurdities such as arguments over who found the AIDS virus first or falsification of research data. A RATIONALE FOR FEDERAL FUNDING OF GME We have just advanced to my second step -outlining a rationale for federal financing of graduate medical education. I will begin by restating the first of 5 ~oints in my rationale. Medical education is a fragmented, internally competitive system recalcitrant to change without an external framework and a lever. Second, the education of physicians, along with health care, is a collective or common good. A collective good is a good whose provision or consumption is shared by the members of the community. The Council on Graduate Medical Education's first principle states, \"the primary concern of the Council must be the health of the American people. There must be assured access for all to quality health care.\" If we accept this principle, that health care is not only a private good but also a collective good for the 84 American people, then we must view medical education as a collective good. Physicians play a pivotal role in health care delivery, and for many Americans they are still viewed as authorities both locally and nationally. Therefore, we must assure that they are trained adequately and have the nation's health care interests in mind. Third, Medicaid, provider liscensure and health planning under P.L. 93-641 taught us an important lesson. These programs failed to acheive their goals because their funding was not linked to the responsibility for their administration and regulation. One level of government (the federal level) funded these programs while another level (the states) attempted to administer and regulate them. The results were dismal primarily because those who regulate the program have no financial incentives to make it work. (I refer you to the article by Bruce Vladek for the details about these programs and their failures.) Fourth, the federal government is our best lever for implementing national policy. The old adage, \"he who pays the piper calls the tunes,\" can be applied here. In the United States, the only payer with a nation-wide perspective and the mandate of the American people is the federal government. Fifth, for the relatively small cost of financing GME, estimated to be 1-2% of total health care costs in the United States, we can create a framework to make nation-wide 85 changes in medical education. These changes may prove to be the solutions for our most serious health care problems. For example, incentives could be created for residency programs to staff indigent care facilities as part of an ambulatory care requirement. In summary, my five point rationale for the federal funding of GME is 1. Medical education is a fragmented, internally competitive system recalcitrant to change. 2. Medical education is a collective good whose provision and consumption is shared by the members of our community, the United States. 3. A framework that funds at one level but places the responsibility for administrating and regulating a program at another level will fail. 4. Our only system for implementing national policy and making nation-wide change is the federal government. 5. For a relatively small cost, compared to the total cost of health care in the U. S., we clay find a key that will unlock solutions to the larger, more expensive problems facing our health care system. I suggest we move towards a federal framework in the following manner. 86 First, calculate the amount of money currently given to each teaching hospital -include Medicare's direct and indirect payments for medical education. Second, maintain this level of funding for 2-3 years, but award it to each institution as a grant earmarked for medical education. Third, require every institution, each year, to account for how it spent the money. This accounting process will begin to disentangle \"teaching costs\" from patient care costs. Fourth, go back to those who do the teaching and the learning and ask them, \"do these teaching costs make sense, and if not, why not?\" Fifth, during this 2-3 year \"phase in\" period implement the broad-based review of medical education, as suggested by the Subcommittee on Graduate Medical Education Programs and Financing. Sixth, now use this framework to set specific criteria for receiving a grant. Base the criteria on the recommendations from your review of medical education, the accounting information gathered from teaching hospitals and national health manpower needs. Needless to say, this framework will not be exactly what we want the first time around. It should evolve and improve as we learn; therefore, mechanisms for its evaluation and revision should be built in at several stages. 87 SUGGESTIONS FOR THE BROAD-BASED REVIEW OF MEDICAL EDUCATION I have completed the first two steps of my task today. The final step will be 3 brief suggestions for the recommended, broad-based review of the structure and content of medical education. My first suggestion -Examine the traditions, structure and financing of academic medical centers. It is within this structure that medical education resides. Second -Approach the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and ask them to use the National Meeting of the Clinical Scholars Program as a \"think tank\" for addressing the problems of medical education. This would supplement your review by giving you access to over 50 physicians selected for their innovative thinking and their desire to bring knowledge and skills from non-biomedical fields into the medical care arena. Finally -Include people who are developing new methods for education or new ways of looking at health care. Call upon people like David Sackett, Dan Beauchamp, Kelley Skeff, Donald Schon, Howard Barrows and Alan Detskey. In conclusion, I shared with you my perspective of medical education, outlined a 5 point rationale for federal funding of GME and offered 3 ideas for a broad-based review 88 of medical education. Dr. Samuel Martin, III, in a recent editorial, urges us to lay down our arms and work collaboratively to shape the future and direct trends in our health care system. I can think of no better place to start than with medical education. 89 References 1.

Fallon, President of the Association of Professors of Medicine. The membership of the Association consists of the chairpersons of the 127 University Departments of Internal Medicine in the United States. The mission of the APM is to enhance the education of physicians in Internal Medicine, related specialties, and in biomedical research. The APM is the current host of the Federated Council on Internal Medicine. Participating societies in the Federated Council include the American College of Physicians, the American Society for Internal Medicine, the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine, the American Board of Internal Medicine, and the Association of Professors of Medicine. Each of these societies is deeply concerned with the appropriate supply of internists and with the level and quality of graduate medical edu.cation in the specialty. Recently, the Federated Council sponsored a preliminary reassessment of manpower requirements in Internal Medicine. Time constraints required that the review be based on previous data, however major new factors affecting physician demand were considered in the analysis. The latter have significant impact on earlier projections. The final report from this study should be available soon and copies will be submitted to the Council at that time. In addition, the APM and other organizations in the Federated Council will sponsor an extensive reappraisal of the curriculum for residency training in Internal Medicine. The Professors of Medicine believe that both of these efforts will enhance the quality and efficiency of graduate medical education in Internal Medicine. Profound changes in health care delivery in the United States, especially in the field of Internal Medicine, require an extensive reassessment of manpower needs. For Internal Medicine major factors in the reassessment should include: 1. The changing clinical demands in the practice of Internal Medicine. Technological advances in areas such as cardiology and gastroenterology have resulted in new procedures; for example, angioplasty and colonoscopic polypectomy, which have both decreased the need for surgical intervention and increased the demand for technically skilled internists. Simultaneously, the shift of clinical practice from hospital to ambulatory facility has accelerated demands for general internists and those specialists involved with ambulatory care. Managed health care systems require physicians skilled in preventive medicine and patient counseling as well as general adult medical care. NORMAN G. LEVINSKY, M.D. Prnsidenl\u00b7E/ecr OepMtment of Medicine Boston Universily School of Slreel Bouhward Kansas City, Kansas 66103 (913) 586-6001 WILLIAM N.

FERRIS, M.D. Councilor Deparlment or Medicine UniversUy o( Minnesota Medical School 420 011laware Street. S E Mmnm1pohs. Minnesota 55455 The increasing age of the American population has raised requirements for physician services in virtually all aspects of Internal Medicine. Similarly, the advent of AIDS has had a substantial impact on general internists and subspecialists in infectious diseases and oncology, in those areas where the disease is commonplace. Increased demand is predicted if the disease spreads nationally. 3. Changing lifestyle expectation of young physicians will affect the productivity of internists. Most surveys suggest that medical students, housestaff, and young . physicians expect more leisure time to devote to family, \u00b7cultural or athletic activities than in the past. Assessment of manpower needs based on assumptions of more than a sixty hour work week may be invalid. About one-third of residents in Internal Medicine now are women and the trend is upward. Estimates indicate that women devote JO -40 percent fewer lifetime hours to the practice of medicine than men. 4. As many as 30 percent of Americans may have inadequate medical insurance. Often the uninsured do not receive regular medical care except in times of crisis and at the end stage of their disease. If provision of medical care to less fortunate Americans becomes national policy, the demand for general and specialty Internal Medicine services would increase. 5. Each of the preceding factors has tended to enhance the demand for internist services. However, there is evidence that the supply may be decreasing. The interest of U.S. medical students in careers in Internal Medicine declined last year. There is some evidence for a decrease in quality as well. Last year, 350 fewer U.S. medical graduates entered categorical training programs in Internal Medicine. The number of USMG's in these programs fell to 64 percent, an all time low. Historically, over 25 percent of all residents in training in the United States complete programs in Internal Medicine. This is appropriate since internists provide the majority of general and specialized care to adults of all ages. Thus a trend away from Internal Medicine in favor of more highly technical and subspecialty-oriented disciplines runs counter to most assessments of health care needs in this country. The Association of Professors of Medicine concludes that a significant shortfall in highly qualified internists could be manifest in the future. We believe that the quality of the American health care system depends upon a continued supply of well trained internists and subspecialists. Efforts to improve the attractiveness of Internal Medicine by changes in training programs and in practice are underway. The Association of Professors of Medicine wishes to make several specific recommendations to the Council. These include: 1. Establishment of a permanent mechanism to assess graduate medical education requirements in the U.S. The effort should be adequately funded to conduct extensive and accurate assessments of current national physician manpower needs and to project future needs based on the impact of recent changes in health care requirements. 92 2. Support for graduate medical education should be fiscally sound, and all private and public parties should participate. All U.S. medical graduates should expect access to adequately financed .graduate medical education. This commitment is essential if we are to attract an increased number of talented, poor, and minority students into medical careers. Incentives could be established to encourage young physicians into fields such as General Internal Medicine and Geria tries where shortages seem likely. 3. . The Association of Professors of Medicine does not favor continued financial support for the graduate medical education of all interested foreign medical graduates. A select number of such trainees who plan to return to their native land should be supported. However, the widespread use of foreign medical graduate trainees as low cost substitutes for experienced physicians and paramedical personnel cannot be condoned. 93 Supplement to Testimony of Association of Professors of Medicine to Council on Graduate Medical Education November 19, 1987 In addition to these specific recommendations, the Association of Professors of Medicine would like to comment on three aspects of the draft proposals currently before the Council on Graduate Medical Education. !. The Association of Professors of Medicine generally support the conclusions and recommendations of the subcommittee on physician manpower. However, we do not believe there is sufficient data to indicate with certainty that an aggregate oversupply of physicians in the United States will occur in the foreseeable future. It seems prudent to ~ecommend that earlier projections suggesting an aggregate oversupply require careful reassessment at this time. On page two of the physician manpower draft, it is stated that there is an undersupply of physicians in family practice and an adequate supply of physicians in general internal medicine. The boundaries of the practice of family medicine and general internal medicine are rapidly merging because of the inability of family physicians in many areas to practice minor surgery, obstetrics and neonatology. The major differences between family physicians and general internists at present are related to educational curriculum and an emphasis on pediatrics in family medicine programs. It is anticipated that current practice realities will lead to changes in the curriculum for both general internal medicine and family medicine in the near future. We recommend the following statement on this topic. \"Current information suggests that there may be an undersupply of physicians providing general adult medical care in the fields of Family Medicine and Internal Medicine.\" 2. The subcommittee on financing graduate medical education criticizes efforts to increase the length of residency training. Training requirements are determined by the independent specialty boards in response to perceived educational needs for physicians in current. practice. Residency Review Committees must concur and determine individual curriculum requirements. Finally, approval by the ACGME is necessary. This multi-faceted mechanism should ensure prudent adjustment of time requirements and has worked well in most fields. Recently, the American Board of Internal Medicine has proposed an extension of cardiology training based on the dramatic increase in procedural and technical skills expected of modern cardiologists. The increase in residency training is justified by a desire to ensure excellence in board certified cardiologists. Issues relating to manpower supply or cost should not receive priority in such decisions. 3. The recommendations of the subcommittee on foreign medical graduates support the concept of training foreign graduates planning return to their native lands. The Association of Professors of Medicine agrees with this position but does not believe that graduate medical education in the United States has an obligation to train all qualified foreign-born medical graduates who may wish to enter the United States to practice. There is no acute overall shortage of physicians to justify this policy. Moreover, other nations do not provide unlimited access to practice by foreign physicians. 94 U. S. graduates of foreign medical schools should undergo rigorous examination similar to those of U.S. medical schools before entering graduate medical education in the U.S. The Association of Professors of Medicine agrees with the subcommittee that abrupt changes in the current system are undesirable. Furthermore, alternative means of provision of medical services to the medically indigent must be developed in hospitals that depend on foreign medical graduate trainees for these services. 95 Pruldfll l I I I i ' ' I I I I A PD IM ~~~~~~~0 o~~ctors In Internal Medicine 655 Fifteenth Street, N.W., Suite 425, Washington, \u00b7D.C. 20005 (202) 393-1654 Testimony by Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine before COGME, November 19, 1987 I am Dr. Eleanor Wallace, President of the Association of Program Directors in Internal Medicine, a 10 year old organization representing 95% of the more than 440 residency programs in internal medicine. Those 440 programs are extraordinarily diver\u00b7se. They range from large tertiary care university and university affiliated programs to small community hospitals. Some serve large indigent populations. Some are highly FMG dependent. They a.re both urban and rural. Both the societal needs served and the training emphasis in our constituent programs vary markedly according to their perceived missions, size and geographical location. APDIM came into being after the major thrusts of the 1950's and 60's to program expansion and subspecialization had occurred. Reviewing the twice yearly programs which we have offered our membership, all the problems with which we are struggling today have been identified and presented for discussion over these last years. We have recognized for some time that changes in our programs were needed to deal with a growing mismatch between the inpatient experience and the reality of internal medicine practice. APDIM has strived to offer its membership examples of programs which have successfully incorporated those elements which we have labelled as \"primary care/ambulatory training\" focused. The diverse nature of our training programs is an obstacle to simple solutions. What could be done in small well supported programs, or with Federal Grants in large academic medical centers, could not be generalized to the bulk of internal medicine residencies. 97 Programs had become dependent on residents for service. Inpatient demands, in many sites, had become increasingly acute and the resources (sites, faculty and funding) needed to develop educationally valid ambulatory settings did not exist. Federal and third party GME funding mitigated against shifting trainees ! into ambulatory sites. Cost containment efforts deterred hospital administrators from funding alternate health care deliverers to free up residents. APDIM recognized the need for a data base which would tell us more precisely what our training programs were doing, so that the scope of needed change could be determined. In the course of such a study it was hoped that programs which had developed innovative approaches would be identified. In 1985 APDIM undertook a survey of its training programs to develop such a data base. 317 of 442 programs responded. With support from HRSA, the survey was extensively analyzed with particular emphasis on aspects relevant to ambulatory/primary care training. Sites for such training, time spent, ~upervision and funding were explored. The presence in standard internal medicine residencies of the components of primary care training, as defined in the literature or by the title VII grant requirements, were evaluated. The impact of a coexisting primary care track on the contents of the standard track were examined. The completed study has been forwarded to Dr. Clare, the project director for HRSA and will I assume, be made available to you in full. The results can be readily summarized and high\u00ad light the extent of change which would be needed to move training into a more primary care/ambulatory oriented training mode: 1) the majority of residents in internal medicine training are receiving inpatient, subspecialty focused training 2) ambulatory training remains, for the majority, a one-half day a week experience in hospital clinics 3) relatively few programs offer an array of primary care related rotations (psychosocial skills, office ENT, orthopedics, preventive medicine, etc) and fewer residents select these options over the standard subspecialty rotations 98 4) only about one half of programs state that they have formal guidelines for ambulatory training for residents in the standard track 5) evaluation of residents in ambulatory settings has for the most part not yet focused on primary care skills 6) Funding for ambulatory experiences, particularly those outside of the hospital, is scanty and unsatisfactory. The survey revealed a small use of managed care systems for teaching (40 programs utilized an HMO for a small number of their trainees). A larger number used private offices; there were sizeable geographical differences in such usage. The presence of a primary care track in the same institution did not appear to influence the behavior of residents in the standard track with regard to choice of electives (primary care versus medical subspecialties) or career choice after completion of training. This probably reflects the location of most of the primary care tracks in large academic medical centers, with self-selection of residents into these options at the onset of their training and little crossover. As part of FCIM, (the Federated Council for Internal Medicine) we are looking at the need for change ln residency training. We are not certain that the manpower estimates have yet determined the future needs for general internists and subspecialists appropriately. We do believe however that it is time to_ r~_structure internal medicine residencies. The decision as to how much such training should be shifted to primary care emphasis should be made thoughtfully and by a consensus of program directors, of those representing internists in practice, and of the accrediting bodies. The availability of appropriate outpatient sites and supervision in those sites needs to be determined and may serve as a limiting factor. Development of flexible curricula and guidelines for training must be part of this process of transformation so that internal medicine training can meet diverse needs to provide society with generalists and subspecialists. 99 Funding for these changes must address not only the needs at ambulatory sites but the issue of inpatient care. Movement of residents off the hospital floors for increasing amounts of training cannot be done without a clear policy about who will care for their inpatients. This problem will be most acute in city, county and VA hospitals where service to the indigent and education are inextricably linked. Even in the voluntary sector, it is likely that other health care providers will be needed as teaching services lose housestaff. APDIM agrees that changes in internal medicine residency must be made. These must be' done in a careful, organized approach with attention to content, resources, a plan for funding and a timetable for change which does not jeopardize a system which has served medicine well. The internist as generalist and as subspecialist has, will and should continue to be the basis for enlightened medical care delivery in this country. Our most concrete suggestions are that we need: 1. better data on need for primary care internists and subspecialists 2. better data on availability of resources needed to transform training as needed (training sites and supervisory faculty) 3. establishment of the cost of moving training into ambulatory sites, of providing alternate health care deliverers for inpatients, and of providing the faculty teaching and supervision necessary for ambulatory teaching 4. a source for such funding 5. establishment and funding of a task force for redesigning guidelines and curriculum for internal medicine residency training -and- 6. a timetable for evaluation of all of the above to be followed by a program for implementation. 100 A NEW METHOD OF FINANCING GME WHICH ELIMINATES COST SHI_'TING The Association of Hospital Medical Education (AHME) was founded in 1956 as a national, non-profit professional organization for the purpose of improving health care through medical education. AHME has approximately 270 community teaching hospitals as institutional members and approximately 550 individual members representing those institutions. AHME serves as a forum for the exchange of ideas and positions on national policy concerning the problems of graduate and continuing medical education in community hospitals. It is an active and working organization holding regular national and regional meetings, seminars and workshops regarding all aspects of medical education. Since the advent of Medicare cost reporting in 1967 and the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (T.E.F.R.A.) in 1982, graduate medical education reimbursement has been divided into three parts. The first part has been the direct expense of graduate medical education which is limited to the stipends and/or salaries of the residents in training. The second part is the indirect expense of medical education that is relative to faculty salaries, depreciation, dietary expense, employee benefit expense, secretarial costs, administrative and general expenses, etc. The third part was the indirect medical education adjustment 101 \"A New Method of Financing GME\" November 19, 1987 Page 2 introduced by T.E.F.R.A. in 1982 but became a reality.under the Prospective Payment System (P.P.S.). The indirect medical education adjustment was instituted by PPS to adequately reimburse teaching hospitals versus non-teaching hospitals for the severity of illness which is higher in teaching hospitals. My discussion will reflect primarily on the indirect expense of graduate medical education which, as stated above, reflects overhead expense. Direct and indirect expenses are a pass through under the Medicare reimbursement program and not an expense which is paid within the Diagnostic Related Group (D.R.G.) payment. Cost shifting has been a means by which hospitals have made the best use of third party reimbursement funds since the advent of Medicare in 1967. Since the introduction of the pass through by / P.P.S. for graduate medical education direct and indirect expenses, cost shifting has been the byword especially for the indirect expense portion of graduate medical education costs. In the Arthur Young Study, there is clear evidence that the cost of a resident in different institutions has a dramatic range. In southeastern Michigan, for example, a study of the Medicare cost 102 \"A New Method of Financing GME\" November 19, 1987 Page 3 reports reflects a cost range of $44,000 per resident to as high as $116,000 per resident. The difference in that cost is \u00b7: primarily reflected in the indirect expense or overhead portion. It varies from institution to institution because the indirect expense is determined by a step-down formula which develops a ratio between the total cost of a particular expense and the cost of the direct expense of medical education. Therefore, if a hospital's dietary expense is very expensive or if the depreciation costs are high, it is reflected in the indirect expense of the step-down formula. It is my contention that the indirect expense step down formula provides a cost-shifting mechanism which can be avoided by developing a fixed percentage of cost to be added to the direct expense of salaries/stipends to reflect a more equitable manner of the financing of graduate medical education. For example, if a resident's salary in southeastern Michigan is $25,000, and a fixed percentage of 150% is utilized as the indirect expense, then the total reimbursement would be $62,500, [ $25,000 (resident stipend) plus $37,500 (indirect expense determined by the 150% fixed percentage of the resident stipend) ]. Using this formula would then allow for regional salary or stipend considerations and 103 \"A New Method of Financing GME\" November 19, 1987 Page 4 yet still provide a base for the indirect expense which would be fixed at 150%. The increase of costs relative to graduate medical education can be addressed by using the Consumer Pri~e Index (C.P.I.) as a limitation on cost increases. However, within the rules and regulations, .an increase over and above the CPI would not be allowed unless a formal waiver was sought. The formal waiver would permit an increase in costs over the CPI. The rules and regulations regarding a formal waiver would spell out the conditions that would permit the filing of a waiver request. (An example of an approved waiver might be the inclusion of malpractice costs for the house staff which may cause a rise in graduate medical education costs well above the CPI. Further, an increase in graduate medical education costs over the CPI would not be denied one year and then included in the base the second year. The base established by the institution's graduate medical education program expenses of Fiscal 1987 would be the base carried forward and adjusted only by the CPI The average cost per resident should not vary dramatically, even in the large and small teaching hospitals/institutions. The Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) has general requirements for hospitals/institutions providing graduate 104 \"A New Method of Financing GME\" November 19, 1987 Page 5 medical education. The 23 Residency Review Committees of ACGME have special requirements for each specialty. Although these criteria are the same for all programs, the Arthur Young study indicates a dramatic difference in cost for residents. The reason for this difference is in the indirect costs/overhead. The step down formula accounts for this variability. It encourages cost shifting that will improve reimbursement. A fixed percentage for indirect expense would be equitable for all institutions and could eliminate the temptation to shift costs. The fixed percentage concept proposed recognizes that the current method of computing indirect expense utilizes a step-down formula. Further, it also recognizes that direct expenses include costs other than resident stipends. The proposed concept of a fixed percentage would eliminate all other costs other than the resident stipend. The anticipated rules and regulations to be written by the Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration (HFCA), for the Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act (COBRA) of 1985 (PUB.L. 99-272) may alter the method of determining indirect expenses. However, the proposed fixed percentage concept of 150% times the resident stipend will significantly simplify the process and eliminate cost shifting 10 5 \"A New Method of Financing GME\" November 19, 1987 Page 6 which has artificially increased the cost of graduate medical education. THE SOLUTION TO STOP COST SHIFTING IS TO INITIATE A FIXED PERCENTAGE FOR THE INDIRECT EXPENSE. l:A:fgmel 106 INTRODUCTION Kr. Chairman, I am Alexander H. Williams, senior vice-president of the American Hospital Association. I am here today before the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGKE) to represent the Association and its 5400 hospital and over 40,000 individual members. It is my intention to provide specific conunents on the preliminary reconunendations reached by the Council, but before that I would like to make a few introductory remarks. The issues surrounding graduate medical education are far reaching. The public policy on graduate medical education which is shaped today will have enormous impact on all health care delivery in the U.S., not just on institutions with university affiliated graduate medical education programs. You should know that in the United States currently, there are 961 hospitals with approved residency training programs which are not eligible for membership in the Council on Teaching Hospitals (COTH) of the Association of American Medical Colleges because they have less than four approved residency programs. These institutions nontheless have a deep interest and involvement in the matters under discussion and are represented by the AHA. The American Hospital Association does not consider the proliferation of foreign medical graduates as an acceptable methodology for insuring adequate medical manpower for underserved areas. Nonetheless, we recognize that many innercity teaching hospitals which provide the bulk of health services to 107 their surrounding communities are largely dependent on foreign medical graduates to provide that care. The AHA therefore urges caution in changing public policy on FMGs which might negatively affect the needed services provided by those institutions. Because graduate medical education, medical practice and the provision of medical services are closely intertwined, decisions on the financing of medical edu~ation have far reaching implications for the number and specialty distribution of physicians and patient care, particularly referral services. Decisions to change the current financing system as well as the size, duration, content and quality of medical education programs should therefore be made cautiously and incrementally. The American Hospital Association further believes that funding for graduate medical education should continue through the patient care dollar until a workable alternative can be demonstrated to adequately support residency training and its related service activities. COGME Preliminary Recommendations A. Physician Manpower In the interest of time, I will not comment on the physician manpower recommendations except to indicate our concurrence with the preliminary conclusion that there is a geographic maldistribution of physicians with too few primary care physicians in many rural and inner city areas. We 108 also endorse the recommendation that incentives to encourage physicians to locate and remain in shortage areas should be continued and strengthened. B. Foreign Medical Graduates Under special contract to the Council, the American Hospital Association is currently undertaking a study to determine the specific connection, if any, between foreign medical graduates in training programs and the provision of medical care to the indigent. Our present policy on this matter reflects our belief that there may well be a connection. We therefore believe that any restrictions instituted by Medicare for the graduate medical education of FMGs should be phased in to avoid potentially negative effects on the delivery of care. We are pleased that this is also the Council's recommendation. We also applaud the supporting recommendation that greater financial resources are needed for provision of medical care to the indigent, particularly in those states with a recognized high dependency on training programs for provision of care to the indigent. AHA agrees with the preliminary conclusion that no person, including a graduate of a U.S. medical school, has an absolute right or entitlement to a residency position. Through its involvement in activities of the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, AHA subscribes to the principle of access dictated by individual qualifications rather than 109 institutional qualifications or nationality. The American Hospital Association has been a consistent supporter of the provision of specialty training for international exchange visitors and is an early supporter and incorporator of the International Medical scholars Program. The American Hospital Association supports the addition into the ECFMG certification process of a clinical skills assessment and a test for spoken Engl,ish. Pilot programs have shown that the clinical skills assessment screens out approximately 25 percent of the foreign medical graduate~ who would otherwise be eligible for ECFMG certification. There is significant anecdotal evidence that inability to communicate in English inhibits the educational process and creates a significant patient care problem. The American Hospital Association opposes a program of formal recognition of foreign medical schools. We concur that it would be both presumptuous and unwise for the united states to attempt to provide recognition or accreditation of medical education programs outside its own domain. Furthermore, we believe that the present system of ECFMG certification is an appropriate screen of foreign medical graduates and adequately serves the purpose of protecting tho American public. C. Financing Graduate Medical Education The American Hospital Association strongly supports the first two 110 preliminary recommendations on graduate medical education financing. We concur that changes in the financing of graduate medical education should be undertaken in an evolutionary rather than precipitous manner and that payments for the direct costs of graduate medical education should be continued through existing mechanisms, utilizing current sources, conduits and recipients. We concur that there is not an immediate crisis and that immediate change is not necessary. The American Hospital Association believes that the current practice of integrating the financing of graduate medical education into the payment structure for service provision is appropriate. We further believe that extensive reliance on private practice plans as a workable alternative for the financing of graduate medical education is unrealistic, except in a few institutions. The American Hospital Association is not opposed to the exploration of alternative sources and methods of financing for graduate medical education, but believes that any new method will, perforce, be strongly reliant on multiple sources of public funding. AHA suggests the fQliowing principles for consideration by the Council in its continuing discussions on graduate medical education financing: 1. Society has an obligation to adequately fund residency training so that only well-\u00b7trained practitioners practice medicine independently. 111 2. As any other payer, Medicare should contribute its proportionate share of the costs of graduate medical education. 3. Medicare should recognizo that at least some of tho costs associated with graduate medical education cannot be identified. 4. Medicare payment policies that recognize tho costs associated with graduate mnodical education should not produce disruptive a.nd radical shifts in the distribution of rovonues among hospitals. 5. Any restrictions on payment should be sensitive to the effect these changes may have on the quality of educational programs and the ultimate competence of physicians in practice. Arbitrary .limits on funding should be avoided. Tho American Hospital Association is also pleased that the Counc.il has identified a problem of great concern to hospitals --the industry's limited voice in decisions to expand or lengthen residency training programs. AHA has initiated high level discussions with the American Medical Association, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the American Board of Medical Specialties to seek ways to redress this problem. We expect these discussions to result in the preparation by the medical specialty boards, with consultation from the AHA and AAMC, of statements concerning the financial impact of changes in the training time required for Board certification. Discussions will also continue to 112 ensure that these financial impact statements are reviewed early enough in the process to genuinely influence decisions concerning residency requirements. It is also clear to the AHA that an increasing proportion of training will have to take place in non-inpatient settings, especially in the primary care specialties, to reflect the realities of the health care environment. While there are undoubtedly barriers which inhibit the appropriate use of ambulatory care settings for both graduate and undergraduate medical education, these barriers are probably not institutional in character. That is, by and large, institutions that sponsor ambulatory settings are receptive to the use of graduates and undergraduates in those settings. There are, however, significant numbers of institutions which do not have organized ambulatory programs and rely on physicians in private practice to provide outpatient care. These institutions and/or physicians may require financial incentives and assistance to successfully establish graduate medical education programs in the ambulatory facilities and program units under their control. Because of the comp_l.~xity of this matter, the American Hospital Association supports the recommendation for demonstration projects. The American Hospital Association is on record in opposition to further cuts in the indirect cost adjustment. There is a close correlation between those institutions with the highest case-mix severity index and teaching programs. Therefore, the existing indirect payment has been ]]3 characterized as a proxy for a severity index. The treatment of the more severely ill patient involves the provision of referral services, and accordingly, large referral centers are potentially the most at risk if reductions are introduced in the indirect adjustment. The American Hospital Association believes that the numbers and types of physicians trained should be guided by the health care delivery needs of both individual facilities and the nation as a whole. Our concern is that up until now national manpower considerations have not had sufficient influence on the distribution of physicians in general or within specialties. Finally, given the charge to COGME, the American Hospital Association is puzzled by the recommendation for a major broad-based private sector review of the structure and content of undergraduate and graduate medical education. we believe that congress expects such a study from COGME with the assistance of the affected constituencies. The American Hospital Association, as the representative of 5,400 of the nation's hospitals, and an important source of data stands ready to assist the Council to continue this study through testimony, contractual agreement, or staff-to-staff consultation. .we look forward to the opportunity to work with you on these important issues in the near future. Thank you. lM TESTIMONY PREPARED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION November 19, 1987 Council members, observers and guests, I am Dr. Michael Opipari from Detroit, Michigan. I am speaking upon behalf of the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), the American Osteopathic Hospital Association (AOHA) and the Academy of Osteopathic Director's of Medical Education (AODME). This presentation speaks for all three components of the osteopathic community, medical schools, hospitals and physicians. The osteopathic profession includes 15 colleges of osteopathic medicine, 190 hospitals and 27,000 thousand physicians and students. This presentation includes a description of the profession and its education and clinical concerns as they relate to the agenda of this Council. We strongly believe that for manpower planning purposes osteopathic physicians should be considered separately and not aggregated with allopathic physicians. There are two major reasons for this assertion. First, the osteopathic medical education system pr;marily produces family physicians. This is congruent with and acknowledged to be a public health goal for the United States. Family physicians are in short supply --not over supply. We feel, .i., therefore, there is no evidence to support a conclusion that there will be an over supply of osteopathic physicians for the foreseeable future. 115 Statistics on numbers, types and distribution of osteopathic physicians as well as hospital financing concerns were presented by the AOA and AOHA to tbe Council Subcommittee's on Physician Manpower and Financing at the hearings held last March 17, 1987 and June 29, 1987. Some eighty percent of all osteopathic physicians are practicing in che areas of primary care. A second reason for separate consideration is osteopathic medical education. There is a shortage of osteopathic rotating internship (PGY-1) positions. Tho osteopathic graduating class has grown dramatically from four hundred in 1970 to sixteen hundred this year. It is essential that appropriate osteopathic postdoctoral training be accessible to each and every graduate. A funding mechanism should exist to assure that both hospital and ambulatory sites are available for this training. The shortage of slots is not limited to internship positions, but is also found in osteopathic residency training. All funding mechanisms should assure the development and support of osteopathic reside11cy programs, particularly in the area of primary care. The osteopathic medical education model has been shown to be cost-effective. We present the following data: 116 Fae t 1: Fact 2: Fae t 3: Fact 4: Average Cost Per Trainee (Intern/Resident) Per Year. -approximately $25,000 -$35,000 per year average. The major cost savings within the osteopathic model is due to use of essentially an entire volunteer faculty in the teaching hospitals. With the exception of three (3) college-owned hospitals, all other teaching hospitals are private and no faculty other than the Director of Medical Education is paid. The entire funding for the G.M.E. programs is only through the traditional pass-through mechanism (no practice plans, no grants, etc.). Osteopathic Trainees in Primary Care Residency Training Programs in 1986. 1,337 = 48% 0.0. residents in Family Practice residencies + 18% D.0. 1s enter General Practice directly after PGY-1, which is an osteopathic rotating internship training year. 66% D.0. Trainees in Primary Care (Family Practice) Total number of D.0. residents ~ 2,793 Therefore, 66% of D.O. trainees are in Primary Care programs as opposed to only 40% of allopathic trainees. Size of Osteopathic Training Hospitals, Virtually all G.M.E. training sites are private hospitals with less than 300 beds (the majority have less than 200 beds), and with a community orientation (small and rural). Average Osteopathic Trainee Salary. Osteopathic interns and residents have traditionally had a significantly reduced salary structure compared to allopathic residents. 1986 1986 Osteopathic P.G.Y. I (intern) Allopathic P.G.Y. $14,837 $23,600 This fact coupled with the non-paid G.M.E, faculty accounts for improved cost effectiveness of training an osteopathic resident. Tha ~a~k-~ differential in salary is also a reason for many osteopathic trainees selecting allopathic residencies. At the institutions wi.th which I am affiliated we have recently created a $2,400 per year pay differential increase for primary care\u00b7 residents over non primary care residents. ]) 7 Fae t 5: Fact 6: Fact 7: Sites for Ambulatory Training in the Osteopathic Programs. Virtually all a1nbulatory training experiences for osteopathic residents or interns occur in private practitioner offices (preceptor model), thus making the exposure real to community practice as opposed to medical center clinic. No trainer reimbursement occurs for the time expenditure of the training physician in spite of being slowed down by the trainee. No expense accrual thus occurs on the cost report of the ~rogram. Reasons for the Success of the Osteopathic Primary Care Model. (a) All osteopathic colleges have required general (family) practice clerkship rotations during clinical years, thus beginning exposure to the student. (b) The required osteopathic rotating internship mandates a minimum of 50% time spent in primary care experience. 3 months internal medicine 1 months general practice 1 months pediatrics 1 months obstetrics and/or gynecology (c) Effective role model practitioners: (1) The 1978 Kellogg Report identified 88.5% of D.0. 's as primary care physicians. In spite of development of subspecialty training programs, certification ~oard exams in addition to acceptance into allopathic fellowships, the family practice numbers in 1986 in the osteopathic profession remain very high at 66%. (2) The Kellogg Report indicated 39% D.0. 's practice in communities with populations below 20,000, 50% under 50,000, and only 17% in communities over 500,000. Since osteopathic training is producing the desired end product namely, a primary care (family practice) practitioner, in significant numbers, and there is an acknowledged under supply, there is little reason to consider D.O.'s in the aggregate of a physician surplus. Of equal importance is an u:;,12rstanding of the osteopathic hospital system. 118 Osteopathic Hospital Profile Osteopathic hospitals serve as the primary institutional care facilities for those patients who choose to receive their care from the 22,000 practicing osteopathic physicians nationwide. Like all hospitals, osteopathic hospitals are facing fierce competition in today's healthcare marketplace. With nearly half of our 190 institutions having less than 100 beds and 92% having less than 300 beds, the osteopathic hospital profile reflects a very special community orientation. Because of our inherently small size, our hospitals are especially vulnerable to changes in the marketplace. Since 1985, ten osteopathic hospitals have closed and two no longer retain their osteopathic identity. Of these, five were teaching hospitals. These losses are felt in communities where we provide a healthcare choice based on a distinctive medical philosophy that offers a holistic, \"hands-on\" approach. Osteopathic medicine offers an extra dimension of traditional healthcare. The Osteopathic Teaching Hospital The training of osteopathic physicians is a major concern for osteopathic hospitals. The continued funding of graduate medical education is essential to the number of training positions we can provide. Presently, all of our 129 teaching hospitals offer intern training and 70% provide residency training. Approved intern training programs within individual institutions and multi-hospital systems range from 2-86 positions. Approved residencies per hospital or system range from 1-101. The overwhelming majority of our teaching hospitals are community facilities and not academic health centers. 119 In fact, all of our community hospitals Kith 200-299 beds are i:ec1ching institutions, while 701 with 100-1G9 tJeds have teaching programs. Only three of the 15 osteopatt1ic 1ne<lical colleges CtLrrently operate teaching hospitals, giving further evidence that our programs are essentially community based. The osteopathic teaching hospital role in training general practioners and specialists begins during the osteopathic medical student1s undergraduate training. Our educational model stresses clinical exposure through clinical clerkships. This type of hands on clinical education is an essential ingredient to train the osteopathic physician. The osteopathic hospital has traditionally had primary responsibility for conduct of internships and residencies. Under the osteopathic graduate medical education model, all osteopathic physicians must enroll in a one-year rotating internship during which they receive clinical exposure in a multitude of areas. This rotating internship is required for program approval by the American Osteopathic Association (ADA) the accrediting arm of the profession, and for licensure in most states. This builds the foundation for the osteopathic physician to practice general medicine under all federal and state statutes with the exception of New Hampshire, where two years of post-graduate training is required for all physicians. Residency training, especially in the primary care specialties, plays an important role in our teaching hospitals. The osteopathic first year of residency is actually equivalent to PGY II in allopathic training programs. (While our general practice model consists of a one-year rotating internship followed by one-year residency with an optional second year (three graduate years), other specialties require from two to six years additional training. 120 There are 1,660 approved osteopathic intern positions for 1987-88, ~hile 2,020 approved residency positions exist. We expect 1,601 graduating students to seek these positions in the coming year. While these figures appear positi\u00b7ve. 281 intern positions are currently unfunded by hospitals, because of financial cohstrai!1tS and decreasing census. This places osteopathic hospitals in a jeopardy of not being able to train all incoming graduates in an osteopathic setting. We are currently trying a work out these problems within the profession, but our options are limited. Any federal or state policy initiatives that limit payment for teaching purposes will further exacerbate our problems. Other. Distinctions Between Osteopathic and Allopathic Training Programs In addition to the rotating internship which is unique to the osteopathic training model, there are other distinctions between osteopathic and allopathic training programs. Nearly all of the faculty are volunteer, (no pay, no practice plans) as are specialty college and certification board members and personnel. Instructors also carry a full patient load in addition to their training responsibilities. Besides all conventional medical procedures, students studying os~eopathic medicine are specially trained to perform osteopathic manipulative therapy (OMT). OMT is a procedure in which osteopathic physicians use their hands to diagnose and treat muscular skeletal problems when indicated. This additional procedure, with special facilities established in the hospitals for its use, enables comprehensive osteopathic care to be rendered to hospital patients. 121 Osteopathic training programs are initially approved by the AOA' ~; Committee on Postdoctoral Training - a body equivalent to the Accreditation Cot1ncil for Graduate Medical Education. The AOA Board has final approval authority. Re-approval for residency programs is granted after periodic review by specialty college surveyors. The Finan.cing of Osteopathic Teaching Hospitals The financing of osteopathic teaching hospitals comes primarily through third party reimbursement. There is essentially no grant support or other direct state or federal funding. For example, in 1987, only two federal grants were awarded to our teaching hospitals nationwide to support primary care specialty residencies (1 internal medicine, 1 pediatrics). In addition, only six general practice residencies received federal grant assistance. Therefore, private support through reimbursement by third party payers and patients themselves continue to be the only other funding sources available. Thus, additional federal cutbacks in funding would be devastating. Recent GME funding cuts have already resulted in the reduction of available internship and residency positions in some institutions. These cutbacks are felt more severely when coupled with the full implementation \u00b7of the\u00b7 national prospective rate setting system and the anticipated budget cuts recommended by the administration. This \\oJill increase the pressure on an already taxed system due to insuff.i<...icn~ ...;.vailable internship positions for the increasing number of osteopathic graduates. Other \u00a5inancing Considerations The uniqt1e profile of the osteopathic trainit1g model presents additional 122 financing considerations. If tl1e current financing system is restructured. osteopathic teaching hospitals must be able to compete equally with allopathic GME programs for available funding despite the relative lack of resources. faculty trainers, and academic base of support. We must find mechanisms to make available necessary funding for osteopathic teaching, hospital faculty development and for at least partial salary support for hospital teaching faculty and program directors. As our voluntary faculty faces increasing practice pressures and other demands, our hospitals will not be able to retain their traditional volunteer faculties. We believe our concerns are justified especially since the Congressional Budget Office recently reported to you that osteopathic teaching programs in our hospitals are more cost effective than the allopathic model. The osteopathic profession is under increasing pressure to develop and create alternative training programs in non-osteopathic community institutions. These are being administered through osteopathic medical colleges or through affiliations with other hospitals. A continuing shrinking patient base coupled with increased competition fo+ patients in community hospitals, is also resulting in less teaching opportunities. This may result in program and available position reductions especially with reduced reimbursement. 123 Issue Summation As we have shown, osteopathic hospital based teaching programs by their very nature are smaller than others. They are community hospital based and currently stre~ched to the limit in their capacity to financially support the increased demand of osteopathic graduates. \\.J'ith an ever increasing influx of osteopathic medical school graduates, the traditional osteopathic teaching hospital finds itself faced with ever mounting pressures. The pressures are broadly based. Osteopathic graduates need intern and residency slots. Their concerns are real. Meanwhile, support for training is shrinking; the osteopathic hospital system is consolidating and tightening due to the contemporary economics of health care, with the result being that an increasing number of training opportunities are outside the osteopathic hospital. We strongly believe that if we are to have a pluralistic health care system with a real choice in medical practice and philosophy of care offered, then traditional osteopathic hospital and ambulatory based programs must continue to be supported as the site of first choice for graduate medical education training. This can't be accomplished without continued financial recognition. Even the slightest reduction can drastically reduce program size resulting in another osteopathic physician being forced to seek training from outside of his or her chosen profession. The economics of health care precipitated by the Medicare prospective payment system, have led to a declining bed census and a dramatic growth in ambulatorv services provided by osteopathic hospitals. Decreased caseloads in small teaching hospitals often mean refined training experiences and always mean less federal support. 1 21, In Pennsylvania, for exainple, osteopathic hospitals are finding that 32% of their medical education costs are not reimbursed. This is leading to consideration bY some hospitals to reduce the size of tl1eir programs. In Michigan, osteopathic hospitals find themselves in a highly charged and competitive market. This has preser,ted a different problem: thE: need to significantly raise stipends to keep osteopathic graduates from training in more lucrative allopathic programs. Meanwhile, the Department of Health and Human Services is seeking a further chipping away of the base of support. Conclusion: Funding sources should continue to be available for adequate training opportunities at all levels of osteopathic medical education -the colleges, internsl1ip and residencies, and continuing education. 125 RECOMMENDATIONS 1. Alter physician reimbursement to emphasize cognitive skills over procedural skills. This will create an incentive to enter primary care training. Currently the incentive is counter productive. 2. Allow a higher reimbursement differential through direct medical education reimbursement in favor of primary care trainees to include osteopathic interns. 3. Allow bonus reimbursement to institutions with over 11X11 percent trainees in primary care, through the indirect payment adjustment. 4. Establish a definitive mechanism for reimbursement for the ambulatory training costs in community sites, with some reimbursement for the ambulatory training supervisor. Offer a mechanism and incentive for continued utilization of established community sites (osteopathic model). 5. Continue at least current mechanism and level of G.M.E. reimbursement pass through to training institutions in order to allow adequate P.G.Y. I (osteopathic internship) positions as precursors to continued primary care training. 6. Develop Council on Graduate Medical Education recommendations that consider osteopathic manpower supply both separately from the allopathic manpower supply as well as in the aggregate. 126 AARON SHIRLEY, MD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center Jackson, Mississippi Representing the National Association of Community Health centers The National Association of Community Health centers (NACHC) represents over 580 Community and Migrant Health Centers--including 1500 clinic sites and over 3,000 physicians--that provide primary care services throughout the country to the nation's six million poorest citizens, the majority of whom belong to minority popula\u00ad tions. Although some nationally-based calculations indicate a physician \"glut\" in terms of some medical specialities, and some\u00ad times of primary care disciplines in terms of geographic distribu\u00ad tion, it has been NACHC's experience that there exists a distinct under-supply of primary care physicians, especially of minority physicians, in the inner cities and poor rural communities to meet the health care needs of America's poor. I would now like to speak from my own personal experience. I have practiced medicine in Mississippi since 1960, first upon graduation from Meharry Medical College, and later upon completion of my pediatric residency in 1967 at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson. My opportunity to obtain a medical education resulted from a state loan program which had a payback provision which required practicing primary care for five years in an underserved area in Mississippi. To be frank, my original inten\u00ad tion when I first returned to the state in 1960 was to complete my obligation and then leave, given the inter-racial climate at the time. Yet I soon learned there was an overwhelming need for more black physicians in the state, as there were only 47 black physicians in a state which had a black population of about one mil\u00ad lion. It became evident that there was a high correlation between being poor and being black and being sick. It was also clear that those physicians most likely to care for poor black patients were black. I therefore made the decision to remain in Mississippi, and I undertook a pediatric residency at the University of Mississippi, the first black to do so. I became increasingly concerned with the lack of minority physicians, as I noted the high number of cases of black infants and children admitted to the hospital who came from as far away as 200 miles because there was no one to care for them in their local communitie~. Then, with the assistance of a national black medical student association, we were able to identify between 45 and 50 blacks from Mississippi who were enrolled in medical school outside the state. We also become acquainted with a com\u00ad prehensive health care facility sponsored by Tufts Medical School in the Mississippi delta. With resources from this program and the Mississippi Regional Medical Program, we brought these students back to the state for three consecutive summers to expose them to com\u00ad munities in desperate need for them to return to and practice in on completion of their medical education. Then the National Health Service corps (NHSC) was established. Since 1966, the number of federally-funded community health centers in Mississippi has increased from one to 21 such facilities today. Not coincidenta.lly, the number of black physicians in the state has increased since 1966 from 47 to about 130 today. I can safely say that no less than 90% of these additional minority primary care physicians are in the state as a direct result of the combined efforts of these various medical manpower development programs. 12 7 Of particular significance is the fact that even those minority physicians who may have left health centers upon completion of their NHSC obligations have remained in poor areas and continue to serve those most in need. Continuation of such medical manpower develop\u00ad ment is crucial to the health care of Mississippi's and America's poor and minority citizens. ]28 ONE ATWELL ROAD COOPERSTO\\VN, NE\\V YORK 13326-1394 Improved Funding of Graduate Medical Education in Rural Teaching Hospitals will Mean Better Patient Care John S. Davis, M.D., Director of Medical Education, The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital, Cooperstown, New York; Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine, Columbia University* Many rural areas remain medically underserved, despite an emerging, overall physician surplus. One way to deal with this problem is to provide a differential federal payment allocation for small rural teaching hospitals, so that they can continue to set the standard of quality medical care for rural areas. This quality stems from the academic milieu enabling recruitment of an excellent resident staff, along with attracting and retaining a faculty whose enthusiasm for teaching and research becomes tuned to rural medical problems. An enduring rural health care network is thus assured, in concert with the surrounding physician commuhity. One proven model for solving these problems is portrayed here. Its relatively small size, like most rural hospitals, Is an asset, allowing a highly personal approach to the educational process and an increased flexibility to deal with local problems. But without increased financial support, the teaching approach it exemplifies will face a limited future. The Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital, located in an Upstate NY village with a population of 2400, was organized in 1927 as a private, rural referral center with a full-time, salaried, physician staff, committed to house staff education and research as the background for patient care. In the subsequent 60 years the hospital has achieved a national reputation for its teaching and for research related especially to rural health problems. Today it is a regional, multl-~isciplinary physician group practice with 180 acute-care beds, and, in 1986, 6929 admissions, 49,507 patient days and 150, 130 outpatient visits, drawn from a nine-county surrounding area and beyond. Medicare, medicaid and all other payor classification for admitted patients were 45, 13 and 42\u00b0/o respectively. The hospital successfully operates a health maintenance organization and thus provides an important, additional teaching model. About 80 fourth-year medical students elect rotations each year from 28 elective offerings, and sought-after residency programs include internal medicine, general surgery, psychiatry, a transitional year and rotations tp Bassett from other medical centers in four additional disciplines. Nine of 18 of the physicians running the hospital's 10 community clinics are graduates of its residency programs. The staff also provides high-quality continuing education for physicians affiliated with surrounding community hospitals, along with a wide front of allied health and community education programs. The overall operation resembles, on a small-scale, an Area Health Education Center (characterized as such in 1970 by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education), with an advantage of being able to tailor objectives closely to local needs. Plans for graduate medical education at Bassett Hospital include continuation of current residency programs, expansion of medical student teaching and project more teaching In outpatient clinics, including the network of 10 community centers. However. the small size of the institution means that unit costs tend to be higher than those of larger hospitals for providing the same range and quality of services necessary for both the educational program and optimal patient care: the ratio of fixed to variable costs at Bassett is about 80/20 as opposed to larger. urban teaching hospitals at around 60/40. This pressure puts educational programs in particular economic jeopardy in relation to the finite limits for meeting overall institutional expenses. Added pressures include tightened ACGME requirements for small programs and new State regulations for house staff hours and supervision. Without adequate funding, major cutbacks in the hospital's existing and planned graduate education programs are threatened. In summary, the cited \"Bassett model\" of medical education and care helps address the problems of recruiting and retaining physicians to provide high-quality care in rural areas. It is promoted as one innovative approach among others. But unless other effective, national funding methods can be established. the best solution for supporting graduate medical education in rural teaching hospitals should be modlticatlon of the federal direct and Indirect payment formulas in line with the economic realities of smaller institutions. presented to the Public Hearing of the Council on Graduate Meaical Education (COGME} at Bethesda, MO on November 20. 1987 129 ORAL STATEMENT of the AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION to the Council on Graduate Medical Education Presented by Frank A. Riddick, Jr., M.D. RE: Graduate Medical Education, Foreign Medical Graduates and Physician Manpower Issues November 19, 1987 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Council: My name is Fran~ A. Riddick, Jr., M.D. I am a member of the AMA's Council on Medical Education, and I am also an AMA representative to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the accrediting body for United States and Canadian medical schools. I have served as Chairman of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the accrediting body for U.S. graduate medical education programs, and as Chairman of the AMA Council on Medical Education. Accompanying me is Thomas Wolff of the AMA's Department of Federal Legislation. The AMA is pleased to have the opportunity to testify before the Council on Graduate Medical Education. In the notice announcing this hearing, the Council identified questions in three areas that need to be addressed: physician manpower, foreign medical graduates, and the financing of graduate medical education. Because of limitations on time 131 for oral presentation, my remarks today focus on the financing of graduate medical education. The AMA's written statement for the hearing record addresses this subject in more detail, as well as the issues of physician manpower and foreign medical graduates. Mr. Chairman, the graduate medical education system in the United States is the benchmark against which other medical education systems are and should be judged. A key element in achieving this preeminent position has been the existence of stable funding mechanisms. Over the past year COGME has heard varying and sometimes conflicting views concerning the financing of GME. In the statements, conclusions, and suggested recommendations issued after your October s, 1987 meeting, we observe notes of caution and restraint which are commendable. We urge you to continue in this direction and develop thoughtful and reasoned recommendations concerning\u00b7 graduate medical education and its financing that will preserve the high quality of graduate medical education in this country and diminish the possibility of ill-advised or ill-informed actions by government and the private sector. The AMA has developed the following principles concerning graduate medical education and its financing and we urge that you give them careful consideration in the development of any recommendations to Congress. 1. Graduate medical education is an essential component of the education of all physicians. Because the health and well being of the American people are directly and significantly benefited by the graduate medical 132 education of physicians, societal contributions to the financing of graduate medical education are not only appropriate but are in the best interest of society. 2. In residency training programs, the education of physicians and the clinical care of patients are inextricably linked. Thus, it is unproductive to attempt to factor out, as some would seek to do, the portion of a resident's time devoted to education. 3. Patient care revenues, derived from both public and private payers, should continue to be used as the predominant source of funding graduate medical education. All public and private payers of patient care costs should contribute their proportionate share of GME expenses. A key benefit of the existing system of funding the majority of graduate medical education costs through patient care revenues is the stable financial environment that such funding has fostered. This predictable financial environment, in which teaching hospitals are assured that payment will be made for reasonable direct and indirect medical education costs, has been a major reason for the number of high quality teaching programs available. Fundipg for GME should continue to be derived from other sources, including state government funds, the Veterans Administration, federal, state and private grants, institutional gifts, and endowment income. It is important to recognize, however, that no other source of 133 funds, including faculty practice plans, is capable by its elf of adequately supporting GME. 4. In a period of severe federal fiscal constraints, first priority for Medicare funding for graduate medical education should be given to graduates of medical schools accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education or the American Osteopathic Association. If adequate federal resources are not available, it would be appropriate to eliminate Medicare support for the residency training of FMGs, both aliens and U.S. citizens. A gradual phasing out of Medicare support is essential to protect individual FMG residents already in training as well as hospitals and patients dependent on FMG residents. 5. Teaching hospitals should be reimbursed fully for their reasonable direct medical education costs, including the reasonable costs of residents salaries and fringe benefits, as well as costs relating to faculty instruction of residents. 6. The Medicare indirect medical education adjustment should be continued at an adequate level. A substantial reduction in the indirect adjustment would have a severe adverse impact on many teaching hospitals, particularly inner-city and major teaching hospitals that provide substantial amounts of uncompensated or inadequately compensated care. In our view, care of the indigent, which is entwined in the indirect medical education adjustment, must be recognized specifically and paid for by separate mechanisms. 134 7. Support for both direct and indirect medical education costs must include residents assigned to ambulatory sites that are required components of educational programs. Given the strong trend toward providing care in the outpatient setting, and the desire to increase the number of physicians entering the primary care specialties, it would be particularly inappropriate to penalize hospitals for placing residents in ambulatory care sites. 8. Individual billing by residents for their services as a means of reducing the direct costs of graduate medical education should not be fostered. Such billing could interfere with supervised education upon which program accreditation depends. 9. Direct federal financing assistance for primary care residency programs in the areas of family medicine, general internal medicine and general pediatrics, should be continued. Abrupt withdrawal of support for, these programs could\u00b7 be highly disruptive and impede the development of manpower in the primary care areas of practice. 10. Residency training should be available to every graduate of a U.S. medical school. Graduates, however, cannot be guaranteed their choice of specialty and location. 11. Residents should receive reasonable compensation in all training programs. uncompensated and under-compensated programs should be discouraged. 135 In concluding, the AMA supports the reconunendations of the Council's subconunittee that advocate the continuation of the current mechanisms of funding graduate medical education. In the final analysis, these mechanisms will remain the simplest to administer and to monitor. We urge the Council not to consider any new mechanisms for payment which will be complicated, burdensome, and costly to implement. Mr. Chairman, my conunents have stressed societal responsibility to support graduate medical education and the obligation of government and the private sector to preserve the nation's teaching hospitals. We must note, however, that the configuration and the size of the graduate medical education system must at any point in time reflect anticipated health care needs of the American people. Institutions must conduct internal examinations of the programs they sponsor, assess the need for specific programs and determine the numbers of residents in these programs. The entire graduate medical education system should provide sufficient opportunities for all U.S. medical school graduates and sufficient flexibility to allow a measure of career choice. The private sector, led by the major professional organizations, must continue to examine the graduate medical education system with urgent attention to the mechanisms by which added requirements for specialty training are reviewed and adopted. 136 The AMA commends COGME for holding this hearing and appreciates the opportunity to testify. We believe that before each Subcommittee makes its final recommendations, a public hearing should be held at which interested parties may present their views. Mr. Chairman, I will be happy to answer any questions members of the Council have. 3285p/dwc 137 STATEMENT of the AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION to the Council on Graduate Medical Education Presented by Frank A. Riddick, Jr., M.D. Re: Graduate Medical Education, Foreign Medical Graduates and Physician Manpower Issues November 19, 1987 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Council: My name is Frank A. Riddick, Jr., M.D. I am a member of the AMA's Council on Medical Education, and I am also an AMA representative to the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the accrediting body for United States and Canadian medical schools. I have served as Chairman of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the accrediting body for U.S. graduate medical education programs, and as Chairman of the AMA Council on Medical Education. Accompanying me is Thomas Wolff of the AMA's Department of Federal Legislation. The AMA is pleased to have the opportunity to testify before the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME). In the notice announcing this hearing, the Council identified questions in three areas that need to be addressed: physician manpower, foreign medical graduates, and the financing.of graduate medical education. These questions identify 138 numerous issues that need to be addressed as the Council proceeds under its ten-year charter to make recommendations concerning physician training. As you are aware, not all of the questions you have posed have clear answers today and some may require years of research to provide the data needed. We commend you for your thoughtful inquiry and will touch on all three areas in our statement. GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION (GME) The AMA believes strongly that the graduate medical education system in the United States is the benchmark against which other medical education systems are and should be judged. It is a system that encourages excellence, dedication and knowledge. A key element in achieving this preeminent position has been the existence of stable funding mechanisms. Over the past year COGME has heard varying and sometimes conflicting views concerning the financing of GME. In the statements, conclusions, and suggested recommendations issued after your October 5, 1987 meeting, we observe notes of caution and restraint which are commendable. We urge you to continue this direction and develop thoughtful and reasoned recommendations concerning graduate medical education and its financing\u00b7 that will preserve the high quality of graduate medical education in this country and diminish the possibility of ill-advised or ill-informed actions by government and the private sector. 139 The AMA has developed the following pr\"inciples concer\"ning gr\"aduate medical education and its financing.\u00b7 We Ur\"ge that you give these pr\"inciples car\"eful consider\"ation in the development of any r\"ecommendations to Congr\"ess. 1. Gr\"aduate medical education is an essential component of the education of all physicians. The education of physicians is a long and ar\"duous pr\"ocess r\"equir\"ing year\"s pr\"actical aspects of patient car\"e. The fir\"st year\"S of education in medical school focus gener\"ally on the basic medical sciences in classr\"oom and labor\"ator\"y exper\"iences. As medical education pr\"ogr\"esses, when students study clinical sciences, ther\"e is incr\"easing integr\"ation of the student into the patient-car\"e team at the bedside and in ambulator\"y settings. After\" gr\"aduation fr\"om medical school, intensive par\"ticipation in patient car\"e begins as a par\"t of gr\"aduate medical education. Gr\"aduate medical education, commonly r\"efer\"r\"ed to as r\"esidency tr\"aining, places the physician-in-tr\"aining in a physicians/teacher\"s. The par\"ticipates in the diagnosis and management of lar\"ge number\"s of patients who pr\"esent a wide spectr\"um of disease conditions. The tr\"aining pr\"ogr\"am is designed to offer\" the to pr\"epar\"e him Or\" her\" for the independent pr\"actice of medicine. In this way the r\"esident acquir\"es the r\"equisite knowledge and skills of his Or\" her\" chosen specialty. 140 2. Societal contributions to the financing of graduate medical education are appropriate and in the best interest of society. Teaching hospitals and their residency programs provide a number of significant benefits to the general public. Certainly, all of society benefits from having an adequate supply of highly trained physicians in all medical specialties. In addition, teaching hospitals generally have more special care units such as units to treat burns or heart attack than do non-teaching hospitals. As a result, teaching hospitals often serve as the medical referral center for an area, offering tertiary care unavailable elsewhere in a community. Finally, residents under the supervision of attending physicians provide quality patient care. In the absence of residents, hospitals would be forced to utilize increased numbers of practicing physicians thereby increasing the cost of services. Because the health and well being of the American people are directly and significantly benefited by the graduate medical education of physicians, societal contributions to the financing of graduate medical education are not only appropriate but are in the best interest of society. Moreover, it would be unfair to exclude the costs of residents' services from the health care price structure when, in the price of many goods and services, Americans pay for the educational expenses incurred by companies in the training and retraining of work(rr. 3. In residency training, the education of physicians and the clinical care of patients are inextricably linked. Resident physicians provide care for patients in the course of which their knowledge and skills are advanced. Since education and patient care are so interwoven, it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate the learning and service components of graduate medical education. Thus, the AHA opposes as unproductive attempts to factor out the portion of a resident's time devoted to education. 4. Patient care revenues should continue to be the primary source of funding graduate medical education. Funds from other sources must also continue to be available to support residency training. Currently, patient care revenues account for over 80% of the financing of graduate medical education. The AHA strongly supports the continued use of patient care revenues, derived from both public and private payers, as the predominant source of funding graduate medical education for all residents, foreign medical graduates as well as graduates of U.S. medical schools. A key benefit of the existing system of funding the majority of graduate medical education costs through patient care revenues is the stable financial environment that such funding has fostered. This predictable financial environment, in which teaching hospitals are assured that paymept will be made for reasonable direct and indirect medical educatio~ costs, has been a major reason for the number of high quality teaching programs available. Also, as noted above, residents provide services that are directly attributable to patient care. 142 The AMA supports continued funding for GME from other sources, including state government funds, the Veterans Administration, federal, state and private grants, institutional gifts and endowment income. It is important to recognize, however, that no other source of funds, including faculty practice plans, is capable by itself of adequately supporting graduate medical education. 5. Teaching hospitals should \u00b7be reimbursed fully for their direct medical education costs by all public and private payers of patient care expenses. Teaching hospitals should be reimbursed fully for their reasonable direct medical education costs including the reasonable costs of residents' salaries and fringe benefits and of faculty instruction of residents. The AMA strongly opposes limiting Medicare reimbursement for direct medical educations costs to a specified number of years. We are concerned that many teaching hospitals will be unable to make up shortfalls in Medicare support for residents in long training programs. The AMA believes strongly that all public and private payers of patient care costs must contribute their proportionate share for GME expenses. For example, it is unfair for health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations to enter into contracts with teaching hospitals that allow them to avoid paying their fair share of GME costs. Such action increases the financial burden for all other payers. 143 6. The Medicare indirect medical education adjustment should be continued at an adeguate level. The Medicare indirect medical education adjustment is intended to compensate teaching hospitals for costs indirectly related to the teaching of residents. These costs include the fact that teaching hospitals treat more complex and severe cases, provide more technologically intensive care, and provide more uncompensated or insufficiently compensated care to low-income and indigent patients. In addition, because teaching hospitals usually contain many special care units, overall occupancy rates may be lower than those of non-teaching hospitals where beds may be available for general admission. The AMA supports continuation of Medicare's indirect medical education adjustment at 8.73 calculated on a curvilinear basis. Under a curvilinear approach, while a hospital's indirect medical education payment would continue to increase as its ratio of interns and resident-to-beds increases, the rate of increase would be smaller with each incremental increase in the resident-to-bed ratio. We oppose proposals that would reduce significantly the indirect medical education adjustment. A substantial reduction in the indirect adjustment would have a severe adverse impact on many teaching hospitals, particularly inner-city and major teaching hospitals that provide substantial amounts of uncompensated or inadequately compensated care. In our view, care of the indigent, whir.h is entwined in the indirect. medical education adjustment, must be recognized specifically and should be paid for by separate mechanisms. 144 7. Support for both direct and indirect medical education costs must include residents assigned to ambulatory care sites that are required components of educational programs. Clinical education in ambulatory sites is a mandated component of many residency programs. We are concerned regarding proposals or policies that would refuse to count residents who work in ambulatory care sites. Such policies would serve as a disincentive to hospitals to place residents in those sites possibly resulting in reduced primary care residency programs. Given the strong trend toward providing care in the outpatient setting, and the desire to increase the number of physicians entering the primary care specialties, it would be particularly inappropriate to penalize hospitals for placing residents in ambulatory care sites. 8. Resident physicians should not be permitted to bill directly for patient services. The AMA opposes proposals to allow resident billing as a means of reducing \u00b7the direct costs of graduate medical education because such billing would adversely affect the graduate medical education system. Of special concern is that resident billing could interfere with supervised education upon which program accreditation depends. In addition, such billing would compete with faculty practice plan billing on which medical schools depend financially. Finally, billing by residents would likely increase the cost of medical care. 145 9. Direct federal financial assistance for primary care residency programs should be continued. Currently, the federal government provides direct financial assistance to selected residency programs through grants under Title VII of the Public Health Service Act. This money supports residency training in the areas of family medicine, general internal medicine and general pediatrics. The AMA supports continued federal assistance for these important residency programs. This financial support was initiated by Congress to place greater emphasis on training in these primary care specialties. With the widespread belief that the number of primary care physicians should be increased, it would be inappropriate to eliminate funding for these residency programs. Moreover, abrupt withdrawal of support for present programs could be highly disruptive and impede development of manpower in the primary car'e areas of practice. 10. Residency training should be available to every graduate of a U.S. medical school. The configuration and the size of the graduate medical education system should at any point in time reflect anticipated health care needs of the American people. Teaching hospitals must conduct internal examinations of the programs they sponsor, assess the need for specific programs and determine the numbers of residents in these programs. The entire graduate medical education system should provide sufficient opportunities for all U.S. medical school graduates. In addition, the number of available positions should be adequate to offer a 146 measure of flexibility for graduates in the choice of institutions and the area of specialization. Graduates, however, should not be guaranteed their choice of specialty and location. 11. In a period of severe federal fiscal constraints, first priority for Medicare funding for graduate medical education should be given to graduates of medical schools accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education or the American osteopathic Association. In recent years, proposals have been advanced to eliminate Medicare funding for the residency training of graduates of foreign medical schools. In light of severe federal fiscal constraints, it would be appropriate to eliminate Medicare support for the residency training of graduates of foreign medical schools, both U.S. citizens and aliens. In our view, a gradual phasing out of Medicare support for FMG training would be needed to allow individual FMG residents already in training to complete their residency and to enable hospitals dependent on FMGs to meet current patient care needs. 12. Residents should receive reasonable compensation in all trainin~ programs. Uncompensated and under-compensated programs should be discouraged. The average annual salary of residents is $24,300. This amount is certa~nly not excessive in light of residents' education and training, the long hours they work, and the market value of the care rendered, particularly in the later years of training. 147 We are concerned that to avoid revenue shortfalls, program directors may offer uncompensated residency positions or positions compensated below institutional norms. In our view, these measures should be actions of last resort since they could compromise the quality of educational programs, diminish the value of residents' services, and make more difficult residents legitimate efforts to secure reasonable compensation. We also oppose as ill-conceived proposals to impose tuition on residents. Mr. Chairman, the AMA believes strongly that the graduate medical education system in the United States is second to none and is an essential component for assuring high quality health care for the American people. A key element in achieving our preeminent position in GME has been the existence of stable funding mechanisms. The AMA cautions you against proposing major changes in the system of financing graduate medical education. An ill-advised change could threaten our country's ability to train qualified physicians to meet our health needs in the future. 148 FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES (FMGs) Effect of Removal of FMGs Currently, there are about 12,000 foreign medical graduates (FMGs) in residency training programs in the United States. over half of these residents are training in the primary care specialties. FMGs are heavily concentrated in the states of New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Ohio, Connecticut, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. A significant reduction in the number of FMGs or the complete elimination of FMGs from residency programs would likely have a very disruptive effect on the availability of hospital-based services, especially primary care services in these states. Particularly hard hit would be hospitals located in large urban areas. In our view, if a reduction of FMGs in residency programs is initiated, a gradual phase out is needed to allow individual FMG residents already in training to complete their residency and to enable hospitals dependent on FMGs to meet current patient care needs. In addition, we do not believe it is appropriate for accrediting agencies to play a role in efforts to reduce the number of FMGs in residency programs. The sole purpose of accrediting agencies is to ensure quality. GME for International Exchange Visitors The AMA believes strongly that the United States should continue to provide graduate medical education opportunities for international exchange visitors who will then return to their native country to practice. To this.end, the AMA and other major health organizations have recently developed a plan for an International Medical Scholars Program (IMSP) that.will provide educational opportunities in the United States. 149 These FMGs will then return to leadership positions in research, practice, teaching, and administration in their native countries. The IMSP will enable the United States to resume its position of leadership in international medical education. It will also fulfill long-held moral and social obligations to international health. Accreditation of Foreign Medical Schools We are very concerned regarding the quality of medical education received by individuals at many foreign medical schools. A 1985 General Accounting Office report found that an increasing number of Americans are being trained in foreign medical schools, the quality of which are not subject to a clear set of standards to assure that graduates are qualified to provide medical care in the United States. Thus, we support any workable plan for the accrediting of foreign medical schools. Such accreditation, preferably located in the private sector, should help ensure that FMGs receive a medical education that is comparable to that provided in United States medical schools. The AMA is actively assisting regional efforts, particulal:'ly in .. Latin Amel:'ica, to develop accreditation standards. Additional Mechanisms for Evaluating FMGs The AMA also believes strongly that in order to ensure that graduates of foreign medical schools have the necessary clinical and communication skills, additional mechanisms for evaluating FMGs prior to their entry into graduate medical education should be developed. Currently, an FMG must have his credentials validated, pass an English proficiency test 150 that emphasizes written comprehension, and pass the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination in the Medical Sciences before beginning residency training. In order to guarantee the quality of FMGs prior to their entry into graduate medical education, two additional criteria should be met. First, FMGs should be required to pass an examination that demonstrates their clinical skills. Second, FMGs should be required to show verbal competency in the English language. PHYSICIAN MANPOWER The AMA recently examined the issue of physician manpower. In the following discussion we address many of the issues raised by COGME in the September 18, 1987 Federal Register notice. I. MEASURING THE ADEQUACY OF PHYSICIAN SUPPLY The threshold question is whether the supply of physicians in the U.S. is adequate to meet the country's need \u00b7for physician services. In our view, \"need for physician services\" and \"adequacy of physician supply\" are extremely complex concepts that are not easily measured. A thorough review of the literature shows that a variety of methodologies are used to analyze this issue. 151 The AMA reviewed the various methodologies used to measure the adequacy of physician supply and evaluated the advantages and disadvantages of each. These methodologies can be grouped into five broad categories. In order of their complexity, they are: o physician-to-population ratios; o measures of physician\u00b7 accessibility; o professional and community satisfaction; o econometric analyses; and o professional standards. None of these methodologies provides a completely satisfactory standard by which to measure the adequacy of physician supply. Furthermore, the various methodologies do not always produce a consistent picture about whether there are too many or too few physician to meet the country's needs. However, in spite of their .. shortcomings, the methodologies play a necessary role in the formulation of physician manpower policy. They represent the different sources of information upon which policy makers base their beliefs and judgments about the adequacy of physician supply. Consequently, it is important to develop a thorough understanding of the different methodologies and to be fully aware of their relative strengths and weaknesses. Physician-to-Population-Ratios The physician-to-population ratio is the most commonly used indicator of the adequacy of physician supply. This ratio, usually expressed as the number of active physicians per 100,000 population, is a useful index in analyzing the availability of physician services across geographic areas or between different points in time. 152 The chief advantages of physician-to-population ratios are that they are easy to compute and have broad intuitive appeal. Also, these ratios have been adapted for many different types of studies. For example, physician-to-population ratios can be calculated for individual specialties or for the population of a specific age-group. These types of analyses are often used to locate shortage (or surplus) areas for physicians of a given specialty. When the ratios are used in this context, care must be given to address the level of services appropriate to the locale. Analyses of physician-to-population ratios are complicated by the fact that not all physicians have the same level of productivity and not all segments of the population have the same demand for physician services. Physician productivity is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including physician sex, age, and modality of practice. Similarly, the demand for physician services is influenced by the age and sex distributions of the general population. To some extent, the variation in productivity and demand can be incorporated into the study of physician-to-population ratios by analyzing full-time-equivalent (FTE) physicians and by making adjustments for the effects of population composition. Comparisons of the ratios may be misleading if these factors are not taken into consideration. Simple analyses of projected trends in the physician-to-population ratio do not take into consideration that the aging of the U.S. population may cause the demand for physician services to increase faster than the growth rate of the general population. Also, such analyses do 153 not take into account the wide variety of factors influencing physician productivity, such as the changing modes of health care delivery, and the impact of future technological innovations . . Perhaps the most significant shortcoming in the use of physician-to-population ratios is that they do not provide normative standards for determining the adequacy of physician supply. That is, they do not by themselves indicate whether the supply of physicians is inadequate for, in parity with, or in surplus of the population's need for physician services. Measures of Accessibility The adequacy of physician supply is often related to the public's accessibility to physician services. This accessibility depends not only on physician supply, but also on the geographic and specialty distributions of the physician population and the availability of physicians. to the public --i.e, whether patients can see physicians when and where they wish. Accessibility to physician services depends on many factors, including: o whether local physicians accept new patients; o distance between the patient's home and the physician's off ice; o lead time required for an appointment; o waiting time in the physician's office before an appointment; o convenience of office hours; and o the amount of time physicians spend with patients. 154 Accessibility to physicians' services is an important concept in influencing the public's perceptions about the adequacy of physician supply. Nevertheless, the relationship between physician supply and accessibility is very complex, partly because the geographic distribution of physicians is much different from that of the general population. In some rural areas, physicians are still in short supply. Patients often do not have adequate accessibility to physician services because of\u00b7 the long distances between their homes and physician offices. However, several studies have shown that the maldistribution of physicians has eased in recent years. A recent analysis by Newhouse, et al. shows that the expanding physician supply has led many physicians to move to small towns and cities where no physician of their specialty had practiced previously. Thus, the analysis indicates that recent growth in the physician population has imp.roved the geographic accessibility of physicians in rural areas. However, it is not realistic to expect that continued growth in physician supply will correct completely this problem. Physician accessibility is also determined by the availability of physicians to their patients in terms of the lead time needed for an appointment, the average amount of waiting time in a physician's office, and the amount of time physicians spend with patients during an average patient visit. Data from the AMA's Socioeconomic Monitoring System (SMS) show that between 1982 and 1985 the average lead time needed for an appointment decreased from 6.9 to 6.2 days. However, little change is seen either in the SMS data for the amount of waiting time at the physician's office or in data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care 155 Survey on the duration of office visits. While these data on physician availability are interesting in their own right, the AMA does not believe that they should be used by themselves for the purpose of analyzing physician supply. Professional and Community Satisfaction Researchers and policy makers often base their beliefs about the adequacy of physician supply on whether the general public (and/or physician population) perceives the supply of physicians to be adequate. In these studies, additional surveys are used to measure a population's degree of satisfaction with existing physician supply. If both the general public and physician population are satisfied, one would conclude that the supply of physicians is adequate. The main advantage of working with this type of data is that it provides the most direct information possible about the public's perceptions about the adequacy of physician supply. However, there are several disadvantages. Most of the public is not well-informed about the supply of physicians, and certain segments of the population may have unreasonable expectations about how many physicians can be supported in a given community. It is difficult to interpret disagreements among different segments of the general public or between the general public and the physician population. Also, decisfons have to be made about what level of satisfaction is necessary for the physician population to be considered adequate. Consequently, it is difficult to develop a normative standard on the adequacy of physician supply with this sort of attitudinal data. 156 Data from recent AMA attitudinal surveys show that in 1984 the majority of the general public (593) believed there was about the right number of doctors in their community; 123 thought there were too many doctors, and 263 thought there were too few. In general, the perceptions of physicians about the adequacy of physician supply were less sanguine than those of the general public. Nearly half (433) believed there were too many physicians in their community, and 743 believed there was a current or impending surplus of physicians in certain specialty areas in their community. These views were also reflected in analyses of individual specialties. For instance, in a 1982 study of orthopedic surgeons, 423 said there were too many members of their specialty in their community and the same proportion said their surgical practices were operating below capacity. The AMA is also concerned about the attitudes eiq>ressed by some physicians toward the current professional environment. The AMA believes that physicians' professional satisfaction is determined, in part, by their ability to effectively utilize the skills they have developed. The increasingly competitive environment has caused some physicians to shift from their specialty of choice and consequently has limited their professional satisfaction. Econometric Analyses The methodologies described above do not take into account how market forces affect the demand for medical services and influence beliefs about whether the supply of physicians is adequate. However, several recent 157 studies have drawn inferences about the adequacy of physician supply by analyzing the relationship between physician supply and physician income. These studies can be divided into two groups. o Analyses of \"relative income\" compare the average annual income of physicians to the incomes of other professions. One infers that the supply of physicians is increasing relative to demand whenever the incomes of physicians decrease relative to the salaries of individuals in comparable professions. o Analyses of the \"rate of return to medical education\" consider medical education as an investment in human capital, and physician income is considered to be a return on that investment. According to these analyses, an increase in the supply of physicians relative to demand is associated with a decrease in physician income relative to the cost of a medical education. Unfortunately, there is little consensus among these studies about whether there is currently a surplus of physicians. A general criticism of the econometric approach to analyzing physician supply is that it focuses on the \"demand\" for physician services rather than on the concept of \"need.\" However, it is essential that \"need\" and \"demand\" be measured if a complete analysis of physician supply is to be obtained. Professional Standards Of the five different approaches to measuring the adequacy of phvslcian supply, only the professional standards approach is truly ~\"rmat!.ve, providing an estimate of the number of physicians required to satisfy a population's \"need\" for health care. The methodology for this approach, developed by Lee and Jones in 1933, requires the following four pieces of information: 158 o estimates of how frequently each type of illness occurs in a given population; o perceptions of a panel of experts regarding the amount and type of health services required to treat each type of illness; o the panel's perceptions on the amount of time required to provide each type of service; and o their perceptions of the average amount of time different types of providers spend in patient care. The professional standards methodology was further adapted in the Graduate Medical Educational National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) study to project future requirements for physicians. The GMENAC study used an \"adjusted needs\" based model to estimate these requirements. Panels of experts analyzed data on the prevalence of disease to estimate future need for health care services. These estimates were adjusted to take into account societal barriers and constraints preventing the delivery of these services, and then the \"adjusted needs\" for health services were allotted among physicians and other health professionals. Data on the content and productivity of physician practices were used to calculate future requirements for physicians in each specialty, and these projected requirements were then compared with the projected supply of physicians. The large amount of complex information required by the professional standards approach is a major disadvantage of this type of analysis. In the process of developing estimates and setting standards, it is necessary to resolve many issues in a fairly arbitrary fashion. Decisions must be made on a wide variety of issues, including sometimes tacit assumptions about how the quality of care varies (or is the same) among different providers. Furthermore, when the professional standards 159 approach is used to project the need for physicians at some future date, the analyses require arbitrary assumptions about future trends in the prevalence of disease and treatment regimes. These arbitrary decisions are ultimately reflected in the projections of need. Another difficulty with the professional standards approach is that it has traditionally been built around the concept of the epidemiological \"need\" for health care without proper consideration of economically determined \"demand.\" Estimates of physician requirements based on \"need\" will be overstated if society will not finance the physician services deemed necessary to meet those needs. The findings of the GMENAC study give strong support to the perception of a physician surplus. Its analysis estimated that there would be a surplus of 70,000 physicians by 1990 and a surplus of 145,000 physicians in 2000. The study found that in 1990 most specialties would have an oversupply. Several specialties would be in near balance, including the primary care specialties of family practice, general internal medicine, and general pediatrics. Shortages were projected for psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, preventive medicine, and emergency medicine. On the basis of these findings, GMENAC made 40 reconunendations, including: o a 173 decrease in medical school enrollment; o further restrictions on the entry of foreign medical graduates into the U.S.; and o no further increases in the number of allied health professionals being trained. 160 The GMENAC findings proved to be very controversial. The methodology of the study was criticized for a wide variety of reasons, including: the inadequacies of the data utilized; the arbitrary assumptions embodied in models used to estimate \"need\" for health care; and problems in the organization of the expert panels used to estimate the requirements of services. Despite these criticisms, the GMENAC study has proved to be the most important projection of physician requirements in recent years, setting a standard to which other such projections are compared. Complexities in Measuring the Adeguacy of Physician Supply The application of these methodologies to the U.S. health care system produces little consensus about the adequacy of physician supply. This lack of consensus is largely because \"need for physician services\" and \"physician productivity\" are nebulous concepts, and there is little agreement on how they should be defined or measured. The \"need for physician services\" is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including: o amount and distribution of illness; o the sociodemographic characteristics of the general population; o the method of health care financing; and o population lifestyles. Changes in these factors make it difficult to estimate future need for physician services. On the one hand, the aging of the general population will increase the need for many types of physician services. However, owing to other developments, this increase in need may not be 161 fully satisfied. In recent years, there has been increasing pressure to reduce payment for services covered by Medicaid and Medicare due to the growing fiscal conservatism of the federal government together with increases in national expenditures for health care. Further cuts in the Medicare program may reduce the impact of the aging population on demand for physician services. In addition, healthier lifestyles of the general population and the greater use of preventive health care are also likely to reduce future demand for physician services. The adequacy of physician supply is also determined by factors affecting physician productivity, such as the: number of patient visits per week; number of hours per week worked by physicians; mode of health care delivery; and technical innovations. Physician productivity is also influenced by the mode of health care delivery. The ratio of physicians to patients in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) is considerably lower than the general physician-to-population ratio for the entire U.S. Consequently, the growing prevalence of these types of payment systems will increase effective physician supply. A recent study by Steinwachs, et al., compared staffing patterns of primary care physicians in three HMOs with the national requirements for physicians projected for 1990 by GMENAC. The analysis showed that when the data from HMO staffing requirements were incorporated into the GMENAC methodology, the projected physician requirements would be reduced 203 for pediatricians and 503 for primary care physicians treating adults. These findings indicate that there would be a significant reduction in the number of required physicians in the U.S. if the entire U.S. population were to be enrolled in HMOs and if HMOs maintain their relatively low physician-patient staffing ratios. 162 The relationship between physician supply and physician productivity is further confounded by changes in the composition of the physician population. The number of female physicians is projected to increase by 90 percent between 1985 and 2000 in contrast to a 25 percent increase in the number of male physicians. Women physicians have traditionally worked fewer hours and have had fewer patient visits per week than male physicians. AMA data indicate that female physicians have lower productivity than male physicians, working 90 percent as many hours per week in patient care activities and having 75 percent as many patient visits per week. If this sex differential persists, a small proportion of the projected increase in physician supply will be offset by the growing proportion of female physicians. However, recent studies indicate that differences in the productivity of male and female physicians have decreased\u00b7in recent years. Technological innovations in medical care are also likely to have a strong impact on the effectiveness of physician supply, although it is difficult to predict what the net effect of these innovations will be. In some cases, the development of new procedures or treatment regimes will increase overall patient demand for physician services, thereby absorbing part of the projected physician surplus. In other cases, a newly developed procedure or treatment will replace several less efficient ones, thereby increasing the effectiveness of physician supply. 163 Concerns About a Physician Oversupply A major concern of the AMA is that a surplus of physicians could lower the quality and raise the costs of physician services. There are several reasons for this concern. First, it is possible that as competition among health care providers becomes more intense and as the volume of physician practices shrink, physicians may not perform certain procedures frequently enough to maintain a high level of skill. As of yet, no study has analyzed the relationship between the size of a physician's practice and the quality of care. However, in related research it was found that better outcomes for surgical patients were more likely in high-volume hospitals. A second area of concern is the large amount of primary care in the United States that is actually provided by physicians trained in nonprimary care specialties. As competition in the health care delivery system increases, a growing proportion of specialists may start providing primary care in order to compensate for the lower demand for specialty services. Since specialists tend to charge more than generalists for comparable services, and have a more technology-intensive approach to treatment, the cost of primary care would increase without necessarily improving quality. Third, at least part of the increase in the nation's health care expenditures has been related to increases in supply. Recent studies have shown that the larger supply of physicians has resulted in higher expenditures for health care. Sloan and Schwartz estimated that 223 of the increase in real annual expenditures for physician services between 164 1970 and 1979 was related to an increase in the physician-to-population ratio. (This finding does not connote that the added services are unnecessary or inappropriate. It is equally logical to conclude that the increase in supply results in better access to needed services.) Finally, a significant part of the recent growth in physician supply has been due to physicians trained in foreign medical schools. The AMA is concerned about the quality of training provided by some foreign medical schools. Allowing physicians who do not have adequate medical training to practice in the U.S. will have a negative impact on the quality of health care in this country. II. OVERVIEW OF PHYSICIAN MANPOWER POLICIES A wide variety of policies has affected the supply of physicians during the last two decades. This section provides an overview of these policies. The first part describes three broad categories of physician manpower policies, and the second part describes how these policies have affected the supply of physicians since the late 1960s. The AMA reviewed a wide variety of physician manpower policies. These policies can be grouped into the following three broad categories based on the locus of decision-making: o market-oriented policies, which favor decentralized decision-making by plwsicians and patients; o public initiativr~, in which the authority to make decisions is centralized in state and federal governments; and o private initiatives, in which policy decisions are made by nongovernmental bodies, including health care organizations such as the AMA. In practice, manpower policies are combinations of each of these three categories which are described in more detail below. 165 Market-oriented policies. Market-oriented policies rely on the discretion of individual physicians and patients to make the decisions that are best for their personal needs. Patients are free to choose their providers and the amount of care they are willing to purchase. Physicians are free to choose the mode and location of their practices and to determine the fees for the services they provide. The market controls the number of physicians and is permitted to increase or decrease with the attractiveness of medicine relative to comparable professions. In the past, the AMA has advocated market-oriented policies because they offer maximum autonomy to physicians and other health providers, and they allow patients to choose their providers and the amount of care they wish to receive on the basis of their own personal preferences. Furthermore, market-oriented policies tend to be self-regulating. However, the self-regulating aspects of the marketplace work most efficiently in an environment free of external regulations, and there has not been a regulation-free medical care market in recent years. Since the 1960s, market-oriented policies have generally not been used to determine the size of the physician population. Entry into the profession is largely controlled by policies set in the public sector (e.g., determination of class size of universities, immigration policies and funding for training programs). Many of these policies artificially encourage the production of physicians, and interfere with the self-regulating aspects of market-oriented policies. 166 Public initiatives. Government policies influence the supply of physician manpower in a number of ways --through state and federal government subsidies for medical education, through immigration laws which determine the number of foreign-born physicians, through the licensing of physicians, and, indirectly, through government programs that have increased the demand for physician services. While the AMA recognizes the legitimate role of state and federal governments in the health care system, we strongly oppose government regulations which restrict the professional autonomy of physicians. Such regulations often exacerbate problems instead of eliminate them. Private initiatives. The AMA, along with other health organizations, is involved in many different aspects of physician manpower policy. The various aspects of the AMA's manpower policy are based on the AMA's primary goal to provide quality medical care to the American people. The following three types of activities are consistent with this desire: o working with other organizations, including state and federal governments, to develop policies that are consistent with quality health care; o analyzing and disseminating information about trends in the health care delivery system; and o creating programs to help individual physicians provide better care by increasing the efficiency of their practices. The three types of activities .described above have played an important part in influencing physician supply and will continue to influence the supply and distribution of physicians in the future. The AMA believes that efforts must be made to coordinate all three levels of decision-making so that the best aspects of each is implemented. 167 Physician Manpower Policies Since the 1960s During the 1960s and early 1970s, there was a consensus in both the government and the private sector that the U.S. physician population should be increased. This perception was based, in part, on a series of reports indicating a serious shortage of physicians in the U.S; and on the Medicare-Medicaid legislation of 1965-66 which was expected to increase greatly the public's demand for health care services. In response, federal legislation was passed and administrative regulations were developed to encourage the growth of the physician population. These actions included: o the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1963, which provided construction funds to expand the size and number of medical schools; o the Health Manpower Act of 1968, which provided loans and scholarships to medical students and additional funds for construction of medical school facilities and operation costs; and o a statement by the Department of Labor in 1965 that there was a physician shortage, thus giving preferred status to alien physicians wishing to immigrate to the U.S. These actions were extremely effective. Between 1965 and 1975, the number of U.S. medical schools increased from 88 to 114 and the number of f lrst-year medical students rose fr.om 8, 759 to 15, 351. In the middle 1970s, the general perception of a physician shortage began to fade. In 1976, Congress passed P.L. 94-484, which severely restricted the flow of alien foreign medical graduates into the U.S. Already at that time, many people were concerned about the possibility that the U.S. was training more physicians than needed. GMENAC was formed to determine how many physicians were required to bring supply 168 into balance with the nation's needs for physician services. During the late 1970s, the federal government stopped providing capitation payments to medical schools, thereby eliminating incentives to maintain large enrollments. In 1980, GMENAC completed its Final Report, which projected a surplus of 70,000 physicians by 1990. Moreover, in the early 1980s further restrictions were placed on the entry of alien foreign medical graduates into residency programs. The general perception of a physician shortage during the 1960s was the basis of manpower legislation which created programs to increase physician supply. The AMA believes that this legislation, a reaction to a perceived problem, became the vehicle by which more physicians have been and are now being trained than can be efficiently or effectively accommodated by the U.S. health care system. Thus, the continued rapid growth in physician supply is a result of the past overreaction to a perceived physician shortage. It is imperative that current policy-makers heed the lessons of the past. Physician manpower policies which are incorrectly formulated will be a major source of problems in the health care system 20 years hence. care must be taken to develop policies that will not inadvertently limit the chances of certain groups entering the physician population. The AMA is particularly sensitive to the situation of blacks and other minorities who are still underrepresented in U.S. medical schools. The high cost of medical education and the growing competition in the health care system may further reduce the entry of these groups into the medical education system. 169 III. CONCLUSIONS There is no generally accepted single standard by which to measure the adequacy of physician supply. In the absence of such a standard, physician manpower policies must be based on the perceptions and professional judgment of policy makers together with the best available data and research on this complex issue. The analyses by GMENAC and a recent report by the Bureau of Health Professions indicate the projected supply of physicians will exceed requirements in 1990. The AMA's research on supply adds credence to the projections on the growth in numbers of physicians. The state of knowledge on the demand or requirement side is weaker. The Association has underway a research program designed to examine these issues. The available data for the nation as a whole suggests that oversupply or surplus is much more likely than undersupply. Physician mobility across specialty groups and geographic borders significantly complicates specialty or area-specific analyses. The Association is concerned that imbalances of whatever kind can adversely affect the health of the American people. Market forces cannot be relied on to adjust the growth rate of the U.S. physician population because the U.S. health care system does not operate in a free market. While the short-term growth of the physician population is unavoidable (due to the large number of medical students and residents already in the medical education pipeline), we are .convinced that the negative consequences of long-term growth must be minimized. 170 Accordingly we believe that certain initial steps should be taken: A. The U.S. medical education system should be encouraged to review data and analyses regarding physician supply and its impact on the quality and cost of care so that educators can appropriately establish the size of total enrollment. This could be accomplished by the following actions: o Participation of all sectors of the U.S. medical education system in the planning and decision-making that will determine the size of the physician manpower pool in the future. o Careful review by U.S. medical schools of the size of their current first-year enrollment. Decreases in student enrollments should not lead to decreased funding, if the quality of medical education programs is to be maintained. If reductions in educational and training capacity are to be imposed on the medical education system, these reductions should begin with the first-year of medical school. Reductions in graduate medical education should. not be made until the output of U.S. medical schools is reduced. Otherwise, U.S. medical school graduates may be unable to find funded residency slots to complete their medical training. B. The current level of funding for medical education should be maintained despite potential decreases in student enrollments if the current quality of medical education is to be maintained. At the present time, many medical schools are not adequately funded. If future levels of funding are dependent on class size, many medical schools would be forced to maintain existing enrollments in order to remain financially sound. 171 Furthermore, a reduction in funding could jeopardize the research activities of medical schools. c. Federal legislation and regulations that mandate maintaining specified enrollment in U.S. medical schools should be repealed. We also advocate the repeal of any state laws mandating maintenance of specified enrollments at state-supported medical schools. These actions would provide a clear expression of public policy that a medical school should not be penalized financially if a determination is made that it should reduce enrollment in order to ensure an appropriate level of quality in its educational program. D. The enrollment in U.S. medical schools of blacks and other underrepresented groups should be supported. In any reduction process, their continued enrollment should be encouraged. . E. Appropriate quality standards and criteria for the practice of medicine must be promoted. Accreditation ~riteria must always be based soley on reasonable quality standards and may not be used for any 0th.er purposes. Where concerns about quality are documented, accrediting bodies have an obligation to take corrective action, regardless of the secondary effects. Thus the accreditation of foreign medical schools by the LCME or some other body in the private sector should be considered. In addition, residency program directors should be encouraged to thoroughly screen the credentials of all applicants for residency positions to ensure that they have had sufficient preparatory .education. Finally, we advocate the continued development of more effec\u00b7tive state licensing and disciplinary criteria. 172 This statement responds to many of the Council's specific questions. AMA's ongoing manpower research program will continue to address the many open issues on physician manpower policy. The AMA commends COGME for holding this hearing and appreciates the opportunity to testify. We urge that each COGME subcommittee hold a hearing before making final recommendations. Mr. Chairman, I will be happy to answer any ques~ions members of the Council may have. 3265p TMW:dwc 173 Test I mooy of the Med I ca I Soc I ety c;if the State of New Yo.lli Before the Counci I on ~aduate Medical Education Department of Health and Human Services, Health Resources and Secy Ices Adn!I n j st rat I on Del i ye red on November 19 . 1987. at Bethesda, Mary J and Distinguished members of the Council, on behalf of the Medical Society of the State of New York, I would like to express our appreciation for this opportunity to address you concerning some of the critical Issues relating to the graduate medical education system lo the United States. My name Is Dr-. Dav Id Ben ford and I am the VI ce-Pres I dent of the Med I ca I Society of the State of New York, also serve as the President of the Empire State Medical, Scientific and Educational Foundation, which Is the the Peer Review Organization for Medicare in New York State, Although this bearing Is prlmarily aimed at exploring the natlonal dimensions of the graduate medical education system, we be! ieve that recent developments In New York State provide an excel Jent example of the potential dangers which can arise If graduate medical education Is approached on a state by state basis, and we felt therefor that these developments should be brought to this Couocl I 1s attention. In 1984 the Governor of New York State directed the Commissioner of Health to establish a C0mmission on Graduate Medical Education (GME). This Commission was cha.I red by Al feed Gel I horn, M.D. and has become informally 175 known as the 11Gel I horn Commission\". As part of its work, the Gel lhorn Commission was charged with reviewing and making recommendations on some thirteen Issues of \"particular concern\", such as: \"1. The appropriate number and types of post-graduate residency and tel lowshlp positions for New York State; 2. An evaluation of New York State's graduate medical education programs as a national resource; 3, The impact of graduate medical education on health care costs; 4. The responsibi I ity of, and opportunity for, graduate medical education to assist in meeting the needs of medical Jy underserved populations in the State, and priority needs of State Institutions and tac i I It I es; 5. The relationship between the number of graduate medical education positions and the uo~ergraduate medical school class size Jn the State; 6. The respor> ~ i I i ty of, and opportun I ty for, graduate med I ca I education to increc>e the proportion of minority physicians practicing In the State; 7. The ider; +\u00b7cation of incentives for increasing the emphasis on alternatives to 'r~'' \u00b7ant care in post-graduate medical education; 176 8. The role of pub I ic and private academic medical centers In meeting State health and medical needs; 9. The protect I on of hosp i ta I pa.t I en ts from poor I y educated and poor I y trained residents and tel lows; 10. The development of means for Influencing the supply and distribution of specialists to fulfi I I defined social needs of the State, Including use of the State's reimbursement process, grants and contracts, and the regulatory process; 11. The reduction of State support to graduate medical education in specialties where an oversupply already exists and the determination of the obstacles to reducing dupl lcatlve tertiary care services; 12. The evaluation of the effect of a substitution of physician extenders and other health personnel for residents; 13. The development of a mechanism for long-range graduate education planning.\" The above need to be addressed, but the Medical Society of the State of New.York would not agree with some of the methods recommended by the Gel lhorn Commission to resolve them. In February 1986, the Gel I horn Commission completed Its work and 177 pub I ished Its report* which contained numerous \"recommendations for changes\" that the Commission \"deemed advlsable\" In order to Improve the operation of the graduate medlcal education system in New York State. The Medical Society of the State of New York rev_te'wed_ this report carefully and was shocked and dismayed at some of its more controversial recommendations. Perhaps the most objectionable part of the Gel thorn Commission Report was not any one particular recommendation but rather the extent to which the Comm Issi on wou Id centra I I ze author I ty for the adm In I strati on of graduate medical education programs (including control of the funding mechanisms) In a state agency, namely the New York State Department of Health and to a lesser extent, the New York State Department of Education. The graduate medical education system In New York, as envisioned by the Ge I I horn Commission, wou Id ostens i b I y be governed by reg Iona I consortia, composed of a medical school, the major regional teaching center and the affl I lated hospitals in the region. In reality, however, the Commissioner of Health would have the ultimate authority over the operation of the system as he would control the distribution of graduate medical education funds and this \"power of the purse\" would almost automatically guarantee control of the system, Funding for graduate medical education under the Gel thorn Commission Report would be acco\"pl ished through a pool Ing of the graduate medical educat I on component no\" inc I uded In payments made by th I rd party payers. *Report of the New York State Commission on Graduate Medical Education February 1986 178 Even graduate medical education payments made by Medicare would be Included In this pool If the appropriate federal waivers could be obtained. Although the Ge 11 horn Report I tse If fa I Is to spec I fy who w 111 actual I y contro I these \u00b7 pooled funds, legislation proposed by the New York State Department of Health, which would Implement the findings of the Gel lhorn Commission, makes It clear that the Commissioner of Health wll I ultimately determine which programs receive funding and which do not. Under the proposed leglslatlon, funding would only be provided to those programs which meet preset and often reduced targets for, among other things, the number of residency positions In each area, the distribution of physicians by specialty, and the degree to which residents are replaced with salaried physicians and physician extenders. Thus the et feet of the Ge I I horn Report and its comp an I on I mp I ementi ng legislation would be to al low the State of New York to establ !sh total contro I of the Gi\u00b7lE system by having the New York State Department of Health (DOH) and to c: lesser extent the Department of Education (DOE) enter the domain of ciccreditation and funding of educational programs. The Medical Society of the State of New York believes strongly that such concentrated control of graduate medical education by an Individual state agency Is Inappropriate and clearly not In the best interests of the medical education system or tee people of New York State. The Medical Society of the State of New Yer> has repeatedly opposed the Introduction of a State system for the regulc\"on of graduate medical education. It holds the view that the current sys0\u00b7 of accrediting residency programs has proven to be effective In assurin,; the maintenance of top qua I lty residency programs both 179 in New York State and throughout the country. We do not bel !eve that a patchwork quilt of lndlvldual state regulations can properly take Into consideration the legitimate national and state Interests In preserving a uniform and open graduate medical education system. It is interesting to note that the Gel !horn Commission also proposes to Invest the state's plan with an air of objectivity and balance through the creation of a Council on GME composed of external consultants acting as an \"advisory group\" to the New York State Departments of Health and Education. The members of the Counci I have been appointed by the Commissioners of those very same Departments. This certainly would compromise the Counci I 1s objectivity in evaluating and recommending changes in the graduate medical education system. In our view the Gel ihorn Commission Report, which is receiving serious consideration in New York State, failed to recognize that a national systen. for standard-setting and review of performance and accreditation of graduate medical education is already in existence. In fact, the only concession made by the Commission to the importance of maintaining a national standard is a recommendation that the standards of the national accrediting bodies be met along with any additional standards developed by New York State. The graduate medical education system in New York State could therefore be comp! icated and even compromised by the adoption of additional standards recommended by the new a I I eged I y \"r ndependent\" Counc i I, Fa 11 ure to ineet one of these new standards could lead, in effect, to State disaccredftatlon of a hosp Ital 1s nationally approved residency training program. Furthermore, in the event that the Department of Health were to obtain control over the 180 distribution of graduate medical education funds to hospitals, the hospitals would be virtually forced to comply with even clearly Inappropriate rules In order to assure that the State release the needed funds. Aside from the Issue of centralized authority In the Department of Health, the Gel !horn Commission also made several substantive recommenda\u00ad tions which we believe are worthy of comment. One recommendation was to reduce the number of residency slots In New York State to approximate the number of medical students graduating from New York medical schools each year. This would result in a reduction of approximately 30% of the present residency positions. Aside from potential hospital manpower problems which th Is recommendation might tr I gger It a I so fa I Is to recogn I ze New York State's unique national position in the training of our nation's physicians. The Medical Society of the State of Nevi York ls justifiably proud of the caliber of the residency training programs in our state and we see no need to alter the system by arbitrarily I Inking the number of training opportu\u00ad nities In New York tc the number of New York medical school graduates. The Gel I horn Cu\u00b7\"'isslon Report also recommended that the proportion of residents who are tr< \u00b7ning in New York who are graduates of foreign medical schools should be 'cc'.,ced within five years time from the present average statewide level of -,: to not more than 10%. (Waivers may be permitted in exceptional circ.,r .\u00b7 \u00b7ces.) This proposed c:\u00b7oss the board cut fa! Is to consider the tact that New York State forei;n -0~;cal graduates play an essential role in staffing 181 those hospitals that care for the poor end the mentally 111. Foreign medical graduates serve as residents in a much higher proportion than graduates of U.S. medical schools In these hospitals. No adequate plan to substitute for foreign medical graduates as residents In these hospitals has been put forward. We would also note that even if the plan proposed by the Gel lhorn Commission were rationally conceived, it seems fool lsh for the State to run ahead of the Federal Government in devising restrictive formulas for control I Ing the entry of foreign medical graduates at a time when the subject is on the Congressional agenda. This Issue Is a national Issue and thus ls most amenable to a national approach, Another critical recommendation of the Get thorn Commission ls a proposa 1 to rad i ca I I y s I ash the amount of funds ava i 1 ab I e for med I ca I and pediatric subspeclalty training programs In New York State and redirect those funds to primary care physician training. Whl le an Increase In the ' number of prirr.ary care physicians may Indeed be a good Idea, we believe that the proposed approach is extremely shortsighted. Prospective physicians should be able to choose their field of practice without undue governmental intrusion. Furtherrnore we feel that market considerations, coupled with prudent but not arbitrary governmental decision making on a national level can best assure the o~\u00b7tirnum mix of residency positions. Permitting state governmental intrusion in this area would be both inadvisable and I nef fect Ive. 182 No greater example of the danger of a state by state provincial approach to residency training can be found than In the New York State Plan for Graduate Medical Education. Under .the proposed plan, funding for residents in medicine and pediatrics would be strictly I tmlted to the three year period required for the Initial el tg!bl I tty for American Board Certification. Present support of subspeclalty training In New York State would generally be discontinued and the present excel lent programs for such training would disappear. The Medical Society of the State of New York believes that such a result would be extremely undestrable and could even result in a shortage of special tsts in certain areas. The Medical Society of the State of New York further believes that a coordinated national approach is essential to assure the avai labi I tty of both primary care physicians and special tsts and that attempts by any individual state to arbltrari ly I imit specialty training would be counterproductive. Furthermore, It ts difficult to reconct le the Gel lhorn.Commtssion1s acceptance of discrepant funding periods for medicine and surgery, especially the much longer period of contemplated payment for surglcal residencies, with the Commission's other recommendations. It appears to be I nterna I I y i neons i stent with the genera I thrust of the Commission recommendations, i.e. to reduce spectal lzation and increase primary care residency positions. It also appears that several of the premises apparently rel led on by the Gel I horn Commiss ;or in this area are flawed in that they seem to assume that only primary care physicians are in short supply and that physician surpluses are found primarily in the medical subspectalty area, To the contrary, according to the study of the Graduate Medtcal Education Advisory 183 Committee (GMENAC), general surgery Is projected to have the greatest surplus of any specialty yet the Gel lhorn Commission recommends no decrease In funding. Conversely, Hematology/Oncology, a medlcal subspeclalty, Is expected to have a considerable shortage. It is also noteworthy that the Gel I horn Commission cl lngs to the belief that only primary care residencies are worthy of funding. The funding for specialty tel lowshlps In geriatrics would also be a casualty, an area where trained physicians are clearly essential as our populatlon ages. I have attempted during my testimony to point out what the Medical Society of the State of New York sees as the flaws Inherent In both the concept of lndlvidual state regulatlon of graduate medlcal education as wel I as the specific problems with the approach advocated for New York State by the Gel lhorn Commission. The Medical Society of the State of New York belleves that our state should remain a resource for high quality training of medlcal graduates, not only for the state, but also for the nation as a whole. We believe strongly that any change In the current system of graduate medical education funding and operation should only be considered In the context of a national approach to the Issue after a thorough and unbiased Investigation of fhe many complex Issues Involved. We stand ready to assist you In ani\u00b7 .ay we can in that ongoing Investigation. Once again, I wish to thank yoc ~er al lowing us the opportunity to testify today. 184 El'.'JUCATIONAL COMMISSION far FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES 3624 MARKET STREET, PHILADELPHIA. PENNSYLVANIA 19104-2665, U.SA 0 PHONE: 216 366-5900 0 CABLE: EDCOUNCIL, PHILADELPHIA November 19, 1987 COMPARISON OF THE FMGEMS AND THE NBME PART I AND PART II EXAMINATIONS JOINT STATEMENT BY ECFMG AND NBME The Foreign Medical Graduate Examination in the Medical Sciences (FMGEMS) is an examination developed cooperatively by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) and the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) to assess knowledge in the basic medical and clinical sciences. Graduates of foreign medical schools (regardless of citizenship) are required to pass FMGEMS to satisfy the medical science examination requirement for ECFMG certification. ECFMG certification provides assurance to directors of ACGME-accredited programs and to the people of the United States that graduates of foreign medical schools have met minimum standards of eligibility required to enter such programs. ECFMG certification is also a prerequisite for licensure to practice medicine in most states in the United States. For alien physicians to obtain visas to enter the United States to perform services as members of the medical profession or to receive graduate medical education, as required under provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Public Law 94-484) they must pass the NBME Part I and Part II examinations or an examination determined to be equivalent. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has recognized FMGEMS as equivalent to the NBME Part I and II examinations for this purpose. During the construction phase of FMGEMS, items (questions) from the NBME pool of test questions are identified for possible incl us ion in FMGEMS. All of the items selected for incl us ion in FMGEMS have been used in recent NBME Part I and Part II examinations and must meet a number of content and measurement requirements. With respect to content, 70 items are selected from each of the seven basic medical science subjects for inclusion in Day 1 of FMGEMS and 75 from each of the six clinical science subjects for inclusion in Day 2 of FMGEMS. This parallels the proportional representation of these same subjects in. the NBME Part I and Part II examinations. For example, there are approximately 150 items in each of the clinical science subjects of NBME Part II; since FM(;;EMS is half the length of the Part II examination, there are 75 items from each of these subjects in Day 2 of FMGEMS. In addition, the items from each of the content categories within each basic medical science and clinical science subject are selected proportionately based upon the content category allocations currently used in the construction of the NBME Part I and Part II examinations. For example, all the categories within the biochemistry subject on NBME Part I are represented in the same proportion on the FMGEMS examination. This is done for all of the subjects so that FMGEMS, although half the length of the NBME Part I and II examinations, is comparable in terms of content. With respect to measurement characteristics of FMGEMS, item statistics are available for all items in the NBME test item pool based on the performance of students and graduates from LCME accredited schools who answered these questions on the NBME Part I and Part II. The item statistics of interest are item JBS difficulty (how easy or hard the item was to answer correctly by examinees) and test-item correlation (data indicating how well individual items relate to the overall examination). Using these data, test items are selected for the subjects in FMGEMS that are equal in average difficult and average test-item correlations to those same subjects on NBME Part I and II examinations. In addition to these average values, the ranges of item difficulty and ranges of test-item correlation are matched against the ranges for these same data from the NBME examinations. This effort assures that FMGEMS is comparable in terms of difficulty and test-item correlations to recent NBME Part I and II examinations. Since there are four different types of item formats within the NBME item pool, consideration is also given to the format of items selected for FMGEMS. The items selected for FMGEMS are matched in terms of this characteristic against the NBME Part I and Part II examinations. This step provides assurance that approximately the same proportion of each of the item types that appear in the NBME examinations also appear in FMGEMS, including a reasonably close match in the number of items related to pictorial material. As part of a final step, the examination is reviewed sequentially by two committees. The first, appointed by ECFMG, is composed of medical educators representing the 13 disciplines of the Day 1 and Day 2 components of FMGEMS. The ECFMG test committee is instructed to examine FMGEMS for overemphasis, under\u00ad emphasis or duplication in content, to check for scientific accuracy and clarity and otherwise to assure that the examination is acceptable for ECFMG certification. Any items removed based upon this review are replaced with items acceptable to the committee that are similar in all of the content and measurement characteristics noted above. The second committee, brought together by NBME, is made up of the chairmen of the thirteen NBME Basic Medical Sciences and Clinical Sciences Committees. This committee reviews FMGEMS for scientific accuracy and clarity, assures that the items are current and that the overall FMGEMS is representative of the longer NBME Part I and Part II examinations. Any items removed based upon this review are replaced with items acceptable to the committee that are similar in all of the content and measurement characteristics noted above. During the scoring phase of the FMGEMS testing process special steps are taken to assure the comparability of FMGEMS and the NBME examinations. Each item in FMGEMS is derived from the NBME pool of test items and is described by statistics which reflect the test item performance when used in NBME Part I and Part II examinations. Item difficulty data are used to calculate scores on FMGEMS that would be expected if a recent NBME Part I or Part II group had taken, in a single administration, the same combination of items that is on FMGEMS. Using these scores, the NBME Part I and Part II minimum pass scores are applied to the Day 1 and Day 2 parts of FMGEMS. For Day 1 of FMGEMS and NBME Part I, the minimum pass point typically requires that examinees answer between 55% and 60% of the Basic Science items correctly to pass. For Day 2 of FMGEMS and NBME Part II the percent correct range that corresponds to the minimum pass level is usually between 50% and 55%. This summary of FMGEMS test construction and scoring provides a general understanding of the steps taken to assure the comparability of the FMGEMS and NBME test and the collaborative efforts by ECFMG and NBME in FMGEMS construction. These procedures are intended to meet the requirements for ECFMG Certification and Public Law 94-484 in a fair and reasonable manner by using recognized test construction and scoring procedures.

William Harris, Director of the Bellevue Hospital Chest Service, and Professor of Clinical Medicine of the New York University Medical Center. I am grateful for this opportunity to address you briefly on behalf of ABMAC, the American Bureau for Medical Advancement in China. Dr. Richard Pierson, President of ABMAC, regretably could not come to Washington today, and asked me, as president elect, to present ABMAC's reaction to your important agenda, especially the part relating to the ~raining of foreign medical graduates, ABMAC was founded in NYC in 1937 as a voluntary effort to obtain much needed medical equipment and supplies in the U.S. and furnish these to the medically destitute Chinese military and civilian population during the SinoJapanese war, ABMAC fulfilled this purpose to a remarkable extent in light of the funds available at that time. In 1949, ABMAC removed its activities from mainland China, and relocated attention so as to help meet the enormous health needs in Taiwan. At first, assistance was principly in the form o~ money, equipment and supplies donated by interested and caring citizens in the U.S. However, after crisis conditions abated there and, working collaboratively over three decades with medical and nursing schools, teaching hospitals, and public health agencies in Taiwan, ABMAC has directed a major effort to assisting young physicians, nurses, medical scientists, public health workers, and other health-related professionals in Taiwan obtain appointments for appropriate post graduate training in the leading academic centers in the U.S. More than 400 ABMAC fellows have been trained in leading teaching hospitals, medical schools, and research laboratories throughout the United States. Most have spent a minimum of one year, and a few up to three years pursuing specialty and subspecialty training. Every one of these 400 trainees, with only two exceptions known, have returned to Taiwan on completing their training; today they are in positions of leadership in Taiwan's major.medical schools, hospitals, and official hea;1\u00b7th agencies. We in ABMAC take great pride in our accomplishments in this role; we believe that our long eXperience might assist you with the formidable task of constructd~Cig future plans for graduate medical training in the U.S. ' ... Please permit me to outline what we believe to be the essential components of this successful program. l. Candidates for American training are nominated for ABMAC fellowships by responsible officials and staff of a Taiwan sponsoring institution. 2. Both the candidate and sponsoring institution must define in writing the specific goals sought from the training experience in the United States. 3. The Taiwan sponsoring institution must assume total responsibility for salary and travel expense of the trainee. ABMAC acts as a dispersing agent for the Taiwan institution while the trainee is in the U.S. 4. As a pre-requisite to appointment as an ABMAC fellow, the candidate must be interviewed by an ABMAC executive in Taiwan in order to insure the candidate's serious purpose, commitment to learning, and adequate English skills. S. The candidate must be furnished a contract by the Taiwan sponsoring institution that guarantees an appropriate salaried post in that institution on completion of the training. The trainee must sign a contract agreeing to return to the sponsoring institution in Taiwan and occupy the post cited. An ABMAC official must certify the existence of both contracts. b. After the candidate is nominated as an ABMAC fellow, members of ABMAC's fellowship committee, and others on the Board of Directors, either directly or with the assistance of professional colleagues, seek openings for the ABMAC fellow in the leading U.S. medical institutions; the committee identifies and recommends the best possible available appointment to satisfy the fellow's specific goals. Our success rate has been high because U.S. teaching institutions can be assured that the ABMAC fellow has been rigorously evaluated, has adequate language skills, and will assuredly return to his own country, and contribute there the knowledge and skills acquired in the U.S. Many deans, clinical and basic science department and division heads, and research scientists in Taiwan's medical schools and teaching hospitals have had training in the U.S., many as ABMAC fellows. Today, they can arrange placement of young physicians and investigators in U.S. training programs directly. Thus, the academic institutions in Taiwan have less need for ABMAC's fellowship assistance than in the past. However, Taiwan National and Provincial governmental agencies are developing a network of health facilities throughout the island that will functionally connect provincial clinics and village hospitals with secondary and tertiary hosptials in the larger cities. Health officials there have identified a continuing need for ABM . 's assistance in providing suitable post graduate training opportunities i. \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7U.S. for the primary physicians, specialty nurses and other health wor~c aeeded for this country-wide expanded health program. American graduate . .ning is still needed in diverse fields of public health, preventive medicine, environaental pollution, industrial hygiene, geriatrics and many other health related areas. 188 For obvious reasons, ABMAC is especially interested in the work of your subcommittee on Foreign Medical Graduates; we are vitally concerned with the question \"Should the United States continue to provide specialty training for international exchange visitors who will return to their native countries to practice?\" We firmly endorse the conclusion 3.2 and 3.3 of this subcommittee indicating that there is a need to expand and modify educational opportunities in the U.S. for exchange visitor physicians to better meet health care needs of their home country, and that U.S. relations with foreign countries will be harmed if such educational opportunities are curtailed. We also agree and support the recommendations of this subcommittee cited under Items 3, 4 and 5. In light of the tremendous need for better health in underdeveloped countries throughout the world, a question every citizen should ponder is \"How can we best use American experience, skills, and competence to provide better heal th for less fortunate people in underdeveloped areas of the world?\" Possibly ABMAC's programs supporting better health in Taiwan during the past 38 years may contain elements that could model health alliances between the world's less developed countries and the U.S. Today, health conditions in some underdeveloped countries are comparable to circumstances in Taiwan in the 1950's. In that period, ABMAC helped Taiwan develop improved national programs of public health and medical care. Possibly ABMAC' s techniques and experience t.here could provide guidance to other voluntary and official agencies interested in improving health in underdeveloped countries today. We believe that such agencies could have similar impact in underdeveloped countries provided sufficient safeguards are established to insure that the American training acquired by their medical graduates is appropriate for a future role in the native country, and that the alternative of remaining in the United States after training does not exist. A beginning could be made by stricter requirements for training that is appropriate and not principally intern-type medical service provided by the FMG for an American medical institution. Our ability to educate FHG's appropriately might benefit by the development of an overseeing organization, such as a council, with responsibility and authority to match the skills needed in countries sending training candidates here with the programs best equipped for that specific purpose among American medical institutions. Based on a roster of cooperating U.S. medical institutions, a type of placement service for FMG's could be developed. A council, however, should be firmly attached to voluntary and academic institutions, as well as government agencies. Although enforcement processes are required for effective function of such a council, we believe that fellowship programs should be operated primarily by academic institutions and voluntary agencies, such as ABMAC. In order to maintain the flexibility necessary for such a program, we believe it essential that a quota limiting the total complement of physicians training in the U.S. must be avoided. One would hope that improved organization overall, might reestablish the original intent of US based FHG training programs, that is the improvement of health and quality of human life worldwide. May I thank you, Hr. Chair~an, for this opportunity to acquaint you with the American Bureau for Medical Advancement in China, and to describe our past and present role in training Chinese post graduate students in the United States. 189 INTERAMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS \"Apret6n de Manos Curativas\" Building an Interamerican Community of Physicians November 1987 J 91 INTERAMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS Background Information Purpose The Interamerican College of Physicians and Surgeons(ICPS) is a non-profit, tax-exempt, nongovernmental organization incorporated in the District of Columbia as an educational, charitable, medical corporation. It is governed by an eight-member Board of Regents, presided over by a chairman. Articles of Incorporation were filed on Februrary 23, 1979. !CPS was created to promote greater communication and cooperation among Hispanic physicians practicing in the U.S. and Latin America. It is a vehicle that foments a professional network among the physicians of the Americas and Spain and serves to develop and stimulate friendship and cooperation among physicians throughout the Americas by harnessing their talents, resources, and goodwill for the betterment of society. Objectives The objectives of the Interamerican College of Physicians and Surgeons are far-reaching in scope: To increase understanding and medical communication in its broadest sense among the physicians of the Americas To focus developing health resources to meet the functional and educational needs of ICPS Fellows and physicians in general To develop a network of communication reaching medical schools, medical societies, governmental agencies, and individual physicians, so as to enrich and enhance health care, economic growth and cooperation throughout the Americas To strengthen new cooperative health ventures and stimulate new interest in programs that_pre already in existence Publications The official publication of the College is MEDICO Interamericano magazine. It is the only Spanish-language medical journal in the u.s., and is distributed monthly, free of charge, to over 25,000 Hispanic physicians residing in the U. s and Puerto Rico. In September of 1987, ICPS launched Buena Salud, a health-oriented magazine in Spanish, aimed at the general Hispanic audience of the U.S. It is filling a void in the area of health information available to patients in Spanish. 192 Fellowships Fellowships in the College are available to distinguished physicians practicing in the United States, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Spain. Some distinguished College Fellows include: Severo Ochoa, M.D., Nobel Prize in Medicine (1959); Cesar Milstein, M.D., Nobel Prize in Medicine (1984); Jaime Lusinchi, M.D., President of the Republic of Venezuela; Major General Enrique Mendez, Jr., M.D., Dean of the School of Medicine, Ponce, Puerto Rico. 11APRETON DE MANOS CURATIVAS\" Purpose In its efforts to build a bridge of technical knowledge and human understanding, in September of 1985, the Interamerican College of Physicians and Surgeons (ICPS), in cooperation with the Latin American Bureau of the Agency for International Development (AID), created a physician-to-physician exchange program throughout the inter-American medical community, \"Apreton de Manos Curativas11 The purpose of the ICPS/USAID Cooperative Agreement is to design and implement a medical technology exchange program between members of ICPS practicing primary care medicine in the U.S. and physicians in South America, Central America, the Caribbean and Mexico. ICPS is uniquely prepared to facilitate technical training exchanges both in the U.S. and in Latin America because its membership is characterized by bilingual individuals who are aware of the culture, customs and behavior of the inhabitants of the Americas. Many ICPS members are directly involved in the training of medical students and the delivery of primary care services to underserved populations in the U.S. This is why some of the training for the exchange physicians takes place in the states with the largest Hispanic populations. ICPS views the Physician Exchange Program as an opportunity to develop health care leadership in the U.S. and in the LAC/countries as a hemispheric resource. Funding The Agency for International Development gave funding to ICPS, to develop and implement a four year (1985 -1989) pilot physicians exchange program called, 11Apret6n de Manos Curativas.11 193 Costs Covered by Scholarship The short-term scholarships offered include the following: 1. Round Trip Airfare (coach) from country of origin 2. Travel Within the U.S. and Puerto Rico to cities involved in the training plan 3. Per Diem/Monthly Allowance to cover housing accomodations, food, in-city transportation and incidentals. 4. Book Allowance: for 6 months of training, participant will receive $65 per month for books. If training is less than 6 months, participant will receive $60 total for books 5. Shipment of Books: books will be shipped to the trainee's home country at the end of his/her training period, maximum of 60 lbs. 6. Health Insurance and. Accident Coverage: $40 per month for the duration of the training. Medical exam required prior to acceptance. No previously existing medical conditions will be covered. Emergency dental care is covered. 7. ICPS Membership: As part of the follow-up, the cost of ICPS professional membership will be paid for the first year following the training Certificates Each participant will receive a certificate upon completion of the training and a letter of certification from ICPS How to Apply for an ICPS/USAID Scholarship Physicians in Latin America, interested in applying for a scholarship, may do so by contacting the AID Mission\u00b7 at the American Embassy in their country Phase I Phase I of the project is designed to bring exchange physicians from Latin America to train in the U.S.(from one to six months), and includes the following activities: o The placement of LAC/Physicians with Spanish-speaking primary care practitioners in rural and urban areas, to observe and participate, where possible, in the delivery of medical services. 194 o The design and conduct of informal/formal structured training programs supervised by ICPS physician preceptors. Both clinical and non-clinical skills are incorporated into the preceptorship program which include: Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Family Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Opthamology, Rehabilitation Medicine, Hospital Administration and Public Health. o Placement of physicians in innovative service delivery environments wherever possible. o ICPS serves USAID Mission requests for information and guidance on clinical training in the United States. During its first year (1986) 11Apret6n de Manos Curativas\" brought 10 trainees from the following countries: Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Ecuador. The specialties of the exchange physicians were: Hospital Administration, Pediatrics, Public Health Administration, HMO Management Observation/Emergency Medical Systems, Rehabilitation Medicine. In 1987, the project brought 12 Latin American physicians. The first group of 8 arrived on June 28th, and the second group of 4 on October 18th. The countries receiving scholarships were: Honduras, Costa Rica, Bolivia, and Guatemala (for the first group) and Colombia and El Salvador (for the second group). The specialties of the first group were: Pediatrics, Family Medicine, OB-GYN, Emergency Medicine and Hospital Administration. The specialties of the second group were Emergency Medicine, Traumatology and Hospital Administration. Phase II Phase II of the project sends U.S. physicians (mostly Hispanic) to Latin America and the Caribbean to provide short-term technical assistance. The request for this type of assistance must come from the AID Mission at the American Embassy in the country in question. In 1987, the Salvadoran Rehabilitation Institute requested technical assistance from the AID Mission in El Salvador. 11Apret6n de Manos Curativas11 was asked to send two Hispanic physicians (one with a background in Hospital Administration, and the other, an orthopedic surgeon with a background in physiatry and rehabilitation) as part of a four-man team, to do a comprehensive evaluation of the Center for Locomotor Devices, in terms of medical services, protheses, physical therapy, occupational therapy and administration of the center. 195 Volunteer ism 11Apret6n de Manos curativas\" is made possible through the volunteer efforts of a network of Spanish-speaking physicians throughout the United states and Puerto Rico. These preceptors freely share their time, knowledge and experience with the exchange physicians so that when these trainees return home they can translate/adapt the knowledge and experience that they have gained during their training in the United States and apply it to their national/local needs. Preceptors aid in the progress of Latin America, in the health field, with their contribution. For many Hispanic physicians, living in the U.S., this project offers an opportunity to contribute, in a personal way, to the growth and development of the Latin American health care delivery system.

International medical education exch~nge is a powerful instrument for fostering international harmony. The current discussions concerning the appropriate method of funding graduate medical education should not be allowed to diminish or interfere with the use of graduate medical education as a valuable instrument for international medical exchange. Although there is much room for improvement in graduate medical education, its continued participation in the U.S. effort to achieve international understanding should be appreciated and supported. The role which GME has played in the U.S. health care system is complicated and extends far beyond medical education to the areas of medical service delivery and international medical exchange. The role foreign medical graduates have been asked to play in GME has a history which is closely linked to domestic physician manpower needs. To illustrate this pattern of foreign medical graduate utilization we need only review the driving forces responsible for the legislation and regulation associated with this group of health professionals. \u00b7 DATE LEGISLATION, REGULATIONS, ISSUES, 1948 Smith Mundt Act The U.S. 1946-1950 Limited availability of undergraduate positions 1950-1951 1956 Expanding residency positions to accomodate returning vets, associated with construction of new hospitals (Hill Burton Act) Smith Mundt Act Amended requiring 199 INTENTION, PROBLEMS Establish true Exchange Active recruitment of FMGs congress expected 500 entrants per year 2000 exchange physician visitors entered Active conversion of visa status a 2 year return home prior to immigrant visa consideration 1959 state Department limits residency loosely enforced training to 5 years for exchange visitors 1953-1963 3,636 waivers permitting conversion were granted 1958 First ECFMG exam 1965 1976 Immigration Act of 1952 was amended Hospital-based care expanded via insurance (Medicare, Blues) PL. 94-484 Title VI of Health Profession Educational Assistance Act of 1976 physician preference categories established Limitation on use of J visa requiring: return home assurance total 2 year study period VQE Intention -limit entry, ensure return home, accomodate U.S. graduates 1976-1980 Substantial Disruption to allow phasing out of FMGs in dependent hospital (Legislative Cronology) As this history clearly shows foreign medical graduate participation in GME has been an international affair which has served both the U.S. medical health care delivery system as well . as foreign physicians in ways which deviated from the original intention of the Smith Mundt Act. The current discussion cannot divorce itself from this history. The historic utilization of exchange visitor programs for preferential entry to immigrant status, though it was actively promoted by the U.S. and served U.S. needs, was an unfortunate misdirection of a program created to 200 promote international sharing of medical knowledge and expertise. The ICPS has been active in the area of international medical exchange and supports the utilization of GME in a modified form as an _instrument of international policy. It proposes---an\u00b7 alfirnative, expanded international medical education and service exchange model. The proposed modifications include: short-term preceptorship program; elimination of exam barriers to entry for selected accomplished clinicians to participate in U.S. GMEi and the formation of a truly international organ of peace, an International Health Service Corps. The ICPS position can be summarized as follows: ISSUE: Should the u.s. continue to use GME for international medical education exchange? POSITION l: THE CURRENT GME SYSTEM SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE USED FOR POSTGRADUATE EDUCATION OF EXCHANGE VISITOR PHYSICIANS. THE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO PROVIDE RELEVANT, TAILORED POSTGRADUATE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES FOR EXCHANGE VISITOR PHYSICIANS WITH EMPHASIS ON SATISFYING HOME COUNTRY NEEDS. RATIONALE: We feel that the continued use of graduate medical education positions for international medical education exchange is appropriate however, important modifications would be required to make these experiences. more relevant to the exchange visitor physician. One of. the major, and more significant, criticisms of the continued use of GME for exchange physician education has been that the skills acquired in the high-technology tertiary heal th care center of the u. s. cannot be easily transferred to the exchange physician's\u00b7 home setting. If GME continues its traditional emphasis on the development of nonprimary care expertise, the above argument is valid and difficult to counter. GME programs in the U.S. have recently, been plaC':i.ng greater emphasis on primary and ambulatory care. The importance of this neglected area has been recognized by family medicine, general internal medicine and general pediatrics. These disciplines have made major curricular changes in these areas. This new direction in GME makes these programs more relevant to the needs of exchange visitors who will be 2 '1 J returning to the home country to practice primary care. The current increasing emphasis on abulatory care is a direct by-product of the appreciation of the importance of primary care training. Although these educational innovations in primary care and ambulatory care may make our GME system more meaningful and relevant to exchange visitor physicians who may enter from less developed countries, there is still a need for greater flexibility within residency programs. Residency programs should be programed to tailor existing educational experiences to meet the specific needs of an individual exchange visitor physicians and the needs of their home countries. ISSUE: Should future exchange visitor physician training be limited to medical school affiliated programs? POSITION 2: EXCHANGE VISITOR EDUCATION EXPERIENCES SHOULD NOT BE CONFINED TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AFFILIATED PROGRAMS. OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD INCLUDE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY PRIVATE ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS UTILIZING STRUCTURED PRECEPTORSHIP EXPERIENCES. RATIONALE: Again the .lessons of history tell us that medical schools have traditionally concentrated on expanding the body of knowledge in medicine and have established the reputation of being centers of excellence which have attracted more applicants than they could accomodate. This system offers many valuable experiences for exchange visitors and should continue to participate in this international exchange activity. There are, however, many advantages to considering alternate models which, though not linked to medical schools, can offer educational flexibility and learning opportunities which are currently not being provided in the high-tech medical school controlled programs. Exchange visitor physicians can often have a more meaningful educational experience in the ambulatory sector at the side of a seasoned professional mentor. In this setting they can observe the expert management of heal th care problems within the limitations found in the nontertiary setting. They can learn how practitioners avail themselves of community resources in the management of their more complicated cases. This type of training is more meaningful because it is more applicable and transferable than the intense exposure to organ-transplant surgery, nuclear medicine or other sophisticated high-tech marvels which are not available in the homeland. 202 ISSUE: Should the U.S. health care system participate in a global medical service system? POSITION 3: THE U.S. SHOULD CONSIDER THE ORGANIZATION OF A \"TRUE\" INTERNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS WHICH WOULD BE COMPOSED MAINLY OF u.s.-TRAINED EXCHANGE VISITOR PHYSICIANS. RATIONALE: The U.S., a recognized economic and political world leader, should also be the nation that leads the world to a new and exciting program of mutual assistance. We propose that the U.S. consider establishing a \"true\" International Heal th Service Corps. This global health corps could be composed primarily of exchange visitor physicians trained in the U.S. medical care system. The experience would allow them to share their American training with the developing nations. This would make the exchange visitor program more responsive to global health care service and educational needs. ISSUE: Is a screening exam appropriate and necessary for exchange visitors who are accomplished clinicians in order for them to participate in GME? POSITION 4: THE CLINICAL SCREENING EXAM FOR EXCHANGE VISITOR PHYSICIANS SHOULD BE A TRUE TEST OF CLINICAL COMPETENCE. RATIONALE: While the ICPS recognizes the need for some screening process which would ensure the American public is receiving health care at the hands of competent, well-prepared health professionals, it is not clear that the current process solely serves that purpose. Qualified,' accomplished clinicians are often excluded from participation in U. s. graduate medical education because of certain current illogical regulatio~s. While the clinical science portion of the current FMGEMS exam is an appropriate measure of \u00b7clinical competence, the basic science portion is not a valid measure of clinical decision-making expertise. Although we acknowledge the value of understanding basic scientific principles such as the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway and Krebs cycle, and their roles in carbohydrate metabolism, recall of the details of 203 these biochemical pathways is not necessary for high-quality management of a comatose diabetic patient. Al though basic sciences form the foundation of clinical practice, rarely do pratitioners need to recall such concepts in order to manage the problems which they encounter. Since the basic science portion of the exam does not truly measure clinical competence, it serves primarily as a barrier to the entry of older accomplished clinicians who wish to avail themselves of U.S. GME in order to improve their own practice and to return to their home and share their new knowledge with their countrymen. In addition to the above arguments against the screening value of the basic science portion of the exam, there is also another important argument which questions the educational soundness of requiring applicants to GME, who supposedly come from countries which do not offer the high standard of medical training which is available in the U.S., to demonstrate that they have attained the same level of competency as graduates of U.S. medical schools. ISSUE: Who should finance physicians' exchange programs ? POSITION 5: THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT SHOULD FINANCE EXCHANGE PROGRAMS FOR PRACTICING PHYSICIANS FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO STUDY IN THE U.S. SINCE THESE PROGRAMS ARE AN ARM OF U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND SERVE TO REINFORCE U.S. POLICY OBJECTIVES AT HOME AND ABROAD. RATIONALE: There are several reasons the U.S. Government should lead the way in financing physicians exchange programs between the U.S. and foreign countries, particularly in the developing world. Since the passage of Public Law 94-484 (1976), which restricted access of physicians from foreign countries to study in the U.S. Some have perceived the U.S. attitude as disinterest in sharing the advances of modern medicine. Others perceive it as a lack of commitment to the future of international exchange of medical technology. In contrast, the soviet Union and Eastern Bloc nations have increased their exchange and scholarship programs for foreign .medical students dramatically in the last decade. The influence of the United states in the training of health care professionals is relatively small today compared to that of the Soviet Union. The Department of State, including the Agency for International Development and USIA, while promoting other educational exchange programs, have not fully taken into 204 consideration, the important role that U.S.-trained physicians play in in the foreign and national policy making in their own countries. Many of them hold leadership positions, and promote the use of U.S. technology, which enhances the commercial relations between the U.S. and their countries. They promote international collaboration between their U.S. training site/sponsor and their country, both in scholarly persuits and by encouraging joint research. The role of the returning physician is significant and of great importance to the promotion of U.S. foreign policy. Activities which enhance the image of the U.S. and promote U.S. national interest should be supported by the Department of State. 205 TESTIMONY OF MIRIAM F. JACOBS FOR THE ACTION COMMITTEE FOR FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION ON NOVEMBER 19, 1987 207 TESTIMONY TO BE GIVEN BEFORE SUB-COMMITTEE on FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES by MIRIAM JACOBS OF THE ACTION COMMITTEE for FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES I would like to thank the members of the Committee for allowing me the opportunity to present the views of the Action Committee for Foreign Medical Graduates fo~ your consideration. We, as an organization, have been very active in bringing the legitimate concerns of foreign medical graduates in the United States to the attention of organized medicine and to local legislative leaders, and we appreciate the opportunity to do the same today. I am going to specifically address the draft conclu- sions/recommendations which are the subject of the Committee's deliberation. I will take these issues '\"'one at a time, but, only discuss those points which we feel are of major concern to the foreign medical graduate community in the United States. Regarding Issue 1, we feel, in agreement, with Conclusion 1.1. The exclusion of foreign medical graduates (FMG's) from residency training will have ' an adverse affect on current hospital services. We do not feel that alternative service providers will provide the same quality of service as foreign medical graduate resiclents in approved training programs. 208 Consequently, we do not agree on any federally mandated substitu- tion or elimination of foreign medical graduate programs. In particular, we take issue with Recommendation 1.A.a. of the first draft. We feel that there is no reason for a mandated 90% residency level of LCME or AOA approved graduates in any quali- fied training programs. Training programs are approved by the residency review committees of the various specialty boards. These programs are under the direction of local program directors who evaluate applications and interview potential residents on a personal basis. To substitute a blanket percentage quota for the considered judgment of these experienced program directors is to institute a heavy-handed federal control where none is needed. The competition for residency positions is intense and foreign medical graduates are at a severe disadvantage. In accordance with Conclusion 3-2.4, we agree that the competition for avail- able positions being very high, only the most highly qualified residents are selected \"irrespective of citizenship or nation- ality\". Consequently, we feel that market forces and private selection criteria are sufficient to provide quality residents in approved residency programs. Therefore, our recommendation is that a program approved by the Residency Review Committee of the I specialty concerned should be funded regardless of the portion of American or foreign-trained physicians assuming residency positions therein. If the program does not attract sufficient American graduates, or the pass rates of the board examinations are too low, then, these issues are for the Residency Review Committee of the specialty to evaluate, and not for the federal 209 government to use as an excuse for a back door attempt at regulation of foreign medical graduates. Therefore, we feel that there is no need for any percentage quota in evaluating a training program for funding. If the program is approved, then it snould be funded. If the program is inadequate or substandard, then it should not be approved. With regard to Issue 2' we are in agreement with Conclusion 2. 1. We feel that graduates of foreign medical schools should not be distinguished by the fact of their medical school gradua- ti on for purposes of attaining graduate medical education from any other graduate of any other medical school, including the United States medical schools. The criteria for entry into graduate medical education training programs should be individual qualification, meeting appropriate examination standards and satisfying program directors of personal motivation, dedication and ability. The issue of medical school locations should only be one factor in this evaluation process. As I mentioned before, foreign medical graduates enter this competition at a distinct disadvantage. There has been a loni-standing institutional prejudice in the United States against foreign medical graduates which has been supported by the United States Government. There is no compelling State interest for the .continuation of this discrimination fostered by the U.S. Government policies when private, professional groups are capable of evaluating and managing this problem unaided. Evidence of the adverse impact on patient care because of inferior training or substandard 210 performance of foreign medical graduates is lacking. As a matter of fact, studies of the incidences of medical malpractice claims show it to be specialties and program program based upon the to the contrary. The fact is that many directors prejudge the quality of a number of foreign medical graduates in the program. The directors of medical education are constantly reminded and called upon to account for the number of foreign medical graduates in their programs. They are told that their programs will be viewed in a better light if the number of FMG's are reduced. It seems to us self-evident that it is time to evaluate individual physicians on the basis of iridividual merit and not on the basis of the country of their education. There\u00ad fore, we are in agreement with Recommendation A.2.A. under Issue 2. In addition, we agree with Recommendation B.2.B. that United States citizens should receive preferential treatment with regard to access to \u00b7graduate medical edu.cation than is given foreign nationals who intend to immigrate to the United States. This is not to say that foreign physicians who wish to avail themselves of the excellent training in the United States and who intend and agree to return to their home countries, should not be made exceptions to the rule. We do not feel that they should be included in any quota system of foreign medical graduates and in fact are opposed to the imposition of any quota system. However, in the a,lternative, if a quota system is imposed, we feel that alien physicians who are in the United States for training only, should not be part of the quota, but should be ~~9_~e_t:_ions to the quota. Consequently, we are in 211 general agreement with Issue 3 and its conclusions and recommend\u00ad ations. With regard to Issue 4, we agree with Conclusion 4.1. We are on record for several years in support of the introduction of EQUALITY IN TESTING, as our position is that everyone seeking to practice medicine or apply for postgraduate medical education in the United States should be held to the same high standard. There should be one examination for everyone regardless of where the medical education this should not be held ~P was received. The implementation of until 1989 in this day and age of computerization, and especially when there are two existing examinations to choose from. the We are in complete agreement with Federal Government should not Recommendation 4.A, that attempt to add further requirements for FMG's for entry into graduate medical education programs as the private sector has moved responsibly into this area. While we do not agree with all of the actions taken by organized medicine, we feel that that is the proper forum for this debate and that is the correct arena for professional evaluation and review of medical training programs which are approved by appropriate professional review agencies. The authority to approve these programs for funding should be delegated by the agency to these review organizations in the private sector. With regard to issue 5, we agree that this is a difficult and extremely complicated situation. It is probably impossible 212 for the United States to provide recognition and accreditation for medical education outside of its jurisdiction. Nevertheless, it is probably an issue which should be left to the discretion of the States. If the States, who are basically responsible for regulating medical practice within their jurisdiction have determined that certain medical schools are worthy of approval for training programs or other operations within their jurisdic\u00ad tion, then the Federal Government should defer to the States' discretion in this area. This is supported not only by active precedent as the Federal Government has no licensing arrangement in any of the States, this being left solely to the discretion of the States. This is also supported by any rational interpretation of the 10th Ammendment to the United States Constitution. I wish again to thank the Committee for allowing me the opportunity to present these views for your consideration. The bottom line consensus that I wish to leave you with is that the Action Committee for Foreign Medical Graduates feels that the imposition of federal control into graduate medical education is unwarranted, unwise and without a rational basis. These programs are now reviewed very st~ictly by the professional residency reviBw committees and the Federal Government should continue its delegation to these organizations to review programs for approv\u00ad al. If programs so reviewed are approved, then they should 213 be funded. Applicants for these programs should be selected by local program directors and no quota should be mandated by the Federal Government. Thank you very much. Signed: Miriam F.

NORTH AMERICAN STUDENTS' ASSOCIATION OF THE UNIVERSIDAD AUTONOMA DE GUADALAJARA BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION Good afternoon Mr. Chairman and members of the Council thank you for this opportunity to testify. I am Kevin Donovan, attorney for the North American Students' Association (NASA) of the Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara (UAG). NASA's members are U.S. citizens studying at the medical school of the Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara, in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. NASA stands by the principle that each individual should be measured on the basis of merit. NASA, therefore, heartily supports the Council's Principles and the three Subcommittees' Conclusions and Recommendations adopted at the Council's meeting on October 6, 1987. These documents reflect a decision to focus on merit and public health and safety, rather than the false issues of oversupply and protection of physician incomes. NASA praises the proposals of the Subcommittee on Foreign Medical Graduates which reflect concern with public health and fairness and the quality, not quantity, of 215 physicians. The Subcommittee clearly states that there should be.no discrimination against qualified applicants to Graduate Medical Education (GME) based on medical school attended, and that graduates of U.S. schools are not automatically guaranteed a GME position. Some in U.S. medicine state that only graduates of U.S. medical schools should be permitted into GME because graduates of foreign medical schools do not have adequate medical knowledge. They base their argument on overall pass rates on questionable tests. These individuals and groups leave the realm of logic and reveal their true objectives, however, when they move to exclude not only graduates of suspect medical schools and those who cannot pass tests, but also graduates of established, legitimate medical schools, such as the UAG, that offer quality training, whose graduates have passed the tests and whose graduates have been licensed for decades by every medical board in the U.S. These individuals and groups ignore t~e published studies which show that foreign medical graduates and U.S. medical graduates provide equivalent health care. They also ignore the fact that 14% of faculty at U.S. medical schools are foreign medical graduates. The Subconunittee notes that there have been questions raised about the equivalence of testing of U.S. and foreign graduates. There certainly are questions. NASA asserts that the two testing systems, one exclusively for graduates of U.S. and Canadian schools and the other for graduates of all other schools has only one purpose: discrimination. NASA 216 has never heard any valid, scientific reason why the testing entity for medicine in the U.S., the NBME, refuses to per~it graduates of foreign medical schools to take the same test of medical knowledge as d~ graduates of U.S. schools. NASA understands that at this session there may be some announcement of the results of a study commissioned by the NBME or the ECFMG to determine the equivalence of the NBME and the FMGEMS. Since these organizations comm.issioned the study, NASA will be shocked beyond belief if the results say other than what the NBME and ECFMG have claimed all along, namely that the two tests are totally equivalent. If the testing goal of the NBME is, as it claims, to measure equivalence of medical knowledge of all applicants, it is a most unorthodox and unscientific method to produce two different examinations to measure comparability of skills. Every other profession fairly and correctly uses one test to measure competence. Assuming that the two tests are equivalent still begs the question: why are two different tests needed to test physicians who will be treating the same population? NASA believes that any system that is truly dedicated to assuring equal quality of applicants will use one test. A dual testing system certainly gives the appearance of discrimination. NASA believes ~hat the present testing system is discriminatory, and that the FMGEMS is a harder test than the NBME. I had a conversation with a physician member of a state licensing board who is a prominent faculty 217 member at a major U.S. medical school. He has seen and administered the NBME and FMGEMS. He told me it is obvious that the two tests have two different purposes: the NBME is designed for people to pass, the FMGEMS is designed for people to fail. His comments make sense. When students at UAG could take NBME I for transfer pGrposes, their pass rates were approaching those of U.S. students. Now that_ UAG students are taking FMGEMS I, which is supposedly the equivalent of NBME I, their pass rate is far lower, yet the pass rates of U.S. students on NBME ~ have remained the same. NASA challenges the NBME and the ECFMG to permit all applicants to take one test at the next sitting, either the NBME or the FMGEMS. NASA predicts that if the NBME is chosen, foreign student pass rates will rise; if FMGEMS is chosen, U.S. student pass rates will drop. NASA petitions this Council to recommend the fair way, the scientifically honest way, the non-discriminatory way, the way chosen by all other professions to measure comparability of knowledge: one test for all. NASA supports the Council's Principle Number 1, which states that the primary concern of the Council must be assured access to quality_ health care, and that concerns for the well-being of the health professions must be secondary. NASA congratulat~s the Council on this clear assertion of dedication to public health. COGME Principles number 2 and 8 also demonstrate the Council's dedication to health care concerns. Principle 2 addresses the need to assure physician coverage in rural and 218 urban physician shortage areas. Principle 8 notes that health care needs will change based on demographics and disease patterns such as AIDS. Both of these principles are reflected in the recommendations of the Subcommittee on Physician Manpower, namely that no attempts should be made to limit numbers of physicians since there are currently many medically underserved areas in this country, and that the impact of AIDS and other as yet unknown diseases may turn any perceived short-term surplus of physicians into a critical shortage. Some in the medical community are calling for controls on numbers of physicians and on graduates of foreign medical schools; these persons and organizations either disregard the many federally-designated health care shortage areas, or they have concluded that sacrificing the health care of others is a fair trade-off in their quest to preserve their high incomes. NASA congratulates the Subcommittee and Council for ignoring these pressures to date and urges you to continue to resist the heavy lobbying pressure these groups will exert to protect their self-interests. NASA supports the recommendation of the Subcommittee on Graduate Medical Education Programs and Financing which states that changes in GME financing should be undertaken in an evolutionary manner to avoid the adverse results that would result from sudden implementation. Areas that depend on GME medical services ha~e evolved over time, and the relationships are too complex to be severed abruptly without causing serious adverse effects to the health care of those 219 least able to afford the changes. The Subcommitee did not make any recommendations on GME financing for foreign medical graduates because it had not yet received the report of the Subcommittee on Foreign Medical Graduates. NASA expects that any financing recommendations will logically follow the Foreign Medical Graduate Subcommittee's emphasis on merit selection rather than discrimination based on medical school attended. I have given to staff a copy of my oral and written testimony to the Subcommittee on Foreign Medical Graduates on October 5, 1987, for its inclusion in the record; I will be pleased to supply it to individual members on request. Thank you for your attention. I will attempt to answer your questions. 220 NOVEMBER 19, 1987 TESTIMONY OF RICHARD RICHARDS ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSIDAD AUTONOMA DE GUADALAJARA BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION I. INTRODUCTION Good morning, Mr. Chairman and members of the committee. My name is Richard Richards. I am the Legislative Counsel for the Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara. I would first like to thank you for the opportunity to testify before the full Council on Graduate Medical Education. Before proceeding, I would like to express my appreciation to the, Subcommittee on Foreign Medical Graduates for the professional manner in which the subcommittee conducted its hearings. I would further like to commend its Chairman, Dr. Whitcomb, for his leadership of the subcommittee and its members Drs. Mitchell, Peterson, Rodriguez and Mr. Groner and Ms. Apte for their diligence, demonstrated by their active participation. I was also impressed with the fairness of the subcommittee. Each of us had an opportunity to state our positions; the committee listened intently; good questions were asked; and I felt that all of the participants were treated fairly and given ample opportunity to present their case, for which the University is grateful. In 1985 when the Congressional conferees on the Budget Reconciliation Act directed the creation of this Council, much trepidation spread throughout both the American and foreign medical education community. I must say, after reviewing the recommendations of the Subcommittee on Foreign M~dical Graduates, that these fears have been laid to rest. We are pleased with the proposed COGME principles recommended by the Subcommittee, and look forward to a more in-depth discussion concerning some of said principles. We further pledge our active participation in the Council activities during its mandated tenure of existence. 221 The UAG supports the subcommittee resolution to issue #2, specifically that there should be no distinction between graduates of U.S. and foreign schools simply on the basis of the school attended. The standards to insure quality care in our communities must be placed on the qualifications of the individual. But these qualifications must be tested equally and uniformly. We further support the resolution to issue #3, specifically that any clinical test required for entrance to graduate medical education (GME) be applied to all applicants regardless of the geographical source of their education. II. THE NATURE AND BACKGROUND OF THE UNIVERSIDAD AUTONOMA DE GUADALAJARA First, I would like to briefly explain the Universidad Autonoma de Guadalajara (UAG), for it is truly unique amongst academic institutions. UAG is the oldest and largest private university in Mexico. Since its beginning, the institution has striven to overcome all obstacles to reach one goal, the successful operation of a co-educational, non-religious and non-profit university. At present, the University offers doctoral programs in several fields, and twelve masters degree programs. They train, among other professions, attorneys, engineers, architects, psychologists, educators, public administrators, linguists, and of course, physicians. The UAG is a major University. To that end the International Association of University Presidents recently elected UAG President Dr. Luis Garibay as their president, an exceptional honor to him and the University. The National Council of Science and Technology of Mexico has described the UAG as being \"the most effective program with the finest teaching staff in the entire country.\" To give you some idea of its size, UAG has a teaching staff of 1,500 faculty members, campuses of nearly 3,000 acres distributed over 16 sites, with a current enrollment of over 20,000 students. 222 UAG has graduated approximately 38,000 students from its inception, of which approximately 7,500 have been American citizens. The school was founded in 1935, making it now over 50 years old. It has a long and proud history. Let me make it abundantly clear. The UAG is not an academic institution created by Americans for Americans outside the boundaries of the U.S. rt was not created with the intention of usurping American medical educational institutions. Certainly, it is an alternative for U.S. students who do not, for various reasons, obtain admission to U.S. medical schools. To date UAG is approved in all states requiring preapproval inspections for the performance of clinical clerkships and is the only Foreign Medical School to be fully approved by the Education Department of the State of New York for clinical clerkships: This status is extremely difficult to obtain and maintain because of the high standards required by the state of New York. UAG graduates are actively sought in many U.S. hospitals. In fact, last year over 80% of the applicants for resident matching received their notch. This statistic is commensurate with U.S. medical schools. This has been a brief overview of UAG, but graphic evidence attesting to the magnitude of the University and its programs. III. THE UAG'S COMMITMENT TO ITS STUDENTS UAG is proud of its institution, its students and its faculty. Its primary commitment to its students is to provide a good medical education, and secondly, to do all within its power to insure its students, once they have graduated, that there will be an opportunity to practice medicine throughout the world, including the United States, and to assist the students in combating discriminatory practices of whatever nature and wherever they may be found. 223 We on behalf of UAG have worked with Congress to initiate and enact laws that preclude such discrimination. It was UAG who joined the medical care community when the proposal was made in Congress to deny Medicare reimbursement to teaching hospitals for FMG residencies. Our efforts further extended to the proposal for elimination of Guaranteed Student Loans to U.S. FMG's attending foreign medical schools. Through the efforts of UAG, the law now only precludes loans to students who attend schools which do not have a student population of at least 60% country nationals or a 50% pass rate on FMGEMS, thus protecting legitimate medical schools, but denying protection to so-called \"diploma mills.\" These efforts have not been limited to the Congress. UAG maintains an active presence in many state legislatures, including New York, New Jersey, California and Pennsylvania. At present New York's legislature is debating the issue of utilizing one single testing for licensure in New York State. Last year during its annual meeting the CME of the AMA directed the EFMG and the NBME to examine the possibility of utilizing one exam. We wholeheartedly support uniform testing and urge your committee to embrace this concept and include it in your recommendations. To do so would be a major step forward to insure uniform high quality of the physicians in our hospitals. In closing, I would again like to thank the Chairman, the Council and particularly the Subcommittee on Foreign Medical Graduates for their work and would like to reiterate our pledge to work with you now and in the future to insure the best possible medical care for the people of our nation. Thank you. 224 Presentation To The Council on Graduate Medical Education By James E. Cassidy, B.A., D.M.D., M.P.H., Dr. P.H. President, Ross University 225 My name is James Cassidy. I am president of Ross University which numbers among its educational institutions, a School of Veterinary Medicine, an Information Systems Institute, and a School of Medicine. I am here today, of course, to discuss matters that may impact on our School of Medicine, its students, and its graduates. As I am sure all persons attending this hearing have done, I read with great interest the Council's Recommended COGME Principles, and the Preliminary Recommendations and Conclusions of the Council's three subcommittees. Speaking on behalf of the hundreds of men and women, many of them American citizens, who matriculate at our School of Medicine, much of what has come out of the diliberations of the Council and its subcommittees, we find, with the exception of several issues I will raise, that the recommendations and conclusions made so far are valid and equitable. the Federal Register, I learned that \"Issues Relating to Foreign Medical graduates\" is one of the matters tt:ie Council was directed to consider. I have no knowledge, however, of why the subcommittee on FMG's chose to interpret that. directive as requiring that its first order of business be to consider what the effect on the availability of hospital based services would be if FMG's were to be removed from hospital training. 226 The Subcommittee did identify a number of seriously negative effects such action would have, especially if it were enacted abruptly. However, the Subcommittee has not as yet, at least, recommended or concluded that such an action should not be taken. In consideration of several related matters, it follows logically should be made by the Council. The Council has stated that, \"the primary concern of the Council must be the health of the American people\". Although there is an additional major reason that I will mention for not removing FMG's from hospital training, I see no way, in a time when the Federal\u00b7 and State governments are in difficult f inan ci al straits, to find funding for replacement of FMG residents. The cost would be prohibitive, which leads therefore to the conclusion that to provide health care for large segments of the American people, continuing the appointment of FMG's to residency training is the only feasible course of action -at least for the foreseeable future. Related to this matter is the report given to the Council at its third meeting by Dr. Vaneslow. In his report on visits he and Mr. Schwab made to various federal officials, Dr. Vaneslow stated that in his view, \"Congress was willing to consider proposals to restrict FMG's, but was deeply worried about access of the poor to health care, whether FMG's should be excluded from serice positions, and equitable treatment of American citizens, wherever they had received their medical education\". 227 In consideration of the current acute need for fiscal restraint, Congress' concern about access of the poor to health care substantively reenforces the rationale for recommending that FMG's not be removed from hospital training. Such a recommendation would support principle number 6 of the Council, concerned as it is with effects on total health care costs. Further, the concern for equitale treatment of all American citizens, wherever they had received their medical education must be noted. If there is a legal or rational basis for considering where an American citizen took his or her medical education as being more do not know what it is. The one distinction that comes to mind that members of the Council might make would refer to the Council's principle number 9, having to do with the quality of medical care and appropriately educated physicians. I am concerned about what seems to be the belief among many A.m2;:ican hea:i..th pro:2essicna:;,.s and pub~ic officials tna1: lpso iacto any graduate of an LCME accredited medical school is better qualified than every graduate of any foreign medical school. Underlying that belief seems to be a conviction that the process of education in LCME accredited schools ensures the quality of products of those schools. Yet, even a cursory examination of the curricula of LCME schools raises a number of questions about the validity of that conviction. 228 The first question that comes to mind is which process of education in which school? This question devolves from the fact that there exist wide variations in what is taught in LCME schools. Examples* Basic Medical Sciences Range of Total Hours Taught: 1028 Range .-\u00b7 90 340 Microbiology 66 291 Bioche.rnistry 55 272 Range of Weeks of Clerkships: Total 70 110 Medicine 4 24 Surgery 4 22 Pediatrics 4 13 Ob/Gyn 4 12 Psychiatry 2 10 Further questions are raised about the process of education in American med!.cal schools by the prestigious Panel that. prepared the report Phvsicians for the 'IWEfntv-First Century; particularly in the reports of the working groups. *Swanson, \"Medical Education in the United States and Canada, Journal of Medical Education, Nov, 1984 229 Questions raised had to do with matters such as overloading of subject matter by highly specialized basic science faculty members, fragmentation of subject matter as presented by a multitude of highly specialized faculty members, failure to integrate basic and clinical sci\u00b7'\u00b7nce studies, failure of medical schools to reward undergraduate tea2hing, and the suitability of tertiary care hospitals as educationa: sites for medical students. My point in raising these questions is to support my contention that there exists no such thing as~rocess of medical education in LCME schools. There are as many processes as there are schools. Therefore, it. is not tne process of education that should be looked at, but rather the product. With this in mind I strongly support the recommendation of the Subcommittee on FMG's that one examination be used for all applicants for entrance into graduate medical education. Fir~a2.l~:lr I fl1lly s1.1~po!'t. the recomrnend0.tion of the Subcommittee o:i Physician Manpower that at present the Federal Government need not attempt to influence physician manpower supply in the aggregate. On the one hand, the Subcommittee, which predicts a developing oversupply of physicians, recognizes the potential for a number of social benefits deriving therefrom. On the other hand as recognized inherently in the Subcommittee's list of supply and demand variables, the future is difficult to predict. 230 In New York City, for example, a city in which a few years ago discussion was underway about the reduction of total bed capacity by 20 percent, discussions now center around how many additional beds are needed and how quickly they can be made available. In summary, I congratulate members of the Council on progress they have made thus far a~d ask that when ~eeting in plenary session th8y seriously consider the points I have made about access to hospital training for FMG's, and particularly for USFMG's. 231 TESTIMONY OF CHARLES R. MODICA, J.D. CHANCELLOR ST.GEORGE'S UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE GRENADA, WEST INDIES BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION CONCERNING GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION, FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES AND ST. GEORGE'S UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE ON NOVEMBER 19, 1987 233 Members of the Council on Graduate Medical Education, I am very pleased to appear before you to discuss issues related to Foreign Medical Graduates and st. George's University School of Medicine. First, please allow me to commend the Council for the action you have taken over the past year to partake a thorough review of the issues related to Graduate Medical Education financing, and for the comprehensive approach you are taking to recommend improvements. Since st. George's was founde.d in August of 1976, nearly 800 students have graduated with degrees in medicine, many of whom return to the United states to practice in underserved areas. Often in inner-city area teaching hospitals that treat great numbers of low-income and indigent patient populations, 80-90% of residency positions are filled by graduates of foreign medical schools. There would be a significant problem in handling the patient load in many of these hospitals if not for residency slots being filled by eager graduates from non-u.s. schools such as St. George's. The Journal of the American Medical Association, in its January 18, 1985 issue, reported that st. George's University School of Medicine had the highest initial pass rate of all the leading foreign medical schools in the world on the U.S. Qualifying Examination (the ECFMG). As each class at st. George's finishes its second year of medical education, approximately one-third of that 234 class transfers to U.S. medical schools to complete their education. I would like to advise you of two significant developments that are central to the continued progress of our school as a recognized producer of quality medical graduates. First, the New York state Department of Education has reached a decision that approves the placement of third and fourth year students from st. George's to begin clinical clerkships at several of New York's teaching hospitals. About 60 of our third and fourth year medical students are engaged in two-year clerkships at Brooklyn Hospital, Methodist Hospital, and Coney Island Hospital, in Brooklyn. The approval by New York , along with a similar 1985 decision by New Jersey, clearly demonstrates the confidence placed in st. George's by independent state Education Departments after on-sight reviews of our campuses. The approval by New York makes St. George's the only foreign school offering medical education in English that has an approved campus in New York state. Second is, that during last year's rewrite of the Higher Education Act Authorization, Congress recognized the significant contribution that st. George's University School of Medicine makes in the education of a significant number of U.S. citizens who return to the United states after their medical education to become 235 outstanding practicioners of medicine. The Higher Education Act now contains specific criteria that would eliminate most Guaranteed student Loan opportunities for U.S. students attending foreign schools. But, during consideration, Congress included provisions continuing GSL eligibility for U.S. students who attend schools that have a pass rate of 45% or better on the examination administered by the Educational commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG). Under this criteria, St. George's is the only Carribean institution that qualifies, because of its comparatively high pass rate. I mention these two developments for several reasons, but primarily to demonstrate that st. George's is being recognized and singled out as an institution that provides a level of quality education that is not found at many other foreign medical schools. And, that the approval of the states of New Jersey and New York to utilize and train graduates of st. George's suggest they are filling a manpower need not currently being filled by available domestically trained medical graduates. We have reviewed the draft conclusions and recommendations of the COGME Subcommittee on Foreign Medical Graduates. Based on this information we can conclude that the Subcommittee has conducted an extensive review of many of the pertainent issues surrounding Foreign Medical Graduates, and can only recommend that the Council seriously consider, and recommend in its report that these 236 conclusions be drawn upon by decision makers in Congress, federal agencies, and organized medicine. The extensive review conducted by the FMG Subcommittee points out several items that I wish to reiterate: ISSUE 1) Conclusion 1.1 states that the exclusion, abrupt or phased, of FMG's from residency training will impact current hospital based services. Conclusion 1.4 describes the extensive disruptions in service in 84 large public and non-profit teaching hospitals in several states, and further points out that these hospitals have between 25% and 100% FMG dependency and have very high indigent care service population. Recommendation l.A. cautions against reducing GME financial support for FMG's until adequate health care delivery alternatives are available. ISSUE 2) Conclusion 2.1 states that no person, including a graduate of a U.S. Medical School, has an absolute right or entitlement to a graduate medical education position. Conclusion 2.2 says that if the Government has no factual basis forcategorically denying public funds for graduates of Foreign Medical Schools it could be considered constitutionally discriminatory. Recommendation 2.A. states that the Federal Government should not differentiate among graduates from Foreign Medical Schools 237 based on citizenship or immigration status in actions which may affect access to GME. ISSUE 3) Conclusion 3.1 states that there is a strong possibility that US relations with foreign countries will be harmed if educational opportunities for international exchange visitors are reduced as a by product of general reductions in Graduate Medical Education opportunities. Recommendation 3.A. states that exchange visitors in traditional GME should continue to be supported like all other participants in GME. ISSUE 4) Recommendation 4.A. says the Federal Government should not attempt to add further evaluative requirements for FMG1s for entry into Graduate Medical Education programs. It is further recommended that, for credibility purposes, assurances of the comparability of current screening examinations be imple\u00ad mented. The provision of one examination for all entrants into GME is recommended if it is the only means to achieve this. ISSUE 5) Conclusion 5.1 states that it would be presumptious and unwise for the United States to attempt to provide recogni\u00ad tion or accreditation for medical education outside its domain. Recommendation 5.A. says that the Federal Government 238 should not enter into the establishment of a system for recognition or accreditation of Foreign Medical Schools. The conclusions and recommendations of your group, carefully studied and thought out througout the last year speak for themselves. Clearly this comprehensive review of the issues related to Foreign Medical Graduates has confirmed the critical need to continue Graduate Medical Education support for graduates of foreign medical schools. Now is the time for Congress, the Federal Government, and organized U.S. medicine to recognize the contribution that Foreign Medical Graduates make to the health care of millions of Americans, and the important role they play in todays delivery system. Thank you for the opportunity to present our views and, again, thank you for the comprehensive approach you have taken to review this important issue. 239 HEALTH MANPOWER COMMITTEE November 16, 1987 I. COGME II. a) 14 societies have submitted their Physician Supply Matrices in a form suitable for submission to COGME. 1) We support COGME in genera.! principles concerning the health of American people 2) We again want to bring to your attention the eight principles adopted by CMSS concerning the financing of Graduate Medical Education Financing of Graduate Medical Education -Eight Principles 1. Federal funds should continue to support GME in the United States 2. other patient care funds should continue to support GME in the United States 3. Federal funds should support graduates of LCME-approved medical schools only 4. Federal funds should support resident in ACGME-approved programs only 5. Funding should provide support to allow every graduate of an LCME-approved school to obtain necessary GME 6. Separate funding should support the GME of alien foreign medical graduates who will return to their native country to practice 7. Studies to determine physician specialty and geographic manpower needs should be encouraged and supported 8. Numbers of residency positions, by specialty and by location, should be based on the adequacy of patients, teachers and facilities, as monitored by ACGME 3) We recognize that COGME is chartered for 10 years, but we are concerned that its budget and staff is limited. Your activity must be scholarly. You can be a leader, an advocate to protect the scholarly nature of GME, a protector of it from political decisions that might result in major damage to the quality education our physicians currently receive. 241 Health Manpower Committee November 16, 1987 Page 2 4) We recognize that the length and content of residencies for individual specialties do vary according to the discipline. Through the years these requirements through the years have been set by scholars heavily involved in and concerned with the appropriate education of our future practitioners. Arbitrary decisions could be made in the development of a cost-saving reimbursement policy that would result in reduced support for GME and grossly interfere with the quality of GME teaching and research. (Indirect costs.) 5) FMG -CMSS recognizes our obligation to alien graduates of foreign medical schools who would benefit from training here and return to their native land. CMSS supports the development of IMSP (International Medical Scholars Program) and lauds COGME for its supportive stance. 6) CMSS supports your efforts to increase opportunities for minorities in the health care field. 7) COGME has taken the position that in the aggregate there is and will be an excess of physicians. With this we agree. The definition of surplus or shortage is difficult. The positive or negative effects on the health care of our citizens is unknown. The definition of a surplus or shortage must include the possibility of the development of new technology, new modalities of treatment and the appearance of new diseases such as AIDS. III. Either on their own and/or at the suggestion of CMSS, many of our societies have developed resident tracking programs --one of them reported the other day --highlights of the ACS report are as follows.

Dean, M.D. Member, Board of Directors November 20, 1987 21+5 I am George Dean, M.D., a member of the Board of Directors of the American Academy of Family Physicians. I also serve as chairman of the Commission on Education and as a clinical associate professor at Wayne State University. On behalf of our more than 60,000 members, I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear before the Council today to share the views of the Academy on the important issues surrounding graduate medical education. We hope that this information will assist the Council in the preparation of its first report to Congress, due in July 1988. The federal government has a responsibility for helping ensure access to quality health care by the American people. Integral to the assurance of access is a supply of physicians appropriate to meet the demand for care. Because of this relationship, the Academy believes that the federal government does have an appropriate and crucial role in supporting graduate medical education through both the Medicare program and targeted Public Health Service grant programs. The Council has stated in its principles #2 and #8 that it should consider the diverse needs of various geographic areas and segments of the population as well as changing patterns of health care delivery in developing its recommendations. We agree wholeheartedly with these principles and believe that the specialty of family practice is helping to meet the needs of diverse populations for health care. We would like to share with you information about the special t~\u00b7 of family practice--where our members locate, how they practice, and for whom they care. 246 Family practice is the premier primary care specialty in the United States, providing comprehensive, continuing care to all members of the family. Family physicians provide ambulatory-based, cost-effective, preventive-oriented care to a broad population of this country. According to 1985 data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 30.5 percent of visits to office-based physicians in the U.S. were to family physicians (Attachment A). LOCATION OF FAlljILY PHYSICIA\"JS Family physicians are continuing to locate in shortage and rural areas in notably larger proportions than other medical specialties, thus helping to address the national problem of geographic maldistribution. Data from the 1986 survey of family practice residency graduates indicates that 90 percent enter active family practice and over 47 percent locate their practices in rural and suburban communities of less than 25,000 (Attachment Bl. Because of their multidisciplinary training, family physicians are able to care for 85 percent of the problems that present in their offices and are particularly adaptable to the diverse needs presented in the various geographic areas. FAMILY PRACTICE AND GERIATRICS Geriatric health care is an important part of the family physician's training and practice. Care provided by family physicians is aimed at 247 keeping the elderly person active, mobile and self-sufficient. According to 1985 data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care survey, visits to family physicians represented 29. 1 percent of the visits to all physicians by the nation's 26.6 million residents age 65 and over (Attachment C), In response to the changing demographics of the population, and in recognition of the specialized body of knowledge and approach to patient care of the elderly, the American Board of Family Practice and the American Board of Internal Medicine have collaborated to develop an examination in geriatric medicine. Those passing the examination will be awarded a certificate of added qualifications in geriatrics. It is important to note that eligibility to take this examination is contingent on current board certification in family practice or internal medicine. The certificate does not convey subspecialty status, nor does it create a new specialty of geriatrics. The ABFP recognizes that geriatrics is one important part of the practice of family practice and, because of that requires that the candidate for added qualifications always be currently certified and recertified in family practice. Geriatrics is an integral part of family practice residency training and an integral part of family practice. In its principle #8, this Council has noted that it must take into account changes in demographics in formulating its recommendations. One of the changes highlighted is the aging population, The Academy would 248 emphasize to the Council that, as described above, family physicians are presently providing their aging patients with quality health care. We therefore believe that the need for additional family physicians to care for the elderly should be considered by the Council in developing its conclusions and recommendations regarding physician supply requirements to care for the aging population, DEMAND FOR FAMILY PHYSICIANS The demand for family physicians is significant and increasing. With the tremendous eA-pa.nsion of the managed care industry and increased emphasis on cost-effectiveness, family practice residency-trained graduates are at a premium, sought after to manage those systems. Communities, particularly in rural areas, continue to seek famil;\\' phys-icians to meet their comprehensive health care needs, Trends in Medicare call for alternatives to costly inpatient care and emphasize the type of less expensive ambulatory-based care provided by family physicians. Medicaid and Family Practice: A significant portion of office based physician services received by Medicaid recipients is provided by family physicians. According to HCFA data in FY85 there were 21,800,000 Medicaid recipients. Since Medicaid recipients cover all age groups (though perhaps greater numbers of women and children) and the program varies greatly from state to state, it is not possible to determine the exact percentage of Medicaid 249 recipients treated by any specialty, However, extrapolating from the 1985 NAMCS, one could assume that, since visits to family physicians represent 30.5 percent of all visits to all office based physicians as compared with 11.6 percent to internists, 11.4 percent to pediatricians and 8.9 percent to obstetricians/gynecologists, a comparable differential could be used for percentages of Medicaid patient visits. Pediatrics and Family Practice: Data indicate that famHy physicians care for a significant percentage of the pediatric age population. In 1985, 51,905,000 U.S. residents were under 15 years of age, representing 22.6 percent of the total resident population.' The NAMCS that same year reported that 18.7 percent (118,769,000 visits) of total visits to office-based physicians were vi.sits by patients under 15 years of age. Visits by patients under 15 to family physicians totaled 29,659,000, which represents 25 percent of the visits by patients under 15 years (Attachment C) . Though pediatric care may be given to some patients 15 and older and a portion is given in other than the ambulatory setting, when assessing the delivery of primary care, it is realistic to state that 20 to 25 percent of pediatric care is provided by family physicians. 1Current population Reports, Population Estimates and Projections. Series P-25, No. 985:20-21. 250 Because of the breadth of services provided to all age groups by family physicians, the need for family physicians in rural and underserved areas, and the demand for family physicians in prepaid medical care delivery systems, the Academy believes that the supply of family physicians must be increased. SUPPLY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS Concurrent 1<ith the increased demand for family physicians is a supply unable to keep pace. With more than one-third of family physicians/general practitioners age 55 and older, attrition from practice for this age group is e>.'})ected to be high. The number of family practice residency programs, which e>.'})erienced tremendous growth from the inception of the specialty in 1969 until 1982, has now leveled off at approximately 382 programs with 2456 first year residents. The growth of family practice residencJ' programs began to level off in 1983, paralleling the leveling off of federal support of family practice training programs. The total number of residents in family practice residency programs in July 1986 was 7446, a slight drop from the 1985 high (Attachment D). Minority residents represented 11.6 percent of this 1986 population and female residents represent 27. 7 percent I Attachments E and F) . As a percentage of the total resident population in 1985, family practice 251 represented 9.8 percent, and the combined primary care specialties of family practice, pediatrics and general internal medicine represented only 30.5 percent of total residency positions.' a As a new specialty with a unique training model family practice has been faced with difficult financial constraints. Over two thirds of residency programs are located in community hospitals affiliated with universities, rather than located in traditional tertiary medical centers. The AAFP is making a significant effort to increase family practice residency affiliation with connnunity health centers, migrant health centers and free clinics. Due to the emphasis on ambulatory, preventive care, reimbursement from Medicare and other third party payors is significantly less than for inpatient, procedurally oriented services. The federal support provided to graduate medical education through the Medicare program, although less for family practice than for other training programs, remains an important source of financial viability. Targeted federal support through the Public Health Service grants continues to be extremely important to beth residency programs and departments of famil;\\' medicine within medical schools. The family practice residency program consists of three years of specialty training that includes the disciplines of internal medicine, surgery, 'Medical Education in the U.S. 1985-1986. JAMA 1987;256(12):1588. 3Kallenberg G, Riegelman R, Hockey L. Waiting for the Doctor Glut, or is the Calvary Really Coming. Journal of General Internal Medicine. 1987;2:252. 252 pediatrics, obstetrics-gynecology, psychiatry, problems of aging and ' ' community medicine, As noted above, the majority of program are located in community hospitals affiliated with universities, rather than located in traditional tertiary medical centers. One-half of the program are in hospitals that have only a single residency training program, Various ''< studies of these programs indicate a cost distribution of about one third resident salaries/fringe benefits, one-third faculty and administrative ' costs, and one-third overhead costs of the family practice center. Revenue sources are largely comprised of government support, practice revenues and hospital support. Over two-thirds of family practice programs have direct state support, and one-half of the programs have had federal training grant support. Patient care revenues have been\u00b7unable to support the training programs and it appears unlikely they ever will be able to do so under the current reimbursement structure. Experience indicates that revenues from patient care have been able to fund onl;,' one-third of the cost of family practice residency training. Typically, Medicare reimbursement for ambulatory-based, preventive-oriented services is significantly less than for procedurally-oriented inpatient services. This also tends to be the case for other third party payors. As a result, family practice training with its ambulatory emphasis, is unable to become \"self-sufficient\" from patient care revenues under the present Medicare reimbursement scheme. 253 According to the report \"Impsct of Federal Support on Family Practice Residency Training,\" prepared for the Department of Health and Human Services, federal funding has been positively associated with the formation and stability of family practice residency programs. For example, from 1979 to 1984, unfunded programs expired 3.7 times more often than funded programs. In recent years the role of federal funding has shifted from new program growth t0 program support and maintenance; this has been coincidental with the leveling off of federal support. The report further notes that the absence of federal funding may have disproportionately severe consequences for smaller and cormiunity based family practice residency programs. The Academ~c encourages CXXlME to study the financial disincentives to ambulatory based residency training and to develop recommendations to Congress which would shift Medicare incentives in the direction of primary care traini'l,g. In the budget reconciliation legislation now being considered in Congress, both the House and Senate packages include provisions which would increase Medicare reimbursement for primary care services at a higher rate than for other physician services. We believe that this is an important step toward the long term reform of the Medicare program, which ultimately may have positive implications for family practice training. Kelly N, Franklin S, Hubbard S, Huse D. Impsct of Federal Support on Family Practice Residency Training. Report prepared for the Department of Health and Human Services, 1986;6. 254 In view of the above, we are concerned that the preliminary recommendations of the Manpower Subcommittee under \"specialty supply\" do not call for a federal role. The Academy encourages the Council to recognize the significant role that federal funds have played in the initial development, growth and maintenance of family practice programs and to consider recommending an increase in the targeted federal support to family practice training programs. CONCLUSION In summary, the American Academy of Family Physicians believes that the goal of assuring access to quality health care by the American people as emphasized in the Council's first principle can be met only if the supply of physicians is appropriate to meet the demand for services, Given the current demand for the services of family physicians, the supply is inadequate and will remain so without deliberate efforts to train more family physicians. We encourage the Council on Graduate Medical Education to take into account the continuing federal responsibility for helping to address access to care through sound health manpower policies and to develop recommendations which reflect this commitment, 255 ATTACHMENT A ll\u00b7B\u00b71 NUMBER AND PERCENT DISTRIBUTION OF OFFICE VISITS BY PHYSICIAN SPECIALTY; TYPE OF PRACTICE, AND PROFESSIONAL IDENTITY: UNITED S'IJITES, 1985 Number of Physician Specialty.

American Academy of Pediatrics T E S T I M 0 N Y BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION ON PEDIATRIC MANPOWER AND TRAINING PRESENTED BY ROBERT JOHNSON, M.D., F.A.A.P. on behalf of Ambulatory Pediatr.ic Association American Academy of Pedl.atr.i.cs Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairmen November 20, 1987 263 Mr. Chairman and members of the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), I am Dr. Robert Johnson, Director, Adolescent Medicine and Associate Professor of Clinical Pediatrics, New Jersey Medical School. I am here on behalf of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the Ambulatory Pediatric Association (APA), and the Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairmen, organiza\u00ad tions dedicated to the health, safety and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and young adults. Our organizations are com\u00ad mitted to ensuring that future generations of children and adolescents receive quality health care. Our purpose in testifying before you today is to assist the Council in its efforts to make responsible graduate medical education and physician manpower recommendations to the Congress. While we recognize the high degree of uncertainty inherent in estimating the optimal match between future children's health needs and manpower requirements, to err in this endeavor places the health of the country at risk. I would first like to respond to the COGME' s preliminary conclu\u00ad sions regarding the overall supply of pediatricians. Second, I will discuss two major problems which we believe frustrate and impede efforts to predict future requirements for pediatricians --the unmet needs of children's health care and the maldistribution of pediatri\u00ad cians. Third, I will speak to the problem of ensuring quality health care. Last, I will address the financing of graduate medical educa\u00ad tion and in particular, our concern for continued federal support of Title VII grants. 264 In the last 50 years the practice of pediatrics has undergone tre\u00ad mendous change due to our success in managing inf ectio~s diseases such as tetanus, pertussis, diphtheria, measles and rubella. Where parents used to live in fear of these deadly childhood diseases, parents today have every reason to expect th~ir children to live long and healthy lives. The practice of pediatrics has also changed as a result of new technologies. Increasingly, pediatricians are caring for the special long-term needs of the chronically ill and of children with disabili\u00ad ties. Furthermore, pediatrics has also changed as a result of the dynamic and complex social and familial tians.formations occurring in society. Noi;-1 more than ever, pediatricians are called upon to meet t~e psychosocial and behavioral needs of children and adolescents, issues which demand significantly more treatment time. As a result of specialized graduate medical training, pediatri\u00ad cians are uniquely qualified to provide the preventive, psychosocial, behavioral, chronic and acute care needed by children and adolescents. Pediatricians receive three years of advanced training explicitly in pediatrics. Those pediatricians who wish to further specialize in neonatology or critical care pediatrics, or pediatric cardiology, nephrology, hematology/oncology, pulmonology, endocrinology, or ado\u00ad lescent medicine train for an additional two or three years. Supply and Demand Factors in Pediatrics Research by the AAP finds that there will be approximately 44 ,000 general pediatricians by 1990 and 58,000 by the year 2000. This 265 corroborates the predictions made by the Bureau of Health Professions which estimated that there will be 45,000 pediatricians by 1990 and 57 ,ODO by the year 2000. We believe that there are many factors which could mitigate these supply projections, including changes in medical school enrollment, the number of foreign medical graduates and altera\u00ad tions in the size and content of pediatric residency programs. Nevertheless, current data indicate that, similar to the other primary care specialties, the projected aggregate supply of pediatricians is adequate. However, raw national numbers do not tell the whole story. Experience has demonstrated that, given the state of flux in the health care system, estimating the need for pediatricians is as much an art as a science. It is evident that many factors, which are dif- ficult to assess in terms of their positive or negative impact and magnitude, will influence future numbers of pediatricians. These include the growth of alternative delivery systems, such as HMOs and PPOs; the use of new technologies; the increased demand for more time in parent and patient counseling and anticipatory guidance; complex psychosocial behavioral needs; and the emergence of new chronic or infectious diseases such as AIDs. Even more important may be the impact the emerging adolescent morbidities, such as teen pregnancy, suicide and substance abuse, will have on requirements for pediatri- cians. Two examples of pediatrician demand factors which were once assumed would lessen the necessary numbers of pediatricians now appear to be neutral rather than negative influences. These are the growth 266 in the supply of allied health professionals and the increasing number of women entering pediatrics. The contemporary view of the services provided by nurse practitioners and physician assistants is that they are complementary to rather than substitutive for services provided by pediatricians. Although the proportion of women in pediatrics is increasing as projected, it is unClear if their future practice pat\u00ad terns will differ significantly from those of their male counterparts. Given the uncertainties surrounding pediatric manpower needs, we differ with the COGME's preliminary assessments stating that pediatrics is an oversupplied specialty. CHILD HEALTH CARE NEEDS/MALDISTRIBUTION OF PEDIATRICIANS Two principal factors cause us to question the reliability of COGME's conclusions for the long term. These factors are the unmet health care needs of children and adolescents and the maldistribution of pediatricians across the co\u00b5ntry. Children constitute the largest age group living in poverty in our nation and the numbers are growing. One-fifth of children live below the federal poverty level; 21 percent live in single-parent house\u00ad holds. There are approximately 12 to 16 million children who are uninsured for their health care. Post-neonatal mortality rates h\u00b5ve increased and have been increasing for the last several years. The disturbing fact is that these mortality rates. are attributed mostly to environmental factors. Eighty percent of these babies were of average birthweights. They simply were unable to get the kind of family and 267 health support in their community they needed to make it to their first birthday. We live in a nation where the average life span is increasing, while at the same time infants are dying at inordinately high rates. We continue to be a world leader in medical technologies, yet many of our children fail to receive the most basic of preventive health ser\u00ad vices. At a time when policy makers focus their attention on con\u00ad taining health costs, we are overlooking the millions of children and pregnant women that lack even minimum financial resources to purchase care. But this tide is beginning to turn, albeit slowly. Children's health care needs are emerging as an issue on the national agenda and pediatricians are taking a lead role in this crusade. The maldistribution of pediatricians in both rural and inner city areas of the country will continue to confound attempts to assess future pediatric manpower requirements. The AAP has undertaken several initiatives to support pediatricians practicing in rural areas. Through grants from the Division of Maternal Child Health and private foundations, Starting Rural Practice workshops have been held at the past five AAP annual scientific meetings. These day long programs have been geared to residents and have highlighted the speci\u00ad fics of rural practice. Also, a network of state rural health coor\u00ad dinators has been developed and materials addressing concerns of rural physicians are being distributed through this network and among resi\u00ad dents, medical students and organizations involved in recruiting phy- sicians to rural areas. 268 We therefore contest any federal policy .which would alter the future supply of pediatricians. We recommend that current levels of pediatric residents be maintained until data are found to substantiate either an increase or decrease in the numbers of residents based upon changes in children's health care needs. QUALITY HEALTH CARE Steps must be taken to ensure the continued quality of pediatric graduate medical education. We are concerned both about the continued quality of pediatric training programs as well as the quality of indi\u00ad vidual candidates entering pediatric residency programs. The goal of pediatric residency education is to produce primary care physicians capable of caring for infants, children and ado\u00ad lescents, performing as advocates for that population, and counseling their families. Each of these functions is a critical role for today's pediatrician and together they constitute a complex set of responsibilities. Pediatric education and the service delivery systems should be responsive to the health needs of children and ado\u00ad lescents. Future pediatricians will be expected to ~anage both acute and chronic health problems, manage children with emotional disturban\u00ad ces and with disabling conditions, provide counseling for problems that are psychosocial or behavioral in nature, utilize community resources, collaborate with others of the health care team, and, for those in private practice, manage the practice efficiently. It follows, therefore, that the training for such a profession must reflect these needs. The Residency Review Committee, the body 269 responsible for drafting the special requirements for training, periodically evaluates the minimum requirements and makes changes as needed. As the practice of pediatrics has expanded, so have the requirements. Increased emphasis on training in ambulatory care has resulted from the recognition that even complex pediatric problems can often be best managed on an ambulatory basis. Furthermore, continuity of care can best be learned through caring for patients on a regular, long\u00ad term basis, especially those with chronic disease or with a disabi\u00ad lity. Ambulatory training also provides an excellent opportunity for residents to learn to cooperate with other caregivers. Such training should include care for acute illnesses, trauma, counseling, anticipa\u00ad tory guidance, planning and managing the long-term care of children with disabilities and chronic conditions, and caring for adolescents. Pediatric residency education increasingly depends on t\\1e use of high\u00ad quality, non-traditional educational settings, i.e., ambulatory and outpatient clinics, community-based clinics, and private practices. The faculty for such a program must be trained in the delivery of ambulatory care as well as in hospital-based services. Financial sup\u00ad port for faculty development is crucial to the success to residency programs. The pediatrician also must be capable of caring for the severely ill chiid in the hospital ~nvironment, whether that child is a newborn or an older child. Residents must learn the complex processes of treatment and decision-making and how to care for patients requiring 270 multidisciplinary care. Planned, progressive levels of responsibility in such a setting are essential. Only high caliber candidates should be permitted entrance to pediatric residency programs, regardless of whether they are U.S. or foreign born. We believe that all candidates for pediatric residency programs should take uniform qualifying exams. In addition, foreign trained physicians should undergo clinical and language competency evaluations. Like the Council, we support an international scholars program. Qualified foreign nationals should be allowed to train in the United States, but should be required to return to their home countries where critical shortages of pediatricians frequently exist. Foreign-trained nonboard-certified physicians (FMGs) are a signi\u00ad ficant percentage of pediatricians. In 1985, 26 percent of all general pediatricians were foreign medical graduates as compared with 21.5 percent for the total physician population. The disproportionate representation of FMGs in pediatrics will likely continue. Between 1982 and 1984 the proportion of FMGs in pediatric residency programs increased from 24.5 percent to 27.8 percent. In contrast, the propor\u00ad tion of FMGs in the total resident population decreased from 19 per\u00ad cent to 18 percent. The impact of FMGs on children's and adolescents' care is a con~ cern for pediatrics. The performance of FMGs on the certification examinations administered by the American Board of Pediatrics can be measured. In the 1986 exams, 82 percent of the U.S./Canadian can- 271 didates passed the written portion compared with only 32 percent of the FMGs. On the oral examination, 88 percent of the U.S./Canadian candidates passed compared with 65 percent of the FMGs. The AAP has in previous testimony made several recommendations with regard to FMGs. Since FMGs tend to fill positions in large urban areas rather than in suburban, private practice situations, we do recognize that the withdrawal of residents from the pediatric work\u00ad force, especially in inner city areas, will create a manpower shortage in certain hospitals. The Academy has received a contract from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to explore alter\u00ad native arrangements for staffing pediatric services. The Residency Replacement Project will document strategies that have been employed by hospitals to decrease dependency on residents for the staffing of pediatric services without compromising access to and quality of inpa\u00ad tient and ambulatory care. The results of the study will be available in early 1988 and are expected to assist other hospitals in making similar staffing transitions. Tl1e integrity of our pediatric residericy programs_ must be safe\u00ad guarded. Institutional service needs should not be allowed to deter\u00ad mine the size or content of residency programs. Those programs whose principal functions have become the staffing of institutional clinics should be reduced or eliminated. FINANCING Finally, I would like to address the financing of graduate medical education. We believe that existing federal, state and private se-ctor 272 funding levels must be maintained. New and innovative ways must be explored to support the increased need to train residents in ambula\u00ad tory ~ettings (such as outpatient clinics, physicians' offices, or HMOs) as well as in traditional inpatient settings. This funding should be provided up to and beyond primary board eligibility. Furthermore, Title VII, the Health Professions Training Assistance Act, funding should be continued and augmented so that more pediatric residency programs may benefit. This funding is critical in light of the increased need to train pediatricians in community settings and in the care of children and adolescents with behavioral and psychosocial problems. The creativity allowed by this program has enabled resi\u00ad dency programs to use non-traditional sites and to encourage pediatri\u00ad cians to practice in underserved areas. Decreases in this funding would impair the ability of existing programs to continue this aspect. COGME's Subcommittee on Graduate Medical Education Programs and Financing recognized the dilemma surrounding the need for ambulatory care training and the lack of sufficient financial support. We applaud that subcommittee's recommendation that primary! care training requires the use of ambulatory and other non-traditional sites and that federal and state support for such training programs must be, at a minimum, maintained. In summary, we believe that federa'l manpower policies should not place children's future access to health care at risk, particularly when history has demonstrated that manpower predictions are based upon assumptions that invariably change over time. We ask that COGME: 2 73 1) Reconsider its manpower supply conclusions with regard to pediatrics, 2) Maintain current levels of pediatric residents until hard data can substantiate changes based upon evolving child health care needs, 3) Ensure the continued quality of pediatric graduate medical education both in the content of contemporary training programs and in the quality of candidates for these programs, including those that are foreign trained. 4) Continue financial support of pediatric residency programs, particularly Title VII grants. We look forward to continuing to work with this panel and are ready to supply further information at your request. 274 STATEMENT of the AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS Submitted to the COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION November 20, 1987 The American College of Physicians (ACP) is pleased to have this oppor\u00ad tunity to appear before you today to present our views on a number of issues concerning graduate medical education. M.D., F.A.C.P., President of the College. I am Lawrence Scherr, The College represents over 65,000 doctors of internal medicine, subspecialists, and physicians-in-training. Our membership includes private practitioners delivering primary health care; medical specialists in such fields as gastroenterology, endocrinology, oncology, and cardiology; medical educators; and researchers. Since its inception in 1915, the College has sought to uphold high standards in medical education, medical practice, and medical research. For more than a decade, the American College of Physicians has expressed concern about an impending oversupply of physicians. The College, aware of the high costs required to educate and train each physician and the large public subsidy involve'd, believes that the nation can ill afford to continue building an aggregate surplus of physicians. Instead, ways must be found to better distribute physician 275 manpower among medical specialties and across geographic areas. A national policy is needed that will assure adequate funding for graduate medical education, and that will help to better match health manpower supply with national health care needs. We believe that this Council, with its 10-year charter to study policy issues related to the supply and distribution of physicians and to advise the Secretary of HHS, as well as to make recommendations to specific committees of Congress, has a unique opportunity to facilitate the development of a much needed, coherent, comprehensive, national health manpower policy. We commend the Council for beginning its task by identifying the principles that will underlie its future recommendations. We would like to highlight a few of those principles, which we understand are being considered for inclusion in the Council's first report. CoGME PRINCIPLES The American College of Physicians agrees whole heartedly that, \"The primary concern of the Council must be the health of the American people,\" and that, \"There must be assured access for all to quality \u00b7medical care.\" We further concur with the principle that, \"The quality of medical care as well as the adequacy of the supply of physicians are products of the medical education system. Hence, assurance of access to good care requires the assurance of sufficient numbers. of appropriately educated physicians.\" We also v:ant to express our agreement with the Council's acknowledgement that there are diverse 276 needs among various geographic areas and segments of the population, and that conclusions and solutions based on averages wi 11 often ignore these diverse needs. Further, we favor the Council's preference for targeted programs to achieve desired goals such as increasing representation of minorities in the health professions. Finally, we wish to commend the Council for recognizing that its recommendations must include an international perspective and must take into account changes in demographics, changes in disease patterns (such as the AIDS epidemic), and changes in patterns of health care delivery (such as increased emphasis on ambulatory care). We now wish to respond to the request for comments on specific issues being considered by the Council. PHYSICIAN MANPOWER Despite substantial changes affecting the organization and delivery of health care and past warnings of a major imbalance between the supply and need for physicians, American medical schools have continued to produce numbers of graduates that are far in excess of national needs. Thus, the nation is faced with an impending surplus of physicians that may substantially exceed the levels predicted by the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) L_l_ in 1980. 277 Recently, Lewin and Associates, Inc. completed a study L.1_ for the Federated Council for Internal Medicine (FCIM) of which the College is an organizational member, that attempted to update the GMENAC projections for Internal Medicine and extend them from 1990 to 2020. Even with adjustments for increasing patient care needs due to the AIDS epidemic, changes in physician productivity by gender, and other adjustments based on more recent data on population growth, the Lewin study shows that the aggregate numbers of physicians in Internal Medicine will continue to show a slight excess each year beyond the levels required, and that the surplus will range from 10-20%. Nevertheless, if current trends continue, increasing shortages will result each year for General Internists, while surpluses will persist for most medical specialists. We do not agree with the conclusion of the Subcommittee on Physician Manpower that there is no convincing evidence that a physician surplus will lead to socially undesirable consequences. In 1975, 42,303 students applied for admission to US allopathic medical schools. Of these, 15,365, about one-third, were accepted. In 1986, only 28,500 students applied, but approximately 16,000 were accepted. L]__ Thus, in little more than one decade, the chances of being accepted into medical school have increased from 1 in 3, to about 1 out of 1.8. If trends of the past several years persist, by 1992 our medical schools will be accepting 4 out of every 5 applicants. Based on analyses of the aptitude test scores and cumulative grade point averages of the applicants since 1984, such a high acceptance rate will mean reduced average scholastic achievement levels among those who enter medical 278 school. Thus, as medical schools maintain or increase enrollments in the face of a declining applicant pool, the quality of medical school students, as indicated by objective measures of scholastic ability, can be expected to decrease. These trends may seriously jeopardize the quality of future medical care, particularly in light of the inability of the medical marketplace to deter the overprovision of medical services. With regard to the effects of a physician surplus, lessons can be learned from studies that have been made of the experiences of Israel and some of the countries of Western Europe. Li_,L'i_ In addition, serious concerns have been raised about the implications for this country of a physician surplus on the overutilization of medical services. L_\u00a7__-/10 Consequently, we recommend that no new medi ca 1 schoo 1 s (all opa th i c or osteopathic) should be established in the United States, and that no existing schools should increase in terms of class size. We suggest that all allopathic and osteopathic m!=dical schools should participate in a national initiative to achieve an overall reduction in medical school enrollments. However, in no event sho~ld there be reductions in enrollments of students fron1 underrepresented mino~ity groups (Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans). While we agree with the Manpower Subcommittee's prelimi,nary conclusion that an oversupply of physicians cou~d be potentially beneficial in addressing problems of access, past experience has shown that merely increasing the ag_gregate supply of physicians will not assu1-e that adequate numbers of physicians are available throughout the United 279 States or that physicians will be distributed well among the medical specialties. This reality has been recognized by public policymakers since at least the mid-1970s, when Congress realized that after more than a decade of federal health manpower initiatives, problems of geographic and specialty distribution of health professions personnel appeared to have worsened. /11,/12 Congress responded by enacting the Health Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1976 (P.L. 94-484), declaring that an aggregate national shortage of physicians no longer existed and providing incentives to encourage physicians to enter into specialties and to locate their practices in areas where needs were greatest. This same challenge persists today. Wood Johnson Foundation /13, based Recent estimates by the Robert on a 1986 national survey indicates that \"43 million Americans consider that they have no physician, clinic, or hospital that is their regular source of medical care.\" The survey further revealed that, \"the equivalent of 38.8 million Americans reported needing health care, but having difficulty obtaining it.\" Consequently, 1ve do not believe that continuing to generate an excessive supply of physicians in the hopes that some of these physicians will be driven by market forces to locate in underserved areas is an appropriate response to the problems of access: Vie believe that Federal health manpower policy should seek to assure access to good quality health care for those who are now medically underserved. We, therefore, support the Subcommittee's recommendations that targeted efforts are still needed to address identified problems 280 such as specialty mix and geographic distribution of physicians, that financial support for medical education should foster training in ambulatory settings, and that incentives should be strengthened to encourage physicians to locate and remain fn health manpower shortage areas. Historically, Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans have been under\u00ad represented in medical schools and in the medical profession relative to their proportion of the total population. Although the proportion of minority medical students from Black and Hispanic groups increased during the period of rapid expansion of medical school enrollments (mid-1960s to the mid-1970s), this progress has eroded during the past decade /14. Between 1975-76 and 1986-87, the proportion of minority applicants rose from .7.2 to 10.2% of all applicants, but the acceptance rate, percent of all acceptees, and the absolute number of first year enrollees for minorities have shown only modest increases. L_1i,/16 The American College of Physicians believes that there shQ!Jld be equality of opportunity for careers in medicine and that increasing representation of underrepresented minority groups in medical schoDls and in the profession should be a national goal of hig.11 priority. Consequently, we also favor governmental financial assistance programs and medical school enrollment policies to assure that opportunities are available to pursue medical careers for students from minority and economically disadvantaged groups. Even in light of an overall surplus of physicians, federally supported financial assistance will be 281 required to ensure that opportunities for medical careers are not restricted based on family income, and that opportunities are increased for underrepresented minority students. Furthermore, continued federal financial support for the costs of graduate medical education will be necessary to assure that specialty decisions are not dictated by financial considerations. FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES Educational programs accredited by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) are the most appropriate means for educating physicians for practice in the United States. In an era of fiscal constraint and growing abundance of physician graduates from accredited medical programs, it is difficult to justify the ex pen di tu re of public monies to support either undergraduate medical education at foreign medical schools or US residency training for graduates of such unaccredited schools. However, abrupt withdrawal of all public financial support for FMG residency training could cause severe problems for those teaching hospitals that rely most heavily upon FMGs for the provision of patient care services and the communities they serve. Therefore, we favor a pol icy of providing US public funds for the support of undergraduate medical education only for accredited programs and a phased elimination of public financial support from patient care revenues for US residency tr~ining of graduates of unaccredited foreign medical schools. 282 Opportunities for appropriate graduate medical education in the United States should be maintained for limited numbers of alien physicians who enter as exchange visitors and who will return to their country of origin upon completion of training. Barriers to entry into graduate medical education for exchange visitor physicians should be modified, and educational experiences for such physicians should be of the highest quality and in disciplines appropriate to practice in the home country. Funding for the residency training of exchange visitors should be from sources other than patient care revenues, including, where possible, sources from the physician's home country. The United States' role in international medical education should also include fostering the development of educational resources in other nations. There should also be federal financial support for the graduate medical education of refugees who meet all examination and certification requirements for admission to an ACGME-accredited US medical residency training program. All foreign mediql graduates, including those who have their own sources of funding, should be required to meet the same standards of medical knowledge in the basic and clinical sciences and possess clinical skills comparable to those required of graduates from schools accredited by the LCME and the ADA. GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND FINANCING The Subcommittee on Graduate Medical Education Programs and Financing has identified some of the factors that have eroded the financial 283 support for graduate medical education, and has recommended that changes in financing should be undertaken in an evolutionary manner rather than precipitously. The College agrees with the wisdom of this approach. We wish to emphasize that graduate medical education is fundamentally linked with patient care and for practical purposes is inseparable from patient care. Therefore, patient care revenues should continue to be an appropriate source of funding for GME. Thus, we also support the Subcommittee's recommendation that, \"For the ti me being, payments for direct costs of GME should be continued through existing mechanisms, utilizing current sources, conduits and recipients.'' The Subcommittee has also rightly focused on the problem of financing training for primary care and geriatrics, particularly in ambulatory settings. We agree with the proposed recommendations that call for funding of demon strati on programs to deve 1 op some a 1 ternati ve methods of payment for such training, and for continuation of existing programs of federal and state support. However, we would hope that the Council would go even further to make specific recommendations to encourage graduate medical education in ambulatory settings. We further suggest that the Council review the requirement under the federal Primary Care Training Grant program (Title VII. of the Educational Assistance Act) that each resident spend a minimum of 25% of training time providing primary care to a defined panel of patients. This so called ''continuity'' requirement has been rigidly applied and is a deterent to obtaining federal funding for many primary care training programs. Consideration should be given to reducing this requirement to 20%. 284 The Subcommittee has ca 11 ed for study of a number of other prob 1 ems including the--unexplained variance in costs among graduate medical education programs, insufficient representation of minorities within the health professions, and the need for a review of the structure and content of undergraduate and graduate medical education. Some of this research is currently underway and is being conducted by the Congresiional Budget Office and others. Nevertheless, the College agrees that more research in these areas is needed. Finally, there is an additional matter that warrants serious attention . The Co 11 ege has maintained for a number of yea rs that . . decisions on national health manpower policy must be based on sound data upon which we all can have confidence. More recently, as the College and other major Internal Medicine organizations have struggled with our own private sector initiative to update GMENAC data regarding Internal Medicine, we have been reminded that development o,f accurate manpower data is a complex and difficult task. A national manpower data base should not be dependent solely upon the good faith efforts of th .. e individual specialty societies. Instead, the federal government must be involved in a credible data collection effort that provides some consistency and uniformity. This Council is charged with providing advice and recommendations on the following: \"(F) deficiencies in, and needs for improvements in, existing data bases concerning the supply and distribution of, and postgraduate training programs for, physicians in the United States and steps that should be taken to eliminate those deficiencies.\" (CHARTER) 285 We, therefore, seriously urge that you give attention to this subject and give high priority in the future to the need to develop a national data base. CONCLUSIONS A comprehensive national health manpower policy is needed that involves long-range planning and coordination of the supply and specialty distri\u00ad bution of medical manpower. It should address the aggregate size of undergraduate medical school enrollments, the number of graduate resi\u00ad dency training positions, as well as the number of foreign medical school graduates permitted entry into the United States. Attention must be given specifically to the problem of how to meet the patient care needs of minority and underserved populations. National goals should be developed not only for the supply and distribution of graduates of United States allopathic medical schools, but also for the numbers of graduates of US osteopathic medical schools and the numbers of graduates of foreign medical schools who are either US citizens or aliens seeking to practice medicine in the United States. Without such a comprehensive and coordinated\u00b7 national physician manpower policy, voluntary cutbacks in US al lopathic medical school enrollments wi 11 be offset by increases in the numbers of physicians from these other sources. 286 The American College of Physicians urges the Council on Graduate Medical Education to take the lead in developing such a policy, and looks forward to working with the Counci 1 over the course of its ten year authorization to help solve some of the perplexing problems that have been identified. Thank you. I would be pleased to respond to any questions. 287 REFERENCES 1. Graduate Medi ca 1 Nati ona 1 Advisory Committee. Summary Report to the Secretary of Hea 1th and Human Services.

November 20, 1987 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME), I am George L. Jordan, Jr., M.D., F.A.C.S., professor of surgery at the Baylor School of Medicine in Houston, Texas and a member of the Board of Regents of the American College of Surgeons (ACS). I am pleased to appear before you today on behalf of the College to discuss policies and trends affecting our nation's graduate medical education system. ACS is a voluntary educational and scientific organization devoted to the ethical and competent practice of surgery and enhancing the quality of care provided to surgical patients. For nearly 75 years, ACS has provided educational programs for its Fellows, who now number more than 50,000, and other surgeons in this country and throughout the world. The College establishes standards of practice, disseminates medical knowledge, and provides information to the general public. ACS agrees with COGME' s general principles that the health of the American people and their access to quality medical care are primary concerns. We believe these interests are best served by assuring an adequate number of both generalists and specialists to meet patient de\u00ad mands. 291 Financing Issues Federal programs of financial support for medical education have significantly improved access to care and have contributed to the worldwide preeminence of American medicine and surgery. It is important to stress, however, that because of its profound influence the federal government must be extremely cautious in executing broad changes in its policy of financing graduate medical education. For example, reductions in the length of time for which the government will provide direct support for educational costs could impose a severe financial burden on our nation's teaching hospitals and have serious implications for the quality of physician training programs. The number of residency years needed to educate and train surgeons has been determined by educators in each surgical specialty and is under constant review by Residency Review Committees in light of changing technology and clinical advances. An effort to reduce the number of years for education and training in general surgery was once attempted, but it was clearly recog\u00ad nized that individuals completing such programs did not perform as well on American Board of Surgery examinations and were considered less competent by their program directors. Consequently, this attempt to reduce the training period for general surgery was abandoned in order to maintain an output of competent, qualified surgeons. It is the College's view that the debate over financing graduate medical education should not be' allowed to lower the educational requirements for qualified surgeons, since the public is not well served by surgeons whose training is based on criteria other than educational requirements. Reductions in financial support for graduate medical education could also have adverse consequences for certain segments of the population. As 292 COGME has recognized in its principles, physician-to-population ratios often mask the diverse needs of particular geographic areas and disadvan- taged groups . Surgeons in training constitute a priceless national re- source that assures future high quality health care for all Americans. Moreover, surgeons in train.ing, al though not substituting for fully educat\u00ad ed surgeons, presently contribute to the clinical care that is provided in teaching hospitals. The College recognizes that decreased financial support for residency programs could hinder access of minorities and the economically disadvan\u00ad taged to graduate medical education. These individuals are known to incur larger medical school debts. Consequently, lower stipends or the imposi\u00ad tion of tuition fees could cause the financial burden of specialist train\u00ad ing to become so high that the underrepresentation of minorities in some specialties would be exacerbated. This is especially true for many of the surgical specialties, which often have extended residency requirements. Finally, before recommending any broad, across-the-board policy changes that could affect aggregate physician supply, COGME must consider their potential impact on specialties composed of relatively few physi\u00ad cians. Some of these specialties are just developing because of technolo\u00ad gical advances (e.g., Interventional Radiology); others are expanding as a result of newly identified needs (e.g., Aerospace Medicine and Occupational Medicine). In any event, the nation's health and access to care would not be served by policies which indiscriminately reduce the number of physi\u00ad cians across-the-board regardless of specialty. Manpower Issues Access to quality health care can only be assured if our nation's medical education system trains sufficient numbers of both generalists and 293 specialists. ACS recognizes that special public policies may be needed to address specific physician manpower problems. There have been projections of an impending oversupply of physicians. In particular, studies conducted years ago by the Graduate Medical Educa\u00ad tion National Advisory Cammi ttee ( of spe- cialists and an undersupply of primary care physicians. ACS believes strongly that these projections are grossly oversimplified and that they do not reflect the complicated patterns of today's health care delivery system. According to the ACS Longitudinal Study of Surgical Residents, which represents the most complete source of surgical resident data in the United Stat.es, the number of surgical residents in training shows no sign of increasing. In fact, the total number of surgical residents would have to increase by 18. 6 percent to reach GMENAC' s projection of 17, 000 surgical residents by 1990. Given current trends, it is likely that the difference between GMENAC' s projeqtions and the actual number of surgical residents will increase. As in the past, the College would be pleased to continue. to share with COGME the information provided by this comprehensive, ongoing study, which is currently in its sixth year. The College proposes that, for the purposes of assessing manpower supply and demand, the concept of \"primary care\" either be more clearly defined or dropped as a manpower designation. When the primary care desig\u00ad nation was first used about two decades ago, one of the principal assump\u00ad tions was that such care would be provided almost exclusively in ambulatory settings, and thus be less expensive than inpatient care. The current practice of defining only those services provided by general internists, family physicians, and general pediatricians as primary care does not take into account the true nature of care being provided by both generalists and 294 specialists. Largely because of new medical technologies, today's generalists and specialists are performing a growing number of services historically performed solely by each other. This overlap in the performance of ser\u00ad vices is compounded by the increased use of non-physician providers to perform many of the duties that were once performed solely by physicians. Consequently, distinctions based on traditional assumptions governing the practice of medicine have become less meaningful and may, in fact, be misleading. Further, because the databases used to determine the aggregate number of physicians by specialty have not been altered to reflect the multiple categories of work that any given physician performs, counts and therefore supply projections based on these totals are likely to also be misleading. To address these areas and develop accurate supply totals beyond certifica\u00ad tion the College encourages the development of a physician specialty database that adjusts for the time spent performing professional activities associated within each spe~ialty, i.e., full time equivalents (FTEs). A more accurate analysis of physician manpower would classify provid\u00ad ers into at least three major categories: 1) general internal medicine, family practice, and general pediatrics; 2) surgical specialties; and 3) \"other\" medical specialties. When these three groups are examined separ\u00ad ately, previously unobserved trends and concerns become evident. Compared to both primary care and \"other\" specialists, the proportion of the total physician\u00b7 population composed of surgeons has declined over the past 20 years, from 26.1 percent in 1965 to 23.1 percent in 1985. Similarly, the proportion of surgical residents has decreased substantially --from 40.2 percent of all filled residency positions in 1969-70 to 26.5 percent in 1986-87. By contrast, the percentage of residents in the 295 primary care specialties increased from 25.5 percent to 40.6 percent in the same period. Several features of graduate medical education are different for the surgical specialties than for the other specialties. First, there are unique lirni ting factors on the number of surgeons educated each year. Unlike other specialties, the Residency Review Committees for surgical special ties establish the number of training positions based-on clinical volume and the quality of the training program. Thus, the number of surgeons certified by their respective specialty boards has remained constant, or declined slightly in recent years. In a given year, the Surgical Specialty Boards will not accept for examination a number of candidates from each training program that exceeds this approved number. Specialties in general, other than surgical ones, have not used specific er i ter ia such as case volume, clinical resources, etc. , to determine the number of trainees The College also wishes to stress the importance of disaggregating, or examining individually, the specialties that compose the broad manpower category of \"surgical specialties\". A variety of factors influence some ' specialties more than others. Studies which lack sufficient detail ignore the unique supply and demand factors affecting individual surgical special- ties, and thus overlook our population's diverse and changing health care needs. Finally, the last category of physicians, \"other\" medical specialists, has been growing most rapidly from 30.9 percent of the physician popula- tion in 1965 to 41.9 percent in 1985 --and these physicians now compose the largest of the three physician manpower categories proposed by ACS. 296 The Changing Environment The growth of some of these \"other\" medical specialties illustrates the limits on our ability to predict future physician needs and supply. Our nation's health care system is dynamic and evolving. Factors affecting physician demand include: \u00b7the supply of foreign medical graduates, the growing number of female physicians and their practice arrangements, the increasing number of non-physician providers and their efforts to expand their scopes of practice, the emergence of alternative delivery systems, advances in technology, the aging population, the health care demands created by changing patterns in the incidence and prevalence of disease, and, of course, changes in methods of financing graduate medical education. Therefore, in keeping with COGME's principle to take systemwide changes into account, it would appear to us that earlier projections of physician supply should be re-evaluated in terms of the characteristics of today's health care system. Indeed, this may require a total re-evaluation of our.nation's manpower needs with regard to the present day system. This is especially true since GMENAC' s manpower projections were based on the health care system of a decade ago. Sharing Our Resources To preserve our nation's place in medical leadership and to demon\u00ad strate its concern for countries with fewer resources, ACS believes that the United States has an obligation to provide education and training for international scholars who will return to their countries of origin to become medical and surgical educators. Federal financial support should be available for graduates of schools approved by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME), as well as for a limited number of specially talented graduates from non-LCME approved schools whose abilities are 297 comparable to graduates of American medical schools. Conclusion The United States medical education and research systems, and the quality of our health care, are respected throughout the world. To pre\u00ad serve our excellence, this Council and the Congress must maintain a high level of commitment to the quality of the training our physicians receive. In its efforts to control costs and promote the efficient use of valuable health care resources, it is crucial that COGME remain sensitive to chang\u00ad ing patient needs and the potential adverse impact of any policies it may recommend. Reduced funding of graduate medical education, while attractive for immediate budget savings, may, in fact, increase total health care costs, since it is unlikely that less capable physicians will be able to practice medicine and surgery in as cost effective a manner. Mr. Chairman and COGME members, this concludes my formal presentation. The College stands ready to provide any assistance you may require as you review the important issues in your charge, and I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. Thank you. 110987CB.TST 298 Mr. Chairman and members of the Council, I am Fred Featherstone, M.D., Deputy Executive Director of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. The Academy appreciates this opportunity to share its views with you regarding the important matters of physician manpower and graduate medical education. One of the primary objectives of the Academy, as the voice for over 12,000 Board certified fellows, is to assure that patients have access to the best orthopaedic care possible. As such, we view the nation's graduate medical education system as a priceless national resource. It is to the health care system the equivalent of industry's investment in research and devel\u00ad opment and in capital facilities and technology. The COGME general principles and reports of its three sub\u00ad committees were reviewed recently by a multi-organizational orthopaedic group convened by the Academy. This group, the Council on Orthopaedic Graduate Medical Education, has repre\u00ad sentatives from the Academy, the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery, the Residency Review Committee for Orthopaedic Surge\u00b7ry, the Association of Orthopaedic Chairman, the American Orthopaedic Association, and the Council of Musculoskeletal Specialty Societies. On behalf of the orthopaedic community, 299 we wish to compliment COGME on its statement of principles which we agree with in general and on the open and thoughtful manner with which it is approaching its charter charges. We urge COGME to keep the principles visible and to use them as a litmus test for recommendations as they emerge from your subcommittees and as you frame your reports to the Congress. It would be easy to set them aside, as a task completed, and to ignore them in the pressure to fulfill one or another professional or political agenda that may emerge. In particular, the important principles 9 and 10 get to the heart of a quality and relevant health care delivery system capable of keeping American medicine in the forefront. For medical care in the next century will be only as good as the manpower we produce today --with in depth knowledge, special technical skills, adaptability and the capabi~ities of implementing the enormous technological and scientific advances that our biomedical research effort will deliver. It has taken this nation close to a hundred years and consumed the energies of thousands of educators, physicians, and policymakers to construct our undergraduate and graduate medical education system. It was not a mindless evolution but one compelled by the emerging sciences of medicine and the 300 environments in which it is practiced. This evolution is continuing today. With this in mind, we strongly support principle 5, but believe that only when comprehensive and valid data are analyzed, discussed and debated with the private sector should the Federal Government attempt to intervene or attempt to influence specialty mix and geographic distribution of physician manpower. There is evidence that market forces, as they have in the past, are influencing the medical education/medical practice equation. Decline in medical school applications, shifts of interest in specialty choice away from perceived \"over-supply\" or \"overly competitive\" specialties into areas previously less popular for U.S. medical graduates are occurring. Access to health care is being influenced by the emerging forms of \"managed care\" systems: such as HMO's with their multiple satellites; IPA's; hospital ambulatory care networks; and a variety of competitive medical plans. Furthermore, there is some evidence, and certainly a widely held perception, that a geographic redistribution of manpower is.occurring with an increasing number of smaller communities attracting physicians of all types. The current system is dynamic, evolution is occurring, for there are many forces at work and a lot is happening out there. We should be patient and be sure that our actions do no harm. The Academy is currently studying these trends and should have data for orthopaedics in late 1988. 301 There is another dimension of the access issue which relates to the availability and characteristics of the profes\u00ad sional entry point for first contact care --primary care -\u00ad and follow-up care. While it might be simplier or convenient to ignore the actual and logical contribution which surgical and medical specialists make to the initial care or primary care equation, it would be unwise to do so. With an increasingly educated population, patients as informed con\u00ad sumers can, do, and should select their entry point into the health care system and their sources of continuing care. Patients more often than not make wise choices. The sum of all this type of specialty care is often overlooked by the policy analysts and policymakers. The orthopaedic community is sensitive to COGME concerns regarding the overall costs of GME, the relationship of service to education, and the content and length of specialty train\u00ad ing. However, the constituted bodies of organized medicine have the responsibility to assure the highest quality educa\u00ad tional experience necessary to provide the nation with com\u00ad petent skilled specialists. The American Board of Medical Specialties and the Advisory Council on Graduate Medical Education should have the authority to control the content of and length of residency education rather than any single entity. We agree that educational quality should not be 302 compromised by a high volume of services. In fact, the Residency Review Committee for Orthopaedic Surgery documented that the most common reason for probation was the negative impact of excessive service demands on the education environ\u00ad ment. Orthopaedic surgery is an extremely broad specialty. Musuloskeletal complaints and disorders are the most frequent cause of ambulatory physician visits and among the most common hospital discharge diagnoses. The specialty includes primary, secondary, and tertiary care in ways that few other specialties do. Orthopaedists treat children, active adults, and the aged. Their practices blend medical musculoskeletal care with surgical care in approximately equal proportions, with half their practice being off ice patient care. Estimates of surgi\u00ad cal to nonsurgical patient encounters range from 1:10 to 1:20 for 85% of all orthopaedists who declare themselves as general orthopaedic surgeons. Advances in the management of degenerative joint disease, joint replacement, arthroscopic diagnostic and surgical treat\u00ad ment for internal joint disease and trauma, and advances in spine surgery all have revolutionized the specialty of orthopaedics in the last 30 years. These advances have significantly altered the practice of, and demand for, 303 orthopaedic specialty care. What of the future? * . . As our population ages, a concomitant increase in fractures and degenerative disease will occur -\u00ad increasing demand for medical and surgical care of musculoskeletal disorders. New knowledge and technology will emerge. * Changes in the health care delivery system such as: * new technology * demand for lower length of hospital stay * increased use of ambulatory surgical facilities * the requirement that the history and physical and other laboratory work up be performed in an ambulatory setting prior to surgical admission will place additional stress on the educator, the resident and the curriculum content. Our society must ensure that adequate resources are avail\u00ad able to support the total educational experience wherever it is conducted, i.e., in-'hospital or an ambulatory setting. 304 COGME has a unique opportunity. It could be a strong advocate for the finest graduate education system in the world. It can be an organized point in the policy process which emphasizes and defends quality the positives in our system. It has the opportunity by virtue of its charter to take the long and scholarly view and not fall victim to the quick fix syndrome. We in the orthopaedic community are prepared to assist you in your deliberations and to provide you with such information we may have that would be helpful. 305 Average Percentage of Cases Treated Based on Anatomical Site, Disease Category and Age of Patient Anatomical Site Knee/Leg Thoracic/Lumbar Spine Pelvis/Hip/Thigh Foot/Ankle Hand/Forearm Shoulder/Elbow Non-localized Disease Degenerative/Rheumatoid Congenital Developmental Neurological Infection Other Metabolic Neoplastic Vascular (Circulatory) 19 years and older 18 years and younger NR = 26 306 Percentage of Cases Mean 21.7 18.1 14.2 12.3 12.0 9.7 7.5 3.1 42.3 25.7 8.2 7.6 3.6 3.4 2.6 2.3 2.3 71. 0 28.2 Mr. Chairman and distinguished Council members, I am Carolyn Rabinowitz, M.D., Deputy Medical Director of the American Psychiatric Association, a medical specialty society representing more than 34,000 psychiatrists nationwide. In addition to the practice of general and child psychiatry, I have spent much of my career in graduate medical education. I am a Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at George Washington University School of Medicine, Immediate-Past President of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, and former Director of the APA Off ice of Education. The nature of psychiatric care and training has changed markedly over the past two decades. Scientific approaches to diagnosis, new forms of psychotherapeutic intervention, and a greater and more specific armamentarium of pharmacologic agents have all resulted in more efficacious, cost-effective treatment which in many cases reduces the use of other medical services. The number and quality of U.S. medical students entering psychiatry has increased, and the stigma associated with psychiatric disorders, although still present, is diminishing. It is ironic that these advances are coupled with current and proposed restraints that can hamper the advances in clinical care. Our trainees are a national resource who can transfer this new knowledge into practice. My testimony today will focus on three areas: the supply of psychiatrists; financing of graduate medical education; and previously noted issues related to foreign medical graduates. 307 5upply of Psychiatrists For a decade, evidence has shown that psychiatrists are in short supply. Numerous studies including those done by the Heritage Foundation, the Rand Corporation, and the DHHS Report of the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) have specifically identified both general psychiatry and child psychiatry to be in a condition of national shortage. In fact, the GMENAC report projected a shortage of between 3,900 and 5,900 child psychiatrists and 8,500 general psychiatrists in 1990, and these estimates were based on minimal use of psychiatrists' non-substitutable services. Within this section, an overview of the numbers of psychiatrists including trainees is detailed along with the reasons why additional psychiatrists may be needed in the future. As of September 1, 1986, there were 209 accredited training programs in general psychiatry and 126 training programs in child psychiatry. There were 4,892 general psychiatry and 602 child psychiatry residents on duty on that date. General psychiatry residents comprised 6.2% of all residents in training. Although the numbers of trainees have increased in recent years, there are still gaps in the care delivery system that lead to a need for additional psychiatrists. In particular, additional trainees are especially needed in and for child psychiatry, geriatric psychiatry, substance abuse disorders, care of the most seriously and chronically mentally ill, and psychiatric 309 research. Psychiatry has actively recruited minorities and women. While 38% of our current residents are female, a recent survey demonstrated that only 1% of senior minority medical students planned to enter psychiatry. According to AMA and APA projections and data, there are over 34,000 psychiatrists of whom about ten percent self-designate as child psychiatrists. Chronic mental illness accounts for the use of up to 25% of all hospital beds. It is estimated that between 12 and 15%, or 7.5 million to 9.5 million of our approximately 63 million children under age 18 suffer from mental disorders that warrant intervention, but less then 1% receive treatment in a hospital or residential treatment facility and approximately 5% or 2 million receive outpatient mental health treatment. Among the 25 million Americans over age 65, some 15-20%, or 3 to 5 million, have significant mental health problems. Moreover, in 1982, persons over age 65 accounted for just over 10% of the U.S. population, but 17% of deaths by suicide. Despite the mental health needs of the elderly, they receive only 6% of community mental health services and 2% of private psychiatric services. As the number of elderly persons increases so will the needs for services. Studies based on the needs of the population or current utilization trends have documented the continued undersupply of psychiatrists. One recent article by Yager and Borus, based on one side of a debate, 310 suggested we are training enough or too many psychiatrists. Both some of the data and arguments presented by the authors are flawed. No matter what data are used, evidence indicates that approximately 15% of the population at some point in time will suffer from mental disorders serious enough to warrant psychiatric intervention. There are not enough psychiatrists to meet the multiple needs of the seriously and chronically mentally ill population. Many psychiatric hospitals and ambulatory care settings, including those in the private sector, have difficulty filling psychiatric positions. Access to and demand for psychiatric care has been adversely affected by inadequate reimbursement for service delivery as well as the stigma associated with seeking such care. Psychiatric shortage areas continue to be identified in both rural and urban areas, especially inner cities. The recruitment of additional trainees in'child psychiatry is a top priority. Training of all psychiatrists is labor intensive and takes place primarily in ambulatory settings, but the training of child psychiatrists is even more so. Psychiatrists specializing in the care of children and adolescents must be familiar with neurobiological and neurodevelopmental issues, approaches to prevention, as well as psychosocial, sociocultural, and educational factors. Individuals with substance abuse disorders, both singly and combined with other mental disorders (dual diagnoses), need complex medical treatment and thus, psychiatric care. 31] Although the development of physician scientists is a problem for all of medicine, the problem is more acute in psychiatry. NIH studies indicate that researchers need a post residency fellowship of at least two years. Given the massive growth in psychiatric research, funding for research training will have a major impact on the type and quality of care. We must continue to recruit psychiatrists into research careers. Psychiatrists are the only health or mental health professionals who can bridge and integrate the neurobiological and psychosocial aspects of development and illness. Their evaluative, differential diagnostic, and treatment planning skills cannot be duplicated. No other group of care providers is willing or able to undertake care for the most seriously mentally ill members of our society. Financing Graduate Medical F.ducation Since the inception of the Medicare program, the Congress has maintained a strong commitment to financing graduate medical education. As hospitals and the Federal government have faced financial difficulties, the trend has been to finance part of graduate medical education or departmental activities through clinical practice income. If this trend continues, it poses some very difficult dilemmas for all medical educators and for psychiatry in particular. Just as we are at 312 the cutting edge of a new era in the science of understanding mental illness, our teachers and researchers are forced to see more and more patients and possibly neglect both the labor-intensive teaching of psychiatry and their own research. As one of the lowest paying specialties with a heavy ambulatory focus, the amount of income that psychiatrists can generate from clinical practice is minimal compared to more technologically-oriented specialties. Any attempts to cut back funding for graduate medical education can seriously hinder psychiatry's efforts to recruit top trainees and may add to existing disincentives. Some of these disincentives affect all of medicine, and some are specific to our field. The current medical school graduate is likely to leave school with over $30,000 worth of debt (an increase of over 100% since 1980). In order to meet this debt load, the student may either choose a high paying specialty or may choose to forego subspecialty training in order to begin repaying loans at an earlier date. Thus, some individuals interested in specializing in child or geriatric psychiatry, may avoid subspecialization in order to begin loan repayment earlier. Furthermore, psychiatry is among the lowest paid clinical specialties, in part, because so many psychiatrists work in salaried public sector positions. In addition to high debt loads, psychiatric trainees are faced with the fact that coverage for psychiatric care is limited and discourages 313 individuals in need from seeking care. For instance, the Medicare program currently reimburses a beneficiary no more than $250 (after copayment) annually for outpatient psychiatric care and inpatient hospitalization in a psychiatric hospital is limited to 190 days per a beneficiary's lifetime. In 1984, only 8% of 300 companies provided coverage for both in-and outpatient psychiatric care equivalent to that for all other physical illnesses. At that time, only 48% of privately insured and employed patients had coverage for inpatient treatment for mental illness equivalent to that for other physical illnesses (down from 58% in 1981) and only 7% (down from 10% in 1981) had outpatient mental health coverage that was the same as for other illnesses. While budgetary constraints require a reexamination of Medicare's financing of graduate medical education, it is our hope that further disincentives to entry into psychiatry will not be put in place. In fact, we recommend that alternative methods of financing graduate medical education should give special note to trainees who can meet the needs of the population with mental disorders. Foreign ltedical Graduates APA previously testified before the COGME Subcommittee on Foreign Medical Graduates, and I will briefly summarize our statements._ As you know, not enough American medical graduates have entered psychiatry to meet the mental health needs of our population. In addition, our country has a moral obligation and responsibility to support FMG 314 physicians who are currently in the system either by virtue of being residents or in practice. FMGs have also provided a great deal of service, both during and after training, to underserved patients, often from lower income levels, in government hospitals. Any abrupt disruptions to the system would seriously impair service delivery to our most ill patients. Finally, psychiatrists have always felt an obligation to promote international scholarship through the exchange of professors, practitioners, and students, and through the maintainence of a major role in the dissemination of new knowledge. Sumnary In sum, />J?A appreciates the significant task facing the Council. We ' are a specialty in short supply and feel that special attention nrust be paid to the needs of the population who warrant psychiatric intervention. Ttirough scientific advances in the understanding of the physiological bases and concomitants of mental disorders, the stigma associated with these disorders has been reduced. only if the Federal commitment to financing graduate medical education remains, can the appropriate number of psychiatrists be trained to meet the mental health needs of the population and the special needs of our very young and older populations. 315 November 16, 1987 The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry appreciates the opportunity to appear at this public hearing and submit information and recommendations to the Council on Graduate Medical Education regarding the status of child and adolescent psychiatry as a medical subspecialty. The forthcoming recommendations of the Council to the Congress and the Executive Branch regarding medicine's subspecialty with the severest personnel needs can influence the scope and direction of our medical education for many years. I. Shortage of Child and Adolescent Psychiatrists. Currently, child and adolescent psychiatry finds itself in a difficult position because of the great shortage of professionals in this speciality, the pending removal of support systems that would permit growth, and a prevalence rate for emotional disturbances in children and adolescents of over 11 percent, many of whom are not appropriately identified or treated. In 1980, the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee concluded that there would be 70,000 more physicians in this country than required in this country by 1990, with most specialties having a surplus of professionals; however, child psychiatry was noted as a subspecialty experiencing the greatest shortage --a shortage that would likely continue through 1990. In 1980 there were approximately 2500 child and adolescent 317 psychiatrists practicing across the country when the Advisory Committee recommended a range of 8,000 to 10,000 child psychiatrists would be required by 1990. This recommendation was not the original finding through converting service requirements into total professionals needed. That estimate was 26,000 child and adolescent psychiatrists --an estimate that had to be radically adjusted because of near impossibility of realizing such a number of professionals in the even next 50 years. Even the Advisory Committee's revised recommendation calling for only a three-fold increase was based on a prevalence rate of 8.6, which is much lower than the usually accepted 11.8 percent. In 1987, the number of child and adolescent psychiatrists is estimated at 4,000. The American Medical Association's most recent distribution tables (1986 edition) show 3,709 non-federal child and adolescent psychiatrists and 74 federal child and adolescent psychiatrists. The major professional activities for these physicians are divided as foYlowes: 2,281 in office-based practice 575 on full-time physician staff 130 involved in medical teaching 246 in administration 309 doing research The addition of 1500 child and adolescent psychiatrists since 1980 is encouraging, but the need still far outreaches any realistic projection of growth. The number of residents in child psychiatry has grown steadily --from 537 in 1984, to 580 in 1985, and 602 in 1986 --with the number of training programs 318 remaining around 123. Ninety-six of the approved training programs are in medical schools and the rest in approved hospitals. Many of the training programs (exact number unknown) are linked to state hospitals to provide additional support to the state staff. The training programs are in 41 states plus the District of Columbia and in two Army base hospitals. In 1984, the training programs had a capacity to train 665 child psychiatrists, but only 537 residents were in the two year program. With 128 \"open\" slots, child psychiatry was using only 80 percent of its training slots. This compares with general psychiatry at 91 percent, pediatrics at 96 percent and family practice at 95 percent. The number of residents has increased to over 600; however, the openings are still greater than the number of trainees. Another secondary influence on the shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists was revealed when a 1985 survey showed 84 percent of medical schools needing additional faculty for child psychiatry programs. Fifty-one training programs had a total of 80 faculty vacancies. That same survey found that eleven of the medical schools with accredited child psychiatry programs either are or very shortly will be searching for a new \"chief\" of psychiatry. In order to ease the shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists, training in child and adolescent psychiatry must be outlined. Beyond the four years of medical school, child and adolescent psychiatric training requires 1 year of supervised hospital medical training (internship), 3 years of approved 319 residency training in general psychiatry with adults, and 2 years of training in psychiatric work with children, adolescents and their families in an approved residency in child and adolescent psychiatry. In the general psychiatry training years, the resident achieves competence in the basics of psychiatric work. In the child and adolescent psychiatry residency, the child fellow acquires a thorough knowledge of normal child and family development, as well as psychopathology, and treatment. Special importance is given to disorders that appear in childhood, such as p~rvasive developmental disorder, learning disability, mental retardation, depression, drug dependency and delinquency. The child psychiatry resident further applies and develops psychiatric skills by treating youngsters and their families. The evaluation and treatment of inpatients and outpatients is important throughout the residency, with a concentration on delivery of appropriate treatment within the family's financial and psychological means. This training includes supervised experience with children of all ages and from all socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds, in long-term psychodynamic therapy, as well as shorter-term interventions, through individual, conjoint or family treatment. The training with hospitalized children and adolescentss provides the preparation for full hospital admission and treatment privileges. Having completed the child psychiatry residency and successfully passed the examination in general psychiatry given by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, the child psychiatrist is eligible for certification in the subspecialty of 320 child and adolescent psychiatry. Although these last two examinations are not required for practice, they are further assurance that the child and adolescent psychiatrists who are trained and certified in this way can be expected to dia,gnose and treat all psychiatric conditions of patients of any age, or refer them for such treatment. II. Federal Policies Influencing Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Three federal programs currently influence the numbers of child and adolescent psychiatrists in the country. Policies supporting the continuation or expansion of these programs can move the specialty away from its shortage status. The Graduate Medical Education program, which allows direct payments for salaries under Medicare, now includes funding for the fifth year of training, but this fifth year has come under Congressional attack --after the previous removal of the sixth and seventh years of funding for specialty training. Without the support of the Medicare direct payments, the extended training needed for child and adolescents will become too expensive to choose as a specialty. The fifth year of funding should be supported as a means to encourage more child and adolescent psychiatry trainees. The National Health Service Corps, within the Health Services and Resources Administration, has provided funding for the training of child and adolescent psychiatrists. And, although proposals to eliminate the Corps have been defeated in recent months, there is another ongoing problem with the distribution of NHSC trained child psychiatrists after training. 321 It has been reported by NHSC trainees that the placement policies requiring their locating in specific priority sites after training kept them from treating children and adolescents. This waste of specialty training during the four year post\u00ad training obligation is of great concern, primarily because there are children and adolescents to be treated in each of the priority areas --the high priority rural areas, the rural areas near urban centers, and in the urban sites which have an undersupply of physicians. In the past, it has been possible to place child and adolescent psychiatrists in sites where they can practice their specialty by approaching the local officials one\u00ad on-one and securing a request for placement from them. In recent correspondence with the NHSC officials, assurances are given that in the 1987 placement cycle, where there were 96 obligated psychiatrists --26 of whom are child psychiatrists, there are 24 child p~ychiatry sites and 2 sites suitable for either child psychiatry or general psychiatry. The assurance is given that NHSC intends to continue its policy of placing child psychiatrists in their specific field, but since this \"policy\" is barely into its first cycle, it would be reassuring to be able to provide trainees with the secure knowlege that the battle for placement will not have to be staged every cycle and that they will be able to treat children and adolescents as part of their NHSC obligation. A final area of concern in the federal support for training child and adolescent psychiatrists is the cliriical training program within the National Institute of Mental Health. 322 The appropriations amounts for clinical training have diminished from over $100 million a few years ago to $15 million in FY 1987. These funds are distributed not just to child psychiatry training programs but to a range of mental health professionals. Currently, NIMH can support only 80 of 200 clinical training grants in the priority area of child and adolescent mental health. Of the $15 million appropriated for clinical training in FY 1987, about $1,976,881 is spent on children's programs, down from $3,051,411 in FY 1986. Of the 1987 funds, child psychiatry received only $840,240 --enough for a few child faculty development grants. It should be emphasized that funds supporting training programs in child and adolescent psychiatry are used to support faculty, not individual trainee stipends. While the emphasis of this testimony has been on the need for more trained child and adolescent psychiatrists, this faculty support plays an important part in securing the appropriate education for child and adolescent psychiatrists, as well as having a major multiplier effect in the benefits generated by contributing to the education of mental health professionals through child and adolescent psychiatry faculty members. Support for the NIMH clinical training program's continuence and return to more significant funding would encourage expanded, effective training programs: o by attracting and supporting additional treaching faculty, 0 0 by developing improved and expanded educational programs able to attract new students, by increasing faculty support for minority 323 programs, and programs with increased emphasis on chronic mental illness, o by improving consultation/liaison activities with primarY care physicians and other mental health professionals, o by allowing the addition of new programs on day treatment, family therapy, and chronic menal illness. Loss of support for clinical training would result in: o decreased services to populations served by subsidized training programs, o a decrease in the quality and quantity of training, o a limit to new programs and problems with trainee recruitment, o a fragmentation of faculty and loss of faculty time for evaluation, o a fragmentation of faculty and loss of .faculty time for evaluation, 0 0 a loss of emphasis on the underserved, children and the aging, with specific losses in outreach programs, and a major loss of support when states do not have the encouragement to add their support to clinical training programs. When the federal government provides some assistance for a program, even if the support is a minor part of 324 the total budget, a state and community are far more willing to share the costs. Clinical training support is an investment whose benefits can be multipled with greater Federal support. III. Support for Federal Funding of Data Gathering for Child and Adolescent Mental Health care. In the Office of Technology Assessment's 1986 Background Paper, Children's Mental Health: Probles and Services, one of the first conclusions are put forward concerns the need for more data on children's mental health and the services that are available, the needs are explained as follows: A major difficulty in development of this background paper and in designing more effective children mental health progrmas was the lack of data on many treatment regimens and service systems. Although NIMH commits approximately 20 percent of its current research budget to children's issues, available dollars have not kept pace with assessments of the funds necessary. Most mental health care interventions are appropriate for evaluation studies --and most could benefit from the information that research provides. In addition, basic information about the characteristics and utilization of the contemporary mental health service system is not available. The financial savings from a more comprehensive database are potentially enormous; the benefits to children and society of more effective programs are incalculable. Their analysis suggests several needs related to children's mental illnesses and services: Two specific needs include a, \"more informed estimate of the number of children who require mental health services, and a description of the availablility and use of children's mental health services.\" IV. Suil1I!lary of Recoil1I!lendations. In summary, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 325 ~sychiatry urges the Council on Gradate Medical Education to communicate and recommend to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, the senate Finance committee, and the House Energy and Commerce and Ways and Means Committees the following: 1. Child and adolescent psychiatry is not an oversupplied medical subspecialty. It is a subspecialty with a shortage of professionals. 2. Training for child and adolescent psychiatry requires at least five years beyond medical school; therefore, in order to correct the shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists, support for training programs should be provided by the federal government. 3. Federal support can be encouraged through the continuation of Medicare's direct payment for the fifth year of specialty training under its Graduate Medical Education program. 4. A written National Health Service Corps policy should be adopted requiring the placing of Corps-trained child and adolescent psychiatrists in sites that allow the treating of children and adolescents. 5. The clinical training program through the National Institute of Mental Health should be enhanced so that the unmet needs of psychiatrically ill children and adolescents are adequately addressed. 6. Data collection regarding the prevalence and utilization of psychiatric services by children and adolescents, as well as the availability of those services, should be 326 begun as soon as possible. Longitudinal studies of the the screening, evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of children have been an ongoing recommendation, and the federal government should assist in the funding. There is little doubt these studies will direct resources toward the treatments that are effective and, thus, cost effective. Thank you for this opportunity to testify before the council. If you have any questions or requests regarding these recommendations, please contact the Academy's Central Office. 327 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Council, my name is Jacek Franaszek, M.D. I am a board certified emergency physician and currently practice In Chicago, Illinois. I am president-elect of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the national specialty society for emergency physicians. The College appreciates having this opportunity to testify on behalf of our membership before this Council on Graduate Medical Education. Mr. Chairman, we are here today to address three major points: 1 Unlike medicine in the aggregate, emergency medicine is not experiencing a surplus of physicians but, is in fact experiencing a severe shortage. 2. Moreover, this shortage will not be reduced through current residency training output and, therefore; 3. National resources must be focused on addressing this shortage. Please permit me to elaborate. Less than two decades ago emergency departments in this country were staffed by house officers or physicians who drew their shift to work in what was termed the \"pit.\" Most were ill-equipped to appropriately handle the wide variety of patient problems that presented to the emergency department. Nor were many of these physicians sufficiently trained to stabilize and resuscitate patients who presented with life-and limb-threatening emergencies. In response to the public demand for more adequate treatment in emergency departments, the specialty of emergency medicine evolved. In 1968 a group of physicians interested in promoting quality patient care in emergency medicine formed the American College of Emergency Physicians. The College, grew from 400 members that year to over 11 , 600 members today. A fundamental goal of the College has always been the provision of excellent emergency care and emergency services to those in need. The College realized that in order for the specialty to grow, and for services to improve, the establishment of training programs was needed. Accordingly, the first residency. training program was developed in 1970 at the University of Cincinnati. Today there are 73 programs graduating over 430 residents per year. The College also supported the formation of the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM) and worked to create a certifying examination for the specialty. That board was officially recognized by the American_ Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) in 1979 and emergency medicine became the twenty-third specialty within the house of medicine. The American College of Emergency Physicians believes that ideally every patient needing emergency care should have the opportunity to be treated by a board certified emergency physician, at least primarily. This belief is shared by the hundreds of hospitals across the nation that advertise monthly for board certified emergency physicians to staff their emergency departments. Many of these positions remain staffed by physicians in other specialties because of the shortage in numbers of adequately prepared emergency physicians. Therefore, the ideal cannot 329 Page Two be currently realized. The Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) report of 1980 predicted a shortage of emergency physicians by 1990. Based on these data, data from the American Medical Association Center for Health Policy Research, our own data relative to residency training production, and the number of physicians certified by the American Board of Emergency Medicine, the American College of Emergency Physicians believes the shortage of certified emergency physicians will persist well into the next century. Parenthetically, the shortage also exists in military medicine, where large numbers of emergency medicine slots remain unfilled. Indeed, it is commonplace for the military to contract with civilian emergency physician groups to provide emergency care to their personnel. The current demand for board certified emergency physicians is, at the very least, 14, 000 physicians (excluding the military's demand for emergency physicians). This demand is illustrated by the following data: Currently, emergency departments receive approximately 80 million patient visits per year, although this number is probably an underestimate. However, utilizing the figure of 80 million yearly visits and assuming that each physician will see 2. 7 patients per hour for an average of 45 hours per week 47 weeks per year, one arrives at the figure of 14, 000 physicians. These data are extrapolated from a study conducted for the College by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. as well as data from the National Opinion Research Corporation. As of September 1987 there were only 5, 840 board certified emergency physicians to meet this demand. When emergency medicine first became a recognized specialty, there were two main routes to becoming credentialed in order to take the board examination: the residency training route and the practice eligible route. The latter consisted of those individuals who had practiced five years in emergency medicine and at least two years of consecutive full time practice in the specialty. In 1988, the practice eligible route to credentialing will cease, thus ending a resource to reduce the manpower shortage in emergency medicine. The discontinuation of the practice eligible route was a condition of becoming a specialty in 1979. After 1988, therefore, the only route to board certification will be residency training. Given the rate of residency output, the current shortage will only get worse. As mentioned, there are presently 73 residency training programs in. the United States producing 430 residency trained graduates per year. Both the number of residency training programs and the number of residents trained per year have remained fairly stable over the past five years despite a continuously rising demand for those slots. Last year over 3, 000 applicants competed for 430 open residency slots in emergency medicine. Because academic emergency medicine is a recent development compared to other academic units within the medical school and because the current contemplated reduction of federal funding for graduate medical education, there is no reason to assume that the number of training programs nor the number of positions will grow without necessary support. 330 Page Three The problem of inadequate numbers of residency training slots in emergency medicine is worsened by the fact that there will be an insufficient number of appropriately trained faculty to staff new positions, were they even to exist. The competition for faculty becomes very keen when there is a shortage of certified physicians, .. and particularly so in the academic sector. Should academia recruit emergency medicine faculty from the private sector, a further manpower shortage will ensue; this despite the use of many emergency medicine programs of specialists in other disciplines to augment their faculty. Those programs which applied for and were denied accreditation by the Residency Review Committee for Emergency Medicine were consistently cited for failing to have a sufficient number of appropriately trained and qualified faculty on their staff. The current demand far exceeds current supply --and the demand is ever increasing. Where do old people go when they are sick? Who sees patients when their own physicians are unavailable? Who is required by law and the tenets of their specialty to see patients when no one else will? Who responds to disaster situations? Who provides ambulatory care to many who lack access to it elsewhere? In my own practice I am seeing increasing numbers of obstetrical and other patients in the emergency department who are uninsured and thus have been refused care by alternative providers. Emergency medicine constitutes a fail-safe mechanism for access to the healthcare system for many that otherwise would not have access to it. And this population of patients continues to rise in number. Although our specialty was started by second career physicians, it is common for first career new generation emergency physicians to diversify their practice. This diversification is taking place in response to clinical services for which there is a great nee,d. Accordingly, it is not unusual for emergency medicine, though predoniinately practiced in hospital based settings, to extend beyond the hospital setting into ambulatory care facilities, industrial medicine clinics, poison control centers, and sports medicine clinics. Because of its unique 24-hour a day availability, the hallmark of the specialty is to provide patient services such as critical care in addition to staffing the emergency department. Many emergency physicians are also involved in non-clinical aspects of medicine including hospital administration, teaching, and most particularly medical administration and the instruction of paramedical personnel in the pre-hospital care system. A large unknown relative to supply is the rate of attrition from the specialty. The American Medical Association predicts that the average attrition rate of physicians in general is roughly 2-3%. It is uncertain whether this figure can be accurately extrapolated to emergency medicine. There are many reasons to believe that it does not. Emergency medicine is a physically demanding specialty that requires long working hours of great intensity. Emergency physicians are constantly facing critical decisions under a great deal of pressure, sometimes without the benefit of complete information about any given patient. Since emergency physicians constantly work different shifts, their circadian rhythms are consistently disrupted. The demands of around the clock practice make a shorter 331 Page Four practice lifetime reasonable to assume. With more emergency physicians leaving practice, the demand to replace them will increase. Thus, without sufficient provision for training an adequate number of new emergency physicians, the projected shortage will increase even further. The American College of Emergency Physicians believes that quality patient care demands that patients be seen by appropriately trained and board certified emergency physicians. Given present trends, the demands for certified emergency physicians will continue to far exceed the supply. Therefore, the American College of Emergency Physicians urges the Council to request that national resources be refocused on creating appropriate training slots to meet this shortage in our specialty. Moreover, the Council is urged to recommend that there be sufficient number of appropriately qualified faculty to train emergency physicians and other physicians in training in ambulatory care in the emergency \u00b7department setting. Emergency medicine is a recognized specialty. As with other specialties, emergency medicine requires appropriate residency training to adequately develop the skills necessary to practice competently. Solutions must focus on ways for expanding and promoting quality graduate medical eduClltion as a remedy for the current and future shortage of duly qualified emergency physicians. Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the College and its membership, I appreciate this &pportunity to testify before the Council and am prepared to answer any questions. Thank you. 332 GOOD MORNING, I AM DR. TERENCE COLLINS, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF COMMUNITY MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. I AM ALSO VICE CHAIRMAN FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE OF THE AMERICAN BOARD OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND CHAIRMAN OF THE RESIDENCY REVIEW COMMITTEE FOR PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. I AM TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, THE NATIONAL SPECIALTY SOCIETY FOR THE FIELD. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IS UNIQUE AMONG MEDICAL SPECIAL TIES BECAUSE OF ITS FOCUS ON GROUPS OF PEOPLE AND ON HEALTH RATHER THAN DISEASE. THE FIELD, WHICH ENCOMPASSES GENERAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE, PUBLIC HEALTH, OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE, AND AEROSPACE MEDICINE, IS CHANGING. THE CHANGES REFLECT INCREASING EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PROGRAMS WITH A STRONG EPIDEMIOLOGIC RESEARCH BASE, STUDENT INTEREST AND MARKET DEMANDS. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IS THE SPECIALTY WHICH CAN HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OF OUR NATION AND IS WELL EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH PRESENT AND FUTURE CHALLENGES SUCH AS AIDS AND MAJOR ENVIRONMENT AL ISSUES. IT IS THE SPECIAL TY MOST CLOSELY IDENTIFIED WITH THE PREVENTION OF DISEASE AND THE PROMOTION OF HEAL TH AT BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE POPULATION LEVELS. THERE ARE 70 TRAINING PROGRAMS IN PREVENTIVE MEDICINE: 29., GENERAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE; 5, GENERAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE/PUBLIC HEALTH; 9, PUBLIC HEALTH; 24, OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE AND 3, AEROSPACE MEDICINE. THE FIRST POSTGRADUATE OR CLINICAL YEAR OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINING IS USUALLY OBTAINED IN OTHER PRIMARY CARE/CLINICAL DEPARTMENTS. THE PGY 2 OR ACADEMIC YEAR LEADS TO A MASTER'S OF PUBLIC HEALTH OR EQUIVALENT DEGREE, AND IS INTEGRATED WITH OR 333 FOLLOWED BY A PRACTICUM YEAR OF TRAINING PROVIDED IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS, DEPENDING ON THE SPECIALTY. PRACTICUM TRAINING INCLUDES BOTH DIDACTIC AND CLINICAL COMPONENTS. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE CORE DISCIPLINES ARE EPIDEMIOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS, OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENT AL MEDICINE, BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE, HEAL TH ADMINISTRATION AND CLINICAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. THE APPROXIMATELY 6,000 PHYSICIAN SPECIALISTS WORKING IN THIS FIELD ARE FOUND IN MANY DIFFERENT SETTINGS WHERE THEY FREQUENTLY OCCUPY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS: IN HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, UNIVERSITIES, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INDUSTRY, HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS AND CLINICS. THE PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES OF MANY PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PHYSICIANS ARE FOCUSED ON AMBULATORY CARE. SURVEYS HAVE SHOWN THAT 70% OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PHYSICIANS SPEND AT LEAST SOME TIME PERFORMING CLINICAL ACTIVITIES. IT JS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT MANY OF THESE SPECIALISTS ARE DOUBLE-BOARDED: ALREADY BOARDED JN A CLINICAL SPECIALTY, THEY HAVE FELT THE NEED TO COMPLEMENT THEIR TRAINING WITH TRAINING AND BOARD CERTIFICATION IN PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. SPECIALISTS .,-, IN PREVENTIVE MEDICINE ARE UNIQUELY PREPARED TO PLAY KEY ROLES IN PROVIDING MEDICAL CARE FOR THE INDIGENT, BOTH IN PROGRAM PLANNING, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AND ALSO IN THE DIRECT PROVISION OF CLINICAL CARE. THE GMENAC STUDY PREDICTED A 25% SHORTAGE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE SPECIALISTS AND DID NOT VIEW PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AS A CLINICAL SPECIAL TY. WHEN YOU VIEW PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AS A CLINICAL SPECIAL TY, AS I DO, IT JS QUITE CLEAR THAT THE SHORTAGE WILL BE EVEN GREATER. THERE HAS BEEN NO INCREASE JN THE NUMBER OF TRAINING PROGRAMS SINCE 334 1981, AL THOUGH THE CHARACTER OF THE PROGRAMS HAS CHANGED WITH MORE EMPHASIS ON CLINICAL ASPECTS AND OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE. THERE HAS BEEN NO NET INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SPECIALISTS CERTIFIED ANNUALLY SINCE 1982 WHEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND GENERAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE WERE COMBINED INTO A SINGLE EXAMINATION ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN BOARD OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. THIS BOARD CERTIFIES ABOUT 150 PHYSICIANS A YEAR. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN RESIDENTS FROM 362 IN 1980 TO 511 AS OF SEPTEMBER l, 1987. THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED APPLICANTS IS ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE NUMBER OF TRAINING POSITIONS AVAILABLE. FOR RESIDENTS COMPLETING THEIR TRAINING, THE SHORT AGE IS IMMEDIATELY OBVIOUS BECAUSE MULTIPLE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES ARE USUALLY AVAILABLE. AN IMPORTANT AREA OF INTEREST RELATES TO THE EDUCATION OF INTERNATIONAL PHYSICIANS AND PARTICULARLY TO THE INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL SCHOLARS PROGRAM. THE UNITED STATES PROVIDES THE PREMIER TRAINING IN PUBLIC HEAL TH AND PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IN THE WORLD. IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF SOCIETY IN GENERAL THAT WE EDUCATE FOREIGN SPECIALISTS TO GO BACK TO WORK IN THEIR COUNTRIES WHERE THE MAJOR HEAL TH CARE NEEDS OF THE WORLD HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WHERE THE SOLUTIONS FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. A MECHANISM IS NEEDED TO INCORPORATE INTO OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS THESE INTERNATIONAL PHYSICIANS AND FUNDING MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE. ALTHOUGH, AT TIMES, FUNDING CAN BE PROVIDED BY THE HOME COUNTRY, AREAS OF GREATEST NEED FREQUENTLY HAVE THE FEWEST RESOURCES. ADDITIONALLY, A CERTIFICATION MECHANISM IS NEEDED FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT MANY U.S. PHYSICIANS RECEIVE EXCELLENT TRAINING IN INTERNATIONAL HEALTH THROUGH OUR 335 PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS. THE LAST MAJOR ISSUE I WISH TO ADDRESS RELATES TO FINANCING OF PROGRAMS. THE MAJOR REASON PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCY TRAINING HAS NOT EXPANDED IS THE LACK OF STIPENDS FOR RESIDENTS. BECAUSE . PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PROGRAMS ARE NOT HOSPITAL-BASED, FUNDING HAS TO \u00b7 BE OBTAINED FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES AND PIECED TOGETHER TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS. SUPPORT MAY COME FROM FOUNDATIONS, INDUSTRY, THE MILITARY, RESEARCH GRANTS, THE INSTITUTION HOUSING THE PROGRAM, AND ST A TE AND FEDERAL. SOURCES. PROGRAMS FREQUENTLY PAY THEIR RESIDENTS FROM SEVERAL SOURCES AND INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS OFTEN DERIVE THEIR INCOME FROM MORE tHAN ONE SOURCE. FOR EXAMPLE, A GENERAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINING PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA WHICH RECEIVED MORE THAN 50 APPLICATIONS AND WHICH COULD TRAIN 12 RESIDENTS IF IT HAD STIPENDS AVAILABLE, IS CURRENTLY TRAINING ONLY NINE RESIDENTS. FEDERAL GRANTS PAY FULL\u00b7\u00b7 STIPENDS FOR TWO RESIDENTS AND 50% OF STIPEND SUPPORT FOR TWO MORE RESIDENTS; INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS FULLY SUPPORT ONE RESIDENT AND PARTIALLY SUPPORT TWO OTHERS; THE NAVY PAYS ONE RESIDENT; A COUNTY CLINIC, ANOTHER; A PRIVATE MEDICAL GROUP, A THIRD, AND RESEARCH GRANTS PAY 7096 OF ONE RESIDENT'S INCOME AND 50% OF ANOTHER'S. IN SPITE OF THIS SORT OF CREATIVE, PATCHWORK FINANCING WHICH CHARACTERIZES PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY, APPROXIMATELY SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENTS ARE STILL PA YING THEIR OWN WAY. IN ONE OF OUR LARGEST TRAINING PROGRAMS, 12 OUT OF 29 RESIDENTS HA VE NO STIPEND SUPPORT. THE STIPENDS, IN MANY CASES, ARE LESS THAN THOSE OFFERED BY THE 336 OTHER CLINICAL SPECIALTIES. IT JS UNFORTUNATELY NOT UNHEARD OF FOR A PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENT TO RECEIVE A STIPEND IN THE $10,000 A YEAR RANGE. THE PROBLEM JS COMPOUNDED BECAUSE SOURCES FOR STIPENDS ARE OFTEN UNSTABLE FROM0YEAR TO YEAR, MAKING PLANNING DIFFICULT. WHEN ASKED TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF FUNDED SLOTS THEY WILL HAVE AVAILABLE THE FOLLOWING YEAR, RESIDENCY PROGRAM DIRECTORS OFTEN ESTIMATE FEWER THAN THE NUMBER OF CURRENTLY FUNDED SLOTS. THE DIRECTOR OF A GENERAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PROGRAM LOCATED IN THE NORTHEAST, WHICH IS TRAINING FIVE RESIDENTS, ECHOES THE CONCERNS OF MANY PROGRAM DIRECTORS WHEN HE SAYS HE ANTICIPATES THAT FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ONLY TWO SLOTS NEXT YEAR. THE PROBLEM IS FURTHER COMPOUNDED BECAUSE FREQUENTLY THERE IS ONLY LIMITED INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT FOR PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINING PROGRAMS. THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE STRONGLY RECOMMENDS INCREASED FEDERAL AND STATE SUPPORT FOR ALL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINING AND EMPHASIZES THAT THE FIRST PRIORITY IN FUNDING MUST BE RESIDENT STIPENDS. IN MANY INSTANCES IT IS IN THE INTEREST OF INDIVIDUAL STATES TO PROVIDE FOR THE EDUCATION OF THESE SPECIALISTS IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THEIR OWN POPULATIONS. THERE IS ALSO A NEED FOR INCREASED INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT TO BUILD UP THE EDUCATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND FOR INCREASED INVOLVEMENT OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR PARTICULARLY IN THE FIELD OF OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE. FUNDING FROM ALL SOURCES SHOULD BE CHANNELED TO UNIVERSITIES AND TO STATE GOVERNMENTS WHICH IN TURN WOULD DIRECTLY SUPPORT SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEAL TH AS WELL AS OTHER SITES WHERE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED, SUCH AS SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE AND OCCUPATIONAL SITES OUTSIDE OF SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEAL TH. 337 PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IS A SPECIAL TY NOT ONLY WITH A DISTINGUISHED HISTORY BUT ALSO WITH AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY NOW AND IN THE FUTURE --IN ESTABLISHING COST -EFFECTIVE HEAL TH CARE PROGRAMS, IN PROVIDING BASIC RESEARCH IN EPIDEMIOLOGY, IN HEAL TH PROMOTION, IN PROTECTING THE WORKER, IN PREVENTING DISABILITY, AND IN FACILITATING EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. THE SPECIAL TY IS PREPARING PHYSICIANS TO DEAL WITH THE INCREASINGLY COMPLEX POLITICAL AND SOCIAL HEALTH CARE ISSUES ON WHICH HINGES THE FUTURE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED ST A TES AND THE WORLD. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU THIS MORNING. I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOLLOWING THE TESTIMONY OF MY COLLEAGUE, DR. MIKE PARKINSON. 338 GOOD MORNING. I AM MIKE PARKINSON, A SECOND-YEAR PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENT AT JOHNS HOPKINS AND PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENTS. APMR IS SUPPORTED JOINTLY BY THE ASSOCIATION OF TEACHERS OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. THE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENTS BEFORE OTHER EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL BODIES, FOSTERS COMMUNICATION AMONG RESIDENTS AND WITH MEDICAL STUDENTS, AND GENERALLY PROMOTES THE IDEALS INHERENT IN THE FIELD OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. BOTH THE 1980 GMENAC STUDY AND THE 1986 HHS REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS ON THE STATUS OF HEALTH PERSONNEL IN THE U.S. PROJECTED A SEVERE SHORTAGE OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PHYSICIANS. THE HHS REPORT STATES THAT \"THE SHORTAGE OF PHYSICIANS OPTING FOR ADVANCED PUBLIC HEAL TH TRAINING IS A MAJOR ISSUE. THEIR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL BACKGROUNDS WHEN COUPLED WITH GRADUATE PREPARATION IN THE PUBLIC HEAL TH SCIENCES UNIQUELY QUALIFIES THEM FOR LEADERSHIP IN PRACTICE, RESEARCH AND FACULTY ROLES IDENTIFIED AS BEING IN SHORT SUPPLY.\" (I) TODAY, I WILL DISCUSS HOW PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCIES SPECIFICALLY AND EFFICIENTLY PREPARE PHYSICIANS TO ASSUME THESE CHALLENGING AND CONSTANTLY EXPANDING ROLES. I WILL DISCUSS SOME OF THE POPULATIONS WHICH THESE PROGRAMS SERVE AND REVIEW SOME OF THE DIVERSE ACTIVITIES WHICH PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINED PHYSICIANS ARE ENGAGED IN. I WILL PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF THE TYPES OF POSITIONS THESE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS ASSUME ON THE COMPLETION OF THEIR RESIDENCIES. I WILL OUTLINE THE MAJOR BARRIERS FACING THE MEDICAL STUDENT WHO 339 SEEKS TO PURSUE SUCH TRAINING. AND FINALLY I WILL ARGUE THAT PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCIES, WITH THEIR UNIQUE COMBINATION OF INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE AND SKILLS, REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT, FRONT-LINE RESOURCE IN THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE OUR NATION'S HEALTH. FAMILY PRACTICE AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS WERE DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF MANY DIFFERENT FORCES BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. THE HAPHAZARD TRAINING OF THE \"GP\" AND THE \"E.R. DOC\" WERE CLEARLY INADEQUATE TO MEET INCREASINGLY SOPHISTICATED PUBLIC DEMAND AND DID NOT REFLECT THE BURGEONING BODY OF MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE. SIMILARLY, THE \"LAISSEZ-FAIRE\" PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTOR OR \"COMPANY DOC\" ARE UNFORTUNATE STEREOTYPES OF A BYGONE ERA. THEY ARE BEING REPLACED BY PREVENTIVE MEDICINE SPECIALISTS WHO ARE PREPARED TO DEAL WITH GROWING PUBLIC CONCERN WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL RISKS AND EXPANDING LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY MANDATES IN THIS ERA OF DIMINSHING FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR HEALTH CARE. THE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT DISCIPLINES OF EPIDEMIOLOGY, RISK ASSESSMENT AND CLINICAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE DEMAND A SYSTEMATIC, INTEGRATED AND PRACTICAL APPROACH TO PHYSICIAN TRAINING. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCIES PROVIDE THAT APPROACH. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCIES TRAIN PHYSICIANS IN THOSE SITES AND SETTINGS WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY TO SERVE THE TRULY NEEDY OR MOST AT-RISK. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINED PHYSICIANS DELIVER PRIMARY CARE IN MANY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO THE MEDICALLY INDIGENT, NAMELY, 340 THE UNDER- AND UN-INSURED. A RESIDENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA PROGRAM NOW DIRECTS A SIX-COUNTY RURAL GEORGIA HEAL TH DEPARTMENT AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL CLINICAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIVITIES FROM PRENATAL AND PRIMARY CARE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND THE AIDS SCREENING PROGRAM. RESIDENTS ARE TRAINED TO CONDUCT DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMS AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, SUCH AS MIGRANT WORKERS AND PRISONERS. A RECENT GRADUATE FROM THE HOPKINS PROGRAM NOW OVERSEES ALL MEDICAL SER VICES AND MONITORS AIDS, TB AND FOODBORNE ILLNESS FOR THE MARYLAND STATE PENITENTIARY SYSTEM. \u00b7RESIDENTS LEARN TO MEASURE COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH STATUTES AND EXAMINE WORKERS FOR EVIDENCE OF ADVERSE TOXIC EXPOSURES. ANOTHER HOPKINS GRADUATE NOW WORKS WITH NIOSH IN CINCINNATI INVESTIGATING REPORTED CLUSTERS OF DISEASE AMONG WORKERS IN CERTAIN PLANTS OR INDUSTRIES. PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENTS ARE ALSO TRAINED TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND INCREASINGLY TO TEACH TECHNIQUES OF INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR MODIFICATION TO MINIMIZE RISK FACTORS. A RECENT GRADUATE OF STONY BROOK'S PROGRAM IS NOW RESPONSIBLE FOR HEAL TH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES AT A PROVIDENCE, R.I., COMMUNITY HEAL TH CENTER. SHE ALSO TEACHES PREVENTIVE PRACTICES TO BROWN UNIVERSITY MEDICAL STUDENTS. FULLY 20% OF ALL RECENT OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE RESIDENTS HAVE ACCEPTED ACADEMIC POSITIONS, A TESTIMONY TO THE DEMAND FOR THIS EXPERTISE IN OUR NATION'S MEDICAL SCHOOLS. (2) PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINED PHYSICIANS INCREASINGLY PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AT THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF OUR GOVERNMENT IN ARTICULATING 341 AND IMPLEMENTING INFORMED, SCIENTIFICALLY SOUND POLICIES. A RECENT GRADUATE OF CDC'S PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAM NOW DIRECTS THE NATIONAL OFFICE ON SMOKING AND HEALTH. MANY PHYSICIANS UNDERTAKE FORMAL PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINING AFTER DECIDING THAT ALL TOO OFTEN \"CURATIVE\" MEDICINE DOESN'T CURE, AND THAT \"HIGH TECHNOLOGY FIXES\" THAT LEAD OUR NATION TO SPEND DISPROPORTIONATE RESOURCES ON THE FINAL TWO WEEKS OF LIFE IN AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT ARE INHERENTLY WRONG. MANY HAVE COME TO REALIZE THAT PREVENTIVE PRACTICES, HEALTH EDUCATION, CONTAINMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AND SOCIOCULTURAL INFLUENCES ARE OFTEN PRIMARY DETERMINANTS OF WELLNESS AND DISEASE. THESE PHYSICIANS ARE DRAWN TO THE REAL WORLD MIX OF INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERIENCES WHICH PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINING AND PRACTICE UNIQUELY PROVIDES. ONE WOULD THINK THAT MEDICAL STUDENTS INTERESTED IN COMBINING THEIR CLINICAL EX PER TISE WITH POP ULA TI ON-BASED QUANTITATIVE SKILLS WOULD HAVE LITTLE OR NO PROBLEM DOING SO. IN FACT, THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE. I HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS LETTERS FROM STUDENTS WHO FIND IT DIFFICULT TO UNDERTAKE A PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCY. FIRST, THERE IS A DEFINITE SHORTAGE OF ROLE MODELS, OR AT LEAST ROLE MODELS WHO ARE ROUTINELY ACCESSIBLE IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOL SETTING. THE HISTORICAL RIFT BETWEEN CURATIVE MEDICINE AND PREVENTIVE OR PUBLIC HEALTH MEDICINE HAS CREATED A SITUATION WHERE THE SPECIAL TY OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE IS, IN MY EXPERIENCE, RARELY DISCUSSED AS A CAREER OPTION WITH STUDENTS. MANY RESIDENCIES ARE AFFILIATED WITH LOCAL OR STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OR SCHOOLS OF 342 PUBLIC HEALTH. AS A RESULT, MEDICAL STUDENTS OFTEN HAVE LITTLE OR NO CONTACT WITH PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENTS. THIS LACK OF ROLE MODEL EXPOSURE IN OUR MEDICAL SCHOOLS IS A MAJOR IMPEDIMENT TO STUDENTS LEARNING ABOUT AND PURSUING THE FIELD. THE MOST FORMIDABLE OBSTACLE, HOWEVER, IS THE FACT THAT THE MEDICAL STUDENT WHO WISHES TO UNDERTAKE A PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCY FACES CONSIDERABLE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY AND EVEN HARDSHIP. IN 1987, THE AVERAGE GRADUATING MEDICAL STUDENT WAS $30,000 IN DEBT. (3) PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCIES ARE FUNDED FROM FREQUENTLY UNRELIABLE SOURCES, OFTEN AT LEVELS FAR BELOW THOSE OF COMPARABLE RESIDENCIES (IRONICALLY, IN FIELDS ALREADY FOUND TO HAVE AN EXCESS OF PHYSICIANS). MEDIAN SALARIES FOR PREVENTIVE MEDICINE PHYSICIANS ARE IN THE $48,000 RANGE (4); SURELY IT ISN'T THE PROMISE OF AN EXTRAVAGANT INCOME WHICH LURES THE STUDENT INTO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINING. THE STUDENT ORA WN TO THE INTELLECTUAL EXCITEMENT OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE OFTEN, UNFORTUNATELY, CONCLUDES THAT HE OR SHE CANNOT AFFORD THE ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY OF TRAINING. AS A RESULT OF THESE TWO MAJOR BARRIERS --LACK OF ROLE MODELS AND LACK OF ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR PREVENTIVE MEDICINE TRAINING -\u00ad EVEN THE MOST MOTIVATED STUDENT RARELY SEES THE PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCY AS A VIABLE OPTION. YET, FOR OUR FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS OR OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE PRACTITIONERS, THESE PROGRAMS REPRESENT THE MOST EFFICIENT, TARGETED AND INTELLECTUALLY SOUND TRAINING ROUTE. HISTORICALLY, THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE NEED FOR TYPES OF MEDICAL SPECIALISTS, RESIDENCY TRAINING PROGRAMS, .J43 AND MEDICAL SCHOOL COUNSELLING REGARDING CAREER CHOICES. CLEARLY, PREVENTIVE MEDICINE SUFFERS ON ALL COUNTS. A WELL-DEFINED AND GROWING NEED FOR THESE UNIQUELY QUALIFIED HEAL TH PROFESSIONALS HAS NOT BEEN TRANSLATED INTO ADEQUATE (NO LESS EXPANDED) RESIDENCY SUPPORT. MEDICAL STUDENTS, DUE TO INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES AND LACK OF EXPOSURE TO ROLE MODELS, ARE NOT ENCOURAGED TO UNDERTAKE AND DO NOT PURSUE SUCH TRAINING, AND, AS A RESULT, NATIONAL HEALTH NEEDS THREATEN TO GO UNMET. AS SCARCER RESOURCES DEMAND THE BEST HEAL TH RETURN FOR OUR NATION'S INVESTMENT, PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCY-TRAINED PHYSICIANS WILL BE CALLED UPON TO APPLY THE CONCEPTS OF ATTRIBUTABLE RISK AND RISK ASSESSMENT TO THE DIFFICULT CHOICES WE WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FACE. DECIDING WHERE TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES: WHETHER TO REDUCE THE AIDS EDUCATION PROGRAM OR EXPAND PRENATAL SCREENING, WHETHER TO CUT BACK ON RADON AND ASBESTOS MONITORING OR INCREASE MOBILE MAMMOGRAPHY UNITS --THESE ARE THE PROBLEMATIC DECISIONS WHICH THESE PHYSICIANS WILL TACKLE, COMBINING THEIR SKILLS AS PRACTITIONERS, EPIDEMIOLOGISTS AND PLANNERS. WHETHER WORKING IN GOVERNMENT, PRIVATE INDUSTRY OR ACADEMIA, PREVENTIVE MEDICINE SPECIALISTS HAVE AS THEIR PRIMARY FOCUS THE PRESERVATION AND PROMOTION OF OUR NATION'S HEALTH. IF THE OLD ADAGE \"PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CUR.E\" IS EVER TO BECOME MORE THAN ATTRACTIVE RHETORIC, PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESIDENCES MUST BE MADE A VIABLE OPTION FOR THOSE HIGHLY MOTIVATED PHYSICIANS WHOSE HEARTS AND MINDS ARE DECIDEDLY IN THE RIGHT PLACE. 344 References: 1.

GAE American College of Cardiology HEART HOUSE 9111 OLD GEORGETOWN ROAD BETHESDA, MARYLAND 20814 1301 I 897-5400 Statement of the American College of Cardiology Before The Council on Graduate Medical Education November 20, 1987 The American College of Cardiology (ACC) is actively concerned with issues related to medical manpower and welcomes this opportunity to share with the Council on Graduate Medical Education our experiences and activities that may be of assistance. The mission of the American College of Cardiology is to foster optimal cardiovascular care and disease prevention through professional education, promotion of research, and leadership in the development of standards and formulation of health care policy. We believe that access to care, quality of care, and graduate medical education are inextricably linked and all essential to the continued excellence of this nation's health care system. While health manpower is an unusually complex subject that will benefit from multiple perspectives, we believe our efforts as a professional society, representing 16,000 members who are expert in the provision of cardiovascular medical care, can contribute to the Council's deliberations. The ACC is pleased to announce the forthcoming availability of a new report on manpower in cardiology. As in the past, the College has initiated a lengthy planning process, including the appointment of a Steering Committee and six task forces to prepare for a major meeting, entitled a Bethesda Conference, which was held October 15 and 16, 1987. The objectives of this Conference were to 1) assess the roles of cardiovascular specialists, 2) give guidance to the community regarding quality of care, 3) develop a posture to react effectively to changing needs, and 4) develop an information base for long-range actions. Although the report of Bethesda Conference #19: \"Trends in Cardiology; Implications for Manpower\" has yet to undergo the formal approval process, once the report is available, we will be pleased to provide copies to the Council for use in assessing our nation's physician manpower needs. 347 SUMMARY OF AMERICAN COLLEGE OF GASTROENTEROLOGY TESTIMONY BEFORE THE COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION * The American College of Gastroenterology wholeheartedly agrees that the primary concern of all participants in the health care system should be the assurance of quality health care. * In response to GMENAC, the federal government has made enormous cuts in its support for graduate medical education. Further cuts would seriously threaten the nation's medical education system. * Federal policymakers are currently examining options for reforming the Medicare physician payment system to make it more competitive and cost sensitive. This will increase the degree to which the medical system is responsive to the marketplace laws of supply and demand in shaping the size and specialty mix of the nation's physician population. * Attempts to predict the need for physicians, whether in the aggregate or in terms of specialty training, are very difficult since it is impossible to forecast all relevant factors. If a new 349 system which is truly market responsive, can be designed, there will be little need for artificial manipulation of the system. * GME should be supported through patient revenues and should be provided in all appropriate settings, including non-inpatient settings. 350 _AL l.IANCE OF FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES (FM Gs) Co-Chairmen Narin Shah, M.D. lkn.mullab Khan, M.D. AMERICAN COLLEGE OF INTER.NATIONAL PHYSICIANS Robert Brun, M.D. 169 Third Anit Drive Lot Angt\"let, CA 90049 (115) 479.9555 Antonio Dones.

D.C. !0001 (!O!) 757-1920 TESTIMONY TO COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION SUBCOMMITTEE ON FOREIGN MEDICAL GRADUATES October 5, 1987 I, Dr. Navin Shah, am here to testify on behalf of the Alliance of Foreign Medical Graduates, as their Co-chainnan. There are 1,200 medical schools (including 127 United States medical schools) all over the world. ECFM3 has issued passing certificates to 130,000 FM3's belonging to 900 medical schools from BO different nations. Due to unavailability of a central body to judge the standards of all schools in the light of U.S. require\u00ad ments, ECFM3 examination created a way to select FM3's to serve American people. This examination also included English language testing. As America needed to supplement their medical manpower, FM:;'s from all over the world came to U.S.A. after successfully canpleting the ECFM3 examination. They competed for residency slots and some of the lucky ones who got it, were given American post graduate training. After completing the training success\u00ad fully, they appeared and passed license examination. Most of the FM3's were graduates of well established medical schools while some were from specially created medical schools which catered for American market. Presently 120,000 FM:;'s (21.8\"/o of the total number of physicians in U.S.A.) are in practice of medicine. They have taken U.S. post graduate training and achieved license to practice. over a period of 25 years FM3's have served their co-citizens and they have an excellent verifiable record. Six FMJ's earned Nobel prize in Medicine for u;s.A., 2C% of the medical teachers are FM3's in U.S.A., 6000 FM:;'s are in field of research and 80'/o of FM3's are in direct patient care. FM3's have and are serving areas which attracted few American medical graduates -the inner city hospitals, psychiatric institutions, small county hospitals, VA Hospitals -and helped less fortunate citizens. Some studies have shown: 1) FM3 and USMJ as professional, are equal, 2) compared to their numbers, less percentage of FM3's are involved in malpractice and have paid less number of dollars in malpractice verdicts, 3) less number of FMG's are disciplined by state bodies. So, in short, FM:;'s have served and served well. In last 5 years due to various known and unknown factors there are distinct attempts by some to discredit Fl'C's as second rate medical practitioners. Presently 16% of U.S. residencies are manned by both USFM3's and Alien Fl'C's. Of 4452 recognized teaching programs 185 have 100'/o of their residents from foreicp medical schools, while 1115 have between 21 and gcr:., llOCl \\12\\T 351 have less than 20%. New York City hospitals have 40% and state of New Jersey has 60% FM3's manning their residency. Approximately 30 to 40% of residency slots in Neonatology, Nuclear Medicine, Pathology, Nephrology, Public Health are filled by FM3's. American medical system needs FM3's. They go through entrance examination, post graduate training and license examinatoin, which is totally controlled by American institution. If some feel that FM::'s are not adequately trained then it is the fault of American system and not of FM3, who is doing all what is told to do. Discrimination to FM3's in training and to FM3's in practice is a reality. For this reason Alliance of FM3's (group of large number of practicing FM3's) have just introduced two Bills in Congress to do away with discrimination and achieve duely earned equality. We feel that it is very difficult and almost impractical to attempt to accredit medical schools all over the world. The most pragmatic way would be to accredit each and every FM3 who is entering American medical system. This will do away with present 2 tier system and will treat FM3's fairly. We propose: 1) All FM3's take National boards as taken by American medical students -i.e., one test for all medical graduates. 2) All FM3's must pass English examination. 3) After achieving #1 and 2, FM3 competes and enter into post graduate training -year one. During this year FM3 will be judged on all aspects of medicine and English language. Once the FM3 has been qualified he/she enters further years of training. 4) American Residency system to ensure that all teaching programs are of similar quality. 5) Those FM3's who are unsuccessful in the first year will be removed of the system and a central body keeps the data so that FM3 is not part of any training program in future. 6) Once FM3 completes training he gets license in the same fashion as an USM:;. 7) Once FM3 gets license he/she should be treated exactly as an USM:; is treated in practice of medicine, hospital privileggs and reciprocity. \u00b7 By this mechanism, all doctors in U.S. training and in practice ate treated equal. If there is a need for reduction in number of training slots, it should be done across the board and not selective\u00ad ly eliminating FMG's. Presently there is a scarcity of medical doctors in rural areas, in addition with increasing aging population, advent of deadly disease AIDS, increasing drug abuse and other iatrogenic maladies, America will need more doctors. In 1986, out of 20500 residency 1600 were filled by USMS and 2200 by both USFM::; and Alien FM:;s 352 and almost 2300 slots were unfilled. In 1985, 6000 qualified F'l'{;'s could not enter training programs and it is estimated that almost 10000 qualified Ft-U's are waiting, since 1 to 5 years, to get into training programs. We believe it is sheer waste of medi\u00ad cal talent. One of the many suggestions is to of fer them training in needed specialty with a contractual obligation to serve Jn particular needed geographical area for a period of 3 to 5 years. This way both the purposes will be served fruitfully. We strongly believe that it will be unwise, costly and possibly harmful to replace Ft-U's by PA's. A 2 year trained medical person is a poor replacement for totally trained doctor in the medical service. This way superb American medical system will not reach all the patients and especially not to the less fortunates. PA's B hour shift, constant medical supervision and negligible help in ICU/CCU will not only prove costly but perhaps dangerous to patient's health. In these days of spiraling malpractice premiums, replacing doctors with PA may worsen the already bad situations. I,>s a doctor and American citizen feel that,American citizens deserve the best possible for their medical care. Finally, a word about U.S.A.'s obligation to developing and under\u00ad developed nations. We feel 1000 training slots be created to train F'l'{;'s in all different medical specialities and these slots to be located in U.S. geographical areas where there is need for doctors. This is to be funded by foreign aid. It will consume less than 1% of present foreign aid packet. These trained FMJ's will go back to their country. They will not be allowed to appear for license examination and hence can not practice in U.S.A. Faulter\u00ad ing Ft-U's will be deported. Lastly, a request to this body to contact me in matters of FMJ's for Alliance involvement and input. Thank you for your patient hearing . ' c . (' lL_c~ (~ ~ ~ Navin Shah, M.D. Co-Chairman Alliance Foreign Medical Graduates NS/cag 353 TO: FROM: cJuncil on Graduate Medical Education American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation \"Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation: Manpower Needs\" The goal of the specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation (physiatrist) is to optimally restore physical function, relieve pain, and mimimize te psychological, social and vocational sequelae of disability. Physiatri~ts use the routine history and physical examination, x-rays, laborat0ry studies and other diagnostic techniques like other physicians, but also frequently prescribes such treatment modalities as heat, cold, electrical stimulations and biofeedback. Special types of therapeutic exercise are often prescribeJ. Physiatrists are expert in the prescription of prosthetic and orthotic devices, as well as electrical and mechanical assistive devices. Physiatrists perform several different roles in several settings in todays health care system. Concerning inpatient rehab services, the PM&R specialist is the attending physician for patients who are admitted to rehabilitation hospitals or units. The PM&R specialist is frequently the manager of care and the primary care physician for severely disabled patients. In addition, consultations are a major part of the practice both on an inpatient and outpatient basis. A recent survey of Academy members showed that the most prevelant services rendered were inpatient rehabilitation management, electrodiagnosis, consultations and prosthetics and orthotics prescriptions and training. The patients seen range across all ages but there is a heavy geriatric component. Our manpower survey specifically indicated that about 39% of patients seen were over 65, 33% between 40 and 65, 21% 21 to 39, 9% 14 -20 and 10% under 14. In addition, the manpower survey indicates that stroke, arthritis are two of the four most prevalent types of conditions seen and those conditions are common to the aged . General demographic data reflect an increase in elderly with the U.S. from 12% now to about 22% by the turn of the century. The most frequently seen conditions seen are pain, stroke, general neurologic conditions, arthritis, spinal injury, amputation. The GMENAC estimated a need for 4,060 physiatrists by 1990. We believe the estimate was low because of a failure to recognize the increasing prevalence of conditions treated by physiatrists and the increasing use of their services. Since the report of GMENAC Medicare PPS and similar hospital cost containment measures have stimulated the utilization of rehabilitation services and other post acute care services. In addition, the numbers of aged and disabled are increasing. The supply of physiatrists is still far short of even the GMENAC estimates. we estimate a supply of only about 2,500 board certified physiatrists in 1990. We will graduate about 600 -800 residents between now and 1990 and our estimated annual attrition rate is about 40. ftecommRndation~: Provide financial incentives for the training oE physical medicine ~nd r;habilitation residents through Medicare and expansion of grant support for residency training.

A Comment on Certain Issues of Interest to the Council on Graduate Medical Fducation submitted on behalf of the American Association of Neurological SUrgeons and the Congress of Neurological SUrgeons November 19, 1987 Baltimore, Maryland 35 7 Neurosurgery has been debating issues of manpc::Mer since its birth as a modern specialty, with its American founder, Harvey CUshing, stating in the early 1900's that a ratio of one neurosurgeon/l,000,000 population was suitable for this country. D..lring CUshings time the neurosurgeon primarily treated patients with brain turners and epilepsy. since his time the scope of neurosurgery has expanded greatly as has the number of neurosurgeons. It is cu=ently estimated the United States ratio is one neurosurgeon/70,000 population compared with 1/500,000 in Britain and 1/140,000 in canada. These comparisons have led some non-neurosurgeon physicians and laymen to proclaim there are too many United States neurosurgeons. These proclamations rarely consider the differences between the United states and other countries with regard to geography, stn.Icture of the health care delivery system, and the peculiar demands of the population. Manpower Studies In order to study some of these differences neurosurgery has participated in a number of state, regional, and national studies of manpower in the past two decades. The first major detailed study was undertaken by the American Association of Neurological Surgeons {AANS) through a contractual arrangement with the National Institutes of Neurological Disease and Stroke in 1973. The resulting AANS Neurosurgical Manpower Study was published in 1975. This report dealt with practicing neurosurgeons, program directors, neurosurgeons in training, and manpbwer and workload in neurosurgery. Perfonned primarily by questionnaire the study was i.rrqx>rtant in that it, for the first time, defined the scope of neurosurgery as cu=ently practiced, the contents of neurosurgical training, something of the problems faced by program directors, and estimated the total neurosurgical population by 1985 to be approximately 3,950. Neurosurgery participated in the study on Surgical Services for the United States (SOSSUS) jointly sponsored by the American College of Surgeons and the American Surgical Association. Finding a reduced number of skilled neurosurgical procedures being done per neurosurgeon 358 it advised careful consideration of the potential benefits to be gained by regionalization of care. The next major study of neurosurgery was that of Mendenhall and co-workers who, with support from the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation, exhaustively studied the major medical and surgical specialties in the country. Mendenhall used as his primary tool a week long professional diary which in the case of neurosurgery was completed by 426 neurosurgeons (a 63% response rate) chosen at random from the AMA master data files. 'Ihls study established nationally and by US census regions several important facts about the practice of neurosurgery in the United States with It10re accuracy than had previously been obtained. For exanple, the mean number of professional hours per week of a neurosurgeon varied from 63.3 in the New England area to 50.6 in the It10Untain area of the western region. 'Ihe weekly daily patient encounters varied from 161. o in the east south central area of the southern region to 69. 8 in the pacific area of the western region. Similar marked regional differences were noted throughout the report. 'Ihe study, completed in 1981, suggested any policy which governs future manpower numbers in neurosurgery must be based upon close scrutiny of these regional differences. their extent and explanations. Future neurosurgical needs were studied by the Graduate Medical F.ducation National Advisory Committee of the Department of Health and Human Services using a needs based ltlOdel. 'Ihis study is important because for the first time an atterrQ:it was made to calculate the number of neurosurgeons needed on the base of an estimate of incidence and prevalence of disease treated by a neurosurgeon. It established a basic need of 2, 793 neurosurgeons by 1990 with a range of 2500 to 2800 and predicted an excess of close to 1,000 neurosurgeons. 'Ihe study has been criticized extensively for several reasons, however. 'Ihe Delphi Panel that was put together to review neurosurgery, and other specialties was formed hastily and was given little time to review incidence and prevalence data. In addition, the final numbers calculated were developed by an \"objective\" panel whose primary function was to adjudicate differences between specialties where scope of practice overlapped. No final data is available on the accuracy of 359 the process. Continuing this commitment to investigate and learn, the leadership of the American Association of Neurological Burgeons and the Congress of Neurological Burgeons is currently putting together an extensive manpower survey of the specialty. available at the time of this report. Supply The results are not Based upon an extensive review of available data some of which admittedly is several years old, it is estimated there are 3,500 individual physicians in the United States whose practice is limited, largely, if not entirely, to surgical treatment of diseases of the nervous system. Since no suitable definition of a proper density of neurosurgeons has ever been developed it is inipossible to say whether these data indicate enough neurosurgeons. One can, however, make some statements regarding the illlpact current production of neurosurgeons has had upon the distribution of neurosurgeons, and draw some conclusions on the availability of neurosurgical care. Since 1960 the percentage of communities 50,000 to 200,000 in population with Board certified neurosurgeons has increased from 40% to better than 75%. For towns of 30,000 to 50,000 that percentage has risen from 8% to 27%. In 1982 it was determined based upon current systems of emergency medical service and communication that less than 2% of the U.S. population did not have access for timely emergency neurosurgical services exemplified by the patient with a head injury and an acute epidural hematoma. Future Needs It is illq:Jossible at this time to make accurate forecasts about future needs of neurosurgeons, sinply because it is illq:Jossible to make predictions about future needs for neurosurgical care. At the time of the studies mentioned above, from the initial AANS study to that of GMENAC, there were no predictions regarding the value of such technology as magnetic resonance imaging, brain tissue transplant procedures, and the use of neurosurgical skills to affect the manipulation of brain genetic abnormalities. The effects of present governmental policy related to cost containment and the 360 education of foreign medical graduates were not apparent. In retrospect there were not formulae available which would permit one to a=urately access the :inpact of these variables on prediction. It is argued by some that two major factors which will influence the future need for neurosurgeons, are public demand for services and gOll'ernrnent policies. If there is one consistently accepted position in the debate O\\l'er neurosurgical manpower, it is that a federal policy of two decades ago was ill conceived in doubling the number of medical school graduates. If one accepts the assurrg;ition that with some variation in distribution the number of neurosurgeons today is such that there is adequate access to care then one does not have to be concerned with future numbers. One must concentrate, instead, upon net demand, a balance between services requested, and those for which the public are willing to pay. This is primarily an economic issue, which can be stu,died by looking at the practice of the public in requesting neurosurgical. The AANS Manpower Study, which is currently being developed will, among other analyses, look at the economic nature of the practice of most neurosurgeons in this country, including the developing practice, the established practice, and the practice in the throes of tennination. Financing Postgraduate medical education programs in neurosurgery are primarily university based and are largely financed through hospital\u00ad patient income. Besides the delivery of patient care, other major activities of the resident physician include basic and clinical research, and teaching. Financing of these activities is through private and public sources. It would be unrealistic to accept the prOll'iso that the public does not have an interest in the financing of graduate medical education. On the negative side public support of residency training programs do increase the short-tenn direct costs of medical care. On the positive side, invesbnent by the public in resident graduate medical education can be equated with essential research and development programs so necessary to insure a future supply of quality medical care. Young 36) professionals of all walks of life, whether lawyer, young executive, or military officer are paid for service rendered while preparing for greater responsibilities. We nmst accept this with the young physician. The major question is, who should provide the funds? The funding nmst be through third party payers, hospitals, and governments. Conclusions 1. The proper density and distribution of neurosurgeons in this country will not be determined by g, study, but by an ongoing analysis balancing realistic appraisals of technological advances with public demand. 2. The debate on financing graduate medical education should focus more on the value to beneficiaries of resident services, and less on some arbitrarily defined scheme of price support. 3. Federal policy should support conclusions l and 2.

In particular, the College would like to highlight the effect of the increased cost of liability insurance on obstetric manpower. ACOG is an organization comprised of more than 26,000 physicians specializing in women's health care, including over 90 percent of all board-certified obstetrician-gynecologists. The purpose of the College is to establish and maintain the highest possible standards of education, practice, and research in obstetrics and gynecology. We strongly agree with the Council's Subcommittee on Physician Manpower which concluded in its draft report that it is impossible to quantify the aggregate supply of and (especially) the demand for physicians. The Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Committee (GMENAC) predicted that in 1990 there would be a total of 38,500 physicians listing themselves as obstetrician-gynecologists. The actual figure will he about 36,000. GMEN AC calculated there would be 6,200 obstetric and gynecologic residents in 1990; there are now 4,600 and numbers are declining by 1-2 percent per year. GMENAC projected that 37 percent of all deliveries would be done by family physicians in 1990; the numbers are now about 15 percent and declining. GMENAC projected a surplus of 10,500 obstetrician-gynecologists by 1990; we are now in the midst of a distinct shortage in many areas. As noted by the Subcommittee, many variables affect supply and demand projections. Of particular concern to us is the fact that liability pressures are resulting in large numbers of physicians quitting the practice of obstetrics. As of 1985, 12.3 percent of obstetricians nationally had given up obstetrics due to liability pressures. These physicians stopped their obstetric practices at younger ages than would otherwise be expected: 22.5 percent between ages 35 and 44, 28.9 percent between ages 45 and 54, and 30.7 percent between 364 ages 55 and 64. Data for 1987, now being gathered, are expected to show an even larger percentage of obstetrician-gynecologists giving up obstetrics. Large numbers of family physicians are also being forced to discontinue obstetrics as a result of the high cost of liability insurance to cover an obstetric practice. One-third of California's family physicians, almost 40 percent of Texas family physicians, and approximat<:ly one-half of Nevada's rural family physicians have stopped practicing obstetrics. Three hundred of 441 family physicians or 68 percent of those responding to a recent Alabama survey have stopped delivering babies, These trends exacerbate the problem of access to maternity care, particularly in rural ~nd underserved areas. For example, 67 Georgia counties and 28 Alabama counties are without a provider of obstetric care. If the trends continue unabated, obstetric care will become scarce even in the face of a projected surplus of physicians. Other variables will affect demand for the services of obstetrician-gynecologists to an extent not yet known. Heterosexual and perinatal transmission of AIDS are rapidly growing and are a most serious problem. Demand for infertility care has almost doubled since 1980, both because of increased fertility problems due to sexually transmitted disease and delayed childbearing, and because of new technology to relieve infertility. No one can predict today the effect that developments such as immunization against papillomavirus, socio-cultural changes which lead to increased or decreased family size, new family planning technologies, or hormonal analogs to eliminate endometriosis will have on the demand for obstetric and gynecologic services. Given our inability to fully anticipate these events or their impact on the supply of or demand for obstetrician-gynecologists, policies which would have a dramatic effect 365 on physician supply must be approached with extreme caution, We concur with the Subcommittee on Physician Manpower that \"there is no convincing evidence to suggest that the projected oversupply of physicians will necessarily lead to socially undesirable consequences. 11 We recommend that the Subcommittee on Physician Manpower include obstetrics and gynecology in the context of its discussion of primary care. Obstetrics and gynecology has been recognized as a primary care specialty in formal statements by the American Medical Association (AMA), Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), Council of Medical Specialty Societies (CMSS), and American College of Surgeons (ACS), This designation is borne out by data from the USC-Mendenhall study, for example, which reported that 7 8 percent of all encounters between obstetrician-gynecologists and patients could be defined as primary care, and National Center for Health Statistics data reporting that 62 percent of all ambulatory visits to obstetrician-gynecologists were for \"non-illness\" care. Assuming there is no significant change in the liability risk experienced by obstetrician-gynecologists, and considering that population cohorts show an increase in the female population aged 35 and older, the character of obstetrician-gynecologists' practice may change to emphasize even further well woman/primary care, With respect to the Commission's goal of increased representation of minorities in the health professions, the College would like to note that obstetrics/gynecology is a popular specialty with black physicians, second only to internal medicine. According to AMA data, consistently over 12 percent of all black residents are in obstetric and gynecologic programs, compared to 6.4 percent of residents overall. Women have also entered the specialty in large numbers. Fifty percent of all obstetric and gynecologic residents are now women; nearly 20 percent of all obstetrician-gynecologists are women, with the numbers on the increase, 366 ACOG strongly supports the conclusion in the draft report of the Subcommittee on Graduate Medical Education (GME) Programs and Financing that, \"Changes to the way GME is financed should be undertaken in an evolutionary manner, rather than precipitously. To do otherwise would run substantial risk of unanticipated adverse results.\" Over the long run, the reimbursement principles of the College favor alternative support mechanisms rather than reliance on direct patient care dollars for the educational development and research components of G ME. The College is also on record in support of a loan repayment program with a period of obligated service, as recommended by the Subcommittee on Physician Manpower, We believe the loan repayment option could serve as a valuable recruiting tool for medically underserved communities. In conclusion, the College appreciates the fact that the Commission is grappling with very difficult issues. However, it is appropriate to recall \u00b7the words of a small town Minnesota philosopher, Garrison Keillor who, at the very least, the Chairman, Dr. Neal Vanselow will recall said, \"Some luck lies in not getting what you thought you wanted, but in getting what you have, which once you have it you may be smart enough to see is what you would have wanted, had you known.\" 367 AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY ASC 0 .f35 North Michigan Avenue Suite 1717 Chi('ago, 60611 3U/644--0828 Executive Dire('tor Alfred Van Horn Ill Pnsldrnt B.).

As with all subspecialties of Internal Medicine, the process is underway for accreditation of Medical Oncology training programs by the Residency Review Committee, which will assure the quality of training in Oncology. We can be >proud of the accomplishments of medical oncolo\u00ad gists in improv.ing the quality of community cancer care, and the progress made in cancer research and education. Medical Oncology is unique among the Inter\u00ad nal Medicine specialties. The practicing oncolo\u00ad gists do less general internal medicine than most subspecialists because the complexities intrinsic to skill maintenance require a full-time commit\u00ad ment to oncology. In a little over a decade, there has been an explosion in the number of medical oncologists that has had a significant impact on cancer education, cancer research, and the care of patient:;; with cancer. Concern has been expressed regarding the potential overproduction of trained oncologists, a problem similar to that of the medical profession as a whole. In a national study of internal medicine manpower. it was concluded that \"the directors of the teaching hospitals and the subspeciahy fellowship pro\u00ad grams show no inclination to reduce the number of subspecialists in training.\"' To address the problem of total manpower. a survey of Medical Oncology training programs was made. The review covered 151 operational training programs in Medical Oncology. In these programs there are currently 767 trainees who will have completed at least two years of training by 1987. The current trainees will be eligible for the certifying examinations to be given in 1985 and 1987; there will be approximately 315 new trainees beginning in July 1985 who will be eligible for the 1987 examination. For the Novcmbor 1985 examination. approximately 750 applications have been received, similar to prior years. Semmsrs in Oncology, Vol 12, No 4 !December), 1985: p xxv-xx111 After the 1983 certifying examination, there are 2,975 oncologists certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine. This is close to the production estimates previously made, and by 1987 the number of oncologists should meet the calculated requirements. It would appear that by 1990 there will not be a deficiency of oncologists. The exact number of additional noncertified oncologists practicing medical oncology is unknown. Training in Medical Oncology should be of high quality, providing clinical investigation and career training for academic oncologists. In order to assure the quality goals of oncology, and in an attempt to meet an adequate supply of medical oncologists, the following guidelines are recommended. New training programs should be restricted to institutions with a demon!>trated cJn1mitn1ent to clinical and/or basic research. Purely clinical programs without a modern research component should be discouraged. To assure the quality of education, training should occur in institutions where the faculty writes papers, participates in research, and has research grants. Discontinue programs currently without fel\u00ad lows. (There arc seven such programs, four devoted.to clinical training only). Delete programs offering clinical training with only patient care delivery, but continue those offering clinical research. The academic model for the acquisition and pursuit of new kno\"lcdge requires a clinical investigative atti\u00ad tude. (Eighteen programs with only clinical experience have 25 fellows.

INTRODUCTION Medical oncology is a major subspecialty of internal medicine. Medical oncologists are physicians broadly tr8.ined in internal medicine who have special skills and refined clinical judgment in matters relating to neoplastic diseases. They are equipped to provide comprehensive assessment of the problems encountered in cancer and to coordinate the professional disciplines and modal\u00ad ities of treatment necessary for management of patients with cancer. As a result, medical oncology has had a significant impact on cancer education, cancer research, and the care of patients with cancer internationally. Con\u00ad cern has been expressed that there will be a surplus of medical oncologists in the near future, similar to the projected surplus of physicians in other specialities in the United States. Recognizing significant developments in the study of neoplasms and the treatment of patients afflicted with cancer, the American College of Physicians established a committee on cancer in 1957 to encourage participation of the internist in the care of patients with cancer. In 1969, the American Society of Clinical Oncology estab\u00ad lished a committee that emphasized the importance of the emerging role of the internist in cancer and the new field of medical oncology. The decision of the American Board of Internal Medicine in February 1971 to offer certifica\u00ad tion in the subspecialty of medical oncology was ap\u00ad . proved by the American Board of Medical Specialties in February 1972. \u00a9 1986 Alan R. Liss, Inc. The Subspecialty Committee on Medical Oncology of the American Board of Internal Medicine established requirements for certification in medical oncology and established goals for training in clinical medical oncology [ l]. The scope of subjects with direct relevance to clinical medical oncology was defined. With a sound foundation in internal medicine and a firm base in the principles of neoplastic diseases, the medical oncologist, serving pri\u00ad marily as' a consultant. was envisioned as an integrator of a team of health professionals that provides many scientific and clinical skills to prevent, detect, control, and cure cancer. Major educational efforts were under\u00ad taken to train medical oncologists to meet the national need and demand. An international need for medical oncologists was also apparent. Once the scope of medical oncology was defined, and with the development of new training programs for med\u00ad ical oncology, the Subspecialty Committee defined essen\u00ad tial guidelines for training [2]. These guidelines stressed that the training must make it possible for the physician to acquire the expertise to practice as a consultant in From the Division of Medical Oncology.

It was argued that trainees develop skills to function as primary care physicians. It was essential that training programs have an investiga\u00ad tional comiionent so that the trainee could learn the de\u00ad sign and interpretation of research studies, evaluate and interpret data, and develop competence in critical assess\u00ad ment of new therapies. These guidelines became the basis for the current guidelines employed by the Residency Review Committee in the process of accrediting subspe\u00ad cialty training programs in medical oncology. MANPOWER NEEDS IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY \u00b7 In undertaking the process of training and certifying internists as medical oncologist, attempts were made to estimate the total number of medical oncologists needed in the United States. Bergsagel [3] attempted to deter\u00ad mine the manpower status and future requirements for medical oncologists in the Province of Ontario, Canada. With the projected 1,813 new cancer cases per year in a population of 500,000, the medical oncology caseload was 845 patients. It was estimated that in an academic center, a medical oncologist would consult on JOO new patients per year with follow-up care on 60-80 patients. In a nonacademic center, a busy, experienced, well-or\u00ad ganized medical oncologist was estimated to be able to see 150 new oncology patients per year and do the fol\u00ad low-up care on 100-200 patients. Moser [4], in analyzing the workload of three medical oncologists, reported that 61 % of their patients had cancer. Each member of this group consulted on 87 new oncology patients per year and was involved in the management of 51 new oncology patients. In 1977, an assessment of manpower needs in selected clinical oncology specialties projected the estimated sup\u00ad ply ,and requirements for medical oncologists [5] (Table I). In 1976, the author conducted a survey of 75 institu\u00ad tions claiming medical oncology training programs. This revealed that 304 medical oncologists were in training and I, 266 had completed training programs. Based on the number of trainees and the number who had applied to take the certifying examinations in medical oncology, it was projected that every other year over 500 candidates would be eligible for certification of whom approxi\u00ad mately 75 % would be certified. Assuming a small rate of attrition, a goal of 2,000 medical oncologists would be attained by 1981. In actuality, after seven certifying ex\u00ad aminations by the American Board of Internal Medicine, 3,659 internists have been certified as medical oncolo\u00ad gists through 1985. At that rate, the projected need of 3,665 medical oncologists by 1985 was met. The Federated Council for Internal Medicine spon\u00ad sored a National Study of Internal Medicine Manpower. 382 'l'AHLE I. 1977 Eslin1ate of Supply and Need of Medical Oncologists (SJ oncolog~ 't983, projected deficiency in oncology manpower was antic\u00ad ipated by 1990. Many persons regarded the report as inadequate and the conclusions incorrect. It was antici\u00ad pated that at the current rate of training, there should be no deficiency of oncologists in 1990. Concerned with the increasing production of medical oncologists, the potential overproduction, and the impact of a surplus, the American Society of Clinical Oncology established a subcommittee of the Committee on Accre\u00ad ditation of Medical Oncology Training Programs. A fur\u00ad ther survey of medical onco10gy training programb was conducted to reassess the production estimates previously made and to project again the number of medical oncol\u00ad ogists available to meet the estimated requirements. METHODS AND MATERIALS During the fall of 1984, 154 medical oncology training programs were reviewed. A survey form was sent to each prog.ram director, and subsequently a second survey was sent to those programs claiming oncology-hematol\u00ad ogy combined programs. The total number was only 11 fewer than that reported in the National Study of Internal Medicine Manpower IX [6]. Of the 154 programs, 151 were operational. Three programs were not functional or had been discontinued. Two programs were in the process of being phased out but were included in the tabulation because trainees cur\u00ad rently were still in the training program. The total num\u00ad ber of programs offering a first-year training program in 1984 was 149. Following completion of the survey, the data were reviewed and a position statement was prepared. This statement was endorsed by the Board of Directors of American Society of Clinical Oncology and the Associa\u00ad tion of Directors of Medical Oncology Training Pro\u00ad grams [7, 8]. RESULTS Of the 151 operational programs, 49 were registered as medical oncology only. In these programs, there were 303 fellows, which was 40% of the total number of fellows. The combined oncology-hematology programs numbered 105. Of these, 27 offered separate training tracks, and 7.8 offered an optional choice of track. Three program offered a specific oncology track plus an on\u00ad cology-hematology tract. The total number of all the current trainees for 1984- 1985 was 796. A few of these were designated as being on a hematology track. The total number designated as medical oncology track trainees was 767, eliminating those known to be on a hematology track. The total number of available first-year positions was 374. Elimi\u00ad nating those who had chosen hematology training only, there were 316 first-year oncology trainees and 307 sec\u00ad ond-year oncology trainees (Table II). Although 374 first\u00ad year positions were listed as available, the number varies according to the total number of trainees. With an in\u00ad crease in second-or third-year trainees, the limitation of funding may temporarily decrease the number of first\u00ad year positions. A third-year trainee program _;,as offered by 132 pro\u00ad grams. However, only 69 of those programs had third\u00ad year trainees (52 %). The total number of third-year med\u00ad ical oncology trainees was 144. No third-year training was offered by 19 programs. Those 19 programs had only 35 trainees. Size of Individual Programs The number of trainees in various programs was re\u00ad corded (Table !II). Seven programs had no trainees; 19 had only one. The total number of programs having nine or fewer trainees was 134 (61.5%). Seventeen programs had 10 or more trainees. These 17 programs contained 301 trainees (38.5%). Six of these programs had 21-42 trainees, totalling 146 trainees (18.6% of the total number of trainees). 1986 Projection An attempt was made to determine the number of first\u00ad year positions planned for 1986. This was tabulated as 328. Plans to reduce the number of positions were stated in 15 programs, with a loss of 19 trainees. However, 11 programs were planned to increase their number of train\u00ad ees, totalling 11. Four of these programs had only one or no current trainee. It is apparent that there was no major plan for reduction of trainees. A few programs, however, emphasized that reduction in the number of trainees had already taken place prior to the survey year. Comments from Directors In the survey, some directors provided supplementary information regarding the nature of their program, rea\u00ad sons for changing the number of trainees, and comments Medical Onl\u00b7ology Munpower Supply 197 1'AHLE II.

For those directors who previously had reduced the number of trainees, a voluntary reduction was carried out because of national policy, as advised by the Ameri\u00ad can Society of Clinical Oncology because of perceived overproduction of medical oncologists or because of the oversupply of oncologists and superior programs in larger centers. SOrne centers reduced their program or were discontinuing it because of lack of funds or reduction in funds. One program that changed to an academic 3-year program reduced the number of first-year trainees and extended the duration of training. It altered the distribu\u00ad tion in the number of trainees with the same funding. With respect to planned increases in the number of trainees, the reasons included an increase in the clinical caseload of the institution, increased funding, or an in\u00ad crease in the number of academically oriented trainees. Combined Oncology-Hematology Programs In the follow-up survey, comments were made regard\u00ad ing the combined program. It was apparent that there are a wide variety of programs offered. The comments in\u00ad cluded such items as the following: \"Ninety percent of the fellows take the Oncology Boards\"; \"all trainees take a two-year Oncology program and a third year if they want Hematology\"; \"from a practical point, no trainee wants a straight two-year Hematology track.\" One pro\u00ad gram did not train 2-year trainees for hematology only. Often it was the fellow's decision to decide which track 383 198 Kennedy they wished to pursue, but some programs did not en\u00ad courage double certification. The nature of a few of these training programs appeared vague, and separate tracks were difficult to identify. During the evolution of medical oncology, the hema\u00ad tologists have treated patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma. With their expertise, it is anticipated that some will continue to do so. DISCUSSION Medical oncology has evolved to be one of the larger subspecialties of internal medicine in the United States. In a little over a decade, there has been an explosion of the number of medical oncologists that has had a signifi\u00ad cant impact on cancer education, cancer research, and the care of patients with cancer. To assess whether the \u00b7concern regarding the potential overproduction of trained \u00b7oncologists is real, a manpower survey of medical oncol\u00ad ogy programs provided data that can be a guide to the future needs in the training of medical oncologists. After the 1985 certifying examinations, there were 3 ,659 oncologists certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine. This is on target according to the estimates previously made. Approximately 750 candi\u00ad dates took the 1985 certifying examination, a number similar to the previous year. With the information of the current number of trainees, projections can be estimated through 1990. Two methods of calculations were em\u00ad ployed to establish a projected number: I. If there are 750 eligible candidates each year (based on approximately the same number the past two years), and there is a 75% pass rate, by 1989 there will be 4, 779 certified medical oncologists (Table IV). This would be far beyond the best-estimate requirement and 30 over the requirement for 1990 based on a 60-hour week doing 60 % oncology. 2. If a slightly larger figure for 1987 and 1989 is used, based on 310 first-year trainees, by 1989 the number of certified oncologists again would have exceeded the best-estimate requirement and be almost identical to the estimated requirement based on a 60-hour week doing 60 % oncology (Table Y). Certainly it would appear that by 1990 there will be no deficiency of medical oncologists. The exact number of noncertified oncologists practicing medical oncology is unknown. Moreover, with improved education, more primary physicians and other oncologists would be ad\u00ad ministering treatment. Utilizing the data from the Na\u00ad tional Manpower Survey, there were approximately 200 more trainees than those found in the current study (Table VI). Recognizing that there is some error in collection of data of this type and its interpretation, it is reasonable to assume that there will not be a deficiency of medical 'fABLE IV. l'rojet>lion of f\\.tedical Oncology Manpow~r Using Pasl Number of Eligible Candidates Year Candidate Passed 1983 1985 750 682 1987 750' 560\u00b0 1989 750' 560h uEstimatcs based on similar number for 1983 and 1985. bEstimated 75 % pass rate.

Training in medical oncology should be of high quality, providing clinical investigation and career training for academic oncologists, of which there is stated to be a lack of [ 10]. In order to assure the quality goals of oncology, and in an attempt to meet an adequate supply of medical oncologists, it seemed appropriate to establish guidelines for future training in mediCal oncology. A position statement was prepared, endorsed by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Clinical Oncol\u00ad ogy and the Association of Directors of Medical Oncol\u00ad ogy Training Programs [7,8 J: I. \"New training programs should be restricted to institutions with a demonstrated commitment to clini\u00ad cal and/or basic research. Purely clinical programs without a modern research component should be dis\u00ad couraged. To assure the quality of education, training should occur in institutions where the faculty write papers, participate in research, and have research grants.\" Comment: With the vast number of clinical oncolo\u00ad gists in practice, it is mandatory that basic and clinical research be expedited by providing qualified academic 384 oncologists to develop new innovative concepts of diag\u00ad nosis, treatment, and management. 2. \"Discontinue programs currently without fellows. In the survey there were 7 such programs, 4 devoted \u00b7to clinical training only.\" Comment: Such programs are meaningless. 3. \"Delete programs offering clinical training with only patient care delivery, but continue those offering clinical research. The academic model for the acqui\u00ad sition and pursuit of new knowledge requires a clini\u00ad cal investigative attitude. Patient care by the trainee should be a learning experience, The trainee should no\\ be utilized to serve a patient load.\" \u00b7_Comment: There were 18 programs with only clinical experience; 25 fellows were in these programs. One\u00ad trainee programs fail to provide good exchange of expe\u00ad riences between trainees. Programs that depend upon the trainee to take care of patients are \"using\" the trainee but not providing adequate training. _ 4. \"Delete programs where more than 4 subspecialties \u00b7 oflnternal Medicine and Radiation Therapy, Surgery and Pathology are not represented in the institution. The trainees require exchange of experiences with other specialties.\" 5. \"To reduce U.S. manpower excess, good foreign trainees should be attracted to U.S. training programs, but with a commitment to return to their homeland to 'extend benefits provided by Medical Oncology.\" Comment: Twenty percent of all trainees in fellowship training are either foreign medical graduates (FMG) or U .S.-FMGs. It is necessary that the United States extend 'its expertise to those countries in need of qualified oncologists. 6. \"Require the rotation of Internal Medicine residents to Oncology services to improve their training in Medicine.\" Comment: The cancer problem constitutes a major illness of the elderly, who make up an increasing part of internal medicine. Primary care physicians in internal medicine should be qualified to diagnose neoplastic dis\u00ad eases, teach prevention of cancer, and administer stan\u00ad dard therapies accurately. 7. \"Require more rigid definition of training programs in the combined Oncology-Hematology programs. There should be a clear definition of the separate \u00b7_training tracks and assurance of the quality of that training. Encourage combined programs to share ex\u00ad periences and facilities, but to maintain clear definition of the needs of each training track. The greatest pro\u00ad portionate increase (25 % ) in the number of entering fellows in all subspecialties between 1982 and 1983 was in these combined programs. \"[6]. 8. \"Focus on funding for academic programs. Train\u00ad . ing grants for fellows intent on research careers should be encouraged. There is a critical need to increase the Medical Oncology Manpower Supply 199 academic oncology base to help translate exciting de\u00ad velopments of basic research into clinical application.\" Comment: Table VII tabulates the source of funding for the oncology and oncology-hematology programs [6]. The oncology-hematology programs received their great\u00ad est funding from hospital revenue and Veteran Adminis\u00ad tration programs, whereas the oncology programs received their largest proportion from state and local governments. Almost $24 million a year is devoted to training in these two types of programs alone. Reduction of Veterans Administration clinical training programs could be substantial, yet the Veterans Administration's Associate Program for research training should not be impaired. 9. \"In order to meet the academic and research needs of Medical Oncology and provide mature oncologic \u00b7 physicians, 3-year training programs are needed.\" Comment: In view of the expanding information in medical oncology and the need to develop academic on\u00ad cologists, mandatory requirement of a 3-year training program in medical oncology would be advantageous. At least a minimum of 2 full years of pure medical oncology training should be 1c4uired. JO. \"Seek methods to encourage or force a reduction of the number of trainees in Oncology by directors of the programs, including the large programs. Ob\u00ad tain commitments from program directors for reduc\u00ad tion of the number of trainees.\" It has been proposed, for example, that the number be reduced up to 50% over 5 years. Comment: As indicated in the current survey, there appears to be no significant reduction in the forthcoming year of trltineeships. The number of internal medicine fellowship training programs and the number of trainees is at an all-time high, suggesting that fellowship training is not being internally regulated to control the number of subspecialists needed to meet appropriate manpower needs despite a perceived oversupply of such physicians [9]. Despite the fear that an oversupply of subspecialists could erode the patient base that teaching hospitals need for teaching and research, the direct9rs of the teaching hospitals and the subspeciality fellowship programs show TABLE VII.

The Council of Subspecialty Societies of the American College of Physicians has prepared a statement on man\u00ad power regarding the concern of a surplus of subspecialty physicians. This statement includes (a) recognizing there is a need to reduce the number of training positions in the various medical subspecialties, (b) supporting efforts in Congress to reduce the number of foreign medical graduates entering training programs (but would encour\u00ad age exchange visitors to return to their country of origin after training is completed), (c) limiting access to subspe\u00ad cialty training programs to exclude or severely limit access of U.S. citizens graduating from non-LCME-ap\u00ad proved schools, (d) development of more complete \u00b7guidelines that would be useful to the Residency Review Committee in establishing criteria for approval of train-\u00b7 mg programs for the subspecialty, and (e) continuation of support of the National Study of Internal Medicine Man\u00ad power. The statement has been endorsed by the American College of Physicians [II]. The Impact of Medical Oncology The explosion in the number of trained medical oncol\u00ad ogists has helped bring necessary oncology expertise to the community, so that modern and competent care of patients with cancer is available outside the research and university centers. The availability of this care system has coincided with the improved survival rules and cure rates of several cancers. There seems little doubt that the new oncologists are bringing the fledgling science to the people. Although initially trained to meet the need lo apply the product of research in chemotherapy to the care of patients with advanced stages of cancer, the medical oncologist is developing research to better understand disease biology aimed at developing more effective treat\u00ad ments. The medical oncologist has become a symbol of the cancer specialist, expected to provide judgment in total management of the patient with cancer. The increasing number of medical oncologists in the community has led to concern that clinical research at major research institutions will be altered. This is already true. With qualified oncologists in the community, the patient with cancer can remain closer to home and the cost is less. We can be proud of the accomplishment of improving the quality of community cancer care. Some regard these educational efforts as a self-destructive pro\u00ad cess of major medical cancer centers responsible for training and research. Certainly the methods of training and research will be altered. The research will be di\u00ad rected toward those cancers that still defy cure or even control. To stimulate the field of clinical research, train\u00ad ing programs should include investigation as an integral and required part of training [IO]. The medical oncologist in practice should continue to participate in clinical investigations. The chaotic nature of change to which medical care is currently being subjected, adds difficulty in determining the exact manpower need. The increasing number of female oncologists changes the calculated lifetime pro\u00ad ductivity. Women may spend fewer hours in work per week, fewer years in practice, and possibly more time with the average patient. With the calculated productivity of female physicians to be 78 % of their male counter\u00ad parts, the surplus of oncologists might be revised down\u00ad ward. In contrast, no one can predict the impact that might occur on manpower needs if a significant discovery occurred in a major cancer in which the treatment process would require additional physicians in order to attain control or cure of that disease. Furthermore, the actual numbers of medical oncologists in practice may be al-, tcred by the increasing number of women as well as men who may wish for shorter hours, physicians undergoing \"burn out\" and abandoning the field, and attrition (which will be small). The oncolegists certified in the past 12 years represent a young population of physicians and currently will lack the attrition by death that occurs in longer-established subspecialties such as cardiology. A continuing awareness of the need for medical on\u00ad cologists should be maintained so as not to surpass a reasonable number of skilled subspecialists. As the goal and nu1nbcrs of clinical n1c<lical oncologists needed is being attained, the distribution must also be considered. This requires the recognition of the need in communities in order to aid the placement of the medical oncologists. One of the most likely places for regulation will be the demand for medical services. As restraints are placed on medical services to reduce costs, the demand for oncology services may decrease [6]. Many consider the future of the physician pool to be a political question [12]. The health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are having a significant impact on national requirements for medical personnel. Projections based on the average ex\u00ad perience of three HM Os suggest that 50% fewer primary care physicians for adults will be needed to meet national primary care needs in 1990 than projected by the GMENAC [13]. Oncology Growth The medical oncologists assume a major responsibility for the care of the patient with cancer throughout the entire course of the illness. Of the existing clinical prac\u00ad tice fields of internal medicine, the one that seems sure to grow is medical oncology. It involves team effort collaborating with radiotherapists, surgeons, and other health providers. Since medical oncology appears to have 386 TABLE VIII.

KENNEDY, MD Abstract-The Medical Specialties Matching Program provides a n1eans for fellow~hip applicants and participating institutions 10 rank their pref crences. The firs1 a ti empt in 1986 resulted in a wide variation in the percentage of matched posi1ions according to specialty. For oncology, the programs ranged near the median, ie, of 255 enrolled positions, 207 (81.20\"/11) were actually offered. Of these, 148 (7 J.S0/11) were filled. In 76 programs, 61 t1J11 of the posi1ions were not rilled. Oncology direc1ors have expressed reluctance to participate in this Matching Program in 1he future. Under the management of the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP), ap\u00ad pointments in Medical Subspeciality Pro\u00ad grams were selected for 1987. This instituted, for the first time, an approach for the selec\u00ad tion of medical subspeciality fellows on a basis similar to that of selecting G-1 (ie, PGY-1) residents. The stated purpose of the Medical Specialties Matching Program was to allow all applicants seeking positions and participating institutions the opportunity to rank their pref\u00ad erences confidentially at a uniform date. The plan matches an applicant to the institution, which was ranked highest on the applicant's list, and which, in turn, had listed the appli\u00ad cant for a position. Only subspeciality pro\u00ad grams in accredited Departments of Medicine could offer positions. The plan was conceived to give prospective subspeciality fellows more time to develop their interests in a subspecial\u00ad ity area and to apply without pressure from program directors to commit themselves to a training program. In the fall of 1985, agreements were made available for the participation of applicants and subspeciality programs. The program agreements were submitted to the NRMP of- The author is Professor of Medicine, Masonic Pro\u00ad fessor of Oncology, and Director, Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Med\u00ad ical School, Minneapolis.

Program agreements and applicant agreements were received in the. NRMP office by March 26, 1986. The follow\u00ad ing 1nonth the applicants <ind j)rogru1n direc~ tors prepared their rank order list. These rank order lists were due in the NRMP office by May.23. The results of the match were deliv\u00ad ered on June 18, 1986.1 The Association of Medical Oncology Di\u00ad rectors agreed in 1985 to support the program and encouraged the program directors to par\u00ad ticipate. lt was anticipated that some prob\u00ad lems would evolve, and it was known that a few institutions had already decided not to participate. Of the Chairman of Departments of Medicine who joined the matching pro\u00ad gram, not all were unanimous in their sup\u00ad port. Various levels of participation were subsequently noted: 1. Divisions were instructed by departmen\u00ad tal chairpersons to participate in the program. 2. Divisions were offered the option of participating or not. 3. Some programs listed a few positions in the matching program, but retained other positions for appointments outside of the matching plan program. These were termed \"Swing positions.\" 4. A few Departments of Medicine chose not to participate. 5. Several cancer institutes did not par\u00ad ticipate. 90 li. J, KENN!oU'i In March, 1986 there was concern about the many oncology programs that were not participating in the matching plan. A meeting of Medical Oncology directors resulted in the conclusion that the matching program was not progressing satisfactorily, and that diverse methods of appointment were in process. Most apparent was the lack of participation by the National Cancer Institute. Others, feeling competitive to that institution, did not choose to participate in the matching program. The matching program was regarded as a good idea-if everyone joined. Therein, was the problem. The meeting concluded with this proposal: That notice be senl Immediately to all appropriate par\u00ad ticipants and agencies to establish early commilment for all available\" fellowship positions to be implemented as soon as possible effective-wilh the 1988 match and for suc\u00ad ceeding years. in May, 1986 at the meeting of the Association of Medical Oncology Directors, the attitude of the directors was almost totally opposite to that expressed one year earlier. In favor of the program was the support of the applicants: lhc matching program provided interviewing and selection of a first choice without the pres\u00ad sure from a program director asking for im\u00ad mediate commitment to a fellowship. This was deemed to be an advantage for the applicant. Opposition to the matching program ex\u00ad pressed the importance of a commitment to quality research. The program directors stressed the need for selecting a fellow to fit into the areas of a division's ongoing research program. Those directors preferred to select individual candidates and negotiate a position. Others compared the selection of a fellow to that of selecting a new faculty person. That person is selected because of many merits that would be necessary to support an oncology program. Second choices are often not ac\u00ad ceptable. Major defects in the matching pro\u00ad gram were expressed and included the lack of strong support by many professors of medi\u00ad cine, the non-participation of major cancer institutes, and the clear cheating in the sys- 389 tern. The philosophical conflict in regard to participation or lack of participation in the matching program was that of institutional preference versus support of the aJ'lplicant's interest; self-interest versus altruism. RESULTS OF THE MATCHING PROGRAM Analysis of the matching program results clearly indicates that not all subspeciality pro\u00ad grams participated in the matching plan, and not all available positions were submitted to the matching program. Initially 1304, or three\u00ad quarters of the 1736 training programs listed in the Federated Council of Internal Medicine (FCIM) Directory, enrolled in the matching program. After withdrawals from the plan, participation was 68.6 percent.1 The partici\u00ad pating institutions listed 2,434 training but in their Rank Order hsts, only 2,073 positions were offered, a decline of 15 per\u00ad cent. Initially 2,694 applicants registered, but only 2,240 (830Jo) submitted Rank Order lists. The 454 withdrawals most likely were offered positions, and accepted positions outside the n1atch. The General Internal Medicine pro\u00ad grams had lhc lowest number of offered posi\u00ad tions (39) in 22 participating institutions. Only 380Jo of those positions were filled. The more popular specialties fared well in matching. Gastroenterology, Cardiology, and Pulmonary had a high percent of match, 93.4%, 92.30Jo, and 85.3%, respectively. The lowest percent of match was in Endocrinology\u00ad Metabolism (52.50Jo) and Nephrology (530Jo). In those specialties, along with Geriatrics, over 800Jo of the programs failed to fill their quota. In Medical Oncology, 42 programs en\u00ad rolled but 7 withdrew (l 70/o decline). In He\u00ad matology-Oncology, 103 programs enrolled and 8 withdrew (80Jo decline). This repre\u00ad sented 58.30/o and 77.90/o respectively, of the programs listed in the FCIM roster (Table I). In Medical Oncology, of 35 enrolled pro\u00ad grams offering 45 positions, 690Jo matched. It was apparent that the lar.ger programs were Results or the rellowship matching plan 9t Table I.

In the combined Hematol\u00ad ogy/Oncology programs, with 95 enrolled pro\u00ad grams offering 162 positions, 720/o matched. Combining these figures, 71.50/o of the posi\u00ad tions offered were matched. There were 0.9 applicants for each position. Jn all, 7211/o of Medicai Oncology programs and 57% Hema\u00ad tology/Oncology programs failed to fill their quota. Combining these, 76 oncology pro\u00ad grams were unfilled (610/o). Of the 153 posi\u00ad tions offered by these programs, 48 (31 \"lo) were not matched. Comparison to the Oncology Training Program Registry These results were compared to the data on . available trainin\u00b7g positions previously accu\u00ad mulated in a Registry of Oncology Training Programs.'\" Of the 49 Medical Oncology Training Programs in the Registry, 35 (71%) enrolled in the matching program. In the 105 combined Hematology/Oncology programs, 95 enrolled (90\"7o ). Overall, of 154 Registry programs, 130 enrolled (84%). Apparently 28 programs made no effort to be listed in the Registry. Hence, data of th0 ose is not avail\u00ad able-explaining the discrepancy in the num\u00ad ber of total positions between the Registry and FCIM data. In the analysis of the Oncology Registry, Medical Oncology planned to offer 150 first\u00ad year positions in 1986.' However, only 45 actual positions were offered for the match\u00ad ing program for 1987, 30\"7o of the estimated first-year positions. In contrast, the combined Hematology/Oncology programs offered 162 390 (760/o) of 213 planned pos1t10ns. Totalling these two, of 363 potential first-year planned positions, 207 were offered for matching (570/o). This comparison of two sets of data demonstrates that many more positions are available than were enrolled. Since four major institutions in oncology training did not par\u00ad ticipate in the matching program, at least 43 positions were not entered for matching. It is apparent that institutional participation was relatively low in the Medical Oncology programs. DISCUSSION The results of the matching program dem\u00ad onstrate a wide variation in the percent of matched positions in the various subspeciali\u00ad ties. Gastroenterology, Cardiology, and Pul\u00ad monary did well, which a popularity of those subspccialities. The Oncology pro\u00ad gran1s ranged near lhc median. It is apparent that approximately 25 oncol\u00ad ogy programs (ie, Hematology/Oncology plus Medical Oncology) did not participate in the matching plan. Approximately 33\"7o of the onc~logy positions available were not listed by 15\"7o of the available programs. Some can\u00ad cer institutes did not participate. Although the number of programs in the FCIM roster and the ASCO Registry were different, the com\u00ad parison of information emphasizes that many more training positions are available than were enrolled in the matching plan.

The opinions expressed at the 1986 meeting of the Association of Directors of Oncology Programs-ie, ranging from favorable com\u00ad ments about the advantages from the appli cantsviewpoint, to criticisms based on unique qualifications of only certain applicants for a specific position -would suggest that in the forthcoming year, Oncology programs are less likely to participate in the matching program.

As the national accrediting body for pharmacy residency programs, ASHP is concerned about the impact that the forthcoming recommendations from the Council on Graduate Medical Education would have to these programs; we welcome the opportunity to provide the necessary information to the Council to ensure that modifications to the current system do not adversely affect pharmacy education. Toward that end, ASHP is pleased to provide the Council with the following information about pharmacy residencies and their contribution to this country's health-care delivery system. A pharmacy residency is a postgraduate program of organized training in the institutional environment. Its foremost objectives are (a) to provide practical experience to residents in the coordination of total pharmaceutical services within an institution and (b) to provide a broad range of in-depth experiences designed to advance the residents' level of knowledge and enhance their ability to promote new and improved pharmacy services. The long-term cost effectiveness of graduate medical education is well established. In particular, the contribution of pharmacy residency programs to the nation's health-care system far exceeds its costs to the federal government. Most of today's institutional pharmacy leaders are graduates of residency programs; these exemplary practitioners are engaged in far more than traditional dispensing activities. They are responsible for such cost-effective pharmacy programs as implementing adverse drug reaction monitoring programs for patient safety, reviewing the therapeutic efficiency of prescribed medications, and fostering safe and effective utilization of modern pharmaceuticals. It is generally recognized that today's high level of patient-oriented pharmaceutical services in institutions has been made 393 Paul M. Schwab 11-9-87 Page Two possible through the knowledge and skills that were acquired during the residency program. Today's pharmacy residents will become tomorrow's pharmacy leaders who will continue to make positive, progressive, advances in the delivery of high quality, cost-effective health care. The contributions of pharmacy residency programs to the nation's health-care system in general, and Medicare beneficiaries in particular, far exceeds its short-term costs to the federal governinent and other third-party payers. A review of Medicare funding for pharmacy residency programs will demonstrate their cost effectiveness. In total, there are approximately 360 residents being trained in 125 non-government hospitals that receive Medicare funds. In 1986, the total cost to these institutions for providing pharmacy residency programs was $10,516,000. However, this is not the total cost to Medicare. Assuming an average hospital Medicare population per hospital of 30 percent, the amount reim\u00ad bursable to hospitals from Medicare for training pharmacy residents was only $3,154,800. Thus, the cost to Medicare for training pharmacy residents becomes minimal when compared to the cost for total funding of non-physician health professional training programs. In fact, our estimate is that institutional pharmacy residency training constitutes about one percent of the total cost to Medicare of health professional training. Although pharmacy residency programs cost the federal government a very small amount of money, the elimination of those funds would cause severe damage to the existence of institutional pharmacy residency programs. A recent survey of ASHP's pharmacy program preceptors showed that 62 percent of these institutions would be forced to limit or eliminate their pharmacy residency programs if Medicare funding were terminated. In this era of cost containment, the training of individuals who are committed to providing the best quality health care available in the most cost-effective manner has become critical. Consistent with this goal, ASHP urges the Council on Graduate Medical Education to consider the value of pharmacy residency programs to patient care as they finalize their recom\u00ad mendations to change graduate medical education program's scope and funding, Should you need any further information regarding this matter, please do not hesitate to contact us.

This Association is organized primarily for the purpose of improving the quality of graduate surgical education. We appreciate the privilege of submitting a statement to the Council on Graduate Medical Education to be considered for the forthcoming public hearing. The APDS 'wishes to go on record in support of the concept that graduate education in surgery requires a minimum period of five years following completion of medical school. Previous attempts to shorten the length of surgical training have not been successful. The complexity of the clinical practice of surgery and of the care of surgical patients are increasing rapidly. Surgical residents are expected to acquire not only the knowledge and the technical ski 11 to master the care of surgical patients, but they must al so acquire the clinical maturity and the judgment to allow them to function safely as independent practitioners. It is the development of this maturity and judgment that cannot be hurried and that makes the difference in the quality of care for surgical patients. In our view, this maturing process requires a minimum of five years of training, and sometimes requires more. We, therefore, urge that the minimun period of surgical education be maintained at five years, and that reduct i ans in this amount of ti me not be supported by COGME. Thank you. s~~~el~ y~urs, ~cc(~---- Paul Friedmann, M.D. President 395 Statement Sul:mitted to the Council of Graduate Medical Education November 19, 1987 Public Hearing by Dr. Martin Dillard Assistant Dean for Clinical Affairs Assistant Medical Director Clinical Affairs Howard University Hospital Assisted by Marilyn Johnson Legislative Analyst Howard University 3 97 Introduction Thank you for the opportunity to present our views on subjects to be considered by the Council on Graduate Medical Education. The Howard University Hospital and College of Medicine, located in Washington, D.C., have a special mission to provide education to minority physicians and to provide medical care for indigent patients. Because of this we have a special concern about the supply and distribution of j:ilysicians in the United States and about current and future shortages or excesses of physicians. In the interest of presenting our concerns in a concise manner, this statement will concentrate on these two topics. We are also concerned, however, about the other issues being addressed by the Council. Consequently, we have included a copy of testimony on Medicare Financ\u00ad ing of Graduate Medical Education sul::mitted to the Senate Finance Coornittee on June 10, 1985 by Mr. Haynes Rice our Hospital Administrator and stand ready to provide any additional information your panel deems appropriate. History Congress first addressed concerns over the adequate supply of health profes\u00ad sionals in the Heal th Professions Educational Assistance Act of 1963. This legis\u00ad lation provided comprehensive, federal funding assistance to qualifying students and medical education institutions. Because of testimony that a shortage of physicians continued to exist, Congress in 1970 passed Public Law 91-$23 1 the Einergency Health Personnel Act. This legislation provided direct financial support for medical education in exchange for a promise to practice in health manpower shortage areas after the completion of training. Other legislation passed in the same era provided federal support for the health professions schools in financial distress and grant support for certain types of postgraduate train\u00ad ing programs to physicians providing primary care. The results of these legisla\u00ad tive acts was a drama tic increase in the number of physicians trained annually. 398 2 This rapid growth in the population of practicing physicians combined with the dramatic and persistent increase in heal th care costs have led to the current perception that there is an oversupply of physicians in the United States and that the national interest requires steps to control and perhaps reduce the number of new physicians being produced. We would agree that increasing the total number of physicians may be detrimental to the overall medical profession. We also admit that, as practi- tioners, we are best served financially by action which would keep the supply of doctors low. We must, however, in this instance, speak on behalf of the consumer because of our special interest in providing medical care in areas populated by minorities and indigent patients. The report of the Graduate Medical Education National Advisory Coornittee predicted a surplus of physicians in the United States by 1990. The major report did not address the need for minority physicians as a separate issue. An attempt was made to correct this oversight by a supplementary report but this report never' received publicity and discussion which it deserved. Other studies examin- ing the question of physician manpower are guilty of the same oversight including the one currently in progress unde.r the direction of the American Medical Associ- a ti on. Discussion I. The Expected Effect of Current Policies and Present Trends on Future Physician Supply The need to protect and even increase the numbers of minority physicians arises not only from questions of fairness and equity but also from evidence that minority physicians are more likely to practice in underserved areas and to accept indigent patients into their practice. A report of a survey done of graduates of the Howard University College of Medicine supports these statements and is attached for reference. There are other factors which we believe will 399 3 also threaten the future supply of minority physicians and we would like to list these now. A. Many of the persons who would have chosen careers in medicine in the past are now opting for more lucrative careers in engineering, law, computer science and finance. B. Individuals formerly interested in helping mankind by setting up small, intimate practices, are forced by econcmics to try to acquire existing practices, join existing practices, or work in HMO's because it is very difficult and time consuming to build up large practices that can support the large medical education bills they have accumulated. C. Reports of large malpractice suits and exuberant malpractice insurance rates are not only discouraging prospective students from entering the field, they are also forcing many practicing physicians to leave or change their fields. D. Urban and rural areas are serviced by minorities and foreign medical graduates. Current policies are reducing the number of FMG' s who are allowed to enter this country while, at the same time, fewer minorities are entering medical school. E. Heal th care consumers are increasingly opting to take advantage of HMO' s instead of heal th plans like Blue Cross/Blue Shield; thereby reducing the number of persons using non-participating public and private medical facilities. II. The Effect New Technologies, Scientific Breakthroughs, New Diseases, and Dem:>graphic Changes Will Have on Manpower Needs. In the past, new diseases were not likely to be a factor in the supply of medical \u00b7personnel. This situation has changed drastically since the onset of the AIDS epidemic. This disease disproportionately affects the minority cormrunity. Also the long term cost of treating persons with this disease frequently forces 400 4 them to require care for which they have no means to pay. Again minority physicians are most likely to provide the needed care. Finally, we want to address this topic as it relates to the geriatric popula- tion. There is little question that in the next decade the focus of the nation's medical problem will be different. Millions of elderly citizens are living beyond the life expectancy of 10 years ago. Practicing physicians will, therefore, have to expand their knowledge and skills in order to adequately care for this sector of society. The increase in this population group with their documented need for primary care physicians underlines the lleed to assure that those mem- bers of the physician segment most likely to provide that care receive the public's encouraganent and support. III. The Impact Rising Medical Education Expenses Will Have on Prospective Students, Especially those from Underrepresented Groups The costs associated with higher education have increased drastically in recent years. At the same time, federal student assistance has been reduced. Fears that education will again become an option for only the rich are fueled by these events. If it is true that persons are more inclined to pursue careers which bring a return on their investment in as short a time frame as possible, why would one be tempted in light of the other unfavorable circumstances we have highlighted with regard to the health profession to choose it? More importantly, those persoos for whom we have expressed particular concern (minority students and minority patients) are being doubly impacted by the cur\u00ad rent trends and are singled _c;>,\\lt in this text because they are least able to afford higher education, and least able to complete their training without special support. Many persons would advocate that the natioo would be better served by ignoring that sector of the population and letting those persons better prepared for medical school occupy the limited spots which are available. 401 5 We ask to you, however, if those who are better prepared financially and academically likely to practice in a ghetto or rural hospital? And if by chance they ignore the fact that they need to make a lot of money to pay their educa- tional bills, are they going to be as sensitive to and perceptive alnut the cadre of needs of patients living in those corrmuni ties? Are they likely to teach in university-affiliated schools which have large minority student bodies? History has indicated that they won't and information documenting the facts have been included in the paper presented by Mr. Sterling Lloyd our Assistant Dean for Student Affairs on September 25, 1987 which is attached for your review and consideration. IV. Reconrnended Polici Changes in Public/Private Sectors Which Can Effectively Deal with Projected Imbalances in Physician Supply Recoomendations to increase the numbers of persons entering and staying in the medical field include a restructuring of the malpractice insurance statutes; a loan forgiveness program for any qualified medical student who agrees to work in an underserved area; the availability of public and private funding and tech- nical assistance for persons wishing to start new practices; and, programs to encourage all qualified minority students to enter medical school. It is our premise, however, the most beneficial policy changes would surround those aimed at increasing the number of persons fran traditionally underrepresented groups. Specific suggestions on how this can effectively be accomplished has been compiled by Sterling Lloyd. Jlre..College Recoomendations 1.

ALUMNI ASSOCIATION 15600 San Pedro San Antonio, Texas 78232 (512) 490-9818 TESTIMONY TO CO!?l-IE ON Novemb~r 19, 1987 The U.A.G. Alumni Association is an association of physicians who have graduated from the School of Medicine of the Autono\u00ad mous University of Guadalajara. We were established in 1974 and have been active in promoting equal opportunity in train\u00ad ing and licensure for foreign medical graduates ever since. Frankly, when the appointments to the Council on Graduate Medical Education were announced, our Board of Trustees waited with some trepidation for the outcome of the first meeting. Our experiences with the Graduate Medical Edu\u00ad cation National Advisory Cormiittee and with the GAO had not led us to expect open-mindedness and complete fairness in the discussion of issues surrounding foreign medical graduates in graduate medical education and licensure. You can imagine the very pleasant surprise we received following the first public meeting of this Council. It became quite clear that, unlike GMENAC, this Council was not going to reco1TTTiend immediate and sweeping changes in both the structure and funding of graduate medical educa- ti on. 407 It was equally clear that this Council was not going to blandly follow old and well-traveled roads in order to come up with a slightly different re-hash of past policies. Instead, the Council as a whole and this Subcommittee have turned with fresh and open minds to clearly define the pro\u00ad blems which face graduate medical education and to make re\u00ad commendations for approaches to solving those problems which combine practicality with achievability. These recommenda\u00ad tions achieve one other milestone: They do not appear to favor any one particular constituency. Foreign medical graduates have made multitudinous contribu\u00ad tions to medicine in the United States. By and large, they have been well integrated into the fabric of American medi\u00ad cine, despite laws and regulations which are biased against them and frequent forms of not too subtle discrimination. Although we are sure this Subcommittee has read and heard many statistics and reports both pro and con concerning the foreign medical graduate, we would like to mention just a few points for consideration which we feel are important. We have all kinds of programs for minoriti~s, from bi- 1 ingual education to multi-language ballots in the voting booth, but we have failed to address the issue of health 1+08 care for the non-Eng]ish speaking citizen. One of the fastest growing groups are those who share Spanish as a native language. A 1980 study by by the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development on integration of USFMGs into medicine in Cal ifo.rni a found a very high degree of utilization of Spanish in.direct patient care, a finding which was influential in the continuing of a special train\u00ad ing program known as Fifth Pathway in that State. Internal surveys by this Association have found an equally high degree of utilization of Spanish in patient care among members of our organization on a nationwide basis. How do you measure the benefit a patient derives from being treated by a physician who shares the same language or cultural background? What of the contribution the FMG makes to the medical corrrnunity? For assistance,\u00b7we turned to the AMA Guide entitled Foreign Medical Graduates, 1986. Although they mare up less than 25% of the physician population, 12.9% are in full-time teaching positions, compared to only l.5% of U.S. educated physicians. An interesting anomaly is it not? Those same medical schools which discourage their teaching hospitals from accepting FMGs into residency do 409 not display the same reluctance in appointing FMGs to faculty positions. This same source indicates that FMGs make up 25% of those physicians engaged in f\\Jll-time research - a percentage consistent with their share of the physician population. There is no evidence that FMGs make poor residents. There is no evidence that FMGs provide shoddy health care. Indeed, what data there is available suggests that it is the U.S. educated physician who is more likely to be sued for malpractice, to be disciplined by his\u00b7 or her state medical board, or to have his or her license revoked. The U.S. medical co111Tiunity is justifiably proud of the quality of medical care available in the United States. Let us not forget that FMGs have contributed to this excellence. We appreciate the complexity of the issues which this Subcommittee has had to consider. You are to be con\u00ad gratulated on a concise rendering of this complex issue into clearly understood principles. Unless there are substantive changes in the prelim.inary conclusions of the Council on Graduate Medical Education 410 and its Subcommittees, our Association will support its fi na 1 report. 411 P .L.A.S.M.A. PARENTS LEAGUE OF AMERICAN STUDENTS OF MEDICINE ABROAD A Non-Profit Organization 63 N. Lake Drive West End, New Jersey 07740 Samuel N. Feinsod, M.D. President We appreciate the opportunity to present this testimony to the Council on Graduate Medical Education. We ask that it be considered as part of the public testimony at the Public Hearing of November 19, 1987 .. When we reviewed the charge to the Council and the minutes of its past meetings, we realized that the Council is endeavoring to its utmost to fulfill in a most re\u00ad sponsible manner the broad charge that has been assigned to it by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. We applaud the committee members for their willingness to give so generously of their time and energies to this important assignment. As President of the Parents League of American Students of Medicine Abroad, I want to assure you that while we plead the cause,.of foreign medical graduates, we do not intend that that cause be served at the expense of quality medical care in this country. With this in mind, we wish to make the following recommendations to you: 1. Foreign medical graduates must have equal opportunity for access to graduate medical training in this country. No one can argue that admission to American medical schools is always granted to those who will make the best doctors. It is likely that because of this a considerable number of potentially superior doctors are denied access to medical education in this country. Those who are especially motivated seek training in other countries. When they return after earning their degree, they ar<e ~.entitled to be evaluated fairly when they apply for graduate training. If they are not, not only do they suffer great harm, but citi\u00ad zens seeking medical care here are deprived of their services. 2. In order to evaluate all applicants for graduate med,ical education by the same standard, it is imperative that the same examination be used to satisfy requirements for admission. The stubborn resistance to arguments that requiring a different examination of foreign medical graduates is discriminatory leaves us puzzled as to what the establishment is afraid of. 3. We are leery of proposals which suggest accomplishing a reduction of residency positions by replacing residents with nonphysician service providers. 413 2 PARRNrS LEAGUE OF AMERICAN STUDENTS OF MEDICINE ABROAD We believe this would reduce the quality of care delivered. This is most likely to occur where there are large numbers of indigent patients. On the other hand, replacing residents with full-time health professionals would result in appreciably higher costs than under present practice. 4. We believe that American citizens who study abroad and then return here for graduate training must not be deprived of that opportunity by non-citizen for\u00ad eign medical graduates. To satisfy the United States' objective of providing train\u00ad ing for exchange visitor physicians, we should set up programs with goals consistent with the needs of these applicants and paid for, whenever possible, by the countries of origin. When funds are not available in those countries, as in many third world na'tions, alternate grants should be provided, In summary, I wish to state that we support all efforts to improve the effic\u00ad iency of the health care delivery system in this country. We urge that you approach your task by evaluating carefully what each segment of the medical community has to contribute. When you do this without regard to who lobbies hardest, we are confi\u00ad dent that you will agree that the foreign medical graduate should continue to play a significant role in our health care system. Thank you for this opportunity to present PLASMA's views to the committee. ~ I Samuel N. Feinsod, President 414 SAN JUAN BAUTISTA SCHOOL OF .MEDICINE November 13, 1987 Mr. Paul M. Schwab Executive Secretary Council on Graduate Medical Educatibn Health and Human Resources Administration 5600 Fishers Lane Brockfield, Maryland 20857 Dear Mr. Schwab: The San Juan Bautista School of Medicine appreciates the opportunity it has received from the Council on Graduate Medical Education to present a summary of its efforts to offer a solution to the shortage of adequate health care for the underpriviledged both in the United States and in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. San Juan Bautista (SJB) established in 1979 as specific objectives: is a young, a non-profit developing corporation institution with five *To offer a four-year program of excellent medical education and clinical training to students who will be able ~o perform the health services required by both the Island population and the Hispanic population in the United States. 1<To offer a medical education with a focus on prevention and primary health programs. *To establish a solid program of family medicine which will train and motivate physicians to improve the Island's health care and the health of the Hispanic population of the United States. *To train medical students to solve emotional, environmental, nutritional and community problems. 1,To off er qua l i Lied Puerto Rican students the opportunity of studying \"\"'dicine in their own country thus avoiding the high econ ~ic and emotional costs of studying abroad. The School is duly : :censed by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and accredited by-i ~, Council of Higher Education. It has a formal affiliation ~icn McGill University for faculty and student exchange programs rnd joint research ventures which will emphasize AIDS projecc:s, tropical diseases, nutrition and primary care delivery. 415 Since its establishment, the School has conferred 247 medical degrees. Its graduates have been accepted in nationally accredited internship and residency programs in Puerto Rico and the United States. Around 72% of our students approved the Puerto Rico State Board Examination of April 1987. Additionally a total of 23 students have been \u00b7admitted in advanced standing to the three LCME accredited schools in Puerto Rico. San Juan Bautista is also satisfying a growing demand for medical studies which has been partially met by foreign medical schools. Each year hundreds of students must travel to overseas schools in Mexico, Spain and, increasingly, in nearby Caribbean countries where students face high tuition fees as well as travel and living expenditures which often do not reflect the quality of education. Once they return to Puerto Rico many of them cannot pass the State Boards or find it hard to adjust to the strict requirements of residency programs. San Juan Bautista offers the alternative of a first-rate education on the Island without the economic and social consequences of studying at foreign schools which often lack effective quality controls. San Juan Bautista is currently seeking accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education of the American Medical Association and is in the process of implementing its recommendations. A visit by the Committee is scheduled for 1988. In its efforts to seek national accreditation, the School is fully backed by the Commonwealth's department of health and its secretary, Dr. Luis Izquierdo-Mora. They believe San Juan Bautista is a valuable source of family and general medicine practitioners, sorely needed specialties in Puerto Rico's current health delivery programs aimed at the 2.2 million U.S. citizens who are Island residents and classified as medically indigent. In a letter of 'upport written by Dr. Izquierdo-Mora to Congressman Jaime tl. Fuster which was printed in the enclosed copy of the Congressional Record (House of Representatives, 8-4-87), the secrc~.1ry explained that traditionally in Puerto Rico general pract:. c' and family physicians have come from the ranks of foreign me\u00b7!' ,\u00b7al schools graduates. In fact, the latest available statisti~\u00b7 n physicians in Puerto Rico (1982) reflect that 84% of gener;1: :ractitioners and 40% of family doctors are graduates of these nools. 416 The secretary went on to explain that recent changes in medical education have limited the number of physicians allowed to practice medicine in Puerto Rico and graduates of only seven foreign,\u00b7.medical schools are now allowed to take the State Board Examinations. Currently the Foreign Medical Graduate Examination in the Medical Sciences (FMGEMS)' is a requisite to take the Puerto Rico State Boards. Although these changes were certainly necessary to uphold a high standard of quality care, the fact remains that the public health system \u00b7.now needs even more qualified general and family physicians and the traditional sources for these doctors have narrowed.down. Since San Juan Bautista is currently emphasizing family medicine in its curriculum, many graduates are choosing family or general medicine as their career choice thus making the School a valuable source of these needed specialties at a crucial point in the Island's health delivery efforts. U. S. HISPANIC POPULATION As stated in its objectives, SJB .seeks to improve, not only the health of the residents of Puerto Rico, but also to make a definite contribution to the betterment of the health of U. S. Hispanics, currently estimated at around 8/o of the population and expected to double in size within 25 years. Because of cultural and language bonds, SJB graduates are in a unique position to help this group which, according to all available reports, still lacks adequate and comprehensive medical care. In fact, a health and human services task force concluded in 1985 that 60,000 more blacks and other minorities die in the U. S. than would die if they had the same age-adjusted death rates as other groups. Numerous studies attribute much of this disparity to the lack of access of minorities to adequate health care. The same studies show that the largest number of health professionals serving blacks and other minorities were indeed minority health professionals. A 198) New England Journal of Medicine article on affirmative action in medical schools (Keith SN, .et al, NEJM, December 12, 1985) reported that minority graduates were twice as likely to be practicing in underpriviledged areas than their ,, \".inority counterparts. It is precisely this area 1/~~ JM fl~ \"' \"\"\"'\"' r, 1 E:)as 417 graduates can make a definite contribution. Since there is a clear tendency for SJB graduates to seek post-graduate training opportunities in the United States and because of language and cultural similarities, they have a definite advantage and could conceivably prompt more members of this minority to seek adequate medical care. This assumption finds support in a number of studies that show that the ethnic make up of the patient population often reflects the ethnic background of their physician. For example, the above-mentioned New England Journal of Medicine article explained that, in their sample, Hispanic patients represented a greater proportion of patients seen by Hispanic physicians than by any other racial or ethnic group of physicians. MINORITY MEDICAL EDUCATION A review of minority medical education in the U. S. points to the fact that Federal Government attention has been primarily directed at institutions that have been training black health professionals. Even with the growing trend of Hispanic population size and lack of regular health care, this group is dramatically underrepresented in U. S. medical schools with a 2.4% enrollment which is declining. Two reasons are cited for this. First, is lack of money. Even when Hispanics are indeed accepted at some of the best medical schools, in many c:ises they simply cannot afford to attend. Another important fact is that while there are several black medical schools in t Cie nation, there are no Hispanic schools in the U. S. mainland. In Puerto Rico we ~.1n offer a solution to this growing problem. San Juan Bautista, : ., particular, is in an ideal position to fill the existing need ' Hispanic general and family physicians but we need help. First, we must students a cont' education.

S. and would 418 help our students qualify for federal government assistance that would enable more qualified applicants socioeconomic backgrounds to pursue medical careers. financial from low However to complete the strict Liaison Committee requirements, we need 'Federal Government assistanc~. We have taken our petition to Congress and received a favo_rabl.e reaction from Congressmen Richardson (D-N.M.), Waxman (D-California) and Fuster (Puerto Rico) (see Congressional Record House, 8-4-87). In fact, Congressman Waxman who is also the Chairman of the Sub-committee on Health and the Environment, acknowledged his intention to address the health needs of the Hispanic population by fostering the training of increased number of Hispanic health professionals when Title VII of the Public Health Service Act comes up for review. We also want to present our request to this Council for one time start-up funding of $1.3 million to improve our facilities and equipment, an area to which the Liaison Committee has assigned top priority and on which the School is working diligently. The request is similar to the start-up assistance given by the Federal Government to the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, the first predominantly black medical school founded in this century. The assistance helped add much-needed facilities and plan a four-year program that led to accreditation. CONCLUSION Summing up, it is our feeling that the San Juan Bautista School of Medicine is in an excellent position to help improve the health needs of U. S. citizens who are residents of Puerto Rico. While it could be argued that the supply of physicians in both the U. S. and Puerto Rico could theoretically handle the needs of the population, the fact remains that the existing distribution of medical manpower leaves a considerable segment of our citizens without adequate medical care. The government of Puerto Rico has conceived a plan which addresses this problem and relies on SJB students and graduates for successful implementation. In the U. S.,minorities continued to be underserved. Conceivably, as studies point out, health care for this group could improve by increasing the pool of available minority physicians. While considerable attent inn has been given to the problems of the black population, it is felt that the growing Hispanic group merits special consideration to avoid what could become a ,~\\,~ I \u00ab '\\- r \u00a3~ 419 critical problem of public health. The nation needs more Hispanic physicians to work with the growing Hispanic population;\u00b7 The bilingual graduates of San Juan Bautista School of Medicine, many of whom are currently serving this group, could make an increasingly meaningful contribution to the improvement of the health of the nation's Hispanics; There is an added benefit for this growing minority. By having more Hispanic doctors available for treatment, their freedom to choose their physician would be enlarged thereby upholding what has been a guiding principle of U. S. health care delivery. Cordially, JU President lao Enclosure 420 WRITTEN TESTIMONY TO COUNCIL ON GRADUATE MEDICAL EDUCATION For: Public Hearing, November 19, 1987 From: Society of Teachers of Family Medicine The \"Supply and Requirements for Family Physicians\" (Dr. Marjorie A. Bowman, June 1987) and the \"Financing of Training Programs for Family Medicine\" (Dr. Jack Col will, September 1987) have been reviewed before the Council on Graduate Medical Education. This written testimony will reiterate various findings by these individuals and present conclusions based on those findings. 1. Family physicians/general practitioners have not increased at the same rate as other specialties because of limited numbers of training positions. Between 1975 and 1985, the total number of family physician I general practitioners increased by 23 percent while total physicians increased by 40 percent and physicians in internal medicine increased by 66 percent. If current trends continue, the percentage of all physicians who are general/family physicians will remain at the current level of 12 percent of the physician population. 2. Family physicians are distributed better geographically in relationship to the overall population than are other specialists. \u00b7Thirty percent of family physicians practice in nonmetropolitan counties (non-SMSA) compared with 11 percent of all other physicians. About half of family 421 practice resident graduates stay in areas with less than 50,000 population. 3. Family physicians are in great demand. This demand seems particularly strong both in developing organized systems of health delivery as wel I as in rural areas. Some estimate conservatively that there are at least three times the number of positions available as graduating residents. 4. Medical student interest in family practice remains strong. Ninety-six percent of residency positions are filled and only 12. 9 percent of positions are filled by foreign medical graduates (compared to 16.8% for all specialties). 5. Recently trained family physicians have a different scope of practice from that of the former general practitioner. Residency trained family physicians continue to serve all ages and both sexes and continue to be distributed better in relationship to the overal I population than other specialties. However, they spend more time with each patient, more time in preventive care, more time in counseling and less time in surgical procedures than their predecessors. 6. The precarious funding of family practice education jeopardizes the potential future supply of family physicians. Funding difficulties relate both to the reduced income potential of primary care and the amount of education in the ambulatory setting where training is inherently less efficient and more costly. Approximately one-third of program costs must be met through government support. The current plateauing of 422 residency positions in family medicine results from a plateauing in governmental support at both the state and national level. CONCLUSIONS 1. There are insufficient numbers of family physicians in relationship to the physician population and to the needs of the American public. 2. There should be expansion in residency positions for family practice with appropriate funding. 3. Incentives must be provided to assist hospitals/institutions in expanding residency education in family medicine. These should take the form of: A. Enhancement of training grants under Title VII of the Public Health Service act for family practice residency programs. B. Increased Medicare reimbursement for residency education in family practice in relationship to other specialties which are in surplus. C. Incentives to states to initiate or expand state support for residency education in family practice. 4. COGME should investigate the impacts of the oversupply of physicians. An oversupply of physicians can encourage geographic diffusion of physicians thus increasing access to care. Potential negative effects of a physician oversupply are: insufficient procedures per physician to 423 maintain competence; increased iatrogenic disease; increased costs; possible physicians practicing outside of the area of their training; and possible encouragement of unethical behavior on the part of the physicians. Certainly, at some level, more physicians will add little to improving the health of the American people, i.e., decreased return for the input. 424 Mahendr S. Kochar. M.D. Assoc1ele Dean Mr. Paul M. Schwab Executive Secretary ~ MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN October 8, 1987 Council on Graduate Medical Education Health Resources and Services Administration 5600 Fishers Lane, Room 14-05 Rockville, MD 20857 Dear Mr. Schwab: Olhce ot Graduate Medical Education I would like to offer the following written testimony for consideration by the Council. My comments pertain to the issue of forei~m medical graduates. 1. Many of the foreign graduates who were born outside of the United States and have now become U.S. citizens have excelled both in the practice of medicine as well as the academics. Many American Nobel laureates in medicine have been foreign born and graduates of foreign medical schools and many American born Nobel laureates were trained by foreign graduates. I am myself a foreign graduate and now serve as Associate Dean for Graduate Medical Education at the Medical College of Wisconsin. There is no evidence whatsoever that those foreign graduates who have gone into practice perform worse than the American graduates or have more malpractice suits against them. In many instances patients prefer foreign medical graduates over American graduates because they claim that foreign graduates listen to them more and are more humane in their approach. 2. Although the AMA and AAMC are generally unenthusiastic about foreign graduates receiving training or settling in the United States, it is in the interest of the American public that the doors be kept open for the foreign graduates to seek training and even settle in the United States. I believe that the current ECFMG and FLEX examinations guarantee that only the best foreign graduates receive graduate medical training in the United States and it is not necessary to create further obstacles in .their path. 3. Foreign graduates who return to their countries of birth often refer patients back to the United States for medical care when it is not available in their home countries. This generates 425 foreign exchange for the U.S. As the economy of the United States shifts from a manufacturing to a service economy, these referrals help generate foreign exchange for the country. 4. Foreign graduates often enter graduate medical education programs that happen to be less desirable to the American graduates at any given time. This used to be the case with Physical Medicine, Psy\u00ad chiatry, and Anesthesiology in the 160s and '70s, and now is the case with Pediatrics and Internal Medicine. Currently more than 30 per cent of the board certified anesthesiologists, psychiatrists and physiatrists in the United States are foreign graduates. Many foreign graduates in these specialties are considered the very best in the field, 5. Unfortunately, the issue of foreign graduates is being politicized and I urge the Council to look at it objectively from the point of view of the American public, which is rapidly aging and would require humane and low tech care as opposed to the procedure\u00ad oriented high tech and expensive care that attracts the American graduates, As the cost of medical education rises, the number \u00b7 of applicants to the U.S. medical schools is falling, This in itself is a good enough reason to keep the doors open for the foreign medical graduates. America has come to be what she is because of her highly motivated, hard working immigrants who have come to this land seeking greater opportuni\u00ad ties and, in turn, have added to her glory. It would be inappropriate to shut off or diminish this infusion of brain power into the United States. MSK:eco Sincerely yours, (\\' C\\ 'I 0 r (\\_W,V\\.i1<' J 1'~Ch11./r MAHENDR S.

The relevant areas have been highlighted for easy reference. If I can provide additional information, please contact me. Sincerely, or~ B. F. Overholt, M. D. BFO:mb Enclosure 427 Presidential address 1984 Gastrointestinal endoscopy in the 1980s: cost, challenge, and change J could devote my time today to reviewing the re\u00ad m~rkable progress of the American Society for Gas\u00ad trointestinal Endoscopy in the areas ofresearch, train\u00ad ing, education, socioeconomics, and practice as they relate to gastroenterology and gastrointestinal endos\u00ad copy. Instead, I feel compelled to address the profound changes that are occurring in the arena of health care. State and federal governments, business, third parties, and even our patients are no longer willing to finance the rapid expansion of health care costs. They are projecting a clear message that, although quality and llCCtlSSibility are desirable, cost escalations that have occurred recently will not be tolerated. We in medicine miist be willing to listen to what is being said and to reapond with positive leadership and cha11~e. Based on this background, I have chosen to discuss the subjects of cost, challenge, and change as they relate to our specialty. I will finish with six recommendations that address the following areas: (1) office endoscopy, (2) endoscopic fees, (3) primary endoscopy, (4) fellow\u00ad s)iip positions, (5) practice management and negotia\u00ad tions, and (6) quality of care. \u00b7Let me first address the issue of costs. It is estimated 0111t total health care costs for 1982 reached the stag\u00ad gering figure of $322 billion, representing 10.53 of the gioss national product.' Over $600,000 is spent for health care every minute. Government, third parties, industry, and patients believe these cost increases are excessive. They will exert tremendous pressures to r8strain increasing health costs. Clearly the issue lieing addressed is cost, not quality. Government has reacted to the rapid increase in health care costs by passing the Tax Equalization and \u00b7 Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) legislation, designed to con\" strain hospital costs. Physicians, however, are begin\u00ad ning to receive their share of attention. Senator Dole \u00b7\"\"\"-\"' &print request.: 30, NO. 6, 1984 Bergein F. Overholt, MD Knoxville, Tennessee has stated that \"this is the year of the physician.\" Furthermore, for hospitalized Medicare patients, Sen\u00ad ator Durenberger has stated: \"Hospital and physician payment& under Medicare must ultimately be lumped together.\" Industry and third parties are also focusing on health care costs and are developing alternative health delivery systems, iacluding the currentiy 1wpular HM Os and PPOs in order to restrain costs. Let me now turn specifically to our specialty. Gas\u00ad troenterology and gastrointestinal endoscopy costs represent only a very small portion of the total health care costs. Our numbers of physicians are few, but because of the technology we use and the costs gen\u00ad erated, we receive an inordinate amount of attention both from within and from without the profession. Almy2 has extrapolated that a gastroenterologist's net hourly income for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is over six times that obtained from the general manage\u00ad ment of the patient's illness. Based on a cost analysis for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (EGO) in 1981, I stated that \"in the hospital where the physician has no overhead or perhaps only the instrument cost to consider, a (physician's) fee of $250 to $300 would appear ... to be excessive.\"3 Schowstack and Schroeder' determined the cost per EGD including the physician's fee to be approximately $41 to $83. Although these authors have revised their estimates, the point to be made is that endoscopic fees are visible, controversial, and being scrutinized as one part of the total costs of health care. Now is the time for gastroen\u00ad terologists to turn the \"scope\" around to view the health care we are providing with an eye toward pro\u00ad viding care for patients in the best possible way at the lowest reasonable cost. Although data covering the costs of gastrointestinal endoscopy are difficult to obtain, certain information is available. The frequency of performance of endo\u00ad scopic procedures deserves comment. first. Data com- 428 piled through 1982 and projected for 1983' are pre\u00ad sented in Table 1. Although of equal importance, the subject of num\u00ad bers of endoscopic procedures and the problem of overutilization is greatly overshadowed by the issue of costs of endoscopy, If one assumes an average physi\u00ad cian charge of $275.00 for EGD and $400.00 for colon\u00ad oscopy, the magnitude of the problem begins to take shape: EGD Colonoscopy Estimated Number Charge = 625,000 x cost $171,875,000.00 205,000 x $400.00 = $ 82,000,000.00 Adding the multitude of additional diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic procedures and their associ\u00ad ated hospital facility usage charges obviously raises \u00b7the total costs of endoscopy to even more signifirRnt amounts. Total costs are viewed by government and third parties as figures of great significance, but it is \u00b7perhaps of greater importance to review the wide variations of endoscopic utilization and charges be\u00ad . tween regions of the country and the remarkable var\u00ad iations within those regions. Data from individual Medicare intermediaries representing geographic areas are outlined in Tables 2 and 3. The tremendous variation between and even within regions in my opinion provides some evidence of ex\u00ad cessive physician fees for endoscopy. I believe that the majority of endoscopists strive to keep prices within reason, but there remains a small percentage of en- . doscopists who charge excessively. Furthermore, I find \u00b7 no logical explanation for the wide range of fees within and between regions of the country even when cost of living variations are considered. My concern is that the large fees being charged by a few reflect financial interests and have very little to do with quality of . care. I believe those physicians who charge excessive endoscopic fees not only tarnish the professional im\u00ad .. age of the majority of reasonable endoscopists but importantly, create an opportunity that can b~ ex~ ploited by regulators and others to essentially threaten the future of the specialty of gastroentero!ogy and \u00b7 gastrointestinal endoscopy.

In gastroenterology, fellowship positions during this period increased from 755 to 772. D~ring the 20-year period from 1963 to 1983 the number of gastroenterologists increased from 564 to 4820, an increase of 854 % which represents the single largest percentage increase in the medical subspecial\u00ad ties. In 1963 this represented one gastroenterologist for approximately 341,000 Americans, whereas in 1983 the ratio has shrunk to one .for approximately 49,000. Increasingly, complaints about \"too many\" are being heard. These new gastroenterologists will vie for the shrinking patient population and will successfully compete with teaching hospitals for patients, with possible detrimental effects on training programs. It would appear that gastroenterology program directors must assess the future impact of the continued expan\u00ad sion of the numbers of gastroenterologists. To shirk this responsibility may well lead to major problems for teaching hospitals. I suggest that gastroenterology program directors consider elimin11ting a full-time fel\u00ad lowship position and offering itin the form of a \"mini\u00ad fellowship\" to practicing gastroenterologists who wish to update their clinical knowledge, thereby satisfying the work load needs, improving \"town and gown\" relationships, and ascertaining a continued referral base of the complex cases that fit so well into the teaching environment. Change and challenge in gastroenterology and gas\u00ad trointestinal endoscopy are occurring. The need for cost reduction is clearly the driving force behind what has, is, and will occur. Gastroenterologists have an opportunity now to participate, to lead, and to make the changes that will occur, or we can passively let government, third parties, and business do it for us. Now is the time for clear thinking and decisive action by our profession with an eye toward preserving the future \u00b7Of our specialty and the quality of care we provide for our patients. What can be done? Let me discuss changes that in my opinion can accomplish stabilization or reductions in costs as they relate to our specialty and yet maintain quality. Office endoscopy. Si1ifLiug 1nore endoscopic proL...:\u00ad dures to the qualified physician whose office meets the facility criteria developed by the A/S/G/E will significantly reduce facility costs. Currently, only 15 to 20% of our membership perform office EGDs and colonoscopies. However, a trend toward more office endoscopy is developing which will place those physi\u00ad cians with this capability in a significantly better competitive position while also improving their prac\u00ad tice efficiency. Concerns about overutilization, performance by un\u00ad trained physicians, and additional overhead have been raised by many. In my opinion reimbursement policies should be developed to limit reimbursement to physi\u00ad cians who have comparable privileges in their com\u00ad munity hospital, similar to policies for reimbursement in ambulatory surgery centers. The potential for mal\u00ad practice claims should discourage untrained and ill\u00ad equipped physicians from performing endoscopy in their offices. Peer review by peer review organizations and third party payers will impact upon the problem of overutilization. Regarding the additional overhead, third parties are .:ecognizing the significaut cost savings potential ur office endoscopy compared to hospital inpatient or outpatient endoscopy. Illinois Blue Cross/Blue Shield, for example, has achieved significant endoscopic cost reductions by reimbursing a \"tray fee\" for office en\u00ad doscopy. I quote from a recent letter from the National Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association referring to office surgery, \"Almost every Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plan is encouraging greater use of the physician's office instead of more costly facility settings for many surgical procedures. Approximately 42 Plans that un\u00ad derwrite medical-surgical care, currently provide some tray or set-up charge in addition to the physician's allOWl,lnce for the Surgical procedure. nil Reimburse\u00ad ment to compensate for the additional costs of provid\u00ad ing office endoscopy will soon be available to most endoscopists. VOLUME 30, NO. 6, 1984 Endoscopic fees. In my op1n1on, endoscopic fees should be stabilized and in some situations reduced. Those endoscopists who charge excessively should reduce their fees. Furthermore, technology in endos\u00ad copy has improved rapidly but certain procedures such as EGD and colunoscopy, have become more or less standard, require less time, and are associated with less risk than when initially introduced. Fees should reflect these factors. Endoscopic fees should be based on a cost analysis modified by the risk, time, training, and malpractice premiums required to perform the procedure. To ig\u00ad nore this approach may result in the exclusion of at least some excellent endoscopic care as we enter into an era of fixed payment reimbursement for health care. Primary endoscopy (PRIUIJE). Endoscopy provides ~ ~etter diagnostic study .. .. 11npared to routine\u00b7~\u00ad ray examination of the stomach. However, the greater cost of an EGD is a significant deterrent to the greater utilization of endoscopy as the primary examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract. To improve the quality and the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic care, endoscopists should consider reducing endoscopic fees for routine examinations of the stomach to ranges competitive with routine barium examinations of the stomach, which is the basis of the primary endoscopy or PRIDGE concept. To this end a new CPT-4 code has been adopted by the AMA that will allow incor\u00b7 poration of this procedure into the practice of gas- trointestinal endoscopy. \u00b7 Fellowship positions in /ilUitroenterology. The rapid increase in the numbers of gastroenterologists may well have long range consequences that will negatively impact on teaching programs in gastroenterology. IJikewisef the increasing numbers of gastroenterolo\u00ad gists entering practice will drive health costs up even further and may well generate an unhealthy environ\u00ad ment among practitioners. It will require strong lead\u00ad ership for program directors to alter the numbers of fellowship positio~s, but in my opinion it will be a necessary move to ensure the highest standards of training and practice in gastroenterology. \u00b7 Practice management/negotiations. Today's gas\u00ad troenterologists must aggressively orient their prac\u00ad tices to serve the needs of their patients, including the needs of the elderly. Innovative thinking and practice styles will be exercised by some and they will be the successful gastroenterologists of tomorrow. Today's gastroenterologists must also become knowledgeable about the costs of providing a service for we are entering an era in which negotiations of costs and charges will become increasingly important. To ne\u00ad gotiate without knowledge of the subject is paramount to losing before starting. Quality. It is essential that gastroenterologists con\u00ad tinue their efforts to ascertain the highest quality of 430 care in medicine and gastroenterology. This requires active involvement in utilization review and peer re\u00ad view whether initiated by the profession or by other parties. No other group outside of the medical prof es\u00b7 sion is more qualified to do so, nor does any other group have the interests of patients as its top priority. In closing, these are times of dramatic change in medicine and gastroenterology. We have an opportu\u00ad nity to participate and to lead, locally and nationally, or we can simply be an observer as others dictate the change. It is our choice. REFERENCES 1.
