The efficacy and safety of the Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine in patients with PNH has not been adequately studied. A retrospective, observational, cohort, non-comparative study was performed to assess the course of COVID-19 as well as the safety and efficacy of the Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) vaccine in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The study included data from 52 patients with PNH aged 18 to 75 years, 38 of whom received background therapy with eculizumab (Elizaria\u00ae) between March 2020 and January 2022. COVID-19 was diagnosed according to the results of PCR testing. The patients were divided into two groups for comparison of the incidence of COVID-19. Group 1 included non-vaccinated patients with PNH, and Group 2 included patients vaccinated prior to the onset of COVID-19. According to vaccination, patients were subdivided into non-vaccinated and vaccinated groups without signs of previous COVID-19 at the beginning of the analyzed period, and patients vaccinated half a year or more after recovery from COVID-19. Testing for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels was carried out in patients with PNH in the year after their COVID-19. Tests for anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD IgG levels were performed on vaccinated patients. In total, 28 (53.8%) of the enrolled patients had COVID-19, including asymptomatic forms in 7 (25%) and mild forms in 16 (57%) patients. A total of 22 (42.3%) patients were fully vaccinated with Gam-COVID-Vac, of which 13 (25%) patients were vaccinated without the signs of previous SARS-CoV-2infection, and 9 (17.3%) patients were vaccinated after COVID-19. The number of patients who had COVID-19 was about two times higher in Group 1 (non-vaccinated; 24) (61.5%), whereas in Group 2 (vaccinated), the number of patients with COVID-19 was only 4 (30.8%). The proportion and number of patients who did not have COVID-19 was higher in the group of vaccinated patients (9; 69.2%) than in the group of non-vaccinated patients (15; 38.5%) (p = 0.054). In patients who had been infected with COVID-19, maximum concentrations of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG were observed 2-3 months after the acute infection phase, followed by a gradual decline by month 9-10. The mean RBD IgG concentration was higher in the group of patients who had been infected by COVID-19 than in the group of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.047). Therapy type, including eculizumab, did not have a significant impact on RBD IgG titers (p > 0.05). Hospitalization was required in five (18%) patients, all of whom had breakthrough hemolysis and severe lung damage on CT scans. After the first dose, adverse events (AEs) were reported in 41% of the patients (body temperature increased in 18%; headache in 13.6%; and pain in joints in 4.5%; colitis exacerbation was observed in 4.5%). After the second dose, no AEs were reported. The performed study suggests the possible efficacy and demonstrates the safety of Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 in patients with PNH who experience immunosuppression due to target therapy.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-09-01", "cleaned_text": "The Features of COVID-19's Course and the Efficacy of the Gam-COVID-Vac Vaccine in Patients with Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria [https://doi.org/10.3390/hematolrep15030052](https://doi.org/10.3390/hematolrep15030052) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-hematolrep-15-00052)]. The development of PNH is genetically caused by somatic mutation in the PIGA (phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class A) gene, resulting in GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinisotol) protein deficiency and the poor binding of CD55 and CD59 to the cell membrane [ [1](#B1-hematolrep-15-00052), [2](#B2-hematolrep-15-00052)]. PNH is an extremely rare disease. According to the international registry of PNH, initiated in 2003, the incidence of PNH is 1-1.5 per 1,000,000 population per year [ [3](#B3-hematolrep-15-00052)]. The prevalence is 1.59 per 100,000 people [ [4](#B4-hematolrep-15-00052)]. In Russia, the current prevalence of PNH is about 5.4 per 1,000,000 people; in Moscow, it is 4.1 per 1,000,000 people. Flow cytometry with individual monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD55, anti-CD59, anti-CD14, or FLAER) is widely used in PNH diagnosis and monitoring, including in patients after infection [ [5](#B5-hematolrep-15-00052)]. [6](#B6-hematolrep-15-00052)]. In 2011, eculizumab was authorized in Russia under the name Soliris. In March 2019, the first biosimilar of eculizumab, Elizaria\u00ae, was authorized, and began to be used [ [7](#B7-hematolrep-15-00052), [8](#B8-hematolrep-15-00052), [9](#B9-hematolrep-15-00052)]. [10](#B10-hematolrep-15-00052)]. Fattizzo B. et al. (2021) described 19 cases of hemolysis of differing severity in patients with PNH, who were predominantly on anti-complement treatment. In 89.4% of patients, mild and moderate-to-severe forms of COVID-19 were reported; two patients required hospitalization in the intensive care unit, and one patient died of severe respiratory failure [ [11](#B11-hematolrep-15-00052)]. [12](#B12-hematolrep-15-00052)]. The literature contains a description of a case of severe hemolysis in an 81-year-old woman after the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, which was then complicated by acute kidney injury [ [13](#B13-hematolrep-15-00052)]. The overview by Fattizzo B. et al. (2021) presented eight cases of hemolysis in patients with PNH after mRNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 (Pfizer, Moderna) [ [11](#B11-hematolrep-15-00052)]. 2. Methods 2.1. Patient Population 2.2. Study Design 2.3. Treatment and Vaccination 2.4. Investigations 2.5. Endpoints 2.6. Statistical Analysis 3. Results [Table 1](#hematolrep-15-00052-t001). [Figure 1](#hematolrep-15-00052-f001)). Due to this, the number and proportion of patients who had no COVID-19 was higher in Group 2, which included vaccinated patients, at 9 (69.2%), than in Group 1 with non-vaccinated patients, which had 15 (38.5%) An efficacy analysis of vaccination with Sputnik V using the Pearson's chi-squared test demonstrated that this number of patients without COVID-19 in Group 2 was very close to being statistically higher than in Group 1 with non-vaccinated patients (p = 0.054) ( [Figure 1](#hematolrep-15-00052-f001)). However, due to the small number of patients, a statistical difference was not determined. In Group 1, nine patients (17.3%) were vaccinated after suffering with COVID-19, in order to prevent the development of a repeated case. [Figure 2](#hematolrep-15-00052-f002)). [Figure 3](#hematolrep-15-00052-f003)). and patients treated concentration of 1161 \u00b1 561 BAU/mL. Patients vaccinated less than 6 months prior had a non-significantly higher concentration of IgG for RBD SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein 1408 \u00b1 694 BAU/mL, while patients vaccinated for more than 6 months had a smaller concentration of 1085 \u00b1 378 BAU/mL. [14](#B14-hematolrep-15-00052)]. After the first dose, AEs were reported in nine (41%) patients, including four (18%) cases of body temperature increases, three (13.6%) cases of headache, one (4.5%) case of pain in joints, and one (4.5%) case of colitis exacerbation. Pain in joints and colitis exacerbation occurred in a PNH patient with multiple comorbidities (rheumatoid arthritis, nonspecific ulcerative colitis, systemic lupus erythematosus). After the second dose, no AEs were reported. Vaccine administration was not accompanied by pharmacodynamic breakthrough hemolysis or hemolysis exacerbation; it did not require hospitalization either. 4. Discussion [15](#B15-hematolrep-15-00052)]. The study demonstrated that the number of patients who had COVID-19 was about two times higher in the group of non-vaccinated patients. Thus, a two-fold reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with PNH vaccinated with Gam-COVID-Vac was found. Hence, vaccination in patients with PNH with the Gam-COVID-Vac may be effective for COVID-19 prevention. This result of vaccine efficacy is slightly less than in the general population [ [16](#B16-hematolrep-15-00052)]. However, it must be taken into account that the majority of patients with PNH received complement blocking therapy, and in some cases had bone marrow failure. [17](#B17-hematolrep-15-00052)]. In the study conducted by Gerber G.F. et al. (2021), hematuria and breakthrough hemolysis were reported in four out of six patients after the administration of both the first and second components of the vaccine [ [12](#B12-hematolrep-15-00052)]. An Italian multicenter study showed that hemolytic events after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 were observed in approximately 6% of patients [ [18](#B18-hematolrep-15-00052)]. In our study, no cases of underlying disease aggravation were reported after vaccination. AEs occurred in 40% patients, but all of them were mild or moderate and did not require additional interventions. These differences may be due to the different vaccines that were used for vaccination. Additional studies are required to clarify the effect of each vaccine on the activation of the complement system. [11](#B11-hematolrep-15-00052)]. On the other hand, patients with PNH are at risk of developing breakthrough hemolysis whilst receiving target therapy, which may be due to the increased activity of the complement system caused by COVID-19 [ [19](#B19-hematolrep-15-00052)]. 5.
