Globally, around 13.38 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses of diverse platforms have been administered. To date, 72.3% of the total population has been injected at least once with a COVID-19 vaccine. As the immunity provided by these vaccines rapidly wanes, their ability to prevent hospitalization and severe disease in individuals with comorbidities has recently been questioned, and increasing evidence has shown that, as with many other vaccines, they do not produce sterilizing immunity, allowing people to suffer frequent re-infections. Additionally, recent investigations have found abnormally high levels of IgG4 in people who were administered two or more injections of the mRNA vaccines. HIV, Malaria, and Pertussis vaccines have also been reported to induce higher-than-normal IgG4 synthesis. Overall, there are three critical factors determining the class switch to IgG4 antibodies: excessive antigen concentration, repeated vaccination, and the type of vaccine used. It has been suggested that an increase in IgG4 levels could have a protecting role by preventing immune over-activation, similar to that occurring during successful allergen-specific immunotherapy by inhibiting IgE-induced effects. However, emerging evidence suggests that the reported increase in IgG4 levels detected after repeated vaccination with the mRNA vaccines may not be a protective mechanism; rather, it constitutes an immune tolerance mechanism to the spike protein that could promote unopposed SARS-CoV2 infection and replication by suppressing natural antiviral responses. Increased IgG4 synthesis due to repeated mRNA vaccination with high antigen concentrations may also cause autoimmune diseases, and promote cancer growth and autoimmune myocarditis in susceptible individuals.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-05-17", "cleaned_text": "Vaccination May Generate Immune Tolerance to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050991](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines11050991) [SARS-CoV-2: Immune Tolerance and Autoimmune Diseases after COVID-19 Vaccination and Its Related people were admitted to hospitals, the Omicron variant was linked to fewer clinical adverse outcomes than the Delta variant. Despite that, the Omicron variant still produced considerable clinical symptoms and mortality [ [2](#B2-vaccines-11-00991), [3](#B3-vaccines-11-00991), [4](#B4-vaccines-11-00991), [5](#B5-vaccines-11-00991), [6](#B6-vaccines-11-00991)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-11-00991)], the data in the United Kingdom contradict the CDC's findings. Specifically, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the United Kingdom has reported that from April to mid-November 2021, deaths in unvaccinated people were higher in comparison with vaccinated people who had received a second vaccine dose. However, from the end of November 2021 to December 2022, this situation reverted: deaths were higher in vaccinated people who received a third vaccine dose compared with the unvaccinated [ [8](#B8-vaccines-11-00991)]. Moreover, a recent work investigated a probable relationship between COVID-19 vaccination uptake in Europe in 2021 and monthly excess all-cause mortality in 2022; that is, mortality was higher than before the pandemic. All-cause mortality during the first 9 months of 2022 increased more in countries with higher 2021 vaccination uptake, according to analyses of 31 countries estimated by population size; a one percentage point increase in 2021 vaccination uptake was associated with a monthly mortality increase in 2022 of 0.105% (95% CI, 0.075-0.134). The relationship remained strong after adjusting for alternative factors [ [9](#B9-vaccines-11-00991)]. [10](#B10-vaccines-11-00991), [11](#B11-vaccines-11-00991), [12](#B12-vaccines-11-00991), [13](#B13-vaccines-11-00991)]. The high rate of breakthrough infections brought on by the Omicron variant suggests that the sterilizing protection offered by the existing immunization schedules is minimal [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00991)]. There are several evasion strategies that SARS-CoV-2 uses to elude immunological monitoring and attack, including the impairment of interferon synthesis [ [15](#B15-vaccines-11-00991), [16](#B16-vaccines-11-00991), [17](#B17-vaccines-11-00991), [18](#B18-vaccines-11-00991), [19](#B19-vaccines-11-00991), [20](#B20-vaccines-11-00991)], of humoral attack by constructing nanotubes [ [27](#B27-vaccines-11-00991)]. [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00991), [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00991)], and it has also been documented that mRNA vaccines trigger their synthesis [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991), [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00991)]. It is, therefore, important to analyze this issue in depth. In this paper, we provide the scientific rationale suggesting that repeated vaccination with mRNA vaccines could generate an immune tolerance mechanism, thereby favoring unopposed SARS-CoV-2 replication. The long-term consequence of this tolerance could be the establishment of a permissive state of the host leading to chronic infection and other unintended consequences induced by mRNA vaccination in susceptible individuals. 2. Characteristics of the Unusual IgG4 Antibody [32](#B32-vaccines-11-00991), [33](#B33-vaccines-11-00991), [34](#B34-vaccines-11-00991)]. Immunoglobulin subclasses differ in their basic physiologic regulation, localization throughout the organism, and engagement with receptors on immune system effector cells [ [35](#B35-vaccines-11-00991)]. IgG4, the less prevalent subclass, is found in serum at mean values of 0.35-0.51 mg/mL [ [36](#B36-vaccines-11-00991)], while the levels of IgG1, the most prevalent subclass, fluctuate between 5 and 12 mg/mL [ [37](#B37-vaccines-11-00991)]. Due to its unusual biological characteristics and deficiency of effector functions, such as the ability to destroy infected cells through the activation of the complement system or using antibodies, IgG4 has been referred to as an unusual antibody by not adhering to the accepted theory of antibody structure and function [ [38](#B38-vaccines-11-00991), [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00991)]. [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00991)]. The heavy chains can dissociate and then recombine arbitrarily due to the enhanced propensity of the natural IgG4 joint disulfide bonds to reduction, resulting in a heterogeneous group of IgG4 molecules with random heavy-chain Pathogenic Antibody? [43](#B43-vaccines-11-00991), [44](#B44-vaccines-11-00991)]. This implies that there will only be a minimal immune response when IgG4 interacts with molecules [ [45](#B45-vaccines-11-00991)]. An IgG4 response can be either pathogenic or protective, depending on the situation. For instance, IgG4 is frequently referred to as a safeguarding blocking antibody because it can suppress or halt inflammation by competing with inflammatory IgE for antigen binding in the case of allergies and infections with helminth and filarial parasites. In contrast, IgG4 can lead to serious illness in several autoimmune disorders [ [46](#B46-vaccines-11-00991)] as well as cancer [ [47](#B47-vaccines-11-00991), [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00991)]. Its bi-functionality will be thoroughly examined in the next subsections. 2.1.1. Protective Role of IgG4 in Allergy Immunotherapy [40](#B40-vaccines-11-00991)]. High concentrations of antigen-specific IgG4 are linked to satisfactory results in allergen-specific inhibiting immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated effects according to published studies [ [49](#B49-vaccines-11-00991), [50](#B50-vaccines-11-00991)]. In various aspects, developing a tolerance to allergens is an essential step in the development of a strong immune system. Hence, to develop prolonged desensitization against allergens, pathways involving modified allergen-specific memory T- and B-cell responses that lead to immunological tolerance are utilized [ [51](#B51-vaccines-11-00991), and Its autoantibodies have been found in the serum of individuals with IgG4-RD, according to earlier reports [ [55](#B55-vaccines-11-00991), [56](#B56-vaccines-11-00991), [57](#B57-vaccines-11-00991), [58](#B58-vaccines-11-00991), [59](#B59-vaccines-11-00991)]. Furthermore, it is well-known that steroid therapy is typically quite successful in treating IgG4-RD patients. These characteristics suggest that the illness is autoimmune in origin. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, produced remarkable clinical responses in IgG4-RD patients in recent investigations, accompanied by a sizable B cell and plasmablast decrease [ [60](#B60-vaccines-11-00991)]. [61](#B61-vaccines-11-00991)]. Because of its particular biological traits, such as the capacity to interchange Fab arms [ [45](#B45-vaccines-11-00991)], the incapacity to bind complement, and the weak affinity for Fc receptors [ [62](#B62-vaccines-11-00991)], IgG4 is regarded as an anti-inflammatory immunoglobulin. IgG4 antibodies do, however, function as tissue-damaging autoantibodies in some disorders, as seen in myasthenia [ [77](#B77-vaccines-11-00991)]\". It also plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of at least 13 autoimmune disorders. It has been shown that laboratory animals passively infused with human total IgG or IgG4 develop signs in 5 of these 13 disorders, proving the pathogenicity of this antibody. IgG4-induced autoimmunity is suggested by the finding that the majority of antigen-specific autoantibodies are of the IgG4 class and that their concentrations correlate with the seriousness of the sickness for the eight remaining disorders [ [46](#B46-vaccines-11-00991)]. For example, Myasthenia gravis (MG), which is characterized by the production of antibodies that attach to muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), is distinguished by sporadic muscular stiffness with significant involvement of the axial and bulbar muscles. At a certain stage during the illness, a significant portion of patients requires breathing support [ [78](#B78-vaccines-11-00991), [79](#B79-vaccines-11-00991)]. [80](#B80-vaccines-11-00991), [81](#B81-vaccines-11-00991), [82](#B82-vaccines-11-00991)]. High-purity IgG4 from MuSK MG patients was able to attach to neuromuscular connections in mouse muscle, but not IgG1-3 from the same patients or control IgG4. Injection with this antibody caused a myasthenic phenotype in immune-compromised animals [ [83](#B83-vaccines-11-00991), Role in Cancer [87](#B87-vaccines-11-00991), [88](#B88-vaccines-11-00991)]. ICB has demonstrated therapeutic effectiveness in a wide range of cancer types, including advanced-stage cancer patients [ [89](#B89-vaccines-11-00991), [90](#B90-vaccines-11-00991), [91](#B91-vaccines-11-00991)]. Regrettably, only 15-30% of cancer patients who have received treatment benefit from ICB's therapeutic efficacy [ [92](#B92-vaccines-11-00991)]. Most crucially, new reports show that certain cancer patients receiving anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody treatment have rapid disease progression (also known as hyper progressive disease (HPD) instead of cancer remission [ [93](#B93-vaccines-11-00991), [94](#B94-vaccines-11-00991), [95](#B95-vaccines-11-00991)]. Notably, the PD-1 antibody belongs to the IgG4 family. Furthermore, cancers, such as malignant melanoma [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00991)], extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [ [96](#B96-vaccines-11-00991)], and pancreatic [97](#B97-vaccines-11-00991)], linked to plasma B-cell infiltrates that are IgG4-positive. IgG4s contribution to cancer is poorly understood, but a groundbreaking study has added important new knowledge. Karagiannis et al. [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00991)] studied malignant melanoma and found that IL-4 and IL-10 expression was elevated and that tumor-specific IgG4 was generated locally in the tumor tissues. It is common to think of IL-10 as an anti-inflammatory cytokine; however, this is only true in low quantities, as at larger concentrations, it shows pro-inflammatory effects [ [98](#B98-vaccines-11-00991), [99](#B99-vaccines-11-00991), [100](#B100-vaccines-11-00991)]. [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00991)] contrast IgG1, cancer-specific IgG4 failed to activate two immunological processes that employ antibodies to identify and destroy cancer cells. Moreover, the IgG1 antibody was able to suppress cancer progression in an in vivo model, while IgG4 failed to do so. IgG4 antibodies cannot directly attack tumor cells and can interfere with the process of tumor cell death mediated by IgG1 antibodies. The inhibition of IgG1 binding and activation by Fc RI is the mechanism behind this obstructing activity. Such findings point to a previously un-researched feature of tumor-induced immune escape: IgG4 synthesis induced by tumors limits effector immune cell activities against tumors [ [48](#B48-vaccines-11-00991)]. Another work [ [101](#B101-vaccines-11-00991)] came to the same conclusion; that is, the IgG4 antibody is important and necessary for cancer immune evasion. In a cohort of individuals with esophageal cancer, B cells producing high IgG4 concentrations were markedly raised in malignant cells and also high in serum samples from patients. More IgG4 seems to be linked to more aggressive cancer growth, and both were strongly associated with higher cancer malignancy and poor prognosis. It was discovered that IgG4 can contend with IgG1 (as shown in [Figure 3](#vaccines-11-00991-f003)) in binding to Fc receptors present in some immune cells in vitro. This competition results in the inhibition of typical immune responses against cancer cells, such as cell and complement cytotoxicity and cell phagocytosis, which are mediated by IgG1 antibodies. [101](#B101-vaccines-11-00991)]. [102](#B102-vaccines-11-00991)]. Intriguingly, the anti-PD-1 antibodies are class IgG4, raising the concern that this therapy is a double-edged sword. For instance, patients using immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination have been linked to occurrences of acute myocarditis [ [103](#B103-vaccines-11-00991), [104](#B104-vaccines-11-00991), [105](#B105-vaccines-11-00991), [106](#B106-vaccines-11-00991)], sometimes with lethal consequences [ [107](#B107-vaccines-11-00991)]. 3. The Role of IgG4 Antibodies Induced by Different Vaccines 3.1. Excessive Antigen Concentration in Vaccines [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00991)]. [108](#B108-vaccines-11-00991)]. A large amount (dose concentration) or repeated immunization with the same antigen (vaccine) tends to induce specific T cell tolerance (peripheral CD4) and subsequently inhibit immune responses [ [108](#B108-vaccines-11-00991), [109](#B109-vaccines-11-00991)]. However, a high antigen dose in primary immunization has been recommended for lytic infections, which is required for both humoral and cellular immunity cooperation, while a low antigen dose is recommended for boosting [ [110](#B110-vaccines-11-00991), [111](#B111-vaccines-11-00991)]. A dose escalation technique is typically employed in clinical phase I vaccine investigations to find the dose that produces the best response. While this makes sense for diseases where there is no known immunological indicator of protection (thus, a robust response is probably superior to no response), the maximum dose that was tolerated and resulted in a positive response has often been adopted for following phase II/III investigations. Yet, significant arguments against this approach are supported by several major findings [ [108](#B108-vaccines-11-00991)]: [108](#B108-vaccines-11-00991)]. [108](#B108-vaccines-11-00991)] provided proof of cases where lower vaccine antigen doses resulted in more positive responses from T cells, both for quality as judged by several effector capabilities and preventive efficiency in both animal and human experiments, and they presented arguments for the significance of reducing antigen dose for optimum protection in some models. They also encouraged experts in T-cell vaccination, in particular, to remember that sometimes, less certainly is more. In conclusion, is there a link between antigen dose concentration, repeated exposure, and the induction of IgG4 production? Or is the elevated IgG4 concentration associated with COVID-19 vaccination due to genetic predisposition? Because approximately half of the vaccinees showed a substantial increase in IgG4 concentration after the second mRNA inoculation [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)], it is evident that such an increase is not caused by a genetic predisposition. Moreover, Moderna and Pfizer used the same antigen dose for their primary and booster vaccinations, which contradicts the vaccinology paradigm showing that a low antigen dose is recommended for boosting [ [110](#B110-vaccines-11-00991), [111](#B111-vaccines-11-00991)]. 3.2. Repeated Vaccination 3.2.1. Repeated Inoculation with COVID-19 Vaccines [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. Of all IgG antibodies generated against the spike protein, the IgG4 increased the most, steadily from 0.04% immediately after the second vaccination to 19.27% late after the third one. [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. To determine if the increase in IgG4 antibody concentration was exclusive to the homologous mRNA vaccination schedule utilized, researchers studied sera from an independent group that evaluated the immune system's capacity to react to immunization schedules that are similar and different, with the Pfizer and the adenoviral vector-based vaccine from AstraZeneca. Anti-spike IgG4 antibodies were again detected in 50% of the sera from the BNT-BNT group five to six months after the second vaccination but in only one of the 51 serum samples from the other two vaccine groups. Significantly, following the third booster immunization, a significant rise in IgG4 antibody levels was detected in virtually all vaccine recipients [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. [112](#B112-vaccines-11-00991)]. Repeated antigen stimulation reportedly caused CD8+ T cells to become exhausted. These boosters also significantly diminished CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and enhanced programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3) production in these T cells [ [112](#B112-vaccines-11-00991)]. Prolonged vaccination decreased the normal development of the germinal center and hindered the generation of memory B cells specific for RBD. This research additionally revealed that prolonged RBD vaccine booster immunization increased the concentration of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 as well as the proportion of CD25+Foxp3+CD4+ Treg cells. The conventional SARS-CoV-2 vaccine's ability to provide immunological protection may be significantly impacted by over-vaccination. If this happens, either newly diagnosed COVID-19 cases or people who have already contracted the virus again may have a more severe case of the illness. This concept was proposed after seeing tolerance of both the humoral and cellular immune responses to prolonged booster immunization doses [ [112](#B112-vaccines-11-00991)]. 3.2.2. Repeated Inoculation with HIV Vaccines [113](#B113-vaccines-11-00991)]. Since the VAX003 vaccine increased levels of IgG4, which have historically been linked to reduced immunological efficiency, researchers wanted to know if the IgG4 production was merely triggered in connection with a disordered functional response or if it made a significant contribution to the improperly organized response. When IgG4 antibodies were eliminated from 16 similar samples from both trials, a significant increase in ADCP activity and a tendency toward greater ADCC for the VAX003 samples in comparison to bulk IgG was observed. These findings show that IgG4 antibodies may directly decrease antibody Fc-effector function rather than only being linked to the generation of an ad hoc reaction. Compared to VAX003, which produced mono-functional antibodies with significant amounts of IgG4 following seven protein vaccinations, RV144 produced highly functional IgG3 antibodies [ [113](#B113-vaccines-11-00991)]. Therefore, several vaccinations and vaccine protocols may produce persistent antibody responses, but these IgG4 antibodies may not be as effective as the IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses. As a result, the IgG subclass change from fully efficient antibodies (IgG3) to IgG4 may constitute an important obstacle to the HIV vaccine's success [ [114](#B114-vaccines-11-00991)]. [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. Additionally, vaccine-induced IgG3 antibodies blocked these processes [ [113](#B113-vaccines-11-00991)]. Similarly, in the HIV study, the removal of IgG4 antibodies from serum led to significant elevations in Fc-mediated effector activities, confirming a non-protective role for IgG4 antibodies. The unusually high production of IgG4 in the VAX003 group could be due to the repeated injection of seven vaccine doses containing a high antigen concentration in the lack of appropriate adjuvant stimulation, which may have culminated in disproportionate B cell receptor activation [ [113](#B113-vaccines-11-00991)]. [113](#B113-vaccines-11-00991)]. This supports the notion that an increase in IgG4 subclasses could lead to extended viral persistence in case of infection, considering that Fc-mediated effector action is essential for viral elimination [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. 3.2.3. Repeated Inoculation with the MALARIA Vaccine [115](#B115-vaccines-11-00991)]. Since it is believed that the antibody isotype evoked by P. falciparum antigens is essential, the prophylactic effect of IgG has been attributed to the neutralizing and was consistent over the first year of life before rising in the following year. [115](#B115-vaccines-11-00991)]. [115](#B115-vaccines-11-00991)]. It is interesting to note that a separate study also found a link between high IgG4 levels and a higher risk of infection and malaria exacerbations [ [121](#B121-vaccines-11-00991)]. This implies that IgG4 blocks the cytotoxicity of IgG2-dependent cells caused by monocytes or other effector cells. IgG4 levels and the likelihood of malaria infection were both associated with the season of malaria transmission. The fact that IgG4 concentrations significantly increased throughout the transmission season and that the rise was greater in younger individuals than in older individuals also supports an IgG4 blocking function [ [121](#B121-vaccines-11-00991)]. Moreover, IgG4 has been demonstrated to prevent the opsonization of infected erythrocytes by IgG1 and IgG3 in vitro [ [122](#B122-vaccines-11-00991)]. 3.3. The Type of Vaccine Used [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. These results provide support to the proposal that IgG4 class switching is not a common result of repeated antigen exposure from immunizations against other viruses or illnesses [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. Even though natural infection with the measles virus can generate specific IgG4 antibodies [ [123](#B123-vaccines-11-00991)], even persistent viral infections such as the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) do not produce a high amount of IgG4 antibodies [ [124](#B124-vaccines-11-00991)]. [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00991)]. It is interesting to note that two mRNA vaccines, together with one AZD1222 (AstraZeneca) inoculation with an mRNA booster, and especially the mRNA-1273 vaccine, caused prolonged anti-S1 IgG4 responses in uninfected subjects. However, researchers were unable to detect this rise after two doses of the AZD1222 vaccine in uninfected individuals up to day 270, showing that only mRNA vaccines induced detectable and prolonged IgG4 responses until day 270. Importantly, in patients who had a previous COVID-19 infection (before vaccination), IgG4 did not rise, even after mRNA injections, implying that those with higher IgG4 levels are uninfected people who were immunized with mRNA vaccines before having their COVID-19 infection [ [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00991)]. [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00991)] found that the adenoviral vector-based vaccine from AstraZeneca did not elicit such an increase in IgG4 levels. Moreover, other studies have shown that acellular (aP) but not whole Pertussis (wP) vaccines induced IgG4 antibody production, which was also related to impaired immunity. It was demonstrated that children injected with wP vaccines had greater total and IgG1+ plasma cell responses than those injected with an aP vaccine [ [125](#B125-vaccines-11-00991)]. According to results presented at the World Association for Infectious Diseases and Immune Disorders (WAidid) Congress [ [126](#B126-vaccines-11-00991)], children who had received an aP vaccine at their primary immunization had significantly higher IgG4 levels than children who had received a wP vaccine. Because IgG4 antibodies are incapable of activating the complement system and, as a result, triggering antibody-dependent phagocytosis [ [39](#B39-vaccines-11-00991)], it is critical for the effectiveness of a pertussis vaccine to generate a large antibodies arsenal, with IgG1 antibodies being more effective than IgG4 antibodies [ [126](#B126-vaccines-11-00991)]. 4. Discussion [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. The authors commented that \"independent of the underlying mechanism, the induction of antiviral IgG4 antibodies is a phenomenon infrequently described and raises important questions about its functional consequences\" [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. IgG4 antibodies are bi-functional: they can be protective but can also be directly pathogenic [ [127](#B127-vaccines-11-00991)]. There has been a lot of research on IgG4 in chronic allergen exposure models, where natural immunological tolerance is induced by giving an allergen in increasing doses [ [128](#B128-vaccines-11-00991)]. The increase in IgG4 levels after the third immunization with the Pfizer vaccine could reflect a tolerance mechanism that could prevent immune over-reactivity (cytokine storm) and progression to a critical stage [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. However, this exacerbated immune reaction does not occur in young and healthy people, and it has been documented only in older patients with genetic susceptibility and those with comorbidities [ [129](#B129-vaccines-11-00991)]. [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. Allergen tolerance is an immune system adaptation characterized by a particular non-inflammatory response to an allergen that, under other conditions, would probably result in cell-mediated or humoral immunity, which would cause tissue inflammation and/or IgE synthesis [ [128](#B128-vaccines-11-00991)]. In other words, the immune system \"learns\" to tolerate a foreign, although innocuous, antigen. However, a very different situation occurs when a virus invades our body. In this scenario, vaccine-induced tolerance can potentially have several negative, unintended consequences because tolerance to the spike protein could inhibit the immune system from detecting and attacking the pathogen ( [Figure 4](#vaccines-11-00991-f004)); thus, potentially exacerbating SARS-CoV2 pathology in susceptible individuals who suffer re-infection of COVID-19 in the setting of vaccine-induced immune suppression. For example, it was demonstrated that patients with severe COVID-19 who passed away had higher IgG4 levels than those who recovered [ [28](#B28-vaccines-11-00991)]. More precisely, the death rate increased noticeably at 30 days when serum IgG4 concentrations were above 700 mg/dL, and the ratio of IgG4 to IgG1 was above 0.05 [ [29](#B29-vaccines-11-00991)]. Moreover, IgG4 levels were correlated with IL-6 levels [ findings may Omicron infections caused fewer severe effects [ [136](#B136-vaccines-11-00991), [137](#B137-vaccines-11-00991)]. However, without an adequate protection level, even the new Omicron sub-variants (considered as mild) could cause severe multi-organ damage and death in immuno-compromised individuals and those with comorbidities. [138](#B138-vaccines-11-00991)]. [138](#B138-vaccines-11-00991)]. This study casts some doubt on the notion that widespread immunization will produce herd immunity and stop COVID-19 outbreaks. This may have been true for the SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus, but in the outbreak that is the subject of the cited study, 96.2% of those who were exposed received full vaccinations [ [139](#B139-vaccines-11-00991)]. Similarly, Brosh-Nissimov et al. reported that among 17 Israeli hospitals, 34/152 (22%) fully immunized patients passed away from COVID-19. Noticeably, these individuals had a high prevalence of co-morbid disorders, such as congestive heart failure, chronic renal insufficiency, high blood pressure, diabetes, and lung disorders, that made them more vulnerable to developing severe COVID-19 [ [140](#B140-vaccines-11-00991)]. [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)] reported that it takes months for the IgG4 class switch to develop. Could this increase in IgG4 levels explain the reduced efficacy of mRNA vaccines detected after 6 months [ [141](#B141-vaccines-11-00991)]? Based on findings from the HIV trial [ [113](#B113-vaccines-11-00991)], where decreased vaccine efficacy was linked to IgG4 production, we conclude that repeated mRNA vaccination is also correlated with reduced efficacy in protecting people from re-infection due to an increase in IgG4 levels. [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00991)]. This is in contrast with findings from another study showing that the highest IgG4 levels were found in those individuals who developed a breakthrough infection after receiving three doses of mRNA vaccination, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 infections can also induce IgG4 production [ [30](#B30-vaccines-11-00991)]. We suggest more research is needed for a definitive conclusion about these different results. [113](#B113-vaccines-11-00991)] and malaria trials [ [115](#B115-vaccines-11-00991)], and studies with the Pertussis vaccine informed us that repeated vaccination was linked to reduced protection from infection, and this poor response was directly related to a higher IgG4 production. Moreover, it was suggested that this class switch might contribute to breakthrough infections due to impaired fc-mediated antiviral responses [ [113](#B113-vaccines-11-00991)]. All in all, reviewed data indicate that IgG4 production induced by repeated vaccination does not in any way constitute a protective mechanism. There are also warning signs in recent literature that indicate the cellular immune response induced by the typical vaccination course may be severely compromised by repeated administration of the same booster shot or infection following vaccination, which, in combination with impaired antibody immune responses, may cause recipients' symptoms to worsen or their disease to last longer. Excessive vaccination is likely to create an immunosuppressive microenvironment that is crucial for promoting immunological tolerance. These findings show that repeated SARS-CoV-2 booster immunization in dense populations should be approached with caution [ [112](#B112-vaccines-11-00991)]. [142](#B142-vaccines-11-00991), [143](#B143-vaccines-11-00991)], possibly causing immune suppression and leaving the individual in a vulnerable situation against any other pathogen. In addition, this immune suppression could allow the re-activation of latent viral, bacterial, or fungal infections and might also allow the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells [ [142](#B142-vaccines-11-00991), [143](#B143-vaccines-11-00991), [144](#B144-vaccines-11-00991)]) could explain a plethora of autoimmune conditions, such as cancers, re-infections, and deaths temporally associated with both. It is conceivable that the excess deaths reported in several highly COVID-19-vaccinated countries may be explained, in part, by this combined immunosuppressive effect. [146](#B146-vaccines-11-00991)]. According to the self-organized criticality theory, when the immune system of the host is continually overstimulated by antigen exposure at concentrations higher than the immune system's self-organized criticality can tolerate, systemic autoimmunity inevitably occurs [ [147](#B147-vaccines-11-00991)]. [31](#B31-vaccines-11-00991)]. Thus, it is probable that the spike protein produced in response to mRNA vaccination is too high and lasts too long in the body. That could overwhelm the capacity of the immune system, leading to autoimmunity [ [146](#B146-vaccines-11-00991), [147](#B147-vaccines-11-00991)]. Indeed, several investigations have found that COVID-19 immunization is associated with the development of autoimmune responses immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination have been linked to occurrences of acute myocarditis [ [103](#B103-vaccines-11-00991), [104](#B104-vaccines-11-00991), [105](#B105-vaccines-11-00991), [106](#B106-vaccines-11-00991), [107](#B107-vaccines-11-00991)], sometimes with [ [102](#B102-vaccines-11-00991)]. As anti-PD-1 antibodies are class IgG4, and these antibodies are also induced by repeated vaccination, it is plausible to suggest that excessive vaccination could be associated with the occurrence of an increased number of myocarditis cases and sudden cardiac deaths. [133](#B133-vaccines-11-00991), [134](#B134-vaccines-11-00991), [135](#B135-vaccines-11-00991), [136](#B136-vaccines-11-00991), [137](#B137-vaccines-11-00991)], and against re-infection [ [14](#B14-vaccines-11-00991), [138](#B138-vaccines-11-00991)], clinicians should be aware of the possible detrimental effects on the immune system by administering boosters.
