As some employment opportuni - ties dis appear and income disparities grow in the face of modern automation and globalization\u2014 and, as wages, particularly for low- skilled workers, stagnate\u2014 fear about decent jobs is understandable, and the optimism needed for investing in one's future is undermined. The discussion that follows focuses on the last few de cades. It does not try to predict the future, although some trends are evident. Indeed, in late 2017 and early 2018, GDP growth in the world economy accelerated, due mainly to employment growth. Whether this acceleration will be lasting and bring with it the long awaited acceleration of labor productivity growth remains to be seen. However, as yet there are no significant signs that growth is becoming more inclusive, particularly in advanced economies. The in - creasing high incomes at the very top of the distribution and the stagnation in median incomes in many countries have become major po liti cal prob lems. This all could place a serious brake on deriving the full potential benefits of dramatic new technologies. The loss of societal cohesion and the erosion of trust in demo cratic institutions have led to significant hurdles for the kind of policymaking that could allow the benefits of frontier technologies to be reaped more rapidly and more equitably. It is impor tant to distinguish between income distribution across coun - tries and income distribution within countries. Starting in the 1990s, a pro cess of convergence began, with the per capita income of developing countries in the aggregate beginning to grow faster than those of advanced countries. While a large part of this convergence pro cess was due to China, viii Foreword with its huge weight skewing the developing country average, it has not been just a \"China phenomenon\" but a more general trend, making the global income distribution less unequal. Nevertheless, there remain numerous countries not yet experiencing the narrowing of inter- country differentials, so this continues to be an international issue. At the same time, income distributions within major economies became more unequal. The po liti cal debate inside countries naturally deals primarily with this fact. This foreword provides a brief outline of these issues and summarizes the dynamics affecting con temporary growth and distribution patterns. It is followed by an Introduction, \"Technology, Productivity and Distribu - tion: Framework for an Informed Dialogue,\" that sets out a framework as well as a discussion of observed market per for mance, analyses, and policy considerations regarding the identified constituent ele ments affecting the results. The chapters beyond report on the research to document and ana - lyze the trends and their implications in more detail. Technology and Competition as Determinants: New technologies have long been understood\u2014 and empirically observed\u2014to be the funda - mental driver of increased productivity and greater output from their ap - plication. Progressive dissemination of such advances under a competitive need to \"keep up,\" to thrive, or even to survive, enhances cumulative output, aggregate productivity, growth, and living standards. Greater worker pro - ductivity, supply and demand for skills, and the ensuing growth all drive compensation, and with some public policy adjustment help where necessary, as frequently was the case in the past, it led, also, to wide sharing of the income gains. Adjustment Policy: To facilitate the transition for those displaced by innovation\u2014if they are not re- employed in a timely manner, often in higher paying jobs\u2014 some level of publicly provided adjustment and re - training support, social ser vices, pensions, and similar public policies have smoothed the way toward sharing the gains. The absolute levels of such support are quite di ff er ent by country, depending on the nation's state of development and industrialization as well as po liti cal pro cesses. It is prob - able that displaced workers will be calling upon these considerations in significant numbers and with increased frequency in the con temporary world of technological change. Technology Pro cess, Economic Growth, and Income Distribution: Both the growth of output and the distribution of the value created vary Foreword ix across sectors and cycles of the economy. The economic sequence and our use of the terminology of the technological pro cess starts with basic scien - tific research, then is followed by applied R&D, to produce new technolo - gies. Subsequently, their productive application in the adoption of innova - tion requires investment that disseminates the new capacities. The sum of the uses aggregates to overall productivity of an economy. The dynamics produce economic output/growth and a pre- fiscal and social ser vice distri - bution of the gains, evolving over each technology's life cycle. A new tech - nology is typically launched in the market in which it was developed, de - ployed by early adopters at relatively high price levels, and later disseminated for more widespread adoption, larger scale, and lower cost production, in - cluding manufacturers/producers seeking out lower cost production loca - tions, either at home or abroad. Reasonable incomes, distribution that funded demand, and the appeal of new goods and ser vices have generally maintained demand and social support for the pro cess despite there being winners and losers from the changes brought by new technologies\u2014and, for that matter, by international rationalization and trade. Growth and Distribution Per for mance: Mea sured per for mance of productivity, growth, and income distribution have changed materially over recent de cades, generating less economic gain than pos si ble and greater disparities of income within countries; and even more significant disparities of wealth. The magnitudes and trends are socially damaging, divisive, and destabilizing. These two developments, affecting both in - come distribution and output, affect all categories of the population\u2014 and output foregone reduces the resources with which to address income issues as well. This should command the attention of all segments of the citizenry in virtually all countries. Common Principal Causes: The two broad per for mance and policy issues addressed here\u2014 economic advance/output and socio- political sat - isfaction and stability from the distribution of its benefits\u2014 have impor - tant determinants in common; and several of the same policy provisions would enhance output and produce less extreme disparities than those seen over recent periods. A challenge lies in the fact that the correctives must come from the societal institutions and actors that gave rise to the current conditions. But it is worth noting that it does not take long for other wise foregone productivity and output, if captured and compounded, to benefit all, despite some costs being made to be borne by the \"winners\" x Foreword to offset the impacts on the \"losers\" and to remedy the displacement of those who are faultless and unable to recoup the loss. There are some characteristics of the sequence from R&D, to economic output, and income distribution that are noteworthy for the discussion. Regarding R&D, the government's direct role in expenditure and se - lection has declined (from 1.2 percent of GDP in the early 1980s to 0.6 percent in 2015 in the United States), as has basic scientific research. Private sector R&D has increased. Its objectives and greater product focus involve fewer development ramifications and more legal defense of intellectual property rights and the market power those rights support. R&D se lection influences are shifting, and the results are less productive. Tax incentives support this activity. Being responsible for setting defense and space sector demand and the development of some health technologies\u2014as well as procurement for defense, space, and some social services\u2014 means that governments directly influence significant R&D se lection and technology deployment pro cesses. Related to economic output, productive new technology is very much in evidence, but overall average productivity growth has fallen by half in advanced economies, from just over 2 percent annually from 1990 to 2004 to approximately 1 percent from 2004 to 2016. Within this, the most pro - ductive firms have improved their productivity growth at around 3 percent a year from 2001 through 2013 compared to around 0.5 percent for all other firms. This pattern of limited dispersion of innovations across firms reflects low investment and, hence, low aggregate productivity improve - ment, since investment is a principal driver and vehicle of dissemination. There are some separate questions about investment, including: timing; de- motivation caused by excessive savings/low return/low interest rate en - vironments; and impediments or risks affecting the willingness of the de - cision makers to invest in some higher yielding locations. But it remains the case that markets with low levels of competitive forces do little to drive investment and dissemination of innovation, dynamics that directly ad - versely affect the rate of growth. It is instructive to note that the under lying investment decline in the deployment of productivity enhancing technologies predates the recent financial crisis and continues today. Also, significantly increased market concentration, super profits for the leading firms, and reduced market entry coincide with the period of deteriorating productivity per for mance and these would appear to diminish competitive motivation to develop and Foreword xi deploy new technologies and innovation. It is also clear that reduced com - petition and dominance by a few firms are reinforced by intellectual property protection (or by a greater exploitation of these rights).1 Additionally, some new digital technology- based ser vices have \"winner- takes- most\" quasi- natural mono poly characteristics. Wide dissemination of a ser vice or product innovation to end users, at user pricing that reflects market power, does less to advance desired per for mance. It is diffusion of the technology among competitive ser vice providers or goods manufac - turers that accomplishes wider access to the technology that leads to mea - sured productivity improvement and more widely- distributed gains. National governments are effectively less able to oversee global compa - nies in the wider public interest with regulatory alternatives to competition. International trade now, increasingly, moves between national entities of the same com pany, enhancing corporate market power. It is inter- company transfers that increase dissemination and competition; and such transfers now are lagging.2 Fi nally, nationalistically driven international agreements tend to pro - tect the signatory countries' dominant companies rather than implement joint governance, thereby further reinforcing corporate power. The causes of lower economic per for mance also contribute to distribution disparities, and vice versa. Further, economic power accentuates the po liti cal influence responsible for the policies that impact economic growth, in - come distribution, as well as the social advantages, such as education, that perpetuate economic disparities. There are significant linkages. First, as noted, the market power of dominant firms retards investment by others, hence, delaying dissemination of technological advances and their impacts on productivity and growth. The leading firms capture a growing share of the productivity gains in national income, favoring capi - tal relative to labor; and the share to capital accrues to wealth, which is held disproportionately by a very small percentage of the population. This economic disparity is perpetuated by the socio- political advantages of wealth\u2014 which include a good education from earliest ages and the ability to benefit more from some public ser vices. Education is linked, of course, to premium compensation paid to the more skilled, particularly by the leading firms. There is a growing wage gap, generally between sectors but even between leading and other firms in the same sector, which has widened xii Foreword by 12 percent in the United States between 2001 and 2012. This polariza - tion of incomes reduces demand and output by virtue of lower propensi - ties on the part of higher income groups to spend as large a portion of their incomes, thereby generating less aggregate demand compared with more equally distributed purchasing power. A growing body of economic research suggests this wage differential is a major driver of growing dis - parities overall. Automation drives more reduction of middle- income jobs by replacing, particularly, repetitive tasks often characteristic of such jobs. This is rein - forced by globalization and low cost labor availability at other locations. Together these forces further increase income disparities, at least in the outsourcing economies, and likely within the supplying economies, even while the differential between the two groups of countries is reduced. At the same time, re distribution following initial market results, effected through transfer payments and public ser vices, defines ultimate disposable incomes and living standards. In the period studied, however, reduced tax rates on income and wealth\u2014 personal and corporate\u2014 have reduced pub - lic resources available for re distribution to address those differentials and curtailed the fiscal re distribution that offsets market- generated dispari - ties, even when output- increasing innovation is also occurring. This discussion is not ideological. Where initial impacts of innovation are inequitably distributed, and in the absence of resources for redistri - bution, social discontent could be exacerbated, innovation slowed and damage inflicted, over time, on every one. It is also impor tant to stress that public policy can and does influence the entirety and each stage of the pro cess from R&D se lection and its financ - ing, to technology development and its dissemination, as well as market structure, taxes, and subsidies. A technology policy that not only fosters innovation but also, from the beginning, has poverty reduction and a less sharply disparate income distribution as objectives would lead to much greater balance in the allocation of gains from technology than a policy that does not focus on these objectives, or tries to deal with them only at the late stages of the cycle. This latter adjustment would come after the basic allocations have been made by the dynamics of: market power; technology owner ship and rights; skills; available technologies; deployment choices in the use of methods of implementation of technologies and the investment climate\u2014 and subject to the interactions of par tic u lar technologies newly Foreword xiii available with the terms and conditions of access to their benefits. R&D initiates the pro cess. Competition and intellectual property policies clearly affect dissemination and distribution of gains. Education and skills train - ing affects the supply of needed workers, development capacities, incomes, and work force adaptability. Fiscal policy affects resources available for re distribution and investment incentives. Po liti cal values and priorities influence them all. It is the situation of impressive new technology, slow improvement of aggregate productivity, slow GDP growth and significantly increased income disparities and the above diagnostics that brought us together. Our analy sis began with the recognition of a systemic interconnection of technology, productivity, output and income distribution; their common determinants and the confluence of technical, economic, social, po liti cal and ethical con - sequences. The collaboration of the Chumir Foundation for Ethics in Lead - ership and the Brookings Institution attempts to gather a state- of- the- art description of the facts, of the best evidence of the causes (proximate and under lying), and indications of the variables and variations that might suggest appropriate policy action in pursuit of more fair, harmonious, pro - ductive, and innovative socie ties. What influences arise from technology\u2014 today's mix in par tic u lar\u2014but also from industrial, trade, financial, educational, and social policies\u2014or their interactions with technology and each other? What methods should be considered for offsetting disparities or addressing those disadvantaged and unable to protect themselves while continuing to incentivize and cap - ture innovation that generates the capacity to benefit all? The purpose of this proj ect is to stimulate an informed dialogue in our communities and governments about the increasing disparities in society and chronic suboptimal economic per for mance, and to consider what can be done to change or superimpose a reshaping of those dynamics or redressing of results that undermine economic productivity and fairness, trust in government, and social cohesiveness. The objective is to achieve an economy that stimulates and captures the gains of innovation, produc - tivity, and growth from technology in economic activity and captures the gains of global production rationalization and trade. The aim is to under - stand and foster a society that distributes income in a manner that serves the purposes of productive incentives, compensates equitably and is a so - ciety that enjoys cohesiveness, stability, and well- being.xiv Forward There are numerous pieces of analy sis on parts of these prob lems, but the research often does not link the productivity prob lem to the income distribution issues. It is our hope that this report will advance an integrated approach. Certainly distribution is easier to address in a context of stron - ger growth. We hope this will help to inspire open dialogue\u2014 particularly at a time of significant technological advances\u2014on the causes, effects, and optimal response to the concerns of slowed growth and widening disparities for a healthy economy and society. We hope to stimulate an interest in seeking \"productive equity.\" Joel Bell and Kemal Dervi Notes 1. This is not inconsistent with the per for mance of leading firms in pursuing cost saving innovations as well as product and ser vice development that creates obsolescence and repeat demand from their customer base. Moore's Law has con - tinued to apply. 2. Some ostensible transfer activity is more tax driven than market ser vice related, but the multinational firm remains a relevant factor for this analy sis.xvAcknowl edgm ents This report is the outcome of a collaborative proj ect between the Brook - ings Institution and the Chumir Foundation for Ethics in Leadership.

It would generate constantly easier, more appealing and demand- stimulating ways to satisfy needs and desires, from the most basic to the most luxurious or frivolous. Demand would not become satiated, as some economists had earlier speculated. This would not be just a passing condition resulting from postwar recon - struction and pent-up consumer demand. Despite momentary anx i eties over employment displacement from au - tomation, Joseph Schumpeter was borne out again and again as automation- led elimination of jobs produced higher- valued new jobs and, therefore, higher incomes and greater overall effective demand and employment. It appeared that unemployment\u2014 after making allowances for transitional frictional unemployment, growth of the workforce, and a shorter workweek\u2014 need be only cyclical in a well- managed economy. The utility of the hard- to- come-by savings of our parents and, by extension, of our generation was questioned in some quarters as those savings were dwarfed by the much higher earnings of their children, even at an early age.1 This secular growth mindset was supported by cost- reducing innovations and by mass market dissemination of new capacities through the life cycle of a technology. New technologies and innovations included lower unit cost and new ways to meet needs. Community- managed technologies con - tributed significantly. Targeted technological needs or functionalities for defense, space, and health- related programs generated publicly funded basic research, products and ser vices development, and procurement spend - ing. It was relatively easy to develop civilian derivatives once the public purpose was met. Public sector research and research funding maintained a pipeline of technology opportunities, providing successively higher value opportunities. With this came an expectation, if not a promise, that the sequence of R&D, technology, innovation, dissemination, lower cost mass and derivative production and growth would continue and would spread economic activity, gains, and well- being, domestically and globally. If the market mechanism needed complementary mea sures to achieve distribu - tional goals, growth was rapid enough that some re distribution could be achieved with taxes and transfers without hurting the incentives needed for investment and innovation. This causally linked sequence of R&D, technology, and innovation\u2014 and the feedback loops\u2014is an accurate description. But the subsequent stages\u2014 disseminating access to technologies, investment in their deployment, con - sequent growth, and more equal or converged income distribution\u2014 while observed at the time, were not inevitable. Changing influences on per for- mance at any stage in the sequence changes the stages further down the chain. From exogenous changes in R&D se lection and funding to shifts in conditions affecting the dissemination of innovations, market structure, or investment embodying such advances can change the dynamics and results. The fallacies in thinking that inclusive growth automatically follows technological innovation are now palpable in the disparities of income and wealth, as well as in lesser economic per for mance representing a lost growth/ output opportunity. This poses questions of a technical economic and tech - nological scientific nature, as well as of a psychological, so cio log i cal, and governance or po liti cal character. At its most basic, a worker can vary output per hour only to the extent of his or her skill and his or her speed at the task. The introduction of tech - nology and innovation can more significantly increase output per hour of work, mea sured as \"productivity.\" Where and how the value of added output is captured and influences well being, either geo graph i cally or by capital or labor, is part of the question of distribution. The ele ments that explain productivity and distribution are the topics of this work. They include: Market power and level of competition Se lection and investment in (and financing for) technology and innovation development and deployment Accessibility, costs, appeal, or uses to a firm of any par tic u lar technologyxviii Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xix Supply of required skills and human capital Effective demand for components and end products and ser vices Taxes and fiscal transfers that influence be hav ior, available re - sources, and income distribution Growth and Productivity: Demographics, Investment, and Potential Growth An economy's \"potential output\" is determined by the natu ral use of its factors of production\u2014 labor and capital.2 Aging populations across ad - vanced economies and some major emerging market economies will re - duce the available labor supply for those economies in the years ahead, all else held equal. Declining investment rates, particularly in advanced econ - omies, suggest that the contribution of capital will slow down, as well. In such a setting, technological advance and efficiency provides the principal hope for overall production to keep potential economic growth at a high level.3 A look at the data underscores the slowing trends on labor, and capital and their limiting of growth and productivity from which dynamics of income distribution arise. Actual Output Growth: In advanced economies, overall GDP growth fell, from 2008 to 2017, to 1.2 percent a year, a full percentage point below its longer- term average since 1990 and less than half of the pre- crisis aver - age of 2.7 percent. On a per capita basis, growth fell to under half its longer- term average, down to 0.7 percent a year from 2008 to 2017 com - pared to 1.5 percent a year during 1990 through 2008. In emerging and developing economies, overall growth since the crisis remained around the longer- term average of 5 percent, although it has been steadily decelerat - ing in recent years, down now to close to 4 percent. On a per capita basis, growth in emerging and developing countries has fallen to 3.5 percent from 2008 to 2017 compared to 3.8 percent since 1990. Aging Populations: According to the UN's World Population Ageing report, older persons (over age sixty) are the fastest-growing age group in the world, posing a further constraint on growth. Between 1950 and 2000, the share of the world's population that is sixty or older increased slightly, from 8 percent to 10 percent, and is projected to more than double between 2000 and 2050, from 10 percent to 21 percent. The aging pro cess is most advanced in developed countries. Though some developing countries, like India, currently have a large and growing workforce of younger people, the pace of population aging in the developing world is substantially faster than what occurred in developed countries in the past. Investment: Investment is fundamental for technological innovation and is a fundamental driver of labor productivity through its influence on the capital available to workers. U.S. net business investment as a percentage of net operating surplus fell from 50 percent in the early 1980s to 25 percent in the 2010-15 timeframe. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that this lower investment explains around half the productivity growth rate decline in the United States and the larger Western Eu ro pean economies. A com - parison of 2000-04 with 2010-14, when labor productivity growth in the United States fell from 3.6 percent to 0.2 percent and, in Germany, from 1.7 percent to 0.9 percent, makes clear that the shock of the financial crisis drastically reduced the pace of aggregate capital accumulation. The total cap - ital stock in the United States grew half as fast after the crisis as it had in the de cade before, falling from 3 percent a year from 1996 to 2007 to 1.5 percent a year from 2008 to 2014. In the euro area, growth in capital stock fell from 2.3 percent a year to 1.3 percent a year, and in Japan it collapsed from 2 percent a year to 0.2 percent a year. In emerging and develop ing economies, invest - ment growth had been robust, led by emerging Asia, but has been on a down - ward trend in recent years, slowing from over 15 percent per year in 2010, which was above its 2003-08 pre- crisis average, to around 4 percent per year in 2016, below its longer term average from 1990 to 2008. Potential Growth: Estimates from the World Bank proj ect that poten - tial output growth in both advanced economies and emerging and devel - oping economies will slow down in the coming de cade, led by slowdowns in the contributions of labor, capital, and productivity. Comparing average annual potential growth from 1998 to 2017 to projections for 2018 to 2030, potential growth is projected to decline from 1.8 percent to 1.2 percent in advanced economies, and from 5 percent to 4 percent in emerging and developing economies.xx Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xxi Market Power A thread that runs through the analy sis of the dynamics of technology, productivity, and distribution is that of market power and competition. Market power can be conferred by policy and technology, and its exercise has a great deal to do with distribution. Exclusivity or mono poly power, the antithesis of competition, generally reduces the drive to innovate and, consequently, constrains productivity. In limited doses, intellectual prop - erty policy has long relied on some monopoly- profit- like gains to motivate investment in R&D and innovation. Power can be acquired, constructively when limited, through unique know- how, first- mover advantage, and intellectual property rights conferred by law. Where acquired for reasons of economies of scale and/or con ve- nience, whereby one or a few suppliers fulfill all or a large proportion of customer demand (natu ral mono poly), regulation (or public owner ship meant to accomplish the same result) has been its companion policy. More recent \"winner takes most\" platforms and markets have generally had dif - fer ent characteristics. Use of power to cultivate further exclusivity by cre - ating higher entry barriers for others is, in some cases, characterized as abuse of market power. Power is seen\u2014 depending on degree, context, and use\u2014as beneficial, detrimental, or neutral; but it is, essentially, judged by its impact on creativity and distribution. Empirical research reveals creative leading firms deploying innovations, reaping rewards, and compensating personnel\u2014 particularly those in pos - session of skills in short supply\u2014 more generously than others in the same sector. But when they erect barriers and effectively keep other firms from catching up, the technology diffusion pro cess slows down, the economy loses the productivity gains of wider deployment, and the dynamic fosters disparities within a sector or employee skill set. Some leading firms become complacent and, on occasion, use monopsony power with employees, using buying power to limit their incomes in favor of owners or suppliers of capital. With more enterprise being global, firms have increasingly been open to international competition but also in a position to effect international dis - semination of technology within their own com pany network, extending and potentially increasing market power while retarding inter firm transfers that would increase competition, capturing savings from international ratio -nalization of activities. Globalization, however much responsible for dis - placement of labor compared to technology, has enhanced the power of capi - tal over labor with distributional consequences of downward pressure on wages. Technological displacement is accompanied by an output and income effect; globalization can reduce consumer prices and alter capital/labor split. With some 80 percent of international trade accounted for by multina - tional corporations and affiliates, given the importance of foreign direct investment, but with regulatory power lodged in sovereign states, larger international companies also have increased their market power by being able to escape, or at least minimize, some intended impacts of regulation. International collaboration on public interest and policy enforcement has not kept up, and national interests have been promoted by governments in ways that have reinforced corporate power by championing their country's leading firms in both domestic and international dealings, largely through domestic and international intellectual property and investment protections. There are numerous indications of reduced competitive forces. To begin with, in twenty- four OECD countries, firms in manufacturing and nonfi - nancial ser vices with twenty or more employees, which represented the top 5 percent of firms by labor productivity, saw their productivity rise by ap - proximately 35 percent, while the rest rose by only some 5 percent from 2001 to 2013. The leading firms are taking off while the rest are left behind. In the United States, between 1982 and 2012, the market shares of the top four companies by sales rose, on average, from 5 to 10 percentage points in manufacturing, utilities, ser vices, and wholesale trade, starting at 38 percent, 30 percent, 11 percent, and 22 percent market share, respectively. In retail trade and finance, the leading four companies boosted their mar - ket shares by 10 to 15 percentage points in the same period, starting at around 15 percent and 24 percent market share, respectively. It is telling that the average markup above marginal costs increased by more than 3.5 times between 1980 and 2014, from 18 percent to 67 percent. And new competitive entry, mea sured by firms five years old and less, accounted for about half of all U.S. firms and one- fifth of total employment, declining to about one- third and one- tenth at the end of the period. In other words, markets are more concentrated and profits are rising with higher mark - ups, yet there are fewer new entrants despite the profit potential. A 90th percentile firm saw a 100 percent return on invested capital, ac - tually five times that of the median firm, up from two times twenty- five xxii Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xxiii years earlier. Profits in excess of cost of capital across the U.S. economy rose from 3 percent to 17 percent of total U.S. income. In finance, the top five banks went from 25 percent to 45 percent of the sector's assets from 2000 to 2014 and captured 35 percent to 40 percent of corporate profits in the years before the financial crisis. In Eu rope financial sector employees rep - resenting one in twenty- five workers, were one in five of the top 1 percent of earners. The top eight multinational technology companies account for about one- third of the market capitalization of the 100 most valuable firms glob - ally, as of 2018. Patent lawsuits have increased by at least eight times be - tween 2003 and 2011 in the United States, suggesting a rise in the anticom - petitive use of intellectual property rights at the same time the private sector's share of total R&D spending has grown. It is typically harder for smaller firms than for big firms to endure costly legal battles or to develop the capacity to protect their own intellectual property. This has consequences for the dissemination of technology and the ability of a broader range of firms to catch up in terms of productivity and, consequently, wages. Nature of the Technology Diff er ent technologies have differing characteristics that influence whether technology proves to be pro- competitive and convergent or disparate in its distribution. These differences, which influence dissemination, individual and aggregate productivity, and, potentially, distribution of the benefits,4 include: The novelty, distinctiveness or constructive disruptiveness, and cost of production impact of the applications of a technology Economies of scale or tendencies to concentration or other wise Sector and/or need to which a technical capability is applied, and the scope and se lection of ways to use and deploy a technological capacity The significance and ease with which related know- how can be replicated by a non- inventing party, especially when assets are intangible and can more easily spill over to other firms The skills required for its application, their availability, and em - ployment characteristics The terms on which a technology is available to others In the postwar world, if not before, government procurement for space, defense, and medical services\u2014 particularly in the United States\u2014 drove a large proportion of research and product development. Support of research in basic science by grants and funding of R&D for applied capabilities\u2014 whether directly in government laboratories, by contractual specification of a func - tionality to be developed by third- party sources, or by subsidized private commercial activity\u2014 all contributed in a major way to technology develop - ment. Government goods and ser vices procurement served as a further driver and R&D se lection mechanism. Later commercial derivatives of the technologies and products developed under these public sector demands have accounted for a great deal of the technologies used in current industrial and consumer applications. Defense and space needs dominated the tech - nology se lection mechanisms and spawned industrial consequences for many years in an economy like that of the United States. By comparison, consider R&D for educational devices made available in public schools; or medical treatments developed in government labs and used in public health ser vices at no specific patient expense; or compul - sory licensing or other methods to ease competitive access to technological developments; and, perhaps, attractive pricing or consumer sensitive terms and conditions for end-user acquisition. These conditions and practices would all impact innovation, productivity, investment, growth, distribution and both economic and social results and income distribution consequences. Public social policy technological priorities (health, education, environ - ment), wealth driven demand, defense and space ambitions, and innova - tion introduction methodologies are fundamental drivers that would be expected to change R&D priorities and produce di ff er ent results in pro - ductivity and distribution. There are advocates for so- called \"pro- poor\" technology se lection and socially conscious deployment methodologies designed to focus more attention on the impact of technologies and inno - vation on distribution of benefits and gains.xxiv Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xxv This analy sis brings an admittedly economic and public policy perspec - tive to the matter rather than a technical one. But it is hard to think that there is a fundamental \"law of nature\" that involves a shift in the potential for technology today to lead to significant functionality or productivity change compared with historic levels of increasing productivity and out - put growth. Methods of technology deployment can have a material im - pact on the consequences of a new technology. These variables of technology policy merit further consideration, but any reported decline in the pro- ductivity of R&D, or in the functionality and productivity of currently emerging technologies, would seem to result from the se lection of research targets, research spending, market conditions, and policy choices\u2014or from the somewhat random timing of discoveries or developments\u2014and not from the exhaustion of scientific capacities. There is some evidence supporting concerns about new technology de - velopment. First, there has been a relative reduction in publicly funded and basic research. Additionally, the private sector focus is more on product development rather than technological research that may, over time, produce more widely impactful technology advances. Leading firm dominance and reduced productivity in R&D output are ele ments for concern. Moreover, the relative shift from defense and space contracting as a driver of technology and greater funding for consumer market- driven se - lection of priorities could conceivably improve the market benefits from technology, although consumer wealth- driven demand for technology is not necessarily expected to be more socially responsive or \"pro- poor\" in nature. The recent hesitation of the consumer- driven digital technology developers and ser vice providers to serve military needs, the liberal demo - cratic governments' worry about privacy, the public/private funding mix and the risk/reward debate over funding, risk absorption, and deployment review are as yet of unclear significance. Additionally, the impact of the emerging geopo liti cal technological competition\u2014or, perhaps even rivalry or conflict\u2014of a rising R&D player, China, is not yet fully evident. The rivalry for leadership and control of technology could become the counterpart of the Cold War arms race and impact development and trade in technologies. How significant new technologies emerge, are owned, are located geo graph i cally, or interact with geopolitics could involve impor tant output and distributional differ -ences. Consider, for example, the emergence of artificial intelligence under the owner ship of one or two jurisdictions, such as the United States and China, versus global participation. One notable observed characteristic of digital technology is the \"win - ner take all,\" or at least \"most,\" of the market embodied in the applications of such technology. This has obvious consequences for market power as well as for policy addressing the application of pro- competitive conditions to product or ser vice offerings. Technical standards, compulsory licens - ing, and third- party network attachments and access to technology are ele ments that might require more attention in competition policy if com - petitive forces are to drive conditions and be hav ior in sectors deploying the technologies. This, obviously, runs counter to the less regulated cul - ture with re spect to such ser vices. There are a few technology- related indicators that signal less technology- driven growth than is other wise pos si ble\u2014 all ele ments that impact distri - bution and income disparity. First, as noted earlier, in the United States, government spending on R&D in 2015 was on the order of 0.6 percent of GDP, down from 1.2 percent in the early 1980s. But the productivity of R&D spending has also declined and researchers indicate this reduction is related to the decline in basic research. Second, the rising importance of intangible or knowledge- based capital\u2014 such as the output of R&D, design, training, operating models, or know- how\u2014is reflected in the fact that business investment in intangible capital now exceeds that of investment in traditional tangible capital such as equipment, machinery, and structures. Between 1977 and 2015 in the United States, the share of intangible investment in GDP rose from 8 percent to 15 percent, while that of tangible investment fell from 16 percent to about 10 percent. This signals the importance of such issues as skills and educa - tion; the significance of know- how for methods of competition, regulation, and enforcement; and the ease of transfer of critical ele ments of market power, particularly within a com pany, even between jurisdictions. It also affects borrowing collateral to the detriment of the competitiveness of smaller firms and further skews the system toward greater concentration. Larger firms have greater resources and credit histories to finance in - vestments in intangible assets that do not have physical collateral (small firms rely more on bank loans, which often require collateral) and can xxvi Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xxvii more readily acquire smaller firms to expand their owner ship of knowledge- based assets, making them even larger and more dominant. These variables tend to suggest less, not more, competitive bias with consequent negative growth and income distribution implications. There are differences in economic and distributional impacts that arise from the case- specific characteristics of technologies, the prioritizing of technological prospects pursued in R&D, the mix of innovations intro - duced into an economy, the activities to which they are applied, and the methods of their application and deployment. There are risk/reward issues in regard to the development of new technologies that are of considerable distributional significance, particularly as related to public sector support, risk- taking, owner ship and control, and allocation of rights and revenues. These raise further policy questions and choices that impact the pace, na - ture, and distributional consequences of technology that drive so much of productivity, growth, and income disparity. A science and engineering review might identify other impor tant gener - alized productivity, output, or distribution characteristics of the current and emerging technology mix. But the evidence on significant characteristics of new digital technology\u2014 and on the role and tactics of the private sector, gov - ernments, and multinational enterprise in international dealings\u2014 suggests, in the market and policy conditions today, the continuation of concentra - tion of power and its impacts on productivity and distribution, producing slower growth and more income disparity relative to the potential. The pace of technological change may quicken through expenditures on R&D and investment/innovation\u2014 and the pace does appear to have quickened\u2014 but low levels of competition or the absence of sufficient in - gredients (for example, skills) still play a role in the consequences. The \"creative destruction\" adjustment (i.e., the replacement of eliminated jobs by the jobs created by the new technology, plus the jobs created by the de - mand that higher aggregate income generates) and the timing of the ero - sion of the early stage extra profits for the developer of a new technology are slower. Both dynamics generate more extra profits for leading firms; and, suboptimal productivity, slower than pos si ble growth and more un - even income distribution. What is less clear is whether the \"nature\" of the technology mix is affecting the growth and distribution results, but the policy issues would not appear to turn on the answer. Labor and Capital Distribution One direct link of technology and employment with productivity and in - come distribution consequences is through the increase in output per hour worked. Technological change is likely to shift the type or amount of work required for any given production or to bring a new offering to market. Higher efficiency may reduce the need for some workers, and increasingly capable automation technologies may eliminate some tasks or occupations entirely. On the other hand, demand for new tasks and jobs arise, raising issues of retraining, supply of human capital, skills matching, and overall labor market adjustment. Should the new skills in demand be in short sup - ply or other wise command higher compensation, income distribution can change. The capital/labor split of proceeds can also change as a result. En - suring no one is worse off, or correcting for a changed distribution, requires attention. Education for job/skill matching, adaptability to change, and social pol - icy to facilitate mobility are obviously relevant. But linear thinking may not produce the right conclusions. The numbers and proficiencies of U.S. students in mathe matics, sciences and engineering are a target of criti - cism and concern. But, there may be more than a lag at work in the fact that the United States remains the world's leading industrial and innovative economy. Like every aspect of this analy sis, the outcome for income disparity, productivity and growth\u2014 through innovation, employment, compensa - tion, and shift in demand for par tic u lar goods, ser vices, and workers\u2014is variable with the circumstances and policies involved. It is, however, evident that the extent and frequency of job change and skill requirements of higher value jobs are increasing and contributing to income disparity. Some magnitudes can be put on these matters. First, technological ad - vances in automation and its growth in applications in production pro - cesses that have contributed to wider disparities and job polarization have caused middle- skill routine jobs\u2014 those that consist mostly of repetitive tasks and are more readily susceptible to current automation\u2014to fall by almost 20 percent on average in OECD countries between 1995 and 2010, while the employment share of low- skill jobs, consisting mainly of non- routine manual tasks, rose by almost 10 percent.xxviii Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xxix High- skill jobs that generally require more education and command a wage premium rose by more than 20 percent over the same period. In 2016 post- graduate degree workers in the United States earned 215 percent of the wages of a high school gradu ate (compared with a 155 percent differen - tial in 1980). This, of course, contributes to wider income disparity. In the United States, middle- income house holds fell from 58 percent in 1970 to 47 percent in 2014. Second, in the pro cess, the capital/labor split of income has shifted to benefit owners of capital. Labor's share of total U.S. income declined from the mid-60 percent range to mid-50 percent from 2000 to 2015. Across the U.S. economy between 1973 and 2014 labor productivity increased 72 percent but lifted the hourly compensation of the median worker by only 9 percent. Productivity has grown by almost six times more than pay. The McKinsey Global Institute proj ects that two- thirds of the pro - ductivity gains over the next de cade are likely to arise from new digital technologies, setting the stage for the skills demand and policy debate. Of course adjustment policies, potential new forms of income security, and the possibility of a reduction in working hours are all part of the discussion. Also, a study published in the Brookings Papers on Economic Activity in spring 2018 found that the effect of automation over the period from 1970 to 2015, while displacing some employment (particularly, again, jobs focused on routine tasks), has been net employment generating, due to the replacement (likely more productive) jobs and demand seen elsewhere in the economy but generated by increased incomes from automation. How - ever, there has also been a notably slower growth in workers' earnings than in productivity and a resulting decrease in labor's share of the proceeds. There are two dynamics at work separately and together: globalization with off shoring that displaces some jobs and adds to wage competition with a generally downward pressure on wages, and technological change that dis - places employment through more automation but most often also provides capital and equipment support for increased labor productivity. The above- noted Brookings study concludes that there is no evidence that automation, even combined with globalization, is destroying jobs in aggregate. There is evidence of a notable impact on worker earnings, pointing to fundamental issues around skills required for new technologies, wage differentials and reduction of middle- income jobs. Without entering the debate over which influence dominates, most studies find that the impact of globalization on jobs and wages accounts for less than technological change, but there are sectors and substitutions reflecting both. However, offshore displacement without innovation, or displacement by technology that alters the supply/ demand balance for labor, each has its par tic u lar impact on income distri - bution; each contributes to its disparity, absent offsets; and each generally produces winners and losers. Empirically, there has been a net marked shift in the capital/labor split in favor of capital, as noted above. Disparities appear especially stark when looking at the top earners and asset owners, particularly in the United States. Between the early 1980s and 2012, the richest 1 percent in the United States more than doubled their share of the national income, from 8 percent to almost 20 percent, a level last seen before the Great Depression. Even more striking is the rise in the amount going to the top 0.1 percent over the same period, quadrupling from 2.5 percent to over 10 percent. Though less pronounced, the rise in the income concentration of the top 1 percent has been widespread across ad - vanced economies. In the last de cade alone, overall in equality as mea sured by the Gini index has increased markedly for most major developed and developing economies around the world. Beyond income, the wealth share of the top 1 percent is on average double that of income in advanced economies. Globally, forty- two people own as much as almost half, 3.7 billion, of the world's 8 billion population. (In the United States, three people own more than the bottom 160 million inhabitants; the top 1 percent held half the stock and mutual fund assets in 2013; and the top 10 percent held over 90 percent of such assets.) The top 1 percent globally are estimated to have captured 80 percent of the growth in wealth in 2017. International Dimensions The analy sis of technology, productivity, growth, and income distribution applies equally to the international setting and to economic comparisons between states, particularly in a globalized world. In a global economy versus a domestic economy the differences are essentially institutional and a matter of conditions being more diverse. Policy instruments for affecting xxx Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xxxi market power between states or their residents are di ff er ent; international agreements govern intellectual property rights and investment protection alongside domestic laws, practices, and competitiveness of market condi - tions. Although the visibility of international differences is higher in the modern world than in the past\u2014at least in the feelings of well- being or deprivation of those in lower living standard countries\u2014 the social affini - ties between di ff er ent national populations, particularly those more re - mote from one another, are less significant than most domestic bonds. That affects attitudes toward international disparities. In fact, income disparity mea sured for the world population has de - clined due to the significant growth in the past few de cades of the na - tional average income of several countries, par tic u larly very populous ones: China and other East Asian countries, India, and some countries in West Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Excluding just Asia, however, the gap between developed and developing countries, on aggregate, has barely changed. Domestic disparity, on the other hand, has grown within most countries. So, many countries are still left behind, and it is premature to con - sider income disparity to be essentially a domestic issue; it remains both a domestic and an international policy issue. The role of technology\u2014 and hence, the national interests in policies for intellectual property owner ship rights protection\u2014 differs significantly between the many countries in which little R&D or first deployment origi - nates or is controlled and those that carry out considerable R&D and orig - inate technology development. The self- interest for technology importing countries begins with a later step in the research- to- growth/distribution sequence. National interest in those cases begins with the international transfer of technology at lowest costs and widest pos si ble dissemination terms. However, international technology transfer is now increasingly undertaken in intra- company arrangements that extend power through cross- border control and international rules regarding intellectual prop - erty, thus delaying competitive dissemination among firms in di ff er ent jurisdictions. Nevertheless, international trade in goods and ser vices is a major factor in competitive forces, dissemination of technology and productivity, as well as income distribution domestically and internationally. Recall the often-repeated technology life cycle is that of R&D and innovation occurring in an advanced location; first product or ser vice production being under -taken at the source and at a price reflecting the market power of the sup - plier; followed by a search for lower-cost production methods and locations and more mass market distribution of the good or ser vice at lower pricing, resulting in easier accessibility for users. This progression is a particularly impor tant dynamic of globalization and of the digital era through fast communication technologies and, sometimes, massive scale over online platforms. In a more open and fair trade environment, globalized value chains raise competition for production, labor, and location. That, in turn, stimulates efficiency, dissemination, productivity, and growth. Global value chains have integrated more emerging and developing economies into global production pro cesses and have facilitated channels for technology transfer, as well as exposed domestic firms to global fron - tier firms. But the maturation of these cross- border supply chains suggests that productivity gains from participation in them may not continue to be as large as they have been in the last thirty years. And the competitive dy - namic is weakened, as noted, by a considerable amount of the cross- border activity being internal to international companies and affiliates, suggest - ing, increasingly, that international dissemination enhances corporate market power, increases surplus profits, grows leading companies' influ - ence over which economy receives what gains, and retards the dynamic of copying economies' mass production at lower prices of a good or ser vice in a technology maturation pro cess. If the pace of technology development increases, as it seems to have in some fields, early-stage market conditions become the norm. Governance issues, including taxation of global enter - prises and enforcement of competition policies or other regulations, are also less effectively addressed by domestic governments against global firms.5 In the two de cades prior to the global financial crisis, world trade grew twice as fast as world GDP. Since 2012, international trade has roughly kept pace with GDP growth. The slowdown in international trade expansion could be a contributor to slower productivity growth in both advanced and emerging/developing economies by virtue of weaker competition from abroad and, thereby, lower pressures to invest in or pursue lower-cost sources. That also results in less transfer of productivity- increasing tech - nologies embodied in such investment\u2014 all with distributional conse transfer of technology and knowledge from the world's technological leaders in terms of patents and R&D\u2014 the United States, Japan, Germany, France, and the UK\u2014to developing countries ac - counted for 0.7 percentage points (or 40 percent) of developing country annual productivity growth from 2004 to 2014, compared to 0.4 percent - age points a year from 1995 to 2003, according to estimates from the IMF.7 In other words, the impact of cross- border technology transfer on aggre - gate productivity growth in developing countries has grown over time. Other research points to faster diffusion of technology from country to country but slower diffusion of technologies within countries. Globally ac - tive, if not dominant, firms can more readily transfer activities between countries to capture lower costs and better serve remote markets while experiencing limited competition and capturing the lion's share of pro - duction cost savings in profits. The widening productivity gap between firms at the technological global frontier versus the laggards reflects this slowdown of competition related diffusion between firms. Cross- country differences in productivity explain most of the differ - ences in cross- country standards of living. While there are differences in the capital stock between developed and developing economies, capital as a share of output is roughly similar across countries, reflecting lower wages in the latter. In 2010, differences in productivity explained over 90 percent of the difference in GDP per capita between the United States and Malawi, for example, and around 50 percent to 60 percent of the difference between the United States and other advanced economies. In 2017, labor produc - tivity in the United States was around forty- two times larger than that of Malawi's. Over the last two de cades average annual productivity growth for em - erging and developing economies as an aggregate has been 2.5 percentage points faster than in advanced economies, at 3.6 percent a year compared to 1.1 percent a year, respectively. The gaps in average incomes between countries has also narrowed over time, as emerging and developing econ - omies became more productive and grew faster than advanced economies, on an overall and per capita basis. From 2000 to 2013, the worldwide Gini coefficient declined from 0.67 to 0.62. Though still at very high levels, overall international income in equality declined. However, as noted above, disparities within most major emerging market economies, with the ex -xxxiv Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xxxv ception of Latin American countries at least until recently, have risen at the same time. It is impor tant to note that not all emerging and developing economies participated in the income convergence with the advanced econ - omies. Led by China and India, average incomes in emerging Asia rose from 14 percent of the average incomes in developed economies in 1990 to 25 percent in 2014. Migration is another key channel through which knowledge diffuses internationally, and it can result in stronger trade links and productivity gains. One study finds that a 10 percent increase in the number of immi - grants that come from a country that exports a certain good can result in a 2 percent increase in the likelihood that the mi grant receiving country will start exporting that same good, competitively and from scratch. Re - search shows that not only skilled mi grants but also unskilled immigrants can improve productivity and income gains for native workers without crowding out employment. Immigrants can promote efficient task special - ization, as they take the jobs natives do not want and free up locals to focus on other tasks that involve higher value additions. In individual U.S. states between 1960 and 2006, an increase in employment of 1 percent due to immigrants from Mexico produced an increase in income per worker of 0.5 percent. Refugees that fled to Denmark from former Yugo slavia and Iraq from 1991 to 2008 were found by researchers to not impact Danish unemployment but rather increase wages by 1 percent to 2 percent over the course of four to five years. The key, of course, was Denmark's ability to absorb these incoming mi grants and integrate them into the labor force. These dynamics apply to forced migration as well, but the absorp - tion of very large, unplanned, sudden, and unmanaged arrivals in one location that is, itself, facing challenging economic conditions calls for ad - ditional methods and mechanisms if the absorption capacities on which this productivity improvement depends is to be maximized or even be pos si ble. While capital has moved out of the poor countries of the developing world over the last de cade seeking greater safety despite lower and nega - tive rates of return (at least in reserve currency mea sure ment), a growth opportunity that could reduce international disparities and benefit both high and low income countries can be seen in the existence of material amounts of excess savings in the developed world, still earning low, or even negative, returns. At the same time, many investment needs and opportu -nities for better returns are unaddressed in the developing world. Those investment proj ects would increase returns of investment, call for exports from the developed economies, and bring enhanced output and employ - ment growth to the economies on both sides of the transactions. And acceptable policy solutions to disparities are easier to find amidst robust growth. The contextual impediments and risks to such investment in the lower- income countries\u2014 and, hence, hurdles to increased productivity and growth\u2014 and to larger income with which to approach the reduction of disparities are more numerous in the developing world. The debilitating consequences of poverty pose significant constraints for investment: a low level of skills and education; likely greater market power of the leading firms; deficient infrastructure for social, public, and market ser vices; frag - ile states and often corruption- suspect governments; strained debt levels limiting resilience of the macroeconomic investment climate; and, in some cases, shocks/burdens of uninvited arrivals of displaced populations fleeing nearby conflicts, risks, and, increasingly, other conditions includ - ing severe income disparities. Investment in these more challenging con - ditions requires more deliberate methods and mechanisms.8 Macroeconomic Management and Fiscal Policy Macroeconomic management that stabilizes an economy and attempts to allow business decisions to be made without the concern of sudden surges or collapses in variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, or inflation, is of great importance for the investment climate and, hence, productivity. To commit their resources, investors have to expect a broadly stable over - all environment over a time horizon that will pay a reasonable return. Monetary and fiscal mea sures can affect both propensities to invest and choices in investment and consumption. Fiscal policy does not have only macroeconomic objectives, however. Almost all fiscal mea sures have impacts on distribution. Tax rates as well as tax breaks for certain activities are structural tools of public policy, just as are transfers and incentives from the government to the private sector. Together, taxes and transfers (which transform the \"primary\" income dis - tribution as well as the provision and capacities of di ff er ent segments of xxxvi Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xxxvii the population to utilize some public ser vices), cumulatively impact distribu - tion of disposable income. Comparing the pre- taxes and transfers to the post- taxes and transfers distribution is very informative about social and governmental values and about po liti cal prospects for policy change regarding the subjects of this discussion. The same institutions that produce the policies and results evi - denced in a market would be responsible for policy changes to address any concerns to which the data give rise. In this context, it is noteworthy that re distribution through public ser vices and transfer payments has produced a reduced offset of mar - ket inequalities in recent periods. Around 2013, OECD countries on aver - age reduced the index of market in equality by one- third through fiscal re distribution. Lesser fiscal capacity in the emerging countries is reflected in a smaller offset in those jurisdictions. From 1985 to 1995, fiscal redistri - bution in advanced economies offset 60 percent of the increase of market in equality, while between 1995 and 2010 hardly any of the increase was offset. This is a result of two circumstances. First, personal income tax progressivity was reduced. In OECD coun - tries the top rate declined from 62 percent in 1981 to 35 percent in 2015. Corporate rates fell from an average of 45 percent in 1990 to 26 percent in 2015. The United States just reduced this levy from a top rate of 35 percent to a flat rate of 21 percent. The effective tax rate on vari ous ele ments of wealth in the major countries that have such data declined from 0.9 percent in 1970 to 0.5 percent in the early 2010s. Second, net public wealth fell from 36 percent to 17 percent of national income between 1970 and 2015, while net private wealth increased from 326 percent to 500 percent of na - tional income. Tying It All Together The following figure displays the dynamics of technology and contextual - izes the factors, conditions, and policy levers that influence productivity and distribution.Summary and Conclusions Context of Technology, Productivity, Growth and Income Distribution Technology is the principal source of increases in output for any time or effort, a cornerstone of productivity, a central contributor to growth, and, in turn, a major determinant of improving living standards. The market summation constitutes the economy's output; and the relative power of the parties influences distribution of gains between workers, suppliers, pro - ducers, and ultimately, between capital and labor. The results impact the sentiments and po liti cal choices of members of society. Despite imperfec - tions in mea sure ments, these dynamics have evolved to produce markedly diff er ent results over the last two to three de cades from those of the imme - diate postwar periods, both reducing output relative to the potential and concentrating starkly greater proportions of income in fewer hands, be - yond par ameters that might be argued to support and reward innovation. Wealth disparity is some twice that of income disparity. Given that the results are the consequence of numerous and systemi - cally interrelated factors and market settings, it is no surprise that chang - ing pre- redistribution market per for mance requires the adjustment of the many policies that influence the determinants; nor that changing some par tic u lar policies does, as the reported research reveals, contribute si - mul ta neously to remedying underper for mance of productivity and growth, and ameliorating inequalities in income distribution. The po liti cal prospects, however, of significantly changing what was created over a long period will require a public airing and discovery of the shared self- interests in reform that the evidence presented in this report suggests. Our purpose is to set out the best evidence of conditions, their causes and effects, and to provoke an informed and constructive dialogue as to what policies and practices would produce a fair, harmonious, and productive so - ciety. The objectives of policy ought to be to stimulate productivity and growth from technological innovation, realize the efficiencies of global rationaliza - tion of production and trade, and achieve an income distribution that pro - duces an equitable result in society. For this, we must look to the aggregate, average, and array of results, particularly as there are some who lose from the dynamics of the pro cess, despite being faultless for their displacement from their work or loss of share. Those adversely affected are members of a xxxviii Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xxxix community within which we share a socio- political affinity and decision making pro cess\u2014that could, therefore, impede innovation and growth, as well as undermine social stability and cohesiveness, if not effectively addressed. Technology and globalization are not, alone, the causes of the per for- mance. Both are factors in the dynamics and tools in pursuit of our goals. There is room and need for debate over the specific policy provisions that would be appropriate to motivate innovation, produce optimal growth, and achieve an equitable distribution of output. But it does not take much foregone productivity or output\u2014 lost resources\u2014 that, if achieved, cap - tured and compounded constantly, could cover considerable costs of cor - rective mea sures. Policy Choices Very broadly speaking, the discussion should consider the effectiveness and po liti cal prospects of correcting currently unsatisfactory results along four, not mutually exclusive, lines: 1. Attempt to fix the myriad and interacting policies that play a role in shaping the results, including what is needed to enhance pro- competitive investment. 2. Assess opportunities to generate a higher level of investment by addressing factors that impede the reallocation of savings and re - sources from low to high yield opportunities. 3. Override distribution consequences of the market through fiscal redistribution and/or employment sharing or other social adjust - ment support for the purpose of less economic disparity. 4. Address directly the R&D and se lection of technologies to mitigate poverty and manage technology deployment in ways that benefit a wider community, including those who other wise capture a very low share of economic output.1. The Interacting Policies Competition Policy Increased market concentration, weak competition policy and enforce - ment, com pany use of market power, as well as diminished national government ability to enforce policies on global businesses and their prac - tices have reduced competitiveness markedly over the last two to three de - cades. Market power, including that conveyed by intellectual property rights and practices, under domestic law and international convention, in both technology-originating and technology-importing countries, reduces or delays competitive dynamics that, in the past, produced better economic per for mance and more distributed benefits. A fast pace of new technological development by leading firms regu - larly renews the extra profits and market power of those early adopter firms. Reduced competitive forces for the dissemination of innovations extend early stage profits for innovators and delay increased productivity in the lagging firms and aggregate economy. Increased disposable incomes for workers from higher value employment and enhancement of overall de - mand take longer; and are reflected in lower productivity, lower growth and less added worker income. The transition may be too long delayed to af - fect market per for mance mea sure ment or count much for policy purposes. While dominant firms seek to maintain market power, through fueling innovation for both cost saving and product obsolescence, they can also become complacent or endeavor to do so by methods that retard dissemi - nation and do not serve innovation, productivity, and growth. Similar ob - servations might be made of the methods of deployment of new technolo - gies where they affect productivity, adoption, and dissemination. Further, power ful global companies capture more of the savings from rationalization of production (compared with benefits to consumers and workers) and the leading firms highly compensate their top earners. Intra- company domination of international trade and technology transfers pre - empts control of remote markets and impedes effective competition from that source, further enhancing com pany power. Clearly, competition policy and enforcement are prominent policy issues raised by the data and analy sis presented.xl Technology, Productivity, and Distribution xli Technology Policy There seems to be no a priori reason to believe that the potential for tech - nological advance and its productivity contribution is exhausted or di - minished, and there is anecdotal evidence that suggests the potential for continuing significant productivity enhancement. Material changes are vis i ble in the technology cycle. An increased role is being played by the private sector in R&D, although sight should not be lost of tax incentives, government subsidies, public sector contracted research, and procurement policies and practices. Relevant changes that raise tech - nology policy questions are seen in a greater product focus of private R&D compared with more basic science research from public R&D; some evi - dence of reduced productivity of R&D; a propensity of private sector owners of intellectual property to litigate to reduce dissemination; tighter interna - tional control over technology dissemination by prompt intra- company transfers; and slower inter- firm access to developments. The quasi- natural mono poly characteristics of digital ser vices raise questions regarding competition- stimulating policy techniques like compulsory licensing, man - datory open standards, and attachment/access for competing ser vice/ application providers. Perhaps linking certain legally provided intellectual property rights to pro- competitive provisions\u2014 and international coop - eration in anti- trust enforcement\u2014 should become a more impor tant part of the discussion. Also, geopo liti cal rivalry between world powers is increas - ingly focused on comparative technological strength, the significance of which is not yet fully understood or felt in the market. There does seem to be a good case for renewed attention to the genesis of technology advance, risk bearing and reasonable rewards, balancing of competitive dynamics and technology development motivation and the globalized world. Universal periods of protection and uniform provisions of intellectual property rights are overly blunt tools for balancing, in diverse conditions, the protections needed for motivation and the dissemination that is essen - tial for best overall economic per for mance. Variable periods of patented exclusivity might be considered. Pro- competitive techniques that might differ by sector or by case- by- case assessment of conditions\u2014 for example, licensing or access to the opportunity to compete at individual levels of a xlii vertically integrated business\u2014 would be more cumbersome, but perhaps needed. The current situation calls for recalibrating. Education Policy Education and training also impacts market per for mance and income dis - tribution. For productivity, growth, and income distribution, policy should address the shortage of skills for higher value- adding jobs, the adaptability of a workforce to change with technological advances, and insufficient skilled worker availability, all contributing to limitations on growth and to skew - ing the distribution of gains to the more skilled workers. Potential easing of immobility of labor and other factors of production is relevant in some markets. Demographic Policy Aging populations impose constraints on demand and growth. The poten - tial for migration to be highly productive in maintaining demand and productive capacities, subject to the effective absorption of the mi grants, should form part of the policy mix. 2. Investment Climate Disincentives for investment by leading and/or lagging firms for reasons other than uncompetitive settings exacerbates the less than optimal invest - ment per for mance created by reduced competition. For example, lower re - turns from investment for macroeconomic reasons impede investment and, hence, limit new technology deployment. Whether the low return condition is transient or fueled by macroeconomic excess savings/low investment yields and low interest rates that cannot be reduced to stimu - late investment and reduce savings\u2014 a chronic liquidity trap or secular stagnation\u2014 may merit more investigation. But the conclusion would not change much in this discussion, as these all direct attention to searching out prospects for higher return investment. The needs in underdeveloped locations and their underserved history suggest such higher return opportunities. But public resources are grossly insufficient to mobilize much of those opportunities; and investment con - xliii ditions and these markets are very challenging for private sector capital. Reallocation of a relatively small but meaningful scale of funds from low to higher yields in such uses would make a significant impact, but requires new methods and mechanisms to address the impediments to such investments. Policies to advance this would be justified by the public interest in: increased global growth by higher returns for currently poorly yielding capital; export opportunities and greater output for the developed world; incomes and fis - cal revenues for the developing economies; positive social externalities in the form of engagement of the many unemployed/underemployed otherwise requiring assistance, while success would enhance stability, improve secu - rity, and permit bud getary savings on those matters. There are other significant, somewhat separate, impediments to invest - ment that are a challenge to overcome. Distrust is a drag on investment and considerations range from: financial market disruptions like the 2008 recession; to the very high percentage of institutional shareholdings with their short-term per for mance motivations that restrains some longer- horizon investment; underinvestment in infrastructure; the rise of less productive financial superstructure (itself facilitated by technology of data and transaction management and, perhaps, an example of the fact that di ff er ent ways of using a given technology can involve very di ff er ent impacts); policy and po liti cal uncertainty in the locations of many prospec - tive proj ects; governance instability and locations of conflict or corrup - tion; the deficiencies of developing markets (in education and skills; poor business, social ser vices, and infrastructure); to the mismatch of maturity between savings and investment opportunities, particularly in riskier locations where investors seek shorter payback periods. 3. Re distribution Override Taxes, transfer payments, and social ser vices can transform the \"primary\" income disparity. The same institutions that produce the policies and re - sults in re spect to output and income distribution are, of course, respon - sible for the policy adjustments noted. It should, however, be no surprise that re distribution through public ser vices and transfer payments has pro - duced a reduced offset of market inequalities in recent periods. Govern -xliv ment fiscal policies have materially reduced their revenues and capacities to offset disparities in this way. This is happening while adjustment is potentially most needed as a result of automation, which increases the number of workers adversely impacted (displacing particularly middle- level jobs), and for globaliza - tion that causes offshoring of some low-skill and middle-level jobs. Both phenomena increase the need for adjustment support as the economy works to benefit by moving up the industrial value chain through its innovativeness. Discussion of a revised social contract that finds other ways to share economic gains that are accompanied by socially disruptive changes for some\u2014 guaranteed minimum income, job sharing, personalized control over earned rights to look to social services\u2014 need to be part of the policy dialogue. 4. Pro- Poor Technology Policy Governments can\u2014 and, in varying degrees, do\u2014 select the technologies on which an economy focuses. Defense and space (which can extend to communications, data management, materials, computers, transportation, energy, and even health), health, education, and environment are among the examples of sectors chosen by di ff er ent governments for technology spending within their borders. Direct R&D activity, subsidies, procure - ment contracting, and tax incentives have all been used. There is scope for considering disparities or rebalancing that result from the sectoral focus of technology initiatives on socially selected R&D to better serve the needs of the lower-income population. Closing Thoughts Economics is sometimes defined as an examination of the princi ples for efficiency in the use of factors of production, the pro cess of allocation of scarce means to numerous competing ends. Po liti cal economy is more the pro cess for decision making on such matters under conditions of uncer - tainty. Cause and effect linkages are imperfectly understood from empiri - xlv cal observation. This is further complicated by a single factor influencing multiple consequences and also by differing results depending upon the context or conditions. Nonetheless, it is our mission to try to sort out the evidence and linkages to the best of our analytical abilities and to stimu - late reasoned discussion for the definition of specific policy and behavioral proposals. The first step is to recognize the existence of the issue. This pol - icy challenge involves us all\u2014 producers and consumers; investors and workers; skilled and unskilled\u2014 and affects the resources available for liv - ing standards and the cohesiveness of the socie ties in which we live. Kenneth Boulding once wrote, whimsically: Our policy, to be effective Must chase a suitable objective. So our economy should be Both Growing, Stable, Just and Free. The Dog would surely be a dunce Who tried to chase four things at once. Yet that is just the way we plan The task of our Economic Man. Notes 1. Approximately 90 percent of children born in the 1940s earned more at age thirty than their parents did. By the time those born in the 1980s were that age, the number was about 50 percent. 2. An economy would be \"overheating\" when actual output exceeds potential and underperforming when output falls below potential. 3. Actual output growth is the output per worker (or, labor productivity) mul - tiplied by the number of employed workers. Output per worker depends on how much capital is at the disposal of the worker and how well labor and capital inter - act. The same answer would be represented by the output per working hour mul - tiplied by the number of hours worked. 4. It is, of course, critical to distinguish between the availability of a technology to those using it to produce a good or ser vice for end users and the market pene - tration of the end-user offerings. Few manufacturers of a mobile device or infra - structure, with extensive market diffusion of ser vice to end users who are paying a high price, is di ff er ent than widespread dissemination among the manufactur - ers of that equipment, competition among which lowers the cost of equipment. In xlvi the latter case, competition among ser vice providers would be expected to lower the price of ser vices to the end user more than in the former case. 5. This trend can be seen in the intergovernmental management of intellectual property. International agreements have strengthened intellectual property and investment rights, reinforcing and extending market power of dominant compa - nies, thereby affecting competition and its results. 6. This has implications for international development in pursuit of the Sus - tainable Development Goals or management of mi grant populations. 7. IMF, World Economic Outlook, April 2018. 8.

Technology has been booming, led by digital innovations. Evidence of ad - vances in digital technologies is all around us\u2014 increasingly sophisticated computer systems and cell phones; digital platforms that are transforming information, communication, and commerce; and growing applications of robotics and artificial intelligence in industry and ser vices. Technology is a major driver of productivity growth. Therefore, with technology booming, so should productivity. This has not been the case, however. Paradoxically, as new technologies flourished over the past couple of de cades, productivity growth slowed in advanced economies and in many major emerging economies as well. Economic growth picked up in 2017 and early 2018, but the under lying productivity trajectory continues to be weak. The outlook for potential growth in the medium to long term, which depends crucially on prospects for productivity, remains subdued. Related to this \"productivity paradox\"1 is the investment paradox. In - vestment, especially fixed capital formation, has shown a per sis tent weakness in most major economies despite low borrowing costs and high corporate profits. Interest rates have been at historic lows since the 2007 global financial 2 productive equity crisis. The rate of corporate profitability dipped for a while after the finan - cial crisis, but the average trend rate has been high. Since technological innovations are typically embodied in new capital, weak investment has been part of the story of slumping productivity growth amid rapid techno - logical advances. The world today is more prosperous than ever, yet many socie ties are marked by increased discontent. So we face another paradox, one of mount - ing social discontent amid rising prosperity. Under lying this paradox is an increasingly unequal distribution of national incomes. The benefits of eco - nomic growth and the rise in economic prosperity have been unequally shared. While income in equality between countries has been decreasing in recent decades\u2014 thanks to the rise of faster- growing emerging economies that are narrowing the income gap with advanced economies\u2014 income in - equality within countries has been increasing. In advanced economies and most major emerging economies, income in equality has been on the rise. In these economies, the distribution of both labor and capital income has become more unequal, and income has shifted from labor to capital. Technological transformation and globalization have been two major long- term forces propelling the rise in economic prosperity. Yet, they are also the forces that drive much of today's societal anxiety\u2014 and, indeed, have been the subject of a rising backlash. Herein lies still another paradox. This is the backdrop that motivates this report and its focus on the two dominant economic concerns of our times: slowing productivity growth and rising income in equality. Together, these trends have produced weaker and less inclusive economic growth, caused a slower and unequally shared rise in living standards, and contributed to social tensions and po liti cal di - visiveness. These outcomes have fueled the recent surge in pop u lism and nationalism in many countries. History warns about the po liti cal conse - quences of sharp and unchecked increases in income in equality and related disparities.2 Are the slowdown in productivity and the concurrent rise in in equality just coincident, are they parallel trends, or are they connected by some com - mon factors? Given their significance and topicality, both these trends have been the subject of intense scrutiny by economists. Much of the analy - sis, however, has looked at them in isolation. This report pres ents an over - view of the findings of recent research and seeks to add value by exploring pos si ble linkages between these trends and by providing an integrated Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 3 narrative. It finds that the slowdown in productivity growth, the related weakness in investment in productive capital, and the rise in income in - equality are interlinked and have impor tant common drivers. A key cross - cutting factor has been the nature of new technologies and how they have interacted with policy and market failures. There is a strong nexus connect - ing technology, policies, and productivity and distributional dynamics. Technological change recently has not delivered its full potential in boosting productivity and has pushed income in equality higher. Global - ization also has contributed to the rise in in equality. Both these forces have caused business and job dislocations as comparative advantage and demand for skills have shifted. These outcomes pres ent tough challenges, but the cor - rect response to these challenges is not a Luddite retreat from technology or a slip back into protectionism. Rather, policies have a crucial role to play in helping firms and workers adjust to the new environment and ensure that technological change and globalization produce better outcomes for pro - ductivity and economic growth as well as equity. Productivity and equity are often viewed as competing objectives in eco - nomic policy debates, echoing Arthur Okun's \"big trade- off\" (Okun 1975). But recent trends shows impor tant complementarities between the two. Research over the past de cade has found increasing evidence that higher in equality hurts long- term growth (see, for example, Cingano 2014, Ostry and others 2014). The analy sis in this report adds to research on the consequences of in equality for growth. It looks at the causes of the rise in in equality together with the causes of the slowdown in productivity\u2014 the main driver of long- term growth. It finds that the two trends share impor tant common causes. Developments in productivity growth and eq - uity have been linked by shared dynamics. As the slowdown in productivity and the rise in in equality have impor - tant common causes, the agenda to boost productivity and improve equity is positively interconnected, with scope for win- win policies. We call it an agenda for productive equity , a theme captured in the title of this report. Such an agenda is best pursued through integrated policy frameworks that exploit the synergies between productivity and inclusiveness\u2014 and allow trade- offs to be mitigated. Figure 1-1 provides a schematic repre sen ta tion of the report's theme of productive equity, identifying the main common drivers of the slower productivity growth and higher in equality, and the key ele ments of the common forward policy agenda.4 productive equity To achieve better outcomes on productivity and equity, policies will need to rise to the challenges of the digital age. New technologies are transforming the economic landscape. Their impacts on the \"economic possibilities for our children\" may be even greater (Summers 2013). The digital revolution is reshaping markets and the world of work in ways that carry profound implications for policy. The agenda ahead will require new, out- of- the- box thinking and innovation in policies to harness the potential of technological advancement to foster more robust and inclusive economic growth. The era of smart machines will demand smarter policies. Near- term economic prospects have improved recently in many major economies as recovery from the global financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession has matured and aggregate demand and market confidence have picked up. However, the under lying challenges of slowing productiv - ity growth and rising income in equality, which predate the crisis and are more secular in nature, remain\u2014as do the policy and structural factors that drive these trends (Spence and Karniol- Tambour 2018, Dervi and Qureshi 2018). Recent improvement in the economic environment carries FIGURE 1-1 Productive Equity Productivity and Equity: Common Dynamics and Agenda Outcomes Causes Remedies Slowdown in productivity growth Rise in income inequality Barriers to technology diffusion and competitio n Rise of winner-takes-most markets Slowdown in investment-more rents, less investment Inefficiencies and inequities of rapid financializatio n Shifts in demand for skills caused by technology and globalizatio n Upskilling/reskilling falling behind in the race with technology Rising inequalities of opportunity Weakening redistributive role of the stateNational Reforms Revitalizing competition for the digital ag e Unshackling innovation and its diffusion Investing in skills for a changing world of work Revamping labor market policies and social protectio n Reviving investment in infrastructure Improving efficiency and equity of tax systems International Reforms Promoting a better, more inclusive globalizatio n Reshaping global institutions for the twenty-first century Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 5 the risk of policy complacency and neglect of the under lying trends. Rather, policymakers should use it as an opportunity to step up reforms to address the deeper agenda on which longer- term prospects for growth and shared prosperity will depend. The report is or ga nized into seven chapters. This first chapter provides an integrative and summary overview of the analy sis, findings, and main policy messages. Chapter 2 documents recent trends in technology, pro - ductivity, and income distribution. Chapter 3 delves deeper into produc - tivity trends with firm- level evidence. Chapter 4 synthesizes research on the causes of the slowdown in productivity growth. Chapter 5 analyzes the rise in income in equality and examines factors and common drivers that link increased in equality and slower productivity growth. Chapters 6 and 7 develop the policy implications and set out an integrated agenda for reviving productivity growth and reducing in equality, with chapter 6 fo - cusing on national- level reforms and chapter 7 on areas of international cooperation. The report focuses primarily on advanced economies and major emerg - ing economies. The examined trends in technological change, productiv - ity, and income distribution have been more pronounced in these econo - mies. Many of the report's analytical findings and policy conclusions, however, apply more widely across economies. Also, where necessary, a more global context is provided by broadening the coverage to include other emerging and developing economies. High- Tech Era with Slower and Unequal Growth \"Productivity isn't every thing, but in the long run it is almost every thing\" (Krugman 1994). The role of productivity as the engine of economic growth will likely become even more impor tant in the years ahead if the impulse to growth from factor accumulation slows. Notably, in many major econ - omies, population aging will constrain the growth in labor input. In advanced economies, the leveling off in labor force participation and edu - cation attainments will reinforce this effect. Since technological pro gress is the key driver of productivity in the medium to long term, how tech - nologies evolve and affect productivity will matter more and more to eco - nomic growth.6 productive equity The last two to three de cades are often referred to as a high- tech era, marked by a boom in digital technologies ranging from computer systems and mobile telephony to large digital platforms and industrial robotics. How significant are these technologies in their potential to boost productivity and economic growth? There is considerable debate on this issue. At one end are \"techno- pessimists,\" who see a long- term weakening of the inno - vation engine (Cowen 2011, Gordon 2016). They believe the new technolo - gies are inherently less consequential than their pre de ces sors and simply do not bring the kind of economy- wide productivity and growth benefits that were brought by past technological breakthroughs, such as the inter - nal combustion engine and electrification. They also believe that much of the fruit from digital technologies was plucked when they were first intro - duced and that subsequent innovations have been largely of an incremen - tal nature. Some won der if many of the latest innovations were \"more fun than fundamental\" (Krugman 2015a). At the other end of the debate are \"techno- optimists,\" who believe digi - tal technologies are transformative and do have the potential to drive rapid productivity growth; their benefits are merely subject to lags and come in waves (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2011, Mokyr 2014). They argue that even if the benefits of the first wave of digital innovations are considered to have been largely realized already, productivity could benefit from the next waves of innovation\u2014 such as radical increases in mobility from smartphones, cloud computing, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things. These next- generation innovations could unleash a \"fourth indus - trial revolution\" (Schwab 2016). The middle ground in this debate is occupied by \"techno- adaptationists,\" who see the continuing promise of the new technologies to deliver produc - tivity gains but note that the realization of these gains is not automatic and can be delayed or thwarted by a variety of barriers. The gains depend on complementary improvements and adaptations in workforce skills, orga - nizational structures, and policies affecting the functioning of markets (Sy - verson 2013, OECD 2015a). What do the numbers say? As reviewed in chapter 2, productivity growth has slowed significantly in advanced economies since the 1980s, and more recently in many major emerging economies as well. Some economies ex - perienced a rebound in productivity growth in the 1990s and early 2000s. Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 7 The rebound was most notable in the United States and appears to reflect, in large part, the adoption of digital innovations where the country has been the clear leader among its peers. But the rebound proved to be short- lived, and productivity growth slumped again thereafter. Over the past de cade, productivity growth in OECD economies has dropped by half or more of its level prior to the slowdown. The slowdown in productivity growth is broad- based, affecting more than two- thirds of the sectors (McKinsey 2018). It also extends well beyond the OECD economies. Over the past five years, productivity growth was lower than the long- term average in about 65 percent of countries (World Bank 2018). The global financial crisis accentuated the slowdown in productivity as aggregate demand fell, international trade slowed, and investment financ - ing tightened. There is a cyclical ele ment, therefore, in the post- crisis de - celeration of productivity growth. However, the productivity slowdown in major economies started well before the crisis, and the longer- term slow - ing trend suggests there are deeper, structural factors at play, which have slowed the under lying rate of productivity growth. Analy sis of the productivity dynamics at the firm level in chapter 3 pro - vides impor tant further insights. Productivity growth has slowed but remained relatively robust in leading firms at the frontier of the new tech - nologies. However, it has slowed considerably in the vast majority of other, typically smaller firms, pulling aggregate productivity growth much lower. Productivity growth appears to have slowed particularly in firms in the middle of the productivity distribution. Between 2001 and 2013, in OECD economies, labor productivity among frontier firms rose by around 35 percent; among non- frontier firms, the increase was only around 5 percent (Andrews and others 2016).3 While technology adoption lags across coun - tries have been declining over time, technology penetration across firms within countries has slowed (Comin and Mestieri 2013). The implication of this pattern of widening productivity gaps between leading and lagging firms is that the prob lem may not be the technology it - self but, rather, its lack of penetration. It is not so much that innovation has weakened greatly, as feared by techno- pessimists, as it is that barriers are preventing a broader diffusion of innovations across firms and limiting pro - ductivity gains, a finding more akin to the views of techno- adaptationists. The widening gaps in productivity per for mance between firms go some way 8 productive equity in explaining the paradox of advancing technology but slowing aggregate productivity growth. One view on the productivity paradox that has gained some traction is that it may be illusory. Productivity is underestimated, the argument goes, because statistics fail to capture fully the gains from the new technologies in terms of improvements in product quality and variety and provision of goods and ser vices that provide substantial utility to consumers but carry a low or zero market price (such as Google searches). Research finds that gains from new technologies are, indeed, underestimated but that this un - derestimation can explain only a relatively small part of the mea sured slow - down in productivity growth (Byrne and others 2016, Syverson 2016). For the most part, the productivity slowdown, and the related paradox, are real.4 Concurrent with the slowdown of productivity growth, income in - equality within countries has been rising. As reviewed in chapter 2, income in equality has risen in all major advanced economies since the 1980s, and quite appreciably in several of them, particularly in the United States. In - equality has risen particularly sharply at the top end of the income distri - bution. Wealth inequalities are more acute\u2014 roughly twice as high on average as disposable income in equality in advanced economies\u2014 and have in many cases increased even more sharply. Trends in income distribution are more mixed across emerging economies, but most major emerging economies also witnessed a rise in in equality over the same period.5 The concurrence of the slowdown in productivity growth and the rise in in equality is vividly illustrated by the trends in the United States. Labor productivity growth in the de cade to 2015 averaged less than half the growth rate of the preceding de cade. Over the same period, income in equality, as mea sured by the broadest mea sure of in equality (the Gini coefficient), in - creased by more than 10 percent. The income share of the richest 1 percent has more than doubled since the early 1980s, to around 22 percent, with more than half of that increase occurring after the mid-1990s. The share of the top 1 percent in wealth rose to almost 40 percent. A still more dramatic indicator of wealth in equality is that the three richest people in the United States now own more wealth than the entire bottom half of the population, a total of more than 160 million people (IPS 2017).6 Broader mea sures of economic and social well- being that go beyond the distribution of mone - tary income paint a similar picture of a highly uneven evolution of human welfare (Case and Deaton 2017, Graham 2017). Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 9 The Technology- Productivity- Distribution Nexus What explains the slowdown in productivity growth amid booming new technologies and the concurrent rise in income in equality? Chapters 4 and 5 address this question. A synthesis of recent research reveals that the pro - ductivity slowdown and the rise in in equality are interconnected, driven by impor tant common factors and mutually reinforcing mechanisms. Tech - nological change has been at the center of these productivity and distribu - tional dynamics. The interaction of the new technologies with product and factor market conditions as influenced by policies has been the major driver of the evolution of both productivity and income in equality. Technology, productivity, and distribution have been linked by a common nexus, with outcomes significantly shaped by the prevailing policy environment. Technology Diffusion, Competition, and Rents The slowdown in productivity, at its root, reflects a growing in equality in pro - ductivity per for mance between leading firms and the rest of the firms. Across major economies, the benefits of new technologies have been captured, for the most part, by a relatively small number of larger firms. Aggregate produc - tivity growth is typically slower in industries with wider gaps in productivity between firms. Barriers to a broader diffusion of new technologies are pro - ducing outcomes that are both inefficient and unequal. A weakening of competition is one impor tant reason for the adverse productivity and distributional outcomes. Lower competitive intensity in markets weakened incentives to boost productivity. Barriers to competition kept the forces of competition from working to prevent a per sis tent rise in productivity and profitability gaps between firms. The erosion of competition is reflected in a variety of indicators: rise in market concentration in industries, higher markups showing increased market power, and corporate ossification with declining business dyna - mism as mea sured by new firm formations. These trends are observable broadly across advanced economies but have been particularly marked in the United States. The share of the top four U.S. companies in total sales has risen in each of the major sectors covered by the U.S. Economic Census; be - tween 1982 and 2012, the rise averaged 5 to 10 percentage points in manu - facturing, utilities, ser vices, and wholesale trade and 10 to 15 percentage 10 productive equity points in finance and retail trade (Autor and others 2017). Over roughly the same period, average markup above marginal costs in U.S. publicly traded firms increased by more than 350 percent (De Loecker and Eeck - hout 2017). In 1982, young firms (five years old or less) accounted for about half of all U.S. firms and one- fifth of total employment; these figures had dropped to about one- third and one- tenth, respectively, by 2013 (Decker and others 2017). Evidence for OECD economies links weaker competition to slower pro - ductivity growth and wider productivity dispersion. In industries less ex - posed to competitive pressures, technological innovation and diffusion are weaker, inter- firm productivity divergence is wider, and aggregate produc - tivity growth is slower (Andrews and others 2016, Cette and others 2016, \u00c9gert 2016). With increased concentration of market power, the distribution of re - turns on capital has become more unequal. The return on invested capital has diverged sharply across firms, with the typical firm seeing only a mod - est increase in return but a relatively small number of firms reaping super - normal profits. In the United States, for example, the 90th percentile firm earned a return on invested capital reaching around 100 percent in 2014, which was more than five times the return earned by the median firm; this ratio was around two about twenty- five years ago (Furman and Orszag 2015). Markets shifted toward oligopolistic structures, giving rise to higher economic rents (Krugman 2016, Summers 2016).7 Reflecting higher mark - ups supported by increased market power, the share of \"pure profits\" or rents (profits in excess of competitive market conditions) in total income in the U.S. economy rose from an estimated 3 percent in 1985 to 17 percent in 2015 (Eggertsson and others 2018). The rise in the concentration of mar - ket power, and the associated increase in the concentration of income and wealth, has prompted some to refer to our era as a \"New Guilded Age.\"8 Competition Policies and \"Winner- Takes- Most\" Dynamics What explains the weakening of competition? Several factors appear to have been at play to varying degrees in major economies. These include flaws in the patent system that act as barriers to a wider diffusion of innovations; regulatory acts of omission and commission (deregulation unsupported by competition safeguards, and regulations that restrict competition); increase Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 11 in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) coupled with lax anti- trust enforce - ment; increase in overlapping corporate owner ship of companies that com - pete by large institutional investors; rise in rent- seeking; firm be hav ior showing greater adeptness in erecting barriers to entry through product dif - ferentiation and other means; and rising protectionism. Besides competition policy failures, new technologies are contributing to increased market concentration by altering the structure of competition in ways that produce \"winner- takes- most\" outcomes. Digital technologies offer first- mover advantages, scale economies, network effects, and lever - age of \"big data,\" all of which encourage the rise of dominant firms; and globalization reinforces the scale economies by facilitating access to mar - kets worldwide. The rise of \"the intangible economy,\" where assets such as software and intellectual property matter more and more for economic success, has been associated with a stronger tendency toward the emer - gence of dominant firms (Haskel and Westlake 2017). Digitization may also allow firms controlling big data to extract more of the consumer surplus through increasingly sophisticated algorithmic pricing and customiza - tion of offerings. The winner- takes- most dynamics have been most marked in the high- tech sectors, as reflected, for example, in the rise of superstar firms such as Facebook and Google. Increasingly, however, they are affecting broader seg - ments of the economy as digital technology applications penetrate business pro cesses more widely in other sectors, such as transportation, communi - cations, finance, and commerce. In retail trade, for example, the big box stores, which previously had replaced mom- and- pop outlets, are now los - ing market share to online megastores such as Amazon. Investment Slowdown The weakening of competition helps explain the productivity paradox, but it also helps explain the investment paradox. Private investment rates have been on a downward trend since the 1980s in most advanced economies. Buoyant investment in information technology bucked this trend in the 1990s, but it, too, peaked around 2000 and has waned since. Weakness in investment has persisted in recent years despite historically low interest rates. In the post- global- financial- crisis period, macroeconomic factors such as deficient aggregate demand, credit disruptions, and elevated policy 12 productive equity uncertainty depressed investment. But the trend decline in investment spanning the past three de cades points to the role of some longer- term factors as well, and the erosion of competition is one such factor. Studies of the United States and Eu ro pean economies find that decreased competition reduced incentives to innovate and make new investments (Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon 2016, \u00c9gert 2017).9 Firms wielding stronger mono - poly power invested less and made a lot more on existing capital through higher markups and rents.10 An increasing portion of the high corporate profits reflected mono poly power rather than productivity of investment. Financial wealth increased sharply, but this was not primarily embodied in new productive capital; much of it resulted from capital gains as mono - poly profits boosted the market value of existing assets. One study estimates that the share of total U.S. stock market value reflecting mono poly power\u2014 which the study calls \"mono poly wealth\"\u2014 rose from negligible levels in 1985 to around 80 percent in 2015 (Kurz 2017). The investment and productivity paradoxes fed each other through a negative feedback loop between investment and productivity. Low invest - ment depressed productivity growth by limiting capital deepening and slowing the adoption of capital- embodied new technologies. Lower ex - pected productivity growth depressed investment.11 In addition to lower private investment in plant and equipment, invest - ment in infrastructure declined, adding to the forces pulling down produc - tivity growth (Ollivaud and others 2016, Adler and others 2017). Widening infrastructure gaps dampened the productivity of private investment, es - pecially of smaller enterprises, and weakened prospects for broad- based growth in economic opportunities that a strong infrastructure foundation supports. Rise of Finance Inefficient and unequal outcomes resulting from decreased competition have been compounded by resource misallocations and skewed rewards arising from rapid financialization (OECD 2015b, Philippon 2016). In the credit boom that preceded the global financial crisis, the lion's share of the credit went to house holds rather than firms, boosting stock and real es - tate markets rather than productive investment\u2014an allocation of credit with negative implications for growth, stability, and income distribution. Credit Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 13 disruptions that followed the crisis hurt investment and spending on devel - opment and adoption of new technologies, particularly by smaller firms (An - zoategui and others 2016). There has been much innovation in financial ser vices based on the new technologies. A large part of it, however, has been focused so far on areas such as trading and asset management (especially tailored to the well- off) that do not have first- order effects on productivity. Rewards in the financial sector rose sharply relative to the real economy. In the United States, for example, the financial sector captured an outsize share of profits\u201435 percent to 40 percent of all corporate profit in the years leading to the financial crisis. A sizable part of these high profits reflected rents in an increasingly concentrated sector; the top five banks' share of banking assets increased from 25 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2014. In Eu ro pean countries, financial sector workers on average accounted for one in five of the top 1 percent of earners even though they accounted for only one in twenty- five of the total workforce (Denk 2015). High rewards lured talent away from potentially more productive activities.12 Financial wealth boomed but benefited mainly those at the top; in the United States, the top 1 percent of the wealth distribution held half of stock and mutual fund as - sets in 2013, and the top 10 percent held more than 90 percent (Wolff 2014). Labor Income Dynamics In labor markets, a similar interplay between technology, productivity, and distribution to that seen in product and financial markets has been at work. Across OECD economies, increased in equality in firm productivity is mirrored by increased in equality in labor incomes. As productivity gaps widened between firms, so did wage gaps. Rent sharing also contributed to wider wage differences between firms. Better- performing firms reaped a higher share of total profits and shared part of their supernormal prof - its with their workers. Increased fissuring of the workplace through out - sourcing played a role as well, with non-core activities typically employing low- skill workers farmed out to other firms, cutting such workers from the rent sharing. Between- firm wage in equality rose more in industries that invest more intensively in the new digital technologies. Overall, wage in - equality has risen sharply in the past couple of de cades, and much of that rise is attributable to increased wage differences between firms (Song and others 2015).14 productive equity Much of the public debate on rising income in equality has focused on the top 1 (or 0.1) percent versus the rest\u2014 CEOs, top man ag ers, and profes - sionals versus other workers\u2014 and steep increases in earnings at the very top have, indeed, been an impor tant factor. But a large part of the rise in earnings in equality is related to increased wage gaps more broadly across the workforce, and particularly between more and less successful firms. While workers in firms at the technological frontier earned more than those in other firms, gains from higher productivity at these firms were shared unevenly, with wage growth lagging productivity growth. Wages rose in the better- performing firms but by less than the rise in productiv - ity. For most other firms, limited wage growth reflected limited productiv - ity growth, although even at these firms wage growth tended to fall short of the meager gains in productivity (Schwellnus and others forthcoming). In the United States, net labor productivity increased by 72 percent between 1973 and 2014, while real hourly compensation of the median worker in - creased by only 9 percent (Bivens and Mishel 2015). The decoupling of wages from productivity contributed to a shift in in - come distribution from labor to capital. Over the past couple of de cades, most advanced economies have experienced both increasing in equality of labor earnings and declining labor income shares.13 In the United States, for example, the percentage share of labor in total income dropped from the mid-60s around 2000 to the mid-50s around 2015. Labor income shares also fell over this period in most major emerging economies. Increased market concentration has played a role in the shifting of in - come from labor to capital as it reallocated labor within industries to domi - nant firms with supernormal profits and lower labor income shares (Autor and others 2017). Dominant firms not only acquired more mono poly power in product markets to increase markups and extract higher rents but also monopsony power to dictate wages in the labor market (CEA 2016; Azar and others 2017). A new phenomenon has been the fast- expanding digital labor markets\u2014 online jobs platforms such as Task Rabbit and Amazon Mechanical Turk. Here, too, employer concentration has been high (Dube and others 2018). While employer market power strengthened, worker bar - gaining power weakened with a decline in unionization and erosion of minimum wage laws. These developments reinforced the effect of labor- substituting techno - logical change on the distribution of income between labor and capital. Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 15 Production shifted toward firms and pro cesses using more capital (tangi - ble and intangible) and less labor. The largest U.S. firm in 2017 (Apple) had a market capitalization that was forty times as high as that of the largest U.S. firm in 1962 (AT&T) but its total employment was only one- fifth that of the latter (West 2018). The shift of income from labor to capital increased overall income in equality, as capital owner ship is highly uneven.14 International trade and offshoring also contributed to the shift in in - come toward capital by putting downward pressure on wages, especially of lower- skilled workers in tradables sectors. Overall, research suggests that globalization has played a significant role in the decline of the labor income share. However, it also shows that globalization's role has been much smaller than that of technological change and related outcomes (IMF 2017a).15 Race between Technology and Skills Technology has been the key force in changing the structure of the de - mand for labor. Digital technologies and automation have shifted demand toward higher- level technical and managerial skills. In advanced econo - mies, globalization has exerted pressure in the same direction. Demand has shifted, in par tic u lar, away from routine, middle- level skills that are more vulnerable to automation, as in jobs like bookkeeping, clerical work, and repetitive production. Job markets have seen an increasing polariza - tion, with the employment share of middle- skill jobs falling and that of higher- skill jobs, such as technical professionals and man ag ers, rising. The employment share of low- skill jobs has also increased but mainly in non- routine manual jobs in ser vices such as personal care that are hard to au - tomate. Over the period 1995-2015, the share of middle- skill jobs in total employment fell by about 9.5 percentage points in OECD economies on average, while the shares of high- skill and low- skill jobs rose by about 7.5 and 2 percentage points, respectively.16 A concurrent development has been the rise of the \"gig economy,\" with more workers engaged in nonstandard work arrangements such as temporary or part- time contracts and own- account employment. As the demand for skills has shifted, supply has been slow to respond. Education and training have been losing the race with technology (Goldin and Katz 2008, Autor 2014). Shortages of technical and higher- level skills demanded by the new technologies are partly responsible for the paradox 16 productive equity of slowing productivity growth in the midst of booming technology; skill shortages have prevented a broader diffusion of the innovations across economies. Workers with skills complementary with the new technologies have been clustered increasingly in leading firms at the technological fron - tier. Across industries, skill mismatches have increased; in OECD countries, on average around one- quarter of workers report a mismatch between their skills and those required by the job (Adalet McGowan and Andrews 2015). Imbalances between skills supply and demand have fueled income in - equality by increasing the wage premia on higher- level skills (Hanushek and others 2013, Autor 2014). The skill premium rose in all major economies, especially over the 1980-2000 period. The rise has been particularly sharp in the United States. Those with a post- graduate degree could expect to earn around 215 percent of the wages received by those with only a high school education in 2016, compared to around 155 percent in 1980.17 The rise in nonstandard work arrangements imparted more flexibility to the labor mar - ket. However, it prob ably also contributed to increased earnings in equality as nonstandard jobs (especially at lower skill levels) typically carried lower earnings than standard jobs. Inequalities of Opportunity Reducing inequalities in educational attainment takes on added significance with skill- biased technological change, both for the individual and the economy at large. Even as pre- collegiate achievement gaps have narrowed in many economies, gaps in higher education have widened. In the United States, for example, college enrollment and completion gaps by income level increased over the past few de cades (Turner 2017). Almost two- thirds of workers in the U.S. labor force do not have a college degree. Access to con - tinuing education and retraining is typically more difficult for lower- skilled workers\u2014 those who need it more as skill needs shift. Education and train - ing are key to broadening economic opportunity. Per sis tent and rising dis - parities in these areas suggest that it is not only the inequalities of outcomes that have increased; inequalities of opportunity have risen as well, with ad - verse implications for both future growth and equity. Studies for OECD economies find that higher income in equality and as - sociated higher inequalities in educational attainment reduce intergenera - tional income mobility (Krueger 2012, Corak 2013).18 A recent study of the Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 17 United States finds that the proportion of children who earn more at age thirty than their parents did fell to about 50 percent for the cohort born in 1980 compared with about 90 percent for the cohort born forty years earlier (Chetty and others 2016). The largest decline in mobility has oc - curred for families in the middle of the income distribution. This finding aligns with the concurrent trend of loss of middle- skill jobs in advanced economies\u2014 and the middle- class squeeze in these economies as traced by what has come to be known as \"the elephant chart\" (Lakner and Milanovic 2016).19 State's Redistributive Role As technological change and developments in product and labor market drove income in equality higher, the state's role in alleviating the in equality of market incomes arising from the interplay of these forces weakened. In advanced economies, taxes and transfers (such as public pensions and so - cial assistance benefits) reduce market income in equality on average by about one- third; in 2015, the average Gini coefficient for disposable income in these economies was 0.31 compared with 0.48 for market income.20 Be- tween 1985 and 1995, fiscal re distribution offset about 60 percent of the in - crease in market income in equality in advanced economies. Between 1995 and 2010, it hardly offset any (OECD 2016). Fiscal re distribution declined because of reduced progressivity of per - sonal income taxes and lower taxes on capital as well as tighter spending on social programs as countries took steps to rein in fiscal deficits and ris - ing public debt. In OECD economies, the average top personal income tax rate fell from 62 percent in 1981 to 35 percent in 2015. Lower tax progres - sivity accentuated top income in equality. International tax competition resulting from capital mobility led to a large fall in corporate income tax rates as well. The average corporate tax rate in advanced economies fell from around 45 percent in 1990 to 26 percent in 2015 (IMF 2017b). A core part of the U.S. tax system changes enacted in late 2017 was the lowering of the corporate tax from a top rate of 35 percent to a flat rate of 21 percent. It is not only the lowering of the personal and corporate income tax rates that reduced tax system progressivity. Most tax systems today are characterized by a motley of tax breaks, many of which are regressive\u2014 and also distort market incentives and hurt productivity.18 productive equity Productive Equity: An Agenda for Our Times The proverbial economic pie has been growing more slowly and unequally, fueling social discontent and populist politics. To achieve stronger and more inclusive economic growth, the twin trends of slowing productivity and ris - ing in equality seen over the past couple of de cades must be reversed. These trends are closely linked. Policies to overcome these trends are linked as well. The politics of reform is inevitably complex and difficult, but policy action must not be para lyzed by continued trite debates about conflicts be - tween growth and equity. Policy options are not limited to a binary choice of one or the other.21 There is a broad range of policies that can help achieve better outcomes for both productivity and economic growth as well as eq - uity. Linkages between productivity and equity call for an integrated agenda to promote these goals\u2014an agenda for productive equity. Policies to promote equity are often seen narrowly in terms of re - distribution\u2014 tax and transfer policies, which can be po liti cally controver - sial and divisive. But as the foregoing analy sis of the interlinked dynamics of productivity and equity suggests, there is a much broader policy agenda of \"predistribution\" that can make the growth pro cess itself more inclusive\u2014 and more robust at the same time. Politicians may find it easier to build winning co ali tions around this agenda. Inevitably, there are trade- offs. Advances in digital technologies hold much promise to boost productivity and human welfare. However techno - logical change is inherently disruptive and, indeed, achieves much of its positive impact through what Joseph Schumpeter termed \"creative destruc - tion.\" Positive economic outcomes from globalization inevitably entail winners and losers. Right policies help balance these effects and facilitate adjustment. Policy failures can exacerbate them. Both technological change and globalization have contributed to the significant rise in income in - equality that has taken place, but these distributional consequences are not pre- ordained. Much depends on how these forces are managed. Poli - cies matter and must do better (Tyson and Spence 2017). Technology is changing how firms compete and grow in markets, and it is changing the nature of work and demand for skills. The new dynamics pose fresh challenges for policymakers, calling for new thinking, experi - mentation, and learning. Policies will need to be more proactive in respond - Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 19 ing to change. Close to two- thirds of potential productivity growth in advanced economies over the next de cade could be related to the new digital technologies (McKinsey Global Institute 2018), underscoring the importance of responsive policies to capture the full potential of these technologies to deliver higher productivity and broad- based improvements in economic well- being. The backlash against globalization threatens a retreat into economic na - tionalism and inward- looking policies. Much of the ire has been directed at international trade for causing job and earnings losses for less skilled workers\u2014 even though technological change has been the bigger force. Rules for international engagement must be fair. But national policies\u2014 notably those affecting competition, skill development, and social protection\u2014 have a key role in ensuring that globalization works for all. In an increasingly interdependent world economy, national and international policies must work better together. Chapters 6 and 7 develop the agenda for national and international re - forms, respectively, in some detail. The major responsibility for boosting productivity and reducing in equality\u2014 and thereby fostering more robust and inclusive economic growth\u2014 rests with national policies. The reform agenda is broad. Countries will need to define and sequence policy actions depending on their specific circumstances. Given the agenda's scope and interconnectedness, it would pay to underpin policy formulation with a strategic overview of the objectives, priorities, linkages, and a whole- of- government approach. National Reforms Financial crises cast a long shadow. Much of the attention of policymakers in major economies in recent years has been focused on the more immedi - ate agenda of responding to the global financial crisis and the ensuing recession. Boosting aggregate demand and restoring financial sector stabil - ity and normalizing credit conditions have been priority areas for policy action. Economic recovery has been slow but has shown greater vigor more recently, with the near- term growth outlook improving noticeably in most economies in 2017. Among advanced economies, the recovery is further 20 productive equity advanced in the United States than in most Eu ro pean economies. In - vestment has picked up with stronger aggregate demand, but modestly so far. Corporate and bank balance sheets have improved, and bank capital buffers have been strengthened\u2014 again more in the United States than in Eu rope, though Eu rope seems to be catching up. Lessons learned from the pre- crisis excesses of the financial system are being translated into im - proved regulatory frameworks. With pro gress in addressing the macrofinancial legacies of the finan - cial crisis, attention must shift more to reforms that will drive longer- term economic prospects. While short- term growth prospects have improved, estimates of long- term potential output growth that depend crucially on productivity do not show the basis for a sustained acceleration of growth. The slowdown in productivity is not a transitional phenomenon that the cyclical economic recovery alone will resolve. The new technologies have the potential to produce a turnaround in productivity over the coming de cade, but the realization of that potential will depend on efforts to address the under lying causes of the slowdown (McKinsey Global Institute 2018). Without such efforts, the slowdown could even worsen (World Bank 2018). Meanwhile, income and wealth inequalities within countries have contin - ued to mount. According to one estimate, four of five dollars in growth in global wealth in 2017 accrued to the richest 1 percent (Credit Suisse 2017). Policymakers need to confront these challenges through deeper reforms of markets, policies, and institutions as they steer economies toward more robust and inclusive growth. As economies recover from the crisis, there has been debate about the relative roles of demand- and supply- side policies in boosting productiv - ity. Looking ahead, the demand and supply sides will be closely linked. Be - yond the cyclical recovery in demand, sustained growth in demand will depend greatly on improvements on the supply side. For example, improve - ments in market competition, diffusion of new technologies, and access to complementary skills and infrastructure will matter for investment de - mand. Policies that counter rising income in equality and promote broad- based growth in incomes, such as training and transition support programs that help displaced workers move to well- paying new jobs, will matter for consumption demand. Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 21 Revitalizing Competition for the Digital Age One key crosscutting area of reform is to reinvigorate competition and re - vamp competition policies for the digital age. The weakening of competi - tion in markets has been a key link in the nexus connecting the slowdown in productivity and investment and the rise in income and wealth in - equalities. Competition is a strong spur to innovation- embodying invest - ment, the adoption and diffusion of innovation, and productivity growth. It also promotes more inclusive growth by providing a level playing field to businesses and greater opportunities for workers. Regulatory reform is impor tant, but it should not be just about deregulation. It should aim to remove regulations that impede competition. It should also ensure that ad - equate rules and regulations are in place where needed to prevent exces - sive concentration of market power and its abuse. There is considerable scope for regulatory reform in a number of OECD economies, especially in network and ser vice industries (OECD 2017a). The M&A activity in these economies has more than doubled since the 1990s, helped by more accommodative anti- trust policies. Given the rise in industrial concen - tration, the robustness and enforcement of anti- trust regimes merit special attention. There is a need to rethink anti- trust laws and other competition poli - cies for the digital age where the new technologies tend to produce winner- takes- most dynamics and quasi- natural monopolies. Once in dominant positions, firms often work to entrench themselves by erecting a variety of barriers to entry, discouraging business dynamism and further innovation. The beneficiaries of an open, competitive system often work to close the system and stifle competition, necessitating reform to \"save capitalism from the cap i tal ists\" (Rajan and Zingales 2003, Krugman 2015b). Regulators need to understand the nature of the new market dynamics, such as the differ - ences between today's digital platforms and networks and how they differ from the network industries of the past, and devise new tools to identify and address noncompetitive be hav ior. With the rise of \"big data,\" regula - tions pertaining to how user data are handled, access to those data, and pri - vacy protections matter increasingly for competition and the availability of this information in wider research and further innovation (West and Allen 2018). Competition policy also needs to become more global to address cross- border business practices that restrict competition; today's 22 productive equity superstar firms typically are multinationals that affect competition in markets in many countries. In addition to product markets, enhancing competition is also key to deeper reform of financial markets, to complement pro gress made in strengthening prudential regulation. It would help address prob lems asso - ciated with size, increased concentration, interconnectedness, and rent- seeking. It would spur better use of advances in digital technology to expand the range of financial ser vices and reduce their cost, open new gateways to entrepreneurship, and de moc ra tize access to finance. Innovations such as mobile financial ser vices, digital platforms, equity crowdfunding, and blockchains have much potential. Young FinTech firms are in the vanguard in the application of such innovations. A challenge for policymakers is to foster the growth of these new entrants into the financial industry while managing associated risks. Unshackling Innovation and Its Diffusion A second area to reform is technology policies, both to boost innovation at the technological frontier and promote its broader diffusion across econo - mies. Intellectual property regimes need to be better balanced so they re - ward innovation but also foster wider economic impacts. There is evidence suggesting that stronger patent protection may be associated with greater market concentration, less follow-on innovation and diffusion, and wider productivity gaps within industries (Andrews and others 2016, Autor and others 2017). \"The copyright and patent laws we have today look more like intellectual mono poly than intellectual property\" (Lindsey and Teles 2017). Patent abuses\u2014 rent seeking, defensive patent thickets, trolling, and frivolous litigation\u2014 are pervasive. Arguing that patents are locking in in - cumbents' advantages rather than spurring the hoped- for bursts of inno - vation, some have even called for a complete abolition of the patent system (Boldrin and Levine 2013). That would seem too radical a step. However, a fundamental review of the patent system seems warranted to reform overly broad and stringent protections and give freer rein to competition that, ultimately, is the primary driver of innovations and their economy- wide penetration. Also, public investment in research and development (R&D), which has declined in many major economies, needs to be bolstered. In the United Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 23 States, for example, government spending on R&D fell from 1.2 percent of GDP in the early 1980s to half that level in 2015 (Shambaugh and others 2017). Public R&D, with its focus on basic research, complements private applied R&D. A recent study finds that productivity of overall R&D spend - ing has declined and suggests that the fall in public investment in basic research could be a contributory factor (Bloom and others 2017). Many breakthrough innovations developed commercially by the private sector had their origin in research at government research institutes, defense- related research programs, and publicly supported research programs at universities.22 Public research programs should ensure broad access to the fruits of direct public R&D investment as well as access on a level footing by firms to any private R&D incentives provided through tax relief and grants. Governments could also explore ways of better recouping some of their investment in research to help replenish their R&D bud gets through a better balance in sharing risks and rewards of public research investment compared with the current paradigm where risks are socialized but rewards are privatized. Investing in Skills for a Changing World of Work A third area is boosting and re orienting investment in skills. Advances in digitization, robotics, and artificial intelligence have led some to draw up dire scenarios of massive job losses from automation (a \"robocalypse\"), such as half or more of the jobs in OECD economies being at risk (see, for ex - ample, Frey and Osborne 2013, Ford 2015, and World Bank 2016). However, how many jobs will be killed by automation may be the wrong question to focus on, as it considers only the destruction of existing jobs and ignores the creation of new jobs by the new technologies and economic growth. Experience with past major episodes of automation shows that as techno - logical change made some old jobs redundant, it created new ones comple - mentary with the new technologies. How technological change impacts employment must be seen as a dynamic adjustment pro cess of old jobs and tasks giving way to new ones (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018b, Autor and Salomons 2018). Looking ahead, not only will the skill needs of jobs con - tinue to evolve, but the composition of employment will evolve as well, with more people working independently\u2014 including as microentrepreneurs in an expanding \"crowd- based capitalism\" enabled by digital platforms, as 24 productive equity exemplified by Uber and Airbnb (Sundarajan 2016, Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2017). The main issue is that the nature of work is changing, and the main pol - icy challenge is to equip workers with nonroutine, creative, and higher- level skills that the new technologies demand and support workers during the adjustment pro cess. The key to winning the race with technology is not to compete against machines but to compete with machines. Education and training programs must be strengthened and revamped to respond to the new skill dynamics. Traditional formal education must be complemented with new models and options for reskilling and lifelong learning, given the fast- changing skill needs but also the aging of many economies' workforces. As the old career path of \"learn- work- retire\" gives way to one of continuous learning, the availability and quality of continuing education must be dramatically scaled up. This will demand innovations in the content, delivery, and financing of training, including new models for public- private partnerships. It will involve experimentation, and learning from what works, such as the apprenticeship system in Germany. The po - tential of technology- enabled solutions, such as online learning platforms, must be harnessed through investing in broader digital access and im - proved digital literacy. Reducing the digital divide is a big new challenge for equity. Education is a power ful equalizer of economic opportunity. Inequali - ties in education start at a young age and are magnified in adulthood. From early childhood education to higher education and training programs, a strong commitment to promoting inclusion of the eco nom ically disadvan - taged is vital. In a knowledge- based economy, broad- based access to afford - able and quality education, including skills upgrading and retraining, will be increasingly impor tant for both boosting productivity and improving equity. Revamping Labor Market Policies and Social Protection A fourth area of reform is the overhaul of labor market policies and social protection arrangements to adapt them to the changing world of work char - acterized by more frequent shifts between jobs and more people working in de pen dently. The focus should shift from backward- looking labor market policies such as restrictive job protection laws that seek to keep workers in Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 25 existing jobs to forward- looking policies that improve workers' ability to change jobs. The latter include innovations in unemployment/wage insur - ance mechanisms that encourage re- employment and active labor market policies such as retraining and placement ser vices. Reform of backward- looking policies has par tic u lar relevance for Eu ro pean economies. Advanced economies, in general, need to do more and better on forward- looking policies. Reform should also address other barriers to worker mobility and com - petition in labor markets, such as the ever- increasing professional licensing requirements and non- compete covenants in worker contracts.23 Well- functioning labor market institutions\u2014 collective bargaining, minimum wage laws, labor standards\u2014 are impor tant to ensure that workers get a fair share of economic returns, especially at a time of rising market power of dominant firms. Social contracts, traditionally based on formal long- term employer- employee relationships, will need to be overhauled, with benefits such as retirement and health care made more portable and adapted to evolving work arrangements, including increasing in de pen dent work. There is cur - rently an active debate on the options to reform social security systems. Pro - posals range from mechanisms such as a universal basic income24 or a negative income tax to vari ous types of social security accounts that pool workers' social benefits and are portable across all jobs. Learning from this debate and experimentation should help inform and guide policy. Reform options will need to be considered in a context where social security sys - tems already face challenges to ensure their long- term fiscal sustainability. Approaching reforms of job protection laws, active labor market poli - cies, and social protection as a package will have the advantage of captur - ing reform synergies and would ease the adjustment for workers. Current reforms in France provide an example, combining reforms to stringent job protection laws with innovations such as a portable \"personal activity ac - count\" that enables workers to accrue rights to training across multiple jobs and types of work. Reviving Investment in Infrastructure A fifth area of reform is underpinning economies with a stronger infra - structure foundation. Driven by fiscal constraints as well as suboptimal 26 productive equity policy choices, public infrastructure investment has been declining, con - tributing to mounting infrastructure gaps. At the same time, technology is transforming infrastructure needs, from new digital infrastructure to en - ergy and transport. In the United States, net federal infrastructure invest - ment recently has been close to zero. In advanced economies as a group, real public capital stock declined from around 70 percent of GDP in the early 1980s to below 60 percent in 2013 (Adler and others 2017). Infrastruc - ture gaps are even larger in emerging economies. Well- designed infrastruc - ture proj ects that fill critical gaps\u2014 and are responsive to and complement new technologies\u2014 can offer high returns in boosting productivity and broadening economic opportunity. Fiscal policy needs to be more innova - tive in creating space for such high- return investments, especially when borrowing costs are low. Innovations in developing infrastructure as an asset class, risk mitigation, and public- private partnerships, together with improved regulatory ecosystems, can help mobilize more private invest - ment in infrastructure. Stable, long- term returns provided by infrastruc - ture assets should be attractive to institutional investors. Yet only about 5 percent of the $120 trillion in assets under management by institutional investors globally is currently invested in infrastructure (Bielenberg and others 2016). Sound infrastructure investments are central to combating climate change and ensuring the longer- term sustainability of gains in economic productivity as well as social equity. Infrastructure currently contributes around 60 percent of global green house gas emissions. New infrastructure investments must be designed to support environmental sustainability. The key action here is to institute carbon pricing, which would shift incentives toward sustainable forms of infrastructure and could also raise substantial revenues. Revenue raised from carbon taxation can support investment in sustainable infrastructure; it can also be put to other desirable uses de - pending on country circumstances, such as paying down national debt and improving longer- term fiscal sustainability. Shifting to sustainable in - frastructure can open a new world of opportunities for innovation and investment, notably in energy- related sectors, that can boost productivity and growth (Bhattacharya and others 2016). Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 27 Improving the Efficiency and Equity of Tax Systems A sixth area is reforming tax systems. Tax policy is often seen as present - ing trade- offs between efficiency and growth on one hand and equity on the other\u2014 and trade- offs do exist\u2014 but there are win- win opportunities for reform. Reducing the tax wedge for low- wage workers through greater use of options such as earned- income tax credit can boost incentives to work and labor force participation as well as improve distributional outcomes. The changing nature of work driven by digital technologies will require more attention to efficiently and equitably taxing workers in di ff er ent types of work arrangements. Labor income is often taxed at much higher rates than capital income, which can entail both efficiency costs, by distorting investment and employment decisions, and equity costs. For example, bi - ases in the tax code in favor of capital may be creating incentives toward \"excessive automation\" (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018a). Policy should seek to tax di ff er ent types of capital income more neutrally. Tax systems in many OECD economies include differential taxation of types of capital income, assets, and financing (favoring debt over equity), which distorts investor incentives. Given the mobility of capital, international cooperation is impor tant for taxing capital more effectively, even more so in today's dig - ital economy. Partly driven by international competition for mobile capital, the recent trend in corporate income taxation has been to lower tax rates, most re - cently in the United States as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This is happening in a period when corporate profits have soared. The sharp rise in pure corporate profits or rents, approaching an estimated one- fifth of in - come in the U.S. economy, as already noted, suggests that it may be opti - mal to tax corporate profits at relatively high rather than low rates. Making better use of wealth taxes can improve both the efficiency and equity of the tax structure. Wealth taxes are underutilized and have not kept pace with the surge in wealth; in major economies with available data, the effective tax rate on di ff er ent types of wealth fell from an average of around 0.9 percent in 1970 to 0.5 percent in the early 2010s (Clements and others 2015). High wealth in equality is a key driver of intergenerational per sis tence of income in equality. Thomas Piketty's work on in equality (Piketty 2014) has attracted much controversy, but one key proposal\u2014to find a better way to tax wealth\u2014 certainly has merit. The wealth dynamics of the past 28 productive equity few de cades paint a picture of private riches and public poverty. While private wealth has soared, public wealth has declined, arguably hobbling the capacity of public policy to play its due role in promoting a more sus - tainable and inclusive pattern of growth.25 Better taxation of private wealth must be part of the agenda of tax and expenditure reforms to restore gov - ernment capacities to pursue desirable public policy goals. Income tax progressivity has declined steeply in major economies. There is scope to recover some of the lost progressivity without hampering eco - nomic growth (IMF 2017b). This does not necessarily mean sharply raising marginal tax rates. A more efficient way is to reform the assortment of regres - sive and distortive tax expenditures that characterize most tax systems\u2014 and curb tax avoidance and evasion.26 Also, the redistributive impact of taxes depends crucially on how the programs they finance promote equity objectives\u2014 such as education and social programs already mentioned. Re - form should be guided by the overall progressivity of the tax and expendi - ture system. It is not just that well- designed fiscal re distribution may not be inimical to growth; it can even be pro- growth (Ostry and others 2014). The International Context Despite globalization and increased economic spillover effects across na - tional borders, the nation- state remains the primary locus for formulating policies that affect productivity, growth, and income distribution. The in - ternational context increasingly matters, however. National economic policies and international rules governing trade, investment, and flows of skills and technology must work well in concert to ensure that globaliza - tion delivers for all. The interface between national and international policies can produce tensions, as is evident in the currently charged debate on globalization and major recent po liti cal developments where popu lar reactions against glo - balization played a prominent role, such as Brexit and the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Protectionist pressures, and actions, have been on the rise. Such tensions are captured well in Dani Rodrik's \"po liti- cal trilemma of the world economy\" that points to the difficulty of recon - ciling national sovereignty, demo cratic policymaking, and global economic integration (Rodrik 2011). The trilemma leads to \"the globalization paradox\": Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 29 globalization boosts economic prosperity but works best when it is not pushed too far for its own sake but managed through international disci - plines that ensure fair play and is complemented by the preservation of adequate policy space for the nation- state. Well- managed globalization within these par ameters can stand up better against assault by ascendant national pop u lism. A Better, More Inclusive Globalization International trade and investment are impor tant drivers of productivity growth. A retreat into protectionism would be counterproductive. \"Mer - cantilism redux\" is not the way forward. Already, growing protectionism, neglect of fresh liberalization, and barriers to investment have contributed to the slowing of international trade and investment, weighing down global productivity and growth. At the same time, it is crucial for both produc - tivity and equity that the rules that govern trade and investment are fair, in that they provide a level playing field for competition and promote the free flow of ideas and innovation rather than allow the reinforcement of new monopolistic tendencies in the world economy. As traditional tariffs have been lowered across the world in past trade deals, particularly in manufac - turing, trade negotiations are increasingly focused on \"behind- the- border\" regulatory issues going well beyond tariffs and traditional nontariff barri - ers. On one hand, domestic regulations should not be allowed to replace traditional protectionism as countries attempt to protect their firms against competition. On the other hand, country circumstances and citizen pref - erences differ, and this needs to be respected. Striking the right balance between regulatory harmonization and diversity will be a challenge for policymakers. Enhancing competition that is open and fair is a key issue. Simply im - posing regulatory systems from one part of the world onto others may be seen as a ploy to provide competitive advantage to the former. The huge profits being made by today's multinational giants in part reflects the mono - poly power arising from scale, first- mover advantages, and winner- takes- most markets associated with the new technologies.27 Economies of scale in themselves are a productivity- enhancing factor. If they lead to monopolistic global market structures, however, these structures will, in the longer run, reduce productivity growth by restricting competition. The implications for 30 productive equity income distribution are prob ably even more serious. Overly stringent and broad intellectual property protections add to the forces driving increased market concentration. Appropriate regulation of intellectual property rights acquires increased importance in the knowledge economy to foster broader opportunities for innovation and its diffusion. The biggest challenge for future international policies will be how to strike the most desirable balance on regulatory issues so that competition and innovation are enhanced and how di ff er ent national preferences are reconciled with the need for a global framework that responds to the challenges of the digital age. Trade has always created winners and losers (Rodrik 2017). The winners could, hypothetically, compensate the losers as long as net gains are posi - tive. In practice, the losers often are not compensated, which explains their negative reaction to trade liberalization without compensation. Policymak - ers should address this issue much more seriously than they have in the past. Of course one can argue that most dynamic economic change creates winners and losers and, indeed, the issue is much wider than just the dis - tributional consequences of trade. Much depends on how losses are con - centrated rather than diffused sectorally and geo graph i cally and over large numbers. When they strongly affect par tic u lar sectors or regions, as they often do, the consequences of trade liberalization deserve par tic u lar atten - tion. In the future, this may also become the case with the speed and spread of digitization. Trade liberalization needs to be complemented with domes - tic policies to help those affected adjust to change and to support them through the transition. This reinforces the importance of policies related to skill retraining and social protection discussed in the previous section. Demographic and technological change and their implications for labor supply and demand have brought migration issues more to the fore, but pol - icy responses and coordination mechanisms have lagged. Gains in aggre - gate welfare from labor mobility can dwarf the benefits from trade given the large income differences between countries. There is growing evidence of the role of mi grants in boosting productivity, through mitigating the im - pact of population aging, alleviating skill supply and demand imbalances, transferring technology, spurring innovation and entrepreneurship, and fostering cross- border trade, investment, and knowledge networks (IMF 2016, McKinsey Global Institute 2016). There are, however, clear cultural factors that constitute a barrier to large- scale migration, in addition to is - sues related to income distribution. Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 31 National preferences on immigration differ and need to be respected. On the other hand, given the potential gains from migration, an interna - tional system that incentivizes it, while respecting national priorities, is desirable. One way forward, for example, could be a system of national quo - tas to accept mi grants based on agreed par ameters that are tradable among countries and, thereby, accommodate national preferences (Fern\u00e1ndez- Huertas Moraga and Rapoport 2014). This is being explored in Eu rope as an option to address the refugee issue. It could, however, be considered on a more global scale among interested countries for certain types of mi - grants, such as those seeking temporary work visas. With deeper global integration, skilled migration is likely to increasingly involve shorter dura - tions and circular paths as opposed to one- way and long- duration moves. To facilitate temporary cross- border movements of skilled workers, one proposal is to work through the General Agreement on Trade in Ser vices (GATS) and establish a plurilateral but open \"innovation zone\" within which technical personnel could move freely over periods spanning a cer - tain number of years (Doherty and others 2016).28 With globalization increasing the mobility of capital and making it easier to shift income and assets to offshore lower- tax jurisdictions, international cooperation on tax matters takes on added significance. Tax avoidance and evasion from such tax arbitrage and often- outright concealment of income and wealth in offshore havens distorts investment decisions, erodes fiscal capacities, and exacerbates in equality.29 International tax com - petition threatens a race to the bottom in the taxation of capital. Differences in national preferences on tax policy should be respected, but a system that undermines each nation's ability to tax, leading to a situation akin to a prisoner's dilemma, with lack of cooperation resulting in lower tax reve - nues than desired by any nation, should be avoided. The G20, supported by the OECD, has recently launched initiatives to facilitate exchange of in - formation on financial assets and to curb tax- base erosion and profit shift - ing (OECD 2017b). Given implementation challenges, and new challenges arising from fast- expanding digital commerce, this is easier said than done.30 But at least a start has been made. Another area for stronger international cooperation is carbon taxation and other policies to tackle climate change\u2014 the \" mother of all global pub - lic goods.\" The Paris Agreement on climate change was an impor tant step. While it may not at the outset provide a sufficient degree of ambition, it was 32 productive equity the first truly global agreement on climate action, until the United States pulled out a year later. Tackling climate change is crucial to longer- term sus - tainable growth in economic productivity as well as to inclusive growth, as lower- income groups typically are more vulnerable to its impacts. As with trade, however, and particularly in the short run, climate policies can pro - duce winners and losers. That is why mea sures to ease adjustment and ad - dress distributional effects\u2014as well as support poor countries on climate actions\u2014 must be an integral part of climate policies (Commission on Car - bon Prices 2017). Global Institutions for the Twenty- First Century A crosscutting challenge at the global level is to ensure that global markets are \"embedded\"\u2014 following John Ruggie's well- known terminology\u2014in rules and institutions that help them work efficiently, fairly, and equitably (Ruggie 2008). While much has been built in the past few de cades, global institutional frameworks have not kept pace with the increasing integra - tion of global markets (OECD 2017c). Looking ahead, technological change will pose new challenges as policies attempt to catch up with expanding digital trade; the rise of \"the intangi - ble economy\" with more knowledge- intensive investment and commerce; multinational technology giants that affect competition across national markets; and issues of data privacy and cyber security.31 In this world of digital globalization and global value chains, where multinational corpo - rations account for about 80 percent of world trade, issues relating to in - ternational trade, investment, competition, and intellectual property rights are increasingly intertwined. Yet the world lacks a multilateral insti - tutional framework to address these issues in a holistic, coordinated way (Baldwin 2016). The WTO's current mandate is focused primarily on trade. It needs to be broadened. While today's backlash against globalization threatens to weaken the WTO, the institution, in fact, needs to be strength - ened to anchor an updated, open, and fair rules- based system to make glo - balization work better. Absent a multilateral framework, groups of countries have attempted to address this evolving and interlinked agenda of trade, investment, com - petition, and intellectual property in regionally negotiated arrangements. Some regional agreements have also included provisions on labor standards. Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 33 Innovations through these regional initiatives can help in developing rules and practices that incrementally lead to wider adoption and application. Major economies working through the G20 can also play a facilitating role on this forward agenda. In today's po liti cal climate, strengthening global institutional frameworks appears especially daunting. Eventually, however, there will be a need to adapt multilateral frameworks to the demands of the twenty- first century. The governance and modus operandi of international institutions would benefit from improvements to enhance their po liti cal legitimacy and effi - ciency of decisionmaking. This includes how nation- states are represented and engage in these institutions\u2014 their voice and accountability\u2014 and how decisions are taken among a large number of members of di ff er ent size. In the case of the WTO, for example, where decisions by consensus may be difficult, plurilateral approaches could be considered that are open to others to opt in later (IMF and others 2017). In the case of some other institutions, notably the IMF and multilateral development banks, the system of weighted voting seems to work well. If we want to achieve productive equity, we will need to harness the forces of globalization and technological change so that they promote a bet - ter world for all. Nation- states will be the primary actors in this effort, but some degree of \"global civics\" (Altinay 2011) will be necessary, as reflected in fit- for- purpose global institutions. Notes 1. This is sometimes termed \"the Solow Paradox\" in reference to Robert Solow's quip, \"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics\" (Solow 1987). 2. Past episodes of high and per sis tent in equality have typically been followed by po liti cal upheavals or other shocks to the system that Walter Scheidel (2017) calls the \"Four Horse men of Leveling,\" namely: wars, po liti cal revolution, state col - lapse, and pandemics. 3. Frontier firms in this estimate are defined as the top 5 percent of firms with the highest labor productivity within each two- digit industry. Non- frontier firms cover all other firms. The estimate covers firms in twenty- four OECD countries, operating in manufacturing and business ser vices (excluding financial ser vices) and employing twenty or more workers. 4. Productivity statistics based on GDP by definition do not include the con - sumer surplus. However, research finds that even when a reasonable allowance is 34 productive equity made for the higher consumer surplus associated with digital products, such as Internet- linked ser vices, the data still show a slowdown in productivity. For an overview of the mea sure ment debate, see Dervi and Qureshi (2016). 5. Actual levels of in equality may be even greater than the mea sured ones given the potential for underestimation of income and wealth at the top end of the distribution. 6. At the global level, forty- two people own as much wealth as the bottom 3.7 billion people, almost one- half of the global population (Credit Suisse 2017). 7. Krugman (2016) terms this period a \"robber baron era,\" and the stagnation of economic activity resulting from increased mono poly power and its effects of dampening investment and productivity \"robber baron recessions.\" 8. See, for example, \"Digitalization and the New Guilded Age,\" http:// www . imf . org Meetings / SeminarDetails . aspx ? SeminarId =295. 9. Research also finds some evidence that changing composition of stock owner ship with increasing shares held by financial institutions, in par tic u lar large institutional investors, played a role by shifting corporate decisionmaking toward short- termism, favoring more immediate financial gains (such as through stock buybacks) at the expense of longer- term investments in innovation and new capacity (Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon 2016). Institutional investors now hold more than two- thirds of the stock of U.S. publicly traded companies\u2014up from about one- third in 1980. 10. In the United States, net business investment declined from above 50 percent of net operating surplus in the early 1980s to below 25 percent in the first half of 2010s (Egerttsson and others 2018). 11. McKinsey (2018) estimates that slowing growth of capital per hour worked because of lower investment accounts for about half of the decline in labor pro - ductivity growth in the United States and major Western Eu ro pean economies be - tween 2000-04 and 2010-14. 12. \"Too many potential physicists and engineers spend their careers shifting money around in the financial sector, instead of applying their talents to innovat - ing in the real economy\" (Barack Obama, \"The Way Ahead,\" The Economist, Oc- tober 8, 2016). 13. Consistent with Kaldor's stylized facts (Kaldor 1957), the labor income share had been relatively stable over several preceding de cades. 14. The role of uneven wealth owner ship and returns on wealth as sources of in equality has been particularly emphasized by Thomas Piketty in his 2014 best - seller (Piketty 2014). 15. IMF (2017a) finds that, in advanced economies, technology accounts for about half of the decline in the labor income share. Global integration is estimated to have contributed about half as much as technology. 16. OECD Employment Database. Booming Technology, Slowing Productivity, and Rising Inequality 35 17. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. 18. The negative relationship between income in equality and intergenerational mobility is often referred to as the \" Great Gatsby Curve,\" a name coined by Alan Krueger. 19. In the United States, for example, middle- income house holds declined from 58 percent to 47 percent of total house hold population between 1970 and 2014 (Alici and others 2016). A recent work (Temin 2017) provides a particularly detailed and illuminating account of the middle- class squeeze in the country. 20. The redistributive impact of fiscal policy is typically much smaller in emerg - ing economies because of lower levels of taxes and transfers. In 2015, for twenty- nine emerging economies with available data, the average Gini coefficient was 0.49 for market income and 0.45 for disposable income (IMF 2017b). 21. See Stiglitz (2015) for a similar conclusion: \"The new research and thinking that has emerged suggests that equality and economic per for mance are in fact com - plementary rather than opposing forces. No more false choices.\" 22. Recent examples include the Internet, Google's basic search algorithm, and key features of Apple smartphones (Mazzucato 2015). 23. In the United States, almost one in three workers requires a government occupational license (CEA 2016). Non-compete restrictions cover between 20 percent to 25 percent of all workers, with the ratio rising for higher- level occupations\u2014 about 40 percent for engineers and 70 percent for business execu - tives (Shambaugh and Nunn 2018). 24. Pi lots of universal basic income are currently under way or in the works in Finland and some subnational jurisdictions such as Ontario, Canada, and Oak - land and Stockton, California. The Finland pi lot will end in 2018, and its results will become available in late 2019. 25. The World In equality Report 2018, led by Piketty and others, estimates that most major economies experienced this pattern of rising private wealth and de - clining public wealth. In the United States, for example, while net private wealth (or private capital) increased from 326 percent of national income in 1970 to about 500 percent in 2015, net public wealth fell from 36 percent to -17 percent. Net wealth is mea sured as assets minus debt (Alvaredo and others 2017). 26. A recent study of rich economies estimates that the super- rich evade about 30 percent of their taxes compared with an average evasion rate of 3 percent for the whole population (Alstads\u00e6ter and others 2017). 27. Eight multinational technology companies account for about one- third of the market capitalization of the world's 100 most valuable firms (Wolf 2017). 28. Mode 4 of WTO's GATS covers cross- border movement of persons. 29. Wealth held in offshore tax havens is estimated to have risen to the equiva - lent of more than 10 percent of global GDP (Alstads\u00e6ter and others 2017). This may be a conservative estimate.36 productive equity 30. While most big companies can use financial engineering to offshore profits, companies based on intangibles, such as Internet protocol, rather than traditional tangible goods can do it more easily. Among these are U.S.- based technology plat - form companies such as Apple, Google, and Facebook. Their growing heft and offshoring ability means that half of all U.S. corporate profits from overseas are now located in tax havens such as Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Switzer - land, and Jersey ( Financial Times , February 17, 2018). 31. Just fifteen years ago, cross- border digital flows were almost non ex is tent; today, they have a larger impact on global economic growth than traditional flows of traded goods. The volume of cross- border data flows has soared forty- five- fold since 2005, and is expected to grow another nine- fold over the next five years (Tyson and Lund 2017).

January 2018 (Washington, D.C.).43TWO The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income In equality KARIM FODA In the fall of 2016, eight years after the global financial crisis, the manag - ing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned the G20 that the world economy risked slipping into a trap of low growth and high in - come in equality. It had taken the advanced economies longer to recover from the loss of output from the crisis than the recoveries of any recession since the Great Depression. Yet even after GDP recovered, the growth en - gine remained stuck in low gear. Wishful outlooks for faster growth were consistently scaled back with each data update until late 2016. Higher in - come in equality, which in some countries had grown to levels not seen since before the Great Depression, were stubbornly difficult to reverse, as the chances for people to move up the income ladder were eroding. Emerging and developing economies had at first quickly recovered from the setback of the crisis, contributing nearly 90 percent of global growth from 2008 to 2011, but eventually began to lose steam. As the leaders of the G20 countries gathered in Hangzhou, China, in the fall of 2016, the global economy seemed to be, by most accounts, sliding into a trap of low growth and high income in equality\u2014 enough reason for the IMF to sound the alarm bells. One year later, the global economy appeared to be on a cyclical upswing, but the main driver of longer- term growth\u2014 productivity\u2014 remained asleep at the wheel.44 productive equity Without a revival in productivity growth, there is little expectation of sustained growth in the future and, therefore, less incentive for firms to invest in the future. This further slows down productivity growth in a some - what vicious cycle. The result could very well be a low growth trap, rein - forced by wide disparities that have emerged within many countries around the world. This chapter outlines the under lying trends for growth and in equality across both developed and developing economies over the last thirty years. Next is a review of the recent growth challenge in a longer- run context to provide perspective, then an illustration of the changes and patterns in the ultimate driver of longer- term economic growth: productivity. Last, the chapter turns to the evolution of income in equality, both within countries and between them. The Era of Economic Growth For hundreds and, perhaps, thousands of years, economic growth was es - sentially nil. Human pro gress had resulted in discoveries and inventions that gave rise to civilization, science, architecture, and engineering before the Industrial Revolution, yet the size of an economy could grow only as fast as its population.1 This changed with the technological breakthroughs of the first industrial revolution in the late eigh teenth and early nine - teenth centuries. The invention of the steam engine replaced human and animal power with machine power, enabling workers to produce far more than they ever had in traditional agricultural socie ties. These new tech - nologies and methods of production enabled workers to be significantly more productive. For the first time in recorded history, productivity began to grow, and the era of economic growth was born. The second in - dustrial revolution, around the turn of the twentieth century, had an even greater impact on productivity and growth. Electric power, internal com - bustion engines, chemical production, and other technologies launched a wave of productivity growth that originated in the United States and even - tually spread to Eu rope and Japan after World War II (Bergaud, Cette, and Lecat 2014). Between 1920 and 1970, average incomes in the United States qua dru- pled, and prosperity was widespread. Growing manufacturing industries The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income Inequality 45 created stable and well- paying jobs; rising numbers of high school and col - lege gradu ates had the right skills; and government policies strengthened the bargaining power of labor and widened the social safety net. In Eu rope and Japan, pent-up demand after years of war and austerity combined with a wave of productivity- enhancing innovations, many of which arrived from the United States, and drove rapid, sustained, and widespread growth. In the post- war de cades from 1951 to 1973, the world economy grew at an im - pressive annual rate of nearly 5 percent (Levinson 2017). In the early 1970s, however, the prosperous years of rapid growth in the West appeared to be over. Rapid productivity growth in the United States did not recover after the shock of the oil crisis in 1973 and, with the excep - tion of the information technology boom years of 1996 to 2004, has re - mained relatively slow. In Eu ro pean countries and Japan, still in the pro cess of catching up to the United States, productivity growth decelerated and has continued on a general downward trend through today (figure 2-1). Beyond the West, economic reforms in East Asia and the opening of China to the world economy in the 1970s laid the foundations for faster growth in the developing world.

Labor productivity in terms of output per hour worked.46 productive equity technologies that enabled global value chains to spread helped lift productiv - ity and economic growth in many emerging economies. In 1980, developing countries accounted for about one-quarter of world output and 85 percent of the world's population. By 2015, their share of world output increased to 40 percent (58 percent under purchasing power parity), though their ability to sustain such rapid pro gress is in question as they, too, are losing steam. The Recent Low Growth Challenge Since the global financial crisis, the pace of economic growth and its longer- term drivers drove the IMF managing director to warn the G20 of a low growth trap. In advanced economies, overall GDP growth from 2008 to 2017 fell to 1.2 percent a year, a full percentage point below its longer- term average since 1990 and less than half of the pre- crisis average of 2.7 percent. On a per capita basis, growth fell below its longer- term average by half, down to 0.7 percent a year in 2008-17 compared to 1.5 percent since 1990. In emerging and developing economies, overall growth has remained around the longer- term average of 5 percent since the crisis, though it has been steadily decelerating in recent years down to nearly 4 percent. On a per capita basis, growth in emerging and developing countries has fallen to 3.5 percent in 2008-17 compared to 3.8 percent since 1990. At the core of today's low growth challenge is the widespread slowdown in labor productivity growth. \"Labor productivity\" (a term used interchange - ably with \"productivity\") can be mea sured in terms of either output per person employed or output per hour worked. It depends on two key ingre - dients. One is how much capital is available per worker, like machinery for welding, computers for programming, or office space to work in. The other is how efficiently all the inputs are used together, which is what economists call total factor productivity (TFP). TFP is where the less observable but often most impor tant characteristics of economic growth come in. It cap - tures the knowledge, innovation, and technological pro gress embodied in the production of goods and ser vices. Labor and capital are the inputs, but the ingenuity and know- how in combining labor and capital to create a final product is often what matters most, especially when new information, knowledge, and technologies are used to make workers more efficient. These three components of productivity\u2014 labor, capital, and TFP\u2014 can be taken together to come up with an estimate of how much an economy is The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income Inequality 47 capable of producing at a sustained rate, what economists call potential out - put. In other words, potential output can be estimated by knowing the amount of production inputs in an economy and how efficiently they work together. Over the last few de cades, potential output growth in both ad - vanced and emerging economies has been slowing down (figure 2-2). In other words, not only has actual GDP growth slowed down, but its poten - tial has, too, as shown by the ingredients of productivity. The contributions of labor and TFP growth have declined across both advanced and emerging economies. On labor, shifting demographics are posing a significant challenge for growth. According to the UN's World Population Ageing report, older persons (over age sixty) are the fastest- growing age group in the world (United Nations 2015). The aging pro cess is most advanced in developed countries. Though some developing coun - tries, like India, currently have a large and growing workforce of younger people, the pace of population aging in the developing world is substantially faster than has occurred in developed countries in the past.2 On the contribution of capital, the notable decline in advanced economies is partly explained by the shock to investment from the global financial crisis. The slower accumulation of capital also hinders total factor productivity 0.51.01.52.0 2001-07Average percentage change, annual Advanced economies Emerging market economies Average percentage change, annual 2008-14 Labor Capital TFP Labor Capital TFP2001-07 2008-141234567 Source: IMF World Economic Outlook (2015) April.FIGURE 2-2 The Evolution of Potential Output Growth and Its Components48 productive equity growth because efficiency gains and technological pro gress are often em - bodied in capital itself (more on that later). Emerging market economies had at first increased investment in response to the global financial crisis, but they, too, slowed down in later years. Holding all else constant, the impact of slowing total factor productiv - ity growth, lackluster investment growth, and aging populations will con - tinue to place a drag on potential output growth and exacerbate the low growth challenge. Projections by the World Bank suggest a continued de - cline in potential growth in the de cade ahead, led by a continued slowdown in labor, capital, and TFP (figure 2-3) (World Bank Global Economic Pros - pects, January 2018). In an era of aging populations in most advanced economies and some large emerging economies, increasing investment in capital and raising TFP are necessary to boost potential output and labor productivity. One can - not escape the need to spark productivity growth if one is to have any chance of tackling the longer- term low growth challenge facing the global econ - omy. The task is a tall one, however, because the slowdown in productivity growth has been under way for some time.FIGURE 2-3 Projections for Potential Output Growth and Its Components 0.20.40.60.81.01.21.41.61.8Average percentage change, annualAdvanced economies Emerging market and developing economies Average percentage change, annua l 1998-2017 2018-27 TFP Capital Labor TFP Capital Labor1998-2017 2018-2712345 Source: World Bank (2018). The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income Inequality 49 The Productivity Slump Today, popu lar debate around the productivity slowdown often begins with the shock of the financial crisis in 2008. Part of the puzzle definitely in - cludes the lackluster recovery since the crisis, which was, indeed, the turning point for emerging and developing economies. In advanced economies, how - ever, the productivity slowdown began before the crisis (figure 2-4). Let us first observe what has been happening to productivity growth in the devel - oped world\u2014 whose proximity to the technological frontier raises a di ff er ent set of questions\u2014 before turning to emerging and developing economies. Advanced Economies Grouping the advanced economies into one group suggests that the most recent slowdown in productivity growth began in 2004. A closer look, how - ever, reveals a more nuanced picture. As described, though productivity growth in Eu ro pean countries and Japan began to slow down in the 1970s, it was still growing faster than in -10123456 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Average percentage change, annual Emerging and developing AdvancedFIGURE 2-4 A Global Overview of Labor Productivity Growth, 1990-2016 Source: The Conference Board. Labor productivity in terms of output per person employed.50 productive equity the United States until the mid-1990s. At that time, the spread of the Inter - net and the rise of information and communication technologies (ICT) in the United States launched a wave of productivity growth (Bergaud, Cette, and Lecat 2014; McKinsey Global Institute 2018). As the United States began to pull away in the mid-1990s, productivity growth in other advanced econ - omies continued to slow. Only later did other advanced economies begin to adopt these technologies, but with less impact on productivity than in the United States (see chapter 4). In 2004, less than one de cade later, the ICT- led wave of productivity growth in the United States had waned. The result is a \"rise and fall\" wave of productivity growth in the United States over the last three de cades. Since then, the productivity slowdown has been widespread across most major advanced economies (figure 2-5). What is behind the widespread slowdown in productivity growth? Is it driven by declining efficiency or by less new capital for workers to work with? Breaking down labor productivity growth into its two key ingredients\u2014 growth in capital per worker and total factor productivity growth\u2014 reveals that a widespread slowdown of TFP growth has been behind much of the productivity slowdown (figure 2-6). In the midst of rapid technological change, this has left many econo - mists scratching their heads in confusion. TFP captures the technologi - cal pro gress, knowledge, and innovation in the production of goods and ser vices. Though rapid TFP growth led the ICT- led wave of productivity growth in the United States, it also led the subsequent slowdown. In most other advanced economies, TFP has also played the dominant role in driv - ing slower labor productivity growth. A passionate debate has emerged around the paradox of rapid techno - logical pro gress but slow productivity growth. Some argue that today's innovations are just not as impactful as those of the past, while others argue that we are on the cusp of a far- reaching technological revolution led by digital technologies and artificial intelligence. Dany Bahar and Karim Foda unpack this debate in chapter 4 with pos si ble explanations for why this par - adox exists. The contribution of capital also has played a role in the widespread productivity slowdown. The shock to investment from the financial crisis drastically reduced the pace of the capital accumulation in the post- crisis years. The total capital stock in the United States grew half as fast after the crisis as it had in the de cade before, falling from 3 percent a year in FIGURE 2-5 Labor Productivity Growth in Advanced Economies 0.51.01.52.02.5 UK Euro AreaFranceGermanyItalySpainSwedenAustraliaCanada1990-95 1996-2004 2005-16 1990-95 1996-2004 2005-160.51.01.52.02.53.0Average percentage annual Average percentage change, annualEuropean and other advanced economiesMajor advanced economies Advanced United StatesEurope Japan Other Advanced Source: The Conference Board and author's calculations.

In the euro area, growth in capi - tal stock fell from 2.3 percent a year to 1.3 percent a year, and in Japan it collapsed from 2 percent a year to 0.2 percent a year (OECD 2015). The direct impact on labor productivity growth is clear through a lower con - tribution from capital deepening. Less clear is the indirect impact of slower capital accumulation on TFP growth, since technological advances can be embodied in capital itself.3 A Broad- Based Slowdown The productivity slowdown is not only widespread across countries; it is also broad- based across industries. In the United States, although the slowdown was strongest among ICT- related sectors (Fernald 2014), TFP growth slowed down in nearly two- thirds of all industries, ranging from apparel and chemical products to transport and waste management. On the flip side, when productivity growth sped up in the mid-1990s, the same share of industries sped up too (figure 2-7). The ICT- led wave of produc - tivity growth carried most boats with it; most of the industries that sped up in 1996-2004 were the same ones that slowed down afterward (Baily and Montalbano 2016). Only the information and finance, insurance, and real estate sectors defied the slowdown by speeding up in both periods. In other advanced economies, the productivity slowdown has also been broad- based across a variety of ser vice and manufacturing industries (figure 2-8). But not all industries are equal in terms of their impact on national productivity growth. Changes in larger industries have a larger impact than smaller ones. Manufacturing is of par tic u lar interest, since it has a large influence over growth for the whole economy and is a core source of technological pro gress, accounting for the majority of recorded research and development performed by private business (70 percent in the United States). In the United States, the manufacturing sector contributed 40 percent of the rise in TFP growth in 1996-2004 and over half of the slow - down after 2004. The ser vices sector contributed slightly more than man - ufacturing to the acceleration in TFP but was a relatively minor part of the slowdown (figure 2-9).4 This challenges a common view that the productivity slowdown is a re - sult of growth in the size of the less efficient ser vices sector while the more 54 productive equity productive manufacturing sector is shrinking as a share of total output. Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) did an experiment where they held the size of each industry in the United States constant at 1987 levels to see what aggregate productivity growth would look like if no industry changed in size. The result looked nearly the same as actual productivity growth, FIGURE 2-7 Broad- Based Rise and Fall in the United States: Change in Average Industry TFP Growth Source: BLS and author's calculations.

By now it is clear that there has been a widespread slowdown in pro - ductivity growth under way in advanced economies that predates the global financial crisis in 2008. By historical standards, a brief wave of productiv - ity growth led by rising information and communication technologies oc - curred in the United States between the mid-1990s and the mid-2000s, but FIGURE 2-9 Contributions to the Rise and Fall in U.S. TFP Growth Source: BLS and author's calculations.

Other major advanced econo - mies also benefited from these technologies, but the impact on productiv - ity growth was not as strong as in the United States. Beyond ICT- related sectors, the widespread slowdown of productivity growth across countries has also been observed across industries, revealing the broad- based nature of the slowdown. These facts all come together to show that the productiv - ity slowdown is widespread and broad- based, but a critical questions re - mains: Is it real? Estimating the Gains A crucial question has emerged around the productivity slowdown: Is it real or are the statistics misleading us? The idea that official statistics are not properly mea sur ing recent productivity gains, especially those from new and higher- quality ICT goods and ser vices, is one that has merited a con - siderable amount of attention.5 There are two leading sources of mismea - sure ment that are di ff er ent from other mea sure ment challenges related to non- market ser vices (see Box 2-1). One is that price indices used by national statistics agencies often fail to capture improvements in quality and, there - fore, end up underestimating real output. The other is that an increasing amount of consumer activity is taking place outside the market economy, where free digital ser vices like Wikipedia and Facebook may generate significant consumer surplus and welfare but are outside the scope of pro - duction and output mea sures like GDP. A growing body of research con - firms that productivity growth is underestimated, yet not by enough to ex - plain the slowdown in productivity growth. In other words, the slowdown is real despite challenges in mea sure ment. One of the most difficult yet also most impor tant issues is how to mea - sure quality change to more accurately distinguish between changes in nominal and real mea sures of output. When new or better products are re - corded in the national accounts, the price indices used by national statis - tics agencies to deflate the nominal value of these products tend to be the same price indices used for older or lower- quality products. The result is an underestimated mea sure of real output, thereby underestimating pro - ductivity as well. Economists Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf, in a 2016 Brookings paper, took on this issue and came up with a surprising result. They estimated that the failure of prices to reflect quality changes in ICT 58 productive equity BOX 2-1 Measuring Non- Market Ser vices Most recent research has focused on mea sure ment issues in the ICT industries themselves, but it is pos si ble that unmea sured productiv - ity gains from digital technologies and related innovations are also happening outside these industries, including in non- market ser - vice sectors such as public education and health, where it is already difficult to mea sure productivity. For example, how does one define the productivity of a public school? With inputs from teachers, staff, and supplies, a school tries to produce gradu ates with a certain level of knowledge and core skills. But these outputs are not prod - ucts that are sold in a marketplace, so how is their value mea sured? For public ser vices like education and health care, which in some countries accounts for over a fifth of the economy, output is officially mea sured by total expenditures. Right now, the more you spend on a school, the more \"output\" is recorded. If a school invests in a wide array of new technologies to help boost learning, the bump in productivity comes from the new spending without really knowing if students learned any better. A similar prob lem is true in health care, where health ser vices try to produce healthier patients, but the yardstick used for productivity is on spending rather than patient outcomes.6 The potential for vast improvements in education and health-care delivery are large as new digital technologies improve the quality and efficiency of care and learning. On one hand, efficiencies in these sectors can free up significant resources that can be invested elsewhere. On the other hand, a healthy population and an educa - tion system that develops the right skills, aided and facilitated by new technologies and innovations, are essential for both faster pro - ductivity growth and shared prosperity. The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income Inequality 59 equipment in the United States during the surge period 1996-2004 is actu - ally larger than in 2005-14, when productivity slowed (figure 2-10). The result is an even larger slowdown. Part of this is because domestic production was higher in 1996-2004 than afterward, when imports grew.7 In the end, mismea sure ment was, indeed, a prob lem, yet not one that can explain the slowdown in productivity growth since 2004. More recently, a 2017 paper by Philippe Aghion, Peter Klenow, and others set out to account for mismea sure ment from creative destruction\u2014 the exit of old firms as new ones displace them with better products. They corrected for statistical agencies' use of prices from older surviving prod - ucts to impute inflation from disappearing products, finding that underes - timated output growth accounts for about one- third of true productivity growth. This is a notable amount, but still not large enough to dismiss the slowdown as an illusion.FIGURE 2-10 Adjustments to U.S. Labor Productivity Growth Source: Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016).

But even the largest estimate of consumer surplus in the United States accounts for less than one- third of the missing output resulting from the post-2004 productivity slowdown.9 Certainly not enough to suggest the slowdown is due to a shift in activity beyond the scope of GDP. Emerging and Developing Economies Like advanced economies, slowing productivity growth has also been under way in many emerging and developing economies, making the widespread productivity slowdown a global phenomenon. Unlike in the advanced econ - omies, however, the widespread slowdown of productivity growth in the de - veloping world was triggered by the global financial crisis in 2008. In the post- crisis years, labor productivity growth did not return to the same high pre- crisis growth rates but remained higher than it had been in the 1990s. With the exception of India, this pattern was common across the major emerging and developing economies (figure 2-11). This common experience is an uncommon one by historical standards in this large and diverse group of economies. University of California, Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen and others at the Asian Development Bank and Korea University found that periods of relatively slow productivity growth vary based on a country's level of income and other national charac - teristics, which are more diverse in developing countries than in developed ones. Global factors, like shocks to commodity prices, correlated more strongly with productivity slowdowns in advanced economies than in emerging and developing economies (Eichengreen, Park, and Shin 2015). Less intuitively, TFP growth also decelerated across much of the devel - oping world (figure 2-12). For the most part, developing countries are behind the technological frontier and are less reliant on innovation to drive growth. Diffusion of technological pro gress from the frontier, the strength and quality of institutions, ease of doing business, education and skill levels, and property rights, for example, can go a long way in boosting productivity 02468 Emerging Markets and Developing Economies TFP growth Average percentage change, annualAverage percentage change, annualLabor productivity growth China India Developing AsiaLatin AmericaSub-Saharan AfricaFIGURE 2-11 Productivity Growth in Emerging and Developing Economies, 1990-2016 Source: The Conference Board. Labor productivity is in terms of output per person employed.62 productive equity and economic growth. The pronounced slowdown in TFP growth is, there - fore, a di ff er ent kind of puzzle than in the advanced economies where in - novation is more necessary for growth. Among emerging and developing economies, high investment rates and growth in capital per worker propped up labor productivity growth after the crisis, but the pace of investment has been gradually declining since 2010 (figure 2-13). Slower investment growth reduces the rate of capital accumulation and could also limit the potential for capital- embodied technological change. Technology that is embodied in capital is a key channel of technology transfer from developed to developing countries through trade or foreign direct investment. Emerging and developing economies have made impressive gains in nar - rowing the gap with advanced economies, raising standards of living for millions of people around the world. Through catch-up growth and the adoption of existing technologies and best practices across public and pri - vate sectors, there is ample room for developing countries to improve pro - ductivity and more efficiently allocate existing resources to where they can be most productive. On the other hand, developed countries also can make FIGURE 2-12 A Global Overview of Total Factor Productivity Growth, 1990-2016 Source: The Conference Board.-2-1012 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Percentage change, annual Emerging and developing Advanced The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income Inequality 63 similar efficiency gains within their own economies and support innova - tion and investment. Over the last thirty years, productivity growth around the world has seen some improvements, particularly in the United States and in major emerging and developing economies, like China, that have not been able to be sustained. The waning of the ICT- led wave of productivity growth in the United States and the shock of the financial crisis in developing econo - mies ushered in a period of slowing productivity growth around the world. This challenge of slowing productivity growth is not unique to a par tic u lar country or a par tic u lar type of country that is at or behind the technologi - cal frontier; it is widespread around the world. Evidence in advanced economies shows the slowdown is not unique to any par tic u lar industry, either, but is broad- based. Though mismea sure ment challenges are real and can explain part of the observed slowdown in some countries, they are not large enough to explain the overall trend of a widespread, broad- based, and real productivity slowdown. This is a trend that is related to, as we will now observe, high levels of income in equality in many countries around the world.FIGURE 2-13 Investment Growth in Emerging and Developing Economies, 2010-16 Source: World Bank Global Economic Prospects (2017) January.

In some advanced economies, in - equality has risen to levels last seen nearly a century ago. High income in - equality in a low growth environment can be particularly problematic because it can entrench wide disparities and limit the ability for people to move up, or down, the income ladder\u2014 what economists call economic mobility\u2014 which has, indeed, been the case in many countries. This begs the question as to whether high income in equality is a cause or a symptom of low growth. While this question is the subject of a growing body of eco - nomic lit er a ture too large to cover here, it is impor tant to recognize that the trap of low growth and high in equality reinforce each other. The IMF itself, which has historically stayed away from income distribution issues, due in some extent to its social and po liti cal nature, has found in its more recent research that high in equality can be an impediment to growth (Ostry, Berg, and Tsangarides 2014). Chapter 5 explores the links between slowing productivity growth, high income in equality, and rapid technological change. Here, we explore what has been happening to income in equality in both advanced and emerging and developing economies over the same period used to observe the slowdown in productivity growth. We also take a step back to look at in equality at the global level, as if the whole world were one country. Over the last three de cades, the increased weight of developing countries in the global economy has helped narrow the gap with devel - oped countries despite the fact that the gap between the rich and poor within many developing countries has risen. Higher National In equality Though the overall trend is that many countries around the world have be - come more unequal in the last thirty years, not all countries have had the same experience. Two observations stand out when looking at the Gini co - efficients for major advanced and emerging and developing economies over the last three de cades (figure 2-14).10 The first is that income in equality Source: OECD Income Distribution Database for all advanced economies; UNU- WIDER World Income In equality Database for Latin American countries and Turkey; Standardized World Income In equality Database (Solt 2016) for all other emerging economies.

Among advanced economies, the United States stands out with the highest level of overall income in equality, followed by the United King - dom and the English- speaking world. All the major emerging economies shown in figure 2-14 have higher income inequalities than all the major ad - vanced economies, including the United States. This remains the case even as many emerging economies have seen declines in income in equality in recent years. This leads to the second observation. Income in equality has grown in varying degrees for di ff er ent countries over the last three de cades. In the United States, in equality grew rapidly during the early 1980s and has con - tinued to grow. In equality in the United Kingdom widened dramatically in the 1980s but has changed little since 1990. In France and Germany, in equality rose briefly and modestly. Among emerging and developing economies, in equality also grew but has declined in recent years. Between 1993 and 2008, in equality rose in more than half of the countries in East Asia and the Pacific, in three- quarters of countries in South Asia, and in half of sub- Saharan Africa. After 2008, in equality in major emerging economies held roughly steady. Latin Amer i ca is the only region where the majority of countries reduced in equality since the 1990s (World Bank 2016). Though our focus is on income in equality, it is worthwhile to note that in equality in wealth is significantly higher (figure 2-15). Wealth includes the value of a house hold's assets, like real estate, stocks and bonds, land, and even precious jewelry or art. Though all house holds can accumulate wealth, the wealthiest in most socie ties tend to be those with higher incomes who have more to invest in assets, or those who inherit wealth passed down from earlier generations. Chapter 5 explores the implications this has for in equality of opportunity and economic mobility, which mea sures the ease with which anyone can move up or down the income ladder. Where are the disparities coming from? To answer this question, we need to look at the di ff er ent parts of the income distribution. What we find is that in advanced economies, the rich are pulling away, the middle is hol - lowing out, and the bottom is stagnating. Incomes for the top 10 percent increased by about 40 percent on aggregate in the last twenty years while barely growing at all at the bottom (Lagarde 2016). In emerging and The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income Inequality 67 developing economies, income has also concentrated at the top, but rising average incomes have quite strongly offset the impact on the poor. Figure 2-16 shows two mea sures of income concentration. The first is the 90/10 ratio, which compares incomes of the richest 10 percent (the 90th percentile) to the bottom 10 percent (the 10th percentile). Since the mid-1980s, this ratio has risen for most advanced economies, especially in the United States, but has slightly declined in some major emerging mar - kets. Looking at the top end alone, however, the concentration of income by the richest 1 percent over the last three or more de cades has been wide - spread. The most striking rise occurred in the United States, where the share of the top 1 percent more than doubled from 8 percent in the early 1980s to almost 20 percent in 2012, a level last seen before the Great De - pression. Even more striking is the rise in the amount going to the top 0.1 percent, quadrupling from 2.5 percent to 10.4 percent in the same pe - riod in the United States (all before taxes). Those at the other end of the income distribution had a very di ff er ent ex - perience.

What they found was \"a tale of two countries\" (Piketty, Saez, Zucman 2016a and 2016b). From 1980 to 2014, the average income per adult in the bottom 50 percent did not grow at all, even as income surged at the top. A study by the McKinsey Global Institute finds that between The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income Inequality 69 2005 and 2014, 65 to 70 percent of all house holds in France, Italy, Nether - lands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States, or 400 million people, experienced flat or falling market incomes (McKinsey Global In - stitute 2016). Meanwhile, the strength and size of the middle class eroded. Accord - ing to Branko Milanovic, a leading expert on income in equality, the middle class has shrunk in nearly all advanced economies, though in varying degrees. See figure 2-17 for a sample of the major Western economies. The middle-class squeeze has been the most dramatic in the United States, shrinking from about one- third of the population in 1979 down to 27 percent in 2010. As it became smaller, the economic strength of the middle class also eroded. The share of total national income going to the middle class declined by 5 percentage points in the United States, 4 percentage points in Sweden, Australia, and Netherlands, 3 in Spain, and 1 in Germany (Milanovic 2016). The move away from the middle class has left many countries' income distribution polarized between top and bottom, threatening to divide so - ciety between haves and have- nots. Income polarization is the move away from the middle of the income distribution out into either the higher or lower income groups. According to a recent IMF study, about half of the house holds that exited the middle class in the United States between 1970 and 2014 moved down into lower income groups, while the other half moved up. Before 2000, most of the movement was upward.

Despite more people in the bottom ranks, the share of total national income going to lower income groups did not budge, while the share at the top skyrocketed (Alichi and others 2016).11 Beyond the growing income gap between rich and poor, broader dis - parities that give rise to hopelessness and social unrest are also growing. Research by Carol Graham uses traditional mea sures of income in equality as a point of departure to estimate in equality of well- being, which includes life satisfaction, mortality, and other dimensions of human welfare. In the United States, where the gap between rich and poor has grown the most among advanced economies, Graham finds that the costs of being poor or downwardly mobile are more evident in stress, insecurity, and hopelessness than in material deprivation (Graham 2017a and 2017b). With disappear - ing employment opportunities and stagnant wages for many low- skilled workers, optimism in their futures is fading, as they lack the capacity to plan for or invest in their futures. There is a racial dimension as well that has contributed to further unrest. Prince ton professors Anne Case and Angus Deaton find rising mortality rates since the 1990s among less educated white non- Hispanic Americans despite falling mortality rates among all education classes in most of the rich world. Case and Deaton document a rise in the number of \"deaths of despair\"\u2014 deaths by drugs, alcohol, and suicide\u2014 that is accompanied by a deterioration in economic and social well- being. As the blue- collar eco - nomic heyday of the early 1970s ended, social dysfunction among working- class whites grew and has become more pronounced with each successive age cohort (Case and Deaton 2015 and 2017).12 Lower Global In equality In stark contrast to the hollowing out of the middle in advanced econo - mies, middle classes in emerging and developing economies have thrived. Predominantly in China and emerging Asia, millions of people have joined the ranks of the middle class as emerging and developing economies grow faster than advanced economies. The result has been the emergence of a global middle class as average incomes grew and over a billion people es - caped extreme poverty. The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income Inequality 71 In 2013, Branko Milanovic and Christoph Lakner of the World Bank first published the \"elephant chart\"13 that shows how fast (or slowly) incomes grew for each part of the world, showing an income distribution between 1988 and 2008. The clever \"elephant\" label comes from the S- shape of the chart, a result of high growth rates in the middle part of the distribution (the global middle class), the dip to very low growth in the upper part of the dis - tribution (where the lower middle classes in the advanced economies are), and the spike at the very top among the world's richest. Paul Krugman re - ferred to the elephant chart as \"recent history in one chart\" for how clearly it reveals the dramatic changes to the structure of the global economy (Krug - man 2015). More recently, researchers at the World Income Database ex - tended the elephant chart back to 1980 and forward to 2016 (figure 2-18). In nine of ten cases, the global middle class comprises the middle classes in the fastest-growing emerging Asian economies; predominantly China but also India, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. According to Milanovic, in just the twenty years from 1988 to 2008, average middle-class incomes tri - pled in China's cities and more than doubled in its rural areas (Milanovic 2016). Between 2008 and 2011, when China alone drove nearly half of global GDP growth, average urban incomes in China doubled and rural incomes increased by 80 percent. Such rapid gains in average incomes for a large number of people in the world's most populous country has reinforced the \"global middle,\" which also includes many in India and other countries. De - velopment expert Homi Kharas, at the Brookings Institution, finds that the rate of increase of the global middle class is still growing. By the end of 2016, there were about 3.2 billion people in the middle class, with around 140 million joining every year, potentially rising to 170 million a year by 2022. Alongside rising middle classes in the developing world, a historic re - duction in extreme poverty has also contributed to rising average incomes. Between 1990 and 2013, an astonishing 1.1 billion people escaped extreme poverty ( under $1.90 a day), of which 850 million were from China, East Asia, and the Pacific. In just a little over three de cades, the share of the world's population living in extreme poverty fell from 37 percent (1.8 bil - lion people) to 10.7 percent (797 million people).14 For the first time since the industrial revolution, global in equality began to decline.

Though in equality has risen within many countries, it has fallen between countries. Since the industrial revolution, between- country in - equality assumed the dominant role in increasing global in equality as the industrializing world left the rest behind. According to estimates by Francois Bourguignon and Christian Morrison, between- country in equality accounted for less than 20 percent of global in equality in 1870. By 1980, the same num - ber had grown to 80 percent. Around that time, global in equality itself also approached its peak (Bourguignon and Morrison 2002). Figure 2-19 shows the decline in global in equality since the late 1980s, driven entirely by a de - cline in between- country in equality, thanks to the rapid growth in emerging and developing economies and, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the low growth that engulfed the advanced economies. Not all emerging and developing countries participated in narrowing the gap, however. Led by China and India, who together account for 37 percent of the world's population and 43 percent of the population in developing countries, the rapid growth of income per capita in Asia has been the main source of income convergence between developed index Mean log deviation Within-country Between-country Gini index (right axis) Source: World Bank (2016). on Lakner and Milanovic (2016) and Milanovic (2016).FIGURE 2-19 Global In equality: Between and Within Countries, 1988-201374 productive equity developing economies. Average incomes in Asia rose from 14 percent of the average incomes in developed economies in 1990 to 25 percent in 2014. Exclude Asia, however, and the gap between developed and developing countries barely budged. According to John Page of the Brookings Institu - tion, average per capita income in Africa was about 12 percent of per capita income in developed countries in both 1990 and 2014, despite the \"African Growth Miracle\" of some individual African economies. Per capita in - comes in Latin Amer i ca and the Ca rib bean have remained around 36 percent of the developed countries. Brazil, the region's largest economy, improved its per capita income from 25 percent of the United States to just 28 percent fifteen years later (Page 2016). However, slowing productivity growth is slowing down the overall convergence between developed and developing countries. Absent a re - vival of rapid productivity growth in emerging and developing economies, the outlook for sustained convergence is in doubt. Regardless, the declines in income in equality after 2008 within many emerging and developing economies and the continued decline in between- country in equality, how - ever fast, will continue to put pressure on global in equality. One scenario that could change this would be a revival of productivity growth in the advanced economies. Such a scenario could further scale back the conver - gence of emerging and developing countries unless they also pick up pace. On the other hand, it could also lead to even wider in equality within the advanced economies. Gains from new technologies and innovations could further concentrate income at the top, squeeze the middle class, and leave the poor farther behind. Slow Productivity Growth and High Income In equality The widespread slowdown in productivity growth and high income in - equalities are two defining trends of our time. Together they can reinforce a low- growth trajectory for the world economy. With aging populations and slow investment growth across advanced and many emerging econo - mies, productivity is increasingly impor tant to sustain economic pro - gress. Rapid technological pro gress suggests that productivity should be on a more rapid rise, but the data does not show that this is actually happening. On the contrary, growth has slowed. Bahar and Foda explore The Evolution of Growth, Productivity, and Income Inequality 75 the paradox of rapid technological pro gress and slow productivity growth in chapter 4. Though innovation and technology has been the key to the forward march of economic pro gress, the experience of the industrial revo - lutions in the previous two to three centuries says that this pro cess can take time. The pro cess itself, however, is not always smooth and can result in entrenched disparities between rich and poor. Chapter 5 explores the links between in equality, productivity, and technological pro gress, while chap - ters 6 and 7 discuss policies that can address these challenges. The promise for pro gress is clear, but the real ity on the ground suggests that this promise will not materialize by itself, unaided by policies to help translate techno - logical change into stronger and broadly shared economic gains. Notes 1. Early nineteenth- century British economist Thomas Malthus argued that technological advances can increase the supply of resources and food but would encourage population growth, bringing per capita standards of living back to orig - inal levels. This is known as the Malthusian Trap, which was broken by the pro - ductivity gains from the Industrial Revolution. 2. Of course, what counts for actual growth is the number of workers employed, which can also increase with longer work lives. 3. Consider a new computer with a faster pro cessor that can generate more re - ports and memos than an older model in the same amount of time. Holding all else constant, this computer pro cessor is more productive than its earlier version, thanks to the technological superiority embodied in the newer pro cessor. This kind of technological advancement interacts with the other inputs of production to im - prove overall efficiency in, say, the professional ser vices firm that pres ents such reports to its clients. 4. The outsized role ser vices played in the high- growth years is because the sector went from negative to slightly positive productivity growth. Before 1995, the less efficient ser vice sector subtracted 0.30 percentage points from overall TFP growth in the United States. It then contributed a modest 0.14 percentage points in 1996-2004, implying that its contribution to the increase was 0.44 percentage points (Baily and Montalbano 2016). 5. A number of research programs, conferences, and initiatives have emerged just to deal with productivity mea sure ment issues, including an initiative by the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution that brings together mea sure ment experts from academia and statistical agencies with representatives of the relevant sectors of the business communities. 6. In the case of education, researchers try to mea sure the output of the edu - cation sector as the value of its investment in human capital, or the level of 76 productive equity knowledge, skills, and competencies of students, which depend on lifetime earn - ings and wages of di ff er ent students in di ff er ent fields of studies. There is still a long way to go in ensuring the comparability of these estimates and the ability for national statistics agencies to adopt them (Jorgenson and Fraumeni 1992). 7. This seems true despite mismea sure ment worsening for some types of ICT products, especially as the sector continues to shift from hardware to software (Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf 2016). 8. In some cases, they can push official mea sures of output, like GDP, down. A switch to using a free online encyclopedia like Wikipedia instead of paying to use Britannica, or free calls from Skype instead of a traditional telephone ser vice, or free classifieds like Craigs list instead of newspaper ads, can make billions of dol - lars dis appear from companies' revenues and the GDP statistics (Erik Brynjolffson and Andrew McAfee 2014). 9. The method for the largest estimate is by Austan Goolsbee and Peter Kle - now (2006), from Chad Syverson (2016). 10. This observation is based on house hold income after taxes and transfers (disposable income). Ginis based on market income are notably higher. 11. Alichi and others (2016) use a broader definition of middle class than Mi - lanovic: within 50 percent of median income as opposed to 25 percent used by Milanovic.

After all, economic growth in a country is a reflection of the growth and, in turn, the productivity dynamics among its firms. In what follows, the analysis examines firm- level empirical evidence on productivity and links it to the overall productivity slowdown. The productivity of a firm reflects how efficiently it can convert input into output. For example, imagine an experiment in which two football manufacturing plants are exactly the same in terms of their inputs: same workers, same equipment, and same amount of leather to be used for making the balls. They should be able to make the same number of balls, shouldn't they? In practice, their output might be quite di ff er ent due to differences in productivity. If one of these plants is able to produce more footballs than the other one, then the former is more productive than the latter. This is what economists call Total Factor Productivity: what firms produce after taking into account the factors of production used as inputs This analysis is based on research by Bahar (2018).82 productive equity in the pro cess, such as labor, machinery, and raw materials. Economists cal - culate the productivity of a firm by employing the \"residual\" method: TFP is the difference between the actual output of a firm and its expected out - put given its inputs. In other words, it is the portion of a firm's output that cannot be explained by its inputs. Moses Abramovitz wrote in 1956 that productivity is a \"mea sure of our own ignorance.\"1 In a more intuitive way, a firm is more productive when it adopts new technologies, often embed - ded in new machines or in experienced workers and man ag ers, that allow the firm to do more with the same resources. As firms become more pro - ductive they can produce at lower cost, sell at lower prices, export to for - eign markets, gain more market share, and grow in size and in sales. The slowdown in productivity growth has been recognized by many re - searchers. In the United States the manufacturing sector experienced a considerable slowdown between 2005 and 2015 as compared to the previ - ous de cade. Average annual firm- level TFP growth fell from 2.2 percent in 1995-2004 to 0.4 percent in the following de cade (Syverson 2016). Within the manufacturing sector, the hardest hit was taken by firms manufactur - ing computers and electronics, whose TFP annual growth rate dropped from 10.7 percent during 1995 to 2004 to 3.7 percent from 2005 to 2014. It is argued that the fast- paced productivity growth of firms in the com - puter and electronics sector during 1995 to 2004\u2014 and more broadly, all ICT- using and ICT- producing sectors\u2014is behind the rise in aggregate pro - ductivity for the United States during that same period. Yet, Japan and non- English- speaking Eu ro pean countries seem not to have benefited to the same degree from the vast innovation coming out of this sector, as their overall productivity growth did not accelerate during that period and also suffered from a slowdown in the following de cade. In fact, slow - downs in productivity are observed in the United States and in twenty- four of the twenty- nine countries in the OECD (Syverson 2016), tracing to before the global recession in 2008, which is also consistent with findings in other studies (see Cette, Fernald, and Mojon 2016). The post-2005 slowdown, however, goes beyond the manufacturing sec - tor. In the United States, it also happened in other sectors, such as retail and wholesale, as well as the ser vice economy as a whole. A striking pat - tern seen in the data is that industries that experienced fast- paced produc - tivity growth in the 1995-2004 de cade typically slowed down considerably in the following de cade, as indicated in figure 3-1 (Baily and Montalbano The Economy Is about Firms 83 2016). Besides firms in the construction, information, financial, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) sectors, which maintained a similar growth rate in both de cades, all other sectors \"reversed\" their growth pace. The pattern is consistent across many other countries, too. Bahar (2018) explores in detail the evolution of productivity of firms in a global data set and finds a number of in ter est ing facts regarding the distribution of firms' TFP for years 2006 and 2014 by sector. Based on this analy sis, two in ter est- ing facts arise, visualized in figure 3-2. First, median TFP in year 2014 is slightly lower than in year 2006, across all industries. In addition, disper - sion in TFP has increased for most sectors, if not all. Note that these facts are consistent across all industries, including ser - vices, which is frequently neglected because of lack of data. The importance of looking beyond manufacturing, however, is crucial when thinking about FIGURE 3-1 Changes in TFP Growth for Acceleration and Slowdown, Major Sectors Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery MiningManufacturing Utilitie sConstructionWholesale Trade Retail TradeTransportation an d WarehousingInformatio n an d Real EstateService s -3.0-2.0-1.01.02.03.0 -3.0 -2.0 -1.0 1.0 Productivity growth Source: Baily and Montalbano (2016).84 productive equity overall productivity growth in large economies such as the United States, Japan, and Eu ro pean nations. The service- oriented nature of these econo - mies could pres ent an impor tant challenge for future growth. This is because the established unconditional convergence in the manufacturing sector does not necessarily hold in the ser vice sector, for which international com - petition is less of an issue (Rodrik 2011). In fact, some economists have suggested that innovations in ser vices are less relevant in producing dra - matic changes in productivity and efficiency, claiming that the productiv - ity of an artist, for example, is not very di ff er ent today than centuries ago (Baumol and Bowen 1966). But this view can be challenged. Take, for example, sports. There are shocks in productivity that might not represent the long- run trend. The Jamaican runner Usain Bolt won the gold medal in three consecutive Olympic games (2008, 2012, and 2016) for the hundred- meter run, each time with a slightly di ff er ent per for mance (his 2012 time of 9.63 seconds remains his best, as well as the Olympic rec ord). When looking at average per for mance of runners throughout the 1900s, the improvement has been FIGURE 3-2 TFP Distribution by Sector, 2006 and 2014 4 2 0 -2 All Industries Agriculture/Fishing Mining/Utilities/ ConstructionManufacturingCommerceFIRETotal factor productivity , logarith m 2006 2014 Source: Bahar (2018). The Economy Is about Firms 85 dramatic. Before Jim Haines (United States), no Olympic athlete had run one hundred meters in less than ten seconds. In fact, if Bolt and Jesse Owens had raced together, Owens would still have had fourteen feet to go by the time Bolt arrived at the finish line.2 These improvements prob ably have little to do with the fact that all humans are faster today than they were de cades ago. It is, in fact, a consequence of athletes having improved their training techniques, as well as improvements in technologies that provide them in - puts that fuel productivity, such as special clothing, nutrition, or improve - ment mea sure ment precision. These same ideas apply to all firms in the ser vice sector that could in - novate and use technology- embedded inputs that would make them more productive. The fast-food industry, for example, underwent a number of improvements in the past de cades that allowed it to significantly reduce the time between ordering and serving food, incidentally reducing costs and human mistakes. In the retail sector, for example, stores have become more productive by innovating in providing tailored customer ser vice by using data and expanding their platforms online. Innovation and the adoption of technology can improve the way ser vice firms, as well as manufacturing ones, deliver to their customers. A Framework to Understand Productivity Slowdown In a nutshell, there are two components in the dynamics linking firm productivity to overall economic growth. First is the improvement in produc - tivity for each firm in the economy over time, known as the \"within\" compo - nent. The second is the growth in size of the most productive firms relative to the least productive ones, known as the \"reallocation\" component. The reallocation component, in fact, reflects the pro cess through which least productive firms shed labor and other resources\u2014 either because they exit the market or simply become smaller\u2014 toward the most productive ones. On the aggregate, the speed at which these two pro cesses occur is the key factor that differentiates fast-growing countries from slow-growing ones (McMillan, Rodrik, and Verduzco- Gallo 2014). Historically, the contribution of each component\u2014 within and reallocation\u2014 has been di ff er ent depending on the period and the industry under consideration. A Brookings paper (Baily, Hulten, and Campbell 1992) 86 productive equity studying productivity growth in the United States manufacturing sector shows that, overall, the reallocation effect has been positive and significant during every five- year period from 1972 to 1987. That is, a big chunk of pro - ductivity growth in the United States during that period can be attributed to the fact that the most productive firms took over a larger portion of the market share in the overall economy. The within component, however, did not always contribute to overall productivity growth. During the period from 1972 to 1977, for example, manufacturing firms became more produc - tive, but this growth was driven exclusively by firms in the computer and the automobile industry. During the period from 1977 to 1982, firms experi - enced a decrease in their productivity that was compensated by the reallo - cation effect. Fi nally, during the period from 1982 to 1987, the within effect dominated overall productivity growth in manufacturing, and overall pro - ductivity was fueled by the reallocation component. All in all, these two components are essential for overall productivity growth, and they all could play a role in explaining the productivity slow - down of the past de cade. This framework is impor tant to understand what could be behind the decreasing productivity growth. Even if some or even most firms experience improvements, overall productivity growth might suf - fer if workers and other resources flow from the most toward the least pro - ductive firms. This is, for example, what happened in Latin American during the period from 1990-2005, when in spite of productivity increases among active industries, overall growth was below potential given flows of workers to least productive industries, often in the informal sector (Pag\u00e9s 2010). Mc - Millan, Rodrik, and Verduzco- Gallo (2014) expand this decomposition dur - ing the same period for other regions and shows a similar case for African nations, whereas countries in Asia experienced unusually high productivity growth of almost 4 percent a year, due both to their industries becoming more productive and the reallocation of resources toward these industries. In the context of the recent productivity slowdown, all components might play a role. If dynamism in the economy is hurt, then the realloca - tion and entry/exit components could hinder overall growth. This can be a result of firms not responding effectively to changes in their idiosyncratic productivity. If firms that are least productive are less likely to exit, or if more productive firms fail to attract resources from less productive ones, for example, then overall growth slows down. The Economy Is about Firms 87 Slowdown in Reallocation? The historic importance of reallocation of labor and the role of entry and exit has been established by many economists. Yet, evidence suggests that dynamism in the United States has been declining in recent de cades and, therefore, could play a part in the slowdown that started since the early 2000s. Firms have been less responsive to changes in their individual pro - ductivity levels, and this has significant implications for overall growth. Slowdown in reallocation can play both a positive and a negative role on overall growth. In general, in sectors where it is more likely that any given firm can grow to dominate a big part of the market, dynamism plays an impor tant role. A successful technology start-up with high potential to grow would require resources to flow toward it. A decrease of dynamism in this case would imply that resources aren't flowing toward firms with the highest potential to grow. On the other hand, once resources have moved to the fastest-growing firms, declining dynamism might contribute to over - all growth, as happened with the retail sector in the United States during the 1990s and early 2000s. After having already employed a large share of the industry- wide workforce\u2014 most likely flowing from small and unpro - ductive mom- and- pop stores\u2014 big-box stores kept a fast pace in their productivity growth, contributing to overall industry growth. Thus, real - location is particularly impor tant in industries where small firms can grow very fast by pioneering innovations, and compete with even the largest firms, such as ICT- producing or ICT- using sectors. In the United States, declining dynamism in the high- tech industries since the 2000s can explain a significant loss in annual growth up to 2010 (Decker and others 2018). This decline in dynamism is a result of the in - ability of firms to respond to changes in their productivity, and this could be explained by frictions or high adjustment costs. For example, unneces - sary subsidies or high closing costs for a failing enterprise would keep such firms in the market longer, occupying resources that, ideally, could be re - allocated to more productive firms in the same sector. Similarly, inflexible labor markets could impede fast-growing firms from hiring more workers when needed and, thus, keep them from responding positively to produc - tivity improvements. Declining trends of job reallocation in the United States have been com - mon across all industries since the early 2000s, as can be seen in figure 3-3. 88 productive equity Both the information and the FIRE industries have experienced a stable, even rising, rate in job reallocation since the 1980s until the early 2000s, after which the rate sharply declined. This post-2000 decline is consistent with the productivity slowdown seen across the economy. In addition, data shows that young firms in the United States (less than five years old), across all sectors, employ a smaller share of the economy than they did in the early 1980s. If over the past three de cades most of the productivity growth had concentrated more among mature firms\u2014 rather than the younger firms\u2014 then the shifting of resources from young to ma - ture firms would be, in fact, optimal for overall productivity growth. This was, as discussed, the case for retail trade, but not for the other industries. The shifting of resources away from small firms goes hand- in- hand with the productivity slowdown. In fact, employment growth among firms that experienced improvements in productivity has weakened today as com - pared to the 1980s, both for young and mature firms. This pattern is con - sistent both for high technology and other plants in the manufacturing sector in the United States.Source: Decker and others (2018).2025303540Job reallocation rate 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 Manufacturing Retail Information FIRE ServicesFIGURE 3-3 Sectoral Trends in Job Reallocation The Economy Is about Firms 89 How impor tant is reallocation in explaining the overall slowdown in productivity as compared to other components? The short answer: not much. A recent paper by Chang- Tai Hsieh and Peter Klenow shows that the decline in dynamism can explain up to 10 percent of the decline in pro - ductivity growth in the United States (Hsieh and Klenow 2018). The big - gest chunk of what explains a loss in aggregate productivity is, then, the within component. In fact, as shown by Bahar (2018) and visualized in figure 3-2, firms\u2014 on average\u2014 reduced their productivity between 2006 and 2014. Yet, firms becoming less productive, on the aggregate, is a difficult concept to digest. Are firms now doing less than they could do with the same resources than before? Some industries are. In the United States alone, for instance, during the 2004-14 period industries such as apparel and leather products, paper products, chemicals, plastics, as well as furniture, among others, experi - enced negative productivity growth (Baily and Montalbano (2016). Figure 3-2 reflects changes in productivity between 2006 and 2014, just around the Great Recession. Thus, part of this negative growth can be explained as a drop in demand for the industry as a whole, which resulted in reduced sales without immediate changes in the resources the firm employed. This will result in a productivity drop, following the standard mea sure - ment techniques. Yet, as noted, the slowdown in productivity preceded the recession in 2007 and, therefore, even if only suggestive, these results sup - port the idea that, even during a period of crisis, reallocation played a positive role. The analysis that follows focuses on understanding firm- level productivity dynamics. Innovation and Adoption Simply put, improvements to the productivity of a single firm can be ex - plained in one of two ways: innovation or adoption. Innovation implies the creation of a new and unique method, idea, or product that allows the firm to create more output using the same amount of resources. Adoption, on the other hand, implies that a firm gains access to methods, ideas, or prod - ucts that were in ven ted by other firms (normally within the same sector) to be able to do more with the same inputs. In fact, innovation is typically done by firms at the frontier who invest large amounts of their bud gets in 90 productive equity research and development (R&D) activities, while other, smaller firms grow due to access to previous innovation by other firms in the industry. Both components are crucial; in the absence of innovation there is no produc - tivity growth, and in the absence of adoption not only would most firms not grow (hindering overall productivity growth), there would be less in - centive to innovate for frontier firms, given the lack of competition. The importance of adoption in the pro cess of productivity growth is crit - ical. Even if technologies exist and are available in the country, the pro cess of aggregate growth requires the eventual diffusion of these technologies widely across firms and not only the ones that in ven ted them or adopted them first. An example of an adoption of an already existing technology is the implementation of a customer relationship system that allows the firm to be more efficient in the management of customers, suppliers, and inven - tory and brings with it the ability to produce more output with the same resources. The historic trend of both the availability of technologies and their penetration is quite striking. Diego Comin and Mart\u00ed Mestieri Ferrer, two economists studying the historical diffusion of technologies, find that while diffusion of technologies across countries (what they call the extensive mar - gin) is much faster than in the past, the penetration (the intensive margin) of those technologies within the country has slowed down (Comin and Fer - rer, 2013). For instance, it took, on average, forty- five years for the telegraph to reach all countries in the world after it was in ven ted in the 1830s. On the other hand, a newer technology, such as cell phones, took on average only five years to reach all countries after it was in ven ted in the early 1970s. The speed of penetration within other countries relative to Western nations was, however, significantly faster for the telegraph than for the cell phone. In short, as compared to the past century, newer technologies diffuse faster across countries but much slower within countries. This implies that frictions for the adoption of technologies by firms have increased, which would have a direct result in the dispersion of productivity within industries. Dispersion is precisely what is also documented in figure 3-2. Between 2006 and 2014, not only the median productivity declined but the disper - sion in TFP increased as well, across all sectors (see Bahar 2018 for more details on this). This could be a result of a number of developments. First, the weakening of business dynamism; in a highly competitive environment, The Economy Is about Firms 91 firms would be forced by the market to follow \"up or out\" dynamics. That is, small firms that don't grow because they have been proven to be unpro - ductive would not be able to remain in the market. But in an environment with weak business dynamism, small unproductive firms will remain in the market longer, drawing down the average and increasing the dispersion. Second, the mix of continuous innovation by frontier firms, together with high adoption frictions for the rest of the firms within that industry, are consistent with the results of Comin and Mestieri. If the ability of firms at any part of the distribution to adopt technologies is di ff er ent from firms at the top, for example, dispersion would increase too. High productivity dispersion is consistent with the findings of the work by Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal (2016). Their findings show how produc - tivity grew much faster for firms at the technological frontier as compared to laggard firms within the same industry and that the productivity gap between the two groups of firms widened greatly (see figure 3-4). That im - plies that large firms, such as Google and Facebook, would become much more productive by the day relative to smaller firms who are not at the fron - tier, who for a variety of reasons are unable to adopt technologies that would make them grow fast too. This might seem like an obvious result, but it is not quite, as it contradicts an impor tant belief held by economists about growth: convergence. Since small firms start at a much lower level of productivity than large firms, the latter will tend to grow much faster than the former. But the results by Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal (2016) show a picture that is consistent with divergence, not convergence. The most productive firms will keep becom - ing more and more productive relative to the least productive ones, increasing dispersion. Before digging deeper into the concept of convergence and divergence, there is more to say about dispersion. The first question to examine is whether dispersion has been increasing systematically or if it has changed in response to booms and recessions. Naturally, business cycles could explain some level of dispersion given het - erogeneous changes in firms' response to booms and recessions in terms of investing or, on the contrary, cutting back on investment to adopt new technologies (Kehrig 2015). In fact, the average slowdown in TFP during and after the global recession can be partly attributed to the decline in the speed of adoption of new technologies in response to credit disruptions that Source: Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal (2016).0.00 -0.100.100.200.300.40 Frontier firms Non-frontier firms Top 5% 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013Services sector Total factor productivity (2001 = 0) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 20130.000.10 -0.100.200.300.40Total factor productivity (2001 = 0)Manufacturing sector Frontier firms Non-frontier firms Top 5%FIGURE 3-4 Growth at the Frontier versus Laggards The Economy Is about Firms 93 have shocked the U.S. economy since the beginning of the worldwide re - cession in 2007. Yet the slowdown prior to 2007 could be explained by a decline in the ability of R&D investment to bear fruit (Anzoategui and others 2016). Thus, both structural and cyclical factors have played a role in the technology adoption patterns of firms in recent de cades and, with it, the trends in productivity dispersion. Indeed, slowing productivity is a trend that precedes the Great Recession. The fact that productivity dispersion is per sis tent and large even within nar - rowly defined firms isn't new, either. For example, research that uses the 1977 U.S. Census of Manufactures show impor tant differences in produc - tivity across plants within a four- digit industry; plants at the 75th percentile were, on average, twice as productive as plants in the 25th percentile in terms of labor productivity.3 This differential, however, has increased further since then, not only for manufacturing but for all other sectors, as shown Source: Decker and others (2016). Note: Y axis does not begin at zero. Data reflect interdecile range of log labor productivity devi - ated from industry by year means. Sectors are defined on a consistent NAICS basis.

Even though the ser vice sectors have higher levels of productivity dispersion than manufacturing, increasing dispersion across time is common to all. In fact, within manufacturing, in - creasing dispersion since the 1980s is pres ent for both high- technology firms as well as low- technology ones, and within younger and mature firms. Across the board, productivity dispersion is increasing. Convergence and Divergence So what explains increasing dispersion and, perhaps most impor tant, why should we care about it? As mentioned, in the presence of frictions for adoption, this could af - fect the typical convergence patterns that economists would expect across firms. Firms at the bottom of the productivity distribution would be ex - pected to grow faster, in relative terms, than those at the top of the distri - bution. Why? Because the pro cess of adoption is much easier than that of invention. This is, in fact, the essence of convergence. Technology adoption costs, both in terms of resources and time, are smaller than technology dis - covery costs. As such, less productive firms can enjoy faster productivity growth just by adopting the technologies discovered by those firms at the frontier. The frontier\u2014 those firms at the top of the distribution\u2014 face a tougher challenge. They have already adopted all the innovations that took them where they are; therefore, to keep growing, they need to lead the in - novation pro cess. Even if they are successful, they likely won't be able to grow as fast as those that are only adopting technologies. One way to examine divergence is to look at each firm's productivity growth trajectory, say, three years down the road, conditional on its initial level. Bahar (2018) found that firms with low initial productivity levels typically experienced faster TFP annual growth over the following three years than firms with a higher level of productivity, consistent with con - vergence. This pro cess on its own would reduce dispersion, not increase it. Yet, the story doesn't end there. For the most productive firms, this pattern is reversed. It turns out that firms with very high levels of productivity tend to grow faster than their less productive peers, generating a U- shaped relationship between TFP growth and initial productivity levels, as shown in figure 3-6. The Economy Is about Firms 95 Thus, what we see in the data is a \" middle productivity trap\" prob lem. Firms starting low in the productivity scale experience fast- paced growth in TFP, and as they get closer to the productivity frontier, relative growth stagnates. But the top 1 percent keeps growing, and much faster than those in the middle. These dynamics create dispersion. The fast growth of the low productivity firms cannot offset the growth, of the ones at the top when looking at nominal increases. These convergence- divergence dynamics are pres ent across most sectors in the economy, particularly in manufacturing as well as in FIRE sectors, where adoption is key to remain competitive. They are also particularly strong for developing countries. The fact that some highly productive firms are able to maintain a fast pace when it comes to productivity growth suggests that innovation is, in - deed, taking place among these few firms. Yet, these new innovations seem not to be trickling down to other, less productive firms. In other words, there seem to be some friction in the pro cess of technology adoption. What these frictions could be is a key research question, but before we discuss the FIGURE 3-6 TFP Three- Year Growth Estimate Based on Initial TFP Levels Agriculture and Fishing -0.2 -3-2-101234 . Manufacturing Source: (2018).96 productive equity why, there is an impor tant question that is still up in the air: Does this matter? It turns out it does. Frictions in the technology adoption pro cess would result in larger productivity dispersion, which in turn has been associated with slower productivity growth. In fact, based on the sample used by Bahar (2018), growth is significantly slower among industries with the highest dis - persion (fourth quartile) than for those industries with the smallest dis - persion (first quartile) (see figure 3-7). We can now trace back this productivity slowdown, partly explained by frictions in the adoption pro cess, to economic growth. In the 1950s, Nobel laureate Robert Solow brought to economics a key insight that is highly relevant today: productivity growth is key to sustained economic growth. Countries grow by investing in acquiring more capital or in improving education attainment of their workforce, but the returns to these invest - ments in the long run are limited; thus, without changes in productivity, according to Solow, economic growth would decline. In the long run, it is productivity that matters more. In fact, it has been shown in several studies FIGURE 3-7 TFP Annual Growth 2008-13 by Bahar (2018) and author's calculations. The Economy Is about Firms 97 that over half of cross- country income differences can be explained by productivity differences (see Hall and Jones 1999). Concluding Remarks In the presence of frictions, firms at the frontier will be able to gain larger market shares, which in the long run could turn into weaker competition, affecting output and prices in several markets. The growth of these few firms is not enough to fuel the rest of the economy. These dynamics could affect other trends, such as income in equality, which has also been grow - ing within countries in recent de cades. Overall these patterns pres ent a plausible explanation of the productiv - ity slowdown experienced by most advanced economies since the begin - ning of the current century, and that has been documented by many. What could stand behind these patterns is out of the scope of this par tic u lar chap - ter, but a plausible factor could be the increasing presence of frictions in technology adoption by lower productivity firms. Under such a possibility, public policy could play an impor tant role in helping to overcome the mar - ket failures causing such divergence. Notes 1. Another widely used definition is \" labor productivity,\" which mea sures how much output per worker a firm makes. Note that this mea sure does not take into account that two firms with the same number of workers could differ in the amount of machinery they use or in the way they use their materials. Yet, there usually is a large and positive correlation between TFP and labor productivity. 2. A story in the New York Times published on 08/15/2016 details this claim.

DANY BAHAR and KARIM FODA The paradox of seemingly rapid technological change and slow productiv - ity growth has no single, master explanation, but a careful look at some key developments across advanced and major emerging economies reveals some consistent explanations. Many of these same developments are also correlated with high inequalities in many economies, such as those between rich and poor or educated and less educated. We focus specifically on pos - si ble reasons behind the productivity slowdown despite rapid technologi - cal pro gress. Some of the reasons for weak productivity growth are cyclical in nature, but the slowdown has been under way too long to be explained by the short- term ups and downs of an economy. Ultimately, the declining trend in productivity growth is led by factors that do not come and go in cycles but are embedded in an evolving structure of the economy and the incentives that firms face when making decisions on investing, hiring, reor ga niz ing, and, ultimately, producing. Before wading into the inner workings of the economy, a bigger question looms over the productivity puzzle: Is technological pro gress as rapid as we think it is? Improvements in productivity depend on the forward march of technological pro gress and innovation. It is the application of technology to 102 productive equity the production pro cess that yields productivity gains, but di ff er ent ways of thinking about innovation can lead one to believe that the frontier of tech - nology itself has, perhaps, reached its limits. It would follow, then, that the scope for productivity- enhancing innovation may be approaching its limits, too. If that were the case, the productivity slowdown would be with us whether the economy is firing on all cylinders or not. Let us investigate. Is Innovation Slowing Down? One does not need to look far to see the impact of innovation on our lives: smartphones with real- time traffic updates, intelligent machines providing investment advice and legal expertise, global digital networks and cloud computing, gene therapy and stem- cell transplants, self- driving cars. The list goes on. Optimism in Silicon Valley is unbounded, and by all appear - ances we are in a golden age of innovation (Aeppel 2015). But the slowdown in productivity growth has led many to won der if the seemingly rapid pace of technological pro gress is just a fa\u00e7ade, if today's pro gress pales in com - parison to the transformative technological breakthroughs of the past. Is innovation advancing as rapidly as it appears, or is it actually slowing down and becoming less impactful, as the productivity trends might suggest? There is some reason to believe that ideas are getting harder to find. The inputs to innovation have been growing, but the outputs do not appear to be keeping pace. In terms of inputs, spending on R&D has trended modestly higher over the last thirty years, and there are more scientists and engineers than ever before (figure 4-1).1 The outputs are more difficult to mea sure, how - ever. The number of patents granted is traditionally used as a quantifiable marker of innovation, but this is not always a reliable mea sure. Some patents may be more valuable in terms of their innovative novelty or in terms of their contribution to a com pany's output and productivity than others.2 Anne Marie Knott of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, uses firm- level data on R&D investments, patents, revenues, and other characteristics to esti - mate the value of patents, finding that only 10 percent of patents comprise 85 percent of the total value of all patents in the United States. Knott estimates \"R&D productivity\" is essentially the ratio of a firm's revenues to its R&D investment, estimating that overall R&D productivity in the United States declined 65 percent over the last three de cades (figure 4-2).Source: OECD Main Science and Technology Indicators. Note: Some variation exists by country. For example, the U.K.'s share of R&D spending in GDP has declined since the early 1980s, but the majority of countries have increased their spending as share of their economies. OECD aggregates include Mexico.0.200.250.300.35 1.92.02.12.22.32.4 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Research employment as a percent of total population R&D spending as a percent of GDP R&D spending share of GDP (LHS) Research employment share of population (RHS)FIGURE 4-1 R&D Spending and Share of Researchers in the OECD, 1981-2015 FIGURE 4-2 R&D Productivity in the United States, 1975-2015 0.10.2 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015R&D productivity as raw RQ Source: Knott (2017). is a metric developed by Knott (2017) that stands for Research Quotient, which is essentially a ratio of firm revenues to R&D investment. See more detail in Cooper, Knott, and Yang (2015).104 productive equity In other words, it is requiring more research effort to generate a simi - lar amount of innovation. Consider Moore's Law\u2014 the doubling of the computing capacity of a semiconductor chip every two years since 1971. Economists at Stanford and MIT used data on semiconductor R&D from a number of semiconductor firms and equipment manufacturers to find that the research effort needed just to maintain Moore's Law today is around 78 times greater than it was in 1971. They found similar results of declining \"ideas productivity\" in other areas of the economy, from vari - ous agricultural crop yields to mortality and life expectancy (Bloom and others 2017). There are a number of explanations for why this could be the case. One of them suggests a \"burden of knowledge.\" As ideas accumulate and technology advances, it becomes more costly to innovate, taking longer for new researchers to catch up with the frontier in their area of expertise (Jones 2009). Another suggests that a decline in public spending on basic research has lowered the chances for new discoveries to be widely shared and built upon (box 4-1). A di ff er ent explanation suggests that increasing environmental or safety regulations are raising barriers to commercial - izing new ideas. For example, meeting vehicle safety and fuel- emission standards gobbled up extra research effort that once helped make roads safer and the air less polluted, but those benefits do not translate into out - put (Ip 2016). The most prominent explanation for why innovation might be slowing down asserts that there are simply no more major innovations to be found. Economic historian Robert Gordon, in his 2016 book The Rise and Fall of American Growth , argues that the impact of the transformative techno - logical breakthroughs of the second industrial revolution cannot be re - peated or rivaled. After cars and airplanes were introduced, for example, later innovations that improve speed, efficiency, and safety could not be nearly as impactful as the initial transformation from horses and railroads to wheels and wings. When productivity growth slowed in the 1970s, the broad majority of factories in advanced economies had been electrified, house holds already owned refrigerators and tele vi sions, and medical break - throughs had increased life expectancy faster than they are likely to in the future. Tyler Cowen of George Mason University (2011) suggests we have plucked the low- hanging fruits of innovation and are now stagnating in a technological plateau. Though the productivity- enhancing spread of ICT in The Technology-Productivity Paradox 105 BOX 4-1 Innovation and Public Investment in Basic Research Public investment in basic research tends to be positively related with private sector innovative activity and productivity growth. Basic research is experimental work aimed at acquiring new knowl - edge and discoveries without any specific application necessarily in view. Private firms are more actively engaged in applied research that focuses its efforts on a direct application that can provide a monetary reward. Basic research helps push the frontier of discov - ery and knowledge, which provides the foundation for applied re - search by all firms to offer innovative applications and enhance productivity growth. Some of these innovations that spawned from public investment in basic R&D include the Internet, Google's basic research algorithm, and key features of Apple smartphones. However, public investment in basic R&D has declined in many major economies. In the US, government spending on R&D fell from 1.2 percent of GDP in the early 1980s to half that level in 2015. Further - more, the share of basic research in the US supported by the fed - eral government has fallen to its lowest level of 44 percent, com - pared to over 70 percent in the 1960s and 1970s. The overall rise in total R&D spending as a share of GDP shown in figure 4-1 is therefore driven by private investment in R&D. Recent research suggests that the decline in public R&D and its focus on basic research is a con - tributory factor to the decline in the productivity of overall R&D (Bloom and others 2017). 1996-2004 in the United States made its impact, the wave was short- lived and is now over. But there is a totally di ff er ent view of innovation that lends itself to the opposite conclusion\u2014 that we are in the midst of rapid technological pro - gress that will only accelerate. It does not see innovation as ideas that \"get used up\" but rather as blocks of ideas that combine with other blocks to produce even more innovation. This combinatorial or recombinant view of innovation challenges the notion that ideas are getting harder to find by 106 productive equity suggesting the opposite\u2014 that the number of available ideas only grows over time as they combine and recombine with each other. MIT economists Erik Brynjolffson and Andrew McAfee (2014, p. 81) argue that the unique properties of digital technology as well as its role as a general- purpose technology\u2014 one that can be applied across a broad range of sectors and activities\u2014 will result in an exponential rise in ideas. In their book, The Second Machine Age , they write: Digital innovation is recombinant innovation in its purest form. . . . Moore's Law makes computing devices and sensors exponentially cheaper over time, enabling them to be built eco nom ically into more and more gear, from doorknobs to greeting cards. Digitization makes massive bodies of data relevant to almost any situation, and this information can be infinitely reproduced and reused because it is non- rival. As a result of these two forces, the number of potentially valuable building blocks is exploding around the world, and the possibilities are multiplying as never before. The biggest limit, they say, is to identify which combination of building blocks will be valuable, requiring more eyeballs and even bigger computers to sift through ever- increasing amounts of data. This is consistent with the fact that some firms in the economy\u2014 typically those at the frontier\u2014 have become more and more productive relative to the rest, as shown in several studies, including Dan Andrews and others (2016) and Dany Bahar (2018). This is likely the result of innovation at the fron - tier, which, even if more difficult, is still happening. Yet, for aggregate pro - ductivity growth to pick up the pace, it is not enough for some firms to innovate; it requires a broad range of firms to adopt new technologies and best practices. It is this adoption pro cess by laggard firms that appears weak. The Determinants of Productivity Growth A 2015 survey by Fortune magazine of the CEOs of the biggest 500 compa - nies in the world found that 72 percent of them view the rapid pace of tech - nological innovation as their com pany's biggest challenge, and 94 percent believe their com pany will change more in the next five years than it has in The Technology-Productivity Paradox 107 the last five years. While these large firms wrestle with the expanding tech - nological frontier, the rest of the economy seems to be lagging behind. As shown in Bahar (2018), firms at the frontier of productivity growth within each narrowly defined sector have continued apace, suggesting continued robustness in innovative activity. The widening productivity gap between frontier firms and lagging firms suggests a weakening of the diffusion of new technologies across the broad landscape of small, medium, and other large firms. For technological pro gress to have an impact on overall growth and productivity, its adoption by a broad range of firms and industries throughout the economy is critical. Before diving straight into the reasons behind the weakening diffusion of technological pro gress, let us first take a step back to ensure we cover all the major bases for what drives productivity growth and what could ex - plain its slowdown. Let us begin with a framework for what determines aggregate productivity to guide us through its key drivers. Figure 4-3 iso - lates the two key components that affect a country's productivity\u2014 the reallocation of resources from low- to high-productivity firms and the pro - ductivity growth of the firms themselves. Under each of these two compo - nents are key determinants that can ultimately facilitate productivity growth or slow it down.FIGURE 4-3 A Framework for Explaining Productivity Aggregate Productivity CompetitionInvestments in Tangible Inputs (physical and human capital)Investment in Intangible Inputs (knowledge-based capital)Within-Firm Productivity (innovation and adoption)Reallocation Across Firms108 productive equity Reallocation The first component in figure 4-3, reallocation, is directly affected by one subcomponent: competition; that is, the Darwinian se lection pro cess that takes place through which less productive firms exit the market and shed resources ( labor, capital) that are\u2014 ideally\u2014 reallocated toward more pro - ductive firms. Conceptually, an economy can increase its aggregate produc - tivity without a significant degree of technological pro gress at all by constantly reshuffling resources to where they can be most productive, as the firms that die are replaced by new, more productive ones. Over the last two de cades, there has been a slowdown in this competi - tive se lection pro cess. The rate of new business formation has been on a de - clining trend since the late 1970s in the United States and more recently across other OECD economies. In 2013, business start-up rates were around 30 percent lower than the annual average in the 1980s, and the decline has affected nearly all business sectors. The rate at which firms exit the market has also slowed, resulting in a larger share of older firms that face less competitive pressure from fewer new entrants. In the late 1970s, new firms accounted for 16 percent of all firms in the United States. By 2011, that share had been cut in half, to 8 percent. This trend has been most pronounced in the United States but has also been under way in most other OECD countries (figure 4-4). That there are fewer new entrants suggests there has been a decline in reallocation of resources from less to more productive firms. In a dynamic economy, it is typically young, productive firms that tend to generate new ideas and create jobs. However, in addition to the fact that there are fewer new entrants, post- entry growth of new entrants has also slowed. A 2014 study by Steven Davis of the University of Chicago and Jon Haltiwanger of the University of Mary land (2014) reports that, after 2000, start-up rates in high technology and information- processing firms fell, and those firms that did enter did not experience the same rapid growth as earlier cohorts. The magnitude of diminished business dynamism and the direct im - pact of competitive se lection pro cesses on aggregate productivity growth is not so clear, however. Critics point out that the acceleration in produc - tivity growth in the United States in the late 1990s and early 2000s is in - consistent with the continued decline in business dynamism over that time period, suggesting that older firms may be just as innovative as newcomers.3 FIGURE 4-4 Declining Business Dynamism 91113 1978 1983 1988 1993 1998 2003 2008 2013Firm Entry Firm ExitPercentDeclining rm entry and exit in the USA, 1978-2013 (% of all rms) Declining start-up rates in OECD countries (% of rms that are 0-2 years old) Percent 51015202530 Spain UK USA Belgium Canada Sweden Norway Italy 2001-03 2004-06 2007-09 2010-11 Source: U.S. Census Bureau (top panel) and Criscuolo, Gal, and Menon (2014) (bottom panel).110 productive equity A 2017 paper by Chang- Tai Hsieh and Peter Klenow suggests that the de - cline in dynamism (as defined by job reallocation and the contribution of new entrants to job creation) has contributed as much as 10 percent to the decline in productivity growth in the United States, a notable amount but leaving most unexplained. The type of competition that drives Darwinian survival dynamics can come in many forms beyond the pure entry and exit of firms. For instance, unequal access to capital could hinder the allocation of capital to small but highly productive firms in need of more inputs to keep growing. Alterna - tively, subsidies on inputs that benefit thriving low-productivity firms would tend to drag machinery from firms without subsidies that could use such machinery much more efficiently. For some developing countries, such as China and India, eliminating these inefficiencies could result in increases in aggregate productivity of up to 60 percent (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009). Misallocation of Capital and Labor At the heart of the reallocation story stands the ability of all firms to get the optimal allocation of resources. In real ity, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)\u2014 many of them with high growth potential\u2014 typically face stronger financing constraints than larger firms, mostly due to high financing costs and increased perceptions of riskiness by investors. In 2014, the OECD reported that SMEs across OECD countries continued to suffer relative to larger firms from both reduced availability of internal funding after the Great Recession and low credit availability from the bank - ing sector after the Great Recession. In the United States, for example, the share of loans to small firms out of total business loans dropped from 30.1 percent in 2009 to 23.7 percent in 2012. According to the report, bank lending continues to be the most common source of external finance for small firms (OECD 2014). Since 2007, SMEs experienced tougher credit terms than larger firms, in the form of shortened maturities, increased re - quests for collateral, and higher interest rates. Between 2007 and 2013, the median interest rate spread between loans to SMEs and to large enter - prises across twenty- four advanced economies rose from 0.8 to 1.3 (OECD 2016c).4 For firms with weaker balance sheets before the financial crisis, tight credit conditions after the financial crisis had a more acute impact on their The Technology-Productivity Paradox 111 productivity than other firms with less overall debt and lower short- term financing needs, especially in countries most affected by the euro area cri - sis. Research by the IMF finds that, on average across countries, the decline in average post- crisis TFP growth (2008-13) was 1.01 percentage points greater for firms with high financial leverage than for low- leverage firms. In countries where credit conditions deteriorated more (sharper increases in bank credit default swap spreads), the same gap was 1.31 percentage points (IMF 2017; Duval, Hong, and Timmer 2017). This \"missing growth\" of the low- leverage firms due to credit market frictions is, naturally, re - flected in lower aggregate productivity growth. More generally, all market inefficiencies create misallocations that keep the \"right\" firms from getting the resources they need to compete in the market while, at the same time, allowing low-productivity firms to survive longer than they should. In advanced economies, there is evidence that the misallocation of cap - ital began to rise before the financial crisis, and rose further in its after - math (figure 4-5) (IMF 2017). In Eu rope, the inception of the Eurozone in the late 1990s and the resulting decline in interest rates for many of its members triggered a sharp rise in poorly intermediated capital inflows that drove a notable misallocation of capital across southern Eu rope (Gopinath Source: IMF (2017); Duval, Hong, and Timmer (2017).

Estimates for Italian manufacturing firms suggest that TFP levels would have been 12 percent higher in 2007 if the efficiency of resource allocation had remained at its 1997 level (Calligaris 2015), while estimates for Spain suggest that rising misallocation held down TFP growth by 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points a year between 1995 and 2007 (Garcia- Santana and others 2016). After the financial crisis, capital misal - location worsened more broadly across advanced economies. The pro - ductivity growth of financially constrained firms grew more slowly relative to financially healthier firms. Making matters worse, many of these finan - cially constrained firms stayed alive as \"zombie firms,\" as banks may have extended \"evergreen\" loans to weak firms to delay recognition of losses (IMF 2017). An OECD study estimates that the rise in the share of the industry capital stock stuck in zombie firms can account for around 15 percent of the decline in the efficiency of capital allocation across a set of OECD economies (Adalet McGowan, Andrews, and Millot 2017). On the other hand, misallocation of labor\u2014 conditional on the observed allocation of capital\u2014 has remained steady since the mid-2000s in advanced economies, and thus it is not a likely candidate to explain the productivity slowdown. However, when taking skills into the picture, as technological change pushes ahead, the difficulties in matching the right workers with the right jobs is another impor tant source of misallocation. Areas with tight labor market regulations, like strict rules for hiring and firing in Eu rope or the rise in the number of licenses and certifications required to do certain jobs in the United States, have contributed to sizable skill mismatches that have helped suppress faster productivity growth. Figure 4-6 shows how sizable productivity gains from reducing skill mis - matches and improving the allocative efficiency of skills alone could be. In Eu rope, a growing body of research finds that lower flexibility in labor mar - kets has limited the ability of firms to reor ga nize with new business models and skill requirements to take full advantage of productivity- enhancing ICT and digital technologies.5 In the United States, state- level licensing regulations grew by a factor of five in the second half of the twentieth century with the intention to protect health and safety but in some cases at the expense of increased inefficiency, especially for smaller firms or entrepre - neurs. Zoning restrictions in U.S. cities have also heightened housing sup - ply constraints, reducing the efficiency of labor allocation at the state and national levels. The Technology-Productivity Paradox 113 Firm Productivity Growth The second component in figure 4-3 directly links the pro cess of produc - tivity growth to the ability of individual firms to grow mainly by innovat - ing and adopting new technologies or innovations. In addition to entry and exit dynamics, the degree of competition in an industry heavi ly influ - ences both the ability and the willingness of firms to make productivity- enhancing investments in both tangible and intangible inputs that enable faster technology adoption. When confronted with stiff competition, firms must often invest to raise their productivity to retain their market share, or to survive at all. Investment in tangible inputs\u2014 like equipment, fixed capital, and work - ers with a range of skills\u2014 and intangible inputs\u2014 like business pro cesses, organ ization design, patents, ideas, and copyrights\u2014 are critical for all firms to improve their productivity and grow. Over the last two de cades, how - ever, private investment rates have been falling, and small to medium-size firms have faced growing credit restrictions, limiting their capacity to in - vest in themselves. Figure 4-7 shows the overall decline in private investment since the 1980s in the United States with the exception of the 1990s, when productivity Source: Adalet, McGowan and Andrews (2015).

After the shock of the financial crisis, investment rates bounced back to around 10 percent across private non- financial firms, just half of the longer- term average from the 1960s until the turn of the century. In addition, firms' investment (or lack of it) is also determined by factors other than access to capital. In fact, when we focus only on access to capi - tal as a driver limiting firms' investment, there is a direct link between the reallocation and the within- firm components of aggregate productivity growth. In some sense, one becomes the mirror image of the other. In the presence of financial market inefficiencies, small firms with high poten - tial might not have access to resources that are in the hands of less pro - ductive firms (thus generating misallocation), and without such invest - ment their full potential won't be realized (that is, no growth due to no investment).Source: Gutierrez and Philippon (2017).10 020 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010Percent of net operating surplusFIGURE 4-7 Declining Investment by Private Non- Financial Firms, United States 1980-2015 The Technology-Productivity Paradox 115 While access to finance and other critical resources, like skilled work - ers, for example, mostly determines the ability of firms to invest, there are other factors\u2014 competition being a crucial one\u2014 that determine the will - ingness of firms to invest. In this section we focus on the latter, as the for - mer can also be seen from the reallocation lens. First, let's delve into the details of what these tangible and intangible inputs are, how they are a key for a firm's productivity, and what the evidence has to say about why firms are not investing as much as they could. Investing in Tangible Inputs: Physical and Human Capital Firms can adopt technologies by accessing tangible inputs, in par tic u lar, knowledge- embedded tangible inputs like sophisticated machinery or bet - ter man ag ers and trained workers. Yet, evidence consistent across countries suggests there is unequal access to such inputs across firms of di ff er ent sizes. This generates frictions in the ability of small firms to adopt technologies from the frontier. Knowledge- Embedded Physical Capital Upgrading to ICT capital and other forms of modern infrastructure\u2014 for example, data servers for storage, devices, networks, and other technology- embedded capital\u2014 allows firms to compete in a digital marketplace and to connect with suppliers at home or abroad. The technologies embodied in physical equipment can go a long way in improving productivity of firms, not only by increasing their efficiency in production but also by boosting their ability to adopt best practices and know-how from around the world by connecting them to other firms that other wise they might not have been exposed to. Investment in the necessary equipment and digital infrastruc - ture is becoming a growing prerequisite for firms to engage digitally and be linked into larger, even global networks. Box 4-2 touches on the impor - tance of public investment in infrastructure at the macro level. More broadly, there is very little understanding of what keeps many firms from investing in new equipment that could boost their productiv - ity, but it is known that, indeed, the slowdown in capital investment is strongly related to slower productivity growth. According to IMF estimates, 116 productive equity BOX 4-2 The Macro Barriers to Investment and Productivity In the short run, investment can stimulate economic activity and demand. In the long run, it can raise potential output by raising pro - ductivity. The role of investment in enhancing productivity is struc - tural in nature, though firms' investment decisions are driven by both short- and long- run factors. Weak aggregate demand in the post- crisis period, declining public investment, and heightened lev - els of policy uncertainty are some major macro- level factors that en - courage firms to delay investment decisions. Weak Aggregate Demand. Several studies by the IMF, OECD, and others have established that weakness in aggregate demand has been a major contributor to weak investment in the post- crisis years. Many economies have been stuck in a low- growth, low- investment equilibrium, generating concerns that the shock of the financial cri - sis may lead to permanent declines in the productive capacity of the economy. Estimates by researchers at the OECD suggest that the shock to demand after the crisis may have reduced the aggre - gate capital stock by about 3\u00bc percent across OECD countries (Olli - vaud and others 2016). Reduced capital investment not only reduces the contribution of capital to labor productivity, but it also reduces the diffusion of technological pro gress embodied in capital. Declining Public Investment. Public investment, particularly in in - frastructure, has generally been linked to faster productivity growth when done effectively. A study by John Fernald of the San Francisco Fed finds that road investment boosted productivity in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, and a more recent 2014 study in the Journal of Economic Surveys finds that public investment, especially by local or regional governments into roads, railways, and utilities, can also stimulate private investment. However, over the last few de cades in advanced economies, public investment has been de - clining as a share of GDP. Heightened Policy Uncertainty. Economic policy uncertainty in the post- crisis period appears to have played a significant role in delaying investment decisions by firms and generating an adverse The Technology-Productivity Paradox 117 effect on productivity. The \"wait and see\" approach by firms led them to cut investment and shift their focus toward shorter- term, lower- risk, and lower- return proj ects. A 2016 paper in the Quarterly Jour nal of Economics estimated that this effect of increased uncer - tainty contributed to the post- crisis slowdown in TFP growth by around 0.2 percent a year for Eu rope, 0.1 for Japan, and 0.07 for the United States compared to pre- crisis years (Baker, Bloom, and Davis 2016).FIGURE B4-2 Declining Real Public Investment in Advanced Economies Real public investment Percent of GDP 2.7 2.52.93.13.33.53.73.94.14.3 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 Source: IMF (2014). the impact that declining fixed capital formation has had on total factor pro - ductivity has been significant, particularly since the 2008 financial crisis. The evidence is clear that in advanced economies the slowdown in investment began before the crisis, but its contribution in explaining the slowdown in productivity growth has become more impor tant since. Extrapolating 118 productive equity from this evidence one can argue that, for firms, investment in capital has become more impor tant in explaining productivity growth over the past de cade. According to the OECD, fewer than 30 percent of SMEs in OECD coun - tries use cloud computing. They are discouraged by both the high costs of upgrading to digital infrastructure and concerns over costly security risks (OECD 2016b). There is an impor tant distinction between the two reasons. The first relates to access to capital, which we have discussed. The second relates to uncertainty on the returns to that investment due to high risks. Clearly, this might be an impor tant component explaining the lack of in - vestment in productivity- enhancing equipment for firms, in par tic u lar small ones. The benefits of upgrading to a digital infrastructure could be outweighed by the costs of something going bad, which is not unusual even for firms that invest highly in digital security. For instance, in the early fall of 2017, it became news that Equifax\u2014 a firm with over $3 billion in annual revenues and about 10,000 employees\u2014 had a serious digital security breach compromising private data of about 143 million U.S. consumers (Gressin 2017). If large and established firms strug gle with their digital infrastruc - ture, it is clear that investing in productivity- enhancing equipment of this new era comes with risks that could well outweigh the returns. Gartner Inc., a publicly traded research and advisory com pany, estimates that world - wide spending on information security reached $90 billion in 2017 and will top $113 billion by 2020 (Gartner Inc. 2017). Human Capital and Skills Workers and the skills they bring in are a crucial input of productivity growth. Workers are inherently di ff er ent in the skills they bring to the work - force, and some\u2014if not most\u2014 firms strug gle to recruit the best- suited workers. But even when looking at skill accumulation from a macro perspective, we can understand some of the current trends. Take schooling, for exam - ple, which provides a basic set of skills useful across all industries. Given that levels of schooling have increased significantly across the globe, natu - rally, the rate of human capital accumulation is now slower. The IMF estimates that this slowdown in the accumulation of human capital can explain up to 0.3 percentage points a year of \"missing\" productivity growth (see The Technology-Productivity Paradox 119 figure 4-8). In addition, population aging in advanced economies and major emerging economies like China adds more friction to the pace of human capi - tal accumulation and the supply of labor across firms. When assessing the skill level of workers in a par tic u lar firm, an impor - tant indicator is wages. When looking at average wages across firms and, in par tic u lar, the growing gap between firms that pay more and those that pay less for the same position, it becomes apparent that the most skilled workers are in the firms that pay more. The fact that some firms pay higher wages to their employees might also reflect the fact that these employees are simply more productive, but that would be the case when there is fully fledged competition (more on this later). On the other hand, if the reason some firms are able to retain workers by paying them more is because these firms' profit margins are much larger than the sector average, then this would reduce labor turnover and, with it, the ability of smaller firms with high potential to attract better workers. A 2018 paper published in Econometrica (Eeckhout and Kircher 2018) uses German employer- employee data to find that technological change is help - ing to drive \"assortative matching\" at large firms, where skilled workers Source: IMF (2017).0.20.40.60.81.01.2Average percent change, annual 1980s 1990s 2000s Advanced economies Emerging market economiesFIGURE 4-8 Contribution of Human Capital to Labor Productivity Growth120 productive equity are joining firms where other skilled workers are, which is, increasingly, in large productive firms, leaving less space for other firms to hire skilled work - ers with knowledge in the industry. In addition, a 2017 study by econo - mists at Harvard University, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Institute for Social Research in Norway found that productivity is higher in manufac - turing firms with a higher share of scientists and engineers involved in business operations (that is, not in R&D roles), facilitating the adoption of some technologies in the production pro cess. The earnings of these employees tend to be higher than the earnings of their counter parts in other plants with a lower share of scientists and engineers (Barth and others 2017). A body of economic lit er a ture shows that the skill and effectiveness of man ag ers, in par tic u lar, has an impact on productivity, with notable vari - ation between high- and low-productivity firms. In a neatly run experiment across Indian textile firms, economists mea sured the effect of improving management practices on productivity (Bloom and others 2013). Some firms, randomly selected, received five months of customized guidance on how to improve management practices\u2014 like factory operations, quality control, inventory management, and human resources management\u2014 from a large international management consulting firm, while the other Indian firms, which served as the control group, received one month of diagnostic consulting but no help in implementation. The results were striking. First, plants that received the most guidance improved their overall productivity by an average of 11 percent (in this ex - ample, primarily through improved quality and efficiency and reduced inventory). They also became less decentralized in the decisionmaking pro - cess as owners delegated more tasks to middle man ag ers and invested more in computers for data gathering and monitoring day- to- day activi - ties. Among all the plants in the control group who received one month of diagnostic and no help in implementation, only about 10 percent ended up adopting best management practices. Thus, the prob lem goes beyond in - formation on the existence of the technology. For a firm, possession of such information does not directly translate into adoption. Research has shown vast differences in managerial skills across firms. A survey of about 700 manufacturing firms across the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany shows strikingly large differ - ences in management scores (Bloom and Van Reenen 2007). The score is The Technology-Productivity Paradox 121 based on man ag ers' knowledge of things such as operations; and their practices in terms of monitoring, defining targets, and providing incen - tives to workers. Better management scores are found in firms exposed to the strongest competition and that have higher-quality workers. They tend to be lower in family firms where management is hereditary from generation to generation. Differences in management practices strongly explain differences in gross output, growth, and the probability of exit from the market. These are all variables that strongly correlate with productivity. It is not clear, however, why firms\u2014 small firms in particular\u2014 would de - cide not to adopt best managerial practices to begin with. There are two pos si ble explanations put forward by experts that seem impor tant: first, the lack of belief by the current management that adopting best practices would actually result in better outcomes; and second, lack of time due to under - staffing and other competing demands. Investing in Intangible Inputs: Knowledge- Based Capital Since the 1980s, business investment has shifted away from investments in machinery and equipment to investment in knowledge and other intangible knowledge- based capital (KBC) such as orga nizational capital (for example, internal decisionmaking and business pro cesses), training, branding, sup - plier and distributor relationships, software, databases, design, and other forms of intellectual property. Even after the investment shock of the 2008 financial crisis, investment in KBC held up better than investment in tan - gible capital (figure 4-9). Investment in intangibles has emerged as increas - ingly impor tant to underpin innovative activity and adoption. In a 2002 Brookings paper, Erik Brynjolffson, Lorin Hitt, and Shinkyu Yang esti - mated that for every dollar of investment in computer hardware, firms needed to invest an additional $9 in software, training, and business pro - cess design. The pro cess through which firms innovate requires investment in orga nizational knowledge\u2014 like reor ga niz ing production lines, business pro cesses, or organ ization structures\u2014or even in a firm culture that en - gages workers and enhances productivity. From the standpoint of an econ - omist, these investments should always be worthwhile as long as the returns raise profits. The challenge to these investments is that there are plenty of FIGURE 4-9 Intangible Investment in Knowledge- Based Capital Average growth in investment in KB C 0 -44812 FranceGermanyItaly NetherlandsSpainUKUSA 1995-2000 2000-07 2007-136810121416 1977 1979 1981 1983 1985 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015Business investment in KBC and tangible capital, US, 1977-2015 Tangible investment Intangible investment % of adjusted GDP Percent Source: Based on Corrado and Hulten (2010) and OECD (2016a). The Technology-Productivity Paradox 123 market failures related to investing in knowledge, and the intellectual property system used to address some of these failures has not been work - ing as intended, especially over the last ten to fifteen years. For example, the returns to investment in R&D, a component of knowledge- based capital, can easily be appropriated by copycat firms that have not made the original investment. Consider a winery that decides to grow a type of grape that no other winery in its geographic area grows. This involves costly research, training, and a lot of trial and error in adapting existing methods implemented by other wineries in remote locations to local conditions, such as quality of land and weather. Even after those ex - penses, typically more investment in marketing and, if necessary, reinvent - ing ways to deliver the new product to nearby and remote consumers will follow. After all this investment, the winery will be able (if successful) to enjoy the rents of selling its new wine. Yet, the knowledge generated by the winery in growing this unique grape in the local climate could easily be imitated by competing wineries with similar geographic conditions. In the absence of any patent or intellectual property system, the winery will have no incentive to make such costly in - vestments if its competitors will appropriate the returns. On the other hand, under the current regime, the pro cess of registering and enforcing intellectual property can be quite costly, particularly for smaller firms. The costs associated with globally protecting a patent quickly add up with the number of countries where the patent is to be registered in, and could reach, in some cases, hundreds of thousands of dollars. These costs could be pro - hibitive for small and medium firms relying on R&D investment to adopt technologies that could then be appropriated by others. Difficulties associated with adoption of technologies from the frontier can also be associated with too much patent protection, which slows the pace of technological diffusion. Given that large firms are able to protect their intellectual property much more effectively, this would discourage small firms from adopting existing technologies originated by large firms in order to avoid the risks associated with legal battles that may follow. In the United States, the number of firms involved in patent conflicts, being sued by \"patent trolls\" (companies that are fully devoted to initiating legal battles against firms, mostly small ones, that are, presumably, violating intellectual property laws) grew by a factor of nine in the de cade that fol - lowed 2004 (figure 4-10). Research suggests that firms that have been sued 124 productive equity on the basis of intellectual property violation by patent trolls reduce their R&D investment and get less external funding following the episode (Bessen 2014). It is clear how complicated the system of intellectual property protec - tion can be. Without proper protection of intellectual property, there is underinvestment in R&D, but abuse of the system can make adoption of existing technologies legally problematic and costly. Some authors have suggested rethinking the patenting system to deal with pos si ble frictions faced by small firms when adopting innovations in the industry (Baily and Montalbano 2016). A more efficient patenting system, which allows small firms to adopt technologies without risking losing all their capital in legal battles, could fuel productivity growth. When it comes to investing in KBC more broadly, credit constraints and access to finance have played a role in slower intangible investment growth and productivity. Firms that face credit crunches tend to respond by cutting nonessential expenses, and R&D investment is typically one of them. In fact, tighter credit conditions after the 2008 financial crisis played a role in reducing financially vulnerable firms' investment in intangible assets. An IMF study found that firms with weaker balance sheets (higher Source: Bessen (2014).500 01,0001,5002,0002,5003,0003,5004,0004,500 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012FIGURE 4-10 Rise of Patent Trolls: Number of Unique Defendants in Patent Troll Lawsuits The Technology-Productivity Paradox 125 leverage and greater short- term external financing needs) reduced their investment rate (as a share of total value added) by 0.5 percentage points more than less financially vulnerable firms. In countries where credit con - ditions tightened even more, the difference increases to 0.8 percentage points (figure 4-11). Furthermore, having the ability or incentive to invest in knowledge is one thing, and having the capability and knowledge to effectively use that knowledge is another. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that, in the United States, lagging sectors are less than 15 percent as digi - talized as the leading sectors, but the report finds that this gap has less to do with investment in IT equipment than it does with the ability of firms to engage digitally with their suppliers and customers (McKinsey Global Institute 2015a). This kind of engagement encompasses digital payments, advertising, or interactions on social media and in virtual marketplaces. The gap is, therefore, more a result of know-how in using digital technology than in having digital technology. Developing an effective digital engage - ment strategy often requires training, new business pro cesses, a branding strategy, new designs, and other forms of knowledge- based capital\u2014 the kind that laggard firms could benefit from.Source: IMF (2017).Difference between 2002-07 and 2008-13 average, percentage points High vs. low leverageHigh vs. low rollover risk0.10.51.01.52.02.53.0TFP growth, post-crisis slowdown Post-crisis decline in intangible investment rate 0.20.30.40.50.60.70.8 High vs. low leverageHigh vs. low rollover risk In median country In country where credit conditions deteriorated moreFIGURE 4-11 Impact of Tight Credit Conditions on Post- Crisis TFP Growth and Intangible Investment126 productive equity Putting the Focus on Competition During almost a century since the early 1880s, the iron ore mines of Min - nesota were the main supplier of iron ore to the American steel industry located mainly in the Great Lakes area. There was one reason for this: other iron ore producers in other locations, such as Brazil and Australia, could not compete with American miners given the high transportation costs. But this changed in the early 1980s when Brazilian producers began delivering iron ore to steel producers in the United States at lower prices than Min - nesota could manage. Unexpectedly for the American iron ore producers, competition had arrived. In response to increased competition, the iron ore industry in the United States underwent impor tant changes that led it to increase its productiv - ity.6 After being unchanged for de cades, iron ore producers doubled their productivity within five years following the arrival of competitors. Cap - ital and material productivity increased as well (for example, the efficiency with which producers use machines and materials, respectively). These improvements came mostly as a result of a relaxation of work practices that had been in place for de cades and had led to overstaffing and the underuse of machinery in significant amounts. These changes, which allowed the American iron ore industry to thrive, were not necessarily innovative on their own, but rather an adoption of best practices from other firms in the industry. It was competition that provided the incentives for these firms to adopt best practices to remain relevant by investing in orga nizational knowledge. The link between competition and firm productivity is widely estab - lished in the lit er a ture. With no competition, even if the firms have the ability to invest, they might not have the willingness to invest if there is little competition that threatens their profitability. Thus, competition incentiv - izes firms to invest in the adoption of new knowledge, whether by hiring better trained workers, acquiring new and more efficient physical capital like IT systems, or investing in orga nizational knowledge and best prac - tices. A recent study by researchers at New York University concluded that one of the key forces explaining up to 80 percent of the recent decline in private investment in the United States is less competitive markets (Guti - errez and Philippon 2017). The Technology-Productivity Paradox 127 Rising Market Power and Falling Competition Over the last two to three de cades, levels of competition have been declin - ing across a range of industries. First, rising levels of market concentration suggest that mono poly power is rising across industries (figure 4-12). In the United States, the market share of the fifty largest companies increased in three- fourths of broad industry groups between 1997 and 2007. The market share of the top four firms in six broad sectors (manufacturing, finance, ser - vices, utilities, retail, and wholesale) increased by 4 percent to 15 percent between 1982 and 2012 (Autor and others 2017). Rising market concentration by itself, however, is not enough to con - clude a decline in competition. For example, consider an industry protected by regulations that block the entry of large, highly productive firms\u2014 like some towns blocking Walmart to protect local businesses. Suppose this entry barrier is suddenly removed, and the large firm enters the market and forces the other small, less productive firms to close because they cannot compete with the more productive firm's low prices (a classic example of the Darwinian se lection pro cess). We now have a situation where the elim - ination of an entry barrier made the market more competitive, but the Sources: OECD (2016); Grullon, Larkin, and Michaely (2017).

Note that the competitiveness of the big firm came from its ability to lower prices, thanks to its scale and higher productivity, enough that smaller firms would be unable to compete and would be forced to exit the market. Over the last few de cades, however, it has not been the case that prices and profit margins have declined as one would expect with stronger com - petition. In fact, price markups have been growing and corporate profits have been rising at rec ord rates. Price markups, the difference between the price and the cost of a product, have grown while costs have generally de - clined with lower costs of labor and more globalized supply chains. For the thirty years between 1950 and 1980, U.S. firms' markups of prices over costs had been roughly stable. Since then, however, they increased from 18 percent in 1980 to 67 percent in 2014 (De Loecker and Eeckhout 2017). Across all global corporations, profits have more than tripled, from $2 trillion in 1980 (7.6 percent of world GDP) to $7.2 trillion in 2013 (9.8 percent of world GDP), with companies from advanced economies earning more than two- thirds of the total (McKinsey Global Institute 2015b).7 A University of Chicago study finds that rising markups and profits in the United States have been most pronounced in industries with large increases in market concentration (Barkai 2016). The study finds that the declining labor share of income that has been under way in the United States since the early 2000s does not necessarily mean that the capital share has risen. After paying workers their salary, the remainder is usually considered the capital share of national income. The study, however, splits this capital share into two parts. The first is the returns from capital (what it calls the capital share), and the other part is the level of profits. This exercise revealed that the profit share of national income has risen from 2 percent in 1984 to 16 percent in 2014 in the United States, while both the capital and labor shares have fallen. The implication is that firms' profits are not coming from capital accumula - tion and returns on productive investments but from higher markups, re - duced competition, and increased barriers to entry. In those industries that have become most concentrated, the profit share has risen the most. Higher price markups and rec ord corporate profits suggest that the rise in concentration is indicative of weaker, not stronger, competition. The slowdown in business dynamism described earlier weakens competitive pressure coming from relatively fewer new entrants. Across the OECD, The Technology-Productivity Paradox 129 small firms accounted for around 20 percent of all firms in 2002. Over a de cade later, that share had fallen to just 12 percent. With less competitive pressure, the incentive for making costly productivity- enhancing invest - ments wanes. What Could Be Holding Back Competition? The weakening of competition overall is partly a result of the slow pace of pro- competition national reforms, the slowdown of international trade, winner- take- most dynamics taking hold especially in IT- intensive indus - tries, and a wave of industry consolidation. The slow pace of regulatory reforms in product and labor markets has helped weaken the competitive pressures on firms to make productivity- enhancing investments. Empirical studies by researchers at the OECD find that competition- promoting reforms in product markets tend to boost investment and capital intensity, which as we know can be a source of tech - nology adoption through capital- embodied technologies (figure 4-13). Other studies have shown that lower levels of competition resulting from outdated or in effec tive regulations has notably slowed down the diffusion of general- purpose IT technologies in continental Europe. Data on product market reforms (PMR) in ser vice industries reveal that the divergence between high- and low-productivity firms is greater where the pace of reform is slower. Across these sectors, up to half of the increase in the gap between high and low productivity may have been avoided with faster market liberalization in ser vices. The top panel of figure 4-13 shows the relatively faster pace of reforms in the telecommunications industry and the lower dispersion of firm productivity in that industry in comparison to the slower pace of reform and wider productivity gaps in other indus - tries (in the figure, lower value of the PMR indicator denote more reform\u2014 reduced restrictiveness of regulation). The bottom panel of the figure esti - mates by how much the pace of reforms actually contributed to the increased gap between high- and low-productivity firms across ser vices industries. Another plausible contributor to the overall slowdown in competition and productivity is the slowdown in international trade. Prior to 2012, world trade grew twice as fast as world GDP. Since then, it has barely kept pace. On one hand, higher levels of international trade can add pressure on firms to adopt technologies and best practices by simply promoting more FIGURE 4-13 Slowing Pace of Product Market Reforms in the OECD, 1998-2013 -8-6-4-2Change in PMR indicator (%) Change in TFP gap (%)Product market reforms (PMR) and productivity gaps 1234 Telecom Legal and accounting servicesTechnical services Change in TFP gap Change in PMR indicator Contribution of slower reforms to increase in TFP gap 1.7 1.01.41.7 1.72.3 2.32.43.83.9 1.02.03.04.05.0Percent Transport Energy Retail Legal and accounting servicesTechnical services Increase in gap due to slow deregulation Observed increase in gap Source: Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal (2016). The Technology-Productivity Paradox 131 competition to local firms. But it goes beyond that. Often, intermediate inputs\u2014 through global value chains\u2014in the production pro cess play an impor tant role in the ability of firms to produce at lower costs. A growing body of evidence suggests that increased trade in intermediate inputs boosts productivity growth by increasing the variety of inputs or allowing firms to specialize in narrower and more defined tasks in the production pro cess.8 However, the slowdown in international trade since 2012 and the gen - eral maturation of global supply chains, or of China's deeper integration into the world trading system, could imply a slowdown in productivity gains from trade going forward. With less competitive pressure from foreign firms, either through import penetration where the pressure grows on do - mestic firms to innovate or through export penetration where domestic firms are competing at the global level, incentives for firms in tradable sec - tors to make productivity- enhancing investments chip away. More fundamentally, the nature of competition itself is changing with fast- growing digital platforms and rising ICT intensity across industries. In ser - vices industries with high levels of ICT intensity, there is a significantly larger productivity gap between leading and lagging firms than in other ser vices industries with low levels of ICT intensity (figure 4-14). This could reflect that the winner- take- most dynamics in these markets is changing competition and making it difficult for a broader range of small firms to compete. In markets with winner- take- most dynamics, massive scale is often re - quired to remain competitive. In an online marketplace, for example, where these properties are strongest, consumer choice is plentiful, and the ease of choosing one product over another often takes little more than a click of a mouse or the lure of a new network whose popularity has gone viral. In - deed, we see natu ral monopolies most clearly where there are network ef - fects. For example, Facebook owns 77 percent of mobile social traffic, Google has 88 percent of search advertising, and Amazon . com has a 74 percent market share in the e- book market (Foroohar 2017). More broadly, however, increased digitization has generated an explo - sion of data on consumer habits and preferences that firms are in a race to collect and own for competitive advantage. The more data a com pany has on a consumer, the more it can cross- sell customized and personalized ser - vices across traditional industry bound aries. Small firms are at an inherent disadvantage when data is owned by the larger firms that have the scale and IT infrastructure to collect it.Source: Andrews, Criscuolo, and Gal (2016).Log point difference (index) 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 20120.0 -0.20.20.40.60.8 Frontier firms LaggardsTop 10%Top point difference (index)TFP in ICT-intensive services 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 20120.00.20.40.60.8 Frontier firms LaggardsTop 10%Top 2%FIGURE 4-14 Higher TFP Dispersion in IT- Intensive Ser vices The Technology-Productivity Paradox 133 The large firms that have come to dominate these markets (as of April 2018, Google's parent com pany Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Mi - crosoft are the highest-valued publicly traded companies) have also created ecosystems where small firms can operate at lower costs but, ultimately, face high barriers to actually compete at scale. For example, Google and Amazon offer platforms and ser vices like cloud computing and open- source software that small firms can use to start-up at low cost and operate globally with video conferencing, code repositories, and mobile phones. Most large tech firms also offer financing and venture investing for start- ups and promising small firms (Varian 2016). In these ecosystems, however, small firms are reliant on the large providers that may have seats on their boards or acquire them should they develop a capability that would allow them to expand their reach, or if they become a competitive threat. In fact, a wave of mergers and acquisitions has consolidated a variety of industries and contributed to the rise in market concentration and di - vergence between high- and low-productivity firms. Some of these acquisi - tions have been by the large tech firms as they expand their reach, such as Facebook acquiring Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 and WhatsApp for $19 billion just two years later, which gave Facebook immediate scale in the messaging market (Rusli 2012; Kuchler and Bradshaw 2014). Perhaps the most notable example of large tech firms blurring industry bound - aries is the entrance of Amazon . com into the grocery market with its acquisition of Whole Foods in 2017 for $14 billion in 2017 (Turner, Wang, and Soper 2017). The scale of M&A activity in recent years is much larger than the activ - ity of a few firms, however, revealing the growing importance of size in re - maining competitive and securing a larger share of profits and stronger market power. In 1990, there were 11,500 M&A deals globally, with a com - bined value of 2 percent of world GDP. Between 2008 and 2014, there were around 30,000 deals each year, totaling roughly 3 percent of GDP. In 2015 alone the value of M&A deals exceeded $5 trillion, the highest amount in any year on rec ord. Thirty- seven percent of the value of these consolida - tions surpassed $10 billion, almost double the average of 21 percent in the five preceding years.9 Critics in the United States, where about half of the $5 trillion in global M&A deals took place, suggest lax antitrust enforcement due to shifts in po liti cal priorities, shrinking fiscal bud gets, or insufficient capacity to 134 productive equity investigate a rising number of transactions has facilitated the size and fre - quency of successful mergers. The under lying issue of the changing nature of competition in the digital age looms large over antitrust and competi - tion policy more broadly. Taking Stock The wide gap between high- and low-productivity firms points to a central feature of the productivity paradox\u2014 small firms' lack of adoption of productivity- enhancing technologies. A broad range of evidence comes together to suggest that this lack of adoption could be the result of under - investment in the tangible and intangible inputs to adoption. This under - investment is largely a result of reduced incentives from lower competition and of growing frictions in the supply of the inputs themselves. It is difficult to decisively point to a single source driving the underin - vestment in technology adoption. Declining competitive pressures\u2014as seen by fewer start- ups, rising market concentration, rising markups, and fewer small productive firms growing into large firms\u2014 suggest reduced incentives for small firms to make costly productivity- enhancing investments. On one hand, incumbents can focus on protecting their market power and on raising prices. On the other hand, smaller and newer firms are finding it difficult to justify costly investments if their chances to make a decent re - turn or gain market share are low. More competition could, therefore, play an impor tant role in encouraging some firms to invest in their productiv - ity. Some policy levers include public- private risk-sharing efforts in R&D investments and other forms of knowledge (including workforce training), a restructuring of the patenting system, smart antitrust enforcement, faster product market reforms, and a new framework for competition policy in winner- take- most markets. Frictions in the supply and access to the key inputs of technology adop - tion also contribute to the observed underinvestment by small firms. While financing constraints after the global financial crisis in 2008 have persisted for many years and constrained the ability of some small firms to raise cap - ital, evidence suggests there are also constraints in what they can actually invest in. Most notable is the slowing growth in the supply of human capi - tal and the observed tendency for highly skilled workers to cluster among The Technology-Productivity Paradox 135 high-productivity firms, making it harder for smaller firms to hire and keep these workers. This is especially impor tant given the growing role of intangible and knowledge- based capital in firm productivity. At the na - tional level, greater or more effective investments in infrastructure, educa - tion, and R&D could play a significant role in ensuring that access to quality inputs are available to a broad range of firms in an ecosystem of innova - tion, adoption, and knowledge. Notes 1. An impor tant caveat, however, is that there is a limitation to R&D data; it only captures some of what economists would consider research. For example, in the United States, 70 percent of mea sured R&D happens in the manufacturing industry, while some big companies, like Walmart and Goldman Sachs, report doing zero R&D (Jones 2015, Wolfe 2014). 2. A rapid increase in the number of domestic and foreign patents granted by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office began in the 1980s, but a significant portion of that increase can be explained by new legislation that extends patent protection to business models and software as well as changes in the judicial appeals pro cess for patent cases (Jaffe and Lerner 2006). 3. Respondents to this point show that, prior to 2000, declining firm entry rates were predominantly driven by retail and ser vices sectors, where the shift from small establishments to fewer large firms who took advantage of IT and globalization ac - counts for the rise in U.S. productivity in the late 1990s and the concurrent decline in business dynamism. Meanwhile, the high tech sectors were experiencing an in - crease in business dynamism until 2000, when start-up rates and the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) began to slow down (Decker and others 2016). 4. Some variation exists across countries. For example, spreads in the United States and United Kingdom have declined since 2007 where credit has tightened through other channels. 5. Cette, Fernald, and Mojon (2016) cite several studies. 6. See Schmitz (2005) for a comprehensive study of this episode. 7. Profits before interest and taxes. 8. Amiti and Konings (2007) use plant level data from Indonesia to find that the productivity effects of a reduction in tariffs on intermediate inputs were twice as large as a reduction in tariffs on final goods. Goldberg and others (2008) find productivity gains in India from reduced tariffs on intermediate goods, which increased input variety, and Ge and others (2011) find similar results for China. From Kowalski and Buge (2013). 9. As pointed out in a report by the U.S. Council of Economic Advisors in 2016, waves of mergers and acquisition tend to occur when stock market valuations are 136 productive equity high, and between 2010 and 2015 the stock market valuation of the S&P 500 index on the New York Stock Exchange increased by almost 60 percent. This suggests that the added intensity of M&A activity in recent years may have been exacerbated by cyclical factors, but nevertheless markets will remain consolidated, all else equal.

ZIA QURESHI Previous chapters have documented the slowdown in productivity growth and the concurrent rise in income in equality in most advanced economies, as well as in many major emerging economies, over the past two to three de cades. The previous chapter explored factors that help explain the para - dox of slowing productivity growth in a period when technology seems to have been booming. This chapter seeks to understand the causes of the rise in income in equality within countries, based on a synthesis of recent and ongoing research. Specific factors affecting income distribution differ from country to country, of course; the aim here is to identify and evaluate key factors that have been at play more or less broadly across countries. The focus in this chapter is more on advanced economies, which have seen larger and more consistent increases in in equality in recent de cades, but several of the factors discussed are relevant in varying degrees to the rise in in - equality occurring in some major emerging economies. A theme that runs through the chapter is the interconnectedness of the productivity slowdown and the rise in income in equality. There is a growing body of recent research that suggests impor tant common foundations, policy developments, and linkages connecting these two trends, with tech - nological change playing a key crosscutting role (OECD 2016a, 2017a). 142 productive equity This research points to a nexus between technological change and the pro - ductivity and distributional dynamics. Not only can higher in equality en - tail adverse consequences for longer- term growth, as research over the past couple of de cades has increasingly shown, but rising in equality and slow - ing productivity\u2014 the main driver of longer- term growth\u2014 may be linked by common causes . Globalization, Technology, or Policies It is commonplace to see the debate on the causes of rising in equality, es - pecially in advanced economies, couched in a binary way: globalization or technology. While the simplicity of this question is appealing, this fram - ing is misleading. The real ity is much more complex. Globalization and technological change have, indeed, been two major global forces affecting how gains from economic growth have been shared over the past two to three de cades. But there also have been impor tant policy and institutional factors that have affected distributional outcomes, including influencing how potential distributional impacts of globalization and technological change actually play out in specific country contexts. The period since the 1980s, when income in equality rose in most ad - vanced economies, also saw an acceleration in globalization. The increase in international trade integration was especially strong in the 1990s and 2000s until the growth in trade slowed in the wake of the global financial crisis and the ensuing recession. Globally, the ratio of exports plus imports of goods and ser vices to GDP rose from 39 percent to 61 percent between 1991 and 2008 (figure 5-1, left panel), a period characterized as one of hy - perglobalization (Subramanian and Kessler 2013). Financial globalization also advanced rapidly over this period as international capital flows, both cross- border direct investment and bank lending and portfolio investment, surged (figure 5-1, right panel). The expansion of international trade and investment has been an impor - tant engine for economic pro gress in both advanced and emerging econo - mies, spurring efficiency and productivity and creating new markets and opportunities for growth. In emerging economies, globalization, comple - mented by a pick-up in domestic policy reforms, helped launch a period of accelerating growth that saw incomes in these economies begin to converge Rising Inequality 143 on incomes in advanced economies. It generated significant positive net economic benefits for both groups of economies while also contributing to some reduction of the high- income inequalities between them. The gains from globalization, however, have not been distributed evenly within countries. As national income inequalities rose, an active debate de - veloped on the role of globalization as a responsible factor. This debate has featured both analyses by prominent economists (for example, Stiglitz 2002, Krugman 2008, Bourguignon 2015, Maskin 2015, Milanovic 2016, Rodrik 2017) and a contentious discourse in the po liti cal domain. Perceived con - cerns about the impact of globalization on in equality have given rise to a populist backlash against international trade in many countries in recent years. A challenge in evaluating the impact of globalization on income in - equality is the difficulty of disentangling its effects from other factors, nota - bly technology. Globalization and technology are intertwined. Globalization owes much to innovations in transportation, information, and communi - cation technologies that made more international commerce in goods and ser vices pos si ble; and globalization acts both as a spur to technological change and a conduit for its wider dissemination. For example, offshoring of some of a firm's pro cesses and ser vices owes much to advances in informa - tion and communication technologies. Increased competition from trade with low- wage countries might push firms to innovate and automate pro - duction pro cesses (Bloom and others 2016).15202530Exports and imports, 1960-2015 (% of GDP)External assets and liabilities, 1980-2015 (% of GDP) 1960196619721978198419901996200220082014100150200250300350400 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015FIGURE 5-1 Globalization: Trade and Finance Source: World Bank and IMF data.144 productive equity Notwithstanding these challenges, researchers have attempted to assess the impact of globalization on in equality. On balance, research shows that globalization has contributed to the rise in in equality in advanced econo - mies, but overall its role has been limited relative to the more pervasive role of technological change and developments in national economic policies (Dabla- Norris and others 2015, Obstfeld 2016, Helpman 2016, IMF 2017a, OECD 2017b). In advanced economies, trade integration put downward pressure on wages, particularly of lower- skilled workers, contributing to a rise in wage in equality and loss of labor share in national income (Autor and others 2013a, Geishecker and G\u00f6rg 2013, Ebenstein and others 2014). This effect became stronger in recent de cades, as not only did trade integration pick up pace but the nature of trade also changed. An increasing proportion of imports in advanced economies originated in developing economies with average income and wage levels well below those of advanced economies, in contrast to earlier de cades when trade expansion largely took the form of increases in intra- industry flows between economies at roughly similar levels of development (figure 5-2). Offshoring and outsourcing expanded trade channels. Unevenness in the sharing of rewards from financial glo - balization added to pressures pushing national income inequalities higher (Furceri and Loungani 2015). However, a much stronger force raising the premium on higher- level skills and increasing wage in equality in advanced economies appears to have been skill- biased technological change, such as automation and digi - tization that favored higher- skill workers. Although the industrial and oc - cupational composition of employment did shift toward more skill- intensive sectors, much of the increase in relative demand for higher- skilled work - ers, and associated rise in wage in equality, took place within sectors and industries rather than between them (Autor and others 2015a). Moreover, income and wage inequalities tended to increase in many of the exporting developing economies as well. For example, wage and income inequalities rose in both the United States, a major importer of low- skill manufactured products, and China, a major exporter of those products. These develop - ments contradict the predictions of the standard trade theory about the dis - tributional effects of trade.1 To be sure, trade may still be a factor explaining part of the increase in relative demand for skilled labor and the rise in wage in equality broadly Rising Inequality 145 across industries and groups of countries. Exporting firms within industries typically employ more skilled labor than other firms. Trade can contribute to higher skill premia and wage in equality between firms within industries, and in both advanced and developing countries, through two channels: se lection of firms with higher technology and skill levels\u2014 and higher productivity\u2014 into exporting; and access of exporting firms to a larger, global market size (Baumgarten 2013, Sampson 2014, Helpman and others 2017). Research finds that foreign investment can have similar effects by raising the premium on higher- level skills\u2014 and possibly also returns to capital (Chari and others 2012, Jaumotte and others 2013). Offshore outsourc - ing can also have the effect of raising skill premia everywhere (Feenstra and Hanson 2003). Nonetheless, research points to a more dominant role for skill- biased technological change in causing wage inequalities to rise. Moreover, it is not only the pattern of the rise in wage inequalities that suggests that factors other than growth in trade have been at play. The share of labor in national income fell not only in most advanced economies but in many emerging economies as well, with much of the fall reflecting declines within industries Source: Subramanian and Kessler (2013).United StatesJapanEuropean Union 5060708090100110 1980 1982 1984 1986 1988 1990 1992 1994 1996 1998 2000 2002 2004 2006 2008Income level of exporters relative to own income level (%)FIGURE 5-2 Relative Income Level of Exporters to EU, Japan, and United States, 1980-2010146 productive equity rather than shifts from high- labor- share industries to those with lower labor shares. The labor share fell in traded sectors but in many non- traded sectors as well (Autor and others 2017a, IMF 2017a). While the share of cap - ital in national income rose, its distribution also became more unequal, similar to the rise in labor income inequalities. These developments point to a mix of factors besides trade contributing to the rise in income in equality, notably technological change and but also national economic policies and institutions that affect growth and distributional outcomes. Globalization and technological change boost economic pro gress but in - evitably have di ff er ent impacts on di ff er ent segments of economies and workforce. The distributional outcomes, however, are not preordained. Much depends on how these pro cesses are managed (Tyson and Spence 2017). The role of policies is impor tant, both in cushioning the impact on workers who face job loss or skill devaluation and in preparing them for new jobs. Such policy response has been lacking. The following sections look further into the interplay of vari ous factors causing the rise in income in - equality within countries, setting the stage for later chapters on how poli - cies should respond to achieve more inclusive growth outcomes. Technology, Skills, and Market Conditions The mix of technological change, shifts in the demand for skills and gaps in supply, and market conditions as influenced by policies has been a key crosscutting factor impacting the evolution of both productivity and in - come in equality. Widening Productivity and Wage Gaps How technological innovation diffuses within economies and interacts with labor skills and market conditions has impor tant implications for income distribution (Comin and Mestieri 2013, Aghion and others 2015, OECD 2016a). We saw in the previous chapter that the slowdown in aggregate pro - ductivity growth in major economies reflected a widening divergence in productivity per for mance between firms. Productivity growth remained fairly robust in a relatively small number of firms at the technological fron - tier but slowed considerably in the vast majority of other firms, suggesting Rising Inequality 147 that the benefits of new technologies were not diffusing broadly across econ - omies. Wage trends show a similar pattern, with widening wage gaps be - tween more and less productive firms (figure 5-3). Across OECD countries, in equality in firm productivity per for mance is closely correlated with wage in equality, with countries experiencing higher dispersion in productivity between firms also experiencing higher dispersion in wages (figure 5-4). Increased productivity divergence across firms appears to have contributed not only to a slowing of overall produc - tivity growth but also to a rise in in equality in labor incomes. This suggests that promoting a broader diffusion of technological innovations and im - proving the productivity of lagging firms would both boost aggregate pro - ductivity growth and lower wage in equality.Source: OECD (2017b).

For ex - ample, in the United States, wage in equality increased sharply between 1982 and 2013 (figure 5-5, top panel). However, except at the very top of the wage distribution, the rise in wage in equality was driven predominantly by in - creased disparities in wages between firms rather than within firms (fig - ure 5-5, bottom panel).2 Average wages in the most profitable firms rose, while those in the rest of the firms tended to stagnate. Moreover, the increased wage disparities between firms stemmed, for the most part, from increased dispersion within industries rather than between industries\u2014 mirroring the increase in productivity dispersion that has also been driven largely by dif - ferentials within industries rather than between industries (Barth and others 2014, Song and others 2015). Similar results have been found for Brazil (Helpman and others 2017), Germany (Card and others 2013), Italy (Card Source: OECD (2016b).

Public debate on rising income in equality has tended to focus predom - inantly on the top 1 percent versus the rest\u2014 CEOs, super man ag ers, and top professionals versus other workers. Steep increases in incomes at the very top have, indeed, been an impor tant factor. However, a large part of the rise in earnings in equality is linked to widening wage gaps more broadly across the workforce and, particularly, between more and less suc - cessful firms. Wage differentials between firms driven by productivity differentials linked to uneven gains from new technologies were accentuated by the complementarity between the new technologies and worker skills. The revolution in information and communication technologies has increased the positive assortative matching between technology and skills, and be - tween higher- level skills, resulting in higher- skilled workers flocking to more technologically sophisticated and skill- intensive firms that are more productive and profitable (Kremer and Maskin 1996, Dunne and others 2004, Bagger and others 2013, OECD 2017a). While skill- skill and skill- technology- capital matching and consequent skill segregation across firms appears to have occurred broadly across economies, it appears to have been stronger in the technology and finance sectors, producing even sharper earnings differentials. Between- firm wage in equality has grown more in industries that invest more intensively in information and communication technologies (Bloom 2017). In addition to such skill sorting across firms, rent sharing has contrib - uted to increasing wage differences between firms. Better- performing firms increasingly reaped a higher proportion of total profits and shared a part of their supernormal profits with their workers (Bagger and others 2014, Card and others 2014). Increased fissuring of the workplace through out - sourcing added to the clustering of high- skill workers in high- paying firms and the increase in their rewards, with non- core activities typically employ - ing low- skill workers being farmed out to other firms, cutting such workers from the rent sharing (Goldschmidt and Schmieder 2015). Labor market frictions also played a role in the rise and per sis tence of between- firm wage differentials, especially in markets with less flexible labor markets (David - son and others 2008, Helpman and others 2010). Rising Inequality 151 Shift in Income from Labor to Capital Workers employed in firms at the technological frontier earned more than those in other firms, but gains from higher productivity at these firms were unevenly shared, with wage growth lagging labor productivity growth. Fig - ure 5-3 shows this pattern for OECD economies. Wages rose in the better- performing firms but by appreciably less than the rise in productivity. For most other firms, limited wage growth in large part mirrored limited pro - ductivity growth, although even at these firms wage growth tended to fall short of the relatively meager gains in productivity. The decoupling of wages from productivity has contributed to a steady decline in the share of labor in total income. Most OECD economies experienced both increasing in equality of labor earnings and declining labor income shares over the past two de - cades (figure 5-6). Over several preceding de cades, the labor income share had been relatively stable, consistent with Kaldor's stylized facts (Kaldor 1957). In the United States, the labor share of income dropped from the mid-60s around 2000 to the mid-50s around 2015 (Shambaugh and others 2017). U.S. productivity and wages began to diverge increasingly after the 1970s, having grown closely together in much of the post- war period. Be - tween 1973 and 2014, net labor productivity grew 72 percent while real hourly compensation of the median worker rose just 9 percent (Bivens and Mishel 2015). This shift of income from labor to capital increased in - equality, as capital owner ship is highly uneven. Indeed, in most advanced economies, the labor income share has been trending down since around 1980 (figure 5-7).3 Data are more limited for emerging and developing economies, but in a majority of them\u2014 especially the larger economies in this group\u2014 labor income shares have also declined since the early 1990s (IMF 2017a). Analysts have identified a range of causes for the decline in the labor income share: international trade and offshoring (Elsby and others 2013, Basu 2016); labor- substituting (Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014, Autor and Salomons 2018); slowdown in productivity growth (Grossman and others 2017); cap i tal ist forces that make wealth and capital income grow faster than economic output (Piketty 2014); increase in prod - uct market concentration and weakening of competition (Autor and others Source: Schwellnus and others (2017). Note: Data are unweighted averages of twenty- four OECD countries. Decoupling between labor productivity and average compensation reflects declines in labor income share. The gap between average and median compensation is a partial mea sure of wage in equality.125 120 115 110 19951995 = 100 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011100105 Productivity Real average compensatio n Wage inequality Labor share Real median compensationFIGURE 5-6 Decoupling of Wages, Labor Income Share, and Wage Inequality: OECD Countries, 1995-2013 FIGURE 5-7 Labor Share of Income: Advanced and Emerging Economies, 1980-2014 Self-employment and depreciation adjusted labor share Self-employment adjusted labor share Unadjusted labor share 50 455560657075 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015PercentAdvanced economies 40 3050607080 1994 1999 2004 2009 2014Percen tEmerging and developing economies Source: IMF (2017a). Rising Inequality 153 2017a); and changes in labor market institutions such as a decline in unionization (Jaumotte and Buitron 2015). For advanced economies, the research findings, on balance, point to technological change to have been the dominant factor behind the decline in labor income shares (IMF 2017a). For emerging economies, the findings pres ent a more mixed picture about the relative roles of di ff er ent factors, with trade (and in par tic u lar participation in global value chains) on aver - age playing a stronger role than in advanced economies.4 An impor tant focus of recent research, much of it covering advanced economies, has been the role of the interplay of new technologies with mar - ket conditions\u2014 competition, policies, and institutions\u2014in shifting income from labor to capital as well as producing more skewed distributions within both labor income and capital income. As discussed below, the interplay of these forces affected both productivity and distributional outcomes. Widening Gaps in Returns to Capital and Rise of Rents Market concentration has risen in most industries in advanced econo - mies. The rise is particularly marked in the United States. The share of the top four companies in total sales increased in all of the six sectors of the U.S. economy, shown in figure 5-8, with the increase being largest in retail trade and finance. Other statistics corroborate this evidence. In fi - nancial ser vices, the loan market share of the top ten banks increased from 30 percent to 54 percent between 1980 and 2012. Wireless providers saw increased concentration, with the average Herfindahl- Hirschman Index (HHI) increasing from under 2,500 in 2004 to over 3,000 in 2014.5 In the airline industry, four carriers now collect 65 percent of total reve - nue, up from 41 percent ten years ago. Four brewers now hold nearly 90 percent of the beer market (Wessel 2018). Business dynamism, as indi - cated by firm entry and exit, has declined. In 1982, young firms (five years old or less) accounted for about half of all firms and one- fifth of total employment; by 2013, these figures had fallen to about one- third and one- tenth, respectively (CEA 2016a, Decker and others 2016, 2017). The prevalence of \"zombie firms\" has increased (Adalet McGowan and others 2017). As market concentration increased, the distribution of returns to capital became more unequal. In the United States, available data for non-financial 154 productive equity firms show that the return on invested capital has diverged sharply across firms, with the typical firm seeing only a modest increase in return but a relatively small number of firms seeing large increases (figure 5-9). The 90th percentile firm earns a return on capital that is more than five times the median; this ratio was around two about twenty- five years ago. Returns on capital rose to supernormal levels at the top end of the distribution, reaching around 100 percent at the 90th percentile\u2014 and around 35 percent even at the 75th percentile. Among nonfinancial firms, the uneven distri - bution of returns to capital was evident broadly across industries, but it was particularly marked in technology industries and also in some other in - dustries, including health and housing. Data under lying figure 5-9 also reveal relatively low churning among high- return firms, with a large pro - portion of such firms per sis tently achieving high rates of return. These trends suggest shifts in markets toward oligopolistic structures and a rise in economic rents. The rise of superstar firms in part reflects the nature of digital technologies that can produce winner- takes- most out - comes and a highly concentrated power- law distribution of returns to digi - tal capital (Gabaix and Landier 2008, Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014, Autor FIGURE 5-8 Change in Sales Concentration of Top Four Companies: United States, 1982-2012 10203040 Manufacturing Finance Services Utilities Retail Wholesale 1982 2012Percent Source: Autor and others (2017b). Note: Figure shows the share of total sector sales accounted for by the top four firms in the sector. Rising Inequality 155 and others 2017a). Goods and ser vices that are intensive users of ICT and have high up-front fixed costs but low marginal costs offer large economies of scale and outsize rewards to successful firms. Strong network effects of products using digital technologies, such as software platforms and online ser vices, and the advantages of big data reinforce these scale economies. The combination of digital technologies and globalization facilitates the scaling up of success to the global level.6 Moreover, the new technologies increase consumer sensitivity to price and quality differences by greatly easing access to information. Firms controlling large consumer data can use sophisti - cated pricing algorithms and customized offerings to capture more of the consumer surplus. The rise of superstar firms and the related increase in product market concentration is more pronounced in higher- tech indus - tries, as mea sured by the intensity of industry investment in digital technolo - gies (Bessen 2017). Technology giants such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google are examples of such superstar firms.Source: Furman and Orszag (2015) and McKinsey & Com pany.

But this has not been the case; overall productiv - ity growth has tended to be slower in industries with wider divergence in per for mance between top firms and other firms, indicating that growth in lagging firms has been very weak. Research on OECD countries finds that the winner- takes- most feature of the new technologies is not solely to blame for these unequal outcomes; decreased competition in markets has pre - vented the fruits of technical pro gress to be more broadly shared, allowing dominant firms to protect their advantages. The gap in per for mance be - tween leading and lagging firms is greater in industries with less competi - tion (Andrews and others 2016). Industries marked by weaker technology diffusion across firms (as mea sured, for example, by patent citations) have experienced larger increases in product market concentration (Autor and others 2017a). Several factors appear to have contributed to a weakening of competi - tion: flaws in the patent system; regulation and licensing restricting com - petition; increased consolidation through mergers and acquisitions; lax antitrust enforcement; deregulation unsupported by competition policy safeguards; rise in overlapping corporate owner ship by large institutional investors; increased rent- seeking through translation of market power into po liti cal power; firm be hav ior showing increased adeptness in erecting bar - riers to entry through product differentiation and other means; and also creeping protectionism. Less competitive markets reduced pressures on firms to innovate. They also limited the diffusion of innovation and in - creased economic rents (Hacker and Pierson 2010, Baker 2015, Furman and Orszag 2015, Blonigen and Pierce 2016). A recent study for the United States estimated that reducing mono poly power, as reflected in high firm markups, could raise aggregate productivity by about 40 percent (Baqaee and Farhi 2017). Increased product market concentration impacted invest - ment as well, as decreased competition reduced incentives to make new investment (Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon 2016). Increased concentration of market power and prevalence of economic rents have not only contributed to inefficient outcomes\u2014 slower overall growth of productivity and investment\u2014 but also to more unequal distri - butional outcomes. Joseph Stiglitz (2012) finds the rise in mono poly power and economic rents as a leading cause of increased in equality in the United Rising Inequality 157 States. Research shows that industries with higher market concentration have lower shares of income going to labor. Not only has rising concentra - tion made the distribution of returns to capital more unequal, it has also shifted income from labor to capital by reallocating labor within industries to dominant firms with supernormal profits and lower labor income shares (Autor and others 2017b). The shift in income from labor to capital in the more concentrated in - dustries is, to a large extent, due to high markups and profits of the leading firms rather than increased investment and capital; companies are investing less and making a lot more on existing assets in less competitive markets. An increasing portion of the high corporate profits reflected mono poly power rather than productivity of investment (Barkai 2016, Eggertsson and others 2018).7 The average markup above marginal costs in publicly traded U.S. firms rose more than 350 percent between 1980 and 2014 (De Loecker and Eeckout 2017). Dominant firms not only acquired more mono poly power to set prices in product markets but also monopsony power to dictate wages in the labor market (CEA 2016b). Recent studies of the U.S. economy find that employer concentration in the labor market has increased and that higher labor market concentration is associated with lower wages (Azar and others 2017; Benmelech and others 2018). Research also finds a high degree of market power in digital labor markets\u2014 online jobs platforms such as Uber, Task Rabbit, and Amazon Mechanical Turk\u2014 that are an increasingly impor tant part of the \"gig\" economy (Dube and others 2018). Increased disparities in firm profitability also contributed to increased disparities in labor income as the most profitable firms paid their workers more, while most workers in lagging firms saw little growth in earnings. As noted earlier, the rise in wage in equality has been driven more by in - creased divergence in wages between firms than within firms. Widening Skill Gaps, Rising Skill Premia, and Job Polarization Shifts in income from labor to capital and increased disparities within labor and capital income have all contributed to the rise in overall income in equality. The largest part of the rise in income in equality is accounted for by an increasingly unequal distribution of labor income (Furman and Orszag 2015, Francese and Mulas- Granados 2015). New technologies, 158 productive equity notably digital technologies, increased the demand for higher- level skills that commanded high rewards in firms successfully exploiting the new technologies. The relative scarcity of the new skills increased wage differ - entials and also hindered a broader adoption and diffusion of the new technologies across firms.8 How the supply of skills responds to changes in the demand for skills caused by technological change\u2014 the race between education and tech - nology\u2014is a key determinant of wage structure (Goldin and Katz 2008, Acemoglu and Autor 2012). The premium on skills has risen sharply, and the rise was particularly sharp between 1980 and 2000.9 This is reflected in widening gaps between the earnings of college- educated workers and those with only a high school education (figure 5-10). The skill pre - mium for post- graduate education rose even more sharply. Skill premia rose across countries. Among OECD countries, they increased in all of FIGURE 5-10 Higher Education Earnings Premium: United States, 1979-2016 120140160180200 1979 1984 1989 1994 1999 2004 2009 2014Percent of high school graduates' hourly wage s Advanced degree premium Bachelor's degree premium Source: Shambaugh and others (2017). Note: Earnings premia are the ratios of median wages of each educational attainment group to median wages of those with a high school diploma only. Rising Inequality 159 them, with the increase being the largest in the United States, which stands out as having the highest premium on skills in this group of countries (Hanushek and others 2013, Autor 2014a). Some studies find that the increase in the education wage premium can account for between 55 percent to 70 percent of the rise in wage dispersion in the United States between the 1980s and the mid-2000s (Lemieux 2006, Goldin and Katz 2008). Both supply and demand factors explain the sharp rise in skill- based wage differentials. On the supply side, the rate of increase in educational attainment dropped. In the United States, growth in the years of education completed slowed considerably toward the end of the twentieth century. In - dividuals in the cohorts born between 1875 and 1950 completed 0.4 more years of education by age thirty on average than those born five years ago. Starting with those born after 1950, the rate slowed to just 0.2 years (figure 5-11). So for the cohorts reaching age thirty in 1980 and after, the pool of higher- skilled workers grew at a much slower pace. The slowing of the pace of improvement in educational attainment is observable more broadly across countries over this period; on average, such human capital FIGURE 5-11 Mean Years of Schooling Completed by Year of Birth: United States, 1876-1982 789101112131415 1876 1891 1906 1921 1936 1951 1966Mean years of schooling completed Year of Birth1951-82 trend1876-1951 trend Source: Furman (2016a), based on calculations by Goldin and Katz.160 productive equity accumulation slowed across both advanced and emerging economies (Barro and Lee 2013; Morrisson and Murtin 2013). Growth in the supply of higher- level skills slowed just when demand for them picked up. Digital technologies increased the demand for skills to work with computers, software, and more sophisticated pro cesses. They also began automating jobs of a routine nature, which are typically jobs in the middle of the skill- wage distribution performed by workers without post- secondary education, such as bookkeeping, clerical work, and repetitive production. These shifts in relative demand for di ff er ent skill levels pro - duced both rising wage in equality and rising job polarization. Across OECD countries, the employment share of middle- skill routine jobs fell while that of high- skill abstract jobs (technicians, professionals, man ag ers) and low- skill nonroutine manual jobs (mainly in ser vice occupa - tions such as personal care and food ser vices) rose (figure 5-12). Between 1995 and 2015, the share of middle- skilled workers in total employment de - clined by around 9 percentage points in these countries. Across advanced economies, the decline in the labor income share has been borne dispro - portionately by middle- skill workers (IMF 2017a). While international trade and offshoring have played a role in this job polarization (Keller and FIGURE 5-12 Job Polarization and Increase in Nonstandard Work: OECD Countries, 1995-2010 -20-15-10-505101520 Nonroutine manual Routine Abstract Standard work Nonstandard workPercentage change in employment share by task category Source: OECD (2016a). Note: Data cover twenty- three OECD countries. Rising Inequality 161 Utar 2016), the dominant factor has been technological change (OECD 2017b). A concurrent development has been the rise of the \"gig\" economy\u2014 nonstandard forms of work such as temporary or part- time contracts and own- account self- employment\u2014 especially at lower skill and wage levels. Across twenty- six OECD countries, between the mid-1990s and the onset of the global financial crisis, almost half of all job creation was in nonstan - dard work; including the post- crisis years up to 2013 brings the share to around 60 percent. In 2013, nonstandard work on average accounted for about a third of total employment in OECD countries (OECD 2015a). While imparting more flexibility to the labor market, nonstandard work also con - tributed to increased earnings in equality, as nonstandard jobs at low- skill levels typically carried much lower earnings than standard jobs. Employment growth in the United States shows a pattern similar to the U- shaped changes in employment shares by skill level seen broadly across OECD countries (figure 5-13), with the shares rising at the low and high ends of the skill distribution and falling in the middle. It also shows that the rise in employment share at higher skill levels began to flatten out after Source: Autor (2014b).

This suggests that the locus of job displacement started to move be - yond middle- level skills into the lower- end of higher- level skills. It also sug - gests a \"skill downgrading\" pro cess, with higher- skill workers, both new entrants and those displaced from routine jobs, increasingly moving into lower- skill, manual jobs, particularly in the ser vices economy (Autor and Dorn 2013b, Autor 2014b, Beaudry and others 2016). Also, similar to the general trend in OECD countries, the share of nonstandard work in total employment rose in the United States (Katz and Krueger 2016, McKinsey Global Institute 2016).10 The new technologies did not displace low- skill workers in nonroutine manual jobs (with their employment share, in fact, rising), but neither did they do much to boost their productivity and wages. The productivity and wage benefits of these technologies accrued mainly to high- skill workers, who were increasingly clustered in higher profitability firms at the techno - logical frontier. Changes in Labor Market Institutions Flexible labor markets, supported by adequate institutional frameworks, can foster labor mobility and job creation, contribute to higher productivity through better resource allocation, as well as promote inclusive distribu - tional outcomes. However, labor market developments in recent de cades in many cases appear to have delivered both less flexibility and less worker protection. Labor market dynamism has declined in many major economies in re - cent de cades, with workers less likely to move between jobs, industries, oc - cupations, and locations. In the United States, the decline is evident in both job creation and job destruction rates and in worker mobility between industries and occupations (figure 5-14). Some decline in labor fluidity may be due to better matching in job markets or increased efforts by firms to reduce employee turnover. But the decline also reflects barriers to labor mo - bility, with adverse implications for labor productivity and labor income distribution (Molloy and others 2016). Labor mobility declined at a time when shifts in the demand for skills caused by the new technologies called for more rather than less mobility.FIGURE 5-14 Labor Market Dynamism: United States Job creation and destruction, 1977-2013 Employer, occupation, and industry transitions, 1981-2013Job creation Job destruction 12 1014161820 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007 2012Rate (percent) 2 04681012 1981 1987 1993 1999 2005 2011Percent of total population age 16+ Employer change Occupation change Industry change Source: Furman (2016b) and Molloy and others (2016).164 productive equity One factor is the reduced business dynamism and increased market concentration in product markets noted in the previous section; an in - creasing proportion of workers were employed in older and larger firms that typically have lower job fluidity (Hyatt and Spletzer 2013, Davis and Haltiwanger 2014). Also, the rise of dominant firms making supernormal profits reduced worker incentives to leave firms earning high rents. An - other factor is regulatory barriers, which appear to have increased labor mar - ket frictions, including occupational licensing requirements, non- compete clauses in employment contracts, \"job lock\" from employer- sponsored health insurance, and land use/housing restrictions. The share of the U.S. workforce covered by occupational licensing laws increased from less than 5 percent in the early 1950s to 29 percent in 2008 (Kleiner and Krueger 2013, CEA 2016b). There has been a general decline across countries in the degree of labor unionization (figure 5-15). In the United States, the fraction of private- sector workers who belong to labor unions fell from around 25 percent in the mid-1970s to 7 percent in 2011 (Autor 2014a). The decline in unionization has been found, in several studies, to have contributed to recent trends toward lower labor income shares and higher wage in equality (Card and others 2004, Western and Rosenfeld 2011, Jaumotte and Buitron 2015, Machin 2016).FIGURE 5-15 Union Rate by Country Group, 1990-2012 1020304050607080Percent 1990 2012 1990 2010 1990 2010 1990 2011 1993 2010 Maximum Minimum MedianNordic CountriesEurope East Asia PacificEmerging MarketsNorth America Source: Dabla- Norris and others (2015). Rising Inequality 165 In addition to lower union density, decentralization of wage bargaining and lower employment protections have been found in some studies to have contributed to lower and unequal labor income outcomes (Dahl and others 2013, OECD 2017a). These developments in labor market institutions reduced workers' bargaining power at a time when the rise of dominant firms and increased market concentration strengthened the hand of employers in setting wages, including through greater opportunities to collude, explic itly or tacitly. A parallel development has been a weakening of minimum wage laws and their application, which affected especially the lowest earners, who are often the most vulnerable to employers' wage- setting power. Many coun - tries saw an erosion of minimum wages. In the United States, for example, the real value of the federal minimum wage declined by about 25 percent from its peak in 1968 to 2015 (figure 5-16). The erosion of the minimum wage contributed to increased in equality in labor income (Autor and others 2015b). Some U.S. states did provide larger increases in minimum wages, and recent research finds that the higher compensation did not come at the expense of employment (Card and Krueger 2016, Cengiz and others 2018). Similar findings linking minimum wage erosion to higher labor income in equality have been reported for several other OECD countries (OECD 2017a).Source: CEA (2016b).6.5 6.07.07.58.08.59.09.5 1970 1960 1980 1990 2000 20102015 dollars per hourFIGURE 5-16 Real Value of U.S. Federal Minimum Wage, 1960-2015166 productive equity Financialization Finance plays an impor tant role in economic growth, channeling savings to investment and balancing risk with reward. However, \"too much finance\" can hurt productivity and growth, fuel economic instability, and also in - crease income in equality (Cecchetti and Kharroubi 2012, Arcand and others 2015). In emerging economies at relatively low levels of financial develop - ment, financial deepening boosts growth and is likely to reduce in equality by broadening opportunity. In advanced economies with already well- developed financial systems, further large financial expansion can have the opposite effect. Starting from a high level of financial development, OECD economies experienced rapid further financialization in recent de - cades, with credit and other financial intermediation growing three times as fast as economic activity. OECD analy sis finds that this further finan - cialization slowed rather than boosted long- term economic growth, in - creased vulnerability to crises, and also contributed to rising income in equality (OECD 2015b). An increasing proportion of credit went to house holds rather than to firms and businesses, boosting stock and real estate markets rather than productive investment\u2014an allocation of credit with negative implications for growth, stability, and income distribution. In the United States, credit rose sharply relative to GDP in the lead-up to the global financial crisis of 2007-08, but this was concentrated predominantly in the house hold sector (figure 5-17). The credit boom was associated with a rising misallocation of capital in advanced economies more broadly (Adler and others 2017). When the boom burst with the financial crisis, it was not only the house hold sector that faced a correction; credit disruptions affected investment as well, par - ticularly by smaller firms (Anzoategui and others 2016). Research also finds that increasing corporate stock owner ship by finan - cial institutions, in par tic u lar, large institutional investors, shifted corporate decisionmaking toward short- termism, favoring short- term financial gains (such as through share repurchases) at the expense of longer- term invest - ment in innovation and new capacity (Asker and others 2015, Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon 2016, Erixon and Weigel 2016). Overlapping corporate owner ship by institutional investors may also have played a role in diluting competition (CEA 2016a, Azar and others 2018). Institutional investors now own more than two- thirds of the stock of U.S. publicly traded companies. Rising Inequality 167 Asset price bubbles inflated by the credit boom, decline in lending stan - dards, and overexposure of the financial sector played an impor tant role in causing the global financial crisis. The financial sector was at the center of the fault lines that underlay the crisis (Rajan 2010, Schularick and Tay - lor 2012). There was much innovation in finance based on the new information and communication technologies, including new financial products and business models. However, this did not translate into significant boosts to productivity, either in the economy at large because of misallocation of capi - tal or in the financial sector itself, as much of the innovation was concen - trated in areas such as trading that are unlikely to have first- order effects on productivity or welfare (Philippon 2016b).11 The shortcomings of the fi - nancial sector contributed to the paradox of rapid technological change but slowing productivity growth, as analyzed in the previous chapter. Rising finance contributed to increasing income in equality directly as earnings in the sector rose sharply relative to rest of the economy. The FIGURE 5-17 Distribution of Credit to Non-financial Sectors: United States, 1950-2013 20406080 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 Household credit Corporate credit Noncorporate creditPercent of GDP Source: Philippon (2016a).

In Eu - ro pean countries, on average, financial sector workers in 2010 accounted for one in five of the top 1 percent of earners even though they accounted for only one in twenty- five of the total workforce (Denk 2015). In the United States, the ratio of average wage in the financial sector to that in the private sector as a whole rose from less than 1.2 in 1980 to almost 1.9 just before the global financial crisis (figure 5-18). Over the twenty- five- year pe - riod to 2005, finance professionals accounted for a quarter of the increase in the share of national income going to the top 1 percent earners. Part of the higher rewards in finance reflected higher skills, illustrating positive assortative matching between technology and skills that has already been noted. Part reflected economic rents, as much as 30 percent to 50 percent, caused by a combination of market liberalization, lack of regula - tory oversight, and rent-seeking. The high rewards lured talent away from FIGURE 5-18 Financial Sector Relative Wage: United States, 1930-2013 1.2 1.11.31.41.51.61.71.81.9 1940 1930 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010Relative wage Source: Philippon (2016b).

Rising Inequality 169 sectors where it could have been more productively used (Philippon and Reshef 2012, Bakija and others 2012). The growth of finance also contributed to in equality indirectly, as its ser - vices disproportionately benefited upper-income groups who captured dom- inant shares of credit expansion and, even more so, the rewards from greater stock market capitalization. Stock market owner ship is yet more skewed than income distribution; in euro- area countries, for example, the top quintile receives close to 40 percent of national income but owns more than two- thirds of stocks (Denk and Cazenave- Lacroutz 2015). In the United States, in 2013, the top 1 percent of the wealth distribution held half of stock and mutual fund assets, and the top 10 percent held more than 90 percent of those assets (Wolff 2014). The richer house holds also hold higher- return products, enjoying average returns on wealth that are a multiple of those accruing to lower- income house holds (Fagereng and others 2016). Much of innovation in finance to date has gone into the design and provision of specialized products and ser vices tailored to rich house holds. The application of new digital technologies in finance, often referred to as FinTech, has the potential to improve financial ser vices more broadly for firms and house holds, but its realization will depend on appropriate policy choices and regulatory framework. Rising In equality of Opportunity In equality begets in equality if it is reflected not just in more unequal outcomes today but also more unequal distribution of opportunities for economic mobility. In equality can, therefore, persist and even be self- reinforcing. Cross- country evidence shows that countries with higher income in equality tend to have lower intergenerational income mobility. Figure 5-19, covering thirteen OECD countries, shows this negative rela - tionship between in equality and mobility in what has come to be known as the \" Great Gatsby Curve\" (Krueger 2012).12 High income in equality can be both a symptom and a cause of low economic mobility. High income in - equality produces still higher in equality of wealth, which adds to mobility challenges. In advanced economies, wealth in equality is, on average, twice as high as disposable income in equality. Recent de cades have seen sharp 170 productive equity increases in wealth relative to national income and in in equality of wealth owner ship. Research on the U.S. economy finds that intergenerational income mo - bility has declined as income in equality has risen. The proportion of children who earn more at age thirty than their parents did at the same age has fallen to about 50 percent for the cohort born in 1980; this proportion was as high as around 90 percent for the cohort born forty years earlier (figure 5-20, top panel). The largest decline in mobility has occurred for families in the middle of the income distribution (figure 5-20, bottom panel). This finding aligns with the decline of middle- skill jobs already discussed and the shrinkage of the middle class in many advanced economies noted in chapter 2. Rising income in equality emerges as the main reason for the decline in intergen - erational income mobility, explaining about 70 percent of the decline, with slower economic growth accounting for about 30 percent (Chetty and others 2016). So stronger growth alone will not restore mobility to previous levels; both stronger and more broad- based growth will be needed. In countries experiencing large increases in in equality, the consequences of the \"birth lottery\" (the parents to whom a child is born) have increased, and the playing field has become more tilted for the next generation.FIGURE 5-19 Income In equality and Economic Mobility: OECD Countries Sweden Finland Norway DenmarkGermany New Zealand CanadaAustraliaJapanFranceItalyUK USA 0.1 00.20.30.40.5 21 19 23 25 27 29 31 33Generational earnings elasticity (higher values imply lower mobility) Inequality (disposable household income Gini coefficient) Source: Corak (2013).FIGURE 5-20 Changes in Economic Mobility: United States 50 4060708090 1945 1950 1940 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 Year in which child is bornPercent of children earning more than parentsMean rate of absolute mobility by cohort Selected cohorts by parent income percentile 20406080 20 40 60 80 Parent income percentile1940 1950 1960 1970 1980Percent of children earning more than parents Source: Chetty and others (2016).172 productive equity Reduced opportunities for mobility because of higher income in equality can reflect a range of factors, but an impor tant one is disparities in access to education\u2014 the \" great equalizer.\"13 OECD studies have found that coun - tries with higher income in equality generally have lower enrollment ratios for upper- secondary education (OECD 2015a). As noted, the premium on education has risen as the supply of skills has lagged growth in demand re - sulting from skill- intensive technological change. Increased college earn - ings premia are associated with lower intergenerational income mobility (figure 5-21). When the premium on higher education is high, children of richer parents are doubly advantaged\u2014by their parents' income and, there - fore, better access to higher education, and by increased returns on educa - tional attainment. In the United States, even as pre- collegiate achievement gaps by family income have narrowed somewhat, gaps in college education have widened (Greenstone and others 2013, Turner 2017). While gains in college enroll - ment and completion have accrued across all family backgrounds, they have been much larger for those in higher- income quartiles (figure 5-22).

The corresponding completion rate gap increased from 31 percentage points to 45 percentage points. These raw differences do not factor in differences in the quality of college educa - tion across income groups; only 15 percent of college students with family incomes below $25K are in private or flagship public institutions (the re - mainder are in two- year community colleges and four- year open- access public institutions) compared to nearly 45 percent of those with family in - comes exceeding $125K (Turner 2017). While gaps in college educational attainment have widened, the consequences of these gaps are yet greater as market opportunities for those lacking higher- level and broad- based skills have eroded.

Despite much pro gress, a substantial digital divide persists even in advanced economies. Research finds that Internet use improves labor market outcomes but, in the United States, fewer than 50 percent of house holds in the bottom income quintile use the Internet at home, com - pared with 95 percent in the top quintile (CEA 2016c). A study of Eu ro pean countries found that 20 percent of individual users capture 60 percent of all consumer surplus from digital ser vices, while the bottom 50 percent cap - ture just 20 percent (Interactive Advertising Bureau Eu rope 2010). Afford - ability, access, and digital literacy explain the disparities in usage. Similar disparities exist among firms. Most sectors of the U.S. economy are less than 15 percent as digitalized as the leading sectors. Workers in the most digi - talized businesses enjoy wage growth that is twice the national average. Conversely, those without digital skills face narrowing job prospects (McKinsey Global Institute 2015). Weakening Redistributive Role of the State The foregoing discussion shows how the interplay of technological change, developments in product and labor markets, and related policies drove the rise in income in equality in major economies. Government taxes and transfers play an impor tant role in ameliorating the in equality of market incomes arising from the interplay of these forces. In advanced econo - mies, progressive taxes and transfers such as public pensions and social assistance benefits have reduced in equality by an average of close to one- third; the Gini coefficient for income after taxes and transfers (disposable income) is on average about two- thirds of that for market income in - equality (figure 5-23). The redistributive role of taxes and transfers varies across countries; it is stronger in Eu ro pean countries than in the United States. In emerging economies, tax and transfer policies typically play a smaller redistributive role than in advanced economies, reflecting lower average levels of both taxes and social transfers.14 The redistributive role of taxes and transfers in advanced economies has weakened in the last couple of de cades, with the result that fiscal pol - icy has been unable to counteract the rise in market income in equality and prevent sizable increases in disposable income in equality (Caminada and Rising Inequality 175 others 2012, Clements and others 2015, IMF 2017b). The redistributive impact of fiscal policy rose somewhat in the aftermath of the global financial crisis as spending on unemployment and other benefits increased because of automatic stabilizers and fiscal stimulus mea sures, but only temporar - ily, as countries soon shifted to fiscal consolidation even though still faced with a weak economic recovery (OECD 2015a). Among OECD countries, the Gini coefficient for market income rose substantially in the 1990s but that for disposable income rose much less. In the following de cade, how - ever, the Gini coefficients for market and disposable income increased about the same, although less than in the previous de cade (figure 5-24). Re distribution through taxes and transfers hardly offset any of the rise in market income in equality in the 2000s. The redistributive power of fiscal policy has declined as a result of re - duced marginal tax rates on higher incomes and lower taxes on capital, as well as tighter spending on social protection programs as many countries took steps to rein in fiscal deficits and rising public debt. Much of the rise in income in equality in advanced economies in recent de cades has been driven by an increasing concentration of income at the top. Reduced Source: OECD Income Distribution Database and OECD income GiniFIGURE versus Disposable Income Distribution: Selected Countries, Circa 2013176 productive equity progressivity of tax systems contributed to that outcome. In OECD coun - tries, the average top statutory personal income tax rate fell from 62 percent in 1981 to 35 percent in 2015 (figure 5-25). International tax competition encouraged by financial globalization and increased mobility of capital has contributed to a sharp decline in corpo - rate income tax rates as well. The average corporate income tax rate in ad - vanced economies fell from around 45 percent in 1990 to 26 percent in 2015 (IMF 2017b). In the United States, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered the corporate income tax from a top rate of 35 percent to a flat rate of 21 percent. Taxes on wealth, which can play a useful role in limiting inter - generational per sis tence of in equality, have also declined. Already at low levels in most countries, they have not kept pace with the surge in wealth relative to GDP and the rising in equality in wealth owner ship. Among OECD countries, the effective tax rate from vari ous taxes levied on wealth dropped from around 0.9 percent in 1970 to 0.5 percent in the early 2010s (Clements and others 2015). Effective tax progressivity is also undermined FIGURE 5-24 Redistributive Impact of Taxes and Transfers: OECD Countries 123 2000-11 Change in Gini coefficient income Source: OECD (2016b). Note: Data cover twenty- three OECD countries. Rising Inequality 177 by sizable tax avoidance and evasion from shifting capital income and as - sets to offshore tax havens. Taxes and transfers do not capture the entirety of the impact of fiscal policy on re distribution. Access to and cost of public ser vices, such as edu - cation and health, also have impor tant distributional consequences. In equality in a country that provides most education almost free for every - one is likely to be much lower than in equality in a country where most education must be paid for, even though their disposable income Gini co - efficients may be similar. The same goes for health. Spending on infrastruc - ture also matters, as it affects the cost and availability of infrastructure ser vices. The redistributive role of such in- kind benefits is particularly impor tant in emerging economies that, as noted, typically have lower lev - els of direct taxes and transfers than do advanced economies. For exam - ple, in- kind education and health benefits are estimated to reduce the Gini coefficient by an average of 5.8 percentage points in the United States and five Eu ro pean countries (Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, and the United Kingdom) compared with an average of almost 10 percentage points in Chile, Brazil, and South Africa.15 Like direct transfers, in- kind transfers have felt the pressure of fiscal consolidation efforts in recent years.

Conclusion In most major economies, productivity growth has slowed and income in equality has risen over the past couple of de cades. These trends have been particularly marked and protracted in advanced economies. The trends in productivity and in equality have been the subject of intense scrutiny by economists. Much of the analy sis has looked at them in isolation. More re - cently, however, analysts have explored pos si ble linkages between these trends. The foregoing review of research finds that the slowdown in pro - ductivity growth and the rise in in equality are interconnected. The chapter documents the impor tant common drivers behind the slow - ing productivity growth and rising in equality. These include: the weaken - ing diffusion of technological pro gress and widening gaps in productivity and profitability across firms; the erosion of competition, decline of busi - ness dynamism, and rise of economic rents; the shortcomings of rising fi - nance producing outcomes that were both inefficient and unequal; the lags in the supply of skills in adjusting to the shifts in demand caused by tech - nological change and the rising differentials in labor earnings; deficiencies in the functioning of labor markets; and the rising inequalities of oppor - tunity coupled with a weakening role of the state in offsetting those. These factors go a considerable way in helping to explain both the slowdown in productivity and the concurrent rise in in equality. Not only do slowing productivity and rising in equality have impor tant common causes, research also finds feedback loops and reinforcing mech - anisms between them. It finds that rising in equality reduces economic growth and undermines its sustainability (Berg and Ostry 2011, Cingano 2014, Kumhof and others 2015, Grigoli and Robles 2017).16 Higher in equality can weaken growth by depressing aggregate demand, but it can also have negative consequences for longer- term growth by hurting productivity, for example, by reducing the ability of lower- income groups to invest in edu - cation and skill- building. In equality arising from high economic rents also undermines efficiency and productivity (OECD 2015a).17 A complementary Rising Inequality 179 finding is that well- designed re distribution can be pro- growth (Ostry and others 2014). What are the implications of these findings for policy? One clear impli - cation is that policies to revive productivity growth and policies to reverse the rise in national income inequalities are interlinked. An integrated ap - proach is needed to address these challenges, harnessing synergies between policies as well as tackling potential conflicts. We turn to this policy agenda in the final two chapters. Notes 1. The Stolper- Samuelson theorem implies that trade between advanced and developing economies would shift the demand for labor toward skill- intensive activities in advanced economies and less skill- intensive activities in developing economies, raising relative wages of high- skilled workers and increasing wage in - equality in advanced economies and, conversely, raising relative wages of low- skilled workers and reducing wage in equality in developing economies (Stolper and Samuelson 1941). 2. In figure 5-5 (bottom panel), the black dotted line shows the log change in individual earnings arranged by earnings percentiles. The gray solid line arranges individuals in the same percentile groups as the black dotted line based on their own earnings but plots the log change in average earnings at firms where they worked. The gray dotted line plots, for the same percentiles, the change in indi - viduals' earnings relative to average earnings at their firms. This line is equal to the difference between the black dotted and gray solid lines. In all three cases, the change is mea sured between 1981 and 2013. The upward sloping black dotted and gray solid lines show roughly matching increases in in equality in earnings between individuals and in in equality in average earnings between firms where they worked. The largely flat gray dotted line shows that within- firm earnings in equality re - mained relatively unchanged, except at the very top of the earnings distribution. 3. In figure 5-7, the middle line shows labor income share adjusted for self- employment, which plays a larger role in emerging and developing economies. The top line includes an additional adjustment to show labor share in terms of income net of depreciation of capital. 4. The stronger impact of technology on labor income shares in advanced econ - omies relative to emerging economies reflects both greater technological change in the former group of economies (sharper declines in relative prices of investment goods) and higher elasticities of substitution between labor and capital, including higher exposure to automation of routine tasks. Participation in global value chains can have the effect of lowering labor income shares in emerging economies as the 180 productive equity tasks that are offshored are relatively capital intensive in the context of these econ - omies (IMF 2017a). 5. The HHI Index is a commonly used mea sure of market concentration. Anti - trust agencies generally consider markets in which HHI is between 1,500 and 2,500 to be moderately concentrated and markets with HHI higher than 2,500 to be highly concentrated. 6. Besides superstar firms , information and communication technologies and their global reach have increased the leverage of highly skilled individuals , such as top business and finance executives, artists, and athletes. 7. Another study covering G7 economies finds that the fall in labor's share of income is less due to a shift of income to productive capital and more to a shift to housing capital and land rents (Rognlie 2015). 8. Skill constraints dampened productivity growth through both slower growth in needed human capital (Adler and others 2017) and increase in skill mismatches (Adalet McGowan and Andrews 2015). 9. The rise in the higher education wage premium flattened after 2000. Studies attribute this flattening to the maturation of the initial investment boom in infor - mation technology (and related surge in demand for higher- level skills) and rising competition between education groups for increasingly scarce well- paid jobs (Val - letta 2016, Beaudry and others 2016). 10. The percentage of workers engaged in alternative work arrangements in the United States\u2014 defined as temporary help agency workers, on- call workers, con - tract workers, and in de pen dent contractors or freelancers\u2014 rose from about 10 percent in 2005 to 16 percent in 2015 (Katz and Krueger 2016). In a recent study of the rise of the gig economy, those engaged wholly or partly in in de pen dent work either by choice or necessity are estimated to account for 20 percent to 30 percent of the working- age population in the United States and fifteen advanced Eu ro pean Union countries (McKinsey Global Institute 2016). 11. In the United States, for example, estimates of the unit cost of financial in - termediation do not show a significant decline despite the introduction of new technologies over the past three de cades (Philippon 2016b). 12. Intergenerational earnings elasticity in figure 5-19 mea sures the average proportional increase in a son's adult earnings predicted by this father's adult earn - ings mea sured approximately three de cades earlier. A higher intergenerational elas - ticity implies lower intergenerational mobility. 13. \"Education then, beyond all other devices of human origin, is the great equalizer of the conditions of men, the balance- wheel of the social machinery\" (Horace Mann). 14. Social programs directed at the lower end of income distribution have been strengthened in emerging economies in recent years, notably through the adop - tion of conditional cash transfers (CCT)\u2014 though total social spending remains Rising Inequality 181 much lower than in advanced economies. Pioneered in Latin Amer i ca, the devel - oping region with the highest level of income in equality, CCT programs have been credited as a factor contributing to the region's success over the past de cade in be - ginning to reduce its high in equality (World Bank 2016). 15. Incorporating in- kind benefits of public spending into income distribution accounting, however, pres ents difficult challenges of valuation of these benefits and their fiscal incidence. 16. Grigoli and Robles (2017) estimate that the relationship between in equality and economic growth switches from positive to negative at a net (post- taxes and transfers) Gini of 0.27. In 2015, the net Gini in more than 80 percent of OECD coun - tries was in excess of this threshold. The average net Gini for OECD countries as a whole was 0.32 in that year. 17. For nineteen OECD countries for which long- term data are available, in - equality rose by an average of more than two Gini points between 1985 and 2005, an increase estimated to have reduced cumulative growth between 1990 and 2010 by an average of 4.7 percentage points (OECD 2015a).

Taking on In equality (Washington, D.C.).191SIX Boosting Productivity and Reducing In equality An Interconnected Policy Agenda ZIA QURESHI Slowing productivity growth and rising income in equality pres ent two major challenges of our times. Together, these trends have produced weaker and less inclusive economic growth, caused a slower and unequally shared rise in living standards, and contributed to adverse socio political devel - opments. While growth picked up in most economies in 2017 and near- term economic prospects have improved, deeper, longer- term productivity and in equality challenges remain. The prospects for a sustained strengthening of economic growth and the achievement of a more inclusive pattern of growth will depend on policies to address these challenges. Previous chapters documented and analyzed the trends of slowing pro - ductivity and rising in equality over the past couple of de cades. One key finding is that the slowdown in productivity and the concurrent rise in in - equality are interconnected, with impor tant common drivers and mutu - ally reinforcing mechanisms. Policies to combat and reverse these trends are interconnected as well. Reviving stronger productivity growth and reducing income in equality pres ent enormous policy challenges, and the po liti cal economy of reform is difficult and complex. But there is some good news. To the extent slow - ing productivity and rising in equality are driven by common factors, there 192 productive equity is potential for win- win policies. Productivity and equity are often seen in terms of a trade- off in economic policy debates. However, research on re - cent trends points to impor tant synergies and complementarities between the two, suggesting scope for policies that can help promote both produc - tivity and equity. We refer to this interconnected policy agenda as an agenda for productive equity. Inevitably there will be trade- offs. Forces such as globalization and tech - nology always produce winners and losers, but policies can play an impor - tant role in balancing these and aiming for growth that is more robust as well as more inclusive. The linkages among policies and their impacts call for an integrated approach to formulating the policy agenda that captures reform synergies and addresses potential conflicts through appropriate pri - oritization, sequencing, and packaging of policies. The 2017 OECD report on economic policy reforms makes a strong case for implementing reforms in packages that improve policy coherence and help integrate the agenda for stronger and more inclusive growth (OECD 2017a).1 The agenda ahead will require innovation in policies. Technology is changing the economic landscape in many ways. For example, it is chang - ing how firms compete and grow in markets, and it is changing the nature of work and job dynamics. These changes will call for new, out- of- the- box thinking, experimentation, and learning in competition and technology policies; and in policies affecting skill- rebuilding, worker mobility, and so - cial protection. Policymaking will need to be responsive to a context of significant and continuing change. Drawing on the findings of the previous chapters, this chapter sets out the main ele ments of an integrated policy agenda to address the twin chal - lenges of slowing productivity and rising in equality\u2014 the agenda for pro - ductive equity. The focus here, as in the preceding analy sis, is on advanced economies and major emerging economies, although much of what is pre - sented here would apply also more broadly across economies. Specific pol - icy needs and priorities depend on individual country circumstances. The intent here is to sketch out a broad framing of the main areas requiring the attention of policymakers. The policy agenda spans national and international reforms. Figure 6-1 pres ents a schematic summary. The bulk of the reform agenda concerns pol - icies at the national level. But in a globalized world, policies governing how economies interact\u2014in trade, finance, movement of workers, technology\u2014 Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 193 are increasingly impor tant. With the rising significance of international spillover effects, many policies in the national domain need to be designed with the global context in mind and are more effective if supported by in - ternational coordination. This applies not only to macroeconomic policies but also to structural reforms in areas such as competition and taxation. Ensuring that globalization works for all calls for an integrated approach to national and international reforms. It requires not only rules governing the global system that are fair and provide a level playing field for interna - tional engagement but also national policies that help firms and workers capture opportunities and adjust to change. Within the integrated policy framework summarized in figure 6-1, this chapter focuses on national reforms. International reforms are taken up in the next chapter. Part of the national reform agenda involves addressing some of the legacies of the global financial crisis that slowed recovery from FIGURE 6-1 Promoting Productive Equity: An Integrated Agenda Revive investment - Private investment - Public infrastructure investment Deepen financial sector reform to bolster resilience and promote more productive and inclusive outcomes from growth and innovation in finance Revitalize competition policies for the digital age and spur business dynamism Reform technology policies to boost innovation and its diffusion Improve education and (re)training to broaden and upgrade skill base and adapt skills to shifts in demand Reform labor market policies and revamp social protection to align with changing job dynamics Reform tax systems to boost productivity and equity Pursue open markets for international trade and investment - Supported by domestic policies to facilitate adjustment and promote broad sharing of gains Improve policies on international mobility of skilled labor Promote international cooperation on competition policies, R&D/IPR regimes, taxes, and standards ( labor, environmental) Promote a rules- based international system Bring the institutions of global governance up to speed with globalization, technological change, and related economic transformationsAddress legacies of global financial crisisStep up longer- term, structural reformsMake international system work better and for allImprove global economic governanceNational Reforms International Reforms194 productive equity the crisis and continue to weigh down growth prospects. But many of the causes of the slowdown in productivity growth and the rise in income in - equality run deeper, reflecting longer- term factors predating the crisis. Re - versing these trends will call for a range of structural reforms. Addressing Legacies of the Global Financial Crisis Major financial crises typically cast a long shadow (Reinhart and Rogoff 2014), but one reason economies have taken so long to recover from the last global financial crisis is the inadequacy of policy response. The policy re - sponse was not so much wrong as insufficiently comprehensive. Macroeco - nomic policies responded, especially monetary policies, but not so much structural reforms, except actions in the financial sector where the crisis started. Policymakers initially tended to regard the financial crisis as a cy - clical, albeit a major, shock. It was only later that it became clearer that broader, longer- term structural solutions were needed to restore stronger and more inclusive growth. The pre- crisis growth model was overly reliant on finance and leverage. More needed to be done to strengthen the under - lying foundations of infrastructure and human capital, remove distortions that undermined the functioning of markets, and harness the benefits of new technologies while managing risks.2 So a two- pronged effort is needed on national reforms: more immediate actions to address the remaining legacies of the financial crisis and the ensu - ing deep recession and consolidate the recent acceleration of economic growth; and steady build-up of momentum on longer- term reforms to ad - dress deeper- rooted structural and institutional weaknesses and the secular forces at play. Two areas for attention in the former, shorter- term policy agenda are revival of investment and completion of reforms in the financial sector. Reviving Investment The decline in investment has been an impor tant correlate of the slowdown in productivity growth. Private fixed investment rates fell sharply in ad - vanced economies after the global financial crisis and remain well below Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 195 pre- crisis trend despite some recovery. While private investment in these economies has started to recover, much of their recent growth acceleration has been due to rising private consumption. Investment in emerging mar - kets also declined after the financial crisis, although more gradually. Fall - ing investment rates contributed to slower productivity growth by limiting capital deepening and the adoption of capital- embodied new technologies. Weaker prospects for productivity growth, in turn, depressed investment, producing a negative feedback loop between investment and productivity (Adler and others 2017, Blanchard and others 2017).3 Infrastructure invest - ment declined as well, which hurt the productivity of other investments. Widening infrastructure gaps also hampered inclusive growth, since a strong infrastructure foundation is impor tant for broad- based growth in economic opportunities.4 Private Investment Weak aggregate demand in the aftermath of the global financial crisis was a key factor in the post- crisis decline in investment. In economies where aggre - gate demand remains relatively weak, as is the case in some economies in Eu - rope, policymakers need to continue with policies supportive of a fuller re - covery in demand. Macroeconomic policy space is constrained in many cases, which underscores the importance of policy mixes that exploit the synergies between monetary, fiscal, and structural policies (Gaspar and others 2016). Protracted policy uncertainty in the wake of the financial crisis also dis - couraged investment and shifted its composition away from longer- term and higher- risk/higher- return proj ects that are impor tant for innovation and productivity growth. Indicators of policy- related economic uncertainty have remained elevated in many Eu ro pean economies and have risen more recently in the United States (Bloom and others 2014, Baker and others 2016). Adoption of consistent dynamic macroeconomic policy frameworks to guide policy\u2014 including sound medium- term fiscal policy frameworks to manage public sector balance sheet risks\u2014 and clearer ar - ticulation of structural policies in key areas such as regulation and trade would help reduce policy uncertainty and improve investor confidence. Further pro gress in restoring financial sector health and improving credit flows also would support the revival of investment (more on this 196 productive equity later). Beyond demand- oriented macroeconomic policies and improved access to financing, reform of structural policies would be impor tant to achieving a satisfactory and durable recovery of investment. Barriers to competition and regulatory complexity hurt both the quantity and quality of investment (Alesina and others 2005, OECD 2015a, Guti\u00e9rrez and Philip - pon 2017, \u00c9gert 2017). Structural reforms in these areas are taken up later in this chapter. Infrastructure Investment There is a strong case for a major boost in public infrastructure investment. Driven by fiscal constraints that intensified after the global financial crisis (as well as suboptimal policy choices), public infrastructure investment has been declining, exacerbating infrastructure gaps. While infrastructure backlogs increased, technological change has been transforming infrastruc - ture needs, not just in digital infrastructure but also in sectors such as energy and transport. In the United States, net federal infrastructure invest - ment recently has been close to zero. This trend must be reversed.5 Larry Summers recently called for boosting infrastructure investment in the United States by 1 percent of GDP over ten years, totaling about $2.2 trillion, with half of that increase devoted to addressing backlogs in infrastructure maintenance (Summers 2016a).6 Both in the United States and Eu rope, there are now efforts to boost infrastructure investment that, if designed and implemented well, could yield sizable growth benefits. An IMF study of seventeen advanced economies estimated (in what was termed a conser - vative estimate) that a 1 percent of GDP increase in public infrastructure investment could raise labor productivity by 0.5 percent over the medium term (Adler and others 2017). A recent McKinsey study estimated that re - turns on well- designed infrastructure proj ects could be as high as 20 percent (McKinsey Global Institute 2016). With potentially high returns, and with borrowing costs currently at his - toric lows, well- designed infrastructure proj ects can, in fact, pay for them - selves. User charges can be deployed more effectively to mobilize revenue to support investments\u2014as well as promote efficient use of investments\u2014 while cushioning the impact on the poor. Governments can enhance fiscal space by better using their balance sheets, factoring into the fiscal calculus that borrowing to finance infrastructure creates a liability, but it also creates an Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 197 asset with a stream of future returns (Dervi 2015, Fischer 2015). They should consider adopting capital bud get conventions for infrastructure investments so that costs of proj ects are spread over time rather than all accrued during construction. An OECD study estimated that, on average, there is room to finance a productivity- enhancing multiyear fiscal initiative of at least 0.5 percent of GDP in OECD countries (OECD 2016a). Boosting infrastructure investment at scale will also require an increase in private investment and public- private partnerships in infrastructure. There is substantial potential to increase private participation in infrastruc - ture by improving regulatory and institutional frameworks, including adapting and clarifying frameworks as new technologies disrupt exist - ing paradigms, and by mobilizing long- term private financing through innovations in financial instruments and risk mitigation. Assets under management by institutional investors globally amount to more than $120 trillion, but only about 5 percent of those are invested in infrastructure (Bielenberg and others 2016). With innovations and the right levers to de - velop infrastructure as an asset class, more financing can be mobilized from these sources. Infrastructure investment needs, and potential returns on investment, are especially high in emerging economies. In these economies, infrastruc - ture investment may need to double from current levels over the next fifteen years (from around $2 trillion to $4 trillion annually), owing to their growth needs, rapid urbanization, and already large infrastructure backlogs. Given concerns about \"secular stagnation\" in advanced economies, with an ex - cess of desired savings over desired investment even at low rates of inter - est, channeling more of excess global savings to support infrastructure investment in emerging economies could be a win- win policy for both groups of economies (Bernanke 2015).7 Removing barriers to capital flows and improving investment environments in host countries would spur such real - location of global savings. Multilateral financial institutions can help by playing a stronger intermediation and leveraging role. Besides contributing to stronger and more inclusive growth, sound in - frastructure investments are key to combating climate change and, thus, to the sustainability of economic and social gains. Natu ral capital is a key input into production. Climate change disproportionately hurts the less well- off. Infrastructure currently contributes around 60 percent of global green house gas emissions. It is impor tant, therefore, to ensure that new 198 productive equity infrastructure investments are designed to support environmental sus - tainability. The key action here is to institute carbon pricing, which can shift incentives toward sustainable forms of infrastructure while also gen - erating substantial revenues. Shifting to sustainable infrastructure can open a new world of opportunities for innovation and investment, notably in energy- related sectors, that can boost productivity and growth (Bhattacharya and others 2016, Qureshi 2016). Deepening Financial Sector Reform Much pro gress has been made since the global financial crisis in restoring financial sector stability and normalizing credit conditions, but this re - mains a work in pro gress. Credit disruptions that followed the crisis par - ticularly hurt firm investment in development and adoption of new tech - nologies, exacerbating the slowdown in productivity growth (Anzoategui and others 2016, Adler and others 2017).8 Small and medium- size firms were affected disproportionately. In the short term, completing corporate and bank balance sheet repair to normalize credit flows to support in - vestment remains a priority, especially in euro-area economies. This in - cludes reducing per sis tently large nonperforming loans\u2014by improving insolvency regimes and removing legal impediments to corporate restructuring\u2014 and addressing capital deficiencies at banks that remain weak. Achieving an orderly corporate and financial system deleveraging is also impor tant in several emerging economies, notably China (which also faces the challenge of continuing to move to a more market- based financial system). A key plank of the post- crisis reform agenda has been phased-in imple - mentation of the Basel III capital adequacy framework to bolster bank capital buffers. For systemically impor tant banks, stronger regulatory frameworks are being put in place, including requiring higher capital requirements and credible plans for orderly resolution if needed (\"living wills\"). Addressing the \"too big to fail\" issue is impor tant as explicit or implicit subsidies to large banks have been a factor in encouraging lax lending and also outsize remunerations within financial institutions. Ongoing reforms are also ad - dressing prudential regulation issues in the \"shadow banking\" sector. Inter - national coordination of financial sector regulation has improved under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board. Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 199 Completion and consolidation of these reforms would help strengthen financial system stability and resilience (IMF 2016a). These reforms need to be complemented with deeper structural reforms to improve the function - ing of the financial systems so they better support longer- term productivity growth and more inclusive outcomes. Current reforms have focused mainly on incumbents. Financial sector per for mance would benefit from encour - aging entry and fostering more competition to address prob lems associ - ated with size, interconnectedness, and oligopoly rents, and to better take advantage of new technologies to develop more efficient and inclusive sys - tems. Concentration in the financial sector has increased. In the United States, for example, the top five banks' share of banking assets increased from about 25 percent in 2000 to 45 percent in 2014.9 Removal of tax dis - tortions that favor debt over equity and bias the allocation of finance toward house holds (particularly mortgage debt) and against business investment also would help. Such distortions are common across OECD countries (OECD 2015b). Understandably, post- crisis financial sector reform has focused on the banking system. There is a need, however, to promote other forms of financ - ing to increase the availability of risk capital, including by institutional investors. Seed and early- stage equity capital, such as venture capital, is es - pecially impor tant for innovative and growth- oriented small and medium- size businesses. New technologies in finance so far have not delivered major, broad- based improvements in financial ser vices, as they have been concentrated in ac - tivities such as trading and asset management tailored to the well- off\u2014 and largely by incumbent financial institutions. However, continuing advances in digital technology and technology- enabled business model innovations hold much promise to expand the range of financial ser vices and reduce their cost, open new gateways to entrepreneurship, and de moc ra tize access to finance. Examples of such financial innovations are mobile financial ser - vices, digital platforms, real- time payments, peer- to- peer lending, equity crowdfunding, and blockchains. Young FinTech firms are in the vanguard in the application of these innovations. A challenge for policymakers is to foster the growth of these new entrants into the financial industry while managing associated risks. Some countries\u2014 Australia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, for example\u2014 are using a \"sandbox\" approach that en - courages innovation and generates learning to inform the development of 200 productive equity appropriate regulatory policies to apply to the new entrants (Philippon 2016). The potential for the combination of mobile telephony and digital finan - cial innovations to improve and broaden access to financial services\u2014 for house holds and small and medium- size enterprises\u2014is particularly large in emerging economies (World Bank 2106). Even in a more developed emerging economy, such as Mexico, roughly 60 percent of adults do not have a bank account. By some estimates, FinTech firms could take up to 30 percent of Mexico's banking market in the next de cade and become the linchpin for financial inclusion.10 Stepping Up Longer- Term, Structural Reforms The legacies of the global financial crisis have hurt productivity growth, but this has happened on the back of a secular slowdown in productivity that was already under way before the crisis. Similarly, the rise in income in - equality in major economies started well before the crisis. Impor tant factors under lying these trends have been building over a longer period and are structural in nature. Addressing these factors will require deeper re - forms in product and factor markets and the policies and institutions that underpin them as well as innovative thinking on how forces such as tech - nological change are reshaping the agenda. Structural reforms in advanced and major emerging economies picked up in the aftermath of the financial crisis, spurred by the severe impacts of the crisis. More recently, however, the pace of reform has slackened in both groups of economies, especially in policy areas impor tant for long- term growth in productivity (OECD 2017a). A stronger and more sustained re - form effort is needed\u2014 supported by a change in the policy mind-set to ap - proach growth and inclusion in an integrated manner and address today's economic transformations in a proactive way. Revitalizing Competition Competition is a strong spur to productivity growth; it works to improve the efficiency of resource allocation, and it stimulates new investment and innovation. Competitive markets also promote inclusive growth by pro - Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 201 viding a level playing field to businesses and greater opportunities for workers (Atkinson 2015, Furman and Orszag 2015). As we saw in previous chapters, there are several indicators that suggest that competition has been weakening in many major economies. These include declining busi - ness dynamism (entry and exit of firms); rising concentration of economic power in many industries; sharply higher firm markups; and increasingly skewed distribution of corporate profits, with supernormal profits earned by dominant firms suggesting a rise in economic rents. Weakening com - petition and growing mono poly power are also signaled by high corporate profits at a time of weak investment and productivity growth (Krugman 2016, Summers 2016b). In industries less exposed to competitive pressures, technological dif - fusion is weaker; innovation- embodying new investment is lower; produc - tivity gaps between firms are wider; and aggregate productivity growth is slower (Andrews and others 2016, Cette and others 2016, \u00c9gert 2016). In - creased concentration of market power has reduced the share of corporate revenues going to labor (Autor and others 2017), while increased profitability gaps between dominant firms and most other firms have driven inequali - ties in worker earnings higher (Song and others 2015). Reducing barriers to competition, therefore, could carry the double dividend of boosting pro - ductivity growth and reducing in equality. Regulatory reform needs to aim at both eliminating regulations that im - pede competition and ensuring that adequate rules and regulations are in place to prevent abuse of market power.11 Product market reforms are an impor tant part of this agenda, including actions to remove barriers to firm entry and exit and to check anti- competitive business practices such as anti- competitive mergers, collusive agreements, and exclusionary con - duct. There is considerable scope for simplification and rationalization of domestic product market regulations in a number of advanced economies, especially in network and ser vice industries (OECD 2017a). Preserving and enhancing exposure to international competition by reducing barriers to foreign trade and investment is impor tant as well, especially in emerging economies. Strengthening of institutional frameworks for formulation and enforcement of competition policies would help combat rent-seeking by dominant firms. Also, when regulations are aimed at addressing genuine market failure, care should be taken to avoid unintended negative effects on small firms.12202 productive equity The trend toward increased industry concentration has been boosted by a spike in mergers and acquisitions (Grullon and others 2017). The annual number of M&As recently has been more than twice what is was in the 1990s. Global activity in M&As exceeded $5 trillion in 2015, about half of which was in the United States, with the average size of the deal almost double the average for the previous five years (CEA 2016a). Antitrust enforcement has weakened (Kwoka 2017). In view of the rise in market concentration, the robustness and enforcement of antitrust regimes merit special atten - tion. Guidelines for M&As\u2014 not only horizontal M&As but non- horizontal ones as well\u2014 need to be reviewed and updated in light of the new market realities (Galston and Hendrickson 2018). In addition to competition policy failures, new technologies are con - tributing to increased market concentration by altering the structure of competition in ways that produce \"winner- takes- most\" outcomes. Digital technologies, in par tic u lar, offer scale economies and network effects that encourage the rise of dominant firms\u2014 and globalization reinforces the scale economies by facilitating access to markets worldwide.13 The \"winner- takes- most\" dynamics are most marked in the high- tech sectors, as, for ex - ample, reflected in firms such as Facebook and Google, but could affect broader segments of the economy as digital technology applications penetrate business pro cesses more widely, notably in sectors such as transportation, communications, finance, and parts of retail trade (Amazon, for example, has emerged as a giant in retail trade). Market concentration driven by tech - nological change poses new challenges for competition policies. Even when firms reach dominant positions on the merits of their inno - vations and superior efficiency, monopolies or quasi- monopolies can lead to abuse of market power\u2014 price manipulation, collusion, rent- seeking, and self- entrenchment by erecting barriers to entry\u2014 and discourage business dynamism and further innovation (Rajan and Zingales 2003, Autor and others 2017). The beneficiaries of an open, competitive system often work to close the system and stifle competition\u2014 hence the theme of saving capi - talism from the cap i tal ists that features in much recent research on rising market concentration (Krugman 2015, Reich 2015, Stiglitz 2016). Digital technologies are a major driver of today's economic advances, and a key question is how to ensure that markets continue to provide the competi - tive spark and a setting for fair play. Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 203 Scale economies and network effects give today's high- tech giants char - acteristics of natu ral monopolies. Should they be regulated like public utilities? How do today's digital platforms and networks differ from the net - work industries of the past? How should antitrust laws be adapted to the market power dynamics of the digital age? Some steps have been taken in the United States and Eu rope to address competition issues in the technol - ogy sectors, such as ensuring net neutrality, promoting competitive access to the wireless spectrum, and allowing unlocking of cell phones if consum - ers want to change providers.14 Other areas under consideration by regula - tors include firms' use of big data, wider access to these data, protections for data privacy, ways of making digital data more portable by consumers, and improvement of price transparency amid opaque and changing pric - ing models, including algorithmic pricing (Furman 2016, Marcus 2016). In Eu rope, new rules on data access and protections drawn up by the Eu ro- pean Union (known as the General Data Protection Regulation) came into force in May 2018. Revamping competition policies for the digital economy will require much learning by doing. The combination of technology and globalization also means that com - petition policy needs to become more global. Today's superstar firms typi - cally are multinationals operating and affecting concentration in markets in many countries. The OECD countries have already made pro gress in drawing up common rules to prevent companies from avoiding taxes through profit shifting and parking money in tax havens.15 Similar coop - eration is needed to develop a competition policy framework for the digital economy and address cross- border business practices that restrict compe - tition.16 One recent proposal is for the G20 to take the lead and set up a World Competition Network, building on the model of the Eu ro pean Union's Eu ro pean Competition Network (Marin 2017). Reforming Technology Policies Technology policies are an impor tant complement to competition policies in spurring innovation and productivity growth. Productivity- enhancing innovation has weakened in major economies. It has slowed but remained relatively robust in firms at the technological frontier, but its diffusion across firms within economies has weakened greatly, which is reflected in widening 204 productive equity gaps in productivity per for mance between small groups of industry leaders and the vast majority of other firms. There is a need both to spur innovation at the technological frontier and to facilitate its diffusion more broadly across economies. One area for attention is policies regarding patents. Designed to provide incentives for investment in research, patents have come under increasing scrutiny amid concerns that overly broad and stringent intellectual prop - erty protection may, in fact, be hurting innovation and stifling competi - tion. Recent empirical research on patents has been largely unsupportive of their role in promoting innovation (Moser 2013, Williams 2017). Patent use is greater among big, established firms, which may use patent protections strategically to keep potential competitors at bay (and extract high prices for their products). There is sizable lobbying and rent- seeking activity around patents, in which the established players have a clear advantage. The result is discouragement of new entrants and new or follow-on innovations as well as prevention of a broader diffusion and adop - tion of innovations across firms. Industries that have seen larger increases in market concentration have also seen larger increases in patent- intensity and greater slowing of technological diffusion (Autor and others 2017).17 Stronger patent protection may be associated with wider productivity gaps within industries (Andrews and others 2016). Patent trolls and patent liti - gation, booming by- products of the patent system as it has expanded, add to frictions that hold up innovation and its diffusion.18 A majority of pat - ents issued are not actually used in production but create legal thickets for potential competitors. Prob lems with patents have led some to call for a complete abolition of the patent system (for example, Boldrin and Levine 2013).19 This may be too radical an approach. However, a significant reform does seem to be in order to improve the patent system and give freer rein to competition that is the prime driver of innovation. Ele ments of patent system reform could include instituting stricter criteria and tighter approval pro cesses for the award of patents (so as to reward only meaningful\u2014 \"new, useful, and non- obvious\"\u2014 inventions), shortening patent lives, streamlining pro cesses around standard- essential patents, and ensuring that the litigation system is not un - balanced in favor of patent holders (Baily and Montalbano 2016, Furman 2016). One reform area to explore is to move away from a \"one size fits all\" patent regime and adopt a differentiated approach: across industries, such Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 205 as phar ma ceu ti cals where the gestation period and life of inventions tend to be longer than in other industries, notably digital technology and soft - ware (Roin 2014); and by firm size, as research suggests that patent protec - tion supports innovation more in smaller firms (Galasso and Schankerman 2015).20 Besides patent reform, governments can make better use of fiscal incen - tives to promote innovation. The private sector is prone to underinvest in research and development because R&D investments have knowledge spill - overs for the economy at large that firms do not take into account in their decisions.21 Fiscal incentives such as R&D subsidies and tax benefits help correct this shortfall. Improvements in the design of these incentives can enhance their impact and cost- effectiveness. This includes targeting incen - tives to investments with potential for large economy- wide benefits and ensuring that young and small firms are not at a disadvantage in accessing the tax incentives. Best practices include payroll tax relief for researchers and refundable R&D tax credits (IMF 2016b). There is evidence that such well- designed incentives can raise R&D investment and boost productiv - ity (Westmore 2014, \u00c9gert 2016). There is also a need to bolster public investment in R&D, which weak - ened in many major economies as fiscal conditions tightened. In the United States, for example, government R&D spending fell from 1.2 percent of GDP in the early 1980s to 0.6 percent in 2015, and its share in total R&D spending fell from 45 percent to 22 percent (Shambaugh and others 2017). With its public good characteristics and focus on basic research that private firms are unlikely to undertake, public R&D investment complements applied private research.22 Many breakthrough innovations that the private sector has developed commercially had their origins in public research at govern - ment research institutes, defense- related research programs, and publicly supported research programs at universities\u2014 including in medicine and bio technology, information technology, nanotechnology, and aerospace (Moyer 2012, Mazzucato 2015).23 Looking ahead, public research can play a similar seminal role in clean energy and other technologies to combat cli - mate change. Public research programs should pay par tic u lar attention to fostering broad access to the fruits of public R&D, reflecting this objective in the design and focus of these programs as well as how the resulting innova - tions are deployed (Cozzens and Thakur 2014, Chataway and others 2014, 206 productive equity Breznitz and Zehavi 2017). Patent reform could reinforce this emphasis by requiring that government- supported research may not lead to patents but should be available to all market participants (Boldrin and Levine 2013). Support encouraging R&D collaboration between universities and firms can facilitate technological diffusion by providing smaller firms with ac - cess to sources of knowledge (OECD 2015c). A recent study of the United States finds that innovations are highly concentrated in high- income groups and that education and internship programs to increase exposure to inno - vation among disadvantaged groups ( those disadvantaged by income class, gender, and race) can significantly boost overall innovation by helping the many \"lost Einsteins\" in these groups; indeed, such programs can have larger impacts on innovation than increasing the financial incentives to innovate by, for example, reducing tax rates (Bell and others 2017). Complementary reforms can help raise resources for boosting public investment in R&D and related educational programs. For example, car - bon pricing reform can help in scaling up support for research on clean technologies. Currently governments spend orders of magnitude more on harmful fossil- fuel subsidies than on clean energy research. Governments could also explore ways of better recouping some of their investment in research to help replenish their research bud gets and sustain R&D programs\u2014 producing a better balance in sharing risks and rewards of pub - lic research investment compared to the current paradigm where risks are socialized but rewards are privatized. Ensuring that companies do not take advantage of loopholes in the tax system and pay adequate taxes on their profits is the obvious way. Other possibilities include requiring companies to repay research grants if their products succeed financially or acquiring equity stakes in the commercialization of successful technologies directly supported by public research funds (Lazonick and Mazzucato 2013, Ro - drik 2015).24 While major emerging economies have boosted their R&D programs, most technology creation occurs in a small number of advanced economies: close to two- thirds of global R&D is undertaken in the G7 countries. Inter - national policies that promote technology transfers are, therefore, crucial to producing stronger and more inclusive impacts of technological pro gress on global productivity (Baker and others 2017). Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 207 Investing in Skills The new technologies demand di ff er ent, higher- level managerial and worker skills, and their success depends greatly on the availability of these com - plementary skills. In advanced economies, globalization also has shifted demand toward higher- level skills. An impor tant part of the explanation of the paradox of slowing productivity in the midst of technological advances is skill shortages and mismatches that prevent broader diffusion of these advances throughout economies by limiting firm capacities to adopt and adapt.25 These factors also contribute to increased income in equality as gaps in firm profitability widen and as wage differentials increase with higher premia on scarce skills. Investing in skills, thus, is a key part of the policy agenda, cutting across the productivity and equity domains. There is active current debate on the implications of the new technologies\u2014 digitization, robotics, artificial intelligence\u2014 for the future of work and jobs. As described in the previous chapter, these technologies are having major impacts on labor markets, notably reducing the demand for labor for tasks involving routine and lower- to middle- level skills. This has led some commentators to draw up dire scenarios of massive job losses from automation\u2014 what Autor and Salomons (2017) call \"robocalypse\" sce - narios. Some illustrative headline estimates of jobs at risk of automation are: 47 percent in the United States (Frey and Osborne 2013); 57 percent in the OECD countries (World Bank 2016); two- thirds in developing econo - mies (Kim 2017); and half of the jobs globally\u2014 around 2 billion (Educa - tion Commission 2016). Such predictions have prompted calls for mea sures to slow the pace of automation, such as a robot tax (Gates 2017, Shiller 2017). Technological innovation is a primary driver of long- term productivity growth and rise in living standards, and policies that undermine it would be counterproductive. Similarly, how many jobs will be killed by automa - tion seems like the wrong question to focus on; it looks only at the destruc - tion of existing jobs and ignores the creation of new jobs by the new technologies\u2014as they generate new and di ff er ent tasks and propel economic growth.26 Similar predictions of large- scale job destruction and high technological unemployment were made in previous major episodes of automation, but they all failed to materialize.27 As technological change made some old jobs redundant, it created new ones that were comple- mentary with the new technologies.208 productive equity The employment implications of technological change should be seen in terms of a pro cess of dynamic adjustment of old jobs and tasks giving way to new ones (Autor 2015, Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018a, Autor and Sa - lomons 2018).28 Digital technologies will change the skill content of jobs. The composition of employment also will change, with more people working in de pen dently as digital platforms and the \"sharing economy\" expand opportunities microentrepreneurs (Sundarajan 2016, Bryn - jolfsson and McAfee 2017). The main issue is that the nature of work is changing, and the main policy challenge is to equip workers with the skills demanded by the new technologies and support workers during the ad - justment pro cess. The supply of skills has been slow to respond to the changing demand; education and training have been falling behind in the race with technol - ogy (Goldin and Katz 2008, Autor 2014). Policy reforms need to pick up pace to adapt education and training systems to the changing workplace. Up - skilling and reskilling workers will require changes and innovations both in the content of education and training programs and how they are de - signed and delivered. The new technologies reinforce the need to build science, technology, engineering, and mathe matics (STEM) skills, but they also demand a foun - dation of broader skills, such as critical thinking, prob lem solving, adapt - ability, information literacy, and social/communications skills (Winthrop and McGivney 2016, World Economic Forum 2016, Gormley 2017). These skills complement digital technologies, are hard to codify and automate, and make workers more retrainable for midcareer transitions to other jobs or in de pen dent work as entrepreneurs. Training in specific occupational skills should be buttressed by these broader, portable skills. Relatedly, stron - ger models and a broader range of options need to be developed for lifelong learning, given the fast- changing skill needs but also the aging of workforces in many economies. The old cycle of \"learn- work- retire\" is changing toward one of continuous learning. Across education systems, stronger commitment to investment needs to be underpinned by greater attention to quality and relevance. Bud get constraints heighten the need for efficiency improvements to free up more resources for new investments in building skills. There is substantial scope for doing better on these dimensions in all countries, emerging and ad - vanced (OECD 2016b, World Bank 2017). Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 209 Creative ways of co- opting nontraditional providers of education and training, such as employer training programs and apprenticeships, would not only augment skill- building efforts but also help better match those ef - forts with the actual skill needs of businesses. Skill mismatches will be an increasingly serious issue as automation and artificial intelligence continue to shift the demand for skills (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018b). Across OECD countries, on average already around one- quarter of workers report a mis - match between their skills and those required by the job (Adalet McGowan and Andrews 2015); and, globally, some 40 percent of employers report that they are finding it difficult to recruit people with skills they need (Manpow - erGroup 2015). Good models of apprenticeship, such as those in Germany, could be studied for wider adoption. Well- designed tax incentives could encourage companies to invest more in human capital. Innovative financing mechanisms, such as \"lifelong learn - ing accounts,\"29 could help workers adapt to new technologies and learn new skills. Innovations in government aid (grants, tax incentives) and stu - dent loan programs could improve their effectiveness and flexibility in cov - ering not just first- time college entrants but also older adults returning to school. Access to lifelong learning is typically more difficult for lower- skilled workers. Competency- based qualifications that recognize alternative cre - dentials based on actual skill acquisition rather than only formal academic degrees could broaden opportunities for learning and skill certification and improve talent matching (OECD 2016c). Investment in education R&D should be increased to find innovations for skill development in the twenty- first century that work and can be scaled up (Turner 2017). Technology is not only shaping which skills are in demand but also how skills may be acquired. Online courses and other technology- enabled so - lutions offer new opportunities for broadening access, tailoring content to needs, and improving delivery that education and training systems should exploit. Digital platforms can help improve matching between workers and jobs and enhance job and learning opportunities in the expanding gig econ - omy. Investing in digital infrastructure and improving the digital ecosystem to promote digital access and literacy would help harness the potential of these opportunities. Despite pro gress, the digital divide remains wide: about half of the world's population is still offline, including 20 percent of the population in advanced economies and 60 percent in developing economies (ITU 2016).210 productive equity Education is a power ful equalizer of economic opportunity. Improv - ing access to quality education for all is key to addressing the inequalities of opportunity that have caused intergenerational income mobility to decline, as observed in the previous chapter. Reducing inequalities in ed - ucational attainment takes on added significance in a skills- based econ - omy where their consequences are still greater, for both the individual worker and the economy at large. Lower- skill and lower- wage workers are disproportionately vulnerable to the disruptions of technology. Inequali - ties in educational attainment start at young ages and are magnified at higher levels of education. Large proportions of children do not receive pre- primary education, despite evidence that investment at this level of - fers high returns in terms of educational success and adult productivity.30 Gaps in higher education attainment by family income level have wid - ened rather than narrowed in many economies.31 As policymakers seek to strengthen and adapt education and training systems, improving af - fordability and access to promote the inclusion of the eco nom ically dis - advantaged should be an integral part of the agenda (Holzer and Baum 2017, Turner 2017, OECD 2017c). A strategy of \"progressive universalism\" would aim to improve education and training for all, while prioritizing the needs of the disadvantaged and areas of highest return (Education Commission 2016). Revamping Labor Market Policies and Social Protection Building the skills of workers and their adaptability to changing demand for skills needs to be complemented with improvements in labor markets and social protection arrangements that facilitate worker mobility between jobs. As discussed in the previous chapter, labor market dynamism has declined in many major economies. Barriers to worker mobility and inad - equacies of social protection are contributing to outcomes that are both inefficient and unequal. Shifts in the nature of work and jobs caused by technological change reinforce the need for greater labor market flexibility and stronger supportive institutions. The implied policy agenda has three interacting ele ments: employment protection laws that factor in the need for flexibility; social security arrange - ments that support workers in the transition between jobs; and active labor market policies that help retrain workers and match them with new Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 211 jobs. These ele ments, which combine labor market flexibility and security for workers, are often referred to by the portmanteau term \"flexicurity.\" The overarching princi ple of flexicurity\u2014 approaching these ele ments in an in - tegrated manner and putting the focus on protecting workers rather than specific jobs\u2014is increasingly being reflected in policy in a number of coun - tries and has been adopted by the Eu ro pean Council for guidance to mem - bers (Eu ro pean Commission 2007). Perhaps the best- known, and widely admired, model of this approach is the Danish flexicurity system.32 But no one size fits all, and countries can tailor reforms to their circumstances. A priority for policy should be to offer a better \"springboard\" to new jobs (Tre - bilcock 2014). Labor market reforms should have a forward- looking orientation. Forward- looking policies, including supporting and reskilling workers, aim to help workers adjust to change and take advantage of new opportunities. In contrast, backward- looking policies, such as highly restrictive job protection laws, aim to preserve the status quo and, in par tic u lar, keep incumbent workers in existing jobs. Among advanced economies, doing more and better on forward- looking policies applies to all of them, includ - ing the United States; reforming backward- looking policies, such as the reform of stringent job protection laws currently under way in France, has par tic u lar relevance for the Eu ro pean economies (Bernanke 2017). Approach - ing these reforms as a package has the advantage that a reduction in rules on worker dismissals may need to be balanced with stronger social security and active labor market policies. Social security systems will need a revamp as digital technologies con - tinue to reshape work and the workforce, with higher rates of change be - tween jobs, the need for continuous reskilling, and more people working on short- term contracts or in de pen dently in the gig economy. These new labor market dynamics driven by technological change add to the reform challenge social security systems already face in many economies to ensure their longer- term fiscal sustainability. The social contract, hitherto based largely on long- term formal employer- employee relationships, will need to be refashioned, with benefits such as health and retirement made more por - table and adapted to accommodate di ff er ent kinds of work arrangements (Sundarajan 2016). Similarly, unemployment insurance will need to be re - thought to cover di ff er ent types of jobs and incent workers to move to new jobs.212 productive equity Several proposals have been put forward to revamp social security sys - tems that are currently the subject of debate and experimentation. One such proposal is to provide a universal basic income (UBI) regardless of employ - ment status. Economists' views differ on this, based on how it is struc - tured, the extent to which it is an add-on to or a substitute for a variety of existing social programs, and the level of the benefit and its fiscal afford - ability.33 Pi lots of UBI are currently under way or planned in Finland and some subnational jurisdictions such as Ontario, Canada, and Oakland and Stockton, California.34 A variant of UBI preferred by some is a negative in - come tax up to a certain income threshold.35 Another proposal is to set up individual \"shared security accounts\" that would pool all of workers' social benefits and would be fully portable across all jobs, supported by \"shared security standards\" (Hanauer and Rolf 2015). An innovation launched in France in January 2017 focused on support for training consists of a portable \"personal activity account,\" where each worker accumulates training rights based on di ff er ent kinds of work that can be drawn upon when needed.36 Automatic enrollment in tax- preferred retirement accounts or other sensible default options are being considered for workers who do not have an employer- sponsored plan (Furman 2014a). Adaptations in unemployment benefits also are being explored, includ - ing, for example, making wage insurance more widely available (Litan 2016, Holzer 2017). Learning from this debate and experimentation should help inform and guide policy. Proposals for a UBI are also being debated in emerging economies, such as India, where it could provide a more efficient alternative to an assortment of targeted social programs that are often in effec tively implemented (Brad - han 2016, Ministry of Finance, Government of India 2017). One major concern with UBI is that it may weaken incentives to work. However, evi - dence from well- designed cash transfer programs in emerging economies does not find any significant reduction in work by the recipients (Banerjee and others 2017). Reform of social protection is impor tant in emerging economies also for reducing labor market segmentation; even in a more advanced emerging economy such as Mexico, nearly 60 percent of workers have informal jobs (Levy and Rodrik 2017). Another major reform objec - tive is increasing the participation of women in the labor force, for which improved access to quality early childhood education and care programs and flexible work arrangements can be particularly effective. This is not Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 213 exclusively an emerging economy issue, of course. In the United States, for example, despite pro gress, 26 percent of women age fifteen to fifty- four were out of the labor force in 2014 (Furman 2014b). In many major economies, rising concentration of market power in industries coupled with declining unionization and a weakening role of minimum wages tilted the bargaining pro cess in labor markets in favor of employers. Pro- competition reforms in product markets, as discussed ear - lier in this chapter, would, therefore, have the additional benefit of restoring a more competitive setting in labor markets for employer- employee nego - tiations.37 Well- functioning labor market institutions, such as collective bargaining through unions and minimum wages, also help ensure that workers get a fair share in economic returns. Another reform that would add to competition in labor markets is to roll back the ever- increasing pro - fessional licensing requirements and non- compete restrictions; in the United States, almost one- third of workers require a government occu - pational license (CEA 2016b), and between one- fifth to one- quarter of workers are bound by non- compete restrictions (Shambaugh and Nunn 2018). With the rise in nonstandard types of work, the role and practices of collective bargaining will need to evolve as well. Some innovations are emerging already, such as nonstandard workers setting up new unions or associations,38 traditional unions working to improve coverage of nonstan - dard forms of work,39 and the use of social media for collective action (OECD 2017d). The changing workplace and distributional dynamics have also caused renewed interest in proposals for worker stock owner ship, where workers have a chance to share profits and participate in corporate gover - nance (Basu 2016, Summers 2017). Reforming Tax Systems Tax policy is often seen as presenting trade- offs between productivity and economic growth on the one hand and distributional equity on the other. Such trade- offs do exist, and a challenge for tax reforms is to design mea - sures to mitigate them. However, there is substantial scope for reforms that offer win- win possibilities; these are reforms that improve the tax structure and, depending on the country's fiscal needs, enable the desired level of reve - nues to be raised efficiently and equitably. In relation to equity, taxes are 214 productive equity often seen as a tool of re distribution. But they can also be a tool of predis - tribution; tax design can promote equity by creating incentives and influ - encing be hav iors that improve the distribution of market incomes before taxes.40 Policymakers should aim to take maximum advantage of reform opportunities to promote inclusive growth\u2014 reforms that boost growth but also improve equity. In the area of labor income taxation, reducing the tax wedge for low- wage workers can help boost labor force participation\u2014an increasingly impor tant policy concern in aging economies\u2014as well as improve distri - butional outcomes. Greater use could be made of options such as earned- income tax credits (EITC) at low- income levels, which have been found to be effective in bolstering incentives to work. In the United States, for ex - ample, which has seen the labor force participation rate for prime- age men (age twenty- five to fifty- four) decline by 9 percentage points over the past few de cades, there have been proposals to expand the EITC that merit po - liti cal support (Furman 2014b, Krueger 2017). Reducing the higher effec - tive marginal tax rates that second earners in families often face could strengthen incentives to work for second earners, typically women. Coun - tries could also consider lowering payroll taxes and social security contri - butions where they are excessively high, which could spur firms' demand for labor and (especially relevant for emerging economies) curb incentives for businesses to remain in the informal economy. Countries may consider shifting part of the financing of social benefits to general tax revenue to avoid overburdening social security contributions and labor income taxation (and attendant labor market distortions) in fund - ing the social security systems\u2014 particularly for benefits that are weakly linked to the contributions made, such as unemployment benefits (OECD 2017e).41 Such a shift in financing may also be needed to extend social security coverage to an expanding part of the labor force that is working in de pen- dently or in short- term or other aty pi cal contracts. The changing nature of work driven by digital technologies will require more attention to horizontal equity in the tax treatment of workers in di ff er ent work arrangements. To - gether with options such as raising the statutory retirement age, countries with aging workforces should correct provisions in the tax and benefit sys - tems that generate incentives for early retirement. Labor income is often taxed at much higher rates than capital income, which can distort investment and employment decisions and entail both Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 215 efficiency and equity costs. For example, biases in tax systems that favor capital relative to labor may be creating incentives toward \"excessive auto - mation\" (Acemoglu and Restrepo 2018b). Policy should seek to broadly har - monize personal income tax rates and the combined burden of corporate income tax and dividend/capital gains taxation. Taxation of capital can be administratively difficult because of its mobility, which can spark a race to the bottom across tax jurisdictions. Indeed, the corporate income tax rate has fallen sharply in many countries. Most recently, the corporate tax rate was substantially lowered in the United States as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In a period when corporate profitability rates have been high, boosted by sizable rents associated with increased mono poly power in markets, the optimal policy may be to tax corporate profits at relatively high rather than low rates. There is some encouraging recent pro gress under OECD/G20 pro cesses on international cooperation to curb tax base erosion and profit shifting and improve information sharing between tax jurisdictions. This should strengthen the ability of national tax authorities to tax capital more effec - tively. In an increasingly networked global economy and fast- expanding digital commerce, international cooperation on tax matters will be even more impor tant. Policy should also seek to tax di ff er ent types of capital income in a neutral way (Gordon 2016, IMF 2017b). Tax systems in many OECD econ - omies are characterized by differential taxation of types of capital income, asset types, and sources of financing, which distort investment decisions and misallocate resources. Tax provisions that favor debt over equity par - ticularly disadvantage small firms, start- ups, and R&D investment that tend to rely more on equity financing. Complexity of tax systems and associated compliance costs, and uneven enforcement (especially in emerging econo - mies), can also put smaller firms and new entrants at a disadvantage.42 Sim - plifying taxes and improving administration (where digitization can help) can, thus, improve both the efficiency and equity of the tax system. Taxes on property, wealth, and inheritance are equitable and also less distortionary than taxes on income but are underutilized in most econo - mies. Wealth in equality is typically much higher than income in equality and has risen more sharply in many countries. High wealth in equality is a significant factor contributing to the increase in intergenerational per sis- tence of income in equality. Taxation of wealth has not kept pace with the 216 productive equity surge in wealth; the effective tax rate on di ff er ent types of wealth collec - tively fell from an average of around 0.9 percent in 1970 to 0.5 percent in the early 2010s (Clements and others 2015).43 Making better use of prop - erty and wealth taxation can improve the tax structure from the stand - point of both economic efficiency and equality (of outcomes as well as opportunity).44 While the primary contribution of taxation to the pursuit of equity ob - jectives is through financing spending (such as on education and social pro - grams discussed in the previous sections), taxes themselves can contribute to those objectives through their progressivity. The progressivity of taxes in major economies has declined sharply, which, together with cuts in trans - fers, has contributed to a reduced redistributive role of the state, as dis - cussed in the previous chapter. Well- designed re distribution through taxes and transfers may not be inimical to growth and can even be pro- growth (Ostry and others 2014). There is scope for recovering some of the lost tax progressivity without hurting economic growth (IMF 2017a). A mix of tax mea sures could be con - sidered, including rewinding some of the large reductions in the top in - come tax rates\u2014 which could be particularly challenging po liti cally. The most efficient way to improve the progressivity of the tax system is to re - form the assortment of tax expenditures that characterize most tax systems, such as favorable treatment of mortgages, capital gains, dividends, pension contributions, carried interest and stock options, and di ff er ent types of ex - penses. These tax expenditures typically are regressive, cause economic distortions, and entail sizable revenue losses. Removing or limiting these tax breaks can broaden the tax base and raise average tax rates without hav - ing to raise marginal rates. Similarly, greater horizontal equity in the tax treatment of di ff er ent tax bases\u2014 labor income, capital income, wealth\u2014 can enhance vertical equity. Even proportional taxation of capital income and wealth can increase the overall progressivity of the tax system. Depend - ing on their circumstances, countries may also consider progressivity in taxing capital income and wealth, which could relieve the burden of pro - gressivity carried by the personal income tax (Brys and others 2016). Curb - ing tax avoidance and evasion also helps raise effective progressivity of tax systems. Reforms should be guided by overall progressivity of the tax and trans - fer system. For example, a shift in the balance of taxation from income to Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 217 consumption that improves the efficiency of the tax system from a growth perspective may be accompanied by adjustments in taxes and transfers to compensate lower- income house holds who may be hit harder by the shift. Not all tax expenditures cause distortions and waste. They can be used to produce better economic and social outcomes by aligning private and social costs and returns. Tax incentives can correct disincentives from knowledge spillovers and worker mobility that lead private firms to under - invest in R&D and underprovide skills training. Such tax incentives for investment in R&D and human capital need to be designed well to be cost- effective and accessible to potential users on a level footing.45,46 Carbon taxes can raise revenue efficiently by helping to overcome a major market failure\u2014 the climate externality. The revenue can be used to support investment and innovation to foster stronger and inclusive growth in a sustainable way. Depending on country circumstances, it can also be used as part of a plan to pay down national debt and improve longer- term fiscal sustainability. Carbon taxes can be implemented in a revenue- neutral way as well. One way is to reduce other, less efficient taxes. Another is to distribute the revenue to house holds equitably via transfers\u2014 carbon divi - dends (Commission on Carbon Prices 2017, Shultz and Summers 2017). A carbon tax will reduce the need for an extensive apparatus of environmen - tal regulations and subsidies. Conclusion Much of the attention of policymakers in major economies in recent years has been focused on the more immediate agenda of responding to the global financial crisis and the ensuing recession. Impor tant legacies of the crisis remain, but as economies recover, attention must shift to addressing deeper structural reforms that will drive longer- term economic prospects. Slowing productivity growth and rising in equality are the two defining challenges that policymakers need to confront through deeper reforms of markets, poli - cies, and institutions as they steer economies toward stronger, sustained, and more inclusive growth. The drivers of slowing productivity and rising in equality are closely in - terconnected, creating scope for win- win policies. The agenda is not one of productivity versus equity, but rather one of productive equity. It is best 218 productive equity approached through integrated policy packages that exploit the synergies between productivity and inclusiveness\u2014 and allow potential trade- offs to be mitigated. The policy agenda is broad, cutting across policy domains. Countries will need to define and sequence policy actions depending on their specific circumstances. Given the agenda's scope and interconnectedness, it would pay to underpin policy formulation with a strategic overview of the objec - tives, policy priorities, and linkages and a whole- of- government approach. Technology is changing competition in markets, the nature of work, and demand for skills in major ways. These changes have profound implications for policy. They call for new thinking and innovations to revitalize compe - tition for the digital age and promote broad diffusion of the benefits of new technologies across firms. Training and social protection need to be rethought to upskill and reskill workers and support their transition between jobs in a dynamic job market and to adapt systems to new work arrangements. Tax and transfer policies need to adjust as well. The agenda ahead will demand greater policy responsiveness to change and more ex - perimentation and learning. The effectiveness of policies at the national level is increasingly inter - twined with cooperation at the international level, given global interde - pendence and spillover effects. How international trade and investment and flows of skills and technology are managed and complemented with na - tional policies have impor tant effects on productivity and income distri - bution. Globalization has been a positive force for productivity and growth but some of its distributional consequences have recently triggered a pop - ulist backlash. How can globalization work better and in more inclusive ways? What improvements in international cooperation and global gover - nance can support national efforts to achieve stronger and more inclusive growth? We turn to these questions in the next chapter. Notes 1. The 2017 Going for Growth report finds that around one- half of the policy reforms proposed in the report for individual member countries to boost growth would also reduce income in equality, close to one- tenth could increase income in equality, and the remainder would have neutral or uncertain effects on in equality. It argues that, compared to piecemeal reforms, implementing reforms in packages helps maximize reform synergies through complementary policies and allows re - form conflicts to be addressed through offsetting actions. Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 219 2. See, for example, El- Erian (2017), who argues that policymakers missed the central lessons of the global financial crisis and notes that the crisis called for sig - nificant reforms to the under lying growth model. 3. Falling investment may have lowered TFP growth in advanced economies by around 0.2 percent per year over the post- crisis period (Adler and others 2017). 4. There is much recent evidence that efficient infrastructure spending not only boosts productivity and economic growth but can also help reduce in equality. On the productivity/growth and distributional effects of infrastructure investment, see, for example, IMF 2014, Calder\u00f3n and S\u00e9rven 2014, Gibson and Rioja 2015, and Hooper and others 2017. 5. In advanced economies as a group, real public capital stock declined from around 70 percent of GDP in the early 1980s to around 60 percent in 2013 (Adler and others 2017). 6. Poor maintenance hurts productivity in two ways: by reducing the produc - tivity of the infrastructure asset itself and by reducing the productivity of activi - ties dependent on it. 7. A simulation of such redirection of savings from advanced economies to in - frastructure investment in emerging economies (excluding China) shows that global growth could rise by 7 percent over a ten- year period (McKibbin and others 2014). 8. A recent IMF study estimates that in those advanced economies where credit conditions tightened more severely, the post- crisis productivity decline in annual TFP growth was 1.31 percentage points greater on average in the more credit- constrained firms compared to less credit- constrained firms. The former group of firms reduced their investment rate in R&D and other intangible capital by 0.81 per - centage point more than the latter group of firms (Adler and others 2017). 9. \"A Giant Prob lem,\" The Economist, September 17, 2016. 10.

A recent study of U.S. firms finds regulatory policies a significant factor in driving the rise in industrial concentration (Guti\u00e9rrez and Philippon 2017). 12. Regulatory compliance typically entails fixed costs that do not vary with firm size. So regulatory economies of scale can give a competitive advantage to big - ger, older firms. In the United States, for example, small firms may be penalized more by laws such as Sarbanes- Oxley and Dodd- Frank\u2014 and by the tax code. 13. \"In normal markets you can have Pepsi and Coke and a bunch of others.

About 30 percent of global foreign direct investment flows through tax havens, and big companies routinely use transfer pricing to shift profits to no- or low- tax locations ( The Economist, September 17, 2016). 16. The EU recently took antitrust action against Google for abusing its domi - nance in search and unfairly privileging its own ser vices on the platform it controls. 17. Similar concerns are expressed about copyrights, whose long terms (life plus seventy years in the United States) are considered to have contributed to high concentration in the entertainment industry. Four rec ord labels account for roughly 85 percent of U.S. recorded music sales and 70 percent of the global mar - ket, while five movie studios have captured around 80 percent of the U.S. market and 75 percent globally (Lindsey and Teles 2017). In publishing, a field once popu - lated with in de pen dent publishers, just five conglomerates now account for two- thirds of all books published in the United States (Galston and Hendrickson 2018). 18. Patent trolling cost the U.S. economy an estimated $500 billion between 1990 and 2010 (Bessen and others 2011). 19. \"Both theory and evidence suggest that while patents can have a partial equilibrium effect of improving incentives to invent, the general equilibrium ef - fect on innovation can be negative. . . . Our preferred policy solution is to abolish patents entirely\" (Boldrin and Levine 2013). 20. Care needs to be exercised to avoid creating undue complexity in the pat - ent regimes. Development of an administrable system of tailoring patent rights is an impor tant direction for future research. 21. An IMF study estimates that private R&D investment would be higher by 40 percent if private investment decisions took into account the broad knowledge spillovers. It estimates that such an increase in R&D investment could lift GDP in advanced economies by 5 percent in the long term\u2014 and globally by 8 percent due to international spillovers. The associated fiscal cost is 0.4 percent of GDP per year (IMF 2016b). 22. Research covering the period since 1980 shows that large U.S. firms have shifted away from basic scientific research and toward more applied R&D (Arora and others 2015). In the United States, the government now funds about a quarter of all R&D but 60 percent of basic scientific research. The corresponding figures for OECD as a whole are about 30 percent and three- quarters, respectively (OECD R&D Statistics Database: www . oecd . org / sti / rds). 23. Three often-mentioned examples are the Internet, Google's basic search algo - rithm, and several key features of Apple smartphones (such as the GPS positioning, Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 221 touchscreen, the HTML language, and voice- activated virtual assistant), which had their roots in U.S. government- supported research and defense- related research proj ects. 24. Ideas such as government acquiring equity stakes are not without contro - versy. Government stakes could be \"passive\" and temporary, with the research in - vestments focused in priority areas that entail high risks that private investors would not take on their own, and managed by in de pen dent entities shielded from day- to- day po liti cal pressures. 25. The pace of improvement of educational attainment slowed across advanced and emerging economies during the 2000s, and an IMF study estimates that this weakening of human capital accumulation lowered labor productivity growth in these economies on average by 0.3 percentage points per year during that period (Adler and others 2017). An OECD study documents rising skill mismatches in OECD economies and estimates that reducing skill mismatches can lift labor pro - ductivity on the order of 10 percent in economies where the mismatches are par - ticularly high (Adalet McGowan and Andrews 2015). 26. Besides, some other studies come up with much lower estimates of the pro - portion of jobs that may actually be automated. For example, based on an analy sis covering forty- six countries representing 80 percent of global workforce, McKin - sey Global Institute (2017a) estimates that the proportion of occupations that can be automated entirely by currently demonstrated technology is less than 5 percent. It estimates that partial automation can affect more jobs: about 60 percent of all occupations have at least 30 percent of activities that are technically automatable. McKinsey Global Institute (2017b) develops vari ous scenarios up to 2030 that yield a midpoint estimate of about 15 percent for work activities that could be displaced. 27. Including, for example, by such illustrious economists as Keynes (1930) and Leontief (1952). 28. In a study of twenty- eight industries for eigh teen OECD countries between 1970 and 2007, Autor and Salomons (2018) find that the net effect of technological change on employment was, in fact, marginally positive rather than substantially negative. Job losses in individual industries implementing labor- displacing but productivity- enhancing technologies were more than offset by positive spillover effects of higher productivity on jobs elsewhere in the economy through inter- industry input- output effects (what they call \"Costco effects\") and demand effects (what they call \"Walmart effects\"). They find, however, that technological change did contribute to the observed decline in labor income shares. Acemoglu and Re - strepo (2018a) estimate that about half of the total employment growth in the United States between 1980 and 2007 is explained by additional employment growth in occupations with new job titles, relative to a benchmark category with no new job titles (using new job titles as a proxy for new jobs). McKinsey Global Institute (2017a) estimates that one- third of new jobs created in the United States 222 productive equity in the past twenty- five years were types that did not exist, or barely existed, before\u2014in areas including IT development, hardware manufacturing, app creation, and IT systems management. 29. In these accounts, workers can save some tax- deferred income annually that employers can match (Holzer 2017). 30. This is the case even in many advanced economies. In the United States, for example, the enrollment rate of four- year-olds in early childhood education is only around 70 percent (OECD 2016b). A high- quality early education program in the United States returns $7 to $12 in benefits to the individual and society for each $1 invested (Heckman and others 2010). For a broader review of evidence doc - umenting high payoff to early childhood interventions, see OECD (2017b). 31. In the United States, college enrollment and completion gaps by income level have increased over the past few de cades (Turner 2017). 32. See, for example, Aghion (2016) for a supportive commentary.

For a largely critical account, see Holzer (2017) and a survey of top economists at www . igmchicago . org / surveys / universal - basic - income. Dervi (2017) proposes a mixed system with a universal benefit com - bined with social policy guidance on its use.

The basic idea of a negative income tax has been around for a while; its intellectual genesis can be traced back to Milton Friedman and James Tobin. 36.

Recent research finds evidence of synergies between product and labor mar - ket reforms (IMF 2016c, Andrews and Saia 2017). 38. For example, the Freelancers Union in the United States and platform work - ers groups emerging in Eu rope. 39. Such as the German IG Metall with the FairCrowdWork or the German in - de pen dent ser vice union ver.di . 40. \"Predistribution,\" a term coined by Jacob Hacker (2011), embodies the idea that the state should try to prevent inequalities occurring in the first place rather Boosting Productivity and Reducing Inequality 223 than ameliorating inequalities through the tax and transfer system once they have occurred as happens under re distribution . Ricardo Hausmann (2015) draws a similar distinction between policies for re distribution and inclusion (in the growth pro cess). 41. This could take the form of levying contributions through a progressive in - come tax or using taxes that bear not only on labor income but possibly also on capital income and property. France, for example, levies social security contribu - tions on personal capital income. 42. For a sample of advanced and emerging economies, an IMF study estimated that reforms that removed tax- induced distortions in business decisions and strengthened tax administration could add up to one quarter of a percentage point to the GDP growth rate by improving resource allocation and boosting produc - tivity (IMF 2017b). 43. For economies with available data (mostly advanced economies and major emerging economies). 44. While Thomas Piketty's work on in equality (Piketty 2014) has attracted much controversy, one key proposal\u2014to find a better way to tax wealth\u2014 has merit. 45. In OECD countries, governments support 10 percent to 20 percent of business R&D through tax incentives and direct support such as grants and public procurement. At pres ent, such R&D support tends to favor incumbents and inad - equately benefits small and young innovative firms. R&D investment is highly concentrated in large firms (ranging from 65 percent in Canada to 85 percent in the United States and 95 percent in Japan) and these firms also receive the lion's share (more than 75 percent) of government R&D support (OECD R&D Statistics Database, www . oecd . org / sti / rds). 46. With technology causing more frequent shifts between jobs (and the asso - ciated increased need for reskilling) and giving rise to more in de pen dent work arrangements, targeting re(training) incentives directly to workers may be more effective than targeting incentives to firms (OECD 2017f).

As Dani Rodrik argues, for most issues, national policies are much more impor tant than what happens beyond borders (Rodrik 2017). Overall, that is still true. But international in - terdependence has increased and international cooperation has an impor - tant role as well. Global interdependence and spillover effects increasingly require national policies to be framed in a global context\u2014 intensifying the need for, and increasing potential rewards from, international cooperation. In a globalized world economy, rules of engagement at the international level, such as those governing international trade and investment and flows of skills and technology, matter more. So do arrangements for global eco - nomic governance. In the agenda ahead, reforms at national and international levels must play complementary, mutually supportive roles. The need for complemen - tarity between these reforms has been brought into sharper focus by the recent rise in populist po liti cal sentiment and a backlash against forces, no - tably globalization and technological change, that are seen to be associated This chapter was prepared with input from Dany Bahar and Zia Qureshi.234 productive equity with job losses and increased income in equality. Attempting to inhibit glo - balization or technological change would be the wrong response to the rising popu lar discontent with some of their impacts, as they are key forces that drive productivity and economic growth. Instead, policies must work with these forces and channel them to promote outcomes that are better for both growth and its inclusiveness. This includes rules of engagement at the international level that are ad - equate to the task of governing a more deeply interlinked world economy and are fair, complemented by policies at the national level that help firms and workers adjust to the challenges and opportunities that come with international integration and technological change. In the area of interna - tional trade, for example, the agenda includes ensuring an international trade system that provides a level playing field and reforming national policies to foster competition in domestic markets and support workers through retraining programs and social protection mechanisms to adapt to shifts in the demand for skills (IMF and others 2017). Policy reforms at the national level were addressed in the previous chapter. This chapter focuses on reforms at the international level. It considers areas for attention in improving policies and rules at the inter - national level that govern engagement between countries in trade, in - vestment, competition, transfer of technology, migration, and tax poli - cies. It also looks at the institutions of global economic governance and how they can be more effective in supporting better global economic and social outcomes. A recurring theme in the chapter is that global policymaking and insti - tutional frameworks have not kept pace with real ity. While much has been built in the past few de cades, global disciplines have been slow to respond to a changing agenda driven by advancing globalization, rapid technologi - cal change, and major structural transformations in the global economy (OECD 2017a). There has been an erosion of trust in policies and institu - tions. The perception is one of elite- driven institutions, with the elites often unable to explain in simple terms how these institutions function and why certain policies are being pursued. Against this background and the risks associated with an ascendant national pop u lism fed by growing societal dis - content with outcomes, the reform agenda and related debate acquire in - creased significance. International Cooperation and Global Governance 235 Making the International System Work Better and for All Over the last de cade, international trade and investment have been grow - ing more slowly, weighing down global productivity and growth. Policy fail - ures associated with official tolerance of creeping protectionism, neglect of fresh liberalization, and barriers to investment have contributed to these trends. The World Trade Organ ization (WTO) has been unable to keep the international trade agenda under its global multilateral umbrella, resulting in fragmented pro cesses. Weaknesses in international frameworks to en - sure fair competition and promote flow of knowledge have intensified in - equalities in the sharing of benefits from globalization and technological advancement. The digital revolution is posing new challenges for interna - tional cooperation in trade, investment, and competition policies. While shifts in labor supply and demand caused by demographic and technologi - cal change have brought migration issues more to the fore, policy responses and coordination mechanisms have been lagging. With increased capital mobility, international tax competition risks a race to the bottom in tax pol - icies across countries. These developments call for increased cooperation among nations on reforms that are responsive to the new challenges and make the interna - tional system work better and for all. Without attempting to be comprehen - sive, this chapter focuses on some areas where international cooperation is particularly impor tant. Promoting an Open and Fair Trade System International trade is a key driver of productivity growth. Export pene - tration makes firms more productive through exposure to competition and learning from foreign markets. Import penetration sharpens incen - tives for firms to become more efficient and improves access to quality intermediate goods. There are valid \"learning by doing\" type arguments to shield \"infant\" activities that have the potential to become competitive. The challenge is to avoid such rationale being used as a cover for pure pro - tectionism. Many high- performing countries have grown with some degree of protection from imports, but in many others protectionism contrib - uted to stagnation. It is also impor tant that trade agreements ensure real 236 productive equity competition and not become instruments for the expansion of global monopolies. Trade inevitably creates winners and losers. This distributional dimen - sion of trade has tended to be minimized by most economists under the correct premise that, on the aggregate, trade enhances welfare. But the dis - tributional impacts are impor tant and need addressing. Public debate, now perhaps more than ever, has shifted to revisiting the negative effects that trade can have in labor markets. For instance, Shushanik Hakobyan and John McLaren (2016) find that even if the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was welfare enhancing on the aggregate, wage growth for U.S. blue- collar workers in industries that experienced increased com - petition because of NAFTA slowed down considerably. David Autor and others (2013) find that import competition from China resulted in higher unemployment, lower wages, and lower labor participation in U.S. locations that were more exposed to it. Even though trade can explain only a relatively small part of the wage and job losses for low- skilled workers (capital- and skill- biased techno - logical change having been a much more impor tant factor), there has been a sharp rise in po liti cal forces using trade as a lightning rod to fuel an anti- globalization agenda. Developments such as Brexit, the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and the escalation of trade tensions between the United States and China are dramatic recent examples of the rise in nationalist po liti cal forces. But an anti- trade sentiment has been building for some time, reflected in rising protectionism. Between the onset of the global financial crisis and 2017, there were more than 9,000 policy interventions implemented worldwide that are considered harmful to trade, compared with around 3,500 liberalizing interventions.1 These harmful policies mostly consist of non- tariff barriers (NTBs) of an in - creasingly murky nature, such as nontransparent subsidies, domestic con - tent requirements, and public procurement discrimination (Hufbauer and Jung 2016). The po liti cal climate has become quite difficult for deepening the pro - cess of freeing global trade that started with the post- war Bretton Woods accord. The last major multilateral trade agreement, the Uruguay Round, dates back to 1994. The period since then has been marked mostly by re - gional trade agreements, the momentum of which also appears to have stalled recently. International Cooperation and Global Governance 237 The challenge ahead is to find a balanced approach that resists protec - tionism and pragmatically seeks opportunities for further opening up of trade, ensuring that trade rules are fair and promote true competition. There is much \"traditional\" trade agenda that remains, particularly in agriculture and ser vices, and there are new issues relating to regulatory harmonization and the fast- expanding digital trade. At the same time, policies at the na - tional level need to address the distributional impacts of trade much more seriously than they have in the past, including through retraining and so - cial protection policies for workers negatively affected by trade. Such poli - cies are needed not only to make openness work for all but to ensure the very sustainability of the pro gress on openness. While the world has taken major strides toward trade liberalization in terms of lowering tariffs since the inception of the GATT and the WTO, particularly in manufacturing, there is still a long road ahead in address - ing NTBs. Often NTBs take opaque, behind- the- border forms and are used to continue to protect industries that have experienced tariff reduction (WTO 2012). In the absence of adequate multilateral frameworks, coun - tries have attempted to address such barriers in bilateral and regional trade negotiations through provisions covering relevant domestic regulations. Here, policymakers face the challenge of balancing efforts to counter pro - tectionist use of domestic regulations with allowance of adequate policy space at the national level for regulatory structures to reflect legitimate dif - ferences in country circumstances and preferences. Two regulatory areas receiving increased attention in trade negotiations are labor and environmental standards, which aim to enforce basic rules to prevent unfair advantages in trade. Between 1994 and 2016, there were seventy- seven trade agreements, involving 136 countries, that included some labor provisions (ILO 2016). Agreeing on a minimum set of core labor stan - dards is challenging, but this will be an impor tant issue in the global trade agenda going forward. The same can be said about the challenge of agree - ing on a set of core environmental standards. Digital trade is now the most dynamic component of international com - merce, and appropriate disciplines covering this trade are crucial to the broad diffusion of today's cutting- edge digital technologies. These technolo - gies matter increasingly for productivity and economic growth. Interna - tionally agreed rules are needed to ensure free flow of data across borders, support digital intellectual property rights that reward innovation but 238 productive equity prevent monopolies, address cybersecurity issues, and provide for dis - pute settlement. One way forward is for such rules to be negotiated in a plurilateral digital trade agreement among a critical mass of WTO mem - bers that would be open on a most- favored- nation basis to all countries (Meltzer 2016). A promising recent step in that direction was the setting up of a working group of about seventy WTO members at the WTO Min - isterial Conference in Buenos Aires in December 2017 to initiate explor - atory work on future negotiations on trade- related aspects of electronic commerce. All in all, despite the recent surge in anti- globalization po liti cal senti - ment, it is impor tant to recognize how crucial international trade has been in fostering productivity and growth across all nations while also acknowl - edging trade's distributional consequences within countries that policies must be responsive to. In the current po liti cal environment, it is difficult to envisage new comprehensive global trade agreements backed by all 160- plus WTO members. Yet, if we care about growth, more, not less, trade is the answer. Each country will decide whether it wishes to engage in bilateral, regional, or global efforts. While agreements among a subset of countries can enhance trade, it is desirable that they remain within the multilateral rules framework of the WTO and are open to others. Plurilateral agree - ments should be seen as \"moving ahead while others catch up,\" not as a patchwork of trade blocks. Improving the Framework for Cross- Border Investment Flows Together with trade, cross- border investment flows can boost productivity and growth by promoting technological diffusion, augmenting competi - tion, and improving the allocation of global savings. International trade and investment have become increasingly intertwined. In the new world of global value chains (GVCs), multinational corporations, the parents of foreign direct investment (FDI), account for around 80 percent of world exports. Yet despite this ever- tighter linkage between trade and invest - ment, an adequate multilateral framework of rules governing international investment is lacking. Unlike the WTO- led global framework of rules governing trade, for - eign investment is guided mainly by piecemeal international investment agreements negotiated by individual countries or country groups. These International Cooperation and Global Governance 239 agreements, which vary in content and are mostly bilateral, now number more than 3,300. At the multilateral level, there is only a partial patchwork of investment rules within the WTO, which date back to the Uruguay Round.2 This creates a regime that is fragmentary and lacks coherence, which can impede and distort investment flows. Across countries, openness to foreign investment is uneven between sec - tors, with some sectors, such as ser vices and network industries, typically less open. Within countries, behind- the- border impediments to foreign in - vestment remain large. These factors keep foreign investment from realiz - ing its full potential contribution to global productivity and growth. FDI flows in recent years have been running between 2 percent to 2.5 percent of world GDP, well below their peak prior to the global financial crisis. Given a more conducive environment, FDI could possibly double from its current level (World Economic Forum 2013, UNCTAD 2017a). At the same time, foreign investment by global quasi- monopolies can frustrate entry by national newcomers, so it is impor tant that investment agreements are designed well and are not used as vehicles that facilitate the maintenance of mono poly positions by the giants of the digital age. Efforts were made in the early 2000s to develop multilateral rules on for - eign investment and a WTO Working Group on the Relationship between Trade and Investment was established. However, these efforts were soon abandoned for lack of pro gress. Despite the current challenging environ - ment for international policymaking, conditions may be more favorable now for the development of a multilateral framework for investment. The growth of GVCs and the tighter trade- investment nexus sharpens the need for more integrated trade and investment disciplines governing interna - tional supply chains. Besides the mono poly potentials mentioned, in - creased FDI flows by state- owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds pres ent new challenges. The North- South divide that bedev iled previous ef - forts at developing a multilateral framework for investment is disappear - ing. Emerging economies are now playing a much bigger role in FDI as both host and home countries, accounting for around half of all FDI inflows and 30 percent of outflows. A set of Guiding Princi ples for Global Investment Policymaking was endorsed by the G20 group of major advanced and emerging economies at their summit in Hangzhou in 2016, with the objec - tive of fostering an open, transparent, and conducive global policy environ - ment for investment (G20 2016). Even though the princi ples are broad and 240 productive equity nonbinding, this is an encouraging development that can pave the way for further pro gress at the multilateral level. Consideration should be given to reviving the WTO Working Group on investment. A multilateral agreement on investment open to all WTO mem - bers could initially start with a group of countries that are willing to go ahead. Besides provisions on issues such as investor protection, access, na - tional treatment, and dispute settlement, a multilateral framework could incorporate provisions on corporate- social responsibility and sustainabil - ity drawing on useful recent work on these issues\u2014 such as UNCTAD's Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development (UNCTAD 2015, Sauvant 2016). International cooperation on an investment framework needs to ex - tend beyond regulation to facilitation to remove obstacles to investment at the domestic level, through more transparent and predictable invest - ment governance regimes, modernized investment information systems and administrative pro cesses, and assistance to countries in these areas. As discussed in the previous chapter, boosting sound investment is a key part of the agenda to revive productivity and foster more robust eco - nomic growth, and global investment needs are large for infrastructure development and the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals more broadly. Multilateral investment facilitation efforts acquire in - creased significance in this context. In the trade area, the 2013 WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement was an impor tant step forward. A multilat - eral agreement on investment facilitation would complement and en - hance the trade facilitation agreement. There are some promising recent steps to build on, including the Global Action Menu for Investment Facili - tation launched by the UNCTAD in 2016 and the Informal Dialogue on Investment Facilitation initiated by the WTO in 2017 (UNCTAD 2017b, WTO 2017). Promoting Fair Competition and Improving Policies on Intellectual Property Rights As in the case of investment, development of a multilateral framework on competition policies has been a challenge. In a landmark study of global competition policy, Edward Graham and David Richardson (1997) wrote that, because of increasing integration of economies and business organ - International Cooperation and Global Governance 241 izations across national bound aries, \" there is growing consensus among in - ternational trade negotiators and policymakers that a prime area for future multilateral discussion is competition policy.\" Yet, two de cades later, agree - ment on multilateral rules on competition has remained elusive. In the interim, not only has globalization advanced much further, but digital technologies have given rise to a new class of superstar multinational firms that are causing market concentration to rise across many economies in technology- related industries. Digital platforms and digital activity today are the fastest growing ele ment of global flows (McKinsey Global Institute 2016a). Cross- border M&As have multiplied, as have cases of cross- border cartel- like practices.3 Concerns about the lack of a level playing field in in - ternational competition are adding to the backlash against trade and the rise in protectionist sentiment. If global competition issues were considered impor tant two de cades ago, they are even more so now. International com - petition policy has increasingly lagged behind the challenges associated with a more globalized and networked economy. The fundamental synergy between trade and competition policies and the importance of fair competition to inclusive trade liberalization are gen - erally recognized. Foreign investment and competition policies also are closely linked. There is a strong conceptual argument for an integrated, holistic multilateral framework for international trade, foreign investment, and competition policies that have international effects (Baldwin 2016). Views differ widely, however, on the precise approaches and modalities for incorporating competition issues in multilateral rules. A broad inter - national agreement on competition policy also faces the challenge of con - tinuing significant divergences in competition policies and pro cesses across economies despite pro gress on convergence over the years, especially across economies at di ff er ent levels of development. In the absence of tangible pro gress toward an agreement within the mul - tilateral framework of the WTO, international competition policy issues have been addressed mainly through bilateral and regional trade agree - ments that have included clauses dealing with harmonization of competi - tion policies and establishment of consultative mechanisms. The Eu ro pean Union has made the most pro gress toward developing a common interna - tional competition policy regime covering its members. International com - petition disciplines also form part of the two major cross- regional trade negotiations where pro gress has recently stalled, namely the Trans- Pacific 242 productive equity Partnership (TPP) and the Trans- Atlantic Trade and Investment Partner - ship (TTIP). A multilateral agreement on competition policy would be highly de - sirable. However, given divergent country views, the prospect for a WTO agreement covering all members is currently remote. In the meantime, further pro gress through plurilateral agreements among subsets of WTO members and through informal networks of national competition author - ities (notably the International Competition Network) offers the best prospect for progressive advancement toward an eventual global framework. Key issues concern cross- border M&As and cartels, national treatment of for - eign enterprises, competitive neutrality between state- owned and private enterprises, new competition policy challenges in digital trade, and inter - national consultation and dispute settlement mechanisms (Hufbauer and Kim 2008, Bergsten and others 2014, P\u00e9rez- Motta 2016, Marin 2017). There is also a need for capacity- building assistance to countries with less developed competition institutions. The G20 group of major economies can provide po liti cal leadership on the international competition policy agenda, as it is beginning to do on international investment policy, sup - ported by the technical work of organ izations such as the OECD and the UNCTAD. Alongside competition policies, there is the need to improve interna - tional cooperation on intellectual property in a world where ideas, knowl - edge, and information are increasingly impor tant drivers of economic activity. As discussed in the previous chapter, there are growing concerns that overly broad and stringent national patent systems are impeding in - novation and its diffusion and hurting competition. Similar concerns arise at the international level. National intellectual property regimes and related international frameworks may, therefore, need a significant recali - bration (Baker and others 2017). They also need to adapt to the new innova - tion dynamics of digital technologies (Curtis 2016). Unlike competition policies, a formal multilateral framework does exist for intellectual property rights, centered around the Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) administered by the WTO. This could provide a foundation for further international coop - erative action, based on an approach that provides more open access and more room for new entry and less protection for the big, entrenched play - ers. Related to this, there are proposals to include research ser vices in GATS International Cooperation and Global Governance 243 and establish an Agreement on Access to Basic Science and Technology aimed at strengthening the global commons in science and technology without unduly restricting private rights in commercial technologies (Doherty and others 2016). Developing Sensible Policies on Migration Policies relating to international mobility of labor also play an impor tant role in the diffusion of know-how and technology. For example, cross- border patent citations are more likely to occur when inventors across borders are ethnically related (Kerr 2008). A study of India finds that teams man - aged by returning mi grants file disproportionately more patents than teams with local man ag ers (Choudhury 2016). Migration can also strengthen trade networks; one study finds that mi grants contribute to the emergence of new exports in receiving countries that are competitively marketed to sending countries (Bahar and Rapoport 2018). Firms do not adopt new technologies and orga nizational knowledge simply by acquiring a blue - print or buying new machinery; often the pro cess involves bringing in new skills and know-how in the form of new workers. A lot of knowledge is tacit, and its transmission requires human interactions. International migration can be an impor tant part of this transmission, or \"brain turn - over,\" across borders. Migration policies are a matter of much public debate. Some would argue in favor of full cross- border labor mobility, like the kind that exists within the Eu ro pean Union. In theory, free movement of people should be welfare enhancing, similar to free movement of goods and capital. Several recent studies document the sizable potential economic benefits of migration from spurring technology diffusion and innovation and alleviating imbalances in labor/skill supply and demand (IMF 2016, McKinsey Global Institute 2016b). Yet, as with other cross- border flows, there are concerns about winners and losers and distributional impacts. Moreover, cultural issues arise, especially when migration involves large flows of relatively unskilled people. Balancing these considerations makes migration a particularly chal - lenging area for policymaking. One area is policies regarding temporary migration, which may be po - liti cally less contentious than permanent migration. A global framework to incentivize migration could start by facilitating temporary work visas 244 productive equity between countries. Work visas, even if temporary, can encounter po liti cal opposition, requiring numbers to be regulated. For example, countries could bilaterally negotiate the scope of a program of reciprocal work visas for skilled workers. A more ambitious approach could involve negotiating temporary work visa quotas among countries at the plurilateral or global level. Under Mode 4 of the GATS, the WTO already provides some multi - lateral framework that deals with cross- border movement of natu ral per - sons. As it stands, this framework is limited in scope, but it can underpin the development of more ambitious approaches. One in ter est ing approach is a tradable quota system of the kind sug Fernandez- Huertas Moraga and Hillel Rapoport (2014) to deal with the refugee crisis. Countries would agree on a quota allocation system to accept refugees based on certain par ameters, and they would sub - sequently be able to trade the quotas in a manner similar to the carbon emission quotas under the Kyoto Protocol. Such tradability would make the quota system more flexible and accommodative of national preferences. While conceived initially in the context of the refugee issues in Eu rope, the basic model could be applied to the design of temporary work visas for cer - tain categories of workers at a more global level among interested coun - tries. Another proposal is for interested countries, working through the GATS, to establish a plurilateral but open \"innovation zone\" within which technical personnel would be able to move freely over agreed multiyear pe - riods (Doherty and others 2016). Through knowledge transfers, entrepreneurship, and other benefits, countries typically gain from having their skilled mi grants return home. Mi grants are more likely to become entrepreneurs. While mi grants ac - count for about 15 percent of the U.S. population, they account for more than 25 percent of entrepreneurs in the country (Kerr and others 2016). Policies to incentivize citizens to return are, naturally, at the discretion of each country. These could include, for example, fiscal benefits such as temporary tax exemptions or access to risk capital for new ventures. These policies could be targeted to par tic u lar occupations that are in high demand by growing sectors. Fiscal resources used for this purpose are likely to be recovered through fiscal contributions from the returnees later on.4 As the aging of populations in advanced economies continues and the skilled workforce\u2014 with a digital- age education\u2014 grows in many emerging International Cooperation and Global Governance 245 economies, the forces of income convergence will strengthen and the terms of the debate on migration are likely to shift (Ahmed and others 2017). In the near term, however, the pressure from low- income, low- skill potential mi grants will continue to rise. Alongside other policies, there is an impor - tant role here for policies that encourage investment in source countries that improves prospects for gainful employment there. Returns on such proj - ects can be high, but so can the variance of these returns given associated risks. Risk- pooling and de- risking instruments can be particularly helpful in catalyzing more such investment. Enhancing Cooperation on Tax Policies Globalization has enhanced the need for international cooperation in tax matters, as it makes it easier to shift income and assets offshore and increases the cross- border spillover effects of tax policy actions of national tax juris - dictions. Attention has recently focused, in par tic u lar, on the shifting of profits by multinational corporations away from countries where they are generated to tax havens with lower or no taxes. In recent years, such profit shifting by U.S. multinational groups has been estimated in the range of 25 percent to 30 percent of gross corporate profits (Cobham and Jansk\u00fd 2015). Globally, tax revenue losses from profit shifting and related tax base erosion were conservatively estimated at around $600 billion in 2013 (Crivelli and others 2015). This consisted of around $400 billion in loss for OECD countries and $200 billion for non- OECD countries.5 In addi - tion to corporate tax base erosion, international tax competition to at - tract more mobile corporate income and investment has contributed to a very pronounced decline in corporate tax rates; the mean statutory cor - porate income tax rate in OECD countries has fallen by almost one- half over the past three de cades. Revenue losses and distortions resulting from these effects entail negative implications for both longer- term growth and equity. International cooperation in combating cross- border tax avoidance and evasion has been a brighter spot in the recent rec ord of global economic governance. Led by the G20 and supported by the OECD, two impor tant initiatives have been launched. First, in 2014 at the G20 summit in Bris - bane, the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) reporting standard was established to improve transparency and exchange of information for 246 productive equity tax purposes. The AEOI standard requires automatic exchange of information on financial accounts between participating tax jurisdictions. It upgrades the earlier standard of exchange of information on request (EOIR) that had been instituted soon after the global financial crisis. Second, in 2015 at the G20 summit in Antalya, an initiative was launched to combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), which aims to improve and standardize tax codes, treaties, and data sharing to ensure that profits are taxed where economic activities generating the profits are performed and value is cre - ated. Since the launch of these initiatives, notable pro gress has been made in setting up implementation arrangements. More than one hundred countries and jurisdictions so far have committed to the AEOI and BEPS initiatives (OECD 2017c, Global Forum 2017). Looking ahead, strong implementation will be crucial, including put - ting in place national and international legal and regulatory frameworks required to deliver on the commitments made. Capacity- building support to emerging economies will be particularly impor tant to enable their ef - fective participation in these international initiatives. This should form part of broader efforts to build these countries' tax capacities, with support from institutions such as the IMF, the OECD, and the World Bank. Within the BEPS framework, further work is needed to develop some key ele ments, including those relating to transfer pricing and taxation of the digital economy. Moreover, dispute prevention and resolution mechanisms need to be further developed (IMF and OECD 2017). Another area where stronger international cooperation will be needed is carbon taxation. Taxing carbon emissions is a vital reform for climate sustainability, which can also boost productivity and longer- term growth by spurring innovation and investment in new technologies. It can gener - ate sizable revenues, as well, that can be put to good uses. Coordinated in - ternational action on pricing carbon emissions can boost collective pro gress by alleviating individual country concerns about potential negative impli - cations for their competitiveness of unilateral action.6 Some countries may consider imposing border tax adjustments on imports from trading part - ners with no or weaker carbon pricing regimes, though these adjustments can raise complex issues. Clearer guidance on such border tax adjustments will need to be developed within the WTO framework. There is an impor - tant role here also for support to poorer countries as they develop their cli - mate policies, which can promote consistency of actions across countries International Cooperation and Global Governance 247 and expedite pro gress toward convergence of carbon prices (Commission on Carbon Prices 2017). A Medium- Term Vision for Global Economic Governance The concrete reforms outlined here could go a long way in improving how the global \"system\" works. It must be acknowledged, however, that the adoption of many such reforms faces major obstacles in today's po liti cal climate. Beyond technical proposals there is the broader issue of what is perceived as legitimate, how citizens around the world relate to interna - tional institutions and to the nature of global markets. If global markets and players are not embedded in institutions that have the support of citi - zens, a retreat to old- style nationalism may seem to be the only alternative. The coming de cades will be a period of huge technological changes impacting all socie ties and markets. Legitimacy will take on new dimen - sions. What will be the legal framework for markets being transformed by digital trade, for access to and use of big data, and for cybersecurity? Sci - entific advances are not limited to digital technologies, of course. Bio/ genetic- engineering, for example, is another potentially big area of change. Another phenomenon is the rise of global business giants in a world of global value chains and digital globalization. As noted, around 80 percent of world trade now takes place in value chains linked to transnational cor - porations. Eight technology giants account for about a third of the market capitalization of the world's one hundred most valuable companies (Wolf 2017). What are the implications of this world of change for global gover - nance? What will be considered \"legitimate\" in this new world? Answers to these questions have great importance for growth and eq - uity. There are no ready answers to these big questions. They will have to evolve gradually from scientific and economic realities and politics. Here, we give a brief overview of what kind of global governance has taken shape and how it can be improved, especially from the perspective of legitimacy. National and international markets need to be embedded in institutions that help them work efficiently and fairly (Ruggie 2008). It took centuries to embed national markets in national institutions. It will take time before the new types of markets that are developing on a global scale become embedded in global institutions that reflect the twenty- first century.248 productive equity There has long been tension between individual citizens and nation- states in the visions about global governance and international coopera - tion. After the disastrous three de cades from 1914 to 1945 when extreme nationalism led the world to experience the biggest catastrophes of mod - ern history, there was a desire to construct an international system that could prevent similar disasters. There was also a certain willingness to look beyond the nation- state when discussing what democracy was all about. The San Francisco Declaration leading to the creation of the United Nations contained the words \"we the peoples,\" although it was a declaration by nation- states (United Nations 1945). The Eu ro pean Union of today was built with a vision that went beyond the nation- state. Thus the vision of post- World War II global governance included two \"constituent units\" of governance: \"nation- states\" and \" peoples.\" Granted, nobody was seriously thinking of setting up a world government, nor should we be thinking of it now. Governance is a much \"softer\" concept and harder to define than government. It leaves open the question of how much actual decisionmaking is implied in governance. Governance is defined as \"all of the pro cesses of governing, whether undertaken by a government, market or network, whether over a family, tribe, formal or informal organ ization or territory and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an or ga nized society\" (Bevir 2013). This definition captures well the multi- actor nature of governance. But by re - ferring explic itly to the pro cesses of governing, it can exaggerate the im - plementation ability of governance. Instead, it would be more accurate to refer to the \"pro cesses of governing, proposing or influencing.\" What con - cept of \"governance\" will be relevant in the twenty- first century? The closer global governance comes to an actual decisionmaking and implementation concept, the greater is the dilemma of the \"constituent unit.\" One extreme view is to stick to the nation- state as the sole constitu - ent unit. When that view is combined with commitment to equality among constituent units, we get the one- nation one- vote princi ple, as embodied in the General Assembly of the United Nations (UNGA). Malta, Rus sia, and the United States each have one vote in the UNGA, irrespective of the number of their citizens, the size of their territory, their GDP, and so on. Each one is a nation- state and, therefore, a constituent unit of the \"demo - cratic\" international system. International Cooperation and Global Governance 249 This is problematic, not least from the point of view of democracy. The one- person one- vote princi ple is a bedrock of democracy. So how can Malta with its population of 440,000 have the same weight as the United States with a population of more than 320 million? There is another issue that reflects the tension between democracy and the one- nation one- vote rule. If one is committed to democracy, one could argue that the nation- states' decision power can only have legitimacy if the nation- state in question is a democracy. This issue is not clear- cut, however, as there are many forms of \"democracy,\" including constitutional monarchies, some of which are, in effect, more demo cratic than many democracies in name only. Going to the other extreme would bring us to a system of one- person one- vote at the global level\u2014in fact, to a global democracy. While concep - tually easy to understand and reflecting at the global level the one- person one- vote princi ple at the national level, such a system would be as infeasi - ble in the 2020s as it was in 1945. Perhaps even more so, because in 1945 the ravages of nationalism were fresh in every one's mind, while today nationalism is making a comeback. All international institutions face these tensions related to legitimacy. While the UNGA is governed by the one- nation one- vote rule, the UN Security Council (UNSC) is governed by a much smaller group of fifteen nations, with ten rotating elected members and five permanent members\u2014 the P-5 consisting of the key victors of World War II, including China, France, Rus sia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Each of the P-5 nations was granted a veto right. Except for some intra- UN administrative and bud getary matters, all impor tant po liti cal and economic decisions (for example, sanctions) could be taken only by the UNSC. Thus, a com - promise was struck between the one- nation one- vote princi ple, or democ - racy with nations as constituent units, and \"real politik\" reflecting real military and economic power. The compromise struck was far less than perfect. To give any one power an absolute veto right later led to a great deal of dysfunctionality of the United Nations. Moreover, because any one of the P-5 has a veto power, it has been difficult to reform the system from within. The GATT, which later metamorphosed into the WTO, followed the one- nation one- vote rule but with the added understanding that decisions were to be made by consensus, in theory allowing any one member to 250 productive equity derail an agreement. In practice, there were escape clauses such as the differentiated treatment of developing countries, but the fundamental consensus- oriented governance of the GATT/WTO did not change. As dis - cussed, moving forward on today's dynamic trade agenda will require more flexible approaches, including seeking eventual multilateral outcomes initially through pragmatic plurilateral agreements. The rules- based trad - ing system underpinned by the WTO is a key strength of the global economy. The WTO's trade- focused mandate now needs to be broadened to reflect the much more strongly interwoven nature of trade, investment, competition policies, and intellectual property rights. Instead, today's po liti cal dynam - ics threaten to weaken the WTO. The Bretton Woods Institutions\u2014 the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank\u2014 were set up quite differently although they were and re - main specialized agencies of the United Nations. The governance of these institutions tried to reconcile nation- states as constituent units of the in - ternational system with the in equality of nation- states' economic power through a weighted- voting governance system. Given the economic focus of these institutions, the weights in their governance reflected economic and financial variables such as GDP and trade. As time passed, the weights be - came outdated and unfair, failing to reflect the changing economic size of countries, and the institutions have been in the pro cess of adjusting the weights. But the fundamental nature of the system of weighting nation- states has not been questioned. Regional development banks, which comple - ment the global World Bank and play a similar role at the regional level, also have weighted- voting governance structures. The question is often raised whether, given the increased size of private capital flows, the \"official\" development banks (the World Bank and its sister regional banks) are still needed. Their size relative to total capital flows has shrunk quite dramatically. The IMF, too, is now much smaller in relative terms. The answer to this question is that there remains a large need for risk pooling and maturity lengthening for investments in many parts of the world (Bhattacharya and others 2016). Individual proj ects in climate- friendly infrastructure, in par tic u lar, often appear very risky because of regulatory and po liti cal prob lems and their long- term nature. Development banks can help leverage financing through risk pooling and mitigation. Their role is particularly impor tant in supporting investments in global public goods, such as combating climate change and pandemics. International Cooperation and Global Governance 251 The IMF has a di ff er ent role, but that role also is linked to risk pooling. It is costly for countries to self- insure by accumulating large amounts of foreign exchange reserves. Access to IMF finance can reduce that cost. There has been much debate on the modalities of such access, but the basic princi - ple remains. Another impor tant role for the IMF in the absence of a for - mal sovereign debt restructuring pro cess has been to provide some of the coordination among creditors that formal or informal debt restructuring requires. A critique of the IMF's macro- model over de cades has been that it took supply as largely given, so deficit reduction and debt sustainability depended mainly on fiscal tightening. This has changed, and the IMF's mac - roeconomic approach has become more sophisticated, with supply and demand seen as interdependent. Nonetheless, as was shown again in the case of Greece, the IMF tends to underestimate the contractionary multi - pliers of fiscal tightening. This in no small mea sure reflects the reflexes of the past and the still-disproportionate weight of big creditor countries on the IMF's board. With the economic crisis of 2008 came the creation, at the level of heads of government, of the G20, a self- selected group of nineteen large econo - mies and the Eu ro pean Union. The group is not a formal organ ization; there is no voting and no secretariat, but a rotating presidency. It functions as a plurilateral convening forum and platform of major economies that pro - vides po liti cal impetus to work on par tic u lar economic issues, such as se - curing financial stability or tackling tax base erosion, to be implemented at the nation- state level or through international organ izations. It was in - strumental in the establishment of the Financial Stability Board to improve and coordinate global financial sector policies. The G20 has also sought to steer thinking and action on broader issues of global reform, such as con - vening an Eminent Persons Group in 2017 to advise on reform of global financial governance. The international governance architecture also includes many regional po liti cal organ izations, with the Eu ro pean Union standing out as the one having attempted the most daring steps toward governance beyond the nation- state. With re spect to the EU, it is in ter est ing to note that for decisions that do not require una nim i ty, a double majority of 55 percent of member nation- states representing at least 65 percent of EU's population is required. In broad brushstrokes, such is today's \"official\" system of global gover - nance. It is the one in place that will have to deal with the big challenges, such 252 productive equity as the digital revolution and digital globalization, the rise of a knowledge- driven intangible economy, cybersecurity, masses of data including false data (\"information apocalypse\"), climate change, and more. Technological change and globalized markets offer tremendous opportunities but are likely to amplify today's already large economic and social disparities without a rules- based system where one objective of the rules is to deliver greater inclusive - ness. Superpowers are likely to have massive destructive power, enough to annihilate humanity many times over, but often limited power in imposing their will on the ground. In 2025 China and the United States are going to be the two juggernauts, unless the Eu ro pean Union finds a way to move toward much greater integration. One can reasonably expect that the superpowers will cooperate on many issues, but can an open clash resulting from a miscal - culation or megalomania be altogether excluded? To strengthen and reform the global governance system, the \"big actors,\" such as the United States, China, and Eu rope, will have to be supportive. What ever their pronouncements are today, all three have, in fact, an interest in an inclusive and legitimate system because all three benefit from an open and reasonably harmonious system and would suffer if global gover - nance became fragmented and unable to function under a broadly unified set of rules. This may not have been the case for China in the past, but with its current size and the stakes it has in the global economy, it is not sur - prising that China has become a vocal supporter of globalization. China will insist, however, on having its weight correctly reflected in the weighted voting schemes of international institutions. The same will be the case with other emerging \"big actors,\" such as India. This does not mean that all will necessarily be operating under identical rules. Di ff er ent countries and re - gions of the world may have di ff er ent preferences about how they or ga nize and manage aspects of their economies, and the international system will need to accommodate that in a way that di ff er ent regimes can coexist with - out harming one another. Fi nally, alongside the \"official\" system, there are many non- state actors, including private and nongovernmental organ izations. They have no for - mal po liti cal power but a lot of po liti cal influence and are an increasingly impor tant component of governance. Among these non- state actors, today's mega- corporations are a dominant force. The challenges ahead are huge. A natu ral reaction to such thoughts is to think of other, more manageable prob lems. Paul Krugman once observed that International Cooperation and Global Governance 253 the three biggest issues in one's life are long- term career choices, lifestyles impacting health, and one's love life (Krugman 1997). People may wake up on a Sunday morning thinking of these but quickly decide to fix some minor prob lem in their basement. Yet the big prob lems will not go away. Multi- Level and Multi- Channel Governance It would be presumptuous to attempt to describe in any detail at the end of this report a blueprint for future global governance that would foster pro - ductive equity (the report's theme) and relative peace. We can, however, put forward some broad princi ples that may be helpful. First, governance will have to be seen and analyzed as a multi- level and multi- channel phenomenon; multi- level in the sense that there are and will be many levels of governance: communes, cities, metropolitan areas, re - gions, nation- states, multi- state regions such as the EU, and the world. Recognition of the multi- level nature of governance often leads to greater empowerment of the local level\u2014 the subsidiarity princi ple as applied to the global stage. Because many citizens feel lost in the vast ocean of globaliza - tion, they need a greater feeling of local owner ship and control, where feasible. Governance will be multi- channel in the sense that many of the \"offi - cial\" levels interact with \"nonofficial\" or private organ izations, ranging from private business groups to vari ous NGOs\u2014 not in government but in gov - ernance. Some of these nonofficial groups will dwarf many nation- states in resources and reach. The nation- state will remain a predominant player but cede some of its functions wholly or partially to the other levels and channels. This multi- level and multi- channel form of governance will take many diff er ent forms in di ff er ent places. What is impor tant is that it be recog - nized and discussed as such. It would be pointless to discuss global gover - nance without reference to and analy sis of the role of the private sector. But this implies that the governance of the nonofficial sector itself should be part of the debate. What should shareholder rights be? Should workers be rep - resented in private firms' owner ship and governance? Given the global nature of large firms, should there be global rules for their governance and how they compete? Answers to these questions will have impor tant impli - cations for the distribution of power and income.254 productive equity In the \"official\" sphere, it should be acknowledged more broadly that weighted voting is the way to bridge the gap between one- state one- vote de - mocracy and one- person one- vote democracy. This princi ple needs to be applied more widely to help international and regional organ izations ac - quire greater legitimacy. A big step forward would be to have the United Nations accept the weighted- voting princi ple in the Security Council. This could be achieved in steps. As is the case in the IMF and the World Bank, one or more countries could retain de facto veto power by requiring cer - tain decisions to be taken with a large percentage of the weighted vote. But once the weighting is accepted, there would at last be a way for the system to move forward, either by an explicit decision to change the weights or by the historical evolution of the weights. There is no reason the same princi - ple should not apply to the WTO, although the weights could be quite dif - fer ent. What goes into par tic u lar weights would, of course, be subject to much debate. But as the Eu ro pean Union and the Bretton Woods institu - tions have shown, agreement is pos si ble. The role of a grouping such as the G20 in all this would be that of a fa - cilitator, as it has been so far in areas such as finance and cross- border tax cooperation. The G20 has no explicit po liti cal legitimacy of its own, but given its membership it can lead and achieve reforms supported by the tech - nical work of vari ous international organ izations. Given the arbitrary composition of the G20, one could well ask whether it should continue in its pres ent form. If it had formal or legal decision making power, the an - swer should be in the negative. But precisely because it does not, it is prob - ably not worth trying to change its composition. In many areas, the official and nonofficial spheres explic itly debate and sometimes even decide in mixed forums. Just as the private sector should accept repre sen ta tion in its governance of stakeholders other than capital owners, the public sector should accept private sector participation in some of its governance pro cesses. An example is the proposal put forward by Manfred Elsig, on behalf of the WEF- ICTSD expert group on the function - ing of the WTO, to establish a formal Business Advisory Council at the WTO (Elsig 2016). The private sector is already involved in many of the of - ficial pro cesses, so this is not a radical or new proposal, but it is impor tant to recognize and broaden this involvement; it reflects real ity on the ground. This does not mean, however, that we should forget that government, as opposed to governance, is \"official\" by the very nature of democracy. The International Cooperation and Global Governance 255 Enlightenment and the French and American revolutions brought us democracy based on the one- person one- vote princi ple, although at the beginning who was a person entitled to vote was restricted (by gender, race, property). Not without reason, citizens around the world won der whether globalization is not fundamentally undermining democracy. That is what Dani Rodrik captured in his \"po liti cal trilemma of the world economy\"\u2014 the difficulty of reconciling national sovereignty, democ - racy, and global economic integration (Rodrik 2011). The discussion here has tried to show that there is, in fact, quite a bit of global governance, albeit in need of improvement. The new big issues ahead will test the global governance system and re - quire reforms, but it would be folly to argue for tossing it out. There does not appear to be a radically di ff er ent architecture that would be clearly su - perior. What is needed is to put in place improvements and empower citi - zens around the world to participate in the debate. An improved system building on what we have will be sorely needed in the years ahead as sci - ence opens up new opportunities but also carries new risks for humanity. Notes 1.

This includes the Agreement on Trade- Related Investment Mea sures (TRIMs) and the \"commercial presence\" mode in the General Agreement on Trade in Ser - vices (GATS). These rules are limited in scope and do not provide a comprehen - sive regulatory framework for foreign investment at the multilateral level. 3. Between 1990 and 2015, 240 cross- border cartels were detected and fined, affecting $7.5 trillion in sales (OECD 2017b). 4. A recent report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2017) discusses this at length for the U.S. case. It finds that the net fis - cal impact of skilled immigrants is positive. Low- skilled immigrants entail a fis - cal cost, but that is offset later by fiscal contributions of the next- generation immigrants. 5. In relative terms, the estimated loss is larger in non- OECD economies (about 1.3 percent of GDP) than in OECD economies (about 1 percent of GDP). Since tax/ GDP ratios typically are much lower in non- OECD economies (emerging and de - veloping economies), the revenue loss relative to total tax revenue is particularly significant for them. 6. Most studies find only small effects of carbon taxes on competitiveness at the macroeconomic level and little evidence of emissions leakage from shift of pro - duction offshore to countries with laxer policies (see, for example, McKibbin and 256 productive equity others 2017). However, the competiveness effects can be more significant in par - tic u lar industries, notably energy intensive, trade- exposed industries.
