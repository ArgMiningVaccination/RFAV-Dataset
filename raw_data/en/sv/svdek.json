However, the term does not mean fire in the literal sense, in the way you might experience or sense it as candlelight or in an open fire. Pitta dosha, the heat energy in the body, is invisible. It manifests itself in your metabolism. When our food is broken down in the stomach and intestine, when enzymes are formed or hormones are released from the endocrine glands into the bloodstream - Pitta is always involved. This also means that everyone has Pitta bio-energy, which is primarily made up of the fire element. The water element also makes a (small) contribution. "}
