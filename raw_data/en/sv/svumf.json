AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a te mporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pur suant to Section 56-203, Idaho Code; also Public Law 602(b)(8), \"Afghan Allie s Act Bill, P.L. 110-234, Section 4105 Public hearing(s) concerni ng this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-fiv e (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than September 16, 2009. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: A reference to Public Law 111-8,\"Afghan Al lies Protection Act of 2009,\" is being added to this chapter to align it with recent changes in federal statute. The effect of this addition will be to extend Afghani immigrant benefits from six months to eight months. In addition, the following change s are being made to the chapter: 1. Reporting requirements for households th at have all elderly or disabled members are being simplified. This will make reporting easier for participants, improve program compliance, reduce errors, and save Department staff time. 2. The meals deduction for attendants of elderl y or disabled Food Stamp participants is no longer correct and is being updated. Ma king this correction will help elderly and disabled participants get the correct deduction counted against their income and help the Department avoid quality control errors. 3. The Department's new eligibility system makes provision for a 4th utility allowance category - the Telephone Utility Allowance (TUA). The TUA is being added to these rules since many households have phone services as their only utility expense. Currently, they receive no utility deduction, so adding the TUA will allow them to receive some credit for this type of expense.DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0304-0903 Rules Governing the Food Stamp Program in Idaho PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE Pa ge 61 2010 PENDING RULE BOOK4. The definition of the Farm Bill mentions the year 2002, but as the Farm Bill is reauthorized approximately every 5 years this is outdated; therefore, a more generic definition is being added to replace it. 5.

Also, other minor corrections and changes are being made to clarify existing text. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(b and c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate since some of the changes are being made to comply with deadlines in amendments to governing law or federal programs; some changes also confer benefits to food stamp participants. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is justified and necessary to avoid immediate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thous and dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year. There is no impact to the state general fund as a result of this rulemaking. Food stamp benefits are 100% federally-funded.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of a ny change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change: These rules were amended in response to the Governor's Executive Order No. 2008-05 that directed state agencies to hold back 4% of their state general fund budgets for State Fiscal Year 2009. This reduction was carried over for the Department's Division of Medicaid for State Fiscal Year 2010 under House Bill 322 (2009). Cost savings under these rule changes will be realized through reduction in reimbursement percentages to Medicaid providers of hospital services. Medicaid reimbursement for hospitals is base d on a percentage of customary charges. This rule change reduced the current maximum and minimum reimbursement percentages from 96.5% maximum and 81.5% minimum to new percentages of 91.7% maximum and 77.4% minimum. These percentages reflect a 5% decrease in the hospital reimbursement percentages, a reduction from the 10% decrease originally proposed. The pending rule is being adopted as proposed . The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the July 1, 2009, Idaho Admi nistrative Bulletin, Vol. 09-7, pages 54 through 57. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than te n thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: The projected fiscal impact is a total savings of $11,045,900; this includes state funds and federal matching funds. The projected savings to the state general fund is approximately $2,299,700.

DATED this 4th day of June, 2009. THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF THE PENDING RULE 405. INPATIENT HOSPITAL SERVICES - PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT. Under the Medicaid provisions of the Social Security Act, in reimbursing hospitals, the Department will pay the lesser of customary hospita l charges or the reasonable cost of inpatient services in accordance with the procedures deta iled under this Section of rule. The upper limits observed by the Department in reimbursing each i ndividual hospital must not exceed the payment that would be determined as a reasonable cost under the policies, definitions and procedures observed under Medicare (Title XVIII) principles of cost reimbursement. (3-30-07) 01. Exemption of New Hospitals . A hospital that has operated as the type of facility for which it is certified (or the equivalent ther eof) under present and previous ownership for less than three (3) full years will be paid in accordance with the Title XVIII principles of reasonable cost reimbursement, including those provisions app licable to new providers for the carryover and recovery of unreimbursed costs, in ac cordance with 42 CFR Section 413.64. (3-30-07) 02. Medicaid Inpatient Operating Cost Limits . The following describe the determination of inpatient operating cost limits. (3-30-07) a. Medicaid Cost Limits for Dates of Service Prior to a Current Year. The reimbursable reasonable costs for services rendere d prior to the beginning of the principal year, but included as prior period claims in a subsequent period's cost report, will be subject to the same operating cost limits as the claims under settlement. (3-30-07) b. Application of the Medicaid Cost Limit. In the determination of a hospital's reasonable costs for inpatient services rendered after the effective date of a principal year, a Hospital Inflation Index, computed for each hospita l's fiscal year end, will be applied to the operating costs, excluding capital costs and other al lowable costs as defined for the principal year and adjusted on a per diem basis for each subs equent year under the Hospital Inflation Index. (3-30-07)DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0309-0902 Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 122 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKi. Each inpatient routine service cost cent er, as reported in the finalized principal year end Medicare cost report, will be segregated in the Medicaid cost limit calculation and assigned a share of total Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs. The prorated ancillary costs will be determined by the ratio of each Medicaid routine cost center's reported costs to total Medicaid inpatient routine service costs in the principal year. (3-30-07) ii. Each routine cost center's total Medicai d routine service costs plus the assigned share of Medicaid inpatient ancillary costs of the principal year will be divided by the related Medicaid patient days to identify the total costs per diem in the principal year. (3-30-07) (1) The related inpatient routine service cost center's per diem capital and graduate medical education costs plus the prorated share of inpatient ancillary capital costs will be subtracted from the per diem amount identified in Subsection 405.02.b.ii. of this rule to identify each inpatient routine service cost center per diem cost limit in the principal year. (3-30-07) (2) If a provider did not have any Medica id inpatient utiliz ation or render any Medicaid inpatient services in an individual inpatien t routine service cost center in the fiscal year serving as the principal year, the principal y ear for only those routine cost centers without utilization in the provider's principal year will be appropriately calculated using the information available in the next subsequent year in which Medicaid utilization occurred. (3-30-07) iii. Each routine cost center's cost per diem for the principal year will be multiplied by the Hospital Inflation Index for ea ch subsequent fiscal year. (3-30-07) iv. The sum of the per diem cost limits for the Medicaid inpatient routine service cost centers of a hospital during the principal year, as adjusted by the Hospital Inflation Index, will be the Medicaid cost limit for operating costs in the current year. (3-30-07) (1) At the date of final settlement, reimbursement of the Medicaid current year inpatient routine cost centers plus the assigned anci llary costs will be limited to the total per diem operating costs as adjusted for each subsequent fi scal year after the principal year through the current year by the Hospital Inflation Cost Index. (3-30-07) (2) Providers will be notified of the estimat ed inflation index periodically or Hospital Inflation Index (CMS Market Basket Index) prior to fi nal settlement only upon written request. (3-30-07) 03. Adjustments to the Medicaid Cost Limit . A hospital's request for review by the Department concerning an adjustment to or ex emption from the cost limits imposed under the provisions set forth in Section 405 of this chapte r of rules, must be granted under the following circumstances: (3-30-07) a. Adjustments. Because of Extraordinary Circumstances. Where a provider's costs exceed the Medicaid limit due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the provider, the provider can request an adjustment to the co st limit to the extent the provider proves such higher costs result from the extraordinary circ umstances including, but not limited to, increased costs attributable to strikes, fires, earthqua ke, flood, or similar, unusual occurrences with substantial cost effects. (3-30-07)DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0309-0902 Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 123 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKb. Reimbursement to Public Hospitals. A Public Hospital that provides services free or at a nominal charge, which is less than, or e qual to fifty percent (50%) of its total allowable costs, will be reimbursed at the same rate that would be used if the hospital's charges were equal to, or greater than, its costs. (3-30-07) c. Adjustment to Cost Limits. A hospital is entitled to a reasonable increase in its Medicaid Cost limits if the hospital shows that its per diem costs of providing services have increased due to increases in case- mix, the adoption of new or changed services, the discontinuation of services or decrease in average length of stay for Medicaid inpatients since the principal year. Any hospital making such showing is entitled to an increa se commensurate with the increase in per diem costs. (3-30-07) i. The Medicaid operating cost limit may be adjusted by multiplying cost limit by the ratio of the current year's Case-Mix Index di vided by the principal ye ar's Case-Mix Index. (3-30-07) ii. The contested case procedure set fo r forth in IDAPA 16.05.03, \"Rules Governing Contested Case Proceedings and Declaratory Rulings ,\" is available to larger hospitals seeking such adjustments to their Medicaid Cost Limits. (3-30-07) d. Medicaid Operating and Cap ital and Medical Education Costs. All hospitals will be guaranteed at least eighty percent (80%) of their total allowable Medicaid Operating and Capital and medical education costs upon fina l settlement excluding DSH payments. (3-30-07) i. With the exception of Subsection 405.03.d.ii. of this rule, at the time of final settlement, the allowable Medicaid costs related to each hospital's fiscal year end will be according to the Reimbursement Floor Percentage. (3-30-07) ii. In the event that CMS informs the Department that total hospital payments under the Inpatient Operating Cost Limits exceed the inpatient Upper Payment Limit, the Department may reduce the guaranteed percentage defined as the Reimbursement Floor Percentage to hospitals. (3-30-07) e. Adjustment to the Proration of Ancillary Costs in the principal year. Where the provider asserts that the proration of ancillary co sts does not adequately reflect the total Medicaid cost per diem calculated for the inpatient routin e service cost centers in the principal year, the provider may submit a detailed analysis of ancillary services provided to each participant for each type of patient day during each participant's stay during the principal ye ar. The provider will be granted this adjustment only once upon appeal for the first cost reporting year that the limits are in effect. (3-30-07) 04. Payment Procedures . The following procedures are applicable to in-patient hospitals: (3-30-07) a. The participant's admission and length of stay is subject to preadmission, concurrent and retrospective review by a Qual ity Improvement Organization (QIO) designated by the Department. QIO review will be governed by provisions of the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0309-0902 Medicaid Basic Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 124 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKManual as amended. If such review identifies that an admission or continued stay is not medically necessary, then no Medicaid payment will be made . Failure to obtain a timely QIO review as required by Section 405 of this chapter of rules, and as outlined in the QIO Idaho Medicaid Provider Manual as amended, will result in the QIO conducting a late review. After a QIO review has determined that the hospital stay was medically necessary, Medicaid will assess a late review penalty to the hospital as outlined in Subsection 405.05 of this rule. (3-30-07) i. All admissions are subject to QIO review to determine if continued stay in inpatient status is medically necessary.

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Preventive Health Assistance (PHA) benefit currently has a cap on how many points a child can earn when the child participates in both the Behavioral PHA and Wellness PHA at the same time. This cap is less than the cap for a child who does not participate in both types of PHA concurrently. The Department is removing the more restrictive cap to allow a participant to earn the maximum number of points for both PHA types. Other changes are being made to align pharmacy provider qualif ications, remove references to sporting and fitness programs, remove references to vou chers, require prior authorization for PHA services and products, and to restrict use of Wellness PHA points earned to offsetting premiums. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None.

DATED this 4th day of June, 2009. THE FOLLOWING IS THE TEXT OF THE PENDING RULE 257. NURSING FACILITY - DEVELOPMENT OF THE RATE. Nursing facility rates are prospective, with new rates effective July 1st of each year, and are recalculated annually with quarterly adjustments fo r case mix. The rate for a nursing facility is the sum of the cost components described in Subsec tion 257.04 through 257.09 of this rule. In no case will the rate be set higher than the charge for like services to private pay patients in effect for the period for which payment is made as computed by the lower of costs or customary charges. (5-8-09) 01. Applicable Case Mix Index (CMI) . The Medicaid CMI used in establishing each facility's rate is calculated based on the most re cent assessment for each Medicaid resident in the nursing facility on the first day of the month of th e preceding quarter (for example, assessments as of April 1are used to establish the CMI needed to establish rates for the quarter beginning July 1st). Facility-wide CMI is calculated based on the most recent assessment for all residents in the nursing facility. The CMI is recalculated quarterly and each nursing facility's rate is adjusted accordingly. A facility-wide CMI is also established each year by averaging four (4) calendar quarter CMIs for the cost reporting period from histor ical data to represent each fiscal quarter in the cost reporting period (for example, an Octobe r 1 CMI would represent the fiscal quarter ended September 30th). (3-19-07) 02. Applicable Cost Data . The cost data used in establishing the cost components of the rate calculation are from the audited or unaudi ted cost report which ended during the previous calendar year (for example, cost reports ending during the period from January 1, 1998 - December 31, 1998 are used in setting rates effectiv e July 1, 1999). The draft audit of a cost report submitted by a facility will be issued by the Department no later than five (5) months after the date all information required for completion of the audit is filed with the Department. (3-19-07)DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-0903 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 156 2010 PENDING RULE BOOK03. Interim Rates . Nursing facilities with unaudited cost reports are given an interim rate established by the Department until a rate is calculated based on an audited cost report. When audited data are available, a retroactive adjus tment to the payment rate is made through the calculation of the finalized rate. (3-19-07) 04. Direct Care Cost Component . The direct care cost component of a nursing facility's rate is determined as follows: (3-19-07) a. The direct care per diem cost limit applicable to the rate period for a nursing facility type (free- standing and urban hospital-based nursing f acility or rural hospital-based nursing facility) is identified. The identified direct care cost limit is divided by the statewide average CMI for the cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the nursing facility's facility- wide CMI for the cost reporting period to derive the adjusted direct care per diem cost limit. (3-19-07) b. The adjusted direct care per diem cost limit is compared to the nursing facility's inflated direct care per diem co sts. The lower of the two (2) amounts is then case mix adjusted. (3-19-07) i. If the adjusted direct care per diem cost limit is lower, the adjusted limit is divided by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for th e cost reporting period, and then multiplied by the nursing facility's most recent quarterly Medicaid CMI for the rate period to arrive at the direct care cost component. (3-19-07) ii. If the inflated direct care per diem costs are lower, these costs, minus raw food and Medicaid related ancillary costs, are divided by the nursing facility's facility-wide CMI for the cost reporting period, then multiplied by the nursi ng facility's most recen t quarterly Medicaid CMI for the rate period. Raw food and Medicaid related ancillary costs are then added back to arrive at the direct care cost component. (3-19-07) 05. Indirect Care Cost Component . The indirect care cost component of a facility's rate is the lesser of the facility's inflated indirect care per diem costs, or the indirect per diem cost limit for that type of provider -- free-standing a nd urban hospital-based nursing facilities, or rural hospital-based nursing facilities. (3-19-07) 06. Efficiency Incentive . The efficiency incentive is av ailable to those providers, both free-standing and hospital-based, which have inflated per diem indirect care costs less than the indirect per diem cost limit for that type of provider. The efficiency incentive is calculated by multiplying the difference between the per diem i ndirect cost limit and the facility's inflated per diem indirect care costs by seventy fifty percent ( 750%) not to exceed nine dollars and fifty cents ($9.50) per patient day . There is no incentive available to t hose facilities with per diem costs in excess of the indirect care cost limit, or to any facility based on the direct care cost component. (3-19-07) ( ) 07. Costs Exempt From Limitation . Costs exempt from cost limits are property taxes, property insurance, utilities and costs related to new legal mandates as defined in Section 264 of these rules. (3-19-07)DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-0903 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 157 2010 PENDING RULE BOOK08. Property Reimbursement . The property reimbursement component is calculated in accordance with Section 275 and Subsection 240.19 of these rules. (3-19-07) 09. Revenue Offset . Revenues from products or serv ices provided to nonpatients will be offset from the corresponding rate component(s ) as described in Section 257 of these rules. (3-19-07) 258. NURSING FACILITY - COST LIMI TS BASED ON COST REPORT. Each July 1st cost limitations will be established for nursing facilities based on the most recent audited cost report with an end date of June 30th of the previ ous year or before. Calculated limitations will be effective for a one (1) year pe riod, from July 1 through June 30th of each year, which is the rate year. (5-8-09) 01. Percentage Above Bed-Weighted Median . Prior to establishing the first \"shadow rates\" at July 1, 1999, the estimated Medicaid paym ents under the previous retrospective system for the year period from July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, will be calculated. This amount will then be used to model the estimated payments unde r the case mix system set forth in Sections 255 through 257 of these rules. The percentages above the bed-weighted median, for direct and indirect costs, will be establis hed at a level that approximate s the same amount of Medicaid expenditures as would have been produced by the re trospective system. The percentages will also be established to appr oximate the same distribution of total Medicaid dollars between the hospital-based and freestanding nursi ng facilities as existed under th e retrospective system. Once the percentage is established, it will be used to calculate the limit by multiplying the bed-weighted median per diem direct cost times the calculated percentage for that class of provider. There will be a direct and indirect percentage that is app lied to freestanding and urban hospital-based nursing facilities, and a higher direct and indirect percentage that is applied to rural hospital-based nursing facilities. Once established, these percentages will remain in effect for future rate setting periods. (3-19-07) 02. Direct Cost Limits . The direct cost limitation will be calculated by indexing the selected cost data forward by the inflation adju stment from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the period for which the limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be normalized and arrayed from high to low, with freestanding and hospital-based nursing facilities included in the same array, and the bed-weighted median will be computed. (3-19-07) 03. Indirect Cost Limits . The indirect cost limitation will be calculated by indexing the selected cost data forward by the inflation adjustment from the midpoint of the cost report period to the midpoint of the period for which th e limit will be applicable. The indexed per diem costs will then be arrayed, with freestanding a nd hospital- based nursing facilities included in the same array, and the bed-weighted median will be computed. (3-19-07) 04. Limitation on Increase or Decrease of Cost Limits . Increases in the direct and indirect cost limits will be determined by the limitations calculated in the most recent base year, indexed forward each year from the midpoint of th e base year to the midpoint of the rate year by the inflation factor plus two one percent ( 21%) per annum. The calculated direct and indirect cost limits will not be allowed to decrease below the limitations effective in the base year.

(5-8-09) ( ) 05. Costs Exempt From Limitations . Costs exempt from limitations include property taxes, property insurance, and utilities. These co sts will be reimbursed on a per diem basis and will not be included in the calcul ation of the direct or indirect care component. However, property taxes and property insurance will be subject to minimum occupancy levels as defined in Section 278 of these rules.

BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIOR AUTHORIZATION - PROVIDER REIMBURSEMENT.Providers are reimbursed on a fee for service basis based on a participant budget. (3-19-07) 01. Methodology for Developing Participant Budget Prior to October 1, 2006 . The participant budget is developed usi ng the following methodology: (3-19-07) a. Evaluate the past three (3) years of Medi caid expenditures from the participant's profile, excluding physician, pharmacy, and institutional services; (3-19-07) b. Review all assessment information id entified in Section 512 of these rules; (3-19-07) c. Identify the level of support derived from the most current SIB-R. The level of support is a combination of the individual's f unctional abilities and maladaptive behavior as determined by the SIB-R. Six (6) br oad levels of support have been identified on a scale from zero to one hundred (0 - 100) (see Table 514.01.c.). There are six (6) levels of support, each corresponding to a support score range. (3-19-07) d. Correlate the level of support identified by the SIB-R to a budget range derived TABLE 514.01.c. - LEVEL OF SUPPORT Support Score Range Level of Support 1-24 Pervasive 25-39 Extensive 40-54 Frequent55-69 Limited 70-84 Intermittent 85-100 Infrequent DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-0906 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 186 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKfrom the expenditures of individuals at the same level of support across the adult DD population. This correlation will occur annually prior to the development to the plan of service; (3-19-07) 02. Negotiating an Appropriate Participant Budget Prior to October 1, 2006 . The assessor, the participant, and th e plan developer must use all th e information from Subsections 514.01.a. through 514.01.d. of these rules to negotiate an appropriate budget that will support the participant's identified needs. (3-19-07) 03. Individualized Budget Beginning on October 1, 2006 . Beginning October 1, 2006, for DD and ISSH waiver participants, and beginning January 1, 2007, for all other adult DD participants, the Department sets an individua lized budget for each participant according to an individualized measurement of the participant' s functional abilities, behavioral limitations, medical needs, and other individual factors related to the participant's disability. Using these specific participant factors, the budget-setti ng methodology will correlate a participant's characteristics with the participant's individua lized budget amount, so participants with higher needs will be assigned a higher individualized budget amount. (3-19-07) ( ) a. During the implementation phase of usi ng the new individualized budget-setting methodology, the budget calculation will include revi ewing the participant's previous year's budget. When the calculated budget is less than five percent (5%) above or below the previous year's budget, the participant' s set budget amount is the calculated budget amount. When the calculated budget is greater than five percent (5 %) above or below the previous year's budget, the participant's set budget amount is the previous year's budget amount. The Department will collect information on discrepanc ies between the calculated budget and the previous year's budget as part of the ongoing assessment and improvement process of the budget-setting methodology. (3-19-07) b. The Department notifies each partic ipant of his set budget amount. The notification will include how the participant may request reconsideration of the set budget amount. (3-19-07) c. Individualized budgets will be re-evaluated annually. At the request of the participant, the Department will also re -evaluate the set budget amount when there are documented changes in the partic ipant's individualized needs and it is demonstrated that these additional needs cannot be suppor ted by the current budget. (3-19-07) 04. Residential Habilitation - Supported Li ving Acuity-Based Levels of Support . Reimbursement for residential habilitation - supporte d living is based on the participant's assessed level of support need. All plans of service that include supported living must include community integration goals that provide for maintained or enhanced independence, quality of life, and self- determination. As a participant's independence increases and he is less dependent on supports, he must transition to less intense supports. (3-19-07) a. High support is for those participants w ho require twenty-four (24) hour per day supports and supervision and have an SIB-R Support Level of Pervasive, Extensive, or Frequent. High support allows for a blend of one-to-one and group staffing. Participants authorized at the high support daily rate will not be authorized to receive developmental therapy services, adult day care, or non-medical transportation. These servic es are included in the high support daily rate.DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0310-0906 Medicaid Enhanced Plan Benefits PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 187 2010 PENDING RULE BOOK(3-19-07) b. Intense support is for those exceptional participants who require intense, twenty- four (24) hour per day supports and supervision. This support leve l typically requires one-on-one staffing, but requests for a blend of one-on-one and group staffing will be reviewed on a case-by- case basis. Participants authorized at the inte nse support daily rate will not be authorized to receive developmental therapy services, adult day care, or non-medical transportation. These services are included in the intense support da ily rate. To qualify for this level of support, participants must be evaluated to meet one or more of the following criteria: (3-19-07) i. Recent felony convictions or charges for of fenses related to the serious injury or harm of another person. These participants must have been placed in a supported living setting directly from incarceration or directly afte r being diverted from incarceration. (3-19-07) ii. History of predatory sexual offenses a nd are at high risk to re-offend based on a sexual offender risk assessm ent completed by an appropr iate professional. (3-19-07) iii. Documented, sustained history of serious aggressive behavior showing a pattern of causing harm to themselves or others. The serious aggressive behavior must be such that the threat or use of force on another person makes that person reasonably fear bodily harm. The participant must also have the capability to carry out such a threat. The frequency and intensity of this type of aggressive behavior must requi re continuous monitoring to prevent injury to themselves or others. (3-19-07) iv. Chronic or acute medical conditions that are so complex or unstable that one-to- one staffing is required to provide frequent inte rventions and constant monitoring. Without this intervention and monitoring the participant would require placement in a nursing facility, hospital, or ICF/MR with twenty-four (24) hour on-site nursing. Verification of the complex medical condition and the need for this level of se rvice requires medical documentation. (3-19-07) c. Hourly support is for those individuals that do not meet criteria for either high or intense supports or those individuals who qualify for a daily rate but whose needs can be met with less than twenty-four (24) per day support. The combination of hourly supported living, developmental therapy, community supported em ployment, and adult day care will not be authorized to exceed the maximum set daily amount established by the Department except when all of the following conditions are met: (3-19-07) i. The participant is eligible to receive the high support daily rate; (3-19-07)ii. Community supported employment is included in the plan and is causing the combination to exceed the daily limit; (3-19-07) iii. There is documentation that the Person- Centered Planning team has explored other options including using lower cost services and natural supports; and (3-19-07) iv. The participant's health and safety need s will be met using hourly services despite having been assessed to qualify for twenty-four (24) hour care.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a te mporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Sect ions 56-202 and 56-203, Idaho Code; the Community Services Block Grant Act, 42 US C 9901, et seq.; and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Public Law 111-5, Title VIII (3). PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerni ng this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-fiv e (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than Wednesday, October 21, 2009. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) is a federal grant that is administered by the Department; its funds are managed under contracts with local Community Action Agencies. Block grant funds are used for the redu ction of poverty, the revitalization of low- income communities, and the empowerment of lo w-income families and individuals in rural and urban areas to become fully self-sufficient. Since federal statute allows states to set some of the parameters of income eligibility for the CSBG Program, the Department is changing the rule to exclude child support income from being counted when determining program eligibility. This change will align CSBG Program income eligibility with that of si milar programs (e.g., the U.S. Department of Energy's Weatherization Assist ance Program) since many of the same families who are eligible for the Weatherization Program wo uld benefit from programs offered under the Community Services Block Grant. This alignment of income eligibility criteria reduces administrative overhead, reduces error, and better serves those most in need in our communities. This rulemaking also increases the income limit for CSBG Program eligibility from 125% to 200% of the federal poverty guidelines , as provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). This increase in the income limit will allow the program to reach many more Idaho families wi th help urgently needed in this recession. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of the rule is appropriate since it confers a DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0410-0902 Community Services Block Grant Program PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 264 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKbenefit. FEE SUMMARY: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(2), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that the fee or charge being imposed or increased is just ified and necessary to a void immediate danger and the fee is described herein: N/A FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thous and dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: There is no anticipated fiscal impact to the state general fund related to the rulemaking. Community Services Block Grant (CSBG) Program monies are 100% federal. The increase in eligibility to 200% of the Federal Poverty Guideline will allow the Department to fully obligate and spend the Community Services Block Grant economic stimulus award made available under the Am erican Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). The spending authority for this aw ard was provided to the Department by the 2009 Legislature. Excluding child support income in eligibility determination would increase the number of eligible families by approximately 23% to the equivalent of 170% of Federal Poverty Limits. This change would not have an effe ct on the program bu t would make all the programs have the same child support income guidelines. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67- 5220, Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted because the rule ch anges are being made to implement provisions of the ARRA.

The pending rule becomes final and effective at the conclusion of the legislative session, unl ess the rule is approved, rejected, amended, or modified by concurrent resolution in accordance with Section 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. If the pending rule is approved, amended, or modifi ed by concurrent resolution, the rule becomes final and effective upon adoption of the concurrent resolution or upon the date specified in the concurrent resolution. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Section 67-5224, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a pending rule. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 56-202, Idaho Code, and 42 U.S.C. Sections 8621 to 8629, also known as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a concise explanatory statement of the reasons for adopting the pending rule and a statement of a ny change between the text of the proposed rule and the text of the pending rule with an explanation of the reasons for the change. This rule changed the income eligibility for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to 60% of Idaho's State Median Income and excludes child support income as countable income which aligns the LIHEAP program with the Community Services Block Grant Program and the U.S. Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program. The pending rule is being adopted as proposed . The complete text of the proposed rule was published in the October 7, 2009, Idaho Admi nistrative Bulletin, Vol. 09-10, pages 457 through 459. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than te n thousand dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: This rulemaking increases the LIHEAP eligibility income limits to 60% of the 2009 Idaho State Median Income and adds child suppor t income to the list of income not counted. This will result in approximately 6,460 more families being eligible for LIHEAP, an increase of approximately 20%. Last year, approximately 45,000 families received LIHEAP benefits, with the average benefit for each family be ing $386 annually. To accommodate the increased number of eligible families, the benefit amount for each case will be decreased by approximately $50, to about $336 annually. The LIHEAP program is 100% federally-funded and does not spen d any state general funds.

AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5221(1) and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that this agency has adopted a te mporary rule, and proposed rulemaking procedures have been initiated. The action is authorized pursuant to Section 56-202, Idaho Code, and 42 U.S.C. Sections 8621 to 8629, also known as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: Public hearing(s) concerni ng this rulemaking will be scheduled if requested in writing by twenty-fiv e (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency, not later than October 21, 2009. The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made not later than five (5) days prior to the hearing, to the agency address below. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is the required finding and concise statement of its supporting reasons for adopting a temporary rule and a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: Last year federal statute mandated that states use 160% of the 2009 Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) income eligibility determination. States were also ma ndated to return to 150% of FPG for federal fiscal year 2010 or to use 60% of the federally-established Idaho State Median Income. This rule change will use 60% of State Median Income. This rule change will also exclude child support income as countable income. This aligns the LIHEAP program with the Community Se rvices Block Grant Program and the U.S. Department of Energy's Weatherization Assistance Program. Many of the same families who apply and are eligible for the LIHEAP program would benefit from the programs offered by the Community Services Block Grant program and Weatherization. Aligning DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0414-0901 Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 286 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKincome eligibility criteria across these program s reduces administrative overhead, reduces error, and better serves those mo st in need in our communities. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Section 67-5226(1)(c), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporar y adoption of the rule is appr opriate for the following reasons: With the increased funds for this program, more low-income families will benefit from this safety net by creating more economic stability through subsidizing their home heating costs. FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thous and dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: This rulemaking increases the LIHEAP eligibility income limits to 60% of the 2009 Idaho State Median Income and adds child suppor t income to the list of income not counted. This will result in approximately 6,460 more families being eligible for LIHEAP, an increase of approximately 20%. Last year, approximately 45,000 families received LIHEAP benefits, with the average benefit for each family be ing $386 annually. To accommodate the increased number of eligible families, the benefit amount for each case will be decreased by approximately $50, to about $336 annually. The LIHEAP program is 100% federally-funded and does not spen d any state general funds. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Pursuant to Section 67- 5220, Idaho Code, negotiated rulemaking was not conducted becaus e these rules confer a benefit.

The action is authorized pursuant to 110-351, Section 402 (1)(B) re: changes related to international adoptions affecting Part E of Title IV of the Social Security Act, Section 473 (Adoption and Guardianship Program) (42 USC 673).

DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The following is a nontechnical explanation of the substance and purpose of the proposed rulemaking: The service of \"professional foster care\" is being renamed and its rules replaced with \"treatment foster care\" rules that align with the treatment foster care rules under IDAPA 16.07.37, \"Children's Mental Health Services.\" Alignment between these two chapters will help eliminate confusion for foster parents providing treatment foster care who may be participating in either Child and Family Serv ices or Children's Mental Health programs. In addition, new rules are being proposed to clarify and resolve reimbursement issues related to contract payments to foster pare nts for additional services beyond regular or specialized foster care. This will be accomplished by setting out in rule the expectations for service and how payments will be structured. These new rules will increase accountability for treatment foster parents and improve services to children and youth in foster care who need a higher level of care due to behavioral and other mental health issues. The outcome of these new rules will be to increase the stability of foster care placements for children and youth who are hard to place and hard to mainta in in foster care, and will better address their treatment needs. Finally, changes are being made to update the adoption rules to increase regional efficiencies and to align rules with changes to federal law made under Public Law 110-351. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: NA FISCAL IMPACT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thous and dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year.

Children applying for adoption assistance benefits must meet Id aho's definition of a child with special needs according to Section 473 (c) of P.L. 96-272 (The Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980). There are five (5) ways a child can be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance: (5-8-09) a.

For children whose adoption assistance eligibility is based on the child's AF DC eligibility, the child must meet the AFDC criteria at the time of removal from his home. (5-8-09) i. If the child is removed from his home in accordance with the first judicial determination, such determin ation must indicate that it was contrary to the welfare of the child to remain in the home. (5-8-09) ii. If the child is removed from the home in accordance with a voluntary out-of-home placement agreement, the child must receive at least one (1) Title IV-E foster care payment to be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance. (5-8-09) b. Child is eligible for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and meets the definition of a child with special needs. (5-3-03) i. A child is eligible for adoption assistan ce if, at the time the adoption petition is filed, the child has met the requirements for Title XVI (SSI) benefits; (5-3-03) ii. The circumstances of a child's removal from his home or whether the public child welfare agency has responsibility for the child' s placement and care is not relevant. (5-3-03) c. Child has been voluntarily relinquished to a private non-profit adoption agency and meets the definition of a child with special needs. (5-3-03) i. The child must meet the requirements, or would have met the requirements, of the AFDC program as such sections were in effect on July 16, 1996, in or for the month in which the relinquishment occurred, or court proceedings were held which lead to the removal of the child from his home; (5-3-03) ii. At the time of the voluntary relinquishment, the court must make a judicial determination that it would be contrary to the welfare of the child for the child to remain in the home. (5-8-09) d. Child is eligible for Title IV-E adoption a ssistance as a child of a minor parent and at the time of the adoption petition the child meets the definition of a child with special needs. (5-3-03) i.

The child continues to reside in the foster home with his minor parent until the adoption petition has been filed. If the child and mi nor parent have been separated in foster care prior to the time of the adoption petition, the child' s eligibility for Title IV-E adoption assistance must be determined based on the child's current and individual circumstances. (5-3-03) e. Child is eligible due to prior Title IV-E adoption assistance eligibility and meets DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0601-0901 Child and Family Services PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 305 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKthe definition of a child with special needs. (5-3-03) i. A child whose adoption later dissolves or the adoptive parent(s) die, may continue to be eligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance in a subsequent adoption. (5-3-03) ii. The subsequent adoption of a child may be arranged through an independent adoption, private agency, or state agency. (5-3-03) iii. No needs or eligibility redetermination is to be made upon a subsequent adoption. The child's need and eligibility remain unchang ed from what they were prior to the initial adoption. (5-3-03) iv. It is the responsibility of the placing state to determine whether the child meets the definition of special needs and to pay the subsidy in a subsequent adoption. (5-3-03) 02. Special Needs Criteria . The definition of special needs includes the following factors: (3-30-07) a. The child cannot or should not be returned to the home of the parents as evidenced by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating parents rights or an Abandonment Certificate or its equivalent issued by a governmental entity either domestic or foreign ; and (5-8-09) ( ) b. The child has a physical, mental, emotional, or medical disability, or is at risk of developing such disability based on known informa tion regarding the birth family and child's history, or (3-18-99) c. The child's age makes it difficult to find an adoptive home; or (3-18-99) d. The child is a member of a sibling group that must not be placed apart; and (5-3-03) e. State must make a reasonable but unsuccessful effort to place the child with special needs without a subsidy, except in cases where it is not in the best interests of the child due to his significant emotional ties with the foster parent(s ) or relative(s) who are willing to adopt the child. (5-3-03) 03. Determination of Eligibility for State Funded Adoption Assistance . Children in state custody who meet the special needs criteria found in Subsection 900.02 of these rules and do not meet any of the criteria for Title IV-E adoption assistance found at Subsection 900.01 in these rules, may be eligible for state-funded adoption assistance benefits. If the child is determined ineligible for Title IV-E adoption assistance, the application will be eval uated for a state-funded subsidy. (3-30-07) 04. Interjurisdictional Adoptions . When a child's adoption is arranged through the care and placement of a private non-profit adop tion agency in another state and the adoptive family are residents of Idaho, the state of Idaho is responsible for the eligibility determination, negotiation, and payment of any subsequent Title IV-E adoptio n assistance benefits. (3-30-07)DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0601-0901 Child and Family Services PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 306 2010 PENDING RULE BOOK05.

This restriction does not prohibit adoption assistance pa yments for a child described in this Subsection who is placed in foster care subsequent to the failure, as determined by the State, of the initial adoption of the child by the adoptive parents. ( ) (BREAK IN CONTINUITY OF SECTIONS) 910. TYPES AND AMOUNTS OF ASSISTANCE. The needs of the child and the family, including any other children in the family, will be considered in determining the amount and type of support to be provided. Assistance may include the following: (3-30-07) 01. Nonrecurring Adoption Reimbursement . Payment for certain one (1) time expenses necessary to finalize the adoption may be paid when a family adopts a special needs child. The child's eligibility must be determined and the contract for reimbursement must be fully executed prior to the finalization of the adop tion. The reimbursement is paid only after the adoption finalizes. The expenses are defined as reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees and other expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption finalization of a child with special needs and which are not incurred in violation of state or federal law. They may include mileage and lodging involved in visi ting the child before placement occurs. These expenses cannot be reimbursed if they are paid for the adoptive parents by other sources such as an employer. Documentation of expenses must be submitted. Costs are reimbursable up to two thousand dollars ($2,000) per child and are en tered on the Adoption Assistance Program Agreement. Families applying for Nonrecurring Adoption Reimbursement separate from the regular Adoption Assistance program must submit an application for Nonrecurring Adoption Expenses Reimbursement, obtain a determinati on of eligibility, and negotiate a Nonrecurring Adoption Expenses Reimbursement Agreement prior to the finalization of the child's adoption. Families applying for Nonrecurring Adoption Expe nses Reimbursement on behalf of a child who is adopted through an international adoption must submit an application for Nonrecurring Adoption Expenses Reimbursement, obtain a de termination of eligibility, and negotiate a Nonrecurring Adoption Expenses Reimbursement Agreement prior to the family's departure to the foreign country and the child's adoption in the foreign country. Children for whom the adoption has been finalized without a negotiated Nonrec urring Expenses Reimbursement Agreement are not eligible to apply for these benefits. (5-3-03) ( ) 02. Monthly Cash Payment . Financial assistance in the form of a monthly cash payment may be established to assist the adoptiv e family in meeting the additional expenses of the child's special needs. The amount of the pa yment must be negotiated with the family by the adoption worker and based on the family's circ umstances and what additional resources are needed to incorporate the child into the adoptive family. The amount must not exceed the rate for family foster care which would be made if the child were in a family foster home in Idaho. For DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WELFARE Docket No. 16-0601-0901 Child and Family Services PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 307 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKchildren who meet the definition of special need s at Subsection 900.02 of these rules, no monthly cash payment is allowable until such time as the specific disability for which the child is known to be at risk becomes evident. For children who ar e currently eligible for Personal Care Services (PCS), the professional foster care rate may be used in negotiating the adoption assistance upon prior approval of the Department's Family and Community Services (FACS) Division Administrator. Benefits will continue until th e child reaches eighteen (18) years, based upon an annual determination of continuing need. (3-30-07) 03. Title XIX -- Medicaid Coverage . Any child with special needs who has an adoption assistance agreement in effect is also eligible for medical coverage. A Title IV-E adoption assistance agreement provides Medicaid c overage in the state of Idaho and in all other states. Under a state-funded adoption assistance agre ement, a child living in Idaho is eligible for Medicaid. If the family moves to another state, Medicaid may or may not be available. If Medicaid is not available in the new state, provi sions for medical coverage must be contained in the adoption assistance agreement or in an amendm ent to the agreement. Families enrolled in a group health plan who plan to request to use Medi caid as the child's primary health care coverage must apply to the Idaho Health Insurance Prem ium Payment (HIPP) program at the time of benefit negotiation. Medicaid provides secondary cove rage after the family's health insurance has reached its benefit limit. All services reimbursed by Medicaid must be determined to be medically necessary. Prior authorization may be require d for some Medicaid reimbursable services. Medicaid benefits are available until the child reaches the age of eighteen (18), based upon an annual determination of continuing need. (3-30-07) 04. Title XX -- Social Services .

The pending rule will become final and effective immediately upon the conclusion of the Second Regular Session of the Sixtieth Idaho Legislature unless prior to that date the rule is rejected in whole or in part by concurrent resolution in accordance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5291, Idaho Code. AUTHORITY: In compliance with Sections 67-5224 and 67-5226, Idaho Code, notice is hereby given that the Board has adopted a temporary and pending rule. This action is authorized by Sections 39-105 and 39-107, Idaho Code. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: A detailed summary of the reason for adopting this rule is set forth in the initial proposal published in th e Idaho Administrative Bulletin, November 5, 2008, Vol. 08-11, pages 94 through 114. After consideration of public comments, the rule has been adopted as initially proposed. The Rule making and Public Comment Summary can be obtained at http://www.deq.idaho.gov/ru les/air/58_0101_0702_temporary_pending.cfm or by contacting the undersigned. TEMPORARY RULE JUSTIFICATION: Pursuant to Sections 67-5226(1)(a), Idaho Code, the Governor has found that temporary adoption of this rule is necessary to protect the public health. DEQ has received approval fr om the Governor's office for temporary adoption of this rule in an effort to reduce volatile organic compound emissions and potentially avoid an ozone nonattainment designation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The sooner the vapor collection system s are installed, the greater chance the area has to avoid nonattainment designation. It is pa rticularly important to have a rule effective by spring 2009 so that the regulated community w ill have time to install the necessary vapor collection equipment before the hot summer weather sets in, which is when ozone is formed. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: These rules do not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government nor are they more stringent than federal regulations. The Clean Air Act requires, in moderate ozone nona ttainment areas, the use of gasoline vapor collection for facilities that sell more than 10,000 gallons of gasoline per month. These rules are broader in scope than the federal law as they apply to sources in an area not yet designated nonattainment. Additionally, the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) requires the use of gasoline vapor collection for gasoline dispensing facilities with throughput of 100,000 gallons or more of gasoline per month. 40 CFR Part 63, Subpart CCCCCC (40 CFR 63.11118). These rules require gasoline va por collection for gasoline storage tanks with a capacity of 10,000 gallons or more; thus, they a pply to a broader class of gasoline dispensing facilities than the NESHAPs. These rules constitute an important preemptive step for the Treasure Valley to take to attempt DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0101-0702 Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 418 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKto avoid an ozone nonattainment designation. The oz one national ambient air quality standard is a standard designed to protect human health and the environment. It is clear under federal law that scientists have determined that vapor collection is an important control measure to implement for ozone reduction. FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousa nd dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: Not applicable.

Hilton, Boise, IdahoDEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0101-0702 Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 419 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKDESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The Treasure Valley is now, and has been for several years, experiencing high concentrations of ozone in the ambient air. The federal government lowered the national ambient air quality sta ndard for ozone this year. Installation and operation of Stage 1 vapor collection equipment will reduce volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by over 1,000 tons per year. Because VOCs are the major contributor to ozone formation, such a reduction should redu ce ozone in the ambien t air and potentially lower concentrations such that ozone nonattainment may be avoided. Additionally, the Treasure Valley Air Qualit y Plan, as developed by the Treasure Valley Air Quality Council and accepted by the Idah o Legislature, requires the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to develop a rule requiring Stage 1 vapor collection in Ada and Canyon Counties. Treasure Valley Air Quality Plan, February 27, 2007 at page 95. DEQ has received approval from the Governor's office for temporar y adoption of this rule in an effort to reduce VOC emissions and potentially avoid an ozone nonattainment designation by the U.S. Environmental Protec tion Agency. The sooner the vapor collection systems are installed, the grea ter chance the area has to avoid nonattainment designation. It is particularly important to have a rule ef fective by spring 2009 so that the regulated community will have time to install the necessary vapor collection equipment before the hot summer weather sets in, which is when ozone is formed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality at the February 2009 Board meeting for adoption as a pending and temporary rule. If adopted by th e Board, the temporar y rule will become effective on April 1, 2009. The pending rule is ex pected to be final upon adjournment of the 2010 legislative session if approved by the Legislature. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during negotiations conducted pursuant to Section 67-5220, Idaho Code and IDAPA 04.11.01.810-815. On September 5, 2007, the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Id aho Administrative Bulletin, Vol. 07-9, page 309. On August 1, 2008, a preliminary draft rule was made available for public review. Meetings were held on September 27, 2007; October 18, 2007; December 6, 2007; February 6, 2008; August 13, 2008; and August 26, 2008. Sev eral members of the public participated in this negotiated rulemaking process by attending the meetings and by submitting written comments. IDAHO CODE SECTION 39-107D STATEMENT: The proposed rules do not regulate an activity not regulated by the federal government nor are they more stringent than federal regulations. The Clean Air Act requires, in moderate ozone nonattainment areas, the use of gasoline vapor collection for fac ilities that sell more than 10,000 ga llons of gasoline per month. The proposed rules are broader in scope than the fe deral law as they apply to sources in an area not yet designated nonattainment.

Th is action is authorized by Sections 39-105 and 39-107, Idaho Code. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: A public hearing concerning this proposed rulemaking will be held as follows: The hearing site(s) will be accessible to persons with disabilities. Requests for accommodation must be made no later than five (5 ) days prior to the hearing. For arrangements, contact the undersigned at (208) 373-0418. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: The Rules for the Control of Air Pollution in Idaho limit, for fuel burning sources, the amount of sulfur allowe d in residual fuel oil, distillate fuel oil, and coal. This limits the flexibility of industries to use less expensive alternative fuels with higher sulfur contents. DEQ has initiated this rulemaking to allow industries a less expensive alternative to current fuels with no additional environmental impact. The revisions included in this proposed rule allow for higher sulfur content fuels to be used in fuel burning equipment in Idaho as long as the resulting em issions are at levels equal to or lower than those provided for in the existing rules. Members of the regulated community who may be subject to Idaho's air quality rules, as well as special interest groups, public offici als, or members of th e public who have an interest in the regulation of air emissions from sources in Idaho, may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. It is this addition to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality at the Oc tober 2009 Board meeting for adoption as a pending rule. The rule is expected to be fina l and effective upon the adjournment of the 2010 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: The text of the proposed rule has been drafted based on discussions held and concerns raised during negotiations conducted pursuant to Idaho Code Section 67-5220 and IDAPA 58.01.23.810-815. On April 1, 2009, the Notice of Negotiated Rulemaking was published in the Idaho Admini strative Bulletin, Vol. 09-4, page 40.

The action is authorized by Chapters 44 and 58, Title 39, Idaho Code. In addition, 40 CFR 271.21( e) and Section 39-4404, Idaho Code, require DEQ to adopt amendments to federal law as proposed under this docket. PUBLIC HEARING SCHEDULE: No hearings have been sche duled. Pursuant to Section 67- 5222(2), Idaho Code, a public hear ing will be held if requested in writing by twenty-five (25) persons, a political subdivision, or an agency. Written requests for a hearing must be receiv ed by the undersigned on or before August 19, 2009. If no such written request is received, a public hearing will not be held. DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY: Idaho's Rules an d Standards for Hazardous Waste are updated annually to maintain consistency with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's federal regulations implementing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as directed by the Idaho Hazardous Waste Man agement Act (HWMA). Id aho has historically adopted both required and optional federal regulations so that Idaho's hazardous waste rules are the same as federal requirements. Op tional federal regulations usually allow more flexibility to the regulated community; required federal regulations are necessary to maintain program primacy. Adoption by reference allows the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) to keep its rules up to date with federal regulation changes and minimizes the EPA Region 10 effort needed to keep Idaho's authorization current. Adoption by reference also simplifies compliance for the regulated community. This proposed rule updates the federal regulations incorporated by reference to include those revised as of July 1, 2009. Groups interested in hazardous waste and handlers of hazardous waste including generators, transporters, and treatment, storage, and disposal facilities may be interested in commenting on this proposed rule. The proposed rule text is in legislative format. Language the agency proposes to add is underlined. Langu age the agency proposes to delete is struck out. It is these additions and deletions to which public comment should be addressed. After consideration of public comments, DEQ intends to present the final proposal to the Board of Environmental Quality at the Oc tober 2009 Board meeting for adoption as a pending rule. The rule is expected to be final and effective upon the conclusion of the 2010 legislative session if adopted by the Board and approved by the Legislature. FEE SUMMARY: The following is a specific description of the fee or charge imposed or increased: None. FISCAL IMPACT STATEMENT: The following is a specific description, if applicable, of any negative fiscal impact on the state general fund greater than ten thousa nd dollars ($10,000) during the fiscal year: N/A NEGOTIATED RULEMAKING: Due to the nature of this rulemaking, negotiations were not DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY Docket No. 58-0105-0901 Rules and Standards for Hazardous Waste PENDING RULE HEALTH & WELFARE COMMITTEE P age 459 2010 PENDING RULE BOOKheld.
