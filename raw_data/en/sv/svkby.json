While many people still choose video conferencing for its convenience, in-office appointments are now available again. However, while the office has a separate entrance, it is in a home that shares the central heating and air condition system. Consequently if, on a day a patient is scheduled to come into the office they have an active contagious illness (e.g., the influenza, COVID, etc.), or have recently been exposed to one, we ask them to reschedule to a video conference. A phone consultation may be possible if video conferencing is not technically feasible. See the [COVID-19 page](/COVID-19) for our perspective on the pandemic.

Testimonials A friend of mine referred me to Heartland Naturopathic Clinic after traditional medical methods hadn't helped me. I was treated very respectfully and thoroughly and was provided with a carefully tailored homeopathic treatment. The treatment gave me almost immediate relief from some pretty uncomfortable symptoms, so I was greatly appreciative. Really worth trying if you're interested in alternative and/or preventative treatments. Highly recommended. April F. Review Via Yelp I am so grateful for Dr. Bradley. With her help, I have seen major improvements not only in my physical health, but also in my mental/emotional well being. Her focus on the whole person is exactly the approach that I want and need.
