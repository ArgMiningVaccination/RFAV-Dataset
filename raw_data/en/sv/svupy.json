Instr uction will cover the legislative process; the judiciary and specialist tribunals; precedent; court hierarchies; legal reasoning; constitutional law; administrative law; contracts; and torts. Some elements of the unit will be tailored in accordance with the requirements of the particular specialist programmes. LAWS6186 Native Title - Co-Existence Perspectives The recognition of native title by the High Court in the Mabo decision introduced a profound challenge to earlier conceptions of Australian land law, land use management and resource development. State land regimes have had to grapple with the implications of domestic recognition of international themes of self determination and land rights for Indigenous peoples. The Commonwealth Government has also set standards for the recognition and protection of native title rights in enacting the Native TitleAct 1993 and its subsequent amendment. LAWS6257 Public Policy The aim of this unit is to provide an understanding of the role of government in a market economy andof the need for intervention in a wide range of policy areas, defined within the framework of welfare economics. Particular attention is given to the analysis of taxation, social insurance and regulation. Applications include detailed studies of policy issues central to the following:\u00b7 The Australian tax-benefit system \u00b7 Unemployment, health and retirement income insurance \u00b7 Environmental taxes, tradable permits and regulation \u00b7 Monopoly regulation and access pricing \u00b7 Intergenerational equity and growth The unit also provides a brief overview of empirical methodologies used in evaluating policy reforms in these areas. LAWS6198 Refugee Law This unit of study is designed to give students a critical understanding of how refugee law developedboth at international law and within Australia's domestic legal system. In particular it will examine:\u00b7 The international instruments and institutions created to deal with refugee flows; \u00b7 the refinement of the definition of \"refugee\" at international law; \u00b7 Australia's experience of refugee flows; \u00b7 the machinery established in Australia for the determination of refugee status and for the hearing of refugee appeals; \u00b7 the jurisprudence that has developed both at international law and through the Australian courts; \u00b7 the role of international organisations such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees; 5\u00b7 the theoretical bases for refugee protection and possible alternatives to the present protection models. The unit will also examine emergent issues such as the treatment of women refugee claimants; the rights of asylum seekers to J udicial oversight of failed refugee claims; and the relationship between refugee law and other human rights instruments including the ICCPR and the \"Torture Convention\". The unit complements Immigration and Nationality Law and Immigration and Labour Law, as well as other offerings in the Master of International Law and the Masters of Administrative Law and Policy.Completion of the course entitles students, who are registered migration agents, to 10 CPD points. CORPORATE & COMMERCIAL LAW LAWS6014 Advanced Financing T echniques This unit deals with commonly used commercial structures and techniques for large financings. The unit also examines the use of these structures and techniques in a range of commercial settings, such as takeovers and public/private infrastructure. It is an advanced unit, which assumes a good generalknowledge of Australian corporate law and corporate finance. The unit is taught by a team of legal experts with extensive experience in financing techniques. Particular topics covered include: lending to a trust; loan syndication; I nternational T rade Regulation This course follows on from LAWS 6063 - Internation al T rade Regulation, with an examination of selected topics on the law of the World T rade Organisation, and in respect of some topics by analysing the way that WTO law is reflected in domestic law (considering USA law and Australian law). Topics considered may include anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties, safeguard remedies, intellectual property protection under TRIPS, unilateral \"self-help\" trade sanctions, developing countries in world trade, the Article XX environmental exceptions, the SPS Agreement and quarantine, and trade andlabour. Time permitting, the course may extend the consideration of trade in services begun in LAWS 6063. LAWS6222 Comparative Corporate Governance A major issue in contemporary corporate governance debate is whether national governance systems can be expected to converge into a new international governance system, comprising best practices from diverse systems. While many commentators support this position, others take the view that major underlying legal and cultural differences between jurisdictions will ultimately prevent such convergence.This unit will examine recent trends in comparative corporate governance and discuss the interplay of governance techniques in a number of different jurisdictions, such as the US, Germany, Japan and Eastern Europe. It will also explore different approaches to fundamental governance issues such as directors' du ties and disclosure. 6LAWS6258 Competition Law in the Global Context This intensive postgraduate course will investigate the key questions facing competition law during the current era of globalisation. It will do so by: 1. Considering the key characteristics of the two most influential competition law regimes in the world today, the US model and the EU model, and by considering the key characteristics of the Australian system by comparison to them; then 2. Considering the impact of trade liberalization and the IT/communications revolution on commerce and its consequences for competition regulation. This will focus specifically upon four critical issues. (a) It will consider whether competition law can be harnessed within the WTO context to serve as an instrument of market liberalization to overcome purely private market-blocking arrangements not currently covered by GATT.(b) It will consider the impact of international hard core cartels and the question whether it is necessary/desirable for national regulators to go beyond current bilateral enforcement cooperation in order to combat such cartels. (c) It will consider the question of pre-notification and approval of mergers and the question whether there is a need to move towards a more harmonized approach in order(i) to avoid excessive transaction costs implied by the need to comply with the differing filing requirements of a multiplicity of national regulators; (ii) to avoid conflicting national decisions relating to global mergers. (d) It will consider the question of competition regulation of e-networks and the question whether national regulation can suffice in that regard; 3. Considering the responses to these issues proposed in various international fora (WTO, OECD, UNCTAD) by various national regulators (The US ICPAC Report, the EU Commission's proposals) and by private sector groups (The IBA and others); before 4. Considering the likely impact of such responses particularly in terms of substantive competition policy; commercial efficiency, legitimation or de-legitimati on of competition regula tion), impact on developing countries, institutional balance and democratic accountability. LAWS6264 Compliance: Theory and Practice in the Financial Services Industry This course will consider in detail the legal and regulatory requirements applying to the financialservices industry, including the major reforms introduced in March 2002 by the Financial Services Reform Act, and how the risk of breaching those requirements can be managed via compliance systems. In doing so, it will focus not only on legal theory, but also on the practical day to day business issuesassociated with compliance. The course will be divided into two parts: A. Core compliance issues: \u00b7 Licensing of financial service providers\u00b7 Compliance systems \u00b7 Insider trading and Chinese walls \u00b7 Market conduct rules \u00b7 Shareholding restrictions \u00b7 T rade practices\u00b7 Money laundering, bribery and corruption \u00b7 Retail customer obligations \u00b7 Privacy \u00b7 Miscellaneous compliance issues (trust account rules, fiduciary duties, conflicts of interest, confidentiality and telephone taping) \u00b7 Investigating compliance breaches (including reporting obligations and HR issues) 7B. Specialist compliance issues relevant to: \u00b7 Managed investments \u00b7 Financial planning\u00b7 Deposit products and non cash payment facilities \u00b7 Stockbroking \u00b7 Futures broking \u00b7 Insurance and insurance broking \u00b7 Superannuation\u00b7 Retirement Savings Accounts This course assumes a good general grasp of legal and equitable principles, including the common law, and a basic knowledge of undergraduate law subjects. LAWS6227 Consumer Protection Law Supplier Liability This unit involves a critical examination of aspects of recent developments granting special legalprotection to consumers. The unit is concerned with aspects of the liability of suppliers of goods and services to consumers, sometimes called 'post-sale' consumer protection. (This unit is complementary to Consumer Protection Law Regulation of Unfair Marketing Practices, but each unit can be taken independently). An assessment will be made of the effectiveness of recent legislation in this field, andthere will be some emphasis on a comparative approach with particular reference to a number of relevant European Community directives. The topics to be covered are: 1. Introduction (the \"consumer\" concept and some policy factors leading to consumer protection developments) 2. Outline of terms implied in contracts for the supply of goods and services to consumers3. Judicial and legislative control of exclusion clauses 4. Unconscionable and unfair contracts (control under the general law and by statute) 5. The control of unfair contracts: a comparative viewpoint; 6. The liability of manufacturers: the general law; statutory liability of manufacturers to consumers (particularly under T rade P ractices Act 1974 (C th),Part V , Division 2A); strict products liability (T rade Practices Act Part VA, with special re ference to the EC directive on products liability) 7. Product safety regulation (especially Trade Practices Act, Part V , Division 1A, with reference to the EC directive on general product safety); 8. Consumer access to redress. LAWS6226 Consumer Protection Law Unfair Marketing Practices This unit involves an examination of aspects of recent developments granting special legal protection to consumers. It is concerned with the regulation of unfair and deceptive marketing practices (This unit is complementary to Consumer Protection Law-Liability of Suppliers to Consumers, but each unit can be taken independently). An assessment will be made of the effectiveness of these provisions and their impact on the general law. The topics to be covered are: 1. Introduction (the \"consumer\" concept and some policy factors leading to consumer protection developments); 2. Misleading and deceptive conduct: the general prohib ition (T rade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) s52, Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) s 42); 3. False and misleading representations (T rade Practices Acts 53, Fair Trading Act s 43); 4. Other prohibited types of false representation and misleading conduct (Trade Practices Act ss 53A, 53B, 55, 55A, 59, Fair Trading Act ss 45, 46, 49, 50, 54); 5. Bait advertising; 6. \"Free\" gifts and promotional competitions; 87. Door-to-door selling and debt collection practices; 8. The role of codes of conduct and self-regulation in setting standards for business conduct9. The control of advertising: a comparative study; 10. The enforcement of marketing practices law: (a) criminal liability; (b) injunctions (including corrective advertising orders); (c) damages and other orders;(d) accessorial liability 11. Administrative bodies (the role of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and parallel state/territory agencies); 12. The impact of the marketing practices legislation on the general law of contract and tort. LAWS6250 Controlling Liability by Contract This course brings together the doctrinal, theoretical and practical issued raised by contract riskmanagement, especially the control of liability for breach of contract and negligence. The course will consider: categories of risk; drafting options; protection of third parties; statutory control of risk management devices, including the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth); contract drafting and management issues such as penalties and relief against forfeiture. The drafting options which are considered include the use of exclusion clauses, indemnity provisions and force majeure clauses. The operation of these types of clauses, and the relevant common law and statutory rules, will be considered in the context of various types of contracts, but with particular emphasis on contracts for the provision of services and sale of goods. One particular feature of the course is a consideration of the operation of the privity rule in the context of risk management. Thus, issues such as the protection of related bodies corporate and the liability of agents and sub-contractors are dealt with in some detail. LAWS6100 Corporate Fundraising The unit will involve a detailed study of the disclosure provisions and other requirements of Chapter 6Dof the Corporations Law, with particular focus on their application to the offer of company shares for issue or sale. However, some attention will also be given to listed managed investment schemes regulatedunder the Financial Services Reform Act. Attention will be paid to additional relevant legal requirements, including the ASX Listing Rules, for initial public offerings and other fund raisings. The unit is taught by lawyers with extensive experience in the field of corporate fundraising. It assumes a good general knowledge of Australian corporate law. LAWS6254 Curr ent Issues in Directors Duties Directors' duties are perhaps the most fundamental aspect of corporate governance. This unit will explore a wide range of issues concerning directors and their duties, with particular emphasis placed on the changes introduced by the Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (CLERP) reforms in 2000. The unit will also examine directors' duties in certain commercial scenarios, such as company meetings and takeovers. Particular topics covered include: directors' duty of care and diligence under s 180(1) of the Corporations Law; the duties of nominee directors; the extent of permissible delegation by directors; the scope of the business judgement rule under s 180(2) of the Corporations Law; the right of directors and ex-directors to inspect company books as an adjunct to fulfillment of their duties; enforcement of 9directors' duties via the statutory derivative action under Pt 2F .1A of the Corporations Law; indemnification of directors against liability or for legal expenses; the scope of the \"no conflicts\" duty for directors; the duty of directors to act for proper purposes; the duties of directors when conveningcompany meetings; the duties of directors in the context of takeovers; LAWS6246 International Banking Regulation This unit will introduce students to significant contemporary developments in international banking regulation, with particular emphasis on US banking regulation. Professor Geoffrey Miller, who is Director of the Centre for the Study of Central Banks at New York University Law School, will teach the unit. Professor Miller is internationally known for his scholarship in a wide range of areas, includingbanking regulation, corporate governance and securities regulation. LAWS6060 International Commercial Arbitration This unit will introduce students to international commercial arbitration, one of the preferred methodsof resolving international commercial disputes. The unit will examine the methodology of international arbitration, the conduct of arbitration proceedings, the challenge of arbitration awards, and the procedure for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards. A particular focus will be the tensionbetween globalisation and local diversity, and the development of international arbitration and mediation in the Asia-P acific region. LAWS6004 Restitution for Unjust Enrichment This unit aims to provide students with an opportunity to learn about an important and expanding area of the law of obligations, developed by the courts over the last ten years. The unit analyses the concept of unjust enrichment and the relationship between restitution, equity, contract and tort. The concept ofunjust enrichment is now accepted as the unifying basis for the law of restitution. A person is unjustly enriched whenever a benefit is received at the p laintiff 's expense in circumstances where the receipt or retention of that benefit is unjust. Relevant circumstances include mistake, duress and other improper pressure, failure of consideration or the receipt of benefits following wrongs such as tort, breach of contract and breaches of fiduciary duties. Both personal and proprietary claims will be considered. Theexpansion of the law of unjust enrichment has required a principled development of appropriate defences and the operation and availability of defences such as good consideration and change of position will be analysed. Legal Education 10CRIMINAL LAW AND CRIMINOLOGY LAWS6012 Adv anced Criminal Law This is a course of study that critically examines crime and its structures and institutions of control. It looks at criminal law within specific, modern social contexts. It builds on a basic understanding of the principles around which criminal laws are constructed and said to operate, as well as a preliminary knowledge of the processes employed for establishing criminal liability, and the factors which effectsuch determinations. From this the student is invited to contextualise their appreciation of the position, practice and potential of the criminal law within changing economic, political and cultural contexts, including globalisation. The course is intended as more than a detailed or detached examination of criminal laws. Rather, the manner in which the topics for discussion are presented and dealt with will allow participants to challenge some commonly assumed notions about the criminallaw, as well as appreciate the interests and influences behind recent developments in the criminal law and process. LAWS6015 Advanced Forensic Psychiatry This unit builds on the areas covered in Forensic Psyc hiatry. Topics covered include: the mental health and cognate legislation, the mental illness defence, diminished responsibility, automatism, pathological gambling, stalking, repressed memories, crime and amnesia, post-traumatic stressdisorder, multiple personality disorder , the use and abuse of psychiatric evidence, multiple victim homicide, psychopathy and dangerousness. LAWS6034 Criminal Liability This unit canvasses the ways in which criminal liability is established, and the central factorsgoverning liability. General principles of criminal law, constituent elements of particular offences and the definition of a range of defences are analysed from theoretical and practical perspectives. At moststages of the unit, the focus will be on male violence. Because this unit is an introduction to aspects of criminal law for non-lawyers, this unit is not open to students who have completed a law degree or passed criminal law at a tertiary level. LAWS6040 Drugs, Drug Policy and the Law This unit deals with the law relating to drug control policies in Australia, both at State and Federal levels (including international treaties). Background material on the nature and incidence of drug use,pharmacological and medical issues, as well as philosophic, economic, criminological and public policy literature will be considered where relevant. The unit covers substantive topics from criminal law, civil treatment and welfare law. Topics to be covered will include: the context, including: history of drug policy; State/Federal division of responsibility; nature and incidence of use of substances; international and domestic policy constraints and debates; the law enforcement elements, including: detection ofdrug offences; special powers; investigation, prosecution; elements of drug offences possession/use, trading, cultivation, manufacture, importation; sentencing options/directives; sentencing characterisation of levels; confiscation of assets; civil treatment, including: the history of civl commitment; the civil commitment model; a public health (detoxification) non-legislative options; including: income support; services;overview/summary, including: options and directions for change. 11LAWS6194 Explaining Punishment The objective of this unit is to explore punishment, sentencing and penalty in modern society, particularly through an understanding of the relationship between punishment and social structure and the significance of punishment within the social and political order. The unit will adopt an interdisciplinary approach which draws on history , law, literature, sociology and criminology. Topics which will be cover ed include new sentencing regimes (such as mandatory sentencing), women in prison, juvenile imprisonment, inequality and punishment, privatisation, and the impact of law and order politics on punishment. LAWS6245 Policing Bodies: Crime, Sexuality and Reproduction This unit will draw upon feminist and critical theories to analyse selected sexual and reproductive practices that the criminal law has considered, or may in the future consider, problematic. These studies will be unified by the general course objective of theorising the relationship between criminalisation and medical technologies concerning the body. St udents will have the opportunity to examine specific applications of the criminal law in relation to sexual desire, body alteration andreproduction. In particular, the unit will consider homosexual sexual practices; sado-masochistic sexual practices and female genital alterations; abortion, sex selection and infanticide; drug use and HIV transmission during pregnancy; and enforced sterilisation and abortion. Each case study will provide a concrete context in which to consider the role of criminal law in the construction of subjects which require supervision (eg gay, lesbian, transgendered, fetal, maternal) and the construction of risks thatmay be palliated by criminalisation. The intersections between race, sex, gender, class and sexuality in these constructions will also be considered. Throughout the course, students will reflect on the extent to which 'medical' and 'criminal' responses to the practices considered are collaborative. This unit will equip students to think critically about the interplay between technologies of the body and crime, and to map possible future directions for criminal law and public policy. ENVIRONMENTAL LAW LAWS6041 Environmental Dispute Resolution This unit aims to explore the nature of environmental disputes and the means of resolving them. Themeans examined include judicial review, administrative appeals and public inquiries and non- adjudicative or consensual means such as mediation. Critical evaluation of the forms and limits of dispute resolution strategies, including appropriateness of each means in resolving different types ofenvironmental disputes, will be explored. The unit involves the use of innovative teaching techniques: lectures will be alternated with small group workshops, mediation simulations, a public inquiry and a mock court-hearing. In addition to the lecturers, there are guest lecturers including (subject to availability) a Land and Environment Court judge, Commissioner of Inquiry, Senior Counsel and a trained mediator from the Land and Environment Court. Participation in the practical exercises is a compulsory condition of the unit. 12LAWS6043 Environmental Impact Assessment Law This unit has three fundamental aims. The first is to provide a sound analysis of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) procedures in NSW and at the Commonwealth level. The second aim is to develop a critical understanding of EIA as a distinctive regulatory device by examining its historical, ethical and political dimensions as well as relevant aspects of legal theory. The third and ultimate aim is to combine these doctrinal and theoretical forms of knowledge so we can suggest possible improvements to thecurrent practice of EIA in Australia. LAWS6061 International Environmental Law This unit aims to provide students with an overview of the development of international environmentallaw throughout the twentieth century. Attention will primarily be devoted to the international law and policy responses to global and regional environmental and resource management issues. Basic principles will be discussed prior to taking a sectoral approach in looking at the application of internationalenvironmental law in specific issue areas. The unit includes material on implementation of international environmental law in the Asia Pacific region. Relev ant Australian laws and initiatives will be referred to from time to time. The focus is on law and policy that has been applied to deal with environmental problems in an international and trans-boundary context. LAWS6173 T rade and Environment This unit of study examines the sources of tension between the law and policy aspects of the international trade liberalisation regime, environmental protection and ecologically sustainable development. It examines the obligations imposed by the World T rade Organisa tion (WTO) framework and the scope and operation of environmental exceptions that have been considered in recent trade- environment disputes. It explores these developments from the perspective of parallel initiatives in international law aimed at promoting Ecologically Sustainable Development domestically and globally.The Agreements on Food Safety Standards and Technical Barriers to Trade are al so covered to the extent that they impose limitations on nations' ability to specify the manner in which foods and other traded goods are manufactured or processed. Tensions between the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and the rights and duties created by the Convention on Biodiversity are also discussed. The unit contrasts the WTO regime with that implemented by regional trade groups such as the European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) and attempts some evaluation of their relative strengths in promoting ESD. It also reflects on the attempts to negotiate an agreement on investment liberalisation and the issues that raises for environmental protection initiatives. By the end of the unit participants should be able to critically assess the prospects for future harmonisation of global free traderegimes and ESD principles in the context of the Australian debate on these issues. 13HEAL TH LAW LAWS6052 Govt Regulation, H ealth Policy & Ethics This unit examines government regulation of health care, drugs, resource allocation, medical research and professional practice. With regard to each area of government decision-making, issues are analysed by reference to the interplay between social goals, human rights, legal rights and ethical considerations. Topics covered include the constitutional and statutory sources of government power with respect to health care: regulatory models and reform of public health legislation; therapeutic goods administration;health insurance; pharmaceutical benefits and the pharmacy industry; immunisiation, notifiable diseases and public health emergencies; human tissue legislation; discipline of health professionals; health care complaints tribunals; a right to health care; ethical theories in law and medicine; the ethics of human experimentation; and ethics committees. LAWS6248 Legal Issues in Sports Medicine This unit will explore the rapidly deepening and widening interface between law and medicine in the arena of sport. The initial focus of the course will be upon analysing the legal relationship between the sports medicine doctor and the athlete-patient. This will include standards of care, responsibility for injury and the obligation of confidentiality. The impact on the structure and nature of the relationship caused by the circumstances of elite competition and the doctors dual responsibilities to athlete and team will be featured. Related issues such as working with other health professionals in the sportsmedicine team, travelling with teams, insurance and vicarious liability will be considered. The second part of the course will examine the legal aspects of a number of specific issues in sports medicine such as infectious diseases, performance-enhancing drugs, the pregnant athlete and the sex status of participants. It will do so against the backdrop of the impact of changing medical knowledgeand practices. Particular attention will be paid to anti-discrimination law. Each of these issues has a counterpart outside of sport and the making of comparisons will invite consideration of whether the sport setting requires special approaches or even offers valuable insights into wider debates. INTERNATIONAL LAW LAWS6202 I nternational Dispute Resolution This unit of study aims to provide an in-depth analysis of international dispute resolution as a technique for resolving public international law disputes. The United Nations Charter provisions for the peaceful settlement of international disputes will be taken as creating the basic framework for the review of dispute resolution techniques. These include negotiation, good offices, mediation, conciliation, arbitration and adjudication. Particular attention will be given to in-depth analysis of certain disputes and the legal and political techniques used in their resolution. These disputes willinclude the Iranian Hostages case, the Rainbow Warrior case, French Nuclear Testing, and East Timor. This unit will not deal with the resolution of international commercial disputes of a private law character. LAWS6062 International Law and Use of Armed Force This unit will survey and anaylse the principles of customary international law and the rules ofconventional law which apply in the case of armed conflict between states. The role of the UnitedNations in preventative diplomacy, peace-keeping, peace enforcement, and the authorisation of the 14collective use of force will be included. Consideration will also be given to police enforcement action by States and self defence. Case studies dealing with the Gulf War, NATO action in Kosovo, and the INTERFET operation in East Timor will be considered. This unit will not give detailed considerationto International Humanitarian Law and is designed to complement the unit in that area. LAWS6137 Maritime Law This unit of study aims to provide students with an understanding of both domestic and internationallaw as they apply to shipping from the initial stage of ship registration to salvage and wreck. The unit will cover public law issues in ship operation within Australia, such as ownership, registration and admiralty jurisdiction. The course also covers charter parties, bills of lading and marine insurance. Inconclusion the unit looks at both Australian and international law dealing with salvage and wreck. LAWS6208 Trade and Commerce in European Law This unit is designed to introduce students to the operation of the legal system of the EuropeanCommunity as it affects trade and commerce. In this unit, students will focus on the four fundamental freedoms upon which the single European market is based: the free movement of goods, people, capital and services.
