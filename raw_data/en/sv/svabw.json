The suggestions contained in this publication are generally agreed upon and are recom-mended for consideration by all California science teachers. Because this publication has been pre-pared for statewide distribution, not all of the recommended policies are appropriate for adoption in allschool districts. The ideas presented may be adapted to meet the needs of teachers and students in eachdistrict. This publication is designed for use by laboratory instructors and, therefore, provides minimal information directed to students, parents, and administrators about the safety procedures necessary inthe science laboratory. Some materials, such as parental consent forms and sample student safetycontracts, have been included in the appendixes to help teachers communicate with other audiences. SONIA HERNANDEZ ROBERT A.

I NTRODUCTION1 A. Responsibilities of Students and Parents 2 B. Reasonable Laboratory Class Size 2 C. Teacher's Liability 4 D. State and Federal Legislation Affecting Science Instruction 5LABORATORY ACTIVITIES AND DEMONSTRATIONS represent an essential part of effective science teaching. Written materials and pictures can convey an enormous amount of information, butstudents more fully understand the concepts related toscience when they participate in or observe learningactivities involving laboratory experiments anddemonstrations. In addition, those activities allowstudents to learn the processes and techniques ofscience laboratory investigation. Students who go tocolleges and universities and take advanced sciencecourses are expected to know laboratory procedures.The Science Framework for California Public Schools, K-12, specifies that \"of the total time spent learning science, at least 40 percent should be involved inactivity-based lessons.\" 1 This concept applies in kindergarten through grade twelve.appreciate scientific methods. The National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) promotes extensive useof laboratory investigations and field trips in scienceinstruction and urges that \"school districts and teachersshould share the responsibilities of establishing safetystandards and seeing that they are adhered to.\" 2 Science teachers must be advocates of safety and have the information and attitudes necessary to informcommunity and school groups and involve them insupport of activity-based science classes. Schooladministrators and district administrative staff must beactive supporters of hands-on science experiences.Administrators must be kept informed of laboratoryactivities and concomitant safety precautions and mustdevote resources to make such experiences possible.Parents, too, must be aware of and approve the labora-tory experiences their students will have. Science teachers are in a unique position to orient school administrators to the attitudes,skills, rational thinking processes, and knowl-edge resulting from laboratory activities.Many science laboratory exercises use readilyavailable materials and may be inexpensive toconduct. This information should be conveyedto administrators to increase their appreciationof the number, variety, and cost effectivenessof experiments. The main point is that admin-istrators who observe student motivationresulting from laboratory participation will bemore likely to increase their support foractivities requiring more resources. To ensurethat support, science teachers will need toprovide evidence that appropriate safetyprecautions have been taken. This emphasis on safety is reflected in the guidelines of the Interna-tional Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), which hasestablished rules that are \"intended to ensure the safetyof students, to protect the subjects and environmentsstudied, and to limit the liability of the adults whoassist with the projects.\" 31.

Washington, D.C.: Science Service, Inc., 1995.Although many science activities present potential hazards, reasonable and prudent safety practicesgreatly reduce the likelihood of accidents. Whenstudents adhere strictly to standard safety precautions,they are unlikely to encounter any risks greater thanthose they might encounter in physical education,vocational education, or home economics classes.Knowing about possible hazards and taking precau-tions are the basis for creating a safe learning environ-ment. All students studying science benefit frompracticing safety procedures and from learning to 1Chapter 1. Introduction2 Responsibilities of Students and Parents Through their own educational background and training, most science teachers have learned to use safelaboratory techniques as a matter of course. Becausemany students have not had the opportunities at homeand in school to observe and practice safety proce-dures, the science laboratory is a good place to beginlearning the fundamentals. Students have a responsi-bility to themselves and their classmates to learn andobserve safety practices in all participatory scienceactivities. In addition, students should adopt positiveattitudes about the need for safety in a laboratorysetting. Students' interest in science activities must bechanneled constructively so that capricious, carelessactions do not occur. The following practices, skills, or areas of knowl- edge are among the issues dealt with in this handbookand should be taught in most laboratory classes (seealso Appendix B, Education Code Section 51202): Proper eye-care safety practices Proper handling of glassware and glass tubing Proper setup and handling of electrical equipment Safe use of chemicals in the laboratory Correct methods for storing, handling, and dispos- ing of surplus, waste, and deteriorated chemicalsubstances Appropriate, safe use of heat sources in the labora- tory First-aid procedures Prompt notification to appropriate individuals or agencies of any dangerous or potentially dangerousconditions Appropriate, safe, and humane treatment of ani- mals Prohibition of the use or presence of any venomous animals, poisonous plants, or plant pests Proper fire prevention and control techniques Correct methods for cleanup after experiments Proper behavior and courtesy in a laboratory situation Earthquake-safe behavior and evacuation routes Parents should be aware of the kinds of science laboratory activities that will be conducted and beencouraged to sign consent forms for their children'sparticipation. The consent forms (see examplesincluded in appendixes F, J, and P) do not constitute a legal release from joint and several liability but are away of informing parents that safety procedures existat school and are a part of the students' safety training.Consent forms should be considered contracts forpartnership, not abdication of control. Parents arewelcome in the science laboratories, just as they are inother classes. (Of course, they will have to wearprotective goggles and follow other safety proceduresexpected of the students.) Parents are encouraged tosupport the school science program and to reinforcethe curricular objectives of the course through familyactivities, such as museum visits, field trips, and so on.Parents of students participating in science fairs shouldexpect to work with the teacher to ensure that safetyprocedures are understood and adhered to by all. Reasonable Laboratory Class Size No current legal mandate prescribes special limits on class size in science laboratories. The Uniform Fire Code classifies science laboratory classes as academic subjects and specifies 20 square feet per student as aminimum standard, in contrast to a vocational educa-tion class for which the requirement is 50 square feetper student. In reality, more than 20 square feet perBA 3 pupil are required for hands-on laboratory science activities. That criterion is reflected in California Code of Regulations, Title 2, Section 1811(g)(2), which requires the state architect to design laboratory class-rooms for occupancy by 26 students in grades seventhrough twelve or 24 students in grades nine throughtwelve. These design specifications are generallyunderstood by state and local agencies to be equivalentto 1,300 square feet of floor space, including prepara-tion and storage areas. Therefore, teachers and administrators need to take several considerations into account in establishingreasonable limits on the number of students in alaboratory setting to ensure maximum safety withinthe science laboratory. These considerations include: 1. The space required for each student to perform experiments safely 2. The safety features in the design of the facilities or space 3. The level of maturity and safety knowledge that students bring to the science laboratory 4. The number of students that one teacher can supervise during a potentially dangerous activity 5. The nature and degree of increased hazard and liability when the class size exceeds 24 students One of the Science Framework guidelines apply- ing to safe conditions for science instruction encour-ages the practical attitude that \"the number of studentsin the laboratory classroom should be determined byfactors such as safety, number of stations, and totalclassroom square footage, rather than school schedul-ing needs.\" 4 Laboratory Capacity Faculty cannot be expected to monitor an over- crowded laboratory when potentially hazardousexperiments are being conducted. No one, whetherstudent, teacher, or administrator, wants the increasedrisk of having too many students in a science labora-tory class. But overcrowding still occurs. It is adifficult risk-benefit decision for school administratorsto set limits on laboratory class size. However, if alarge number of students must be placed in an inad-equately designed facility, there are ways to providesupervisory assistance for the teacher. An obviousalternative is to add an advanced high school student, acollege student, or a retired science specialist as anaide (monitor) during the potentially hazardouslaboratory period; or other teachers may be willing to help supervise the laboratory. Another alternative is toschedule additional laboratory sections to reduce theclass size. Teachers should express their safety con-cerns, in writing, to their department chairperson andschool-site administrator. Under no circumstancesshould laboratory instruction proceed when thenumber of participating students exceeds the designcapacity of the laboratory. Students' Safety Experience In determining laboratory class size, the teacher, department head, and principal should assess thestudents' backgrounds in relation to safety. Somegroups of students come to the science laboratory withsafety training; these groups include students fromprevious science (laboratory) classes and from manyvocational education courses. Students who have beeninstructed in safety and first-aid procedures are less atrisk than those who lack such training. In addition,some groups of students demonstrate a more maturecapacity for greater responsibility and, therefore, allowa greater sense of security in the laboratory. Section Aof this introduction addresses the students' responsibil-ity to learn safety practices; the materials in thereferences and appendixes provide the teacher withadditional help in preparing students for safety. Facilities No amount of student screening can make up for overcrowded or potentially unsafe laboratory settings.A primary concern is the physical distance betweenstudents and between work stations in the laboratory.Many school laboratory stations that are designed fortwo pairs of students add a fifth student in the aisle.This practice crowds the students and blocks trafficlanes, inviting accidents and preventing orderlyevacuation and administration of first-aid procedures. Most laboratories were designed for a specific number of students, and that number should not beexceeded. For example, a chemistry classroom with asingle vented hood was not designed for volatile toxicchemicals to be tested simultaneously by 30 or morestudents. Therefore, prudent planning of the laboratoryprogram is necessary. Similarly, laboratories withsingle or distant eyewash and first-aid stations cannotaccommodate multiple injury or emergency victims.Alternative actions must be considered. Teachers are encouraged to work with their administrators to identify and alleviate potential 4Science Framework, p. 178.B. Reasonable Laboratory Class SizeChapter 1. Introduction4 hazards due to overcrowding and limitations in facilities. The objective should be to guarantee thesafest possible environment in which to conductexperiments without reducing the number or quality ofactivity-based science lessons. Teacher's Liability Laws and regulations at the national, state, county, city, and school district levels are explicit enough toplace direct responsibility on teachers, administrators,school board members, and school district sciencespecialists for the safety of students in science class-rooms. In the existing climate of accountability andliability for the safe conduct of educational processes,the science teacher comes under close scrutiny.Although protected to a degree by a school district'slegal resources, the teacher is vulnerable to profession-ally and personally damaging lawsuits. It is important to plan preventive steps that will minimize accidents and reduce both indi-vidual and district liabilities. Essentially, suchsteps include effective safety instruction, carefulsupervision of all activities, and proper mainte-nance of laboratory and classroom equipment.Because school districts and the classroominstructors, on occasion, may become involvedwhen students are injured or negligence occurs,staff should recognize that the court examinesthe circumstances and conduct of the responsibleindividuals to ascertain whether their conduct,actions, judgment, and behavior were reasonableand prudent under the given circumstances.Through an analysis of the actions taken by theschool, the school district, and the individual, the courtdetermines the degree of responsibility that can beattributed to the parties involved. The court also testsindividuals, using the \"reasonable man\" rule, todetermine whether the individual exercised the properdegree of caution and judgment that an average personof his or her training and background would haveexercised under similar circumstances. (See AppendixA for [1] sample cases testing the liability of scienceteachers; and [2] the NSTA's position statement titled\"Liability of Teachers for Laboratory Safety and FieldTrips.\") Fortunately, many resources exist to helpteachers gain expertise in safe ways of conductingdemonstrations and laboratory activities.Posting safety guidelines and procedures (sug- gested or sample study sheets for safe use of chemi-cals, lasers, heating, and so on) is a recommendedpractice for science classrooms, but the courts havedeclared posting to be insufficient, in and of itself, toensure students' safety. The science teacher mustcontinually remind students of both general andspecific hazards before the performance of laboratoryactivities in which any element of danger might exist.If a textbook or laboratory manual specifies a danger-ous procedure, which neither the students nor theinstructor can reasonably carry out, then the teachermust ensure that the procedure is not followed but isreplaced with a safe one. Students should not beallowed unsupervised access to potentially dangerousmaterials or equipment and should be under continualsupervision in all laboratory situations (for the safetyof both student and equipment). Monitoring or super-vising a laboratory setup during passing periods is anessential consideration. C Specific safety instruction and testing are highly recommended as an integral part of every scienceclassroom procedure. This handbook includes sug-gested safety procedures and a student safety test thatmay be adapted for use in the teaching of variousscientific disciplines (see Chapter 3 and Appendixes F,G, J, and P). The checklist in Appendix H will behelpful in assessing the safety features of classroom/laboratories, preparation areas, and storerooms. Andthe \"Science Laboratory Safety/Liability Checklist\" inAppendix L is designed to assist department chairs andadministrative staff in evaluating the effectiveness offacilities and established procedures regarding acci-dent prevention and the potential liability of the schoolor school district. 5 State and Federal Legislation Affecting Science Instruction Legislative enactments since 1982 have had a significant impact on safety in science instruction andon the duties of science teachers. The following are thetopics of those enactments: 1. Hazardous materials education ( Education Code Section 49340 et seq.) 2. Removal of chemicals ( Education Code Section 49411) 3. Occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories; chemical hygiene plan ( California Code of Regulations, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Section 5191) 4. Bloodborne pathogens ( California Code of Regulations, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Section 5193) 5. Hazard communication; material safety data sheets (California Code of Regulations, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Section 5194) 6. Repeal of requirement for obtaining an extremely hazardous waste disposal permit ( Health and Safety Code Section 25153) 7. Hazardous materials release response plans and inventory ( Health and Safety Code, Chapter 6.95, Section 25500 et seq.) Significant excerpts of these (and other) laws are cited in Appendix B. Summaries of the recent enact-ments are provided below: 1. Hazardous materials education ( Education Code Section 49340 et seq.) This legislation recognizes the potentially hazard- ous nature of materials and procedures used inschool science laboratories and the need foreducators to increase the awareness of personsdealing with the materials to minimize the dan-gers. Each school is encouraged to designate atrained member of its professional staff as thebuilding laboratory consultant responsible forreviewing, updating, and carrying out the school'sadopted procedures for laboratory safety. The Legislature urges the California Department of Education to assume the leadership necessaryto provide qualified individuals with the skills andmaterials to assist schools and teachers in thedevelopment of their laboratory safety policiesand procedures.School districts are encouraged to take steps to ensure that hazardous materials are properly usedand stored; the governing boards may requestconsultation services from the California Occupa-tional Safety and Health (Cal/OSHA) Consulta-tion Service. 2. Removal of chemicals ( Education Code Section 49411) The California Department of Education, in cooperation with the Division of OccupationalSafety and Health, shall prepare a list of chemi-cals used in school programs that includes thepotential hazards and estimated shelf life of eachchemical or chemical compound and developguidelines for school districts for the regularremoval and disposal of all chemicals whoseestimated shelf life has elapsed. DD. State and Federal Legislation Affecting Science Instruction The county superintendent of schools may imple-ment a system for disposing of chemicals fromschools within the county or may permit schooldistricts to arrange for the disposal of the chemi-cals. Note: School districts and county departments of education can request reimbursement for the costsof implementing and maintaining a program forthe regular removal and disposal of all chemicals Chapter 1. Introduction6 whose shelf life has elapsed, in accordance with the guidelines, if they certified to the Superinten- dent of Public Instruction by June 30, 1988, thatthe district was in compliance with the guidelines.See Appendix C for more information on reim-bursable costs and details for filing claims forreimbursement. 3. Occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals in laboratories; chemical hygiene plan ( California Code of Regulations, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Section 5191) This legislation requires all employers engaged in the laboratory use of hazardous chemicals to takespecific action toward minimizing employeeexposure to such chemicals. Employers mustdevelop a chemical hygiene plan that includes: Safe operating procedures Protective equipment Maintenance of proper labeling on hazardous substances Retention of all MSDSs received from vendors; MSDSs to be made available toemployees Employee information and training Provisions for medical consultations and examinations Designation of a chemical hygiene officer to implement and maintain the plan Employee information and training on the hazards of chemicals present in the work area shall beprovided at the time of an employee's initialassignment to his or her work area and prior toassignments involving new exposure situations.Refresher information and training shall beprovided at intervals determined by the employer. The chemical hygiene plan shall be readily available to employees, employee representatives,and, on request, the Chief of the Division ofOccupational Safety and Health. 4. Bloodborne pathogens ( California Code of Regulations, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Section 5193) This regulation applies to all employers whose employees are subject to reasonably anticipatedexposure of their skin, eyes, or mucous mem-branes, or through parenteral contact, to blood orother potentially infectious materials as a result ofthe performance of the employees' duties.Employers are required to establish a written exposure control plan (ECP) designed to eliminateor minimize employee exposure. The ECP mustcontain at least the following elements: Determination of employees who may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens (schoolnurses, physical education teachers, schoolsecurity personnel, science teachers) Methods of compliance (engineering and work practice controls, personal protectiveequipment, houskeeping procedures) Hepatitis B vaccination Postexposure evaluation and follow-up Hazard communication information (labels and signs) and training Recordkeeping Because science classes include a variety of hands-on laboratory activities in which the use ofglassware and sharp instruments may result incuts and abrasions, science teachers should be anintegral part of and in compliance with theirschool's exposure control plan. 5. Hazard communication; material safety data sheets (MSDS) ( California Code of Regulations, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Section 5194) According to Section 5194 of the General Indus- try Safety Orders, laboratories not engaged ineither production of hazardous substances forcommercial purposes or provision of qualitycontrol analysis for production processes arepartially exempt from the requirements of obtain- 7 ing a material safety data sheet (MSDS) from the manufacturer, of complying with the writtenhazard communication program, and of labelingcontainers (except as required by other safetyorders regulating labels) when all the followingconditions are satisfied: (1) all exposed employees(professional, technical, janitorial, and mainte-nance) are under the direct supervision andregular observation of an individual who hasknowledge of the physical and health hazards andemergency procedures involved; and (2) thesupervisor conveys this knowledge to employees in terms of safe work practices. Such exempted laboratories must also ensure that labels ofincoming containers of hazardous substances arenot removed or defaced and must maintain anyMSDSs that are received with incoming ship-ments of hazardous substances and ensure thatthose MSDSs are readily available to laboratoryemployees. 6. Repeal of requirement for obtaining an extremely hazardous waste disposal permit ( Health and Safety Code Section 25153) No special or additional permits are now required for the storage, treatment, transportation, anddisposal of extremely hazardous waste. Suchwaste is subject to the same requirements ashazardous waste. Producers and transporters of extremely hazard- ous waste are required, on an annual basis, tonotify and to send a tax return to the Board ofEqualization. On receipt of a bill from the Board,the business is to pay an annual fee. 7. Hazardous materials release response plans and inventory ( Health and Safety Code, Chapter 6.95, Section 25500 et seq.)The code requires every county to implement, through a designated administering agency,existing law providing for a governmental re-sponse to a release or threatened release ofhazardous substances. (A city could assume thatresponsibility within its boundary.) Any business which handles a hazardous material must establish a specified business plan, inaccordance with the standards of the Office ofEmergency Services, for emergency response to arelease or threatened release of the hazardousmaterial. Any business which handles a hazardous material must submit a specified inventory annually to theadministering agency. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 25503.5, businesses which have less than 500 pounds orless than a total of 55 gallons or 200 cubic feet, atstandard temperature and pressure (for com-pressed gas), of a hazardous material may beexempt from establishing and implementing anemergency response plan. Note: A handbook entitled Guide to Hazardous Substances Reporting Requirements was devel- oped in 1991 by the California EnvironmentalProtection Agency (Cal/EPA) and the ChemicalEmergency Planning and Response Commissionto help organizations comply with this legislation.Copies are available for $30 each from: Cal/EPA Environmental Information 555 Capitol Mall, Suite 3525Sacramento, CA 95814 Make checks payable to Environmental Informa- tion.D.

Shock 15UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES THE SCHOOL nurse will direct the activities necessary for treatments of illness, injury, or other health problems of students. However, at times the nurse maynot be available for first aid on the school premisesbecause his or her other responsibilities may includemaking home calls, transporting students, and engag-ing in health education duties. At those times theteacher needs to take appropriate action. Each scienceclassroom should be equipped with appropriate first-aid and safety materials (see Appendix D).Once assistance is given, it should be continued until the problem is resolved or until the patient isreleased to qualified medical help, the parent, oranother responsible person. Measures should be takento reduce any anxiety or fear that the injured student orother students may experience. A written accidentreport should be given to the school-site administratorwhen any such incident occurs; see Appendix D for asample Accident Report. Do's in First Aid 1.Do be cool, calm, and collected. Most cases are not serious. 2.Do obtain staff assistance, if necessary. 3.Do handle the person as little as possible. Do not move the person until the evaluation is complete. On completion of the emergency-handling phase: 4.Do check with the victim and with any witnesses about what happened. 5.Do make a prompt, complete, and accurate report of the incident to the department chairperson andthe administration. 6.Do be concerned with injuries that occurred on the way to and from school as well as those that occurat school. Don'ts in First Aid 1.Don't give liquids (or medicines) to an uncon- scious person. 2.Don't try to arouse an unconscious person. 3.Don't cut the skin, break blisters, and so forth. 4.Don't diagnose. 5.Don't give medical advice. 6.Don't reduce dislocations. 7.Don't transport an injured student in a private car. 8.Don't send a student home before consulting a parent. 9.Don't treat injuries that happened at home. Bites by Snakes, Spiders, Insects, and Mammals Rattlesnakes are the most common naturally occurring poisonous snakes in California. They arecommon in canyons, mountains, deserts, and new2. F IRST AID A BGeneral Information If a student becomes ill or is injured, the teacher is expected to act in an informed and objective manner,with a minimum of emotional expression. The teacherneeds to evaluate the problem, with special attention tothe following symptoms: Difficulties in breathing\u2014Start artificial respiration if breathing is absent; obtain a trained person togive CPR, if needed. The presence of bleeding\u2014If necessary, control the bleeding in compliance with the school'sbloodborne pathogens exposure control plan. The presence of shock\u2014If necessary, initiate treatment. 9 Chapter 1. Introduction10 construction areas. Few adolescents or adults die from rattlesnake bites, although such bites inflicted on smallchildren are considered especially serious. Bites byinsects seldom result in death, but the ensuing pain anddiscomfort may be minimized by early intervention.Dogs often come onto the school grounds and bitestudents, and human bites occasionally occur inschools. Such bites often become infected and shouldbe referred to a physician for treatment and continuedobservation. Poisonous Snake Bites 1. The victim should be kept at absolute rest. Trans- port the victim to a source of medical attention assoon as possible. Treat for shock. 2. Incision of the wound is dangerous and should be undertaken only by medical professionals. Anincision is a surgical procedure that should beperformed by trained specialists. A sterile fieldand sterile instruments must be used. 3. The major effort of the teacher should be to quiet the victim and effect immediate transportation tothe nearest medical facility in which an expertevaluation can be followed by the most appropri-ate action. When any wound that is caused by apoisonous snake occurs on school premises,expert emergency-room help would be closeenough so that a teacher would not have toperform an incision. 4. Poison information centers recommend the following steps: a. Keep the victim still. Transport to medical care as soon as possible. b. Place the injured extremity in a lowered position to retard the flow of the toxins tothe victim's heart. c. Apply a constricting band 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) above the wound if the bite is on thearm or leg. The band should be snug butloose enough to allow blood to flow to thelimb. d. Cool the extremity with cold compresses, if possible, until the person arrives at thehospital but do not pack the wound in ice. e. Do not cut the wound area. A person injured at school is usually within one hour of beingadmitted to an emergency room and receiv-ing expert care.Spider Bites 1. Use a cold application and apply soothing lotions, such as calamine lotion. 2. Refer a student with black-widow spider bites to the nurse and the student's parents for medicalattention. Generally, the bites are not consideredto be medically urgent unless the school nursealerts you that the student has had an allergicreaction. Bee Stings 1. Observe the person for an allergic reaction while carrying out steps 2 through 6 described below.Some of the signs to look for would be: Difficult breathing Dry, hacking cough Swelling and itching about the eyes Sense of constriction in the throat or chest Massive rash Sneezing and wheezing Sense of uneasiness These symptoms usually occur within minutes, and such victims should be seen by a physicianright away. Occasionally, the reactions are de-layed. 2. Remove the stinger by scraping it with a finger- nail or the blunt edge of a knife. To avoid releas-ing more venom, do not squeeze the end of thestinger by pulling it out with your fingers. 3. Wash the area of the sting well with soap and water. 4. Cover the sting with moistened meat tenderizer containing the enzyme papain. (Check ingredientson the label for the word papain.) 5. Place an ice pack on the sting. Do not put ice directly on the skin. Use an ice bag or wrap ice ina cloth. 6. Seek medical evaluation if the swelling becomes severe. Observe for infection, especially if stungby a wasp or yellow jacket, both of which areknown to carry bacteria. Mammal Bites There is danger of infection and rabies from the bites of all warm-blooded animals. Students should beadvised not to approach strange dogs and other ani-mals, especially a familiar pet that is acting peculiarly.Bats and skunks that are active in daytime must beconsidered rabid.Chapter 2. First Aid11 First-aid treatment consists of washing and flushing out the wounds thoroughly with strong warmsoap or detergent solution as quickly as possible.Continue the washing for at least 10 minutes. Thevalue of this procedure is greatest when performedduring the first hour or two. Refer to parents formedical follow-up. Catch the animal, if that is deemedsafe to do, and obtain information on the animal. Thencall the local animal control agency. Burns Because heat sources and corrosive chemicals are used in many laboratory science activities, there is thepotential for burns to occur from either source. Ifsomeone is burned, the following procedures areappropriate: Chemical Burns of the Skin (usually from strong acids or alkalies) This kind of burn needs to be washed with large amounts of water. Use a shower or hose at low pres- sure (a forceful stream of water may further injure theburned skin) for at least 10 minutes. Remove clothing from the affected area while the skin is being flushed. Some chemical containers may suggest other helpfulfirst-aid measures on the label; those may be used forthat particular chemical. Do not attempt to neutralize any chemical; by doing so you may cause further chemical reaction and more damage. Apply a dressingand obtain medical aid by following the serious injuryor illness routine. Chemical Burns of the Eye See section D, \"Eye Injuries,\" in this chapter. Nonchemical Burns of the Skin The degree or extent of burns and the percentage of skin surface involved usually determine the first-aidmeasures to be used. In general, adults who havesuffered burns over 10 percent of their body surface(or a child with 2 percent to 10 percent burns) requirehospitalization. Burns on the face suggest possibleinjury to the respiratory tract and may obstruct breath-ing as facial swelling increases. Prompt medical attention is imperative. First-degree burns mean minor burns, such as those resulting from overexposure to the sun or fromlight contact with a hot object. The usual signs areredness or discoloration together with mild swellingand pain. First aid includes cool water applications or submersion of the burned area in cool water for nolonger than 10 minutes to stop the burning process.Follow with a dry dressing, if necessary. Second-degree burns may result from a very deep sunburn, contact with hot liquids, or flash burns fromflammable products. These burns are usually of greaterdepth than first-degree burns and have a red appear-ance. Blisters are usually present. First aid for second-degree burns entails (1) immersing the burned part incool water ( not in ice water) for a few minutes (water at room temperature or less is appropriate); (2) apply-ing dry, sterile gauze or a clean cloth as a protectivebandage; (3) taking precautions against breaking intactblisters or removing tissue; (4) avoiding an antisepticpreparation, ointment, spray, or home remedy if theburn is severe or covers more than 10 percent of thebody; (5) keeping affected arms or legs elevated; and(6) seeking medical evaluation. Third-degree burns may be caused by a flame, ignited clothing, immersion in hot water, grease scalds,contact with hot objects, or electricity. The tempera-ture and duration of contact are important in determin-ing the extent of tissue destruction. These burns areusually characterized by deep tissue destruction; white,dark brown, mottled, or charred appearance (at first,the burn may resemble a second-degree burn); andcomplete destruction of all layers of the skin. First-aidprocedures for third-degree burns are as follows: 1. Extinguish any smoldering clothing by applying water or by smothering with a fire blanket or anyavailable clothing. Do not attempt to remove clothing. Burnt clothing may be stuck or melted to theaffected area. Do not apply ointments, commercial prepara- tions, grease, or other home remedies; thosesubstances may cause further complicationsand interfere with treatment by the physician. 2. Do not attempt to administer any liquids or medicines orally to unconscious persons. 3. Cover the patient with a blanket.4. If the hands are involved, keep them above the level of the heart. 5. Keep burned feet or legs elevated. (The victim should not be allowed to walk.) 6. Slightly elevate the head of a victim with facial burns. Keep the person under continuous observa-tion for breathing difficulty. If respiratory prob-lems develop, an open airway must be maintained.CC. BurnsChapter 1. Introduction12 D7. Avoid immersing an extensively burned area or applying ice water over it; the cold may intensifythe shock reaction. Cool water may be applied tothe burned area to relieve pain and stop anyfurther burning. Follow with the application of adry, clean dressing or sheet. 8. Obtain medical assistance immediately by follow- ing the serious injury or illness routine providedfor in emergency procedures. Use of a Fire Blanket If a student's clothing catches fire, the student should not run. He or she should stop, drop, and rollon the ground immediately while another studentbrings the fire blanket. Then the burn victim shouldroll up in the blanket to smother the flames. Theblanket should be held close at the neck to force theflames away from the head and hair while the studentis rolling up in the blanket. Water, if available, may beappropriately used with the fire blanket to extinguishthe flames. Do not use a fire extinguisher on a person because serious chemical reactions or frostbite (with the use ofa CO 2 extinguisher) may result from such use. Eye Injuries Immediate first-aid treatment for eye injuries may save the eyesight of an injured student. It is importantto identify the source of chemical injuries to the eye.Exposure of the Eye to Chemicals\u2014Acid Burns Begin first aid for acid burns of the eye as quickly as possible. 1. Thoroughly wash the face, eyelid, and eye with tap water for at least 15 minutes, using the eye-wash or eye/facewash station if possible (seeChapter 7, section D, \"Eyewash Station\"). If thevictim is lying down, turn the head to the side;gently hold the eyelid open and, using the drenchhose, apply water from the inner corner of the eyeoutward. Make sure that the chemical does notwash into the other eye. 2. Cover the eye with a dry, clean protective dressing (do not use cotton) and gently bandage in place. 3. Caution the victim against rubbing the eye.4. Have the victim transported to an ophthalmolo- gist's office or a hospital emergency room forfurther evaluation and treatment. Chemical Burns of the Eye\u2014Alkali Burns Alkali burns of the eye are progressive injuries. An eye that at first appears to have only slight surfaceinjuries may develop deep inflammation and tissuedestruction, and the patient may lose eyesight. 1. Flood the eye thoroughly with water for 15 minutes, using the eyewash or eyewash/facewashstation. If the victim is lying down, turn the headto the side. Gently hold the eyelid open and, usingthe drench hose, apply water from the inner cornerof the eye outward. Make sure the chemical doesnot wash into the other eye. Chapter 2. First Aid13 E2. Cover the eye with a dry, clean protective dressing (do not use cotton) and gently bandage in place. 3. Caution the victim against rubbing the eye.4. Take the victim to an ophthalmologist's office or an emergency room for further evaluation andtreatment. Other Chemicals in the Eye 1. Hold eyelids open; wash eyes immediately, using the eyewash or eyewash/facewash station, andcontinue to wash for at least 15 minutes. Makesure that the chemical does not wash into anunaffected eye. 2. Have someone call the poison control center to ascertain the need for further medical treatment.(See Appendix E for a list of poison controlcenters.) Exposure to Poisons Proper storage and safety precautions, including correct labeling of all containers (see Chapter 5,section F), are effective in preventing poisoning; instructors should follow those procedures. It is important to identify not only the poison but also themode of entry. The danger of poisoning is present,and the teacher must be ready to act immediately. Poison control centers are available to assist in evaluating the potential health risks from an exposureand the need for first aid and further medical manage-ment. (See Appendix E for a list of poison controlcenters.) The poison control center should be given the following information: Age of the victim Name of the poison involved Amount or degree of exposure Time of ingestion or exposure Condition of the victim Any first aid that has been performed The control center staff will provide detailed instructions about additional steps to be taken. If at any time the victim loses consciousness or develops difficulty in breathing, dial 911 to summonemergency medical personnel. Rescue breathing andCPR should be performed, if needed.Inhaled Poisons 1. Carry the victim immediately, if possible (do not let him or her walk), to fresh air. Open all doorsand windows if the victim is too heavy to carry. 2. Loosen clothing.3. Use appropriate mouth-to-nose or mouth-to- mouth rescue breathing or cardiopulmonaryresuscitation (CPR) or both if the victim is notbreathing. Be sure not to inhale the patient'sbreath. Do not stop until the patient breathes orhelp arrives. 4. Have someone else dial 911 on the telephone for emergency medical assistance. 5. See treatment of shock under section G in this chapter. Ingested Poisons 1. Call the poison control center nearest you (see Appendix E), give the staff the necessary informa-tion, and follow the staff's instructions. 2. Be prepared to administer syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting, if required. However, the ipecacshould not be administered unless instructions areprovided by the poison control center or a physi-cian. Never induce vomiting in a stuporous orunconscious person. 3. Take the victim to a doctor or medical facility for further evaluation and treatment if instructed to doso. Take with you the package or container of theingested poison, with the intact label(s), as well asany vomited material. Avoid self-contamination. 4.Note: If there is any delay in the above proce- dures, the patient may be allowed to rinse out hisor her mouth with water. A small quantity of water (2 to 4 ounces [60 to 120 ml]) may be swallowedto relieve any localized irritation in the throat oresophagus. It is no longer considered appropriate to give 8 to 16 ounces (240 to 480 ml) to dilutethe poison in the stomach, unless a stomach tubeis in place and suction (aspiration) is proceeding.Dilution of the poison will sweep the poison outof the stomach (through the pylorus) and beyondthe reach of the emergency-room gastric pump. 5. Notify the parents or guardians and arrange for them to meet the child at the hospital. Poison (Chemicals) on Skin 1. Remove any clothing with chemicals or poison on it and place the clothing in a plastic bag labeledE. Exposure to PoisonsChapter 1. Introduction14 with the name of the injured person. Avoid self- contamination. 2. Wash the skin with large quantities of cool running water. 3. Call the poison control center to determine the need for additional treatment (see Appendix E). Poison Oak Poison oak is common in wooded areas through- out California. The skin rash some people developwhen they come in contact with poison oak sap iscalled allergic contact dermatitis. The first exposure tothe sap may cause an allergic tendency; repeatedexposure may cause skin cells to become sensitized. Itis not necessary to touch the plant to develop a rash;the sap can be carried by clothes, tools, pets, and evenby the smoke from the burning plant. However, noteveryone develops allergies from these plants, andsensitivity varies among individuals. Once the skin is sensitized, a rash develops whenever another contact is made with the sap.Initially, the rash is red and itches. Blistering mayoccur later. If the rash spreads, some sap has remainedon the skin (or reexposure has occurred). The serumfrom existing rashes does not spread the rash. The treatment for exposure to poison oak is as follows: 1. Wash all exposed surfaces with soap and water. 2. Wash all clothes, shoes, belts, bedding, and animals exposed. 3.Do not use calamine lotion over the area. 4. Use wet soaks with tepid water for 20 to 30 minutes every two hours. 5. Use baking soda paste to reduce the itching.6. See your family physician for diagnosis and suggested management. Note: For further information about poisonous plants, see Chapter 7, section F, \"Poisonous Plants.\" Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) This procedure must be administered by someone who has been trained according to the standards of theAmerican National Red Cross or the American HeartAssociation. Basic life support is an emergency first-aid procedure that consists of the recognition of airwayobstruction, respiratory arrest, and cardiac arrest andthe proper application of cardiopulmonary resuscita- tion (CPR). The CPR procedure consists of: 1. Opening an airway and maintaining the open airway 2. Providing artificial ventilation by means of rescue breathing 3. Providing artificial circulation by means of external heart compression FEach science teacher should be familiar with the CPR procedure because experience has shown that astoppage of breathing is seldom isolated from a heartstoppage. Even if normal breathing and heartbeat arenot restored, the injured person can be kept alive bythis procedure until expert medical assistance isavailable. Any condition requiring CPR is a serious medical emergency. During the execution of CPR, another staffmember or responsible individual should be notifyingthe parent and having the nurse send for an ambulanceand paramedics or the police or sheriff. (See thetelephone numbers on page ix in the first tabbeddivider section, \"School District Emergency andSafety Procedures.\") The ambulance/paramedics crewis trained for such emergencies, carrieshospital emergency-room equipment, and oftencommunicates with hospital emergency staff, receivinginstructions as well as providing information so thatthe emergency-room staff are better able to prepare forthe patient's arrival. Chapter 2. First Aid15 G If the patient has vomited, save a sample. Do not give fluids; do not induce vomiting. If an unconscious victim is vomiting, logroll the patient onto his or her side to preventaspiration. During logrolling it is important tostabilize the head and trunk by manual in-lineimmobilization, especially in patients withtrauma or suspected trauma to the head orspinal cord. 7. Fainting or collapse. Treatment of shock consists of these measures: Keep the victim lying down. Cover the victim to minimize further loss of body heat. Use mouth-to-nose or mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing or CPR or both if the victim stopsbreathing.G. Shock Shock Shock from injury is also called traumatic shock. Body functions are depressed, and death may result,even though injuries would not otherwise be fatal.Look for the following symptoms: 1. Pale or bluish skin. In a dark-skinned victim, examine mucous membranes inside the mouth orunder the eyelids. 2. Moist or clammy skin.3. Rapid pulse, often too faint to be felt at the wrist.4. Increased breathing rate; shallow breathing if there is chest or abdominal pain. 5. Weakness. If the weakness is caused by hemor- rhage, the victim may also be restless and anxious.The patient will complain of deep thirst. 6. Retching or vomiting. Note the following:Note: Procedures discussed in this handbook involve potential dangers to persons, animals, and other living things and, therefore, should be performed only by persons who are technically trained and qualified.GENERAL LABORATORY SAFETY PRECAUTIONS 3. G ENERAL L ABORATORYS AFETY P RECAUTIONS3THE LABORATORY SCIENCE INSTRUCTIONAL program should be carefully planned and conducted to ensure maximum safety condi- tions for all personnel. Teachers who have particularconcerns about safety conditions related to facilities,equipment, supplies, curriculum, classroom occupantload, and so forth should notify their school-siteadministrator in writing immediately for assistance in relieving the condition. The following list identifies safety practices and regulations common to all school science laboratories.Additional laboratory and safety practices for specificsubject areas and teaching situations are provided insubsequent chapters. 1. Teachers must be fully acquainted with the first- aid procedures, treatment, and regulations pro-vided in Chapter 2 of this publication. 2. Teachers must have a thorough understanding of the potential hazards of all the materials, pro-cesses, and equipment that will be used in theirschool laboratory. 3. Teachers should know the risks involved in using chemicals and should prepare the chemicalsbefore class begins. Neutralizing solutions shouldbe available for dangerous materials used bystudents. 4. Teachers must report any student injury or acci- dent immediately on their school district's acci-dent report form, available in the main office orhealth office of each school. (See the sampleaccident report form included in Appendix D.) 5. Safety in the laboratory should be taught and reinforced throughout the year. The teacher shouldmake notations of each instructional act regardingsafety in the daily lesson plans and maintain arecord (log) for each class to document thespecific topics of safety instruction and the dateson which they were taught. Thorough instructionon necessary safety procedures, including appro-priate disposal of excess or waste chemicals, mustprecede each laboratory activity. (See Appendix Ffor sample classroom safety regulations and asample student science safety contract; seeAppendix G for a sample science laboratorysafety test.) 6. The use of approved eye-protective devices is required of all persons performing science activi-ties involving hazards to the eyes. All persons in dangerous proximity to such laboratory activity(that is, all persons within the laboratory) mustalso wear approved eye-protective devices. (Readcarefully Chapter 7, section hose,\" must be availablein each laboratory/classroom in which chemicalsplashes on eyes, skin, or clothing are possible. 3. G ENERAL LABORATORY SAFETY PRECAUTIONS Teachers and students should be familiar with thelocation and function of the eyewash station. Anemergency shower must be provided in worklocations in which areas of the body may come incontact with corrosive or severely irritatingsubstances. If the emergency eyewash facility andshower are both needed, they must be usable simultaneously by one person. No more than 10seconds must be required for the injured person toreach the eyewash and shower station whenneeded. (See Chapter 7, section D, \"EyewashStation,\" and the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5162 [found in Appendix B].) 8. Science teachers must be aware of the code requirements and other information on eye safety 17 18 discussed in items 6 and 7. Many of the hazardous activities described below are of interest toscience teachers in junior high school and teachersof general science courses in grades nine throughtwelve. The following additional information oneye protection is particularly important to thoseteachers: a. There is potential for injury to eyes when working with hot liquids or solids or withchemicals that are flammable, toxic, corro-sive to living tissues, irritating, stronglysensitizing, or radioactive or that generatepressure through heat, decomposition, orother means. Splash-proof goggles and faceshields must be worn. b. Investigations in geology and earth science frequently involve such activities as hammer-ing, chipping, and grinding rocks, minerals,and metals. When hammering or chipping isbeing done, the use of eye-protective devices,as well as a cloth cover over the rock ormineral to reduce the hazards from flyingparticles, is absolutely necessary. Whengrinding rocks, use a face shield for protec-tion. c.Students must not look directly into the sun, even during complete solar eclipses. Thedanger of retinal burn comes from theinvisible infrared rays, which penetrate lightfilters and instantaneously damage eyes. Theretina is not sensitive to pain; therefore, thevictim might not immediately be aware ofeye damage. Retinal burns are incurable anddestroy the field of fine vision. The victim'sability to read can be lost forever. Note: No homemade eye protection has been approved for use when the sun is beingviewed. Therefore, students may notparticipate in this activity unless images ofthe sun can be projected or can be viewedthrough a commercial telescope with anapproved objective filter. Do not use theviewfinder of any telescope during anactivity that involves viewing the sununless the viewfinder is especially de-signed for that purpose. To avoid eyeinjury that may result from accidentallytripping the mechanism and engaging theviewfinder, place tape on the bracketsupporting the mirror for the finder to hold the bracket in a position to shade themirror. Teachers must closely supervise allactivities in which a telescope is used. Layers of photographic film or welders' masks should not be used to look directlyinto the sun, even during a complete solareclipse. The indirect pinhole method should be used to view the eclipse. A projector forobserving the eclipse can be made withtwo pieces of white cardboard. A pinholeor pencil-point hole in the top piece servesto project and focus the image of theeclipse on the second piece. The size of theimage can be changed by altering thedistance between the two pieces of card-board. d. When using infrared and ultraviolet light sources, observers must shield themselvesfrom a direct view of the light source. 9. Reagent and storage bottles containing chemicals should be properly labeled (including date ofreceipt or preparation) at all times. 5 If the label is lost and the contents are unknown, the substanceshould be regarded as potentially hazardous andmust be chemically categorized by an experiencedwaste specialist before possible treatment andtransport to a proper disposal site. 10. Poisons and dangerous reactants should be made inaccessible to students except during actualusage. Students should be instructed never to tasteor place any substance or object in the mouthexcept as specifically directed by the teacherunder controlled conditions. 11. Suction devices or pumps should be used when pipetting, never the mouth. 12. Chemicals should be stored according to their compatibility group in a single safe and practical storage pattern. Adopt and standardize a plan thatis agreeable to all staff members and use itthroughout the school. The storage compatibility categories shown in Chapter 5, section E, step 7,are suggested for use in all California secondaryschools. Use of more than one storage compatibil-ity system at one site could be dangerous. 5Minimum precautionary labeling standards for injurious substances used in places of employment in California are established in California Code of Regulations, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Article 112: Labeling of Injurious Substances (sections 5225-5228). The labelingstandards that are of special concern to high school science teachers areincluded in Chapter 5, section F, of this handbook.Chapter 3. General Laboratory Safety Precautions19 13. Chemicals should not be stored directly on the floor. This precaution will prevent the contact ofchemicals with water from flooding, mopping, orcondensation and the puddling of liquid contentsof defective or broken containers around adjacentstored chemicals. Large containers should bestored on the lowest shelves to minimize thedanger of breakage or spillage when containersare being removed or replaced. (See Appendix Bfor California Code of Regulations, Title 8, sections 5163 and 5164.) 14. No explosive chemicals should be kept in the school laboratory. See Chapter 5, Table 1, forexamples of common explosive chemicals, whichmust be disposed of only by trained and qualified officials. (Consult Chapter 5, section E, step 2, for more information.) 15. Any known carcinogen must be removed from the science area and disposed of appropriately. (SeeChapter 5, Table 2, \"Extremely Hazardous Chemi-cals for Prompt Disposal.\")Note: Products made of asbestos, once used in the manufacture of heating pads, wire gauze centers,beaker tongs, gloves, and various other products,must be replaced by ceramic-fiber or glass-fiberproducts unless the asbestos fibers are perma-nently bonded in a hard sheet, such as in thecommonly used building material. 16. Food for human consumption should not be stored in refrigerators or cabinets or on shelves used forstoring chemicals or biological materials. Foodshould not be eaten in science laboratories or storage areas because of the danger of ingestingtoxic or corrosive substances. 17. In an experiment or demonstration involving any flammable liquid (such as alcohol), care must betaken that any flame in the room is at an abso-lutely safe distance from the volatile liquid.Vapors may flow along a table or countertop forlong distances to an unseen ignition source, thenblast back. Beware of gas water heaters in or nearscience classrooms or stockrooms. 18. Teachers and students should be familiar with the operation of all fire extinguishers in the labora-tory. The labels on the extinguishers containdirections for their use. 19. Teachers should be familiar with the location of all master controls for utilities, especially themaster valve in each room for the gas outlets.Mark or color-code all services clearly.20. The instructional area should be kept free of spills, broken glass, and unnecessary equipmentand materials. Good housekeeping is essential. 21. Stone crocks or plastic containers should be provided for the disposal of dangerous wastechemicals and solid materials. Three differentwaste receptacles should be provided for(1) broken glass; (2) spent matches; and (3)wastepaper. Arrangements should be made forfurther disposal of the waste chemicals, in accor-dance with the Solid Waste Disposal Act, at anappropriate disposal site for hazardous materials.(See Chapter 5, section E, step 6.) 22. Teachers should avoid unsafe practices by in- structing and cautioning students about the correcttechniques for the following activities: Using a Bunsen burner and other related flame-producing equipment Heating liquids in test tubes, beakers, and crucibles Handling reagent bottles Using polyethylene squeeze bottles Obtaining and handling dry chemicals Filtering Cutting, bending, and fire-polishing glass tubing and rods Using other laboratory materials, as appropri- ate; for example, pipettes 23. When an electrical plug is to be removed from its socket, the plug, not the electrical cord, should bepulled. 24. Laboratories should always be locked when not in use. 25. The custodial staff should be alerted to general hazards they may encounter in science areas andto special situations that arise. 26. Teachers should set an example for the students; for example, wear goggles when students arerequired to do so. Follow all safety regulationsand constantly be alert and remind students ofhazards. Students not adhering to your rulesshould not be allowed to participate until you areassured there will be no further infractions. 27. Periodic use should be made of the \"Safety Checklist for Science Instruction, Preparation, andStorage Areas\" to check classroom and prepara-tion areas (see Appendix H). Safety and energy-savings procedures should be carried out at theend of each school year (see Appendix I).Chapter 3.

The use of drugs and syringe needles must be limited to those uses specifically called for in theinstructional program and to specific projects underclose supervision of the instructor. Keep all drugsand syringe equipment in a safe, locked place. Radioactive materials used in biological research should be properly marked and, when not in use,appropriately secured.Human Blood Sampling 1. The California Code of Regulations, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Section 5193,essentially requires each school district in the stateto prepare a written exposure control plan (ECP)designed to eliminate or minimize the exposure ofall employees to the blood or certain body fluidsof any other person, thus eliminating or minimiz-ing the likelihood of employees being infected bybloodborne pathogens (see Chapter 7, section K;and Appendix B). A similar responsibility toprotect students from such infection is implied. Options to using fresh human blood, though less desirable instructionally, are possible. It may bepossible to acquire, from a local blood bank,blood (types A, B, O, and AB) that has been testedand found free of the hepatitis B virus and thehuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The bloodmay be used either in a teacher demonstration(using the overhead projector) of the commonblood types or in a student laboratory activity.Such use should be performed with all the precau-tions of the school district's ECP because testingfor the pathogens noted above is imperfect. If blood typing or other microscopic analysis of fresh human blood is permitted by the school district and is to be conducted in the classroom,the blood sampling must be done pursuant to thedistrict's ECP. In the absence of more specificprocedures, the blood sampling should be accom-plished as follows: On a voluntary basis Only by those student volunteers who bring a permission note signed by a parent Performed by the volunteer, from herself or himself In a manner consistent with the school's exposure control plan 2. Several days before providing the opportunity for voluntary blood sampling by students, discusswith the students the techniques they will learn.Emphasize that for most students this is a per-fectly safe procedure (except for possible infec-4.

All laws and regulations regarding the use of animals in science instruction should be adhered to. 21BIOHAZARD22 tion from someone else's blood); discuss the risks for hemophiliacs and others. Emphasize also thatthe results of the tests are not to be consideredvalid for diagnostic purposes. Explain to the class that students must not partici- pate in the blood sampling if they have any knownmedical problem, especially any of the followingconditions: Diabetes. Excessive bleeding (characteristic of hemo- philiacs and users of prescribed drugs thatlengthen clotting time, such as Coumadin, ordrugs prescribed for a heart condition). Hepatitis (during the preceding year). If hepatitis B or C is involved, a student maystill be a carrier and could infect otherstudents from contact with blood on tabletops, broken lancets, and so forth. Chronic pyoderma (skin pus areas, recurring boils). Students with this condition wouldlikely have skin contaminated with staphylo-coccus and streptococcus bacteria. Punctur-ing of such contaminated skin could producea new infection site. If the lancet wereaccidentally reused, it could transmit thebacteria to other students. Infection with HIV. The blood can transmit the virus from an infected person to anotherperson if the virus gains entrance into theblood of that other person. Students with any such medical problems do not need to tell the teacher or their classmates; theysimply would not bring to school a note ofpermission from their parents. Thus they need notbe embarrassed about or reveal their medicalproblem. The majority of students who carry hepatitis B or C or HIV are not aware that they are infected. Forthis reason teachers and students should followthe universal safety precautions outlined by theschool district's ECP (see Appendix B, California Code of Regulations, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Section 5193, Bloodborne Patho-gens). 3. The danger of spreading infectious diseases, such as hepatitis or HIV, makes it necessary to employonly sterile techniques, including the use ofgoggles and gloves, if feasible.4. Blood should be drawn only by use of a new, individually packaged sterile lancet. Lancets areto be used one time only, then discarded promptly in a container designated for that purpose by theschool district's ECP. 5. The use of disposable lancets meets the require- ments for this activity. Each lancet should be usedonly once, by and for one person. The unbrokenlancet should be discarded in the containerdesignated for that purpose. 6. If several students in one class period wish voluntarily to draw blood samples for use bythemselves, each student drawing a sample musthave a separate sterile lancet, which is to be usedto make only one puncture. 7. The surface of the finger from which the blood is to be drawn must be rubbed with sterile absorbentcotton dipped in alcohol before puncturing theskin. Use a fresh piece of sterile cotton afterremoving blood to stop the bleeding. 8. After examining the samples, standard steriliza- tion and disinfection procedures must be used.Glassware, devices, or instruments that requiresterilization or disinfection should first be im-mersed in a solution at least (no weaker than) onepart bleach to 10 parts water (1:10), then thor-oughly cleaned before being exposed to a germi-cide; the manufacturer's instruction for use of thegermicide should be followed. 9. The cotton swabs should be processed as regu- lated waste for either (a) vendor pickup, byplacing the waste in individual red bags preparedaccording to the vendor's instructions; or (b)disposal, if an outside vendor is not used, byplacing the waste in containers that are: Closable Constructed to contain all contents and prevent leakage of fluids during handling,storage, transport, or shipping Appropriately labeled and color-coded Closed prior to removal to prevent spillage or protrusion of contents during handling,storage, transport, or shipping 10. The entire activity area should be wiped down with a 1:10 bleach solution following the experi-ment. 11. As usual, washing hands with soap and water after the laboratory activity is mandatory.Chapter 4. Safety in the Biology Laboratory23 B C EDEpithelial Tissue Study 1. Students should exercise great care in obtaining epithelial cells from the inside of the cheek forstudy under the microscope. Only a cotton-tippedswab or the blunt edge of a toothpick should beused. Never use pointed instruments or any part of a scalpel for this purpose. 2. Only student volunteers who bring a permission note signed by a parent would conduct thisexperiment. 3. Precautions and cleanup procedures similar to those used in blood sampling should be followed. Use of Microscopes and Hand Lenses When students have eye infections, they should not be permitted to use school microscopes or handlenses. Experiments with Bacteria and Fungi 1. All bacteria and fungi should be handled as though they were pathogens. Pathogenic bacteriashould not be cultured. Pure cultures of nonpatho- genic microorganisms should be used in experi-ments. When soil or water is used as a source ofbacteria (or fungi), it is important to collectsamples unlikely to be contaminated by humanpathogens. For example, water should be collectedfrom lakes, estuaries, or beaches free of sewage oranimal-waste pollution. (See section E for specialconcerns in studying air and soil cultures of fungiand molds.) 2. Petri dishes passed around the classroom for inspection of cultures should be bound togetherwith transparent tape. Any petri dish that containsfungus should be taped shut. 3. Wire loops used for transferring bacteria cultures should be flamed until the entire wire is red hot before and after each transfer is made. 4. Inoculating loops must be used with care. The film held by a loop may break and cause substan-tial atmospheric contamination. A hot loopinserted into a liquid may cause spattering. Loopsshould be allowed to cool before insertion intoliquids. The procedure may require the use ofmore than one loop so that as one is being used, others are cooling. When a contaminated loop isinserted into a flame for sterilization, an aerosolmay be generated by the boiling and volatilizationof the material before the flame can kill allpathogenic microorganisms. Whenever inoculat-ing loops are being used, avoid any suddenactions that might result in the generation of anaerosol. These precautions are intended for laboratory activities involving any bacteria or fungi. Evennonpathogenic microorganisms can cause diseaseif they enter the body accidentally. This danger isespecially true if the human system is immuno-suppressed because of HIV, intake of drugs, andso forth. 5. To sterilize plates before cleaning or disposal, follow these steps: a. Autoclave the unopened plates in the usual manner. Usually, steaming under pressure of15 pounds per square inch for 15 to 20minutes kills the majority of microbes.However, if you are trying to sterilize soilsamples or large volumes of culture, continuewith the procedure described below. b. Wait one day for any resistant spores to leave the resting stage and begin to grow. c. Sterilize a second time. d. Wait one day. e. Sterilize a third time. f.Note: All resistant spores should by now be killed. The plate may be safely opened forcleaning or discarded in the regular trash. Special Concerns in the Study of Fungi and Molds Whenever agar plates are inoculated with soil or plant material or exposed to the air inside or outside abuilding, there is the strong possibility that fungi(molds) will grow on the surface of the plates andform aerial hyphae. At the tips of these hyphae, chainsof (spores) will form; the conidia are easily dislodged by aircurrents and can be rapidly spread through a roomwhen the lid of the petri dish is removed. People withnormal immune systems are usually not infected whenE. Special Concerns in the Study of Fungi and Molds24 FG Hthey breathe in these spores. However, people with weakened or suppressed immune systems are at risk ofdeveloping a fungal infection should they inhale thespores. Immune systems can be damaged by immuno-suppressant drugs, HIV infections, or other causes.Therefore, it is good practice, once the petri dishes areinoculated, to tape the lids on with two pieces of tape opposite each other and allow manipulations of thefungal growth only in a fume hood in which a currentof air draws the spores out of the room. Fungi are microorganisms that are widespread in soil, dust, and air. Of particular concern is the fungusCoccidioides immitis, which is present in some soils of the southwestern United States. Most people, oninhalation of the spores, develop a mild flu-likerespiratory illness called valley fever, which quicklypasses. Usually, people acquire a lifelong immunity toreinfection. Some unfortunate people become very illand may die, even with medical care. Therefore, it isessential for students working with soil, or the fungi insoil, to be aware of this hazard and not expose them-selves to large amounts of the dust or spores. In areasendemic to valley fever, you should restrict the collec-tion of soil to sites within five miles of the PacificOcean (in the United States) to minimize exposure tospores of the fungus that causes that disease. Soilcontaminated with old chicken, pigeon, or bat drop-pings may contain the spores of the fungus that causeshistoplasmosis. Soil from archeological sites, the landaround old buildings, and animal burrows should beavoided, regardless of the location. Operation of Pressure Cooker for Sterilization 1. Before using the pressure cooker, the teacher should be familiar with the proper directions forits operation. 2. The safety valve should be examined to make sure it is in working order. 3. The gauge pressure should be kept at or below a maximum of 20 pounds per square inch. 4. The pressure should be returned to zero before the cover can be safely removed. 5. The test stopcock should be opened before the clamp can be safely released. 6. An eye-protective device should be used when working with a cooker under pressure.Extraction of Chlorophyll, Using Flammable Solvents 1. An electric heater of the immersion type or a water bath heated by an electric hot plate shouldbe used. 2. An open-flame-heated water bath for heating the alcohol or other solvents should never be used. 3. Flames should be kept away from solvents or vapors. If a solvent ignites in the beaker, cover thebeaker with a glass plate to extinguish the fire. Ifburning solvent is spilled on the table, use eitherthe carbon dioxide (or 2A-10BC dry powder) fogextinguisher or the fire blanket. These devicesshould be kept readily available. Risks in Use of Acrylamide In recent years polyacrylamide gels have been prepared in some school laboratories to achieve theisolation of specific molecules by electrophoretictechniques. Schools are cautioned to cease this prac-tice because acrylamide poses a potentially serioushealth hazard as a neurotoxin. This substance has beenclassified as 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) bythe International Agency for Research on Cancer(IARC) and is included in the California Health andWelfare Agency's list titled \"Chemicals Known to theState to Cause Cancer or Reproductive Toxicity\"(California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 12000). Because there is a serious risk of inhalation exposure during the weighing of acrylamide powderfor the preparation gels, schools from laboratorysupply prepoured gel less healthrisk because the acrylamide has chemically reacted toform a solid gel (letter from the California Departmentof Health Services, July 10, 1992). Once the gel hassolidified and been rinsed, very little of the rawacrylamide remains. Gloves should be worn at alltimes to prevent dermal exposure to any residualacrylamide found on the gels. To avoid the hazardaltogether, schools can purchase prepoured gels madewith acrylamide substitutes. Questions about the proper disposal of polyacryla- mide gels should be directed to your regional office ofthe Department of Toxic Substances Control (seeAppendix K).Chapter 4. Safety in the Biology Laboratory25 I JRisks in Use of Ethidium Bromide Used as a staining agent for gel plates recombi- nant DNA protocols, ethidium bromide has been testedextensively and has been shown to be a potent mu-tagen. Although ethidium bromide has not yet beentested for carcinogenicity, scientists believe thatchemicals that can cause mutations (by altering DNA)should be treated as though they have carcinogenicpotential as well. Therefore, great care must be usedwhen handling ethidium bromide. The highest potential for either respiratory or dermal exposure is during the weighing and prepara-tion of stock solutions. In addition, splashing in theeye or on the skin can occur during the dyeing of gels.Because ethidium bromide presents high risks foranyone, its use should be limited to instructors only.Note that industrial hygienists at the California Depart-ment of Health Services recommend that ethidium bromide not be used in the high school laboratory.However, when its use cannot be avoided, the Depart-ment of Health Services recommends the followinghandling practices: 1. Ethidium bromide powder and stock solutions should be kept in a locked cabinet. 2. Ethidium bromide powder and ethidium bromide solutions should be handled only by the instructor.Preparation of stock solutions and the dyeing andrinsing of gels should be done only by the instruc-tor. The instructor should use the least concen-trated dye solution which still stains effectively. 3. Ethidium bromide powder should be dispensed only in a laboratory that is not subject to draftscreated by doors, windows, and laboratory crosstraffic. Transfer of the powder should be donewithin a fume hood over a disposable workingsurface or over a tray that can be decontaminatedif spillage occurs. To minimize contact withethidium bromide, the instructor should weighportions in advance, when possible, and storethem for future use. 4. To prevent skin contamination and subsequent dermal absorption or hand-to-mouth exposure, theinstructor should wear tight-fitting, disposable,impermeable gloves. Common surgical latexgloves may offer some protection. A laboratoryjacket or apron should also be worn. 5. Students should not handle dyed gels until the gels have been rinsed thoroughly. Once the dye isfixed and the excess rinsed off, there will be little free ethidium bromide. However, students shouldstill wear latex gloves and handle the gels withcare. Goggles should be worn whenever exposureis likely to occur. 6. Ethidium bromide powder and solutions, dyed gels, and disposable materials contaminated withethidium bromide should be disposed of accordingto applicable hazardous waste disposal regula-tions. The most effective way to control exposure to ethidium bromide is to replace it with a less hazardoussubstance. However, all substitutes must be carefullyresearched to ensure that they are truly less hazardous.Two substances, propidium diiodide and acridineorange, have been suggested as replacements forethidium bromide but have also been found to bemutagens; therefore, they are likely to be just asdangerous. Bromophenol blue and methylene blue areless hazardous substitutes to consider for use instaining. But because stains are specific to particularmolecules, these substances may not be adequate tostain all types of samples. Risks in Use of Formaldehyde Because of growing evidence on the carcinogenic- ity of formaldehyde, schools are urged to cease their use of formaldehyde and formalin (3 percent to 10 percent solutions of formaldehyde) and to arrange forthe immediate proper removal and disposal of allformaldehyde cylinders and formalin solutions. TheNational Toxicology Program (NTP) has rated formal-dehyde as an anticipated carcinogen, which means thatthere is either \"limited evidence\" of its carcinogenicityin humans or \"sufficient evidence\" of its carcinogenic-ity in experimental animals. In addition, the IARC hascategorized formaldehyde in group 2A, which meansthat this agent is \"probably carcinogenic to humans\"because \"there is limited evidence of carcinogenicityin humans and sufficient evidence of carcinogenicityin experimental animals.\" In a list entitled \"ChemicalsKnown to the State to Cause Cancer or ReproductiveToxicity,\" the California Health and Welfare Agencyidentifies formaldehyde as a substance known to causecancer (California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 12000). If formaldehyde is used at the worksite, the employer is mandated by the California LaborJ. Risks in Use of Formaldehyde26 KCode (Section 9020) and the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, to submit a \"Carcinogen 'Report of Use' Form\" (see Appendix O) and to post a copy ofthe report form in a conspicuous place in the area inwhich formaldehyde is used. Many dissection specimens are originally (com- mercially) preserved in formalin, then washed andtransferred to a less hazardous medium; however, thispractice has markedly diminished in recent years. Allsuch specimens should be soaked in water for 24 hoursprior to use and, occasionally, during use, whenresidual formalin is released from the specimen. Thecontaminated rinse water may not be poured down thesink unless you have obtained permission from yourlocal sewage district authority. Schools are advised to use a properly licensed waste transporter to dispose of all preserved displayspecimens immersed in formalin. In the rare case thatthe specimen is irreplaceable, it should be properlytransferred to a less hazardous solution (e.g., propy-lene glycol, ethylene glycol, or ethanol). For dissec-tions of organisms preserved in this manner, adequateventilation is still necessary. All transfers of specimensfrom formalin should take place within an operatingfume hood and proper personal protective equipmentshould be worn to avoid respiratory and dermalexposure. The remaining formalin may not be poured down the sink unless written permission has beenobtained from the local sewage district or administra-tive agency. If there is a formaldehyde spill, all personnel should be promptly evacuated from the immediate areaand the room should be thoroughly ventilated. Cleanupshould be attempted only by properly equipped andtrained spill-control specialists. Regulations in the General Industry Safety Orders (California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5217) establish specific requirements for the monitoring andsafety training of employees exposed to airborneformaldehyde at or above each of the following levels: 1. The action level of 0.5 parts formaldehyde per million parts air (ppm), an eight-hour time-weighted average concentration. Action level isdetermined by measuring the concentration of achemical substance, calculated as an eight-hourtime-weighted average. 2. The permissible exposure level (PEL) of 0.75 ppm formaldehyde, an eight-hour time-weightedaverage concentration. PEL is defined as \"themaximum permitted eight-hour time-weighted average concentration of an airborne contami-nant\" that an employee can be exposed to in oneday. 3. The short-term exposure level (STEL) of 2.0 ppm formaldehyde, which is expressed as a 15-minutetime-weighted average concentration. The STELis not to be exceeded at any time during a work-day. Instruments and Specimens Used in Dissection 1. The use of preserved animal specimens in instruc- tion should be carefully planned to providelearning that cannot otherwise be achieved.Dissection activities should enable students todevelop a greater respect for life. All such activi- ties, particularly those involving the use ofvertebrates (especially mammals), should beundertaken by students only when they areprepared and have the maturity to appreciate fullythe significance of the instructional activity. 2. Students should be instructed in the safe use of dissection instruments. Special care should betaken to avoid cuts or scratches when cleaningscalpels and needles. 3. Specimens should be obtained which, if originally preserved in formalin, have been shipped inalternative, low-toxicity preservatives (see sectionJ, \"Risks in Use of Formaldehyde\"). 4. Preserved specimens should be thoroughly washed (including the abdominal cavities of largespecimens) before being handled by the students.When specimens are being removed from thepreservative solution, rubber gloves should beworn or forceps or tongs should be used, depend-ing on the size of the specimen. Use eye-protec-tive devices to protect against splashes and fumes. 5. Preservative fumes may be irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Adequate ventilation should beprovided whenever preservative fumes arepresent. 6. Approved goggles must be worn during dissec- tions. 7. Preferably, dissection would be carried out only by those students who have obtained a permissionnote signed by a parent.Chapter 4. Safety in the Biology Laboratory27 LM NTeachers will find the following publications helpful in planning and conducting their dissectionactivities: Planning and Managing Dissection Laboratories. Arlington, Va.: National Science Teachers Asso-ciation, 1994. The Responsible Use of Animals in Biology Class- rooms, Including Alternatives to Dissection.Reston, Va.: National Association of BiologyTeachers, 1990. Alternatives to Dissection Students in kindergarten through grade twelve have the right to refrain from participating in activitiesthat they feel would constitute \"harmful and destruc-tive use of animals,\" pursuant to Education Code Section 32255 et seq. When courses require the use oflive or dead animals or parts of animals, students mustbe notified of their rights. A student's objections mustbe substantiated by a note from his or her parent orguardian. The teacher may develop an alternativeeducational project of \"comparable time and effort\" or excuse the student from the project. The pre- and postdissection activities may consti- tute appropriate assignments, which could be pursuedin greater depth as alternative activities for all stu-dents. Alternative activities should be well planned(not punitive) and may include (1) studies of anatomy,using illustrated dissection manuals, study sheets,transparencies, videos, slides, films, or filmstrips; (2)computer simulations; (3) observations of live organ-isms; (4) library research; and (5) art activities, withmodels or charts. Both of the publications recommended in section K suggest alternatives to dissections; the one availablefrom the National Association of Biology Teacherscontains a comprehensive list of resources and litera-ture on the topic. The Animal Protection Institute ofSacramento (1-800-348-7387) and the HumaneEducation Network of Menlo Park (415-854-8921) areincluded among the organizations promoting alterna-tives to animal experimentation in schools. Copies orlists of alternative materials (including costs, asappropriate) may be obtained by calling the telephonenumbers noted above.Handling of Laboratory Animals See Appendix B, Health and Safety Code Section 1650 et seq., \"Humane Care of Animals.\" In addition,the following precautions should be observed: 1. Heavy rubber or leather gloves should be worn when handling live animals. (Be sure the glovesare readily available.) 2. Students and visitors should be cautioned about the dangers of inserting fingers into an occupiedanimal cage. 3. Warning signs, such as Keep hands away, should be posted conspicuously on cages housing animalsthat may bite. 4. Students should be trained to handle rats, mice, guinea pigs, and other animals gently and not toexcite the animals; for example, poking pencils atanimals encourages biting behaviors. Hamstersare not recommended for classroom use becausethey are nocturnal and are more likely to biteduring daylight hours. 5. Poisonous animals should not be brought to or kept at school. Insect-Killing Jars Students need to be familiar with the best ways in which to collect and preserve insects for scienceprojects or for study in the classroom. A safe killing jarcan be made by using any clean, large jar with ascrew-type lid (mayonnaise jars are acceptable). Placea facial tissue in the bottom of the jar to absorb thekilling liquid. Several liquids can be used to providethe lethal fumes, including ethyl acetate or ethylalcohol. (Under no conditions should carbon tetrachlo-ride or potassium cyanide be used in insect-killingjars.) Add the killing liquid to the tissue in the bottomof the jar\u2014about six drops are generally satisfactory.Place a clean tissue on top of the tissue containing theliquid to keep the insects dry. The jar must be labeledproperly and include the following information: DANGER. FLAMMABLE. POISONOUS FUMES. DO NOT BREATHE. To recharge the jar with lethal fumes, simply remove the top tissue and add a few more drops of theN. Insect-Killing Jars28 killing liquid. Add a clean tissue, and the jar is again ready for use. An alternate method of preparing insect-killing jars is as follows: 1. Place 1 inch (2 to 3 cm) of freshly prepared plaster of paris in the bottom of a glass jar (thesmallest size necessary). 2. Pour in enough ethyl acetate to cover the plaster of paris at least 12 hours before use.3. Let stand for 20 minutes; then pour off the excess. Enough ethyl acetate will be absorbed by theplaster of paris to last a week if covers are kept inplace. 4. Use a facial tissue to cover the plaster of paris during use. 5. Label the jar with the information noted above.Chapter 4.

The California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5191, addresses a broad range of requirements foremployers engaged in the laboratory use of hazardous chemicals (see Appendix B). This regulation requiresemployers to develop and implement a written chemi-cal hygiene plan (CHP) that sets forth specific proce-dures for minimizing employees' exposure to hazard-ous chemicals. For assistance in preparing a CHP,contact your county Environmental Health Departmentor obtain a copy of the Model Chemical Hygiene Plan for Kentucky School Districts (see ordering informa- tion in Chapter 7, section J). Under the regulation school districts are required to designate a qualified chemical hygiene officer toprovide technical guidance in the development andimplementation of a CHP that ensures that employees'exposure to hazardous chemicals does not exceed Cal/OSHA standards. The CHP must include the followingelements: (1) safe operating procedures to be followedwhen the laboratory work involves hazardous chemi-cals; (2) criteria for determining and implementingcontrol measures, including engineering controls, theuse of personal protective equipment, and hygienepractices; (3) maintenance of proper labels on hazard-ous substances and of MSDSs received from thevendor; (4) assurance that fume hoods comply withregulations and that all protective equipment functionsproperly; (5) provisions for employee information andtraining; (6) provisions for medical consultations andexaminations; and (7) recordkeeping. Related requirements are included in Education Code Section 49340 et seq. and the California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5194 (see Appendix B). However, a school in full compliance with Section5191, which is outlined above, will also be in compli-ance with these code sections if a safe and practicalchemicals storage plan is implemented, such as theplan suggested in section E of this chapter. Chemistry teachers should be familiar with the safety practices described in this chapter and with allother sections of this handbook pertinent to theirinstructional program. Special attention is directed toChapter 3, \"General Laboratory Safety Precautions\";Appendix H, \"Safety Appendix L,\"Science Laboratory Safety/Liability Checklist.\" Additional useful information can be found in theCalifornia Department of Education publication titledScience Facilities Design for California PublicSchools (especially pages 23-27 and 42-46; Chapter VIII; and appendixes B and C). Laboratory Practices 1. Care must be taken to give proper instructions and to caution students on the use of polyethylenesqueeze bottles and the risk of dropping bottles,especially if the bottles contain flammable liquids.In those cases bottles should not be used near openflames. 2. On inserting glass tubing into a rubber stopper or tubing, observe the following precautions: Never attempt to insert glass tubing that has a jagged edge. Fire-polish the edge, if possible.Otherwise, bevel the edge with a file, wire gauze, or emery cloth. Always aim the glass tubing away from the palm of the hand that holds the stopper orrubber tubing. Use water, soap solution, glycerin, or petro- leum jelly as a lubricant and gently press thetube into the hole with a twisting motion. Expand the rubber stopper by using an appropriate size cork borer prior to insertion.Lubrication is still necessary. Always hold glass tubing as close as possible to the part that is entering the rubber stopper. Lessen the chance of injury from broken tubing by wrapping a cloth around the handor around the tubing at the point of contactwith the hand. Do not grasp a thistle tube by the bowl when inserting the thistle tube into a rubber stop-per. Grasp only by the tubing, as close aspossible to where the glass tubing enters thestopper. 3. Exercise care so that any hose connections be- tween burners and gas outlets are protected frompinching or from being pulled away from theoutlet.5. S AFETY IN THE CHEMISTRY LABORATORY 2930 B C4. Use the stationary or portable fume hood when potentially hazardous vapors or gaseous sub-stances are used or produced in science laboratoryactivities. Whether permanent or portable, fumehoods must: Have an average face velocity of 100 linear feet (30 m) of air per minute, with a mini-mum of 70 linear feet (21 m) per minute atany velometer position. Be placed so that air currents do not draw fumes from hoods into the room. Be provided with a means (such as a light plastic or paper streamer) for continuouslyindicating that air is flowing into the exhaustsystem during the operation of the fumehood. Be provided with a standpipe that extends seven feet (2.1 m) above the roof and islocated so that fumes will not be drawn intowindows or air intakes. Have standpipes constructed of corrosion- resistant materials. Local fire codes must bechecked for standpipe specifications. Fume hoods are never to be used for storage of books, supplies, or chemicals; they are items ofsafety equipment. Air velocity should be checkedwith a velometer or a single piece of tissue paper,which should remain horizontal when held in the opening while the hood is operating. (See Appen-dix B, California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5154.1.) 5. Use the stationary or portable fume hood when- ever noxious or poisonous fumes are produced. 6. Preserve dry ice for short periods of time by wrapping the ice in several layers of newspaper toinsulate it and reduce the rate of sublimation. Theuse of vermiculite, Styrofoam beads, or otherparticulate insulating material and a Styrofoamchest will further extend the preservation of dryice. Dry ice should be handled with great care toavoid contact with the skin and eyes. 7. Handle glass wool and steel wool carefully to avoid getting splinters in the skin or eyes. Students' Safety Precautions 1. Students in the proximity of the experiment should wear goggles. Evacuate students from seats nearthe demonstration table, even if the possibility ofinjury is remote. Injury might occur from thespattering of chemicals, inhalation of fumes, andso forth. 2. Familiarize the students with the potential hazards of the chemical substances included in Table 3,\"Hazardous Chemicals Reference Table.\" 3. Instruct the students to smell the contents of a test tube or other container by waving some of theescaping vapors toward themselves. The containershould never be brought close to the nose. 4. Never cap a bottle or use a solid stopper in a bottle containing dry ice or cryogenic liquids. Alwaysplug loosely with cotton or use a stopper with ahole. 5. Remind students that chemicals should never be tasted, smelled, or touched unless such action isapproved by the instructor and conducted in theproper manner. Teachers' General Safety Precautions 1. Demonstrations involving potentially toxic or explosive substances must be arranged to protectboth students and teachers from danger. Theteacher and students should use goggles, faceChapter 5. Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory 31 Dshields, and safety shields for protection. The size of apparatus and quantities of reagents used indemonstrations should be consistent with safety;for example, whenever potentially hazardousproducts, such as H 2, C12, Br2, I2, P4O10, and CO, may be generated. 2. Water should never be added to concentrated acids. To dilute acids, add the concentrated acid insmall quantities to the water, stirring constantly.Use heat-resistant glassware for this procedure. 3. Table tops should be protected from extreme heat by using insulation under burners or heatedobjects. Do not use asbestos insulation unlessfibers are bonded in a hard material, such as in thefrequently used building boards. Broken orchipped boards should be discarded. 4. Only small quantities of red amorphous phospho- rus should be made available for students' use.When phosphorus burns, it produces toxic phos-phorus pentoxide. are verydifficult to resublimesas white phosphorus. White phosphorus may igniteon contact with air at 30 \u00b0C and should be disposed of by following the guidelines in section E, step 2. 5. After receiving approval from your local air quality regulatory agency, completely burn resi-dues of (red) phosphorus in the fume hood beforedepositing them in the waste jar. 6. Each science teacher should be prepared to act deliberately and intelligently in the event of aclassroom fire. 7. Approved eye-protective devices should be used by all persons performing science activitiesinvolving hazards to the eyes. All persons indangerous proximity must be similarly equipped.Laboratory aprons and rubber or plastic glovesshould be available and should be worn wheneverhazards exist that could damage clothing, injuresomeone, or irritate skin. 8. The safety of students while they are participating in field experiences should be considered anintegral part of the instructional planning activi-ties. 9. Science teachers must be familiar with state, local, and school district regulations on the use ofequipment and materials that produce X rays,microwaves, and alpha, beta, and gamma radia-tion.Chemical Health Hazards Chemical substances can enter the body and, consequently, the bloodstream in three ways\u2014throughingestion, absorption, or inhalation. The following list gives examples of some classes of chemical substances and their effects on the body: Acids: Acetic, chromic, Alcohols: These irritate mucous membranes. Methanol through ingestion or prolongedinhalation. Aldehydes and ketones: Inhalation, absorption, or ingestion of these substances irritates tissues andproduces narcotic effects. Alkalies: Sodium and potassium hydroxides and ammonium hydroxide cause severe tissue burns(especially destructive to eye tissue) and bronchialspasms. Asphyxiants: Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, cyanide, and cyanogen compounds reduce theoxygen-carrying capacity of the blood; stopoxidation in tissues through destruction of en-zymes; and displace atmospheric oxygen. Carbon monoxide: Prolonged exposure renders the hemoglobin of red blood cells ineffective for thetransport of oxygen. Results are toxic and mayprove deadly. Compounds of sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen: These substances corrode the skin and destroy respiratorytissues. Cyanides: Absorption, inhalation, or ingestion of cyanides produces toxic effects. Esters: Exposure causes tissue poisoning and irrita- tion. Ethers: Inhalation produces a powerful narcotic effect. See section I, \"Use and Disposal of Ethers,\"in this chapter. Halogens: Halogens are corrosive; highly irritating to tissues. Hydrocarbons: Inhalation causes irritation and tissue destruction. Prolonged exposure is very danger- ous. Chlorinated varieties form toxic phosgene gas when burned. Irritants: Ammonia, phosphoric halides, hydrogen chloride, respiratory tissues.D. Chemical Health Hazards32 EMercury: The handling of mercury or inhalation of its vapors causes tissue poisoning. Toxic effects arecompounded with prolonged exposure. Metal fumes: The fumes of mercury and zinc poison tissues, causing nausea and fever, even death.Always use a fume hood. Steps for Establishing a Safer Chemicals Storage Area The issues of safe storage and use of chemicals and the supervision of laboratory safety are addressedin several sections of the Education Code and the California Code of Regulations, Title 8 (see excerpts in Appendix B). The following is a summary of some ofthe relevant stipulations in those codes: Each school offering laboratory work is urged to designate a trained member of the professionalstaff as the person \"responsible for the review,updating, and carrying out of the school's adoptedprocedures for laboratory safety\" ( Education Code Section 49341[b]). School districts are encouraged \"to take steps to ensure hazardous materials are properly used andstored\" (Education Code Section 49401.5 [a]). School districts shall have guidelines \"for the regular removal and disposal of all chemicalswhose estimated shelf life has elapsed\" ( Education Code Section 49411[b]). Employers are required to have a written hazard communication program for employees working inlaboratories in which the employees may beexposed to hazardous substances except for thoselaboratories \"under the direct supervision andregular observation of an individual who hasknowledge of the physical hazards, health hazards,and emergency procedures associated with the useof the particular hazardous substances involvedand who conveys this knowledge to employees interms of safe work practices.\" Such excludedlaboratories must also maintain labels and materialsafety data sheets of \"incoming shipments ofhazardous substances and ensure that they arereadily available to laboratory employees\" ( Cali- fornia Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section [b]). Note: Preparation of a written hazard communica- tion program may not be necessary if the school canshow that the required elements of Section 5194 are contained in the school's chemical hygiene plan,prepared pursuant to the California Code of Regula- tions, Title 8, Section 5191. (See the introductory paragraphs of this chapter and the relevant codesections reprinted in Appendix B.) School districts orschool sites should determine the necessity for writingand implementing a written hazard communicationprogram by examining the extensive excerpts from theCalifornia Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5194, cited in Appendix B. The requirements noted above point to the neces- sity of establishing a chemicals storage area that is assafe as possible and developing a plan that will ensurethe continued maintenance of the area in a safe man-ner. Start as soon as possible. Carefully plan each step. The present condition may have existed for some timeand is not likely to deteriorate significantly while youassess your situation and examine your options. Yourplanning and implementation should result in achemicals storage area that has the following charac-teristics: The area is clean and orderly. A telephone is readily available. A current list of emergency telephone numbers is posted. Emergency procedures are up-to-date and posted. An appropriate first-aid kit is available. An appropriate spill kit is available. Safety equipment and supplies (goggles, aprons, face shield, fire blanket, fire extinguisher, eye-wash, spill pillow, and, if appropriate, delugeshower, safety shields, and fume hood) are avail-able and functional. There are no chemicals in storage that have been designated unsafe for school laboratory use (seeTables 1 and 2). Only chemicals that are used are stored (chemicals not needed have been disposed of). Chemicals on hand will be consumed essentially within the next year (except for unlimited-shelf-life items, such as iron filings). Chemicals are arranged for storage in compatible groups. Chemicals are properly labeled and stored in appropriate containers. A material safety data sheet (MSDS) is on file for each chemical that is received in the normal courseChapter 5. Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory33 TABLE 1 Explosive Chemicals (for Immediate Disposal Only by Explosive Technicians) Substance Special Note Benzoyl Peroxide Benzoyl peroxide may be exploded by heat, shock, or friction.Carbon Disulfide The flashpoint (-30 \u00b0C) is well below room temperature, and small amounts of the vapor in air can be explosive. Diisopropyl Ether This chemical becomes dangerous on aging. If its age is unknown or if it has been in (if stored longer than storage for more than 12 months, you should assume that explosive peroxides have12 months) formed. If stored for less than 12 months, it can be disposed of by placing it in the fume hood, removing the cap, and allowing the liquid to evaporate. Ethyl Ether/Diethyl Ether See the notes for diisopropyl ether. (if stored longer than12 months) Nitrogen Triiodide When it is dry, it will explode on being touched, vibrated, or heated slightly; even a puff of air will cause an explosion. May be stored in wet ether. Perchloric Acid Although the 70 percent perchloric acid/water mixture is not explosive by itself, the use of perchloric acid often leads to the formation of perchlorates, which are veryexplosive. Perchloric acid may be set aside in a safe storage area until commercialdisposal is arranged. Phosphorous Phosphorous is packed under water and will ignite spontaneously on contact (white/yellow) with air at 30 \u00b0C. Picric Acid Picric acid should always contain 10 to 20 percent water, and bottles should be disposed of after two years. Dry picric acid is explosive and can be detonated by shockor heat. Bouin's solution contains picric acid. Potassium Metal Potassium metal becomes dangerous with age. It forms explosive peroxides if not stored under kerosene. Sodium Azide Sodium azide is very unstable and explosive. Keep it away from heavy metals.E. Steps for Establishing a Safer Chemicals Storage Area of the school year and is made accessible to teachers and students for review. There is a continual up-to-date inventory of all chemicals, including quantity, location, date ofpurchase, shelf life, and projected disposal date. No chemicals are stored above eye level. No chemicals are stored on the floor. Shelves or cabinets are secured firmly to the walls. Earthquake lips or barriers are in place on storage shelves. Storage cabinets for corrosive chemicals (separate cabinets for acids and for bases) are on site and areappropriately used.A storage cabinet for flammables is on site and is appropriately used. Poisons are secured. The storage area temperature never exceeds 25 \u00b0C (75\u00b0F). The storeroom door is self-closing and is locked. There is adequate ventilation (including a fume hood, if needed), and the area is isolated from therest of the building. Room air is changed at leastfour times per hour. Compressed gas cylinders are secured upright to the wall, with caps in place. Flammable gases are34 separated from oxidizing gases by a one-hour fire wall or at least 25 feet (7.5 m). There are one or more nonreactive waste recep- tacles made of plastic or crockery. The following seven-step procedure is based on the assumption that you have not inventoried yourchemicals storage area and purged it of dangerous andunnecessary chemicals in recent years or that you arestarting with a chemicals storage area that is unfamil-iar to you. However, you already may have accom-plished much of this suggested procedure. Step 1: Assignment of Responsibility forLaboratory Safety Several legal citations indicate that persons knowledgeable about the safe use and storage ofhazardous chemicals should be assigned responsibilityfor laboratory safety at the school district and school-site levels ( California Code of Regulations, Title 8, sections 5191 and 5194; Education Code sections 49341 and 49411; and Health and Safety Code Section 25500 et seq.). Logically, the school-site administratorwould have the responsibility for assigning such aperson at the school-site level. The school-site admin-istrator should carefully seek out and assign the staffperson who has the greatest knowledge of and exper-tise in laboratory safety, giving special considerationto a person with knowledge of chemical processes andhazardous materials management. Step 2: Inventory and Removal of Explosives It is prudent to identify and dispose of any explo- sives that may be present to eliminate the most acutelydangerous materials. Then it is possible to proceedwith subsequent steps in relative safety. Note: During your initial inventory, if any of the chemicals listed in Table 1 are found in the area, thecontainers should not be touched or moved by anyone other than a trained county sheriff or police bombsquad or other qualified official. If any explosive chemicals are present, call the appropriate district staffperson or the local fire or sheriff's department. Caution: The list in Table 1 is not a comprehen- sive list of all possible explosive chemicals. It is a listof chemicals that have, in the past, been recommendedfor use by various laboratory manuals and curriculumguides and, therefore, are most likely to be present inthe school laboratory. Be alert for other explosives asyou search for the ones noted in Table 1. For methodsof disposal, consult Code of Federal Regulations , Title49, for the specific hazard class for each explosive found. Once the explosives have been removed, it is appropriate to make preparation for the storage andtransportation of hazardous materials. Some of thefollowing steps can and should be done simulta-neously. Step 3: Chemicals Inventory 1.Purpose of the inventory. The inventory will enable you to: a. Meet the requirements of Health and Safety Code, Chapter 6.95, which requires that an annual inventory be submitted to an adminis-tering agency (probably the county depart-ment of health services). In many instancesthe local fire department or designated city orcounty agency also requests such an inven-tory. b. Learn of any extremely hazardous chemicals (acutely toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic, etc.)that should be disposed of immediately. Seestep 6 for instructions for disposal of ex-tremely hazardous (waste) chemicals. (Seerelevant legal citations in Appendix B.) c. Assess which chemicals are not used and should be disposed of. d. Provide a cursory check of whether the chemicals have deteriorated and are nolonger usable. (Most chemicals are affectedvery little by age; however, some oxidize,others either collect or lose moisture, and stillothers become more hazardous.) Loose orrusted caps may provide a basis for a closerlook. e. Relabel items when labels become obscure. Identify any chemicals whose labels aremissing. All hazardous chemical waste mustbe identified before disposal. Although all the preceding purposes are important and must be dealt with, it is best to complete theinventory first and then carry out the steps for thecollection, storage, and disposal of waste. Finish byreshelving the chemicals in compatible groups. 2.Preparation for the inventory. Follow the precau- tions described below: a. Use at least two persons (no students), for safety purposes, to perform the inventory.Chapter 5. Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory35 b. Allow sufficient uninterrupted time to complete the task. c. Be sure a telephone or other reliable means of communication is available. d. Wear proper protection (including goggles, apron, and gloves) for the task. e. Have safety items (e.g., fire extinguisher, eyewash, spill kit, fume hood, fire blanket,and half-mask respirator) available. f. Have a flashlight and ladder available, if necessary. g. Be sure the room is properly ventilated.h. Have a plastic broom, plastic dustpan, and plastic receptacle available for cleanup. i. Be prepared to encounter unknown sub- stances. j. Have alternate containers (bottles, cans, resealable plastic bags) available in case youdiscover a broken container. k. Have replacement caps available. l. Use a method of recording the inventory that will allow you perpetually to maintain theinventory. m. Notify school and fire authorities and mainte- nance personnel of the inventory undertak-ing. n. Plan how you will record the chemicals on a substance-by-substance basis. 3.Methods of recording inventory. Some suggestions are as follows: a. Use a small pocket tape recorder and read into it the chemical name, the concentrationor purity, the type of container, the size of thecontainer, and the approximate amount ofchemical in the container (e.g., \"Ferric oxide,practical, in a 500-gram plastic container,about one-third full\"). If you expect a clerkor someone not familiar with chemicals totranscribe the list, you might want to spellthe name of each substance. b. Use a computer software chemical inventory system that contains such features as print-outs for all chemicals used in the laboratory,with their related hazard class; the location ofthe chemical in the laboratory; the minimumdesirable amount to be maintained; and theamount available at the site. c. Start alphabetically. Write the name, type of container, and quantity of each chemical instorage; leave spaces to add hazard class, future storage, disposal information, and soforth. (See Appendix M for a sample chemi-cal inventory.) Step 4: Collection of Laboratory Residuesand Waste 1.Solids. Use the following procedures: Solid residues should be collected in stone crocks or plastic containers, not in a waste-basket. A separate container (with a hazardous waste label) should be provided for any flammablesolid waste substance. Solid residues should not be put in sinks or toilets. Plumbing problems can be avoidedby providing a screen or strainer for the drainin each sink. 2.Liquids. Observe the following precautions: Pour flammable liquids into a safety can labeled hazardous waste. Never flush flammable liquids into the plumbing system. Dangerous explosionsmight result from an accumulation of vapors. Step 5: Temporary Storage and EventualTransportation of Hazardous Waste One can assume that any secondary school has chemicals that are included in the Cal/OSHA director's\"Hazardous Substances List\" ( California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 339, and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 66261.126). These chemicals are found not only in the science departmentbut also in the art department, industrial arts depart-ment, and custodial office. Your site generates hazard-ous waste, and school officials must be prepared tostore and dispose of the waste appropriately. Hazardous waste treatment and disposal practices. Hazardous waste may not be disposed of in the regulartrash or on the surface of the ground. In addition, itmay not be dumped into the sewer system (sink ortoilet) unless you have an industrial waste dischargepermit from your sewer agency. If you wish to dispose of, treat, or recycle your hazardous waste to render it less hazardous or nonhaz-ardous at your business location, you must obtain aHazardous Waste Facility permit from your regionaloffice of the Department of Toxic Substances ControlE. Steps for Establishing a Safer Chemicals Storage Area36 (see Appendix K and Health and Safety Code Section 25143.2). To determine the kind and quantity of nonhazard- ous chemicals (waste) that may legally be flusheddown sink drains, school officials should consult withtheir county health department and regional waterquality control board and obtain approval from thelocal publicly owned treatment facility. If the schoolsite is serviced by on-site sewage disposal fields, theremay be severe limitations on what may be flusheddown the drain. Check with the local department ofhealth services for advice. In any case it will probably be necessary to store some hazardous waste on site temporarily and have acommercial hazardous waste transporter dispose of it.These storage and disposal processes are likely to becoordinated and enforced by your county departmentof health services, which you should contact forassistance, advice, and specific procedures. Storage of hazardous waste. Waste storage prac- tices are designed to minimize the seriousness of ahazardous waste accident, should one occur. Althoughmost science departments do not generate more than100 kilograms (220 pounds) of hazardous waste or 1kilogram (2.2 pounds) of extremely hazardous wasteduring any calendar month, a school campus mightcollectively generate those amounts, considering thewaste generated by industrial arts, auto shop, and otheron-campus maintenance activities. Therefore, schoolsshould be aware that there is a 90-day storage limita-tion for hazardous waste when a site has accumulatedthe quantities noted above ( Health and Safety Code Section 25123.3b and California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 66262.34). Storage practices must include the following: Store hazardous waste in sturdy, nonleaking containers (storage drums) with close-fitting lids,which must be kept closed when waste is not beingadded or removed. (Contact the appropriate schooldistrict official or consult the yellow pages of thetelephone directory for sources of proper contain-ers.) Handle the waste in containers and in a way that minimizes the possibility of spills and escape ofwaste into the environment. For example, wastechemicals should remain in their shelf containerwhen placed in storage drums; the chemicalsthemselves should be segregated for separatehandling and disposal. Label the containers accurately with waterproof labels. Labels must specify the words Hazardous Waste, the composition and physical state of the waste, the hazardous properties of the waste(e.g., flammable, reactive), and the name andaddress of the generator. Include on each container the date on which the period of accumulation began. Inspect the storage area weekly for deteriorating or leaking containers ( California Code of Regulations, Title 22, sections 66265.170-66265.174). Store the drums no less than 15 meters (50 feet) from property lines if the waste is ignitable orreactive (California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 66265.176). Transportation of hazardous materials or waste. The Health and Safety Code Section 25163(c) (see Appendix B) states that a person hauling hazardouswaste to a permitted hazardous waste facility inquantities not exceeding five gallons or 50 poundsdoes not need to be registered with the CaliforniaDepartment of Toxic Substances Control as a hazard-ous waste transporter if the person meets all thefollowing conditions: (1) The hazardous wastes are transported in closed containers and packed in a manner that prevents the containers from tipping, spilling, or breaking during thetransporting. (2) Different hazardous waste materials are not mixed within a container during the transporting. (3) If the hazardous waste is extremely hazardous waste or acutely hazardous waste, the extremely hazardouswaste . . . was not generated in the course of anybusiness and is not more than 2.2 pounds. (4) The person transporting the hazardous waste is the producer of that hazardous waste, and the personproduces not more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste in any month. (5) The person transporting the hazardous waste does not accumulate more than a total of 1,000 kilograms of hazardous waste on site at any one time. Although passenger vehicles generally are exempt from the requirements of posting placards and labelingcontainers, trucks are not exempt and must comply with the Department of Transportation's regulations.Anyone transporting hazardous materials should placethe materials as far away from themselves as possible.Care should be taken to separate the chemicals accord-ing to their compatibility. Absorbent packing materialsChapter 5. Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory37 add an extra dimension of safety in case of accidental spills. Other avenues for disposing of hazardous waste are as follows: 1.\"Milkrun operations\" for transporting hazardous waste. Schools generating hazardous waste can greatly reduce their pickup and disposal costs byparticipating in \"milkrun operations\" ( California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 66263.42; see Appendix B). This regulation allows registeredtransporters to commingle waste \"from anynumber of generators.\" Since much of the wastehandled in a milkrun operation is recyclable, thecradle-to-grave liability will be minimized.Schools should be aware of the following: In a milkrun operation the transporter com- pletes both the generator's and transporter'ssections of the \"Uniform Hazardous WasteManifest.\" The generator is responsible for obtaining (from the transporter) a receipt or shippingpaper, which must contain the informationlisted in California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 66263.42(d)(3)(A-I) (see Appen- dix B). The papers must be kept for threeyears. The operator of the treatment, storage, or disposal facility (TSDF) that receives andprocesses the generated waste will send acopy of the \"Uniform Hazardous WasteManifest\" to both the Department of ToxicSubstances Control and the transporter butnot to the generator. The generator must have an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) identificationnumber. This number is needed to removehazardous waste legally from the site and toprocess the \"Uniform Hazardous WasteManifest.\" You can apply for a number bycalling the Department of Toxic SubstancesControl at (916) 324-1781; allow severalweeks for the issuance of your number. 6 Some school districts have one number forthe whole district; in other districts each highschool has a number.Some waste cannot be transported in milkrun operations. If you have questions about whetherspecific substances can be picked up in a milkrun,see California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 66263.42(a)(1-8) in Appendix B orcontact your regional office of the Department ofToxic Substances Control (see Appendix K foryour nearest regional office). For laboratorychemicals that are not transportable on milkruns,the generator is required to use the \"UniformHazardous Waste Manifest\" ( California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 66262.10 et seq.). A sample \"Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest\" andordering information are included in Appendix B. 2.Use of a registered transporter of hazardous waste. Hazardous waste exceeding 50 pounds (22.5 kilograms) or 5 gallons (19 liters) must betransported only by registered hazardous wastetransporters to a state-permitted treatment, storage,or disposal facility. These transporters are regis-tered by the Department of Toxic SubstancesControl. Hazardous waste must be packed andlabeled for transport in accordance with applicableDepartment of Transportation regulations (seeAppendix N). Biennial reports. On March 1 of each even- numbered year, you will be required to submit a reportto the Department of Toxic Substances Control onwaste generated at your site during the previous odd-numbered year. Careful recordkeeping of all theschool-site manifests and receipts will be helpful incompleting the appropriate forms. For the past tworeporting years, generators of less than 1,000 kilo-grams per month (1,200 kg/year) of waste have beenexempt from this process. Contact your regional officeof toxic substances control for more information. Ifyou have an EPA number, you will receive a reportrequest. Once the equipment and details are in place for waste storage and transportation, a complete chemicalsinventory should be made (see step 3). Step 6: Disposal of Waste Note the similarities of these procedures to those for conducting a chemicals inventory (see step 3).Therefore, it is often efficient to do both at the sametime. In preparing waste for disposal, you should follow these procedures:6On applying for an EPA identification number, you will receive a package from the Department of Toxic Substances Control called\"Notification of Hazardous Waste Activity.\" If you need assistance incompleting the package, call (916) 324-1781. Most likely, your school(unless new) already has an EPA number.E. Steps for Establishing a Safer Chemicals Storage Area38 1. Use at least two persons (no students) to perform the procedures and thereby ensure safety. 2. Allow sufficient uninterrupted time to complete the task. 3. Be clothed properly (including goggles, apron, and gloves) for the task. 4. Have safety items (e.g., fire extinguisher, fire blanket, eyewash, spill kit, and fume hood)available. 5. Have a flashlight and ladder available, if neces- sary. 6. Be sure that the room is properly ventilated.7. Have a plastic broom, plastic dustpan, and plastic receptacle available for cleanup. 8. Be prepared to handle unknown substances if they are encountered. 9. Have alternate containers (bottles, cans, resealable plastic bags) available in case you discover abroken container. 10. Have replacement caps available. 11. Notify school authorities and maintenance person- nel of the reshelving to be undertaken. 12. Adapt plastic water bottles for solid residue disposal by cutting off the top of the bottle andpunching small drain holes in the bottom. Placethe container in the sink for the disposal of solids.Only small amounts of nonregulated, nonflam-mable, water-miscible liquids may go down thedrain. Check with your local public works depart-ment or sanitation district (Water Quality ControlDivision) for specified limitations on disposableitems. 13. Dispose of small quantities of nonregulated, nonflammable, water-miscible liquid residues bypouring them down the sink drain and using largeamounts of water to dilute and flush the materialthrough the plumbing system. Do not pour acidsinto a porcelain-lined sink. If corrosive, caustic,poisonous, or other controlled liquids need to bediscarded, consult with the appropriate schooldistrict staff member. 14. Discard nonflammable solid waste and broken glassware in a container separate from the trashcontainer. Either of those kinds of waste sub-stances can present a serious hazard to custodialemployees during collection and disposal. Brokenglassware should be wrapped in heavy paper,taped, and properly labeled DANGER. BROKENGLASS.15. Arrange for emergency communications should a serious problem occur, such as a spill or a fire. 16. Have space available in which to place the materi- als temporarily. 17. Do as much preliminary housekeeping as possible to avoid physical obstacles that could lead toaccidents. 18. Eliminate all sources of ignition.19. Identify and label shelves or cabinet spaces for each category if reshelving. 20. Have the right information and labels to do the job if you plan to label each item by its hazard class. 21. Plan how you will accommodate (or dispose of) the many bottles of solutions prepared and storedduring recent years. Disposal of extremely hazardous chemicals. The most serious potential explosives should have beendisposed of in step 2. However, there are additionalchemicals whose potential hazards outweigh anybenefit they may provide to the instructional program.None of the chemicals shown in the list in Table 2should be stored in schools; if any are present, theyshould be properly disposed of (the hazard class isincluded in the list for disposal purposes). In addition,all schools that use, handle, or store carcinogenicchemicals (whether stored from the past or used atpresent) should be registered with Cal/OSHA (seeAppendix O for a \"Report of Use\" form). Special permits are no longer required for the storage, treatment, transportation, or disposal ofextremely hazardous waste. Such waste is subject tothe same requirements as those for hazardous waste.However, producers and transporters of extremelyhazardous waste are required to notify and to send atax return to the state Board of Equalization each year.An annual fee is to be paid on receipt of a billing fromthe board (see Appendix B, Health and Safety Code sections 25153 and 25205.7[o]). To acquire a reportingform and tax return, write or call the EnvironmentalFees Division, P.O. Box 942879, MIC: 57, Sacra-mento, CA 94279-0001; telephone (916) 322-9534. Disposal of excess and deteriorated chemicals. Once the extremely hazardous chemicals have beendisposed of, an assessment must be made about theremaining inventory to determine which portion willbe used during the next year (or at most, two years).The remainder should be appropriately disposed of.The process of determining which chemicals to keepshould involve all staff members who draw from theChapter 5.

When the decision is made about what to keep, the remaindercan be disposed of by a commercial disposal service(see step 5). Step 7: Storage Patterns A number of safe storage patterns for hazardous chemicals have been developed and used in schools,colleges, and universities. The chemicals are some-times arranged alphabetically and often by compatibil-ity (or incompatibility) of the chemicals. Althoughsome patterns are better than others, none seems to becompletely acceptable without making special provi-sions for certain chemicals that must be isolated forsafety. The common alphabetical shelving pattern mustbe abandoned in favor of one, for example, thatseparates the oxidizers from metals and separates theflammables, the corrosives, and the poisons.A single safe and practical storage compatibility system must be agreed on and used by all site staff. Amix of systems on one site could prove very danger-ous. A system suggested for use in all Californiasecondary schools is described below, with the tenrecommended storage compatibility groups noted inthe accompanying box. In the recommendations thatfollow, special consideration has been given to sepa-rating and isolating chemicals and preventing theircommingling should a serious disaster occur, such as amajor earthquake or fire. This system also considersthe hazard classes established in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49 (Transportation). All storage shelves and cupboards should be fixed rigidly to the walls and be equipped with restraininglips, wires, or other barriers. Storage of chemicalswithin or near the main chemicals storage area shouldbe selected on the basis of described needs (seeChapter 5. Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory Notes on Classification of Carcinogens The carcinogenicity findings depicted in Table 2 were derived by three agencies, each using somewhat differentcriteria with which to classify chemicals. The agenciesand classifications unique to each agency are identifiedbelow: National Toxicology Program (NTP) \"Known\" carcinogen: substance for which there is evidence (from human studies) indicating a causalrelationship between exposure to the substance andhuman cancer \"Anticipated\" carcinogen: substance for which there is limited evidence of its carcinogenicity in humans orsufficient evidence of its carcinogenicity in experi-mental animals International Agency for Research on Cancer(IARC) Group 1: agent that is carcinogenic to humans; used only when there is sufficient evidence of its carcinogenic-ity in humans Group 2A: agent that is probably carcinogenic to humans; used when there is limited evidence of its carcinoge-nicity in humans and sufficient evidence of itscarcinogenicity in experimental animals Group 2B: agent that is possibly carcinogenic to humans; used either when there is limited evidence of itscarcinogenicity in humans but an absence of suffi-cient evidence of such in experimental animals orwhen there is inadequate or nonexistent evidence ofthe agent's carcinogenicity in humans and sufficient evidence of such in experimental animals Group 3: agent that is not classifiable about its carcinoge- nicity in humans (Agents are placed in this groupwhen they do not fall into any other group.) Group 4: agent that is probably not carcinogenic to humans; used when the evidence suggests its lack ofcarcinogenicity in both humans and experimentalanimals California Health and Welfare Agency (California H and W) An X marked in this column denotes a substance whose characteristics match one or more of the followingcriteria: (1) the substance has been shown throughscientifically valid testing to cause cancer or reproductivetoxicity; (2) an authoritative body, such as the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Food and DrugAdministration, IARC, National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH), or NTP, has identified thesubstance as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity; or(3) a state or federal agency has required the substance tobe identified as causing cancer or reproductive toxicity.(See California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 12000, Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, Chemicals Known to the State to Cause Canceror Reproductive Toxicity). If any of the chemicals in Table 2 are found in your school laboratory, they should be removed from thepremises promptly by following the procedures specified inthis handbook.TABLE 2 (Continued)41 highly corrosive chemicals, such as inorganic acids and bases, should be stored in separatecorrosives storage cabinets, which are: Constructed of dense one-inch plywood and contain no uncoated metal hinges or locks(Hinges and locks fabricated from wood or anappropriate plastic material are preferred.) Fabricated to ensure that shelf supports will not corrode and allow shelves to collapse Provided with a recess or pan on the floor that will collect corrosives and not sufferdamage Constructed in compliance with local safety requirements Equipped with self-closing doors, with locks, and painted with an intumescent fire-resistantpaint Marked in large, contrasting letters CORRO- SIVES, ACID, or other appropriate inscrip-tion 3. Flammable liquids should never be stored in open or ordinary metal cabinets. Ordinary metal cabi-nets provide no insulation from heat and willproduce more shrapnel if an explosion occurs.Cabinets approved for flammable liquids shouldbe constructed of dense one-inch plywood with arecess or pan on the floor to collect spills. Thecabinets should be painted with intumescent- orfire-resistant paint; have a self-closing door, apositive latch, and locks; and be clearly marked inlarge contrasting letters FLAMMABLE. KEEPFIRE AWAY! Verify that cabinets are in compli-ance with local safety requirements. 4. Spacing between containers must be adequate to ensure proper air circulation and the safe retrievalof chemicals. Therefore, do not overorder. 5. Extremely hazardous, unlabeled, or unidentifiable chemicals must not be kept in schools. Followrecommended procedures for the disposal ofdangerous, unwanted, or outdated chemicals. 6. Periodic on-site inspections of chemical storage cabinets must be conducted. (See Appendix H,\"Safety Checklist for Science Instruction, Prepara-tion, and Storage Areas.\") 7. An updated inventory list must be maintained for all chemical substances. 8. Bottles containing acids or volatile organic liquids should be kept away from heating pipes or directsunlight to avoid pressure buildup within thestorage vessel.diagram on page 44). The storage locations may be lockable cupboards, under-the-counter cabinets, orespecially constructed (or purchased) cabinets, such asthe cabinets for acids, bases, and flammables. Eachcabinet chosen should be clearly and permanently (orat least semipermanently) marked for its designatedstorage purpose. As much as possible, keep the chemi-cals in any special storage containers used by thesupplier in storing and shipping. Chemicals should be stored only in approved, locked cabinets within designated science storagerooms. Such storage rooms must be well ventilatedand dry and must have adequate protection from directsunlight. Lighting should be adequate. All cabinetsshould be locked when not in use, and the storageroom should be kept locked. The instructor should bethe only person with free access to the storage room.No student should be permitted in the storage roomunless accompanied and supervised by the instructor. E. Steps for Establishing a Safer Chemicals Storage Area Recommendations for the safe storage of chemi- cals are as follows: 1. Chemical substances must be stored in an orderly manner. All substances must be properly labeled,and an efficient retrieval scheme must be availableto locate the chemicals. Alphabetical order is notappropriate except within compatible groups. Instead, refer to the recommended storage compat-ibility categories in the box on page 42. 2. Properly labeled safety containers must be used to store liquids that are highly volatile, potentiallyexplosive, or flammable. Local fire departmentsshould be consulted about minimum quantities forwhich safety containers are required. If possible, 42 F9. Bottled gas cylinders should be secured to a wall or counter to prevent upsetting the cylinders. Therupture or unintentional opening of the releasevalve may cause serious personal injury anddestruction of laboratory facilities, especially if thecylinder is not secured and becomes a projectile. 10. Larger gas cylinders must be kept in the cart provided for their transport. Valves should be inperfect working order. When not in use, eachcylinder must be secured against movement; thatis, each must be held by a sturdy chain or strapconnected to ring bolts that will not pull free. Thecylinders must be located within an approvedstorage area. Move large gas cylinders only whenChemical Storage Compatibility Categories regulator valves have been removed and safetycovers have been installed. A relatively safe and practical pattern for storage of chemicals is one that has separate storage provi-sions for different categories of chemicals (see dia-gram on page 44). Labeling of Chemical Reagents Whenever feasible, store chemicals in the contain- ers in which they were received and retain the vendors'labels. Labels on prepared chemical reagent bottles orChapter 5. Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory 1.Metals. All metals except mercury (see item 8). Phosphorus (red only; white or yellow phospho-rus not recommended for school usage) shouldalso be stored here. Flammable solids should bestored in the flammables cabinet. Location: Keep ammoniumnitrate), percent greater. Location: Keep separate from metals, acids, organic materials,and ammonium nitrate. Preferably, isolateoxidizers from the flammable liquids storagecabinet by a minimum of eight meters (25 feet)or by a one-hour fire wall. 3.Ammonium nitrate. Store in isolation from all other chemicals, especially acids, powderedmetals, flammable liquids, chlorates, nitrites,sulfur, and hydroxide. in a dedicatedcorrosive chemicals storage cabinet that has aninterior constructed entirely of corrosion-resistantmaterials. 5.Acids. Inorganic (except nitric acid) and regu- lated organic acids. Store in a dedicated corrosivechemicals storage cabinet that has an interiorconstructed entirely of corrosion-resistant materials. 6.Nitric acid. Must be stored separately from acetic acid. Store either in an isolated compart-ment in the acids cabinet or in special Styrofoamcontainers available for that purpose fromvendors of chemicals. Fuming nitric acid shouldnever be used. 7.Flammables. Store in a dedicated flammables storage cabinet painted with heat/flame-resistantpaint. Preferably, isolate flammables from alloxidizers by a minimum of eight meters (25 feet)or by a one-hour fire wall. 8.Poisons. Cyanides (no longer recommended for school programs), mercury and mercury com-pounds, nicotine, and other poisons. Location: Use a lockable drawer remote from the acidsstorage cabinet. 9.Compressed gases. Cylinders must be chained or strapped to the wall, with caps on tight.Location: (a) Keep oxidizing gases remote from flammable liquids, metals, and flammable gases;(b) keep flammable gases remote from oxidizersand oxidizing gases by a distance of eight meters(25 feet) or by a one-hour fire wall. 10.Low-hazard chemicals. Many of the salts not otherwise specified (of course, not the nitrates), weak bases, oxides, carbonates, sulfides, dyes,indicators, stains, noncorrosive organic acids,amino acids, sugars, and so forth. Store on openshelves that have earthquake barriers.43 Gcontainers should display the following information (see also Table 3): 1. Generic name of the chemical and its chemical formula 2. Degree of hazard, as designated by the appropriate signal word: DANGER WARNING CAUTION 3. Type of hazard(s), such as the following: Poison Causes burns Flammable Harmful vapors Explosive Toxic Corrosive 4. Date of receipt or preparation 5. Precautionary measures, such as the following instructions on how to avoid injury: Keep away from heat, sparks, or open flame. Avoid contact with eyes, skin, or clothing. Use only with adequate ventilation. 6. Instructions in the event of ingestion, contact, or exposure The example shown here addresses each of the labeling requirements. Proper labels can be obtainedfrom most chemical or safety supply houses.Table 3. Chemicals of dubious value because of associated hazards are marked with a single asterisk.Chemicals marked with a triangle are known by thestate to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. Districtstaff are advised to make their own decisions about theacquisition and use of laboratory chemicals. If anespecially hazardous chemical is deemed essential tothe program, school staff must assume the correspond-ing responsibility to ensure safe storage and use of thechemical. When in doubt, school staff should contactdistrict staff or other appropriate agencies. In Table 3 the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) symbols are provided under the chemicalname where applicable. The diamond-shaped diagram(see example below) gives, at a glance, the inherenthazards of the chemical and the order of severity ofthose hazards under emergency conditions, such asspills, leaks, or fires. The information can be espe-cially useful to firefighters and safety personnel inemergency situations. The diagram is not intended to identify the nonemergency health hazards of chemi-cals.G. Potentially Hazardous Chemicals IN CASE OF CONTACT WITH EYES, FLUSHWITH WATER CONTINUOUSLY FOR 15MINUTES AND GET MEDICAL ATTENTIONIMMEDIATELY. HCl, Hydrochloric Acid WARNING: Causes burns. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Avoid breathing vapor. In case of contact, immediately flush skin or eyes with large amounts of water for at least15 minutes. For eyes, get immediate medicalattention. Potentially Hazardous Chemicals Many potentially hazardous chemicals found in school science laboratories are included in the list inThe diagram identifies the health, flammability, and reactivity hazards of a chemical ( reactivity here refers to the instability and water reactivity of achemical that is likely to explode or burn, not to thecorrosive or reactive nature of a chemical) and indi-cates the order of severity of each hazard by using oneof five numeral gradings, ranging from four (severehazard or extreme danger) to zero (no special hazard).In the diamond-shaped diagram the health hazard is identified on the left, flammability at the top, and reactivity on the right.Flammability Reactivity HealthRed Yellow Blue Magnesium1 20 W44 The bottom space is used primarily to identify unusual reactivity with water. A W with a line through its center, W , indicates a possible hazard in the use of water. Oxidizing chemicals are identified by OXY or OX, and a radiation hazard by this symbol: Colored backgrounds or colored numbers usually supplement the spatial arrangement to identify thehazard categories: blue denotes health; red, flammabil-ity; and yellow, reactivity.

Usually, the wearing of special protective clothingand equipment is required. Examples in thiscategory are hydrogen cyanide and bromine. 3\u2014Materials are extremely hazardous to health. In a hazardous situation persons must wear full protec-tive clothing and breathing apparatus beforeentering areas holding these materials. Examplesin this category are hydrochloric acid and sodiumhydroxide. 2\u2014Materials are hazardous to health, but areas may be entered freely by persons using self-containedChapter 5. Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory45 breathing apparatus. An example in this category is ethyl ether. 1\u2014Materials are only slightly hazardous to health. Self-contained breathing apparatus may be desir-able. An example in this category is acetone. 0\u2014No health hazard is present, beyond that of ordi- nary combustible material. Flammability (red) 4\u2014This number is used for extremely flammable gases; volatile flammable liquids; and materialsthat, in the form of dusts or mists, readily formexplosive mixtures when dispersed in air. Anexample is propane. 3\u2014This category indicates liquids that can be ignited under almost all normal temperature conditions;solids that form coarse dusts; solids in shredded orfibrous form that create flash fires; solids that burnrapidly, usually because they contain their ownoxygen; and any material that ignites spontane-ously at normal temperatures in air. Examples areacetone and methanol. 2\u2014Liquids must be moderately heated before ignition will occur; solids readily give off flammablevapors. An example is kerosene. 1\u2014Materials must be preheated before ignition can occur. Most combustible solids have a flammabil-ity rating of 1. Examples are sulfur and magne-sium ribbon. 0\u2014Materials will not burn. Reactivity (yellow) 4\u2014Materials are readily capable of detonation or explosive decomposition or explosive reaction atnormal temperatures and pressures or are sensitiveto mechanical or localized thermal shock. Anexample is picric acid (dry). 3\u2014Materials are capable of detonation or explosive decomposition or explosive reaction but require astrong initiating source or must be heated underconfinement before initiation. Materials aresensitive to thermal or mechanical shock atelevated temperatures and pressures or reactexplosively with water. An example is ammoniumnitrate. 2\u2014Materials are normally unstable and readily undergo violent chemical change but do notdetonate. Materials can undergo chemical changewith rapid release of energy at normal tempera- tures and pressures and undergo violent chemicalchange at elevated temperatures and pressures.Materials react violently with water or may formpotentially explosive mixtures with water. Ex-amples are sodium peroxide and sodium metal. 1\u2014Materials are normally stable but may become unstable at elevated temperatures and pressures ormay react with water to release some energy,although not violently. Examples are zinc metaland red phosphorous. 0\u2014Materials are normally stable, even under fire- exposure conditions, and are not reactive withwater.

Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory JH ISubstances Containing Asbestos Asbestos-covered wire-gauze heating pads are no longer available commercially and should not be usedin schools. Newer materials, such as ceramic, silica-base, or synthetic fibers, are now used to coat wiregauze and other laboratory heat-resistant equipment.The newer materials generally have better heat-resistant qualities than those of asbestos and are lesssubject to chemical damage. After use, the new materi-als often look like asbestos. Therefore, permanentmarking, such as wires or staples on the edge, isrecommended to identify the material. Asbestos gloves or other soft or crumbly materials should be removed for disposal. Asbestos is a recog- nized carcinogen. Asbestos fibers enter the body byinhalation. Avoid any use of asbestos. Use and Disposal of Ethers The use of ethers for instructional purposes can present a danger to students and school staff members.The most common types of ethers used in high schoolsare petroleum ether and diethyl ether (anestheticether). Petroleum a true ether (and does notproduce peroxides during storage) but is a volatilefraction of petroleum made up of pentanes and hex-anes. Petroleum ether may also be known as ligroin orbenzine. Anesthetic ether that has been stored for several years can form crystalline solids, called ether perox-ides, on the inside lid of the container. Once peroxideshave formed, this diethyl ether is dangerously explo-sive. The following procedures should be closely followed in any use of anesthetic ethers: Ordering Parameters 1. Order only as much diethyl ether as you will use during the school year because exposure to aircauses the formation of peroxides that are explo-sive and sensitive to heat. Small, \"single use\"bottles (25 ml and 50 ml) are available. After use,allow the remainder to evaporate, if appropriate. 2. Order diethyl ether only. Other types of ethers are not to be used in schools. (Petroleum ether is notherewith restricted because it is not a true ether.)Storage and Inventory 1. Date each container when received.2. Use oldest cans first.3. Use the entire can of ether as soon as possible after the seal is broken. 4. Never store ether in a glass container.5. Never store diethyl ether for more than 12 months. 6. Store ether in a cool, dark location.7. Never store ether in a refrigerator, unless the refrigerator is certified explosion proof. 8. Never open a container of ether if the age or condition is uncertain. Any shock or vigorousmotion might cause an explosion. Do not open thecap or stopper because the motion might besufficient to cause an explosion. Use of Ether in the Classroom 1. Use only when no alternative solvent is available.2. Never have an open flame or spark source in a room in which ether is being used. 3. Keep the work area well ventilated.4. Use minimal quantities.5. Remember that ether vapor is heavier than air. The hazardous area is made greater becausevapors spread along the floor. Ether Spills Ventilate and evacuate the area. Disposal of Ether 1. To dispose of any old, rusty, swollen, or suspect container of diethyl ether, immediately call theappropriate school district staff member or yourlocal fire or county sheriff's department (noted onthe inside front cover of this handbook). 2. To dispose of diethyl ether less than 12 months old, place the opened container under a fume hoodor outdoors and allow to evaporate. Standards in the Use of Lead The California Department of Health Services has recommended that lead and lead compounds not be used in the high school laboratory. Overexposure tolead can cause damage to the reproductive systems ofboth men and women. Effects of the damage includestillbirth, miscarriage, and learning disorders in75 Kchildren whose mothers were exposed to lead during pregnancy. Lead also damages the nervous system,kidneys, blood-forming system, and digestive system.(See also Table 3.) If lead must be used in the laboratory, the Cal/ OSHA lead standard must be followed (see California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5216). Some of the main points of the lead standard are as follows: 1. When lead is used, the amount of lead in the air in the work area must be measured at least once. 2. If the levels of lead in the air exceed the action level (an average of 30 micrograms of lead percubic meter of air throughout an eight-hourworkday), the employer must: a. Measure the level of lead in the air every six months. b. Tell employees, in writing, the amount of lead to which they are exposed. c. Establish an exposure reduction program if employees are exposed to more than theaction level for more than 30 days each year. 3. Employee exposure must not exceed the permis- sible exposure limit (PEL) on any day. If em-ployee exposure to lead on a given day is over thePEL (an average of 50 micrograms of lead percubic meter of air throughout an eight-hourworkday), the employer must: a. Measure the level of lead in the air every three months. b. Tell employees, in writing, the results of air monitoring and what will be done to reduceexposures. c. Provide employees with proper respirators until the exposure has been lowered by othercontrols. d. Prohibit eating, drinking, smoking, or applying makeup in areas in which leadlevels are above the PEL. e. Be sure that employees wash hands before eating, drinking, smoking, or applyingmakeup. f. Provide a changing room, lunchroom, and shower facility at no extra cost to employ-ees. 4. If employees are exposed to lead at or above the action level, the employer must offer medicalevaluations at no cost to the employees.The Department of Health Services strongly recommends that instructors replace lead and leadcompounds with less hazardous substances. If lead isgoing to be used, the Department of Health Servicesrecommends the following procedures: Only instructors should be allowed to handle powdered lead and lead compounds. When handling solid lead compounds (other than lead weights) or solutions containing lead, studentsmust wear laboratory coats, gloves, and goggles. The instructor must inform students of the need for strict personal hygiene and adherence to safetyguidelines when using lead. The instructor is responsible for cleaning up any spills. Handling and Cleanup of Mercury Teachers should use the smallest possible quantity of metallic mercury to perform the experiment andkeep the mercury away from heat at all times. Whenmercury is handled, it should be done closely over aglass or plastic tray to facilitate any cleanup that may be necessary. (Drops of mercury that fall some dis- tance to a counter or floor will spatter and spread infinely divided particles.) Take care that mercury is notput into a sink. All spills should be properly noted, inwriting, and carefully cleaned up. Mercury spills must be cleaned up as thoroughly as possible to reduce the long-term presence of mer-cury vapors in the classroom or preparation area.However, note the following precautions: Do not sweep the spill with a broom. (The broom becomes contaminated, and free mercury vapor isproduced.) Do not use a standard vacuum cleaner. (The vacuum cleaner becomes contaminated, and freemercury vapor is produced.) Suggestions for cleaning up mercury spills are as follows: 1. Assess the extent of the spillage. If the spill is minor (e.g., a broken mercury thermometer) andconfined to a small area, clear the area and restrictaccess; provide maximum ventilation; and pro-ceed with the cleanup. If the spill is more exten-sive, clear the room of students; ensure thatK. Handling and Cleanup of Mercury76Chapter 5. Safety in the Chemistry Laboratory ventilation is sufficient before cleaning up. Placing plastic bags over your shoes may beadvisable to avoid extending the mercury con-tamination beyond its original area. 2. Use index cards to push drops of mercury together into pools. Droplets may scatter a considerabledistance and adhere to vertical surfaces as well. 3. Use a medicine dropper with a fine point to pick up the mercury and place it in a plastic bottle.Continue gathering and confining the mercuryuntil all visible droplets have been found. 4. Use zinc metal powder or commercially available mercury \"sponges\" to continue to clean up tinyand hidden droplets. ( Caution: Keep zinc metalpowder dry because it is spontaneously combus- tible when wet and may even explode if confined.See zinc entry in Table 3.) Zinc metal reacts with mercury to form a safe amalgam, which is easierto collect and dispose of than the mercury itself. Mercury indicators (detectors) and mercury cleanup kits, which would be effective for small ormodest spills, are available at relatively low costthrough chemical and safety supply companies.Special attention should be given to larger spills,possibly including the rental of a mercury vacuumcleaner.Note: Procedures discussed in this handbook involve potential dangers to persons, animals, and other living things and, therefore, should be performed only by persons who are technically trained and qualified.SAFETY IN THE PHYSICS LABORATORY 6. S AFETY IN THEP HYSICS L ABORATORY6 A. General Safety Practices 77 B. Electrical Devices and Connectors 78 C. Model Rocket Launchings on School Sites 78 D. Use and Hazards of Lasers 79APHYSICS TEACHERS SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH the following safety practices and all other sections of the handbook pertinent to their instructional program. Special attention should bedirected to Chapter 3, \"General Laboratory SafetyPrecautions\"; Appendix Appendix P, \"Sample Physical Science LaboratoryRegulations.\" General Safety Practices 1. In wiring an electric circuit, make the live plug-in, or turn-on switch connection, the last act inassembling and the first act in disassembling thecircuit. This practice is applicable to all portableelectrical apparatus. All alternating current (AC)circuits above 12 volts should be shielded to avoiddirect contact. 2. When using an electric current, avoid bringing both hands in contact with live sections of thecircuit. If possible, use only one hand at a time inall manipulations involving an electric circuit. 3. Electrical cords and extension cords used in the classroom should be inspected regularly fordefects in insulation or connections. All extensioncords should be the heavy-duty, three-wire,grounded type. Extension cords should never beused to connect electrical equipment permanentlyto the circuit. 4. If electric current is constantly used near any metal object, the object should be permanentlyprotected with an insulating cover to avoidpossible contact. Take care that live wires do notcontact grounded metallic objects. 5. Multiple plugs shall not be used in electrical wall outlets. Semipermanent electrical connectionsshall not be made to wall outlets. Under nocircumstances shall a motor requiring a startingcurrent of more than 20 amps be connected to awall outlet. 6. During the charging of a student-made wet storage cell, keep students away from the finespray that develops. It is harmful when inhaled orallowed to get on the skin or in the eyes.7. Teachers and students should be cautious when handling a lead/acid or similar storage battery. Itis a source of danger in spite of its low voltagebecause of the acid it contains and because of thehigh current that may be drawn from it on a shortcircuit. Storage batteries should be charged onlyin a well-ventilated space. Battery sparks haveenough energy to ignite flammable vapors.Hydrogen gas, which is potentially explosive, isproduced during charging. 8. Induction coils of any type should be clearly marked for low-voltage and high-voltage connec-tions to avoid the possibility of shocks. 9. Instructors and students should be shielded at all times from ultraviolet apparatus and during theuse or production of X rays, microwaves, andlasers. 10. When handling electronic equipment, teachers and students should observe the following precau-tions: Make certain that the current is off before putting hands into a radio or any electronicequipment. Be sure that there is a bleeder (high resis- tance) across the output of a power supply;otherwise, a severe shock from a chargedcondenser may result. Exercise extreme caution in demonstrating, adjusting, or using image tubes of televisionreceivers or cathode-ray oscilloscopes whenthe tubes are removed from their protectivehousing. Such tubes should be removed onlywhen necessary to the experiment. 11. When evacuating a bulb during the density of air experiments, wrap the bulb in a towel to avoidflying glass should the bulb be crushed. Useround-bottom flasks for the experiment; they arestronger than flat-bottom flasks. 12. When using a pressure cooker to demonstrate the variation of boiling points under pressure, be sureto examine the safety valve on the cooker beforeuse to make sure it is in working order. Do notallow the pressure to exceed 20 pounds per squareinch (137.8 kPa). 13. Observe caution in the use of all rotating appara- tus, such as the whirling table, Savart's Wheel,6. S AFETY IN THE PHYSICS LABORATORY 7778Chapter 6. Safety in the Physics Laboratory B Csiren disk, and centrifugal hoops. Make certain the safety nut is securely fastened at all times. Theapparatus should revolve at moderate speeds only. 14. Care should be taken to prevent injuries from the sharp edges on mirrors, prisms, and glass plates.Inspect the items before handing them to studentsand remove sharp edges by grinding them withemery cloth or Carborundum stone or paintingthem with quick-drying enamel. Instruct studentsto report at once any sharp-edged apparatus. 15. The practice of removing thermometers, glass tubing, and so on from rubber stoppers as soon aspossible after use will reduce the likelihood of therubber adhering to the glass. The best ways inwhich to remove a thermometer, rod, or glasstubing that is stuck in a rubber stopper are asfollows: Use a wet cork-borer, just large enough to slip over the tubing, and slowly work thecork-borer through the stopper, thus boringthe stuck tube out of the stopper. Use a single-edge razor blade or razor knife to slit open the rubber stopper surrounding animmobilized thermometer. Electrical Devices and Connectors The use of electricity can present a serious hazard in the classroom or laboratory. Electrical devices usedin the laboratory or classroom should be only thoselisted by Underwriters Laboratory (UL), or equivalent,for 110-volt outlet application or those listed for usewith 6-volt or 12-volt direct current furnished bybatteries. Electrical devices should never be used or placed near any source of water or in an area subject towetting from any source. Exercise special care in theplacement and use of aquariums, particularly whenusing a 110-volt light source. Instructors should caution students that any projects they submit must meet the specificationsnoted above or will not be accepted. Some guidelines for safety in the use of electrical equipment are as follows: 1. Use only those 110-volt devices included in the list by Underwriters Laboratory or equivalent. 2. Use 6-volt or 12-volt direct current for all possible applications.3. Operate electrical devices with dry hands and in a dry location. 4. Be sure the floor is dry. Never stand on metal or any other conducting surface when using electri-cal devices. Ground fault circuit interrupters(GFCIs) should be on electrical outlets near sinks. 5. Never allow yourself to become part of an electri- cal circuit, intentionally or unintentionally. 6. Ensure that power equipment or devices are double-insulated. Or have them safely grounded(three-prong plug) by a competent electrician. 7. Use extreme care with aquariums when they have an electrically operated pump or electrical lightsource. 8. Use extension cords with extreme caution and never allow them to lie across areas of foot traffic. 9. Be sure multiple-outlet bars have fuse protection or some other circuit breaker. In compliance with California Code of Regula- tions, Title 8, Electrical Safety Orders, Section 2395.44, exposed noncurrent-carrying metal parts ofcord- and plug-connected equipment that are likely tobecome energized shall be grounded. This equipmentincludes motor-driven equipment and hand tools, timeclocks, fans, lamps, vacuum cleaners, and similarequipment as well as heating devices that have ex-posed heating elements. Heating appliances that have ametal frame must be grounded. Heating applianceswith Cal-rod types of fully enclosed elements do notrequire grounding. All nonportable electrical devices must be plugged directly into permanent electrical outlets, not intoextension cords. Model Rocket Launchings on School Sites California state fire laws permit the launching of model rockets on school sites provided the followingsafety precautions are followed (see Appendix Q forfurther guidelines): 1. The teacher should use prudent judgment and limit the number of launchings when students arepresent in the audience. 2. Only authorized classes or clubs should engage in this kind of activity on school sites. 3. Application for a special permit may be required by local fire protection agencies. If a permit is79 D. Use and Hazards of Lasers Dissued in the name of the school administrator, it is incumbent also on the instructor to comply withall safety standards. The school administratorshould determine compliance. 4. The length of the rocket must not measure less than 10 inches (25 cm) or more than 15 inches (38cm). 5. Only commercially produced class A or smaller engines are recommended. 6. The minimum size of the launch site for class A or smaller engines should extend to a radius of 100feet (30 m) from the firing position. 7. No fire hazard may be posed by the launch. That means no dry vegetation or forest areas may bewithin the launch radius. 8. No buildings, other structures, roads, or high- voltage electrical lines may be within the launchradius. 9. The firing area should be at the center of the launch radius. In no case should the firing area becloser than 25 feet (8 m) from the boundary of thelaunch site. 10. Teachers should caution their students about the dangers of experimenting with rockets andmissiles, especially the dangers in the preparationand use of noncommercial rockets and propel-lants. Teachers must refrain from the following: Providing chemicals for rockets or missiles or helping students to obtain them Using, or permitting to be used, liquid or solid fuels in the classroom (Such use essen-tially constitutes a controlled explosion.) Permitting the construction of rockets, missiles, or component parts in the classroomor shop Allowing students too close to the firing area Launching anything other than commercially produced rocket engines of known size andpredictable range Use and Hazards of Lasers Lasers are valuable sources of light to use in exciting demonstrations and laboratory experiments inschool. Most school lasers are relatively low powered,with a light emission of less than a thousandth of awatt. These lasers should not be confused with thepowerful lasers intended for burning, cutting, anddrilling. However, science teachers should still beaware of the inherent dangers to personnel in the operation of lasers. Before using lasers in demonstra-tions or in research, orient all involved personnel tothe potential hazards. In general, school demonstrationlasers emit visible light; therefore, students andteachers face hazards typical of visible and near-infrared light. Eye Hazards Possibly the greatest danger in the use of lasers is the accidental penetration of the laser beam into theeye. Relatively low-power beams may burn the retinalarea, producing a blind spot. If the retinal area irradi-ated is the macula, its fovea (area of extremely finevision), or the optic nerve, severe permanent visualdamage may result. Skin Hazards The effects on the skin are basically those of burns. Lighter skin with little melanin pigment isaffected to a lesser degree, but skin with high melanincontent (overall or in spots, such as moles) may beburned severely. Conversely, lighter skin does notprotect deeper-lying tissue from visible and near-infrared irradiation damage as well as darker skindoes. Exposure to ultraviolet irradiation may result in \"sunburn\" and possibly in skin cancer in susceptibleindividuals. CDRH Regulations The Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) of the United States Food and Drug Adminis-tration requires the manufacturers of lasers to classifytheir lasers according to a federally mandated systemand specifies appropriate safety features for each level.Lasers are classified on the basis of emitted beampower. These regulations are detailed in the FederalLaser Product Performance Standard ( Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 1040), and all commercially available lasers built after the implementation of theregulations (August, 1976) must comply with thestandard as it existed on the date of manufacture. Lasers that fall into class I require no warning labels because the CDRH believes that no injury canresult, even from continuous long-term direct exposureto the beams. A class II laser should be identified by a yellow Caution label that contains the warning Do not stare into beam. A class IIIa laser should be identified by a80Chapter 6. Safety in the Physics Laboratory red Danger label that contains the warning Avoid direct eye exposure. In addition to the CDRH label, each laser that is class II or higher should have the following labelplaced near the beam exit: Avoid exposure. Laser light is emitted from this aperture. The CDRH also requires the manufacturers to provide users with the followinginformation: Caution\u2014Use of controls or adjustments or performance of procedures other than those speci-fied herein may result in hazardous light exposure . Laser Precautions Most lasers in use in secondary schools are continuous-wave (cw) helium-neon lasers that emit abeam of red light. Invisible, exotic, or other harmfulradiation is not emitted. These lasers are typically classII or class IIIa lasers. It is important for the teacher tobe aware of the classification of the laser being used. Class II (cw) lasers have a maximum power of 1 mW, a power judged to be eye safe because the naturalblink reflex prevents excessive power absorption in theeye. However, deliberate, direct staring into the beamfor periods longer than one-quarter second may resultin injury. Safety features include warning labels, apilot lamp that glows when the electrical power is on,and a mechanical beam stop that may be used to blockthe beam when the power is on. Class IIIa (cw) lasers that emit visible light have a maximum power of 5 mW, a power that may be toohigh for the blink reflex to provide protection againstinjury. Class IIIa lasers that emit outside the visiblespectrum may be limited to lower power output. Safetyfeatures of the class IIIa laser include the safetyrequirements for the class II laser, a key switch, and aconnector for optional remote control operation. For lasers purchased before August, 1976, the claimed optical power is not a reliable index of theoutput. Tests have shown that such lasers rated at 1mW radiated in the range of 0.19 to 3 mW. Lasers with cw outputs greater than 5 mW, pulsed lasers, and lasers emitting radiation at wavelengthsoutside the visible and near-infrared light presentadditional hazards. Schools using such lasers shouldhave a copy of the American National Standard for the Safe Use of Lasers, ANSI Z136.1-1992, published by Laser Institute of America, 12424 Research Parkway,Suite 130, Orlando, Florida 32826. Even though the power of a laser may be low, the beam should be treated with caution and commonsense. Many laser hazards may be avoided by imple- menting the following measures: 1.Avoid direct viewing of the beam. Instruct students not to look directly into the laser beam or itsbright reflections, just as they should not lookdirectly at the sun or at arc lamps. As a generalpractice do not place any portion of the body inthe path of the beam. These practices becomeincreasingly important as the power of the laserdevice's output increases. Good work practices,developed early, will assist the individual later inworking safely with more hazardous lasers. 2.Know the location of the beam's path and keep it clear of extraneous objects. All optical compo- nents should be fixed in position in relation to thelaser before the beam is propagated to ensure thatthe beam's path does not change in an uncon-trolled manner. Objects with mirrorlike finishes(e.g., plumbing fixtures, personal jewelry, andtools) reflect laser beams in unexpected direc-tions. If possible, such surfaces should be re-moved from the vicinity of the beam's path.Demonstration equipment, such as support rods,bench surfaces, and adjustment tools, should bepainted or treated to produce a dull, nonreflectivesurface. 3.Block the beam when it is not needed. The me- chanical beam stop should be opened to allowbeam emission only when necessary for measure-ments or observations. It should always be closedwhen an optical element is being inserted into thebeam's path or is being relocated. 4.Terminate laser beams. Block off the beam at a point beyond the farthest point of interest. Alllaser beams should be terminated in anonreflective, light-absorbing material. For higherpower lasers (>0.5 W) the material should also benonflammable. 5.Prepare and test demonstrations when no one else is present. Demonstrations should be prepared and tested by the instructor when no one else ispresent. All unwanted reflections should alwaysbe tracked down and eliminated or blocked. 6.Deflect the beam in a vertical plane in complex demonstrations. In normal experimental situations the laser beam's path should be kept in a horizon-tal plane at a level below or above the eye level ofthe instructor and observers. Complex demonstra-tions involving reflection or refraction should be81 D. Use and Hazards of Lasers conducted with the beam's deflection angles contained in a vertical plane to reduce the possi-bility of directing a stray reflection into theaudience. The laser display system should becontained in a box that is open on the side(s) butclosed on the ends, top, and bottom. If the beammust travel a long distance, keep it close to theground or overhead so that it does not crosswalkways at eye level. 7.Affix expanding lenses rigidly to the laser. When the laser is used to illuminate large surfaces, suchas in the viewing of holograms, beam-expanding(diverging) lenses should be fixed rigidly to thelaser. 8.Equip the laser with a key switch. The laser should be equipped with a key switch in theprimary power circuit, rather than with the morecommonly used kind of toggle switch. Keyswitches are available from electronic supplystores for a relatively small charge. An additionalswitch that requires constant pressure is alsodesirable.Although installing a key switch is desirable, aretrofit may void the manufacturer's warranty. Itis advisable to have an electrical technicianperform this operation. 9.Do not leave an operable laser accessible and unattended. The key should be removed and placed in a secure location to prevent unautho-rized use of the laser and possible injuriousexposures. For the same reason, when experi-ments or demonstrations take place in areas thatmight permit access to the beam by individualsnot under the control of the teacher, a responsibleperson should be assigned to stop the beam'semission if such access to the beam appearsimminent. 10.Reduce the optical power of the laser. The optical power used should be reduced to the minimumnecessary to accomplish the objective of theexperiment or demonstration. Neutral densityfilters or colored plastic can be used effectively toreduce radiated optical power. 11.Keep the area well lighted at all times. Good lighting tends to keep the pupil of the eye rela-tively contracted and reduces the amount of light that might impinge on the retina accidentallywhen the laser system is in use. 12.Provide and use adequate eye-protective devices. Protecting the eyes with shatter-resistant gogglesis essential when using some types of lasersystems, but no one kind of goggle offers protec-tion from all wavelengths. Make sure that propergoggles are available and used (see Chapter 7,section C, \"Eye Safety\"). 13.Shield the pump source. Flashlamps or arc lamps are used to transmit energy into the laser materialin solid-state lasers. The high-intensity lightgenerated by those lamps should not be vieweddirectly. The broadband white light of the lamps isnot completely blocked by laser-protectioneyewear. Enclosure of the lamp in an opaquehousing is essential. Electrical Safety with Lasers Helium-neon lasers employ high voltages similar to those employed inside a small television receiver.Capacitors within the power supply retain the poten-tially harmful voltage for some time after the input ofpower has ceased. Flashlamp power supplies typicallyinvolve higher stored energies and higher voltagesthan those involved in the helium-neon lasers. Mainte-nance of these systems, such as changing the lamps,requires direct personal contact with the high-voltageconductors. School personnel must avoid the possibility of electrical shocks from both high-voltage and low-voltage equipment, including storage capacitors andpower supplies, by disconnecting the equipment fromthe primary power source and using proper techniquesfor the removal of stored energy before performingmaintenance or service activities. Each laser should be equipped with a UL-listed line cord and a three-prong grounded plug. Always plug the laser into a grounded outlet. Conductive optical tables must be effectively grounded.Note: Procedures discussed in this handbook involve potential dangers to persons, animals, and other living things and, therefore, should be performed only by persons who are technically trained and qualified.ADDITIONAL SAFETY PRACTICES 7.

Fire Prevention and Control If a serious classroom fire occurs, the teacher should conduct a fast, orderly evacuation of the room.The fire should be reported immediately, and controlmeasures may be taken if the fire is localized and doesnot present imminent danger. Both teacher and stu-dents should know the location of the nearest firealarm, fire blanket, and fire extinguisher. The teachershould know how to use those fire-control devices. When an open flame is used in the classroom, caution students to stay well away from the flame.Never reach across the flame area. If hair or clothingbecomes ignited, douse with water. A fire blanket canbe used to smother the flaming area if water is notimmediately available in sufficient quantity. (See theend of this section for use of a fire blanket.) Do not usea fire extinguisher on a person because it can causeserious chemical burns or frostbite (in the case of aCO 2 extinguisher). In an electrical fire, pull the plug if that can be done without sustaining a burn (the cord might be hot)or becoming a part of the circuit. Do not use waterbecause water is a conductor of electrical current. Many substances and types of chemical reactions involved in science programs present potential firehazards. The teacher must anticipate the possiblecauses of fire and be ready to act swiftly if a fireoccurs despite the preventive measures taken. The most common causes of fire in the science laboratory are (1) failure to understand the nature ofthe supplies or equipment being used; and (2) carelesshandling of supplies or equipment. The following extinguishing procedures are recommended for different kinds of fire, as indicated: 1. Class A fires are fires in wood, paper, fabrics, and other common combustibles. Cool the fire withwater or use a general-purpose dry-chemicalextinguisher (for use with all class A, class B, andclass C fires).2. Class B fires involve gasoline, oil, paint, alcohol, or other volatile flammable liquids. Smother thefire by using carbon dioxide (CO 2), dry-chemical, or foam extinguishers. Aim at the base of theflame with the CO 2 extinguisher and do not hold the nozzle (horn) because of the danger of frost-bite. Foam should be floated over the fire. Expelthe entire contents of the extinguisher. 3. Class C fires are fires in live electrical devices. Use a nonconductive substance to prevent your-self from becoming a part of the electrical circuit.Use a CO 2 or dry-chemical extinguisher. Shut off the electrical power if it is possible to do sowithout sustaining a burn. 4. Class D fires occur with combustibles, such as magnesium, titanium, potassium, sodium, zirco-nium, or other reactive metals. You need a specialextinguishing powder for those fires. Do not useregular dry-chemical extinguishers. Dry sand iseffective on small class D fires. Call the firedepartment and inform them that it is a class Dfire. Never use water or sand that is damp. Multipurpose (2A-10BC) fire extinguishers are mandatory ( California Code of Regulations, Title 19, Section 568 et seq.). The State Fire Marshal requiresthat one extinguisher be provided for every 6,000square feet (540 sq m) of laboratory space and that onebe located not more than 75 feet (22.5 m) from anypoint in the laboratory on the same story or floor. The following items of equipment are recom- mended for use in classroom fires: General-purpose (ABC) dry-chemical fire extin- guisher. Not for use with class D fires. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) fire extinguisher. Not for use with class A or class D fires. Fire blanket for fires involving clothing on persons. The victim should stop, drop, and roll immediatelyon the floor to minimize inhalation of smoke or hotgases. Someone should assist the victim in rollingup in the fire blanket, starting with the upperportion of the body to force flames away from thehead but making sure that the head is free.7. A DDITIONAL SAFETY PRACTICESChapter 7. Additional Safety Practices84 B Use of Animals in the Classroom A science teacher or other adult supervisor should assume primary responsibility for the environmentalconditions under which any study involving liveanimals is conducted. If the school faculty does notinclude persons with training in the proper care oflaboratory animals, the services of such a person on aconsulting basis should be sought. A local veterinarianmay offer this kind of help. All animals used in the classroom must be law- fully acquired in accordance with state and local laws.All mammals used in a classroom should be inoculatedfor rabies, unless they were purchased from a reliablescientific company. All live-animal studies mustcomply with Education Code Section 51540 (see page 85 and Appendix B). The following animals should never be brought into the classroom: wild birds and mammals, snappingturtles, poisonous snakes, and insects that may becarriers of disease. Students should not bring their petsto the classroom unless the activity is carefullyplanned by the teacher and approved by the adminis-trator. Dead animals found by the side of the roadshould never be brought into the classroom becausethey may carry hazardous bacteria or parasites. Before a suitable small animal is allowed in the classroom for observation, plans should be made forthe animal's proper habitat and food. The livingquarters of animals in the classroom must be keptclean, free from contamination, and secure enough toconfine the animals. Plans must be made for the careof classroom animals during weekends and vacationperiods. Animals should be handled properly, according to the particular animal, and only when necessary.Special handling is required if the animal is excited orwhen it is feeding, pregnant, or with its young. (Seealso Chapter 4, section M, \"Handling of LaboratoryAnimals.\") Students should wash their hands after handling turtles, snakes, fish, frogs, toads, and so forth. Makesure that the water from the habitat is disposed ofcarefully. Turtles should be purchased only fromsources that certify that the turtles are free of salmo-nella. Teachers should caution students never to tease the animals or to insert their fingers or objects throughwire mesh cages. Any student who is bitten orscratched by an animal should be sent immediately to the school nurse for appropriate treatment. After a period of animal observation is completed, animals should be returned to their natural environ-ment. (See Caution in the following section.) Humane Care and Treatment of Animals Keeping animals in the classroom can be condu- cive to the development of many learning situations.The humane care and handling of animals is para-mount during such lessons. (See also Chapter 4,section M, \"Handling of Laboratory Animals.\") Arespect for living things should be first in the minds ofboth teacher and student. Respect for life shall beaccorded to all animals that are kept for educationalpurposes. In biological procedures involving living organ- isms, teachers are encouraged to select such species asplants, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, worms, snails,arthropods, or insects, whenever possible. Thesespecies are especially suitable for student workbecause of their wide variety and ready availability inlarge numbers and because of the simplicity of theirmaintenance and of the return of native species to theirnatural environment, or their subsequent disposal, asappropriate. Caution: Release of nonnative and exotic organ- isms may be detrimental to the local environment aswell as illegal. Observations of animals in their naturalhabitat, including the community surrounding theschool, should be encouraged. In mammalian studiesnonhazardous human experiments are often education-ally preferable to those using such species as rats,guinea pigs, or mice. No procedure shall be performed on a vertebrate animal that might cause it pain, suffering, or discom-fort or otherwise interfere with its normal health.Therefore, no surgery shall be performed on any livingvertebrate animal (mammal, bird, fish, reptile, oramphibian). No lesson or experiment shall subject avertebrate animal to any of the following: Microorganisms that can cause disease in humans or animals Ionizing radiation Cancer-producing agents Chemicals at toxic levels Drugs that produce pain or deformity Extremes of temperatures Stressful electric or other shock85 C Excessive noise Noxious fumes Exhausting exercise Overcrowding Other distressing stimuli Animal observations must be directly supervised by a competent science teacher, who shall approve theplan before the student starts work. Students must havethe necessary comprehension and qualifications for thework contemplated. The supervisor shall oversee allexperimental procedures, shall be responsible for theirnonhazardous nature, and shall personally and continu-ally inspect experimental animals during the course ofthe study to ensure that their health and comfort arefully sustained. Vertebrate animal studies shall be conducted only in locations in which proper supervision is available,either a school or an institution of research or highereducation. No vertebrate animal studies shall beconducted at a home (other than observations ofnormal behavior of pet animals, such as dogs or cats). In vertebrate animal studies, animals shall be provided palatable food in sufficient quantity tomaintain normal growth. Diets deficient in essentialfoods are prohibited. Food shall not be withheld forperiods longer than 12 hours. Clean drinking watershall be available at all times (and shall not be re-placed by alcohol or drugs). Chicken eggs subjected to experimental manipula- tions that may produce abnormalities shall not beallowed to hatch. Such embryos shall be killed hu-manely no later than the 18th day of incubation. Ifnormal egg embryos are to be hatched, satisfactoryarrangements must be made for the appropriate care orhumane relocation of chicks. Projects involving vertebrate animals will nor- mally be restricted to measuring and studying normalphysiological functions (such as normal growth,activity cycles, metabolism, blood circulation, learningprocesses, normal behavior, reproduction, and commu-nication) or isolated tissue techniques. None of thesestudies requires infliction of pain. Regulations State and local laws regulate the care and use of animals in both elementary and secondary scienceinstruction. The treatment of animals in Californiapublic school instruction is regulated by Education Code Section 51540 as follows:51540. In the public elementary and high schools or in public elementary and high school school-sponsored activities and classes held elsewhere than onschool premises, live vertebrate animals shall not, aspart of a scientific experiment or any purpose whatever: (a) Be experimentally medicated or drugged in a manner to cause painful reactions or inducepainful or lethal pathological conditions. (b) Be injured through any other treatments, includ- ing, but not limited to, anesthetization or electricshock. Live animals on the premises of a public elemen- tary or high school shall be housed and cared for in ahumane and safe manner. The provisions of this section are not intended to prohibit or constrain vocational instruction in thenormal practices of animal husbandry. Regulations about the use of animals in the classroom for educational purposes are also includedin the Health and Safety Code of the state of Califor- nia. These regulations state that animals used forexperimental, educational purposes must be humanelytreated, supplied with adequate food and water, andkept in satisfactory shelter and sanitary conditions.(See Appendix B for the applicable section of theHealth and Safety Code .) Eye Safety The sections of the Education Code (32030- 32033) that regulate the duties and responsibilities ofschools and school districts to protect the eyes ofstudents, staff, and visitors during hazardous activitiesconducted in the classroom are cited in Appendix B.Those legal requirements are summarized in thissection, followed by information on eye-protectivedevices and other eye-safety practices. Legal Requirements School district governing boards have the duty to equip schools with eye-protective devices for the useof all students, teachers, and visitors participating inhazardous activities, such as those outlined below.Principals or teachers supervising any of those activi-ties must require that the eye-protective devices beworn by participating students, teachers, and visitors. Handbooks, guides, and other instructional materi- als designed for use by persons involved in directsupervision of hazardous situations must carry addi-C. Eye SafetyChapter 7. Additional Safety Practices86 tional, detailed guidelines covering particular subject areas and concerns. Circumstances requiring eye-protective devices. Courses in which the eye-protective devices shall beworn include, but are not limited to, vocational orindustrial arts shops or laboratories and chemistry,physics, or combined chemistry-physics laboratories atany time the individual is engaged in an activity or isobserving the use of hazardous substances likely tocause injury to the eyes. Such activity includes, but isnot limited to, the following: Working with hot metal Working with hot liquids or solids or with chemi- cals that are flammable, toxic, corrosive to livingtissues, irritating, strongly sensitizing, or radioac-tive or that generate pressure through heat, decom-position, or other means Working with materials or equipment under stress, pressure, or force that might cause fragmentation,including the use of hand or power tools with suchhard materials as stone or metal Standards for devices. The eye-protective devices used shall be industrial-quality devices that meet thestandards of the American National Standards Institute(ANSI).Sale of devices. If students and teachers wish to purchase their own eye-protective devices, the devicesmay be sold at a price that shall not exceed the cost ofthe devices to the school district. Eye-Protective Devices Eye-protective devices vary in form and effective- ness. Three basic types of eye and face protection areas follows: Goggles\u2014primarily intended for eye protection against impact and splash. Goggles also serve toreduce the dust and fumes reaching the eye. Face shield\u2014for partial personal face protection against splash or impact. Face shields shouldordinarily be used in conjunction with goggles. Safety shield\u2014for group protection from splash and impact. The safety shield should be used withgoggles and, if appropriate, with a face shield. Specifications for eye-protective devices include the following: (1) lenses must have a minimumthickness of 3 mm and be impact-resistant; (2) framesmust be a lens-retaining type made of nonflammablematerial; and (3) goggles must be splash-proof. SeeTable 4 for further information about recommendedsupplies of eye-safety devices. TABLE 4 Recommended Supplies of Safety Devices for Eyes Device Recommended Allowance 1.Goggles\u2014plastic, splash-proof, vented One class set of 35 for each school science laboratory (standard Z87.1) (This number allows for visitors, breakage, and loss.) 2.Goggles\u2014plastic, splash-proof, nonvented Five for each science laboratory 3.Face shield \u2014quickly adjustable One for each teaching station, preparation room, and project room 4.Cabinet\u2014germicidal, ultraviolet, capacity 35 goggles One for each class set of goggles 5.Safety shield \u2014flat One for two classrooms 6.Safety shield \u2014curved One for two classrooms Note: These eye-protective devices should not be considered 100 percent effective against all potential eye hazards. Appropriate combinations of devices may be used for optimum protection.87 To establish an effective eye-safety program, the teacher must comply with the following practices: 1. Orient the students to the need for and use of eye- protective devices. 2. Warn students that contact lenses may not be worn in an atmosphere that may contain hazardousgases, vapors, or liquids or when there is anydanger of chemicals entering the eye (see accom-panying box, \"Use of Contact Lenses\"). 3. Consider eye safety when planning each science activity. Refer to Chapter 2, sectionD, \"EyeInjuries,\" and the following subsection in thischapter, \"Potential Eye Hazards.\" Ensure that allpersons performing science laboratory activitiesinvolving hazards to the eyes wear approved eye-protective devices. All persons in dangerousproximity to such activities must be similarlyequipped. Use of Contact Lenses The use of contact lenses in science laboratoryinstruction is strongly discouraged because thecapillary action of solutions causes rapid spreadingof the solution under contact lenses and possiblydelays the removal of the lenses. Quick removal ofcontact lenses is very difficult under adverseconditions. When laboratory activities are antici-pated, prescription glasses should be worn unless astudent cannot see without contact lenses. Contactlenses are also not to be worn when a dust or vaporhazard exists unless vapor-resistant goggles areavailable. It is essential to provide approvednonvented protective goggles promptly to students,teachers, and visitors wearing contact lenses and toensure that the goggles are worn regularly. Ifadequate eye protection cannot be provided, thestudent should be excused from the activity andassigned to another supervised room or area.6. Maintain reasonable standards of cleanliness because eye-protective devices will usually beshared by several persons. Use of germicidalcabinets or dips is highly recommended alongwith frequent, thorough washing. Although theseprocedures do not sterilize, they do sanitize,which is safer than no cleaning at all. Studentswith unhealthy, possibly contagious skin or eyeconditions should be encouraged to purchasepersonal safety goggles; or specific gogglesshould be reserved for the students' exclusive use. 7. Consider the special requirements of the store- room, preparation room, and project room activi-ties. Because of the greater probability andseverity of many eye hazards in storerooms,preparation rooms, and project rooms, all personsperforming or observing hazardous activities inthose areas must be equipped with the splash-proof plastic goggles and other approved eye-safety devices specified for those areas. Potential Eye Hazards Eye-protective devices must be provided for participants and observers in activities involving, butnot limited to, the following conditions: 1. Impact hazards Conducting pneumatic pressure or evacuation operations, including use of the pressurecooker Operating power tools Operating centrifugal (centripetal) devices Conducting projectile and collision demon- strations Handling elastic materials under stress; for example, springs, wires, rubber, glass Working with or igniting explosive or implo- sive devices or substances Working with hot molten metals Hammering, chipping, or grinding rocks, minerals, and metals Cutting or breaking glass 2. Hazardous substances Pouring, pumping, or dispensing corrosive substances Generating toxic or potentially explosive gases Mixing chemicals that react violently Preserving and staining biological specimensC. Eye Safety 4. Establish routine procedures for the distribution of the individual eye-protective devices, whenneeded, and for their subsequent return to thestorage case. 5. Establish a definite, readily accessible location in the designated areas for each type of eye-protec-tive device. An accessible germicidal ultravioletstorage cabinet is an appropriate location forgoggles because it serves the dual purpose ofstoring and sterilizing the goggles.Chapter 7. Additional Safety Practices88 DE Cleaning and sterilizing with corrosive substances, including ammonia, detergents, orsolvents 3. Hazardous radiation Direct viewing of the sun ( Note: No approved eye protection is provided. Do not allow this activity.) Use of infrared and ultraviolet light sources (Note: No approved eye protection is pro- vided. These sources must be shielded fromdirect view.) Use of lasers ( Note: No approved eye protec- tion is provided. These sources must beshielded from direct view. See Chapter 6,section D, \"Use and Hazards of Lasers.\") An effective eye-protection program must include adequate instruction and demonstration on the hazardsof laboratory work and the methods with which toavert accidental injury. This instruction must berepetitious and should become routine procedure. Theeye-protective devices must be readily availablewhenever needed, and high standards of cleanlinessmust be maintained to prevent any spread of infectionfrom contagious eye or skin conditions. Students mustbe cautioned never to rub their eyes or touch theirfaces during any activity using reagents or substancesthat could be transferred through their hands. Studentsshould scrub their hands thoroughly after any suchlaboratory exercise. Eyewash Station An eyewash station should be provided in any classroom or stockroom in which a chemical splashinto eyes is a possibility ( California Code of Regula- tions, Title 8, General Industry Safety Orders, Section 5162; see Appendix B). Several types of stations arepossible, including: A completely plumbed-in or self-contained station A faucet-mount eyewash or eyewash/facewash unit that attaches directly to an existing faucet and alsoallows for normal faucet usage A face-and-shower-head drench hose, operated by a squeeze handle, may support plumbed or self-contained units but may not be used in lieu of them(unless specially designed with separate flushingsprays for each eye). The shower head should be on a hose that pulls out of the counter and is installed nextto an existing sink, over which the face can be held asthe eyes are washed. Safety on Field Trips Field trips afford unique learning opportunities and often include hazards not encountered in theclassroom/laboratory. They should be carefullyplanned and should include provisions for transporta-tion, protection against on-site hazards, and supervi-sion (see NSTA position statement in Appendix A).The teacher should visit the site beforehand to assessthe hazards so that they can be considered in thepretrip orientation and in communications with parentsor guardians. Permission slips should be completed and signed by parents or guardians (see sample form in AppendixR). The document should include details of the trip andprovide an opportunity for parents or guardians toindicate any reason (medical, psychological, orreligious) for their children to be exempted from theactivity or be given special consideration during theactivity because of conditions resulting from medica-tion, allergies, and so forth. 89 FThe nature of the field trip activity and the envi- ronment will dictate supervision needs. Ordinarily,there should be a minimum of one adult per tenstudents unless district policy indicates otherwise. A first-aid kit (see Appendix D) is required whenever a group takes a trip away from school. If thefield trip is conducted in an area known to be infestedby poisonous snakes, be aware of the precautionsabout poisonous snakebites described in Chapter 2 ofthis handbook. After a first-aid kit is used, the contentsshould be replenished if necessary. Students should be informed about the most appropriate kinds of clothing to wear on particularfield trips. Students should be instructed to wash theirhands and faces with a strong soap immediately afterany exposure to hazards, such as poisonous plants, inthe environment (see the following section of thischapter). Special precautions should be taken when trips are conducted on or near deep water. Special precautionsshould also be taken when trips are conducted in areasin which participants are likely to come into contactwith animals or organisms that spread diseases, suchas the Hanta virus, Lyme disease (spirochete), andvalley fever (coccidioidomycosis). The Hanta virus is spread by rodents in the natural regions and is found especially around and in primi-tive, abandoned, or seasonally used buildings inCalifornia and other states. The virus is often inhaledwith the dust in which saliva, urine, or feces fromrodents have intermingled. Special decontaminationmeasures should be taken when participants come intocontact with owl pellets because of the possibleconsumption by the owls of infected rodents. Consultyour county environmental health department fordecontamination procedures. Lyme disease is more prevalent along the north coastal region of California. The spirochete thatcauses the infection is injected during the bite ofcertain ticks and may also be transmitted to othermammals (including pets) and birds. Arthritis, heartproblems, and nervous disorders may result from thedisease, which is characterized in its early stages as askin rash that is hard at its center. Students should takespecial precautions, such as wearing protective cloth-ing and checking the clothes and body frequently forticks. Students should shower as soon as they returnhome and carefully check for ticks again at that time.Valley fever, or coccidioidomycosis, is discussed in detail in Chapter 4, section E, and in Appendix S. Poisonous Plants Biology and general science teachers should be prepared to warn students about the dangers of poison-ous plants that grow in California. Special attentionshould be given to poisonous plants or plants withpoisonous parts that are (1) included in the schoollandscaping; (2) brought to school for plant studies; or(3) likely to grow in areas in which field trips areplanned. Teachers are encouraged to become ac-quainted with and teach about poisonous plantsgrowing around homes, parks, streets, and recreationalareas in the school district. Because not all plants have been thoroughly researched for their toxicity, a commonsense rulewould be never to do any of the following: Never place any plant part in the mouth. Never rub any sap or fruit juice into the skin or an open wound. Never inhale or expose the skin or eyes to the smoke of any burning plant or plant parts. Never pick strange wildflowers or cultivated plants that are unknown. Never eat food after handling plants without first scrubbing the hands. The reason for these never precautions is that any part of a plant can be relatively toxic, even fatal,depending on the weight of the person and the amountof the plant ingested. See Table 5 for further informa-tion about some poisonous plants. Students frequently place seeds in their mouths unconsciously. The danger in this habit lies in thepossibility not only of swallowing a poisonous speciesbut also of falling prey to the practice of commercialdistributors who coat their garden and crop seeds withhormones, fungicides, and insecticides. Some of thoseitems cause allergic skin responses. The remainder areusually deadly when inhaled to any degree or acciden-tally ingested. Teachers purchasing seeds for experi-ments from dealers should investigate the presence ofany such coating or sprays and ask the dealer whetherthe seeds have been chemically coated.F.

Additional Safety Practices94 G Ionizing Radiation Before considering the acquisition of radiation- producing machines or radioactive materials, schooladministrators and science department faculty shouldobtain a copy of the California Radiation ControlRegulations (California Code of Regulations, Title 17). The manual is available from the California Depart-ment of Health Services, Radiologic Health Branch,P.O. Box 1525, Sacramento, CA 95807. It providesregulatory, licensing, and safety requirements for theuse of radiation-producing machines and radioactivematerials. When planning to use radiation-producing ma- chines or radioactive materials in the classroom,teaching and administrative staff should be fully awareof the recommendations of the National Committee onRadiation Protection and Measurements and of therequirements of California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 30265, that limit radiation exposure of persons under eighteen years of age to no more than0.5 rem per year. Although the risk of reaching orexceeding that limit is exceedingly small, all usesshould be planned and conducted accordingly. Schools should not accept gifts of X-ray machines or radioactive materials until (1) the machines havebeen checked by a qualified health physicist or radio-logical physicist to determine that the equipment canbe operated safely and without excessive radiationleakage; and (2) the radioactive materials have beendetermined not to exceed permissible quantity limitsspecified by California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 30180(c), and have been found to be free ofremovable contamination in excess of 0.005 microcu-rie. Radiation Machines A radiation machine is any device capable of producing ionizing radiation when the associatedcontrol devices are operated. Examples of radiation-producing machines are medical and dental machinesused in the healing arts, electron microscopes, cabinetX-ray machines, and fluoroscopes. Registration. Every person who acquires a radia- tion-producing machine shall register it with theDepartment of Health Services (DOHS) within 30days. Registration forms can be obtained from DOHS,Radiologic Health Branch, P.O. Box 1525, Sacra-mento, CA 95807; telephone (916) 445-6256. Exemptions. Electrical equipment is exempt from registration if it produces radiation incidental to itsoperation but does not produce radiation in any accessible area to such a degree that an individualwill be likely to receive a radiation dose to the wholebody or to the head, trunk, gonads, lens of the eye,or active blood-forming organs in excess of 0.5 remin a year. Examples of potentially hazardous equip-ment are flyback transformers, shunt regulator tubes,and cathode-ray excessof 20,000 volts. Cold Cathode-Ray Tubes Cold cathode-ray tubes of the types commonly used in the classroom have been identified aspotential sources of hazardous X rays coincidental tothe intended use of the tubes. The information in thissection on cold cathode-ray tubes was provided bythe California Department of Public Health inBerkeley as a guide for science teachers. Cold cathode-ray tubes are used for the study of electrons and electronic phenomena. The tubes comein a multitude of sizes, shapes, and forms. Threekinds of cold cathode-ray tubes that can producepotentially hazardous X rays coincidental to theirintended use are heat-effect tubes, magnetic-effecttubes, and shadow- or fluorescence-effect tubes.These cathode-ray tubes can produce X rays whenall the following conditions are met: An electron source or cathode is present. There is a target or anode that the electrons can strike. A high potential difference exists between anode and cathode. (In voltage of 10KV or under, theelectrons do not acquire sufficient energy toproduce significant X rays.) Low gas pressure prevails between cathode and anode; that is, a moderately good vacuum existsin the tube. The heat-effect tube is used to demonstrate that cathode rays consist of rapidly moving electronswhose kinetic energy is converted to heat on colli-sion with an object. The tube consists of an evacu-ated glass bulb with a thin foil target positionedbetween opposed electrodes. The cathode has aconcave surface to focus electrons on a small spot ofthe foil. The focal spot on the foil can easily beheated to a dramatically visible white heat. The magnetic- or deflection-effect tube demon- strates that cathode rays carry an electric charge andcan be deflected by a magnetic field. This tubeconsists of an evacuated glass cylinder with an95 electrode at each end. An aluminum strip coated with a fluorescent material is positioned between the elec-trodes, and a collimating slit is at the cathode end. In amagnetic field the luminous line caused by electronbombardment of the fluorescent strip moves up ordown according to the polarity of the magnet. The shadow- or fluorescence-effect tube demon- strates that cathode-ray energy may be converted intovisible radiation by fluorescence of the glass walls ofthe tube, resulting from electron bombardment. Ametallic object, such as a Maltese cross, is placed in aCrookes tube so that its shadow can be cast on theglass wall of the tube. By observing this shadow, onecan see that the cathode rays producing this patterntravel in straight lines. The following conclusions may be drawn about X- ray production from the cathode-ray tubes: 1. X-ray output is sporadic. Under identical condi- tions of operation, output may vary from one tubeto another or from the same tube from day to day. 2. Gas pressure within the tube is one of the control- ling factors in X-ray production. If there issufficient gas present, the accelerated electronswill collide with gas atoms and, therefore, nevergain enough energy to produce X rays. 3. Tube composition plays an important part in producing X rays. X-ray production is a functionof the target materials that the electrons strike. 4. The tube wall, if thick enough and of proper composition, can act as a shield for X rays. 5. The output of the tube is strongly dependent on the voltage and current capabilities of the powersource. The Department of Health recommends the following procedures in the use of cold cathode-raytubes: Tubes should be used only for demonstrations conducted by the instructor. Tubes should always be operated at the lowest possible current and voltage, and the time ofoperation should be kept to a minimum. No student should stand closer than 10 feet (3 m) from a tube when the tube is in operation. Radioactive Materials This section applies to situations in which indi- viduals or groups actively participate in investigationsor projects involving the use of radioactive materials.It does not refer to class demonstrations of the use ofradiation detectors or cloud chambers.The properties of radioactive materials have numerous applications in scientific research, medicine,and industry. These applications are anticipated notonly to continue but also to increase dramatically innumber and in kind. School district science programsshould provide students with an opportunity to investi-gate radiological theory and the uses of radioactivematerials to develop techniques and skills in handlingsuch materials safely. Licenses. California Code of Regulations, Title 17, states the conditions under which persons and institu-tions may possess and use radioactive materials: eithera school must have and use only small (exempt)quantities and concentrations of radioactive materialsor the school must have a specific license to possessand use radioactive materials. The terms are describedbelow: Possession or use of exempt quantities and concen- trations of materials, as defined in California Code of Regulations, Title 17, Section 30180, does not require the issuance of a specific license. Exemptmaterials include (a) any naturally occurringradioactive material (except uranium and thorium);(b) unprocessed ore which, in its natural form,contains uranium and thorium; (c) radioactivematerials in concentrations that do not exceed thosenoted in Schedule C of Title 17; and (d) radioactive materials, provided that the quantity of eachmaterial does not exceed the applicable quantitynoted in Schedule A of Title 17 and provided that not more than ten such quantities are possessed atany one time. Specific licenses, as defined in California Code of Regulations, Title 17, sections 30194 and 30195, are required if an individual or an institutionintends to possess or use quantities or concentra-tions of radioactive materials in excess of theamounts specified in schedules A and C. Informa-tion relating to specific licenses can be obtainedfrom the Department of Health Services, Radio-logic Health Branch, 714 P Street, Sacramento, CA95814. Applications for specific licenses must besigned by an appropriate school district staffmember, who has the responsibility for ensuringthat the radioactive material is used and storedsafely. The direct responsibility for safe use andstorage rests with an appropriately trained radiationsafety officer at the site of use. Both persons mustbe designated on the license application.G. Ionizing RadiationChapter 7. Additional Safety Practices96 Strict compliance with the conditions attached to specific licenses is required for approval of thelicenses. An amendment request must be submittedfor any change in the personnel using radioactivematerials, the radiation safety officer, or the site ofuse. A copy of the license must be maintained inthe school district staff offices as well as at the siteof use. All persons at the site of use must be awarethat they have access to the license and its condi-tions as well as to laws and regulations set forth inthe California Penal Code and the Health and Safety Code. Procurement and storage of radioisotopes. Before the first procurement of radioactive materials, theschool should make certain that a radiation surveymeter is available. The recommended type of radiationdetection instrument is an end window Geiger-Mueller(G-M) detector with a detection window of approxi-mately 2 mg/cm 2. When used properly, this instrument will detect alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. G-Mdetectors are available at relatively low cost; assistancein choosing the correct instrument can be provided byDOHS or a competent health physicist. Orders for procurement of radioisotopes, whether in exempt amounts or as allowed by specific license,must be approved by the appropriate school-siteadministrator and school district staff member. Onreceipt of the material, the teacher or designatedradiation safety officer (RSO) must take the followingsteps: Carefully inspect the package for damage before opening it. If there is no damage, open the package, inspect the contents, and compare the contents with thepacking slip. If there are any indications of external damage or contamination of the packing material or if thecontents do not match the packing slip, notify thevendor immediately and request disposal instruc-tions. In the interim place the package and contentsin a plastic bag, seal and store the bag, and monitorthe storage area for contamination. All schools in which radioactive materials are used must provide a secure storage location. The locationmust be kept locked when not in use, and access mustbe limited to designated persons only. The room mustbe properly posted and accurate records maintained ofeach isotope or source. Records must include the typeand quantity of isotope, date of assay, date of receipt,and usage information. No more than ten scheduled quantities of isotopes may be stored in any one school,as specified in the California Radiation ControlRegulations (California Code of Regulations, Title 17). Use of radioisotopes. The use of radioactive materials in classroom activities can provide valuableexperience in preparation for subsequent vocational oruniversity application. However, the use should beclosely supervised. The standard radiation symbol withthe words Caution\u2014Radioactive Material should be displayed both at the storage room and in the class-room when the isotopes are in use. Normally, the useof film badges or other types of radiation dosimeters isnot required when using exempt quantities of radioiso-topes. However, an operable radiation survey metershould always be available and should be used follow-ing the classroom exercise to verify that there is nocontamination on the hands or body or on surfaces thathave come into direct contact with the isotopes. Observance of the following rules will ensure that radioisotopes are used safely: Never handle radioactive sources with unprotected fingertips. The use of forceps or tongs will mini-mize exposure to the hands and fingers. Alpha emitters can be shielded easily by a sheet of paper; beta emitters should be shielded by one-quarter-inch lucite or glass. However, teachersshould remember that both of these sources areoften accompanied by the emission of gamma rays,which may require lead shielding. Exempt gamma-emitting sources can usually be shielded easily byone-quarter-inch lead. No experiments should be performed that might cause the release of gaseous radioactive products,nor should radioactive materials be disposed of insinks and drains or unmarked waste or trashcontainers. Disposal of unneeded radioactive materials. When teachers and administrators become aware of thepresence of radioactive sources and materials that arethe remains of old classroom activities, they shouldnever dispose of those materials as ordinary trash.Usually, the materials are partially or completelydecayed. The only acceptable methods of removal areby disposal as radioactive waste or by transfer to aperson or institution holding a specific license autho-rizing receipt of the material. Disposal as radioactive waste presents unique but not unsolvable problems. Radioactive sources andtrash must be kept separate from liquid materials,97 Hwhich must be absorbed against diatomaceous earth or a similar agent. Both must be packaged in steel drums,manifests must be prepared, and the material must betransferred to an authorized disposal company. Beforethat is done, the school must have an EPA number (seeChapter 5, section E, step 5; and the regulations inAppendix B, dealing with \"milkrun operations\" fortransporting hazardous waste) and a permit from oneof the three states that maintain low-level wastedisposal sites. (The same EPA number can be used fordisposal of chemicals and other hazardous materials.)The DOHS maintains a list of licensed waste-disposalcompanies; those companies will offer assistance withobtaining the necessary permits and licenses. An acceptable and less costly method of disposal of unwanted radioisotopes is by transfer to a specificlicensee. Inquire of nearby universities, colleges, andresearch organizations whether any has a license forthe particular type and quantity of material that youwish to dispose of. Disposal can usually be done for aminimal cost. The designated school district staffmember or radiation safety officer is responsible forfirst obtaining a copy of the receiver's license to verifythat it includes the material in question. Then thedesignated person is responsible for packaging thematerial for shipment or transfer, complying with otherreasonable requirements of the receiver, and obtaininga receipt for the material. The disposal process or transfer to a licensee must be coordinated with the appropriate school or schooldistrict staff. If the material to be disposed of ortransferred is material for which the school holds alicense and the intent is to abandon the license, theDOHS must be notified of such intent. A final inspec-tion will be conducted by that agency. Earthquake Preparation Earthquake! A strong shake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale smashes all the glass containers in thechemical storage area, allowing the chemicals tointermix and releasing toxic fumes and a corrosiveslurry strong enough to eat through the flooring andcement. That scenario may sound unreasonable, but it happened at Coalinga High School in 1983. ConsultantE. Robert Bulman concludes in his report, \"TheCoalinga Earthquake: A Report on Schools,\" thatalthough California's school buildings can structurallywithstand an earthquake of magnitude 6.5, the shaking will cause a tremendous amount of glass breakage. Herecommends the following preventive measures: (a)toxic chemicals must be stored on low shelves and inchemical-proof pans; (b) the floor must be acid-proof;(c) the school must keep an inventory of what is in thestoreroom; (d) the name of the nearest chemical burncenter should be posted in the chemistry laboratory;and (e) disaster drills must be conducted more fre-quently. (See also Chapter 5, section E, \"Steps forEstablishing a Safer Chemicals Storage Area.\") The experiences of Jack Grube, who was adminis- tering school science programs in the earthquake-damaged areas during both the magnitude 6.9 earth-quake in the San Francisco Bay Area on October 17,1989, and the 6.8 earthquake in Northridge, California,on January 17, 1994, demonstrate the importance ofpreparedness. He found that science preparation areasthat are properly managed and have good storagepractices can ride out strong earthquakes. There wasno damage to the contents of shelving that was securedto the wall and had retaining lips on the front edge.However, doors on storage cabinets did not protect thecontents as well as the secured shelves did becauselateral motion was able to throw doors open unlessthey were securely (purposefully) latched. He con-cludes that (a) earthquake procedures and drills shouldspecifically address the dangers of science storageareas; (b) science teachers (and facilities) should beprepared for emergencies and should be called on tosupervise cleanup after an earthquake, rather thancustodial and other inadequately trained personnel;and (c) battery-operated emergency lights shouldclearly illuminate chemical storage areas. The following sobering statement was made by the Bay Area Regional Earthquake Preparedness Project(BAREPP) in 1985: Approximately 80 percent of California's population is located within the Uniform BuildingCode's highest seismic risk zone out of the fivezones in the United States. The remainder of thestate is located in the next highest zone. Thistranslates to virtually a 100 percent chance ofexperiencing light shaking or worse during (thenext) 25 years. As urban areas in the vicinity of hazardous earth- quake regions become increasingly populated, theamount of death and destruction from earthquakes canbe expected to rise. Therefore, California's scienceH. Earthquake PreparationChapter 7. Additional Safety Practices98 teachers need to prepare now. Instructors should read this entire section on seismic safety, then act. Theearthquake safety measures outlined in this section areintended to augment the school's general emergency/disaster plans. The central components of any earthquake- response plan for seismic safety in science classesshould include, but not be limited to, the followingphases:1. Surveying the classroom and stockroom for nonstructural hazards 2. Performing hazard-reduction projects3. Creating an earthquake-response plan4. Procuring emergency equipment and supplies Completion of these four phases will help the school come into compliance with the requirements ofthe law to establish earthquake emergency procedures(Education Code sections 35295 through 35297 and 40041.5; see Appendix B).

Additional Safety Practices100 Phase 2: Hazard Reduction Projects After identifying the nonstructural hazards in your classroom, laboratory, stockroom, and preparationroom, you need to determine the most effectivemethod to mitigate those risks. Step one. Establish an earthquake awareness program. Central to earthquake preparedness is the earth- quake drill to teach students (and staff) how to respond immediately with life-protecting action. The proce- dures for earthquake drills in science instructionalareas need to be individualized for each room at eachsite; however, the following elements would be similarfor all: Duck, cover, and hold. (Students duck under their desks or tables, cover their neck and head, and holdon to a table leg.) Guard against potential hazards: \u2014 Extinguish flames.\u2014 Unplug electric cords.\u2014 Secure apparatus. (Perhaps, set them in sinks or on the floor.) \u2014 Shut off water, gas, and electricity master controls. \u2014 Have fire extinguishers at ready. Evacuate to an open area when necessary or safe to do so (instructor's decision). Comply with administrative instructions. The activities in this list are not necessarily in a set order. In an emergency the severity of the earthquakewill help dictate the order. If any of the actions toguard against hazards can be accomplished in theprocess of \"duck, cover, and hold,\" the situation wouldbecome much safer. Advance preparation for the drill and for a sizable earthquake emergency will facilitate each step. Teach-ers should lead students in each class through asimulated drill early in the course and repeat the drilloccasionally during the year. This practice shouldcarry over to staff preparation and response at homeand wherever else one may be during a real emer-gency. A simulated drill is also the time in which to correct deficiencies in the preparedness of the facility.Identify objects, structures, and furnishings that shouldbe avoided and those that might be used for protection.Objects, glassware, instruments, or books that are onshelves without earthquake lips (even those on shelveswith closed doors) are likely to dislodge and fall orbecome missiles. Objects (including containers of chemicals and solutions) standing on counters willlikely fall to the floor. Anything that can be used as acover (tables, chairs, books) to provide protection fromfalling ceiling tiles or other objects will decrease thelikelihood of injury. Each drill should be followed by an evaluation, including the assessment of any hazardous conditionthat should have been corrected. The follow-updiscussion should not only reinforce the idea of where to seek shelter and how to protect oneself but also provide a forum in which students can voice theirconcerns, thus minimizing the possibility of panic if anearthquake does occur. In addition, science staff should take the time to evaluate the preparedness of the entire department andgo through each room to estimate the consequences ofa severe earthquake at any given moment. This actionshould lead to continual improvement in the prepared-ness of basic structures as well as improved house-keeping procedures. Step two. Obtain or draw a map of the school and school grounds. Use the map to note potential hazardsand to mark the location of utilities, emergencyequipment, and supplies. Be sure to mark the locationsof the following items: Main shut-off valves for water and gas Electrical-power master switch Stoves and heating/air-conditioning equipment Chemical storage areas and gas lines in laboratories Fire extinguishers First-aid equipment 101 The map can also be used as the basis for (a) tracing an evacuation route; (b) locating a safeassembly area; and (c) creating an earthquake-response plan (e.g., planning first-aid and search-and-rescue strategies). Step three. Mitigate the nonstructural hazards. The following methods are suggested to rectify the hazards that were identified in Phase1 (a checklist ofthe more common nonstructural hazards found insecondary science classrooms). Each suggestion iscross-referenced to items in Phase 1. 1. Equipment/furnishings/fixtures a. Anchor all file cabinets, shelving, and bookcases to wall studs. ( Phase 1: 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d) b. Check cupboards and cabinets for secure latches that would stay locked during anearthquake. ( 1.1) c. Anchor all desktop computers and their components, televisions, aquariums, plants,sound systems, lamps, and other heavyitems. (1.e, 1.f, 1.i, and 1.m) d. Remove or secure any boxes or equipment stored on top of high cabinets. ( 1.h) *e. Check the secure attachment of any over- head fixtures, decorations, lighting, grills in walls, ceiling panels, latticework. 1.k) g. Put chocks under wheels of objects or wheels that lack built-in brakes. ( 1.e and 1.i) ranges). ( 1.i and 1.j) i. Post safety signs, symbols, and labels to reinforce safety precautions. 2. Hazardous/toxic materials a. Secure compressed gas cylinders or large tanks with strong nylon straps or heavy-dutychains. (2.b) b. Use wires or other barriers to restrain objects from falling from open shelving. ( 1.l and 2.c) c. Store chemicals in unbreakable containers and in accordance with the compatibilitysystem prescribed in this handbook (seeChapter 5, section E, step 7), or a similarsystem, to reduce the possible occurrence of incompatible mixtures. ( 2.d and 2.e) 3. Windows If the windows are not made of safety glass, a protective, transparent film may be applied toreduce the danger of flying glass and provide anadditional security measure against break-ins. (3) Phase 3: Emergency Response Plan (ERP) In response to the Statutes of 1984, Chapter 1659 (see relevant Education Code sections in Appendix B), most schools have already developed an earthquakeemergency procedure system that includes, but is notlimited to, the following: A school-building disaster plan A \"duck, cover, and hold\" drill (students duck under their desks, cover their neck and head, andhold onto a leg of the desk) Protective measures to be taken before, during, and after an earthquake A training program for students and staff on the earthquake emergency procedure system See Phase 2, step one, for more details on proce- dures specific to earthquake awareness in scienceinstructional areas. Schools should also have in their possession the excellent guide entitled Guidebook for Developing a School Earthquake Program, furnished a few years ago by the Federal Emergency Management Agency(FEMA). Phase 4: Emergency Equipment and Supplies The threat of an earthquake-related emergency varies considerably from one region of the state toanother. However, the basic equipment and suppliesthat science laboratory/classroom personnel need tohave on hand in the event of a severe earthquake arequite similar to those needed in other natural emergen-cies, such as fire, flood, or tornado, or in disastersresulting from air, railroad, or highway accidents.Furthermore, Education Code Section 40041.5 speci- fies that the school buildings, grounds, and equipmentmust be made available to the public agencies, includ-ing the American Red Cross, for mass care and welfareshelters during disasters or other emergencies (seeAppendix B). It is advisable and prudent to considersuch possibilities in the overall emergency planning.The most obvious needs would include the following:H. Earthquake Preparation *Additional help from the janitor or maintenance person may be needed.Chapter 7. Additional Safety Practices102 I A source of lighting, such as a flashlight, with fresh batteries as well as spare batteries and bulbs A battery-powered radio for receiving information and instructions A well-stocked first-aid kit A generous supply of water Science rooms already have available a number of safety features, including fire extinguishers, fireblanket, chemical spill-control kits, and eyewashstations. Because the science laboratory/classroom hasthe potential for the occurrence of unique injuries fromflammable, toxic, and corrosive substances, consider-ation should be given to the possibility of tap waterbeing unavailable. Additions to the list of emergencysupplies might include these items: Sterile squeeze bottles and spray bottles, useful for applying water to burns or spills of toxic or corro-sive substances on the skin or in the eye Extra water Extra fire blanket(s), both for the primary purpose of smothering fires and for maintaining bodywarmth during first-aid measures A plan must be established for replacing compo- nents regularly to ensure that all items are fullyavailable and functional at all times. During an emer-gency evacuation of the facility, the emergencysupplies, as appropriate, should be a part of the orderlydeparture. Waste Reduction The growing costs of the disposal of toxic waste and concern about the effects of toxic waste on hu-mans and the environment make the reduction ofwaste generated by schools an increasingly importantissue. By employing innovative strategies that effec-tively reduce the volume and toxicity of laboratorywaste, schools and school districts will reap thebenefits of (1) lower overall costs for waste disposal;(2) increased organization and safety in laboratory andstorage areas; and (3) decreased amounts of chemicalwaste. Such efforts will also contribute to the efforts ofeach city and county to divert 25 percent of their solidwaste from landfills by 1995 and 50 percent by 2000through source reduction, recycling, and composting,as mandated by the Public Resources Code (Division 30, Section 41780).A campuswide waste-management program that involves all departments, including those of art andphotography, auto shop, agriculture, and maintenanceoperations, provides the district with even greater costsavings in waste reduction. Pointing out to students,faculty, administrators, and maintenance staff thebenefits of reducing their personal exposure to poten-tially hazardous chemicals is essential in obtainingcampuswide commitment to the program. Vitalinformation about worker safety can be solicited fromindustrial hygienists who work in local industries. Andcommunity businesses can provide professionals whowill explain the advantages of source reduction. Oncecampuswide support for safety and reduction goals isestablished, the personal, fiscal, and ecological ben-efits will be evident almost immediately. Assessment of Current Waste Policy Before designing a waste-reduction plan, school authorities should perform an assessment of theschool's current waste-generation sources and waste-management practices. Such an audit will provideinsight into more effective waste-reduction methodsand assist in planning and allocating resources towardthe reduction of waste. Moreover, the audit willfurnish data to use as a baseline in monitoring theprogress of a waste-reduction plan. The assessmentshould be executed by knowledgeable staff membersor specially trained consultants. Appraisal objectivesshould include the following: Identification of the types and amounts of hazard- ous materials used and the waste generated in eachdepartment Identification of significant losses of materials and the factors that cause the losses; for example,inaccurately measured amounts of substances usedin experiments Suggested strategies for decreasing waste and stemming losses of materials Itemization of current waste-management costs and an estimate of the costs of proposed waste-reduc-tion practices When the assessment is complete, a flexible waste-reduction strategy can be generated. Development of a Campuswide Plan A campuswide waste-reduction plan should reflect changes in management practices as well as changes in103 everyday laboratory practices and the usage of chemi- cals. Waste reduction through prudent management practices. The following management practices will help create a thorough and effective waste-reductionplan: 1.Appoint a waste-management coordinator. Select a trained faculty member who has been accreditedthrough a college program or workshop on wastemanagement to implement an integrated waste-reduction program approved by the school board.A prime responsibility of the waste-managementcoordinator would be to ensure that the school isin compliance with current local, state, and federalwaste-management regulations. 2.Provide employees with information about waste reduction. To enhance schoolwide awareness and participation, inform employees of the necessityof waste reduction and the ways in which it can beachieved. Hands-on experiences provide the mosteffective learning forum for faculty and staff.Arrange follow-up meetings within each depart-ment to give all employees the opportunity todiscuss and critique the effectiveness of theirreduction efforts. 3.Centralize purchasing. Schools should consider developing a system for buying chemicals througha centralized district or consortium purchasingagent. The purchaser would monitor all requestsreceived from the entire district or consortium andplace money-saving bulk orders for chemicals,then distribute the chemicals to the schools. 4.Prevent overstocking. Within each school, teach- ers can prevent overstocking and ensure theavailability of fully potent chemicals by sharingchemicals among common users and buyingchemicals only as needed. A practice that isinitially slightly more expensive (but will savemoney in the long run) is the purchase of achemical in several small bottles. This systemhelps to stem the loss of large amounts of achemical reagent through accidental contamina-tion and makes it easier to manage unusedamounts. Another successful cost-cutting strategyis to estimate the amount of a chemical reagentthe school (all departments) will use in one yearand order only that amount at the beginning of theyear. Bulk ordering for multiple years of predicteduse is discouraged. Although a school may seemto take advantage of unit cost savings by orderinglarge quantities, there is often no net savings for the school because of the ever-increasing cost ofdisposal of outdated, unused chemicals. 5.Choose a responsible vendor. Schools can encour- age better customer service from chemical suppli-ers by ordering supplies from those who providequick delivery, accept the return of unopenedstock, and offer off-site waste-management outletsor cooperatives for laboratory waste. Thesecustomer service benefits should be solicited fromcompany representatives before orders are placed and should be considered as the basis for futureorders. 6.Establish an inventory control program. An inventory control program should be establishedto trace the volume of waste generated. Theinventory would enable more accurate tracking ofall incoming chemicals from the time they arriveuntil they are disposed of as hazardous waste.Improved access to accurate inventory lists by allauthorized district and school personnel willenable the sharing of chemicals between commonusers, provide data on all courses in which poten-tially hazardous chemicals are utilized, allowinstructors to track the consumption of the chemi-cals they use and locate unused reagents, andallow the monitoring of the shelf life of chemi-cals. The program could be implemented on eitherthe district or individual school level by means ofa computer database and specialized software or astandard filing system. Waste reduction through everyday laboratory practices, proper equipment, and experimental design.Although waste audits and up-to-date waste-manage-ment practices are essential to a campuswide waste-reduction program, the full cooperation and under-standing of laboratory instructors are necessary if theprogram is to achieve success. According to the Waste Audit Study of Research and Educational Institutions,prepared for the California Department of HealthServices' Toxic Substances Control Division (now theDepartment of Toxic Substances Control), schools canmarkedly minimize waste generation by taking thefollowing actions in the laboratory: Before the laboratory experiment 1.Perform regular inspections. By regularly inspect- ing all containers, the instructor can quicklyreplace those that are cracked or broken and soprevent spills and leaks.I. Waste ReductionChapter 7. Additional Safety Practices104 2.Preweigh materials. After students master the skill of using the balance to weigh substances, it maybe practical to preweigh materials for them.Students' laboratory productivity can be increasedby reducing the time spent waiting for eachstudent to weigh his or her materials. Preweighingchemicals also helps to prevent the contaminationof substances, a problem that becomes more likelywhen many people are obtaining samples from thesame bottle. Trained and properly supervisedlaboratory assistants who have reviewed thepertinent MSDS for each hazardous substance tobe handled may perform the preweighing tasks. 3.Use less-hazardous chemicals. Substituting less- hazardous chemicals for chemicals that presenthealth and environmental risks can reduce the useof more harmful chemicals. A reference on thisstrategy is New Chemicals for Old, Preserving the Student Lab Experiment, by R. Benedict (Minne- sota Department of Education, 1987). 4.Reduce metal-bearing waste. Experiments that generate metal-bearing waste can be expensivebecause of the high cost of the processing treat-ments for heavy metals. Any commingling of less-hazardous waste with heavy metals causes theentire mixture to be classified as a heavy-metalwaste and greatly increases the cost of disposal.Many heavy metals, such as hexavalent chro-mium, have recently been placed on the list titled\"Extremely Hazardous Chemicals for PromptDisposal\" because of their carcinogenic or toxicnature (see Chapter 5, Table 2, of this handbook).Therefore, experiments that call for their useshould be either modified or removed from thelaboratory curriculum. Experiments that generateheavy metals should be carefully monitored sothat waste streams are not mixed. If nonmetallicreagents are substituted for those containingmetals, the district will probably encounter lowerdisposal costs. During the laboratory experiment 1.Use efficient dispensers. Using containers that dispense their contents through pumps and spigotswill reduce the likelihood of spills and measure-ment errors. 2.Reduce wet chemistry. In some circumstances the use of instrument methods instead of wet-chemis-try procedures will help in reducing waste becauseinstrument analysis requires much smaller quanti-ties of chemicals.3.Avoid generating waste. Sometimes chemicals can be rendered \"sewerable\" in the final steps of anexperiment. In that case the process will not onlyreduce the need for off-site disposal but alsoincrease students' awareness of proper wastemanagement and waste reduction. A thoroughreference on this strategy is Prudent Practices for Disposal of Chemicals from Laboratories(Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press,1983), Chapters 5 and 6. 4.Scale-down experiments. The volume of chemi- cals used in experiments can be reduced bypracticing microscale chemistry (described in thefollowing subsection). After the laboratory experiment 1.Recycle experimental products. Recycling chemi- cals by using the product of one experiment in thestudent's next experiment is an effective waygreatly to diminish the amounts of fresh chemicalsused in the laboratory. An entire college-levellaboratory curriculum that focuses on using cyclicexperiments is presented in The No Waste Lab Manual: A Procedure That Eliminates Toxic WasteProduction from Introductory Chemistry Labora-tory Courses (California Department of Health Services, 1989). 2.Clean containers according to state regulations. Costly disposal fees may be reduced by thor-oughly emptying all used chemical containers.California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 66261.7, addresses the handling of contaminatedcontainers and encourages recycling and otheroptions for disposal of \"empty\" containers.Containers once filled with hazardous waste canbe disposed of as nonhazardous waste provided certain stipulations are met. See Appendix T for definitions of empty containers and disposaloptions. 3.Reuse solvents. Use spent solvents for the initial cleaning of glassware; use fresh solvent only forthe final rinsing. Waste reduction through microscale chemistry. One of the most effective ways in which to achievewaste reduction is by using smaller volumes of chemi-cals to perform microscale laboratory experiments. Inmost microscale experiments the chemical quantitiescan be reduced to between one-tenth and one-thousandth of the usual scale. The main advantagesof this approach include the following: (1) less money105 Jis spent on chemicals; (2) less waste is produced; (3) exposure to hazardous chemicals is reduced;(4) reduction in the volume of reagents for ecologicaland safety reasons can be modeled to students; and(5) the results of the experiment can often be deter-mined more quickly. The transformation of a laboratory from macroscale to microscale is easily accomplished.Some new materials must be purchased but these arerelatively inexpensive. One cost-effective way ofconverting is to purchase reuseable plastic or polysty-rene tissue-culture plates and plastic pipettes. Becausewater is the solvent used most often in high schoolexperiments, the chemical stability of the plastic is notusually a problem. If plastic is unsuitable for organicchemistry, microscale glassware can be substituted,although it is slightly more expensive. Nearly allchemical suppliers now carry the equipment necessaryfor microscale experiments. Several publications are available on experiments using microscale chemistry. Most focus on organicchemistry because minimization efforts are most cost-effective with those kinds of chemicals. Some refer-ence books on the chemistry laboratory are as follows: Mayo, D. W.; R. Pike; and S. S. Butcher. Microscale Organic Laboratory (Second edition). New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1989. Microscale Experiments for the High School Chemistry Class.

Employees' Exposure to Hazardous Chemicals Safety in school laboratories is a high priority to Cal/OSHA, as evidenced by the addition of laboratorystandards issued in the California Code of Regula- tions, Title 8, Section 5191 (see Appendix B). That section of the law requires employers (e.g., schooldistricts) to take specific action toward minimizingemployees' exposure to hazardous chemicals. Thefollowing is a summary of the major changes in thestandards (all sections cited here are from California Code of Regulations, Title 8 ): Exposure Limits The employer must ensure that an employee's exposure to substances regulated by Cal/OSHA doesnot exceed the exposure limits specified under \"Gen- eral Industry Safety Orders\" (GISO), Section 5139. Determination of Employees' Exposure The employer must measure an employee's exposure to regulated substances if there is reason tobelieve that exposure levels for those substancesexceed the action levels or permissible exposure limits(Section 5191 [c] and [d]). Monitoring must be doneby a person competent in industrial hygiene practiceand must occur periodically if the employee's expo-sure level proves to be over the action level or permis-sible exposure limit. The results of the monitoringmust be made available to the employee in writingwithin 15 working days. Chemical Hygiene Plan If the workplace contains hazardous chemicals, employers should have developed and implemented awritten chemical hygiene plan (CHP) by October 31,1991. The purpose of the CHP is to protect employeesfrom exposure to harmful levels of hazardous sub-stances (Section 5191[e]). The plan must be madeavailable to employees, employee representatives, and,on request, the Chief of the Division of OccupationalSafety and Health and must provide for the followingactions by the employer: 1. Provide standard laboratory operating procedures that are relevant to the safety and health ofemployees using hazardous chemicals. 2. Explain control measures that reduce employees' exposure to hazardous chemicals; for example,engineering controls, protective equipment, andhygiene practices. 3. Provide properly functioning fume hoods and biological safety cabinets that comply withsections 5154.1 and 5154.2 (see Appendix B) andcheck them regularly to ensure proper and ad-equate performance. 4. Provide each employee with information and training about the CHP and all hazardous chemi-cals in the workplace at the time of an employee'sinitial assignment and each time a new hazardoussubstance is used. The frequency of the presenta-J. Employees' Exposure to Hazardous ChemicalsChapter 7. Additional Safety Practices106 Ktion of refresher information and training must be decided by the employer (Section 5191[f]). Theemployer must inform all employees of the newregulations contained in Section 5191, the con-tents of the employer's CHP, the Cal/OSHAexposure limits for regulated substances, therecommended exposure limits for hazardoussubstances not regulated by Cal/OSHA, medicalinformation on symptoms associated with expo-sure, and the location of references (e.g., MSDS)that provide information about the hazardouschemicals with which employees work. Theemployer must also provide training on methodsused to detect the presence or release of hazardouschemicals, the hazards of each chemical used, andmeasures that can be taken to avoid exposure. 5. Define the circumstances under which particular laboratory operations require prior approval fromthe employer. 6. Provide free medical consultation and examina- tions on suspicion of exposure to hazardoussubstances (Section 5191[g]). The employer mustobtain the written opinion of the physician aboutconditions of the employee relating only to the exposure. 7. Designate personnel responsible for the imple- mentation of the CHP, including a chemicalhygiene officer. The officer must be qualified bytraining or experience to provide guidance indeveloping and implementing the CHP. 8. Provide additional employee protection when particularly hazardous substances will be handled.Note: Substances on the list titled \"Extremely Hazardous Chemicals for Prompt Disposal\"(Table 2) should already have been removed fromschool laboratories. 9. Review and analyze the effectiveness of the CHP annually and update it as necessary. A useful reference for developing a CHP for your school or school district is the Model Chemical Hygiene Plan for Kentucky School Districts, produced by Kentucky Science and Technology Council, Inc.,the Kentucky Department of Education, and theFayette County Public School District.

The text is also available on disk for usewith Macintosh or IBM-compatible computers.Recordkeeping The employer must establish and maintain accu- rate records and monitor employee exposures andexaminations. Employees' Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens The California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 5193 (see excerpts in Appendix B), requiresthat each employer whose employees, in the course oftheir occupation, may be exposed to bloodbornepathogens must establish a written exposure controlplan designed to eliminate or minimize such exposure.Selected school district employees may have suchoccupational exposure. The following material sum-marizes the regulation: Background Certain pathogenic organisms can be found in the blood of infected individuals and may be transmittedto other individuals by blood or certain body fluids.The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and thehepatitis B virus (HBV) are the two most significantbloodborne pathogens. Individuals whose occupationalduties may expose them to blood or other potentiallyinfectious materials are at risk of being infected withthese bloodborne pathogens and developing disease,infecting others, and, in some cases, dying. Exposure Control Plan The written exposure control plan (ECP) must contain the following elements: 1.Exposure Determination. The employer shall maintain a list of all job classifications in whichemployees have or may have occupational expo-sure and a list of the tasks and procedures thatplace them at risk. 2.Methods of Compliance. Universal precautions shall be observed, as follows, to prevent contactwith blood or other potentially infectious materi-als. If differentiation between types of body fluidsis difficult, all shall be considered potentiallyinfectious. Engineering controls (for example, provid- ing sharps-disposal containers with which toisolate or remove the hazard from the work-place) and work practice controls (dealing with handwashing; handling of sharps; eating,107 drinking, smoking, and so forth in the work area; control of splashes and droplets; prohi-bition of mouth pipetting; leakproof contain-ers; and labeling practices). These controlsshall be established to eliminate or minimizeemployee exposure. Personal protective equipment, when occu- pational exposure exists. Personal protectiveequipment may include, but is not limited to,gloves, gowns, laboratory coats, face shieldsor masks, eye-protective devices, mouth-pieces, resuscitation bags, pocket masks, andother ventilation devices. Housekeeping . The work site shall be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition;equipment and environmental and workingsurfaces shall be cleaned and decontaminatedafter exposure; and regulated waste shall beappropriately stored and disposed of. Warninglabels in fluorescent orange or orange-redshall either be securely affixed to containersof regulated waste or be an integral part ofthe container. The label shall include thefollowing symbol and legend: BIOHAZARD or, in the case of regulated waste, the legend: BIOHAZARDOUS WASTE Hepatitis B Virus Vaccination After appropriate training and within 10 days of their initial working assignment, designated employeesshall be offered, at no cost to themselves, vaccination against the hepatitis B virus. A record shall be kept ofdesignated employees' acceptance or declination of thevaccine. Postexposure Evaluation and Follow-up All unvaccinated employees who have rendered assistance in any situation involving the presence ofblood or other potentially infectious material, whether or not a specific exposure incident occurred, shall beoffered vaccination against the hepatitis B virus.Incident reports shall be maintained about each suchoccurrence, and arrangements shall be made for aconfidential medical evaluation, counseling, andappropriate postexposure prophylaxis. Hazard Communication (Training) All designated employees are to be trained at the time of their initial assignments and at least annuallythereafter. The training is to include information onand an explanation of the following: The contents of the regulatory text and its accessi- bility to employees Bloodborne diseases and their modes of transmis- sion The exposure control plan Recognition of tasks that may involve exposure Ways in which to prevent or reduce exposure Use and handling of protective equipment Appropriate action to be taken and procedures to be followed if an exposure incident occurs The availability, free of charge, of the hepatitis B vaccine Postexposure evaluation and follow-up An opportunity for interactive questions and answers is also required. Recordkeeping The medical record of each designated employee shall include (1) the employee's hepatitis B vaccina-tion status; (2) the results of related testing, and (3) copiesof any health-care professional's written opinion orother information; (4) an incidents log of all first-aidincidents; and (5) the employee's training records. The employee's medical records shall be kept confidential and maintained for at least the duration ofemployment plus 30 years. Training records shall bemaintained for three years from the date on which thetraining occurred. All required records shall be made available to the Chief of Cal/OSHA and the National Institute ofOccupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) for exami-nation and copying.K.

By now, most teachers are aware of thefactors that contribute to gross negligence and thus toliability for accidents that occur in the classroom or thefield. In each of the cases described below, a science teacher was being sued for liability. As a member of the jury, wouldyou judge these teachers guilty or not? Assume that therelevant facts have been given. Place a check in front ofeach case in which you would vote for a guilty verdict. Theanswers will be given below. 1. A biology teacher requested a student to bring a glass beaker from the back of the room to his demonstrationtable. The student slipped and fell and received seriouswounds from the broken beaker. 2. A student in a chemistry laboratory injured himself while inserting a piece of glass tubing into a rubberstopper. The teacher had previously demonstrated andproperly instructed all the students concerning themethod and danger involved. The student attempted toforce the glass tubing into the stopper and was injuredwhen the tubing snapped and went through the palm ofhis hand. 3. During a physics lab a teacher stepped out of the classroom for a few minutes to obtain a reference bookfrom the library. In his absence, a serious accidentoccurred. 4. On a field trip a science teacher led his students across a precarious-looking footbridge. The bridge collapsed,causing serious injury to several students.5. A teacher asked two students to clean a chemical stockroom, warning them of an unlabeled jar of acid ona high shelf. A scuffle caused the acid to fall, and thestudents were seriously burned. 6. A student was sent to the drugstore in his own car to purchase some hydrogen peroxide. While returning, hehit another car when he ran a red light. He had noinsurance, and the accident victim sued the teacher. 7. A student was asked to water the plants in the green- house lab adjoining the botany classroom. The studentcarried a glass full of water, tried to climb a chair, andwas seriously injured when the chair collapsed. Thechair was in good repair. 8. Three students in a chemistry class were making up a lab exercise on the preparation and properties ofoxygen. The teacher told them to gather the materialsnecessary to the experiment and to follow the safetydirections in the write-up. Contrary to the directions inthe write-up, the students mixed potassium chloratewith red phosphorus and ferric oxide and heated themwith a Bunsen burner. An explosion resulted, andseveral students were injured. Answers: The jury voted guilty in numbers three; four; six; and eight. Did you?

Teachers should be encouragedto use these instructional techniques as physical on-siteactivity is important to the development of knowledge,concept, processes, skills, and scientific attitudes. Inherentin such physical activities is the potential for injury andpossible resulting litigation. All such liability must beshared by both school districts and teachers, utilizing clearlydefined safety procedures and a prudent insurance plan. TheNational Science Teachers Association (NSTA) recommendsthat school districts and teachers adhere to the followingguidelines: I. School districts should develop and implement safety procedures for laboratory investigationsand field trips. II. School districts should be responsible for the actions of their teachers and be supportive of theuse of laboratory activities and field trips asteaching techniques. III. School districts should look to NSTA for help in informing teachers about safety procedures andencouraging them to act responsibly in matters ofsafety and related liability.IV. School districts should provide liability and tort insurance for the teachers. V. Teachers, acting as agents of the school districts, should utilize laboratory investigations and fieldtrips as instructional techniques. VI. Teachers should learn safe procedures for laboratory activities and field trips and followthem as a matter of policy. VII. Teachers should exercise reasonable judgment and supervision during laboratory activities andfield trips. VIII. Teachers should expect to be held liable if they fail to follow district policy and litigation ensues. IX. School districts and teachers should share the responsibilities of establishing safety standardsand seeing that they are adhered to. \u2014Adopted by the NSTA Board of Directors in July, 1985.

Legislative findings and declarations The Legislature finds and declares the following:(a) Because of the generally acknowledged fact that California will experience moderate to severe earthquakes inthe foreseeable future, increased efforts to reduce earth-quake hazards should be encouraged and supported. (b) In order to minimize loss of life and disruption, it is necessary for all public or private elementary schools andhigh schools to develop school disaster plans and specifi-cally an earthquake emergency procedure system so thatstudents and staff will act instinctively and correctly whenan earthquake disaster strikes. (c) It is therefore the intent of the Legislature in enacting this article to authorize the establishment ofearthquake emergency procedure systems in kindergartenand grades 1 through 12 in all the public or private schoolsin California. 35296. Establishment of systems The governing board of each school district and the county superintendent of schools of each county shallestablish an earthquake emergency procedure system inevery public school building under its jurisdiction havingoccupant capacity of 50 or more pupils or more than oneAppendix B113 classroom. The governing board of each private school shall establish an earthquake emergency procedure system inevery private school building under its jurisdiction havingan occupant capacity of 50 or more pupils or more than oneclassroom. Governing boards and county superintendentsmay work with the Office of Emergency Services and theSeismic Safety Commission to develop and establish theearthquake emergency procedure systems. 35297. Components of system The earthquake emergency procedure system shall include, but not be limited to, all of the following: (a) A school building disaster plan, ready for implemen- tation at any time, for maintaining the safety and care ofstudents and staffs. (b) A drop procedure. As used in this article, \"drop procedure\" means an activity whereby each student andstaff member takes cover under a table or desk, dropping tohis or her knees, with the head protected by the arms, andthe back to the windows. A drop procedure practice shall beheld at least once each school quarter in elementary schoolsand at least once a semester in secondary schools. (c) Protective measures to be taken before, during, and following an earthquake. (d) A program to ensure that the students and that both the certificated and classified staff are aware of, andproperly trained in, the earthquake emergency proceduresystem. 40041.5. Mass care and welfare shelters Notwithstanding Section 40043, the governing board of any school district shall grant the use of school buildings,grounds, and equipment to public agencies, including theAmerican Red Cross, for mass care and welfare sheltersduring disasters or other emergencies affecting the publichealth and welfare. The governing board shall cooperatewith these agencies in furnishing and maintaining suchservices as the governing board may deem necessary tomeet the needs of the community. Hazardous Materials Education49340. This article shall be known and may be cited as the California Hazardous Materials Education Act of 1982. Section 3 of Stats. 1982, c. 785, p. 3046, provides: \"This act shall not be construed to impose any change in theduty of care required of school districts.\" 49341. The Legislature hereby finds and declares as follows: (a) Because school science laboratories pose a poten- tially serious threat to the health and safety of school pupilsand school personnel due to the use and storage of hazard-ous materials in these laboratories, educational efforts are needed to increase the awareness of persons dealing withthese materials in these settings so that possible losses oflife, injuries, loss of property, and social disruption whichcould result from the improper and unsafe use of hazardousmaterials will be minimized. (b) Effective safety in school laboratories requires informed judgment, decision making, and operatingprocedures by those responsible for laboratory and relatedinstruction. It is desirable that each high school and juniorhigh, middle, or elementary school offering laboratory workhave a trained member of the professional staff who isdesignated as the building laboratory consultant and who is responsible for the review, updating, and carrying out of theschool's adopted procedures for laboratory safety. [empha- sis added] (c) Efforts by state and local agencies to implement training programs designed to provide qualified individualswith the necessary information, organizational skills, andmaterials to assist schools and teachers in the developmentof their laboratory safety policies and procedures arenonexistent or inadequate, and it is necessary that thissituation be remedied. The state should assume leadershipthrough the policy and guidance of the State Department ofEducation in the development, support, and implementationof a statewide training program. (d) The Legislature requests that the Department of Education consider making this program a part of thedepartment's energy and environmental education programwhich is conducted pursuant to Chapter 4 (commencingwith Section 8700) of Part 6. 49401.5. Use and storage of hazardous materials; consulta- tion services (a) It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this section to express its concern for the health and safety ofschool pupils and school personnel at schools wherehazardous materials are stored on the school premises, andto encourage school districts to take steps to ensure hazard-ous materials are properly used and stored. (b) The governing board of any school district may request consultation services from the California Occupa-tional Safety and Health Consultation Service to ensurehazardous materials are being used and stored safely inschool laboratories. 49411. Listing of chemical compounds used in school programs; guidelines for removal (a) The State Department of Education, in cooperation with the Division of Occupational Safety and Health withinthe Department of Industrial Relations, shall formulate a listing of chemical compounds used in school programs thatincludes the potential hazards and estimated shelf life ofeach compound. [emphasis added]Appendix B114 (b) The Superintendent of Public Instruction, in cooperation with the Division of Occupational Safety andHealth within the Department of Industrial Relations, shalldevelop guidelines for school districts for the regularremoval and disposal of all chemicals whose estimated shelflife has elapsed. (c) The county superintendent of schools may imple- ment a system for disposing of chemicals from schoolswithin the county or may permit school districts to arrangefor the disposal of the chemicals.

Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory [The following is a summary of the relevant sections of Chapter 6.95. Ed.] 25500. In order to protect public health and safety and the environment, it is necessary to establish business and areaplans relating to the handling and release of hazardousmaterials. Basic information on location, type, quantity, andthe health risks of hazardous materials handled, used, stored,or disposed of is necessary to prevent or mitigate thedamage to the health and safety of persons and the environ-ment from the release or threatened release of hazardousmaterials into the workplace and environment. 25502. Every county is required, through a designated adminis- tering agency, to implement the establishment of businessand area plans as to the handling of hazardous materials andassure availability and access of information to emergencyrescue personnel and other appropriate entities. A city mayassume that responsibility within its boundaries, coordinat-ing its activities with the county in which it is located. 25503.3 Businesses handling hazardous materials shall annually complete a hazardous materials reporting form and submit itto the administering agency. 25503.5 Any business which handles a quantity of hazardous material which at any time during the year is equal to orgreater than a total weight of 500 lbs or a total volume of 55gallons, or 200 cubic feet at standard temperature andpressure for compressed gas, shall establish and implement a business plan for emergency response to a release orthreatened release of a hazardous material. 25504. Business plans shall include a chemical inventory as required by Section 25509, emergency response plans in theevent of a reportable release or threatened release ofhazardous material, and training for all new employees andannual training regarding release or threatened release ofhazardous materials. 25505. Each handler shall submit its business plan to the administering agency. 25507. Handlers shall immediately report any release or threatened release to the administering agency and providefire, health, safety, and/or rescue personnel access to thefacilities. 25509.

For each eligible claimant (which certified its compli- ance with the guidelines by June 30, 1988), reimbursablecosts are all costs for the regular removal and disposal ofchemicals that have not yet reached a \"retrograde\" condition(Health and Safety Code Section 25121.5; see the list under section G of this appendix) but still pose a significant threatto the health and safety of teachers, staff, and students, asestablished by the most current Department of Educationguidelines. The actual costs for one fiscal year shall be included in each claim. The estimated costs for the subsequent year maybe included in the same claim, if applicable. All claims forthe reimbursement of costs shall be submitted within 120days of notification by the State Controller of the enactmentof the claims bill. If the total costs for a given fiscal year do not exceed $200, no reimbursement shall be allowed, except as other-wise allowed by Government Code Section 17564. A. Reimbursable Costs Reimbursement is available for elementary, secondary, and unified school districts. The costs of ongoing removaland disposal may include, but are not limited to, thefollowing: 1. Salaries and benefits of personnel at school sites, district offices, and county offices of education, bothcertificated and classified, who perform any dutiesrelated to compliance with this mandate; salaries andbenefits of substitute employees who provided cover-age for employees performing duties related to saidmandates. 2. Consultant fees for preparation of initial chemical inventories, preparation of chemical profile inventoriesfor chemical disposal purposes, supervision (monitor-ing) of contractor during on-site related activities. 3. All contractor fees/charges for review and computer entry of inventories. 4. All costs for the regular removal and disposal of chemicals that have not yet reached a \"retrograde\"condition ( Health and Safety Code Section 25121.5) but still pose a significant threat to the health andsafety of teachers, staff, and students, as established bythe most current Department of Education guidelines. The costs of regular removal and disposal may include,but are not limited to, the following: a. Consultant fees for supervision of lab-packing, loading, and so forth. b. Contractor fees and charges for the packing of laboratory chemicals and transportation of wasteand the charges associated with the final disposi-tion of the waste material, including treatment,recycling, incineration, and landfill disposal. c. All costs incurred by the school district for packing the chemicals in-house, using districtpersonnel. These costs may include disposablebody suits; protective gloves; shipping containers(drums, liners, etc.) approved by the Departmentof Transportation (DOT); absorbent materials forspill containment and lab-packing; DOT-approved shipping labels for DOT containers;publications used for reference by and training ofdistrict personnel, including this document,Science Safety Handbook for California PublicSchools. d. Other miscellaneous costs incurred by the district that are imposed by local, state, and federalgovernmental agencies. These costs are normallycharged by the particular agency as taxes orsurcharges, such as excise tax fees, generatorfees, and superfund taxes. These costs arereimbursable only to the extent that they areincurred for the disposal of chemicals that havenot yet reached a \"retrograde\" condition, asspecified above. B. Nonreimbursable Activities All costs incurred after June 30, 1988, associated with the removal of chemicals that meet the definition of\"retrograde materials,\" as defined in Health and Safety Code Section 25121.5, are nonreimbursable.

Signature of Authorized Representative Date Title TelephoneG. Chemicals to Be Removed from School ScienceLaboratories The following list identifies three groups of chemicals: 1. Those chemicals included on lists of hazardous chemicals that were recommended for removal anddisposal in the 1987 edition of this handbook andwhich, at this time, are considered \"retrograde materi-als\" are identified with an asterisk (*). (See definitionof retrograde materials in Appendix B, Health and Safety Code Section 25125.5.) The costs for disposal of these \"retrograde materials\" are not considered reimbursable. 2. Chemicals that have been added to the previous lists of hazardous chemicals recommended for immediate orprompt removal and disposal (see tables 1, 2, and 3)are identified with two asterisks (**). The costs fordisposal of these chemicals are considered reimburs- able. 3. Chemicals that are subject to regular removal and disposal, on approaching their estimated shelf life,because they pose a significant threat to the health andsafety of teachers, staff, and students but have not yetreached a \"retrograde\" condition have no asterisk. The costs for disposal of these materials are reimbursable.

You will be working with materials andapparatus which, if handled carelessly or improperly, havethe potential to cause injury or discomfort to someone elseas well as yourself. A science laboratory can be a safe place in which to work if you, the student, are foresighted, alert, and cautious.The following practices will be followed: 1. Report any accident to the teacher immediately, no matter how minor, including reporting any burn,scratch, cut, or corrosive liquid on skin or clothing. 2. Prepare for each laboratory activity by reading all instructions before coming to class. Follow all direc-tions implicitly and intelligently. Make note of anymodification in procedure given by the instructor. 3. Any science project or individually planned experiment must be approved by the teacher. 4. Use only those materials and equipment authorized by the instructor. 5. Inform the teacher immediately of any equipment not working properly. 6. Clean up any nonhazardous spill on the floor or work space immediately. 7. Wear appropriate eye protection, as directed by the instructor, whenever you are working in the laboratory.Safety goggles must be worn during hazardousactivities involving caustic/corrosive chemicals,heating of liquids, and other activities that may injurethe eyes. 8. Splashes and fumes from hazardous chemicals present a special danger to wearers of contact lenses. There-fore, students should preferably wear regular glasses(inside splash-proof goggles, when appropriate) duringall class activities or purchase personal splash-proofgoggles and wear them whenever exposure to chemi-cals or chemical fumes is possible. 9.

The school or the school district must have a written plan (if the plan is for the school district, it should be written to include the schools involved) for, or exemption from, each of the following: Chemical hygiene plan (CHP), California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5191 (required of all employers in workplaces in which there is laboratory use of hazardous chemicals; the CHP is to includesafe operating procedures, use of protective equipment, employee information and training, provisionsfor medical consultations and examinations, and designation of a chemical hygiene officer) Bloodborne pathogens exposure control plan, California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5193 (required of all employers with employees reasonably anticipated to have exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials in the performance of their duties) Hazard communication; material safety data sheet (MSDS), California Code of Regulations, Title 8, Section 5194 (may be included in chemical hygiene plan noted above [see also Chapter 5, section E];required of all employers in workplaces in which hazardous chemicals are used unless all exposedemployees are under the direct supervision and regular observation of an individual with knowledge ofphysical and health hazards and emergency procedures and who conveys this knowledge to employees interms of safe work practices. Labels and MSDSs received must be maintained and available to employees) 2. The school or school district has implemented a plan for the safe storage, use, and disposal of hazardous chemicals ( Education Code Section 49411). 3. The implementation of the overall safety plan makes provisions at all levels for instruction and training, responsible supervision, and adequate and well-maintained facilities and equipment. 4. Safety equipment includes each of the following, as appropriate: Fire extinguisher for classes A, B, and C fires Dry sand or other provision for class D fires Fire blanket Splash-proof goggles and sterilizer Eyewash or eyewash and facewash hose Deluge shower Chemical-spill kit Fume hood First-aid kit 5. Teachers are prepared to safely handle, use, and store science supplies and equipment as well as safety equipment. Documentation of staff training should be maintained on both school and school district sites. 6. A safety assessment is regularly made of the science classrooms/laboratories and auxiliary rooms (e.g., by using the \"Safety Checklist for Science Instruction, Preparation, and Storage Areas,\" found in Appendix H) 7. Each science teacher consciously includes safety as a component in planning and conducting each lesson, demonstration, and activity. 8. Classrooms are inspected daily for irregularities or dangerous conditions, including, but not limited to, faulty equipment, improper ventilation, and missing or nonfunctional safety supplies. 9. Potential dangers (safety hazards, defective equipment, or unsafe conditions) that cannot be readily corrected within the department are reported immediately to the site administrator for necessary action. 160Appendix L 10. Each class is provided with proper initial instruction in safety procedures, specific to the subject, which are reviewed regularly. The review includes the following: Use of safety equipment, devices, and materials Proper laboratory preparation, attire, and attitude Proper use of material and equipment Disposal and clean-up procedures 11. Documentation files are maintained on the types of instruction given and the dates on which safety-related topics were demonstrated, conducted, or tested. 12. Student safety consent/contract forms, which attest to initial safety instruction and a knowledge of laboratory regulations and potential dangers, are signed by the student and a parent or guardian and retained by the teacher. 13. The school and school district fire and earthquake drills and emergency procedures include special provisions relating to science equipment, facilities, and materials. Procedures are included for contacting communityresources (fire department, ambulance, paramedics, hospital, doctor). 14. A report is made of any injury, illness, or incident, including appropriate procedures for remediation. 15. Safety guidelines adopted by the school and school district are reviewed and updated on a regular basis. By following the suggestions noted above, instructors, schools, school districts, and students can improve their ability to conduct laboratory activities safely and effectively. Failure to implement the procedures increases the relative degree ofliability of school districts and individuals.161 161Sample Chemical Inventory School Room DateInventory prepared byDate Chemical Concentration Type of Hazard Storage Storage Shelf MSDS acquired name /Purity container Quantity class location compatibility life available Notes8-94 Acetic acid 1.0 Glass 1 liter2-94 Acetone 99.5% Metal can 400 mlAPPENDIX M162 APPENDIX N DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAZARD CLASSES The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has completed a list of materials that are designated as hazard-ous for the purpose of transportation of those materials incommerce. The list, labeled \"Hazardous Materials Table\" inthe Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, Transportation, specifies for each listed material a hazard class (or division within the class) that affects the required packaging,mailing, and labeling of the material. The hazard classspecification is important to anyone who will be shippingthose materials either for initial use or for disposal. In this publication the hazard class/division for each chemical listed in Table 3, \"Hazardous Chemicals ReferenceTable,\" is noted in the column titled Label. The hazard groups include explosives, combustible liquids, compressedgases, corrosives, flammable gases, flammable liquids,flammable solids, and poisons. Excerpts from the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 49, Chapter 1 (October 1, 1993, edition), defining those groups are as follows: 173.50. Class 1\u2014Definitions (a) Explosive. . . . An explosive means any substance or article, including a device, which is designed to function byexplosion (i.e., an extremely rapid release of gas and heat)or which, by chemical reaction within itself, is able tofunction in a similar manner even if not designed to functionby explosion. . . . (b) Explosives in Class 1 are divided into six divisions as follows: (1) Division 1.1 consists of explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is one which affectsalmost the entire load instantaneously. (2) Division 1.2 consists of explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion hazard. (3) Division 1.3 consists of explosives that have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projectionhazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard. (4) Division 1.4 consists of explosives that present a minor explosion hazard. The explosive effects are largelyconfined to the package and no projection of fragments ofappreciable size or range is to be expected. An external firemust not cause virtually instantaneous explosion of almostthe entire contents of the package. (5) Division 1.5 consists of very insensitive explosives. This division is comprised of substances which have a massexplosion hazard but are so insensitive that there is verylittle probability of initiation or of transition from burning todetonation under normal conditions of transport. (6) Division 1.6 consists of extremely insensitive articles which do not have a mass explosive hazard. Thisdivision is comprised of articles which contain only ex- tremely insensitive detonating substances and whichdemonstrate a negligible probability of accidental initiationor propagation. . . . 173.115.

(b) Division 2.2 (Nonflammable, Nonpoisonous Compressed Gas\u2014including compressed gas, liquefied gas,pressurized cryogenic gas, and compressed gas in solution). . . means any material (or mixture) which\u2014 (1) Exerts in the packaging an absolute pressure of 280 kPa (41 psi) at 20 \u00b0C (68\u00b0F), and (2) Does not meet the definition of Division 2.1 or 2.3.(c) Division 2.3 (Gas poisonous by inhalation) . . . means a liquid having a flash point of not more than 60.5 \u00b0C (141\u00b0F), or any material in a liquid phase with a flash point at or above 37.8 \u00b0C (100\u00b0F). (b)(1). . . a combustible liquid means any liquid that does not meet the definition of any other hazard classspecified in this subchapter and has a flash point above60.5\u00b0C (141\u00b0F) but below 93 \u00b0C (200\u00b0F). . . . (2) A flammable liquid with a flash point at or above 38\u00b0C (100\u00b0F) that does not meet the definition of any other hazard class . . . (c) Flash point. ( 1) Flash point means the minimum temperature at which a liquid gives off vapor within a testvessel in sufficient concentration to form an ignitablemixture with air near the surface of the liquid. . . . 173.124. Class 4, Divisions 4.1, 4.2, and Division 4.1 ( Flammable Solid ) . . . means any of the following three types of materials: (1) Wetted explosives that\u2014(i) When dry are explosives of Class l other than those of compatibility group A which are wetted with sufficientwater, alcohol, or plasticizer to suppress explosive proper-ties; and 162163 Appendix N (ii) Are specifically authorized by name either in the section 172.101 table or have been assigned a shippingname and hazard class by the Associate Administrator forHazardous Materials Safety under the provisions of\u2014 (A) An exemption issued under subchapter A of this chapter; or (B) An approval issued under section 173.56(i) of this part.

Strict observance of the regulations ismandatory. All students in the school district are to followthese regulations, rather than any conflicting instructions intextbooks or laboratory manuals. Students and parents are to read the regulations, sign the form, and return the form to the instructor. This proce- dure must be completed before a student can begin anylaboratory activity. The student should keep a copy of theregulations in his or her notebook for future reference. General 1. An instructor must be present during the performance of all laboratory work. 2. Prepare for each laboratory activity by reading all instructions before coming to class. Follow all direc-tions implicitly and intelligently. Make a note of anymodification in procedure given by the instructor. 3. Always approach laboratory experiences in a serious and courteous manner. 4. Use only those materials and equipment authorized by the instructor. Any science project or individuallyplanned experiment must be approved by the teacher. 5. Know the proper fire- and earthquake-drill procedures. 6. Roll long sleeves above the wrist. Long, hanging necklaces, bulky jewelry, and excessive and bulkyclothing should not be worn in the laboratory. 7. Confine long hair during a laboratory activity. 8. Wear shoes that cover the toes, rather than sandals, in the laboratory. 9. Wear appropriate eye protection, as directed by the instructor, whenever you are working in the laboratory.Safety goggles must be worn during hazardousactivities involving caustic/corrosive chemicals,heating of liquids, and other activities that may injurethe eyes. 10. Splashes and fumes from hazardous chemicals present a special danger to wearers of contact lenses. There-fore, students should preferably wear regular glasses(inside splash-proof goggles, when appropriate) duringall class activities or purchase personal splash-proofgoggles and wear them whenever exposure to chemi- cals or chemical fumes is possible. 11. Place books, purses, and such items in the designated storage area. Take only laboratory manuals andnotebooks into the working area. 12. Report any accident to the teacher immediately, no matter how minor, including reporting any burn,scratch, cut, or corrosive liquid on skin or clothing. 13. Students with open skin wounds on hands must wear gloves or be excused from the laboratory activity. 14. Eating or drinking in the laboratory or from laboratory equipment is not permitted. 15. Students are not permitted in laboratory storage rooms or teachers' workrooms without the approval of theteacher. Handling Equipment 16. Inform the teacher immediately of any equipment not working properly. 17. Report broken glassware, including thermometers, to the instructor immediately. 18. Operate electrical equipment only in a dry area and with dry hands. 19. When removing an electrical plug from its socket, pull the plug, not the electrical cord. 20. When heating material in a test tube, do not look into the mouth of the tube or point it in the direction of anyperson during the process. 21. When working with lasers or apparatus that produce X rays, microwaves, or ultraviolet rays, make certain thatproper shielding and other precautions are used. 22. Know the location and operation of the emergency shower, eyewash and facewash fountain, fire blanket,fire extinguisher, fire alarm box, and exits. 23. Light gas burners only as instructed by the teacher. Be sure no volatile materials (such as alcohol or acetone)are being used nearby. 24. Use a burner with extreme caution. Keep your head and clothing away from the flame and turn it off whennot in use. 167168Appendix P 25. Use a fire blanket to extinguish any flame on a person (see \"stop, drop, and roll\" procedure in Chapter 2,section C). 26. Use the fume hood whenever noxious, corrosive, or toxic fumes are produced or released. 27. To cut small-diameter glass tubing, use a file or tubing cutter to make a deep scratch. Wrap the tubing in apaper towel before breaking the glass away from youwith your thumbs. Fire polish all ends. 28. When bending glass, allow time for the glass to cool before further handling. Hot and cold glass have thesame visual appearance. Determine whether an objectis hot by bringing the back of your hand close to theobject. 29. Match hole size and tubing when inserting glass tubing into a stopper. If necessary, expand the hole first byusing an appropriate size cork borer. Lubricate thestopper hole and glass tubing with water or glycerin toease insertion, using towels to protect the hand.Carefully twist (never push) glass tubing into stopperholes. Handling Chemicals 30. Check labels and equipment instructions carefully. Be sure correct items are used in the proper manner. 31. Be aware if the chemicals being used are hazardous. Know where the material safety data sheet (MSDS) isand what it indicates for each of the hazardous chemi-cals you are using. 32. Never pour reagents back into bottles, exchange stoppers of bottles, or lay stoppers on the table. 33. When diluting acids, always pour acids into water, never the reverse. Combine the liquids slowly whilestirring to distribute heat buildup throughout themixture. 34. Keep hands away from face, eyes, and clothes while using solutions, specimens, equipment, or materials inthe laboratory. 35. To treat a burn from an acid or alkali, wash the affected area immediately with plenty of running water. If theeye is involved, irrigate it at the eyewash stationwithout interruption for 15 minutes. Report the incidentto your instructor immediately.36. Never carry hot equipment or dangerous chemicals through a group of students. 37. Use a mechanical pipette filler (never the mouth) when measuring or transferring small quantities of liquidwith a pipette. 38. Never taste anything or touch chemicals with the hands unless specifically instructed to do so. 39. Test for odor of chemicals only by waving your hand above the container and sniffing cautiously from adistance. Cleanup and Disposal 40. Be sure all glassware is clean before use. Clean glassware thoroughly after use. Residue may causeerrors in new experiments or cause a violent reaction orexplosion. 41. Keep work areas clean. Floors and aisles should be kept clear of equipment and materials. 42. Clean up any spill on the floor or work space immedi- ately. 43. Dispose of laboratory waste as instructed by the teacher. Use separate, designated containers (not thewastebasket) for the following: Matches, litmus paper, wooden splints, tooth- picks, and so on Broken and waste glass Rags, paper towels, or other absorbent materials used in the cleanup of flammable solids orliquids Hazardous/toxic liquids and solids 44. Remove all broken glass from the work area or floor as soon as possible. Never handle broken glass with barehands; use a counter brush and dustpan. 45. Always clean the laboratory area before leaving. 46. Students and teacher wash hands with soap and water before leaving the laboratory area. Note: Persistent or willful violation of the regulations will result in the loss of laboratory privileges and possibledismissal from the class.

Activities involving the firing of rockets must be well planned. It is recommended that launchings be limited to nomore than ten rockets if an audience will be present. Onlyauthorized classes and clubs may engage in this kind ofactivity. Guidelines for the firing of model rockets on school sites are as follows: 1.Purpose. These regulations have been prepared for the purpose of establishing reasonable safety standards forthe testing and flying of model rockets. Model rocketsare classified as nonprofessional rockets that arepropelled by approved, commercially manufacturedsolid propellant engines. 2.Special permit. At least four weeks before the date selected for the firing of model rockets, the school shallsubmit a firing request to the responsible district office.A special permit shall be obtained from the firedepartment for a given period. (Usually, the firedepartment's policy is to issue such a permit to cover abrief time.) The permit is issued in the name of theschool administrator. The instructor shall comply withall safety standards and conduct the launching in amanner that is also acceptable to the school administra-tor. 3.Size of rockets. Rockets with a class A or smaller engine are strongly recommended. Configuration of therockets is not limited except for weight (four ounces[112 gm] with engine) and length (not less than teninches [25 cm] or greater than 15 inches [38 cm]). Therocket shall contain no metal parts. 4.Launch site standards. The following stipulations apply: a. The launch site shall consist of a firing area and a recovery area. The firing area shall be consideredthat area contained within a radius of 25 feet(8 m) from the location of the launching plat-form. The recovery area shall include the firingarea and shall be determined to be the minimumarea necessary in which to retrieve the launchedrocket. b. The minimum size of the launch site shall extend to a radius of at least 100 feet (30 m) from thefiring position. 170171 h. The person launching the rocket shall make all electrical connections at both the firing platformand the source of power. i.

The purpose of thisstatement is to place the problem in its proper perspectiveand to list precautions which we feel should be taken to helpprevent future outbreaks. On November 24, 1970, the Bureau of Communicable Disease Control, State Department of Public Health, wroteanthropology departments of California colleges thatsusceptible students and faculty were at risk of acquiringcoccidioidomycosis on archaeologic expeditions andsuggested that this risk be made known to all who mightparticipate in field work in areas in which the disease isendemic. Additional outbreaks of coccidioidomycosis have occurred in California among archaeology students sincethen. Illness rates have exceeded 50 percent in severalstudent groups, and serious disseminated diseases (whichrequired protracted hospitalization and treatment) occurredin a few instances. Outbreaks have continued to occur yearafter year at sites known to be contaminated with the fungalagent causing coccidioidomycosis. Coccidioidomycosis can be contracted by minimal exposure to dusty soil in contaminated areas. Almost all ofthe millions of people who are lifetime residents in theseareas eventually develop infection from, and a lifetimeimmunity to, the soil fungus. However, when groups of persons from noncontaminated areas enter contaminatedareas to engage in field activities which include excavation,particularly archaeological digging, a high infection andillness rate can result from a relatively brief exposure. Therefore, we recommend the following to all school programs engaged in any field work involving exposure to dusty soil in areas in which coccidioidomycosis is endemic: 1. No educational institution should require students or faculty to participate in field work in areas in whichcoccidioidomycosis is endemic. Alternative coursework should be considered to satisfy course require-ments. 2. Information on coccidioidomycosis should be made available to all prospective students and faculty.Recommended references should include at least thefollowing publications: a. Loofbourow, J. C., and D. Pappagianis. Coccid- ioidomycosis\u2014An Occupational Hazard forArchaeologists. Society for California Archaeol- ogy, Special Report No. 2, December, 1971. b.Coccidioidomycosis (or Valley Fever). Sacra- mento: California State Department of PublicHealth, 1969. 173APPENDIX T DISPOSAL OF EMPTY CONTAINERS The California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Section 66261.7, addresses the issue of contaminated containers and encourages recycling and other options for disposal of \"empty\" containers. Containers once filled with hazardous waste canbe disposed of as nonhazardous waste provided certain stipulations are met. Definition of empty container: 1. If the container was used to store a hazardous liquid, the container must be completely drained so that no liquid drips from the container when it is tilted or held upside down. 2. If the container was used to store a solid or nonpourable hazardous material (powders, sludges, grease, thick resins), the material must be completely scraped out, leaving no remaining buildup inside the container. 3. Aerosol containers are empty if the contents and pressure are completely dispensed; the spray mechanism is in place and is not defective; and the container is not a reactive waste (i.e., may explode).
