What is functional medicine? Functional medicine (FM) determines how and why illness occurs and works to restore health by addressing the underlying causes of disease, using a systems-oriented approach and engaging both patient and practitioner in a therapeutic partnership. It is a patient-centered, science based approached that empowers patients and practitioners to work together to promote optimal wellness, considering each patient's genetic, biochemical and lifestyle factors and leveraging that information to direct personalized treatment plans. What is integrative medicine? Integrative medicine (IM) is an approach to care, informed by evidence, that puts the patient at the center, and seeks to restore and maintain health and wellness by understanding the patient's unique set of circumstances and addressing the full range of physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and environmental influences that affect health. Providers use all healing sciences to facilitate the body's innate healing response, combining conventional medical treatments with other therapies that are shown to be safe and effective. Our Mission: To engage with and provide information on emerging, integrative aspects of health, leading with evidence-based medicine, clinical expertise and personal perspectives while encouraging self-nurturing practices for students. Our group aims to have monthly meetings with a featured speaker who will discuss a topic in functional or integrative medicine. We also offer meditation and yoga classes for CCOM students in addition to the activities within our regular meetings.
