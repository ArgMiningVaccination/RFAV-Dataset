With the near universality of strong healing magic and how cheaply it can be acquired, going to an actual doctor (with the Heal skill) is probably seems weird and kind of fringe. Just imagine:\"I went to see my doctor when I got sick.\" \"What? Why? Don't you know those never work? Why not see an actual cleric who actually heals you?\" (Original thought property of the party deathmachine and hugger extraordinaire, Murdut, who's player reads this sub. We were looking for a surgeon to do an implantation surgery in Iron Gods, and he thought of it.) EDIT:I acknowledge that mundane healing is effective in Pathfinder. It's not blatantly false like homeopathy, but in comparison, it looks puny alongside magical healing. "}
