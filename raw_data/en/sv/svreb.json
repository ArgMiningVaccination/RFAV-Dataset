The fly leaf read likes this, \"Are you aware that the overwhelming majority of what you e at everyday is poisoning you? Are you aware that the overwhelming majority of what you see on TV, in movies, and what you hear from our culture, is poisoning your faith? God has given us supernatural cures for our destructive lives, for our fears! 1 John 5:4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world \u2014our faith. 1 1) \"Rhema Word Supplement.\" God's Word builds up our Faith. It is the Vitamin C of Faith... three weeks ago Hebrews 4: 12 For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two -edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart . o There are two words for Word of God. o The word used here is \"logos.\" Which commonly indicates the expression of a complete idea and it is 1 The New King James Version . 1982 (1 Jn 5:4). Nashville: Thomas Nelson. used of all of scripture . The Word of God is the \"words of God\" to us. They are the logos, the living, active, growing, d ynamic \"said Word of God\" to us Turn t o Romans 10:17 So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. o The other word used for Word is found here, and don't miss this, it's the word \"rhema.\" o The \"Rhema of God\" brings faith. Rhema is the specific word to you! o Logos is the \"Said Word of God,\" but Rhema is the \"Saying Word of God,\" rhema is the living nature of the Spirit flowing through the pages of scripture o This is when the Promises of God become A Promise from God to your situation o As we go through dilemmas of l ife, disease and sickness, maybe even death, the promises and love of God must become specific and centered on your issue \u2014the logos becomes the rhema o \"Faith comes\" this is the coming of faith through the Word of God as you read, listen, meditate on, and think about the meaning of a promise Jude 20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit 2) \"Spirit Prayer Supplement\" Praying in the Spirit builds up our Faith Faith is built up through prayer, prayer that is led and empowered by the Holy Spirit. o Listen\u2014everyone prays. I'm willing to wager, when times get tough and emergencies come, even atheists pray o Some prayer is not led by the Spirit! o Some prayer is not empowered by the Spirit! o Ex. ISIS in Iraq known as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant and Islamic State (IS).The aim of ISIS is to create an Islamic state across Sunni areas of Iraq and in Syria . These demonically inspired men are praying to Allah... o As Jesus disciples, your prayers are moving through Christ and Christ is interceding for us, on our behalf 1 John 4:4 For whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world \u2014our faith. 5 Who is he who overcomes the world, but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ? As we pray in the Spirit, in the power of the Spirit, Jesus is interceding for us... Our faith in Christ empowers us to pray in the Spirit You can pray in the Spirit daily Jude says, Jude 20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit What is \"praying in the Spirit?\" 3 aspects 1) Praying in the Spirit is Jesus prompting us and praying through us in our weakness Romans 8:26 Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. 27 Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God. 28 And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. The Holy Spirit prays through us as we seek God's will. We must seek God's will on matters of our life Ex. I take prayer walks and call out to God... This kind of prayer can be praying in our own language, in our own tongue, sharing our heart with God Prayer empowered by the Spirit is letting Christ take over my prayers. Asking him to pray through me ! Prayer prompted by the Spirit 2) Praying in t he Spirit can be through an Unknown Tongue, a Prayer Language that the Spirit supernaturally gives you 1 Cor. 14: 2 For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries. 1 Cor 14:14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. Ex. I received a spiritual prayer language many years ago in Okinawa, Japan after seeking God for that gift or many days... Praying in the Spirit with a heavenly language has often been called a Baptism in the Spirit and for many it is For others who are filled with the Spirit \u2014obeying and joyfully following Christ, it is an additional weapon in your arsenal of battle It builds intimacy with Christ \u2014allowing him to pray through us when our human language is inadequate... 3) Praying in the Spirit is the prayer of intimacy, coming close to your father Romans 8:15 For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, \"Abba, Father.\" 2 The prayer of \"Abba Father\" of crying out to our daddy! Intimacy with the Lord \u2014knowing that he knows your heart, you pour out your heart to him This builds up our faith! Our faith is strengthened as we pray in the \"Abba Father\" intimacy of the Spirit You are beloved, adopted, it's the prayer of adoption, the power to cry out to God in the dark night of the soul... 2 The New King James Version . 1982 (Ro 8:15). Nashville: Thomas Nelson. If you are longing for a deeper prayer life, a deeper intimacy with Jesus, come forward... "}
