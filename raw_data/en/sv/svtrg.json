The r e l a t i o n s h i p b e t w e e n d a i l y s t r e s s , presleep arousal, and sleep was investigated and ad ditionally, the association between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and psychophysiologica l stress response was analysed. Daily stress and prelseep arousal are well-known fa ctors in the development of sleep disturbances and insomnia. The article daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep in health y young women: a daily life computerized sleep diary and actigraphy study aimed to further elucidate the mediating role of presleep arousal in the relationship between daily stress and sleep. Subjective sleep quality and actigraphic sle ep efficiency were investigated both within- and between-participants. Multilevel modelling was applied on electronically assessed data comprising 14 consecutive nights in 145 healthy you ng women. The relationship between daily stress and worsened subjective sleep quality was mediated by somatic arousal on the between-participant level, and by cognitive arousal o n t h e w i t h i n - p a r t i c i p a n t s l e v e l . Unexpectedly, healthy young women showed higher act igraphic sleep efficiency following days with above average stress and somatic arousal. I t w a s c o n c l u d e d , t h a t h e a l t h y y o u n g women might even be able to compensate for days wit h above average levels of stress and arousal, which suggests further exploration of the mechanism causing this potentially adaptive regulation. ACEs have been associated with alterations of psych obiological stress systems and various negative health outcomes. Studies on health y participants are still scarce, however, attenuated endocrine and cardiovascular stress reac tivity in relation to childhood adversity has been observed. Therefore, the article blunted endocrine and cardiovascular reactivity in young healthy women reporting a history of childhoo d adversity a i m e d t o r e p l i c a t e t h e attenuated endocrine and cardiovascular stress reac tivity in association with ACEs in 104 healthy young women. Furthermore, the association b etween stress reactivity and duration, as well as age of occurrence of ACEs was investigated. P a r t i c i p a n t s u n d e r w e n t p s y c h o s o c i a l stress testing and free saliva cortisol and heart r ate were assessed. Results confirmed that a higher number of ACEs was associated with a blunted e n d o c r i n e a n d c a r d i o v a s c u l a r s t r e s s response to the psychosocial stress task, and that especially longer duration and occurrence before menarche of ACEs were significantly associat ed with attenuated cortisol response. It was concluded that ACEs, particularly if they occur red repeatedly or chronically, show an association with blunted stress reactivity in healt hy young women. 9 The article a d v e r s e c h i l d h o o d e x p e r i e n c e s a r e a s s o c i a t e d w i t h blunted sympathetic stress responsivity in healthy young women aimed at clarifying the role of the sympathetic an d parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous s ystem in the relationship between ACEs and blunted heart rate response. Systolic blood pre ssure (SBP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) were assessed during baseline and psychosocial stress testing in 129 healthy young women as measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular activity, respectively. Higher number of ACEs was c orrelated with blunted SBP stress reactivity but not with RSA reactivity after contro lling for respiratory rate. Also, earlier age of occurrence of ACEs was associated with blunted SBP reactivity on a trend level. In conclusion, childhood adversity was associated with d o w n - r e g u l a t i o n o f s y m p a t h e t i c s t r e s s responsivity but no alteration of parasympathetic f unctioning in adulthood. Future research will need to clarify whether this indicates a risk for negative health outcomes or might even be a sign of adaptive stress resistance. 10 1. Theoretical Background The aim of the present dissertation is to contribut e to the knowledge about different aspects of stress and their impact on healthy young women. Fir st of all, an overview of stress as an important factor concerning health and general well -being is given and different kinds of stressors are shortly described. In a next step, th e most important facts about sleep disturbances, including their development as well a s means of measurements will be outlined and stress as an essential precipitating factor in insomnia and sleep disturbances will be discussed. Finally, an introduction in the human st ress system will be given and the potential of stress in the form of adverse childhood experien ces (ACEs) to alter human stress response, as well as subsequent health consequences, will be outlined. 1.1. Stress The term stress is derived from the Latin words stringere ( t o d r a w t i g h t ) a n d strictus (compressed; Online Dictionary, 2014). After being formerly used in a physical context, it was introduced into medicine and was considered to be a factor of bad health. In 1936 Hans Seyle prominently used the term for a physical stat e, which he called General Adaptation Syndrome, and included diverse changes of physiolog ical processes in reaction to any form of potentially threatening stimuli (Lazarus & Folkman, 1 9 8 4 ) . T o d a y , a n i m p o r t a n t a n d m o s t influential concept is the concept of homeostasis, which assumes that organisms function owing to a complex and dynamic equilibrium (homeost asis), including the balanced cooperation and interactions of a wide range of phy sical, behavioural, and mental processes (Chrousos & Gold, 1992; McEwen, 1998). In this cont ext, stress is defined as a state of coping with all kinds of internal or external stres sors which K\u00fcbler, 2013) . Therefore, successful adaptive responses are necessary in order to counteract the effects of stressors, to maintain or re- establish homeostasis, and to assure survival of th e individual and the species (Chrousos, 2009). This functional adaptation in response to st ressors (including the ANS as well as the HPA axis) is often referred to as allostasis (or st ability through change; Sterling & Eyer, 1988). It is thought to provide effective coping an d re-establishment of homeostasis as long as the adaptive systems are turned on and off efficien tly and appropriately in terms of both magnitude, and duration. Exceeding, prolonged or ch ronic activation of allostatic systems potentially leads to failure of their adaptive func tion because they may become over-reactive, fail to shut of, or because they may fail to respon d (Chrousos, 2009; McEwen, 1998). These 11 physiological costs can lead to disease and negativ e health outcomes and were therefore referred to as allostatic load (or the price of ada ptation; !McEwen, 1998). 1.1.1. Different kinds of stress The range of possible events, situations or conditi ons, which could constitute a potential stressor is vast and can include physical as well a s emotional threats (Chrousos, 2009). Also, there are large individual differences concerning t he perception and appraisal of potentially stressful events or situations, and how severe they a r e s u b j e c t i v e l y p e r c e i v e d , a s w e l l a s concerning the selection of coping strategies (Ehle rt et al., 2013; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) Situations, which are perceived to be novel and sig nificant, but unpredictable or uncontrollable for the individual do have the poten tial to constitute especially intensive stressors according to Mason (1968). Life events, s uch as severe illness or significant losses (e.g., death, divorce, work loss), are often descri bed as major stressors, while minor stressors are usually thought to appear with higher frequency a n d m o r e l i k e ly o n a d a i ly ba s i s ( e .g . , arguments, time pressure, work demands; Brantley, W aggoner, Jones, & Rappaport, 1987). Further, a differentiation can be made in terms of duration between acute or time-limited, versus long-term or chronic stressors, which cause prolonged stimulation of the stress systems. Both acute, as well as chronic stressors c an vary in their severity and intensity: Acute stressors could range from daily hassles (such as t he above mentioned minor stressors), exams, and artificially induced laboratory stress t o personally significant events, such as the birth of a child or work loss, to the point of seve re and life-threatening events. Long-term or chronic stressors are usually associated with long- lasting high work demands or pressure, poverty, chronic illness, childhood neglect, but al so with repeated adversity, such as physical or sexual abuse, or war captivity (Ehlert et al., 2 013). The examples at the severe end of those spectrums represent a special case of stress, namel y the incidence of trauma, which includes exposure to actual or threatened death, serious inj ury or sexual violation of one self or another person involved, and is associated with immense fea r, horror, and helplessness as well as a risk for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; DSM-I V; Sass, 2003). 1.1.2. The impact of stress Despite the fact, that stressors can vary according to situational as well as individual factors, and therefore cannot be absolutely defined or opera tionalized, their impact seems to be almost inconceivable. Stress is one of the most omnipresen t topics in western societies and one of the most frequently named reasons for impaired subjecti ve wellbeing. As a well-known example, work stress and its consequences are associated wit h tremendous costs due to absenteeism, 12 turnover, diminished productivity as well as medica l, legal, and insurance expenses (APA Practice Organization, 2010). In Switzerland, a nat ional survey examining work-related stress in 2010 showed that 52.4% of working people reporte d having stress sometimes , while 34.4% reported suffering from stress at a frequent or very frequent b a s i s , w h i c h c o n s t i t u t e d a n increase by 22.7% compared to a survey conducted te n years earlier (Grebner, Berlowitz, Alvarado, & Cassina, 2011). In addition to the subject of work stress and the f requent subjective association of stress with a vast array of issues in our populatio n, stress officially constitutes a potential preceding or causing factor in the models of a vari ety of psychiatric disorders such as insomnia, PTSD or depression (Espie, 2002; Hautzing er, 1997; Sass, 2003). Also, research has confirmed stress to be associated not only with a v a r i e t y o f m a j o r n e g a t i v e h e a l t h outcomes but also with potential causes of death, s uch as cardiovascular disease, depression, immune dysfunction or HIV progression (Cohen, Janic ki-Deverts, & Miller, 2007; Glaser & Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005; Marin et al., 2011). Especial ly stress in childhood, often referred to as early adversity, childhood adversity, early live st ress (ELS), or ACEs, has been shown to constitute an important risk factor for the develop ment and persistence of mental and physical health problems often conceptualized as stress-rela ted disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune disorders, as well as earlier mortality from a range of diseases (Felitti et al., 1998; Gilbert et al., 2009; Wegman & Stetler, 2009). Childhood adversity has been pronounced a ma jor public health problem and according to the US Department of Health and Human services, approximately 3.8 million children were subject of at least one report of sus pected maltreatment in 2012, and 678'810 victims of child abuse and neglect were confirmed. Most common forms of reported maltreatment included neglect, and sexual, as well as physical abuse (U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2013). One mechanism, wh ich has been suggested as a cause for higher vulnerability to stress-related disorders, a re changes in the functioning of stress response systems due to repeated or long-lasting AC Es or trauma (Chrousos, 2009; McEwen, 1998). In summary, exceeding or prolonged exposure to stre ss, especially in early life, is known to be able to alter stress response systems i n humans, which constitutes a risk for future negative health consequences. Additionally, stressful live-events or increased daily stress in adulthood do also have the potential to c ontribute to the development of impairment and health outcomes, such as, for example, sleep di sorders or sleep disturbances. 13 1.2. Sleep Sleep is considered to be an essential process conc erning the physiological as well as psychological regeneration of our organism. It is n owadays agreed that sleep constitutes an active condition of recovery, and is associated wit h brain activity, which cannot be interpreted as a passive state of rest as earlier believed. Thi s concept is supported by the fact that sleep is associated with specific changes in central and aut onomic nervous systems, as well as various hormonal processes. One example for the beneficial effects of sleep is the stimulation of important cognitive functions, such as memory conso lidation (Morin, 1993; Saletu, of the most well-known examples of changes in brain activity and other body functions during sleep is the altern ation of slow-wave sleep phases and stages of rapid eye movement sleep (REM-sleep). While slow -wave sleep phases dominate during the beginning of the night, REM-sleep increases tow ards the end of the night. Slow-wave sleep is characterized by low tonicity and little e ye movements, while REM-sleep evidently is associated with rapid eye movements, but also with increased body movement and vivid dreaming (Saletu, 2004). It is difficult to define good o r normal s l e e p . A l t h o u g h a n a v e r a g e s l e e p t i m e o f approximately 7-8 hours, a sleep efficiency of 85% or above, and a sleep latency of up to 30 minutes are usually considered to indicate good sle ep, there are large individual differences, which can vary with age, gender, environmental, and p s y c h o l o g i c a l f a c t o r s . ( R \u00f6 s c h k e & Mann, 1998; Saletu, 2004). Sleep loss or severe dis ruptions of sleep are associated with impaired homeostasis and can lead to significant im pairment of psychological and cognitive functions, such as impaired concentration and perfo rmance, sleepiness and fatigue, as well as mood alterations (Bonnet & Arand, 2010; Horne, 1985 ). Sleep can be disturbed in a variety of ways. The current International Classification of S leep Disorders (ICSD-3; American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), 2014) includes se ven categories of sleep disorders: insomnia, sleep related breathing disorders, centra l disorders of hypersomnolence, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, sleep rel ated movement disorders, and other sleep disorders. Even below the threshold of clinically r elevant and officially diagnosed sleep disorders, there is a wide range of phenomena, whic h are commonly associated with terms such as sleep disruptions, sleep disturbances, o r impaired sleep . The present dissertation aimed at contributing to the knowledge about the im pact of stressful daily experiences on sleep in healthy young women. Therefore, the above mentioned sleep disturbances on a non- clinical level, such as impaired sleep efficiency o r worse subjective sleep quality, played an important role in our sample. Because subclinical s leep disturbances or accompanying factors 14 (e.g. arousal) are often considered to be a precedi ng factor of sleep disorders, such as insomnia (Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2010; Jansson & Linton, 2006; Morin, 1993), and since it contributes to the understanding of the developm ent of sleep disturbances, a short introduction into insomnia and the knowledge about its cause and maintenance will be given in the next paragraph. 1.2.1. Insomnia Insomnia is described as a disorder with a deprivat ion of sleep quantity or efficiency due to either difficulty of getting asleep, frequent awake ning during the night, or awaking very early in the morning. Very often it is accompanied by the s u b j e c t i v e f e e l i n g o f i m p a i r e d s l e e p quality (Morin, 1993). Daytime fatigue, exhaustion, i m p a i r e d f u n c t i o n i n g , l a c k o f concentration, and mood disturbances are also commo nly reported (Bonnet & Arand, 2010; Morin, 1993). The deprivation of sleep has been ver ified by polysomnography (PSG), showing prolonged sleep latency, higher number of n octurnal awakenings, as well as reduced sleep efficiency in patients with insomnia (Perlis, G e h r m a n , T e r z a n o , C o t e , & R i e m a n n , 2010). Still, it has to be mentioned, that patients s u f f e r i n g f r o m i n s o m n i a d o h a v e t h e tendency to underestimate their sleep quantity (Mea ns, Edinger, Glenn, & Fins, 2003; Perlis et al., 2010). Two common factors, which are usually a ssociated with insomnia and sleep disturbances, are stress and arousal. Many conceptu al or integrative models name both, the occurrence of stressful preceding events (e.g. dail y hassles, life-events, or changes in sleep- wake balance), as well as the occurrence of so-call ed hyperarousal as core features of insomnia (Espie, 2002; Morin, 1993). Concerning the relationship between hyperarousal and sleep, theories postulate that physiological or cog nitive arousal before bedtime is detrimental for sleep, and contributes to the worsening of slee p problems. Cognitive arousal consists of intrusive cognitions experienced as being uncontrol lable, while physiological or somatic arousal is described as the perception of vegetativ e arousal (e.g., elevated heart rate, sweating; Nicassio, Mendlowitz, Fussell, & Petras, 1985). In his integrative model, Morin (1993) indicated that the balance between sleep and wakefu lness is regulated by the amount of arousal, and only low levels of arousal are compati ble with sleep. Espie (2002) further proposed that particularly the inhibition of de-aro usal processes leads to the development of insomnia. Subsequently, dysfunctional cognitions ab out sleep, such as worrying about sleep loss, unhelpful believes, ensuing maladaptive copin g strategies (e.g. prolonging bedtimes, daytime napping), and fear of sleeplessness every n ight, even enhance psychophysiological arousal and lead to the maintenance of the disorder ( H a r v e y , 2 0 0 2 ) . A l s o , f o l l o w i n g t h e principles of conditioning, the sleep environment i s believed to become a conditioned 15 stimulus, creating conditioned arousal and sleeples sness, which further contributes to the development and maintenance of insomnia (Bootzin, 1 972). The point prevalence of primary insomnia is estimat ed to lie between 2% and 6%, though self-reported sleep disturbances in healthy populations range up to more than 40% (Hajak, 2001; Ohayon, 2002), which makes sleep dist urbances a widely prevalent and momentous health problem in the general population. The impact of insomnia and other sleep disturbances is known to be severe and includes red uced quality of life and well-being as well as impaired daytime-functioning and working ability , and thus is a potential risk factor for subsequent health problems (Hajak, 2001; Kyle, Morg an, & Espie, 2010). Accordingly, insomnia and sleep difficulties are associated with increased work absenteeism and healthcare costs (Ohayon, 2002; Stoller, 1994). 1.2.2. Measurement of sleep Besides frequently used subjective measures of slee p, polysomnography (PSG) is the most objective method in sleep assessment. With the usua lly combined instruments of electroencephalography (EEG), additional measur es such as respiration, electrocardiography (ECG), and oxygen saturation, i t is possible to accurately identify sleep stages, as well as sleep duration, sleep efficiency , sleep latency, and different parameters of REM-periods (Rechtschaffen & Kales, 1968). Due to t he necessity of being attached to electrodes and thereby to various equipment, PSG is usually conducted in sleep laboratories and is therefore accompanied by significant effort and financial costs. Another possibility to measure sleep is the use of actigraphy or actigraph ic sleep measures, which is a non-invasive method for recording motor activity. An actigraph i s a small device, usually looking similar to a wrist watch, which is carried on the non-dominant a r m . I t i s c a p a b l e o f d e t e c t i n g a r m movement through the use of an accelerometer and th erefore represents a useful instrument for detecting rhythms of motor calm as well as acti vity during day and night (Ancoli-Israel et al., 2003). By the use of algorithms, it is possibl e to detect rates of movement, which are representative of sleep or wakefulness. Therefore, actigraphy is a useful instrument for detecting sleep-wake cycles under conditions of dai ly life and has been shown to provide accurate estimates of global sleep parameters (Anco li-Israel et al., 2003; Sadeh, 2011). It represents an unobtrusive technique with relatively low effort and costs but compared to PSG bears the disadvantage of not being able to detect sleep stages as well as sleep depth. 16 1.3. Stress, arousal and sleep Various psychological factors, such as stress, dail y hassles, rumination, and hyperarousal have been found to play an essential role in the develop ment of sleep disturbances (Guastella et al., 2010), but the search for the specific roles and interplay among these factors is still ongoing. As mentioned above, stress is one of the most common and well-known antecedents o f insomnia and has been associated with impaired sleep in a variety of ways. Major str essors (e.g. life events) repeatedly have been found to occur with greater incidence in the t ime preceding the onset of insomnia or to be associated with increased risk for the developme nt of sleep problems (e.g. Bastien, Vallieres, & Morin, 2004; Vahtera et al., 2007). Es pecially traumatic events have repeatedly been linked to the development of sleep disorders, which even constitute a core symptom of PTSD (Harvey, Jones, & Schmidt, 2003; Spoormaker & Montgomery, 2008). But even minor stressors have been associated with more disturbed sleep (Jansson & Linton, 2006; Kashani, Eliasson, & Vernalis, 2012). Additionally, long-ter m stressors, such as childhood adversities, have been found to predict sleep problems several y ears later (e.g. Bader, Schafer, Schenkel, Nissen, & Schwander, 2007; Greenfield, Lee, Friedma n, & Springer, 2011; Gregory, Caspi, Moffitt, & Poulton, 2006). On a more acute daily ba sis, the experience of acute stress during the day is associated with impaired sleep the follo wing night (e.g. Bader, Bauer, Christen, & Schafer, 2011; Sadeh, Keinan, & Daon, 2004). Based on the theoretical frameworks mentioned above , various studies tested the association between arousal and sleep and have conf irmed that hyperarousal plays a major role in insomnia and sleep disturbances: high arous al is more prevalent in poor than in good sleepers and can be measured on various physiologic al levels, such as sympathetic nervous system activation, hormone secretion, and high-freq uency EEG activation (Bonnet & Arand, 2010; Riemann et al., 2010). In addition to the hig her prevalence of arousal in insomniacs, there is evidence that high physiological and cogni tive arousal also are prevalent in healthy populations and might constitute a preceding factor i n t h e d e v e l o p m e n t o f s l e e p d i s o r d e r s (Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2010; Jansson-Fr\u00f6jmark & L i n t o n , 2 0 0 8 ) . E v e n d e l i b e r a t e l y induced stress in the laboratory and the following increase in arousal at bedtime acutely worsen sleep in both poor and good sleepers (Hall e t al., 2004; Wuyts et al., 2012). Empirical studies in healthy young samples on the r elationship between stress and sleep on a day-to-day basis using within-participan t data measured over time are still scarce. Garde, Albertsen, Persson, Hansen, and Rugulies (20 11) found evidence for a bidirectional association between stress and sleep, indicating a self-reinforcing vicious circle: in a 17 representative sample of the Danish population, hig her ratings of stress at bedtime were associated with ratings of poor sleep the following night. In addition, higher ratings of poor sleep in the morning were associated with higher ra tings of stress during the subsequent day. In a study by Hanson and Chen (2010), the daily num ber of stressors reported by healthy young adults was associated with decreased subseque nt sleep time when moderated by family risk. Akerstedt et al. (2012) studied the relations hip between stress and sleep over a period of 6 weeks in 50 healthy adults. They found bedtime st ress and worries to be the two main predictors of subjective sleep quality. Still, the potentially mediating effect of arousal between stress and sleep was not tested in those studies. Morin et al. (2003) tested the relationship between a l l t h r e e v a r i a b l e s a n d f o u n d a significant relationship between daytime stress and n i g h t - t i m e s l e e p , w i t h p r e s l e e p a r o u s a l playing a mediating role. The authors collected pro spective daily paper and pencil measures for 21 consecutive days in men and women aged 19-60 y e a r s , a n d i n c l u d e d b o t h , p e r s o n s suffering from insomnia as well as good sleepers. D ata showed that subjective stress during the day was a significant predictor of self-reporte d subjective sleep quality the following night for both groups and higher levels of presleep arous al mediated this relationship. Objective sleep measures were not used in this study. 1.4. The human stress system The endocrine system and the autonomic nervous syst em (ANS) with their central and peripheral components are key players in orchestrat ing bodily stress responses in cases where the functioning of our organism is threatened by in ternal or external stressors. Besides cognitive changes, such as enhanced attention, aler tness, as well as focus on perceived threat, increased cardiovascular tone and respiration, incr eased catabolism, and therefore adaptive redirection of energy to brain, heart, and skeletal muscles are central to a functioning stress response (Charmandari, Tsigos, & Chrousos, 2005; Ch rousos, At the same time, non-adaptive functions during acu te stress, such as reproduction and growth, are temporary suppressed (Chrousos & Gold, 1992). Importantly, the orchestration of stress responses requires a highly-integrated and w ell-coordinated connection between all involved systems, including not only the endocrine system, the ANS, and the central nervous system (CNS), but also the immune system. Therefore , these systems have the potential to initiate, reinforce, or inhibit each other by mutua l innervation, for example by central control systems in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and lo cus coeruleus (LC) (Tsigos & Herman, The thalamus, the amygdala, and the sensory cortex all play an important role in the detection and evaluation of potential threats and s tressors (Danese & McEwen, 2012). The amygdala is well known for its role in identifying environmental threats for survival and in linking external stimuli to defence reactions, whic h can lead to conditioned fear responses (LeDoux, 2003). It is under inhibitory control by t he hippocampus (based on learning processes and memory of previous experiences) and b y the prefrontal cortex (based on executive functions; Herman, Ostrander, Mueller, & Figueiredo, 2005; McEwen, 2007). If this combined network of brain areas detects a pote ntial threat of homeostasis by an occurring stressor, the above mentioned multi-layered stress response is induced. This includes the neuroendocrine response of the HPA axis, as well as t h e sy m p a t h e t i c a n d p a r a sy m p a t h e t i c branches of the ANS (Chrousos, 2009; Ulrich-Lai & H erman, 2009). 1.4.1. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axi s Concerning the endocrine system, exposure to stress c a u s e s a n i n c r e a s e d a c t i v a t i o n o f t h e HPA axis. It is initiated by firing in the paravent ricular nucleus (PVN) in (AVP), stimulate the secretion enocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary gland. ACTH travels through the blood stream and stimulates the adrenal cortex to produce glucocorticoid hormones ortisol Tsigos & Chrousos, 2002; Ulrich-Lai & Herman, 2009). Cortisol levels start t o rise approximately 5-20 minutes after stressor onset and peak levels occur about 10-30 mi nutes after the stressor is finished (Kirschbaum & Hellhammer, 2000). Main functions of cortisol are the insurance of a steady supply of glucose by strong catabolic action under stressful conditions, but also the improvement of cardiovascular tone, the prevention of an overshooting immune response to the stressor, as well as the shaping of future stre ss response through actions in the CNS (Danese & McEwen, 2012; Hellhammer, 2008; McCormick & M a t h e w s , 2 0 0 7 ) . B e s i d e s a wide range of stressors with the potential to activ ate the HPA axis, situations, which are perceived to be novel, unpredictable, uncontrollabl e, or to involve social-evaluative threat for the individual, have been shown to be especially ef fective in eliciting HPA responses (Dickerson & Kemeny, 2004; Mason, 1968). Apart from its role in stress response, the HPA axi s has a major function in regulating daily cortisol release according to a circadian rhy thm. During non-stressful conditions CRH, AVP, and subsequently ACTH and cortisol are secrete d in a pulsatile fashion and show peak levels in the early morning hours, approximately 30 minutes after awakening (Horrocks et al., 1990; Kirschbaum & Hellhammer, 2000). This response has been found to show high intra-19 individual stability over weeks and months if not d isturbed by changes in lightning, activity, diet, or stress (Kirschbaum & Hellhammer, 2000). As the final effector of the HPA axis, cortisol has not only the function to regulate but also to terminate HPA stress response by an inhibit ory feedback, which directly acts at all levels (hypothalamic centres, PVN and the pituitary gland) in order to prevent further CRH and AVP secretion. This negative feedback serves a protective mechanism by limiting the duration of total tissue exposure to glucocorticoid s (De Kloet, autonomic nervous system (ANS) The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasy mpathetic nervous system (PNS) of the ANS together regulate a wide range of functions, in cluding cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, and endocrine systems (Gil bey & Spyer, 1993; McCorry, 2007). ! Within seconds after the occurrence of a stressor, the ANS generates a fight-or-flight response pattern with corresponding physiological changes. I mportantly, a stress response in heart rate and other organismic functions is often comprised o f both, sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal. Therefore, both branche s of the ANS may play a role in regulating stress-induced arousal (Berntson, Caciop po, & Quigley, 1991; Chrousos & Gold, 1992). The sympathetic branch of the ANS is activated by a p r o l o n g e d a n d p o w e r f u l discharge from the locus coeruleus (LC) in the brai n stem once a stimulus is perceived as a threat. The SNS response is characterized by the re lease of catecholamines, such as epinephrine (EPI), and norepinephrine (NE). In the CNS the LC releases NE (therefore referred to as the LC-NE system), which enables the brain to higher alertness, attention, and arousal. In the periphery, SNS activation enhances cardiovascular and pulmonary function, induces constriction of blood vessels, and provides e n e r g y t o r e l e v a n t o r g a n s , t h e r e b y enabling the fight-or-flight reactions. This involv es postganglionic fibers releasing NE, as well as the stimulation of the adrenal medulla of t he adrenal gland, releasing mainly EPI, and is therefore referred the sympathetic/adrenom edullary system (SAM; Hellhammer, 2008; Ulrich-Lai & Herman, 2009). Sympathetic discharges occur with a variety of physical as well as psychological stressors but are also observed in dependent of fight and flight conditions as, for example, mental and physical work, or exposure to novel stimuli (Hellhammer, 2008). Sufficient blood supply to muscles and other organs d u r i n g s t r e s s r e s p o n d i n g i s assured by up-regulation of blood pressure. Particu larly systolic blood pressure (SBP) is known to be regulated almost exclusively by the sym patho-adrenal axis via beta-adrenergic 20 receptors and thus constitutes a putative index of sympathetic cardiovascular activity (Obrist, 1981; Silvestrini & Gendolla, 2011). The parasympathetic branch of the ANS serves an opp osing set of functions, promoting growth and restoration. It inhibits sympa thetic activation after stressful events and enables return to homeostasis but also facilitates initial sympathetic activation in threatening situations by withdrawing its inhibitory influence. I m p o r t a n t l y , t h e S N S u n d P N S d o n o t always operate in an antagonist fashion but may exh ibit independent activation (Berntson et al., 1991; Porges, 2007). Concerning cardiovascular a c t i v i t y , t h e P N S e x e r t s a n i n h i b i t o r y influence on heart rate via the vagus nerve, which originates in the brain stem and terminates at the sino-atrial node of the heart. This parasymp athetic control over heart rate is often referred to as vagal tone, regulating autonomic aro usal and promoting calm states (e.g. Porges, 2007). High cardiac vagal tone during state s of calm has been associated with higher physiological and behavioural flexibility as well a s with the ability of social engagement, while appropriate withdrawal (greater decrease) of vagal influence during threatening or demanding situations enables SNS mobilisation and c orresponding reaction (Fabes & Eisenberg, 1997; & Fredrickson, 2010; Porges, 2 007). Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) is often used as a n o n - i n v a s i v e i n d e x o f parasympathetic cardiovascular response. It refers to the rhythmic oscillation of heart rate linked to the phases of the respiratory cycle and i ndicates the efferent activity of the PNS innervating the heart, or cardiac vagal control. Sp ecifically, heart rate accelerates during inspiration and decelerates during expiration and t his systematic variability has been found to be influenced solely by vagal influence to the hear t, which decreases its influence during inspiration and reinstates during expiration. The a mplitude of RSA as an index of this variability therefore provides an estimate of gener al efficiency but also potential flexibility of cardiac vagal tone in regulating cardiovascular fun ctioning (Berntson et al., 1997; Grossman, Stemmler, & Meinhardt, 1990). Spectral analysis of heart rate variability over several minutes within the frequency range of 0.15-0.50 Hz (the fre quency band typically associated with respiration), has been established as the method of choice for quantifying RSA (Camm et al., 1996; Grossman et al., 1990). 1.5. Adverse childhood experiences and alterations in stress response As mentioned above, ACEs have been shown to constit ute an important risk factor for the development and persistence of mental and physical health problems often conceptualized as stress-related disorders (Felitti et al., 1998; Weg man & Stetler, 2009). These detrimental consequences of early adversity are supported by fi ndings from animal models showing 21 higher risk for pathology in association with early -live stress (Sanchez, Ladd, & Plotsky, 2001). Changes in the functioning of stress respons e systems due to exceeding, repeated, or long-lasting stressors, such as ACEs or trauma, hav e been suggested to be the cause for higher vulnerability to stress-related disorders. Current models assume that these stressors have the potential to alter patterns of endocrine and autono mic discharge in the long-term by disturbing the complex and integrated system of positive and n egative feedback-loops, thereby creating a state of allostatic load that potentially results i n adverse health outcomes (see for review: Chrousos, 2009; Heim & Nemeroff, 2001; McEwen, 1998 ; Miller, Chen, & Parker, 2011). Importantly, previous evidence and theoretical cons iderations suggest that allostatic load can take either the direction of failure to shut off th e stress response and a resulting chronic hyperactivity, but also the direction of failure to m o b i l i z e a f u l l r e s p o n s e a n d a r e s u l t i n g blunted pattern (Fries, Hesse, Hellhammer, & Hellha mmer, 2005; Lovallo, levels of endocrine and autonomic r e s p o n s e , t h e s e p r o c e s s e s c a n b e mediated or moderated by genetic predisposition and by epigenetic programming during early brain development. For example, genetic and epigene tic influences can lead to an alteration of relevant receptors in regulatory feedback loops (e. g. P\u00fctz, 2008; Tyrka, Price, Marsit, Walters, & Carpenter, 2012; Weaver et al., 2004). From a developmental perspective, age at stress exp osure is believed to be an important factor since there is evidence for develo pmental periods with high sensitivity for the formation of enduring alterations in stress respons 1 0 ) . D u r i n g p r e n a t a l a n d e a r l y postnatal life the brain grows rapidly and therefor e is characterized by high plasticity, which then slows down during childhood and adolescence (C harmandari, Kino, Souvatzoglou, & Chrousos, 2003). This implies, that events causing exceeding or prolonged stimulation of the stress system during these critical developmental p eriods could lead to lasting alterations in stress reactivity (Charmandari et al., 2003; Totten ham & Sheridan, 2010). I n a d e q u a t e l y i n c r e a s e d s t r e s s s y s t e m a c t i v i t y a n d responsiveness due to chronic and prolonged activation of the system, for example due t o d i s t u r b e d n e g a t i v e f e e d b a c k , m a y impair growth, development, and metabolism (Chrouso s, 2009). Hyper-secretion of CRH has been associated with depression, anxiety, substance a b u s e , a s w e l l a s e a t i n g d i s o r d e r s . Furthermore, disruptions of the HPA axis and the fu nctions of the SNS have been found in obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellit us, and the stimulation of noradrenergic nerves, accompanied by higher heart r ate reactions and increased levels of 22 catecholamines, have been associated with anxiety d ionally, enhanced plasma NE levels have been found to constitute an important risk fac tor for later life mortality and also, the risk of increased blood pressure (which is strongly prom oted by sympathetic outflow) for cardiovascular disease is well known (Gruenewald, S eeman, Ryff, Karlamangla, & Singer, 2006; Guyenet, 2006). Finally, some disorders with exceeding SNS activation were found to be associated with a parallel decrease in parasympa thetic functioning or vagal tone (low tonic RSA or inadequate RSA withdrawal), leading to auton omic imbalance (Friedman & Thayer, 1998; Giese-Davis et al., 2006; Thayer & Lane, 2007 ). On the other hand, decreased stress system activity and reactivity could compromise necessary psychobiological processes in response to stress. It is assumed that persistent hyper- activation or -reactivity of the stress system may ultimately lead to failure or down-regulation, for example due to a compensatory increase in negat ive feedback, and hence to a blunted response pattern, with the system not launching app ropriate reactions anymore (Fries et al., 2005; Miller, Chen, & Zhou, 2007). While it may be adaptive that the stress system shuts down the stress response in order to minimize the p otential dangers of chronic activation (Fries et al., 2005), chronically low stress system a c t i v i t y i s n e v e r t h e l e s s a s s o c i a t e d w i t h negative health outcomes: Decreased activity and re sponsiveness of the HPA axis has been associated with conditions such as chronic pain, ch ronic fatigue, atypical depression, fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid Fries et al., 2005; Heim, Ehlert, & Hellhammer, 2000). Additionally, depletion of NE st orage vesicles as a consequence of chronic stress is characterized by symptoms of pron ounced fatigue, cognitive impairment, such as lack of initiative and motivation, burnout, a s w e l l a s s y m p t o m s p r o m o t e d b y l o w sympathetic but high parasympathetic activity (Gold & C h r o u s o s , 2 0 0 2 ; K l i n g m a n n & Hellhammer, 2008). Importantly, on the CNS level, exceeding or chronic s t r e s s , i n c l u d i n g A C E s a n d associated alterations of stress response, have rep eatedly been associated with structural and functional abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, as well as with accompanying cognitive impairment in attent ion, memory function, and processes concerning fear conditioning (McEwen, 2007; McEwen & Gianaros, 2011). In addition to the above mentioned health outcomes, both catecholamines as well as glucocorticoids can induce quantitative and qualita tive changes in immune function. The immune system becomes activated in a wide range of stressful situation, resulting in a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Chrousos, 1995). The refore, immunosuppressive and anti-23 inflammatory effects of HPA and ANS activation (amo ngst others through a shift from cellular to humoral immunity) have the function to prevent an overshooting of immune response in order to restrain the inflammatory reac tion and protect the body from tissue destruction (Elenkov, Webster, Torpy, & Chrousos, 1 999; Hellhammer, 2008). Thus, excessive stress response due to chronic stress has b e e n a s s o c i a t e d w i t h i n c r e a s e d susceptibility to infectious agents but enhanced re sistance to autoimmune or inflammatory disease (Chrousos, 1995; Elenkov et al., 1999). Imp lications for health include infectious- disease risk, reactivation or progression of latent v i r u s e s , s uc h a s HI V or h e r pe s v i r u s e s , o r impaired wound healing (see for review: Glaser & Ki ecolt-Glaser, 2005). On the other hand, a defective stress response can thus lead to a disinh ibition of immune functions with prolonged inflammatory effects due to elevation of pro-inflam matory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha or interleukin-6, causing resistance t o infections but increased susceptibility to autoimmune or inflammatory disease, such as the abo ve mentioned chronic pain or rheumatoid arthritis (Chrousos, 1995; Heim, Ehlert, e t , 2 0 0 0 ) . S t i l l , t h o s e p r o c e s s e s a r e complex and stress might result in a wide range of changes in acute and chronic immunocompetence rather than a specific pattern of suppression or enhancement (Elenkov et al., 1999). As mentioned above, individual differences in funct ional as well as disrupted stress response depend on a multitude of factors, such as genetic disposition, as well as epigenetic programming in association with age at stress expos ure (e.g. Del Giudice, Ellis, & Shirtcliff, 2011; Weaver et al., 2004). Also, stress response i s influenced by gender, type of adversity, environmental, and protective factors, including se nsitive parenting, coping, positive affect, or social support (Bostock, Hamer, Wawrzyniak, Mitchel l, & Steptoe, 2011; Carpenter et al., 2007; McCormick & Mathews, 2007). Furthermore, stre ss response systems can be disturbed at different levels of their central and peripheral r e g u l a t o r y f e e d b a c k l o o p s ( H e l l h a m m e r , 2008; Klingmann & Hellhammer, 2008), and finally, d ue to interconnection, integration, and mutual innervation, the different arms of the stres s system have the potential to initiate, reinforce, or inhibit each other (Bauer, Quas, & Bo yce, 2002; Ulrich-Lai & Herman, 2009). Due to this amount of influencing factors, discrepa nt or seemingly opposite findings concerning activity and reactivity patterns of stre ss response have been observed (e.g. Kudielka, Hellhammer, & Wust, 2009; Miller et al., 2007). Further research is needed in order to integrate findings into a more consistent pictur e concerning the relationship between adversity, stress response alterations, and subsequ ent health outcomes. Therefore, the next section will concentrate on a brief introduction on the specific findings, which were relevant 24 for the conceptual design of the two articles on en docrine as well as sympathetic and parasympathetic stress response in healthy young wo men. 1.5.1. Findings regarding the HPA axis While PTSD in adults has been associated with basal hypo-activity of the HPA axis (see for review: Yehuda, 1997), different reactivity phenoty pe patterns have emerged in the context of ACEs and psychopathology with a number of studies s howing exaggerated al., 2000; Rao, Hammen, Ortiz, Chen, & Poland, 2008). For example, in patients with PTSD related to childhood abuse, cortisol levels in anticipation an d during a cognitive challenge were significantly higher than in controls (Bremner et a l., 2003). Also, Heim, Newport, Mletzko, Miller, and Nemeroff (2008) showed that woman with a history of childhood adversity in combination with major depressive disorder exhibite d increased cortisol responses to psychosocial stress compared to control groups, and furthermore, that a history of childhood abuse was the strongest predictor of ACTH responsiv eness. Still, in clinical samples, effects may be confounded with current psychiatric symptoms . In contrast to clinical samples, a growing number o f studies on healthy participants reported blunted endocrine stress responses in asso ciation with ACEs (Carpenter et al., 2007; Carpenter, Shattuck, Tyrka, Geracioti, & Sorocco, Cohoon, & Vincent, 2012). For example, Car penter et al. (2007) reported blunted plasma cortisol responses to a psychosocial stress test in a healthy sample with a history of ACEs compared to participants without a history of childhood maltreatment. Also, a recent study by Lovallo et al. (2012) showed diminished co rtisol as well as heart rate responses in a large sample of healthy participants with an increa sing number of adverse life events, indicating an inverse dose-response relationship of ACEs and reactivity to a mental stress test. 1.5.2. Findings regarding the ANS Since heart rate is regulated by both, sympathetic and parasympathetic efferent activity of the ANS, it remains unclear whether attenuated heart ra te reactivity, such as the above mentioned by Lovallo et al. (2012), is caused by sympathetic hyporeactivity or less parasympathetic withdrawal, or a combination of both (Berntson et a l., 1991). It is therefore important to clarify the role of the sympathetic (indexed by SBP ) and the parasympathetic (indexed by RSA) cardiovascular stress responsivity in associat ion with ACEs. Elevated tonic sympathetic activity has frequently been reported in samples with PTSD and persistent hyperarousal is considered to b e a core symptom of the disorder 25 (Blechert, Michael, Grossman, Lajtman, & Wilhelm, 2 007; Buckley & Kaloupek, 2001; Kirsch, Wilhelm, & Goldbeck, 2011). In non-clinical s a m p l e s , s i m i l a r l y e l e v a t e d t o n i c sympathetic activity has been found in association with adversity in some studies (Lee, Tsenkova, & Carr, 2014; Paulus, Argo, & Egge, 2013; S u e t a l . , 2 0 1 4 ) , w h i l e o t h e r s h a v e found no baseline differences in heart rate or SBP (Leitzke, Hilt, & Pollak, 2013; Lovallo et al., 2012). Concerning sympathetic stress reactivity, results a re mixed in samples with PTSD with either heightened (Heim, Newport, et al., 2000) or blunted heart rate or electrodermal responses to acute stress (Blechert et al., 2007; C ohen et al., 2000). In non-clinical samples, some studies have produced evidence for heightened SNS reactivity in response to stressors (Oosterman, de Schipper, Fisher, Dozier, & Schuenge l, 2010; Otte et al., 2005). On the other hand, the above mentioned study by Lovallo et al. ( 2012) showed diminished heart rate responses to a stress task with an increasing numbe r of adverse life events in a large sample of healthy participants (N=354). Also, Leitzke et al. (2013) found blunted SBP response in maltreated compared to non-maltreated youth (N=111) . Concerning adversity and parasympathetic regulation , there is evidence for lower tonic RSA in association with both, non-clinical samples with the experience of ACEs (Dale et al., 2009; Miskovic, Schmidt, Georgiades, Boyle, & MacMi llan, samples with PTSD (Blechert et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 1997). C oncerning RSA withdrawal in response to stressors, Cohen et al., (1998) found that in parti cipants with PTSD, RSA did not change from resting condition to trauma recall compared to a wi thdrawal of RSA in controls. In non- clinical samples, there is evidence for lower RSA s tress reactivity or lower recovery in the context of adversity (Arditi-Babchuk, Feldman, & Gi lboa-Schechtman, 2009; Dale et al., 2009). However, these patterns might be complicated b y d i f f e r e n t f a c t o r s , s u c h a s f a m i l y environment, mediating or moderating the relationsh ip between ACEs and RSA, especially in children and adolescents. Also, there is evidence t hat tonic RSA or RSA stress reactivity themselves constitute moderating factors between ea rly adversity and adaptive or maladaptive outcomes Obradovic, Stamperdahl, Adler, & Boyce, 2010). For example, Ob radovic et al. (2010) found high RSA withdrawal to be associated with more maladaptive o utcomes in the context of high adversity but with more adaptive outcomes in the context of l ow adversity in children. Still, others found no differences in RSA baseline or reactivity in association with ACEs (Shenk, Putnam, Rausch, Peugh, & Noll, 2014; van Ockenburg et al., 2014). 26 1.5.3. Difficulties in examining alterations of str ess response Some of the divergent findings in the relationship between ACEs and endocrine as well as autonomic stress response may be due to the fact th at studies differ regarding sample characteristics, age groups, type of adversity, and stressors assessed: many studies have used clinical samples with the problem of comorbid sympt omatology (e.g. Blechert et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 2000; Heim, Newport, et al., 2000). S tudies on RSA have often focused on children and adolescents and have examined RSA as a m e d i a t o r b e t w e e n A C E s a n d o t h e r outcome variables (e.g. Ellis et al., 2005; Obradov ic et al., 2010). Also, the simultaneous investigation of the different stress response syst ems, including endocrine, parasympathetic, and sympathetic indices is essential due to their c lose interaction and mutual innervation, but it is not always considered and previous results ar e mixed because of methodological differences (Andrews, D'Aguiar, & Pruessner, 2012; Bauer et al., 2002; Sapolsky, Romero, & Munck, 2000). Further, some of the inconsistencies in prior findings might be the result of inadequate adjustment for confounding factors such as hormonal contraceptives in HPA axis, respiratory rate in RSA, physical fitness, or depre ssive symptomatology (Grossman & Gaab , Schommer, Hellhammer, 1999). Finally, since most studies used brief self-report questionnaires or life events checklists to assess ACEs (e.g. Carpenter et al., 2011; Lovallo e t al., 2012), questions of their duration and the age of occurrence in association with stress re sponse in adulthood often remain unanswered, especially in healthy samples. 27 2. Research Questions The first objective of the present dissertation was t o e x t e n d p r e v i o u s f i n d i n g s o n t h e relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal , and sleep on a day-to-day basis. The second aim was to gain further knowledge regarding the understanding of the psychophysiological consequences of stress experien ces during childhood and adolescence. ! Altogether, the main objective was to contribute to the knowledge about the impact of stress on a non-clinical sample of healthy young women. 2.1. Research Question Article 1 Various psychological factors, such as stress, dail y hassles, and hyperarousal have been found to play an essential role in the development of sle ep disturbances (e.g. Riemann et al., 2010), but the search for the specific roles and interplay among these factors is still ongoing. Morin et al. (2003) showed that in both, persons sufferin g from insomnia as well as good sleepers, subjective stress during the day was a significant predictor of worse subjective sleep quality the following night and that higher levels of presl eep arousal mediated this relationship. However, objective sleep measures were not used in this study. Also, empirical studies in healthy young samples on the relationship between s tress and sleep on a day-to-day basis using within-participant data measured over time ar e still scarce. A daily life sleep-diary and actigraphy study was c onducted in order to replicate the mediating role of presleep arousal between stress a nd sleep considering both, subjective and actigraphic sleep measures, as well as between- and w i t h i n p a r t i c i p a n t d a t a . M u l t i l e v e l modelling was used to evaluate the relationship acr oss days. Furthermore, computerized diaries were used to enhance compliance and reliabi lity compared to paper-and-pencil data. 2.2. Research Question Article 2 As stated in the theoretical part of this work, ACE s have been shown to constitute an important risk factor for the development and persi stence of physical and mental disorders (Wegman & Stetler, 2009). Changes in the functionin g of stress response systems due to repeated or long-lasting ACEs or trauma have been s uggested to be the cause for higher vulnerability to stress-related disorders (e.g. Chr ousos, 2009; Heim & Nemeroff, 2001). While many studies stated exaggerated HPA axis and SNS responses in the context of ACEs and psychopathology (e.g. Heim, Newport, et al., 20 00; Rao et al., 2008), other studies observed blunted cortisol or heart rate responses i n non-clinical samples after laboratory stress induction (Carpenter et al., 2011; Lovallo et al., 2012). Due to evidence that exceeding or 28 prolonged stimulation of the stress system during c ritical developmental periods could lead to lasting alterations in stress reactivity, it is imp ortant to examine the role of the age of occurrence of ACEs as well as the duration of ACEs in the relationship between early adversity and stress reactivity (Tottenham & Sherid an, 2010). Therefore, the aim of the second article was to rep licate the findings of attenuated endocrine and cardiovascular stress reactivity in a ssociation with ACEs in a young and healthy female sample. Additionally, the associatio n between the age of occurrence as well as the duration of adverse events and cortisol as well as heart rate reactivity in adulthood was examined. The Early Trauma Inventory-Self Report (E TI-SR) served as a validated and detailed method in measuring ACEs (Bremner, Bolus, & Mayer, 2007), enabling the assessment of a wide range of stress and trauma exp osure before the age of 18, as well as age of occurrence and duration of events. 2.3. Research Question Article 3 In accordance with the study by Lovallo et al. (201 2), we found blunted cardiovascular stress response in association with higher number of ACEs in the second article. However, since heart rate is regulated by both, sympathetic and pa rasympathetic efferent activity of the ANS, it remains unclear whether attenuated heart rate re activity is caused by blunted sympathetic response or less parasympathetic withdrawal, or a c ombination of both (Berntson et al., 1991). Therefore, the third article aimed at clarifying th e role of the sympathetic (indexed by SBP) and the parasympathetic (indexed by RSA) cardi ovascular stress response in the observed blunted heart rate reactivity in associati on with ACEs as well as age of occurrence of ACEs. The objective was to extend previous findi ngs by investigating the relationship between ACEs, SBP, and RSA during baseline and in r eaction to a psychosocial stress task in healthy young women, including the consideration of p o t e n t i a l l y c o n f o u n d i n g v a r i a b l e s . I n exploratory analyses, the different ACE subscales a nd their association with SBP and RSA were analysed in order to be able to compare differ ent types of adversity in the same sample. 29 3. Methods Three original articles, all analysing different as pects of the interaction between ACEs, stress and sleep in young women, were conducted. In the fo llowing section the study designs and methods are briefly described. All data were collected in the context of a large s tudy investigating acute stress, emotion regulation, and sleep in healthy young wome n with a history of stress exposure. Therefore, the general procedure of the study is de scribed first, followed by specific methodic details of the three original articles. 3.1. General study procedure Participants were recruited using flyers posted at schools for healthcare professions and social work in Basel, Switzerland, or by e-mails sent by t he schools. Potential study participants contacted the study office by e-mail or phone. They w e r e s e n t a s c r e e n i n g q u e s t i o n n a i r e assessing the following inclusion criteria: female sex, age range between 18 and 25 years, German speaking, and good health. All participants were screened on inclusion and exclusion criteria in a first office appointment, provided wr itten informed consent, and filled in relevant questionnaires before they started a two-week ambul atory assessment of stress, presleep arousal, and sleep. Exclusion criteria for all part icipants included physical or psychiatric illness, pregnancy, regular heavy tobacco use (>5 c igarettes a day), use of illegal drugs, night shift work, and use of any medication, which interf eres either with sleep or with the nervous or the adrenocorticoid system. The absence of psych iatric illness was assessed with the German version of the Structured Clinical Interview f o r D S M - I V ( S K I D I f o r D S M - I V ; Wittchen, Wunderlich, Gruschwitz, & Zaudig, 1997). Further relevant data including age, physical health, and other exclusion criteria were assessed by interview. After one week of assessment, participants reported t o t h e l a b o r a t o r y f o r a s t r e s s examination, which took place between 3:30 pm and 6 :00 pm to control for circadian variation and lasted for approximately 2.5 hours. P articipants were told that the laboratory assessment would include a test on cognitive perfor mance. After initial accommodation, a baseline period and a paced breathing task followed . Participants then engaged in the stress task, which was followed by a recovery period. At t he end of the laboratory testing, participants were debriefed. After another week of ambulatory sleep assessment, participants returned their materials and received monetary comp ensation. The Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST; Dedovic et al., 2005) was used to induce a psychosocial stress response. The MIST is a standar dized psychosocial stress test during 30 which participants have to solve arithmetic tasks u nder time pressure and social evaluation. Participants have to complete three experimental ru ns while their success rate is artificially restrained to a maximum 45-50% and at the same time social evaluative threat is enhanced by negative feedback by the investigator. In contrast to other often used psychosocial stress t a s k s l i k e t h e T r i e r S o c i a l S t r e s s Test (TSST, Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993), the MIST does not require speaking during stress assessment and also, participants rem ain in a quiet sitting position. This has the advantage that fewer artifacts due to movement or s peaking are caused in psychobiological parameters like heart rate. It also ensures that re spiratory pattern change (steep, short inspiration and long expiration, (Wilhelm, Handke, & Roth, 2003) due to speaking cannot interfere with RSA assessment. 3.2. Methods Article 1 3.2.1. Study Design and Procedure A daily life computerized sleep diary and actigraph y study was conducted to investigate the mediating role of presleep arousal in the relations hip between daily stress and sleep. After receiving instructions during the first office appo intment, participants started the two-week ambulatory assessment. Sleep logs were completed ev ery morning immediately after rising while daily stress and presleep arousal were measur ed every evening immediately before bedtime. This repeated-measures design enabled to i nvestigate effects on both levels, between participants and within participants, with multilev el modelling. 3.2.2. Study Sample The sample included 145 young and healthy women (me an age 21.7 \u00b1 1.6 years). One participant had to be excluded because sleep parame ters could not be calculated reliably due to incomplete information about sleep and wake time s. 3.2.3. Data Assessment Participants wore an ambulatory wrist actigraph (Mi cro Mini-Motionlogger, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY) for 14 successive day s and nights on the non-dominant arm. Additionally, daily sleep logs were completed by th e participants to cross-validate sleep start and end times. The dependent variable sleep efficie ncy (SE) was calculated as the ratio of total time asleep to time in bed. For the assessment of daily self-report measures, a m e n u - d r i v e n c o m p u t e r i z e d questionnaire was developed to repeatedly measure s ubjective estimates of sleep quality, daily 31 stress, and presleep arousal. Concerning subjective sleep quality, participants were instructed to fill in a computerized Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (very good sleep quality) to 5 (very poor sleep quality). For statistical analyses, the scale was reversed to have higher values for higher sleep quality. Presleep arousal was assessed with the Presleep Arousal Scale al., 1985, German version; Gieselmann, de Jong-Meyer, & Pietrowsky, 2012), which contains 16 items with eight symptoms of cogn itive and eight symptoms of somatic arousal experienced at bed-time. Ratings range from 1 (not at al l) to 5 ( extremely ). A total score was computed for both subscales with higher s cores indicating higher arousal. The occurrence of daily stressors was measured by the D aily Stress Inventory (DSI; Brantley et al., 1987, German version; Hrabal, & Kosarz, 2 0 0 0 ) , w h i c h i s a 5 8 - i t e m s e l f - r e p o r t questionnaire assessing the occurrence and the impa ct of 58 possible daily stressors. Three scores can be derived: the actual number of events that occurred during the day (frequency); the sum of impact ratings (total impact of all even ts); and the average impact rating (sum of all ratings divided by the frequency). 3.2.4. Statistical Analyses Because of the hierarchical structure of the data ( days and nights nested within participants) and with the aim to be able to predict fluctuations f r o m n i g h t t o n i g h t i n t h e v a r i a b l e s , a multilevel modelling approach was used. Multilevel models are an extension of the general linear model and do not require observations to be independent. Because of their autoregressive nature and hierarchical structure, m ulti-level models are especially useful to study time-dependent changes (Bauer, Preacher, & Gi l, 2006; Preacher, Zyphur, & Zhang, 2010). By applying this approach, we were able to e xamine the relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep within and betw een participants. Analyses on the between-participants level addresse d the question if participants who experienced higher levels of daily stress also repo rted higher levels of arousal and worse sleep compared to participants reporting lower levels of daily stress and arousal. Analyses on the within-participant level addressed the question if individuals reported higher arousal and worse sleep on days when they also reported above a verage stress levels compared to their individual average level. 32 3.3. Methods Article 2 3.3.1. Study Design and Procedure A quasi-experimental approach was used to investiga te the relationship between ACEs and endocrine as well as cardiovascular reactivity afte r psychosocial stress induction. Participants completed the Early Trauma Inventory self-report (E TI-SR; Bremner et al., 2007) and engaged in the MIST while salivary cortisol and hea rt rate responses were assessed. For women taking no oral contraceptives, the laboratory assessment was held in the luteal phase of the participant's menstrual cycle (Kirschbaum et al., 1999). 3.3.2. Study Sample The sample included 104 young and healthy women (me an age 21.7 \u00b1 1.5 years). Participants with acute illness during laboratory testing, failu re in recording devices or unlikely high and fluctuating cortisol values had to be excluded. 3.3.3. Data Assessment ACEs before the age of 18 were assessed using a Ger man translation of The Early Trauma inventory self-report (ETI-SR; Bremner et al., 2007). The questionnaire includes g eneral trauma (31 items), as well as physical (9 items), e motional (7 items), and sexual abuse (15 items). Participants were asked a series of yes or no questions regarding potential trauma and stress exposure. For positively answered items, age o f o c c u r r e n c e , f r e q u e n c y / d u r a t i o n , a n d emotional impact were assessed, and different ACE s cores were built: Events with an emotional impact of at least 1 (\"slightly negative\" ) were summed up to ACE total sum score. Furthermore, a sum score for ACEs lasting less than a year ( ACEs < one year ) and for ACEs lasting more than a year ( ACEs > one year ) was computed. Age of occurrence was assessed in two ways: In a first step, events which occurred before or after a participants' menarche were summed up to ACEs before and after menarche, respectively. Additionally, age of first ACE occurrence was determined for each subject by taking the earli est age of onset across all domains. Free salivary cortisol was measured using salivette s at seven measurement points, twice before the stress task (-10 and -1 minutes) a nd five times after the stress task (+1, +10, +25, +40 and +55 minutes). Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were taken using electrode placement on the thorax, and heart rate was average d for Baseline, Stress 1, Stress 2, Stress 3 and Recovery periods in reference to manually set t ime markers in accordance with the 33 various sections of the experiment. Subjective emot ional response to the MIST was assessed using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for mood, tensio n, and stress. 3.3.4. Statistical Analyses In a first step, repeated measures General linear m odel (GLM) was used to assess if the stress task led to a significant physiological and subject ive emotional stress response. Further, GLMs for repeated measures served to determine the effects of ACEs on endocrine and cardiovascular responses. The different ACE scores were used as continuous variables to examine effects of time, ACE scores, and the intera ction of time by ACE scores. Covariates included in all statistical models were BMI, the us e of oral contraceptives, and, in post-hoc analyses, the emotional responses to the MIST (mood , tension, and stress). 3.4. Methods Article 3 3.4.1. Study Design and Procedure A quasi-experimental approach was used to investiga te the relationship between ACEs and sympathetic as well as parasympathetic cardiovascul ar stress reactivity after psychosocial stress induction. Participants completed the ETI-SR (B remner et al., 2007), and eng aged in the MIST while SBP and RSA were assessed. Respirato ry rate was assessed in order to be able to include it as a covariate in statistical an alyses to account for its potential confounding influence on RSA in within-subject change analyses (Grossman & Taylor, 2007). After baseline, a paced breathing task was conducted in o rder to standardize respiratory rate between individuals during assessment of individual d i f f e r e n c e s i n r e s t i n g R S A ( W i l h e l m , Grossman, & Coyle, 2004). 3.4.2. Study Sample The sample included 129 young and healthy women (me an age 21.7 \u00b1 1.7 years). Participants with acute illness during the laboratory session or m i s s i n g d a t a d u e t o t e c h n i c a l f a i l u r e o f recording devices had to be excluded. 3.4.3. Data Assessment ACEs before the age of 18 were assessed using a Ger man translation of the ETI-SR (see article two; Bremner et al., 2007). Events were sum med up to a total score of occurred events (ACE total score ). For exploratory purposes, separate scores were c omputed for the four subscales (general trauma, physical, emotional, and sexual abuse). Additionally, the variable 34 age of first ACE occurrence w a s d e t e r m i n e d f o r e a c h s u b j e c t b y t a k i n g t h e e a r l iest age of onset across all domains. SBP was assessed using an ambulatory blood pressure m o n i t o r ( A p o n o r m \u00ae B a s i s Control, Germany) during the last minute of baselin e and about 30 seconds after the start of each of the stress runs. A baseline-to-stress react ivity score was computed by subtracting SBP at baseline from SBP during the stress task (mean o f all three stress runs). For the assessment of RSA, electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were acq uired using electrode placement on the thorax in a standard Lead II configuration with thr ee disposable electrodes. Respiration pattern was recorded using an inductive plethysmogr aph (Respiband, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY) applied around the upper rip cag e. Both RSA and mean respiratory rate were determined for baseline, paced breathing, and the three experimental stress runs. These intervals were defined by markers, which were manua lly set and recorded in the course of the experiment. RSA withdrawal was computed by subtract ing baseline RSA from RSA during the stress task (mean of all three stress runs). Th erefore, higher values stand for less RSA withdrawal (less decrease of RSA). 3.4.4. Statistical Analyses To examine whether the stress task induced signific ant increase in SBP and decrease in RSA, a paired samples t-test was conducted. Pearson correlations were used in order to examine the relationship between ACE total score as well as age of first ACE occurrence and indices of sympathetic and parasympathetic functioning (i.e., SBP at baseline, SBP reactivity, RSA at baseline, and RSA reactivity). Partial correlations were performed for RSA reactiv ity controlling for the potentially confounding influence of changes in respiratory rat e from baseline to stress condition (Grossman & Kollai, 1993). For assessment with stan dardized respiratory rate, a Pearson correlation between RSA during paced breathing and ACE total score was calculated. Exploratory analyses were used to examine the assoc iation between the four ACE subscales and SBP as well as RSA using a more conse rvative p < 0.01 significance criterion to reduce type-I error. Since distributional assump tions were not met ACE subscales, non-parametric Spearman correlations were conducted . 35 4. Summary of Results The following section gives a brief overview of the results of the three articles. For further descriptions and information, the articles are cont ained in the appendix. 4.1. Daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep in h ealthy young women: a daily life computerized sleep diary and actigraphy study The average subjective sleep quality of 3.81 \u00b1 1.0 (SD) (range from 0 (lowest sleep quality) to 5 (highest sleep quality)) and a mean SE of 93.7% \u00b1 5.1% ( SD) indicated good sleep during the study period in our sample of healthy young wom en. Participants reported an average of 10.52 \u00b1 6.68 ( SD) (out of 50 possible) daily stress events per day. Mean cognitive presleep arousal was 10.69 \u00b1 3.0 7 (SD), which indicated overall levels at the lower end of the continuum (range 8-35 for both scales). On the between-participant level a strong positive relationship was found between stress and arousal in general (i.e., significant as sociations ( p < . 0 0 1 ) f o r a l l t h r e e t y p e s o f stress scores with somatic as well as cognitive aro usal). A significant association between presleep arousal and sleep was only found for the r elationship between somatic arousal and subjective sleep quality but not for any other medi ator-outcome pair. As a consequence, there was only one significant mediating effect of somati c arousal for the relationship between stress (as expressed by all three types of measures ) and subjective sleep quality ( p < .01 for all three stress measures). Thus, participants who repo rted higher average stress compared to others also reported higher somatic arousal and wor se subjective sleep quality. All other indirect effects tested did not yield significance: i n c o n t r a s t t o s u b j e c t i v e s l e e p q u a l i t y , somatic arousal did not play a mediating role betwe en stress and actigraphic SE, and cognitive arousal did not play a mediating role between stres s and both SE and subjective sleep quality. As seen for the between-participant level, there wa s a strong positive relationship between stress and arousal on the within-participan t level ( p < .001 for all associations). Thus, both cognitive, and somatic presleep arousal were i ncreased on days with reported increased stress. There was a significant mediating effect of s o m a t i c a r o u s a l f o r t h e r e l a t i o n s h i p between stress (sum and average impact of stress) a nd actigraphy-recorded SE (in the unexpected direction of higher SE, p < .05 for both stress measures). Thus, subsequent SE was increased on days with reported increased stres s (compared to participant's own mean), which was significantly mediated by somatic arousal . Additionally, there was a significant mediating effect of cognitive arousal on the relati onship between stress (as expressed by all three types of measures) and subjective sleep quali ty (p < .05 for all three stress measures). 36 Thus, on days with reported increased stress (compa red to days with a lower level of stress), participant's subsequent subjective sleep quality w as decreased, which was significantly mediated by cognitive arousal. 4.2. Blunted endocrine and cardiovascular reactivit y in young healthy women reporting a history of childhood adversity Results obtained by repeated GLM measure analyses i ndicated that the stress task induced a significant increase in cortisol levels [ F(1.87, 185.52) = 27.16, p < rate [ F(1.85, 164.95) = 216.86, p < . 0 0 1 ; !p2 = .71]. Subjects experienced significant worsening of mood [ F(3.53, 360.36) = 31.72, p < . 0 0 1 ; !p2 = .24], as well as increases in tension [ F(3.78, 385.39) = 32.82, p < .001; !p2 stress [ F(3.90, 389.15) = 28.45, p < . 0 0 1 ; !p2 = .22]. There was no significant association betwee n the subjective emotional responses to the MIST and the total numbe r of ACEs, or cortisol and heart rate responses (all p >.1). Concerning cortisol responses to stress, repeated m easures analysis showed a significant interaction of time x ACE total sum score [F(2.33, 221.60) = 5.89, p < . 0 0 1 ; !p2 = .06] as well as a significant main effect of ACE total sum score [F(1, 95) = 7.52, p < .01; !p2 = . 0 7 ] , i n d i c a t i n g t h a t m o r e A C E s w e r e a s s o c i a t e d with attenuated cortisol responses. Further, results showed a significant main effect o f duration of ACEs > one year [F(1, 95) = 10.10, p < .01; !p2 = .10] and a significant interaction of time and d uration of ACEs > one year [F(2.33, 221.16) = 5.36, p < .01; !p2 = .05]. However, these effects were not observed f or the association between ACEs that lasted shorter in duration ( ACEs < one year ) and cortisol responses to the stress task [main effect, F(1, 95) = .64, p = .43; interaction effect, F(2.24, 213.21) = 1.05, p = . 3 6 ]. C o n c e r n i n g t h e ag e o f o c c u r re n c e , a s i g n i f icant interaction effect [F(2.33, 220.99) = 6.48, p < .01; !p2 = .06], and a significant main effect were observed for the sum of events which occurred before menarche [F(1, 95) = 10.26, p < .01; !p2 = .09]. For events which occurred after menarche , these effects were not observed [main effect, F(1, 95) = .18, p = .67; interaction effect, F(2.24, 212.34) = .63, p = .55]. For the specific age of first ACE occurrence , no significant associations were observed [main e ffect, F(1, 78) = .71, p = .40; interaction effect, F(2.24, 174.75) = .56, p = .58]. Concerning heart rate response to the stress task, repeated measure analysis showed a significant main effect of ACE total sum score [F(1, 85) = 7.13, p < .01; !p2 = .08] as well as a significant interaction effect of time x ACE total sum score [F(1.98, 168.32) = 5.86, p < .01; !p2 = .07], indicating that more ACEs were associated w ith attenuated heart rate responses. Further analyses with duration as well as age of oc currence of ACEs revealed no significant 37 association with heart rate responses to the stress task. All results remained significant when the emotional responses to the stress task were ent ered additionally as covariates. 4.3. Adverse childhood experiences are associated w ith blunted sympathetic stress responsivity in healthy young women Results from paired samples t-tests indicated that the stress task had high pote ncy and induced significant increase in SBP ( t(128) = -23.87, p = .000, d = 1.59) as well as decrease in RSA (t(128) = 9.63, p = .000, d = 0.82). A significant negative correlation was found for ACE total score and SBP reactivity (r = -0.295, p = 0.001). For ACE total score and SBP at baseline, there was an association being short of significance ( r = -0.159, p = 0.072). Specifically, higher ACE total score was associated with lower SBP reactivity as well as a t rend for lower SBP at baseline. No significant correlation was found for ACE total score a n d R S A a t b a s e l i n e ( r = -0.036, p = 0.688) or RSA during paced breathing condition ( r = 0.161, p = 0.102). There was a significant association between ACE total score and RSA reactivity ( r = 0.188, p = 0.033). Specifically, higher ACE total score w a s a s s o c i a t e d w i t h l o w e r R S A r e a c t i v i t y . H o w e v e r , when respiratory rate reactivity was controlled for , the association between ACE total score and RSA reactivity was no longer significant ( r = 0.123, p = 0.188). Concerning age of first ACE occurrence , Pearson correlations showed a significant association with SBP reactivity ( r = 0.241, p = 0.010). Earlier ACE occurrence was associated with lower SBP reactivity. Age of first ACE occurrence correlated moderately with ACE total score (r = -0.298, p = 0.001). When total score was entered as a covari ate, the association between age of first ACE occurrence and SBP reactivity was short of significance ( r = 0.183, p = 0.052). Also, there was an association between e arlier age of ACE occurrence and lower RSA reactivity being short of significance ( r = -0.161, p = 0.088). Again, this association was no longer significant after controlling for respira tory rate ( r = - 0 . 1 3 1 , p = 0.190). No significant associations were observed for the rela tionship between age of first ACE occurrence and SBP at baseline or RSA at baseline. Spearman correlations showed a significant associat ion between general trauma and SBP reactivity ( ! = -0.282, p = 0.001). A higher ACE score in general trauma was associated with lower SBP reactivity. Using the more conservat ive criterion of p < 0 . 0 1 , n o f u r t h e r significant associations between ACE subscales and SBP baseline, RSA baseline, and RSA reactivity were observed. 38 5. Discussion The aim of the present dissertation was to contribu te to the knowledge about different aspects of stress and their impact on healthy young women. The first objective was to extend previous findings on the relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep since empirical studies on a day-to-day basis using between- and wi thin-participant data are still scarce. !Both subjective and actigraphic sleep measures were asse ssed in a daily life study in healthy young women. The second aim was to gain further knowledge reg arding the understanding of the psychophysiological consequences of stress experien ces during childhood and adolescence. ! Therefore, the association between ACEs and endocri ne as well as cardiovascular stress reactivity in response to a psychosocial stress tas k was investigated with the subsequent third aim to clarify the role of the sympathetic and the parasympathetic branches of the ANS in cardiovascular stress responsivity. 5.1. Daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep in h ealthy young women: a daily life computerized sleep diary and actigraphy study The first article examined the relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep in healthy young women using multilevel structural equ ation models. In summary, our results confirm that presleep arousal plays an important ro le in mediating the effects of daily stress on sleep quality and SE in healthy young women. On the between-participant level, our results showed a mediating role of somatic presleep arousal between higher daily stress and worse subjective sleep quality, while there was no mediating role of presleep arousal between daily stress and actigraphy-assessed SE. On the wit hin-participant level, results showed a mediating role of cognitive presleep arousal betwee n increased daily stress and worse subjective sleep quality. Further, results showed a mediating role of somatic presleep arousal between daily stress and actigraphic SE in an unexp ected direction. On days with higher levels of daily stress relative to their own mean, participants experienced higher somatic presleep arousal and showed subsequent higher SE du ring the following night as indexed by reduced wake time during sleep. The mediating role of cognitive arousal on the with in-participant level as well as the mediating role of somatic arousal on the between-pa rticipant level are in accordance with our hypothesis. However, there is evidence for a more g eneral influence of arousal, with somatic and cognitive arousal being relevant on both levels , between and within-participants (Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2010; Morin et al., 2003 ; Wuyts et al., 2012), which we could not corroborate. A possible explanation for this discre pancy may be the fact that our study 39 volunteer sample differed from samples in other stu dies regarding age and gender distribution. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that o ur sample consisted of young and overall good sleepers with no clinical sleep impairment, as c o n f i r m e d b y t h e o v e r a l l h i g h S E a n d subjective sleep quality. In addition, the women of our sample showed generally low levels of stress and arousal, which might further explain why we did not find arousal to significantly influence sleep in several of our analyses. In acco rdance with our results, Morin et al. (2003) mentioned that associations between arousal and sub jective sleep quality were low in their sample. We consistently found higher levels of stress to be a s s o c i a t e d w i t h h i g h e r l e v e l s o f cognitive and somatic presleep arousal, which is in a c c o r d a n c e w i t h c u r r e n t m o d e l s o f insomnia, all including some sort of interplay betw een stress and arousal in the development of insomnia (Espie, 2002; Morin, 1993; Riemann et a l., 2010). While the results on the level of subjective sleep quality did partially fit the a ssumption of higher stress and arousal being associated with worse subjective sleep quality, thi s relationship did not seem to apply for actigraphy-assessed sleep data, which does not fit into insomnia models at first sight. Still, this finding is not necessarily contradictory since i t i s w e l l - k n o w n t h a t t h e s u b j e c t i v e perception of impaired sleep is not always objectiv ely measurable in actigraphic or polysomnographic sleep data (Jackowska, Dockray, He ndrickx, & Steptoe, 2011; Means et al., 2003). Also, all models require some sort of d ysregulation or malfunctioning of the homeostatic or regulatory processes in the developm ent of insomnia (e.g., de-arousal processes, sleep habits, chronobiologic Riemann et al., 2010). Therefore , it fits into the models that these homeostatic processes are still intact and sleep is n o t a u t o m a t i c a l l y i m p a i r e d a f t e r experiencing higher levels of stress and arousal in a s a m p l e o f h e a l t h y w o m e n w i t h o u t clinically significant sleep impairment. It might b e possible that higher levels of stress and arousal might not yet influence actigraphic sleep m easures in a young and healthy sample but could still constitute a factor preceding the devel opment of subsequent sleep disturbances (e.g. Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2010; Jansson-Fr\u00f6jm ark & Linton, 2008). Finally, subjective sleep quality and actigraphy-recorded SE measure di fferent aspects of sleep, which are not exactly comparable. Actigraphy-assessed measures de tect sleep-wake cycles by an accelerometer and objectively quantify sleep durati on and number of awakenings in relation to the time spent in bed. Subjective sleep quality estimates include a variety of perceived sleep features, such as consciously perceived sleep disruptions, well-being, and sleep inertia on awakening, all entering the total, subjective pe rception of sleep quality. Interestingly, 40 participants even showed higher SE on days with abo ve average levels of stress and somatic arousal, which may indicate an adaptive response to stress. In conclusion, the first study provides important k nowledge regarding the relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep. It confirms that arousal plays a mediating role between stress and subjective sleep quality, e ven in a sample of healthy young women. This mediating role was restricted to somatic arous al being relevant on the interindividual level and cognitive arousal on the intraindividual level. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to investigate between- and with in-participant levels, along with subjective and actigraphy-assessed sleep outcomes in young adu lts. Actigraphic SE was not impaired by stress and arousal in healthy young women, who migh t even be able to compensate for days with above average levels of stress and arousal dur ing the subsequent night. 5.2. Blunted endocrine and cardiovascular reactivit y in young healthy women reporting a history of childhood adversity The results of the second article confirmed previou s reports of attenuated endocrine (Carpenter et al., 2007; Carpenter et al., 2011; El zinga et al., 2008; Lovallo et al., 2012) as well as cardiovascular (Lovallo et al., 2012) stres s responses to a psychosocial stress test in healthy adults with a history of ACEs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to demonstrate that in healthy female subjects, especi ally long enduring, chronic ACEs seem to be associated with blunted cortisol reactivity. Whi le the sum of events which occurred before menarche was significantly associated with blunted cortisol reactivity, the sum of events after menarche was not. Also, in this sample, the specifi c age of occurrence did not contribute to a further understanding of the association between ti ming of ACEs and endocrine reactivity. Besides the finding of diminished heart rate respon ses in association with the total number of ACEs, duration as well as age of occurrence of ACEs were not associated with cardiovascular reactivity. Importantly, blunted cortisol and heart r a t e r e s p o n s e s w e r e i n d e p e n d e n t o f emotional responses, suggesting that the diminished e n d o c r i n e a n d c a r d i o v a s c u l a r s t r e s s reactivity cannot be explained by a reduced emotion al reaction to stress after a history of childhood adversity. Our results in participants free of mental and phys ical illness show a deviation from heightened endocrine and cardiovascular stress resp onse often reported in other samples in association with a history of ACEs (e.g. Heim, Newp ort, et al., 2000; Rao et al., 2008). However, according to recent findings on stress rea ctivity (Ellis et al., 2005; Obradovic, 2012) in the context of early adversity, and considering the diversity of mediating factors mentioned in the background, it is more accurate to state tha t exposure to early life stress may lead to 41 dysregulated physiological phenotypes rather than t o a particular pattern of hyper- or hyposensitivity. Also, the recently proposed adapti ve calibration model (Del Giudice et al., 2011) offers an evolutionary-developmental theory o f individual differences in physiological reactivity processes. The authors hypothesize that, at a very general level, a nonlinear relation between adverse life event exposure and stress resp onse exists. In the context of high adversity, the model predicts an either vigilant pr ofile, characterized by high biological stress responsiveness, or an unemotional, under-responsive profile, characterized by generally low SNS and HPA axis activity. These different phenotyp es might be mediated by the interaction of various factors such as the study sample, the ty pe of maltreatment, complex environmental, and genetic factors. In terms of environmental factors, studies have dem onstrated that the HPA axis in early human development is under strong social regu lation (Tarullo & Gunnar, 2006). Therefore, sensitive environments (such as sensitiv e parenting or caregiving) have been suggested to moderate HPA reactivity by buffering c ortisol responses being deprived of an evolutionarily expectable level of care (e.g. institutional rearing) has been a s s o c i a t e d w i t h d y s r e g u l a t e d c o r t i s o l response (Carlson & Earls, 1997; Gunnar, Morison, C hisholm, & Schuder, 2001). However, studies with institutionalized children were also a ble to show that improved caregiving environments had an effect on normalizing diurnal r hythms of the HPA axis (see for review: Slopen, McLaughlin, & Shonkoff, 2014). The social b uffering of the HPA axis is supported by findings in animal models. In their extensive su mmary of literature, Hostinar et al. (Hostinar, Sullivan, & Gunnar, 2014) report results from animal studies, which suggest that neural mechanisms are responsible for behavioural a nd neuroendocrine changes due to social buffering. These findings in human and animal studies provide support for an adaptive response of the stress system to its environment, probably i n order to enhance survival odds. This might support the hypothesis, that in a chronically stres sful environment, after an initial hypersecretion of cortisol, the HPA axis could coun ter-regulate its response and cortisol output might rebound to below normal. A plausible b iological explanation could be an increased glucocorticoid negative feedback with a d own-regulation of CRF receptors, or a diminished release of cortisol by the adrenal gland s (Fries et al., 2005; Heim, Ehlert, et al., 2000). The finding that especially chronic events w ere associated with a blunted cortisol response supports this view. 42 In terms of genetic and epigenetic factors, prelimi nary evidence links genetic and epigenetic alterations to stress reactivity in asso ciation with ACEs. For example, a history of ACEs has been linked to an epigenetic regulation of h i p p o c a m p a l g l u c o c o r t i c o i d r e c e p t o r expression (McGowan et al., 2009). Moreover, a rece nt study on healthy adults who experienced the loss of a parent during childhood, maltreatment, or low parental care showed epigenetic alterations (increased methylation) of a r e g i o n o f t h e h u m a n g l u c o c o r t i c o i d receptor gene, which in turn was associated with bl unted cortisol reactivity after a neuroendocrine challenge test in these participants (Tyrka et al., 2012). Another study linked prenatal maternal depression to increased methylati on of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in newborns, and showed exaggerated salivary cortisol output to stress at three months of age (Oberlander et al., 2008). In summary, our results raise the challenging quest ion of whether the observed alterations in stress responsivity can be interpret ed as a potential risk factor or as a sign of resilience to the development of later mental and p hysical disorders. Even if initially adaptive, blunted cortisol reactivity could compromise future a n d n e c e s s a r y p s y c h o b i o l o g i c a l s t r e s s reactivity. As already mentioned, low cardiovascula r and/or endocrine reactivity to acute psychological stress has been associated with fibro myalgia, adiposity, burn out, atypical depression, and Gold & Chrousos, 2002; Heim, Ehlert, et al., 2000; Jones et Hunt, Der, & Ca rroll, 2011; Pruessner, Hellhammer, & Kirschbaum, 1999). 5.3. Adverse childhood experiences are associated w ith blunted sympathetic stress responsivity in healthy young women The third article extends the previous finding of b lunted heart rate reactivity in response to the stress task by clarifying the role of the sympathet ic and parasympathetic branches of the ANS. Our results show blunted SBP reactivity in associat ion with higher number of ACEs, indicating down-regulation of phasic sympathetic st ress response. No significant association was found between ACEs and RSA reactivity after con trolling for respiratory rate changes, which indicates that blunted heart rate response wa s not appreciably influenced by alterations in parasympathetic functioning. In addition to blun ted SBP reactivity, participants with higher number of ACEs showed a trend for lower SBP at base line. Additionally, we found blunted SBP reactivity in as sociation with earlier age of occurrence of ACEs. This implies that the finding o f blunted SBP reactivity in the context of ACEs applies particularly to participants with earl y ACE occurrence, which is in accordance with the hypothesis that earlier developmental peri ods could be especially sensitive for lasting 43 alterations in stress response (Charmandari et al., 2003; Tottenham & Sheridan, 2010). Still, the association was only short of significance afte r controlling for ACE total score. The total number of ACEs and the age of first occurrence of A CEs are not independent from each other since it is known that early ACEs or traumatisation enhance the probability of future adversity (Desai, Arias, Thompson, & Basile, 2002). The finding of blunted SBP at baseline as well as b lunted SBP reactivity is contrary to several findings of heightened sympathetic activity and reactivity in clinical and non-clinical samples with adversity (Blechert 2007; et al., 2000; Otte et al., 2005; Su et al., 2014). Still, the result of blunted reac tivity is in accordance with the findings of Lovallo et al. (2012) and Leitzke et al. (2013), wh o reported blunted heart rate or SBP reactivity in their samples. Lovallo et al. (2012) explain their finding with altered functioning of stress systems towards a blunted response and ar gue that deviations from the norm in either direction (exaggerated or diminished stress reactiv ity) might signal a system's loss of efficient allostatic regulation. This is in accordance with t heories of allostatic load (McEwen, 1998) as well as with evidence of adverse health outcomes in association with blunted stress response (see for review: Carroll, Lovallo, & C., 2009; Gold & C h r o u s o s , 2 0 0 2 ; L o v a l l o , 2 0 1 1 ) . Leitzke et al. (2013) consider the possibility of u seful adaptation as an explanation for their finding of blunted SBP reactivity in youth. They ar gue that an attenuated stress response might be adaptive in the context of repeated signif icant but not overwhelming stress exposure because it reduces chronic activation, fearfulness, a n d p s y c h o p h y s i o l o g i c a l a c t i v i t y t o subsequent stressors (Gunnar, Frenn, Wewerka, & Van R y z i n , 2 0 0 9 ; L e i t z k e e t a l . , 2 0 1 3 ) . One may add that brief intermittent stress exposure r a t h er t h a n ze r o - s t r es s e n v i r o n m e n t s i n early life induces subsequent stress resistance, wh ich is referred to as stress inoculation (Parker, Buckmaster, Sundlass, Schatzberg, & Lyons, 2 0 0 6 ) . I n o u r h e a l t h y s a m p l e , A C E scores were on the lower end of the continuum, whic h indicates that the dosage of stressful experiences in the high-ACE individuals was still l ow enough to promote the development of stress resistance. It is likely that much higher AC E scores would have the opposite effect. This is in accordance with the adaptive calibration mode l (Del Giudice et al., 2011), which predicts a nonlinear relation between exposure to adversity and stress response, with moderate stress environments leading to a buffered responsivity pat tern while dangerous or unpredictable environments would lead to a vigilant responsivity pattern. A l t h o u g h h i g h e r A C E s c o r e s s i g n i f i c a n t l y c o r r e l a t e d with blunted RSA reactivity (i.e., vagal withdrawal), which is in accordance with impa ired parasympathetic withdrawal or slower recovery in response to trauma recall in sam ples with adversity or PTSD (Arditi-44 Babchuk et al., 2009; Cohen et al., 1998), the corr elation was no longer significant after controlling changes in respiratory rate. This indic ates that in our sample of healthy young women changes in parasympathetic functioning to str ess did not depend on the number of ACEs, and that the blunted heart rate reactivity we found in the second article was primarily due to reduced sympathetic reactivity. Also, no sig nificant association was found between ACEs and RSA at baseline (during spontaneous as wel l as paced breathing), indicating that the healthy young women did not differ in tonic vag al activity irrespective of the number of ACEs they have experienced. Although there is evide nce showing lower baseline RSA in association with adversity (Blechert et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 1997; Dale et al., 2009), many of these studies involved clinical samples or were conducted with children or adolescents, while our finding is in accordance with results fro m a representative sample of the Dutch population showing no differences in RSA measures a t rest in the context of ACEs (van Ockenburg et al., 2014). I n e x p l o r a t o r y a n a l y s e s w e f o u n d e v i d e n c e f o r a n a ssociation between blunted SBP reactivity and more incidences of general trauma, s uch as natural disasters, death of a close person, or separation of parents. Findings regardin g the association of different types of adversity and ANS functioning are still scarce but Lovallo et al. (2012) reported emotional adversity to be related to smaller heart rate respo nses. More studies have been conducted concerning endocrine stress response (Carpenter et al., 2011; Heim et al., 2008) but results are mixed with significant effects for different types of adversity in different samples. In conclusion, to our knowledge, there is not yet cons istent evidence for a specific pattern of certain types of ACEs being associated with specifi c alterations of the stress response. 5.4. Strengths and Limitations The present dissertation contains the first study t o investigate the relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep on both, betwee n- and within-participant levels, along with subjective and actigraphy-assessed sleep outcomes i n healthy young adults. It confirms that arousal plays a mediating role between stress and s ubjective sleep quality and contributes to the knowledge about the roles of somatic and cognit ive arousal, as well as actigraphic SE. The second article provides important knowledge abo ut the psychobiological consequences of stress and specifically, the relati onship between ACEs and endocrine as well as cardiovascular stress response. It strengthens t he assumption that ACEs give rise to a blunted stress reactivity of the HPA axis and the A NS in healthy young adults. The finding that ACEs represent a risk factor in the developmen t of alterations of the human stress system in the absence of current physical and mental illne ss contributes to a further understanding of 45 the consequences of stress experiences in childhood and adolescence. A further strength is the investigation of duration and age of occurrence of ACEs in the context of a laboratory stress task with the result that especially long enduring, c h r o n i c s t r e s s e x p e r i e n c e s , a s w e l l a s experiences which occurred before menarche, were as sociated with blunted cortisol response. The third article extends the finding of the second article by clarifying the role of the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the ANS i n b l u n t e d h e a r t r a t e r e a c t i v i t y i n response to the MIST. To our knowledge, it is the f irst study so far that has examined the association between ACEs and both branches of the A NS at the same time in otherwise healthy young adults. It confirms blunted SBP react ivity but not blunted RSA reactivity in association with more ACEs in healthy young women, indicating down-regulation of phasic sympathetic stress response but no alteration of pa rasympathetic functioning with ACEs. General strengths are the relatively large sample s ize and the control for potentially confounding variables in all three articles. Also, the confinement of the sample to physically and mentally healthy young women allowed to investi gate the association between ACEs and stress response as well as daily stress and sleep i n a homogenous non-clinical sample, free of psychiatric comorbidities and medications interferi ng with stress system assessment. Also, our sample represents an age group of healthy femal es, which has rarely been object to the investigation of ACEs and stress reactivity thus fa r. Beside these strengths, the results of the studies have to be evaluated in the context of their limitations. The following limitations have t o be considered for all three articles. First, due to the characteristics of the study samp le, the presented findings can only be generalized to young women free of mental and physi cal illness. To generalize these results to the whole population of healthy adults, it will be necessary to replicate the studies with participants of a broader age range and including b oth men and women. Also, the exclusion of participants with psychiatric diagnosis or physical pathology may have restricted the range of ACEs, stress reactivity, arousal, and sleep-related variables. Secondly, our sample consisted of young women atten ding schools for healthcare professions and social work. It cannot be excluded that there is a sample bias in the direction that only individuals who are particularly stress-r esilient and feeling capable of the demanding and straining work in healthcare chose th is kind of occupational career. Compliance was extraordinarily high in our sample, which supports the assumption that the sample was resilient to additional stress and dedic ated to social commitment. Finally, the assessment of ACEs, daily stress, pres leep arousal, and subjective sleep quality was based on subjective and self-report mea sures. Therefore, effects of memory as 46 well as selective recall due to retrospective bias cannot be excluded. Still, retrospective recall of sexual and physical abuse as well as physical an d emotional neglect have been evaluated to be sufficiently valid (Hardt & Rutter, 2004). Also, participants assessed stress, arousal, and sleep quality on the same day to keep retrospective b i a s a t a m i n i m u m . C o m p l i a n c e w i t h adequate time of entry was improved by the use of c omputerized diaries because participants were aware that times of diary entries are recorded (Stone, Shiffman, Schwartz, Broderick, & Hufford, 2003). A specific limitation of the first article is the a cquisition of sleep data being based on actigraphy and subjective sleep measures. Despite t he value of those data, studies using PSG would be useful to confirm our findings due to the high validity of PSG and its ability to consider additional dimensions of sleep. For the se cond study on endocrine stress response, only peripheral readouts of stress hormone activati on were measured, which implies that identifying the exact mechanisms or location of the o b s e r v e d dy s r eg u la t i o n i n t h e c o m p l e x and multilayer system of the HPA axis was not possi ble. Also, for methodological reasons, the specification between ACEs shorter/longer than one year and pre-/post-menarche cannot be assumed to be completely independent from each o ther. Since some participants reported both, acute and chronic ACEs as well as pre- and po st-menarche ACEs, it was not possible to have distinct orthogonal groups. In the third study , additional cardiovascular sympathetic indices, such as the pre-ejection period (PEP), wou ld have been advantageous (Schachinger, Weinbacher, Kiss, Ritz, & Langewitz, 2001). The ass essment of data on pre- and postnatal stress exposure was beyond the scope of the present i n v e s t i g a t i o n , b u t w o u l d h a v e b e e n valuable, since both, prenatal maternal stress and postnatal adversity, have been associated with alterations in stress response et al., 2012; Entringer, Kumsta, Hellhammer, Wadhwa, & Wust, 2009). 5.5. Clinical Implications and Future Research As a main conclusion of the first article, daily st ress is associated with higher somatic and cognitive presleep arousal and via this mediating p ath does influence subjective sleep quality in healthy young women. This implies that stress, e ven on a level of frequency and intensity which belongs to our daily life, does have an impac t on subjective sleep and well-being and this seems to apply even for healthy samples of you ng female adults. As a consequence, besides of considering the potential impact of dail y stressors in the treatment of sleep disorders, even young and healthy samples might pro fit from preventive actions concerning the regulation of stress and arousal. Especially, d ue to its mediating role, strategies targeting the reduction of arousal after stressful days, such as relaxations techniques or mindfulness, are 47 indicated. Future research should further examine t he roles of somatic and cognitive arousal on the inter- and intra-individual levels since thi s might help to target more specific interventions. Actigraphic SE was not impaired by stress and arous al in healthy young women, who might even be able to compensate for days with abov e average levels of stress and arousal during the subsequent night. This finding suggests that it might be useful to further explore the mechanisms causing this adaptive regulation in order to derive useful strategies for prevention. Still, it might also be possible that h igher levels of stress and arousal might not yet influence actigraphic sleep measures in a young and healthy sample but could still constitute a factor preceding the development of subsequent slee p disturbances (Fernandez-Mendoza et al., 2010; Jansson-Fr\u00f6jmark & Linton, 2008). Theref ore, it would be interesting to compare our findings with a group of healthy sleepers with a broader age range to investigate if stress and arousal do influence sleep more strongly with h igher age (i.e., if age moderates this relationship). Also, prospective research will have to show whether higher levels of stress and arousal constitute a risk for future sleep impairme nt. In order to gain additional knowledge, future studies on the above-mentioned topics should i n c l u d e m e a s u r e s o f P S G a n d u s e samples with more occupational diversity. The inver se effect of sleep quality or quantity of the previous night on stress reports during the nex t day might be equally important to fully understand the relationship between stress, arousal , and sleep, and therefore could be a topic for further investigation (Garde et al., 2011). T h e t w o a r t i c l e s o n l a b o r a t o r y s t r e s s r e s p o n s e s h o wed blunted endocrine as well as blunted SNS reactivity in association with more ACE s in healthy young women. Furthermore, it identified longer duration of ACEs as well as ag e of occurrence before menarche to be associated with blunted cortisol response during th e psychosocial stress task. Earlier age of first ACE occurrence was associated with blunted SB P reactivity on a trend level. In conclusion, these results confirm that ACEs are ass ociated with alterations in human stress response systems, even in the absence of current ph ysical or mental illness. Together with the evidence that blunted stress reactivity is associat ed with a variety of negative health outcomes (e.g. Chrousos, 2009; Lovallo, 2011) this would imp ly that blunted HPA and SNS reactivity serve as an important marker for future (psycho-) p athology and could indicate the need for appropriate preventive actions against those disord ers in order to keep the potential consequences of ACEs associated with blunted stress r e s p o n s e t o a m i n i m u m . T h i s i s mentioned besides the ubiquitous agreement that the reduction of ACEs, traumas, and adverse 48 living conditions would be the most optimal prevent ive action, which constitutes one of the most difficult but fundamental challenges of our so ciety. O n t h e o t h e r h a n d , i n o u r h e a l t h y s a m p l e A C E s c o r e s were on the lower end of the continuum and, according to above-mentioned theorie s, could have been low enough to stand for the promotion of development of stress resistan ce: it is argued that repeated significant, but not overwhelming stress exposure in early life promotes an attenuated stress response (Gunnar et al., 2009; Leitzke et al., 2013; Parker et al., 2006). Also, low stress response might have beneficial effects since it guards the individ ual against health outcomes associated with exaggerated response. For example, blunted sympathe tic stress response might from this point of view be protective regarding cardiovascular risk . In this case, it would be essential to further investigate the underlying factors, such as t h e i n t e n s i t y , f r e q u e n c y , a n d t y p e s o f stressors promoting stress resistance and adaptive responses to stress, but also corresponding mediating and moderating factors, including genetic s, epigenetic programming, as well as environmental factors. Knowing the underlying facto rs of adaptive responses might help to establish preventive actions and interventions rega rding the pathway of non-adaptive outcomes. For example, protective effects due to ma ternal care have been reported in both HPA and LC-NE systems (Liu, Caldji, Sharma, Plotsky , & Meaney, 2000) and knowledge about such mechanisms could help developing parenti ng programs. Since these considerations are speculative without longitudinal outcomes, only further research with prospective design can show whether blunted stress response represents a beneficial adaptation or is a predictor of long-term adverse health consequences. According to the adaptive calibration model propose d by Del Giudice et al. (2011), different responsivity patterns or phenotypes evolv e in adaptation to different stress environments in order to enhance survival and repro duction and are mediated by various factors, such as genetic and epigenetic alterations . This model may help to complete the picture and to integrate disparate findings in the literature. All proposed responsivity patterns represent the best possible adaptation in response to the environment but are nevertheless accompanied by costs of adaptation, such as negativ e health outcomes, which increase with more dangerous and unpredictable environments. Futu re research will have to further investigate those phenotypes and their potential co nsequences. Additionally, it will be important to further inves tigate the important issue of the relevance of the age of occurrence of ACEs. Our res ults were mixed, with ACE occurrence before menarche but not specific age of occurrence being associated with blunted endocrine stress response. Also, age of ACE occurrence was as sociated with blunted SBP reactivity on a 49 trend level. Future studies might profit from furth er systematic differentiation concerning the age of occurrence, including the investigation of m ore specific age groups (Bosch et al., 2012). It will also be crucial to answer the questi on whether there is evidence for a specific pattern of certain types of ACEs being associated w ith specific alterations of the stress response. Methodologically, it might be interesting to combine timing of ACEs and type of trauma, investigating age of ACE occurrence in samp les with a specific trauma or life-event. Additionally, further research is needed in order t o extend the knowledge about the exact locations and mechanisms concerning the neural dysr egulation, which is responsible for alterations in stress response, as well as the gene tic and epigenetic factors, which potentially influence those processes on various levels. While we assessed endocrine and autonomic function in the same sample and contribute to the knowledge about the specific natu re of ANS alterations after ACEs in the third article, more empirical research is needed, n ot only concerning the simultaneous examination but also concerning the coordination an d interactions between the endocrine, the immune and the two branches of the autonomic stress systems. Only a multisystem approach will help to understand the exact physiological cor relates of different health outcomes and accordingly, help to target specific interventions (Bauer et al., 2002). Importantly, due to evidence of ACEs being associat ed with exceeding stress response with corresponding vigilance and arousal in some sa mples (Chrousos, 2009; Heim et al., 2008), as well as hyperarousal playing a crucial ro le in the development of sleep disorders (Riemann et al., 2010), one could ask the question if ACEs, via the mediating path of altered stress response and hyperarousal, could also be ass ociated with sleep impairment in our sample of healthy young women. This topic was beyon d the scope of the present dissertation and should be further investigated. Still, in order to add to the picture, in our sample, we did not find an association between ACEs and sleep, whi ch further underlines the health and potential resilience of the sample and is in accord ance with our finding of not heightened but blunted stress response. 50 5.6. Conclusion The results of the present dissertation confirm the p o t e n t i a l d a n g e r o f d i f f e r e n t k i n d s o f stressors even in a healthy young sample. Enhanced stress and arousal significantly worsened subjective sleep quality and ACEs were associated w ith blunted endocrine and sympathetic stress response. On the other hand, as evidenced by higher actigraphic SE after above average stress, and the absence of negative health outcomes up to the present, stress did not impact our sample at all levels, which implies the presence of p r o t e c t i v e o r a d a p t i v e m e c h a n i s m s i n healthy young women. Understanding the underlying mechanisms in alterati ons and failure of stress response systems will aid in targeting interventions for per sons at risk, and exposure to ACEs seems to be one important factor in determining this potenti al risk. In conclusion, future research should focus on a longitudinal, prospective investi gation of endocrine as well as sympathetic and parasympathetic stress response in the context of ACEs. This will help to clarify whether blunted stress reactivity indicates a risk for nega tive health outcomes or might even be a sign of beneficial adaptation and as a consequence to ei ther identify specific preventive actions or the potentially adaptive features that may promote beneficial outcomes. Similarly, longitudinal studies are needed in order to establi sh whether stress and arousal influence subjective and objective sleep quality in the long term in previously healthy samples. Considering all this, discovering and establishing interventions with the aim to reduce the impact of chronic or exceeding stress on the st ress system (by preventing it from overreacting in the first place as well as subseque nt break-down), or even to improve dysfunctional stress regulation is a fundamental on -going challenge. Promising results show that family support, parenting programs, and improv ed caregiving environments for institutionalized children seem to have positive or n o r m a l i z i n g e f f e c t s o n s t r e s s r e s p o n s e systems (e.g. Cicchetti, Rogosch, Toth, & Sturge-Ap ple, 2011; Fisher, Stoolmiller, 2007). Furthermore, in healthy adult sam ples, cognitive-behavioural stress management proved effective in moderating neuroendo crine, psychological stress reactivity Sonderegger, S cherrer, & Ehlert, 2006), and stress management at the worksite has been successful in r eversing ANS dysregulation with possible preventive effects regarding hypertension (Lucini, Riva, Pizzinelli, & Pagani, 2007). 51 References Akerstedt, T., N., Petersen, H., Axelsson, J., Lekander, M., & Kecklund, G.

Methods: Multilevel modeling was applied on electronically assessed data comprising 14 consecutive nights in 145 healthy young women to assess the relationship between daily stress, presleep (somatic and cognitive) arousal, and sleep on both levels between participants and within participants across days. Results: Higher levels of daily stress were consistently and signicantly associated with higher levels of somatic and cognitive arousal. Somatic arousal mediated the relationship between daily stress and wors- ened subjective sleep quality on the between-participant level, while cognitive arousal mediated the rela- tionship between daily stress and worsened subjective sleep quality on the within-participants level. Unexpectedly, healthy young women showed higher SE following days with above-average stress with somatic arousal mediating this relationship. Conclusions: Our data corroborate the role of presleep arousal mediating the relationship between daily stress and subjective sleep quality. Interestingly this effect was restricted to somatic arousal being rele- vant on interindividual levels and cognitive on intraindividual levels. For young and healthy indi- viduals who experience high stress and arousal, well-established cognitive-behavioral techniques could be useful to regulate arousal and prevent worse subjective sleep quality. /C2112014 Elsevier B.V.

The point prevalence of primary insomnia is estimated to lie between 2% and 6%, though self-reported sleep disturbances in healthy popula- tions range up to more than 40% [1-5] . The impact of insomnia and other sleep disturbances is known to be severe and includes re- duced quality of life and well-being as well as impaired daytime- functioning and working ability, and thus is a potential risk factor for subsequent health problems [1,2,6] . Accordingly, insomnia and sleep difculties are associated with increased work absenteeism and healthcare costs [2-4,7] . Various psychological factors, such as stress, daily hassles, rumination, and hyperarousal have been found to play an essentialrole in the development of sleep disturbances [8-11] , but the search for the specic roles and interplay among these factors is still ongoing. Our study aimed to further investigate the relation- ship between daily stress and hyperarousal and the influence of both factors on sleep and sleep disruptions. Stress is one of the most common and well-known antecedents of insomnia and has been associated with impaired sleep in a vari- ety of ways. Previous research shows that minor and major stress- ful events correlate with more sleep disturbances [12-15] . Major stressors usually are described as life events, such as severe illness or signicant losses (e.g., death, divorce, work loss), and have been found to occur with greater incidence in the time preceding the on- set of insomnia or to be associated with increased risk for the development of sleep problems [14-17] . Minor stressors usually appear with higher frequency and more likely on a daily basis (e.g., arguments, time pressure, work demands), and they have been associated with more disturbed sleep [12,13,18,19] . Addition- ally long-term stressors such as childhood adversities have been 1389-9457/$ - see front matter /C2112014 Elsevier B.V.

Medicine 15 (2014) 359-366 Contents lists at ScienceDirect Sleep Medicine journal homepage: www.else vier.com/lo cate/sleep found to predict sleep problems several years later [20-24] . On a more acute daily basis, the experience of acute stress during the day was associated with impaired sleep the following night [25-30] . Well-established theories about hyperarousal and sleep postu- and cognitive arousal before bedtime is det- rimental for sleep and contribute to the worsening of sleep problems [31,32] . Cognitive arousal consists of intrusive cognitions experienced as being uncontrollable, and physiological or somatic arousal is described as the perception of vegetative arousal (e.g., elevated heart rate, sweating [33]). In an integrative model, Morin [31] indicated that hyperarousal has a causal influence on sleep disturbances. In this model, the balance between sleep and wake- fulness is regulated by the amount of arousal, and only low levels of arousal are compatible with sleep. Espie [32] further proposed that the inhibition of de-arousal processes in particular leads to the development of insomnia. Based on these theoretical frame- works, various studies tested the association between arousal and sleep and have conrmed that hyperarousal plays a major role in insomnia and sleep disturbances [10,11,34] . High arousal is more prevalent in poor than in good sleepers and can be measured on various physiological levels, such as sympathetic nervous sys- tem activation, hormone secretion, and high-frequency electroen- cephalogram activation [10,11,34] . In addition to the higher prevalence of arousal in insomniacs, there is evidence that high physiological and cognitive arousal also are prevalent in healthy populations and might constitute a preceding factor in the devel- opment of sleep disorders [35-37] . Even deliberately induced stress in the laboratory and the following increase in arousal at bedtime acutely worsen sleep in both poor and good sleepers [25,38,39] . Empirical studies on the relationship between stress and sleep on a day-to-day basis using within-participant data measured over time are still scarce. Garde et al. [40] found evidence for a bidirec- tional association between stress and sleep, indicating a self-rein- forcing vicious circle. In a representative sample of the Danish population, higher ratings of stress at bedtime were associated with ratings of poor sleep the following night. In addition, higher ratings of poor sleep in the morning were associated with higher ratings of stress during the subsequent day [40]. In a study by Han- son and Chen [41], the daily number of stressors reported by healthy young adults was associated with subsequent sleep time when moderated by family risk. On days with elevated levels of stress, sleep time was signicantly reduced the following night. Akerstedt et al. [30] studied the relationship between stress and sleep over a period of 6 weeks in 50 healthy adults. They found bedtime stress and worries to be the two main predictors of sub- jective sleep quality. Still the potentially mediating effect of arou- sal between stress and sleep was not tested in those studies. Morin et al. [8]tested the relationship between all three vari- ables and found a signicant relationship between daytime stress and nighttime sleep, with presleep arousal playing a mediating role. The authors collected prospective daily paper and pencil mea- sures for 21 consecutive days in men and women aged 19-60 years with insomnia in addition to good sleepers. Data showed that sub- jective stress during the day was a signicant predictor of self-re- ported subjective sleep quality the following night for both groups and higher levels of presleep arousal mediated this relationship. Objective sleep measures were not used in this study [8]. Our study aimed to extend these ndings on the relationship between stress, presleep arousal, and sleep considering various important aspects at the same time in a large healthy sample. Therefore, both subjective and actigraphic sleep measures were as- sessed and computerized diaries were used to enhance compliance and reliability compared to paper and pencil data [42]. Further- more, multilevel modeling was used to evaluate the relationshipon both levels (between participants and within participants across days). More specically, it was hypothesized that partici- pants reporting a higher level of stress compared to others also would experience a higher level of presleep arousal and compara- bly worse sleep (between-participant level). On the within-partic- ipant level, we expected that participants reporting a higher level of stress on a specic day compared to their own mean would experience higher presleep arousal and worse sleep the following night compared to days with a lower level of stress. It was further expected that presleep arousal would mediate the relationship be- tween daily stress and sleep. 2. Methods 2.1. Participants Data were collected in the context of a larger ongoing study about acute stress, emotion regulation, and sleep in young adults. Data for our analysis included a 2-week ambulatory assessment of sleep with actigraphic sleep measures and sleep diaries. The sample included young and healthy women (mean age, 21.7 \u00b1 1.6 [standard deviation {SD} years]) who were recruited using flyers posted at two schools for healthcare professionals in Basel, Swit- zerland, or by e-mails within the schools. Potential study partici- pants contacted the study ofce by e-mail or phone. They were rst sent a screening questionnaire with the following inclusion criteria: female sex, age range between 18 and 25 years, German speaking, and good health. Exclusion criteria for all participants included physical or psy- chiatric illness, pregnancy, regular and heavy tobacco use (>5 cig- arettes a day), use of illegal drugs, use of any medication interfering with sleep, and night shift work. In a rst ofce appointment, participants were further screened on inclusion and exclusion criteria and provided written informed consent. All remaining study participants were of either Swiss or German (86.9%) or other European nationality (13.1%), who received mon- etary compensation for their participation. The study was con- ducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local ethics committee. Out of 246 individuals who responded to the advertisements, 38 (15.4%) were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion requirements (men [ n= 5]; not meeting age criterion [ n= 4]; [ no regular sleep-wake n= 7]; heavy tobacco use [ n= 5]; and not German speaking [ n= 1]). Further 24 (9.8%) did not return the screening questionnaire. Of the 184 participants who were in- vited for the rst appointment, 23 (12.5%) dropped out due to time restrictions or personal reasons and 12 (6.5%) did not respond to repeated invitations. Out of the 149 individuals who came to the rst appointment, another three had to be excluded due to physi- cal illness ( n= 1), psychiatric illness ( n= 1), and dropout ( n= 1). The remaining 146 participants were nally eligible for the study and started the 2 weeks of assessment. All of the 146 participants completed the study and returned their material after 2 weeks, which corresponds to a total of 2044 actigraphy-recorded nights. The data set of one individual could not be used due to incomplete information about sleep and wake times (sleep parameters could not be reliably calculated). Three participants had two nights each for which sleep parameters could not be reliably calculated, in which case the data of those two nights were excluded. Nine participants reported illness during the 2-week assessment. Therefore, all nights affected by illness including one night of convalescence were excluded from analysis (a total of 49 nights). This response left data of 145 participants with 1976 nights (96.7%).360 K. Winzeler et al. / Sleep Medicine 15 (2014) 359-3662.2. Procedure All appointments took place in the laboratory of the CBT outpa- tient clinic of the Psychiatric Hospital of the University of Basel, Switzerland. Study volunteers were asked to wear the actigraphy device on their nondominant wrist and to complete their sleep logs every morning immediately after rising. Additionally daily stress and presleep arousal were measured every evening immediately before bedtime. After completion of the 2 weeks of ambulatory assessment, participants returned all material and were given their monetary compensation. 2.3. Measures 2.3.1. Clinical interview A structured clinical interview for psychiatric disorders (SKID I for DSM-IV; Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statis- tical Manual of Mental Disorders , fourth edition, [43]) was used to assess the absence of psychiatric illness. 2.3.2. Actigraphy Participants wore an ambulatory wrist actigraph (Micro Mini- Motionlogger, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY) for 14 suc- cessive days and nights on the nondominant arm. The Micro Mini- Motionlogger is capable of detecting arm movement through the use of an accelerometer and represents a useful instrument for detecting sleep-wake cycles [44]. Data were analyzed using the Software Package Action4 (Version 1.05) and the ACT Millennium (Version 3.47.0.3) software (Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY). For the calculation of sleep parameters, the Action4 scoring algorithm provided by the producers (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc. Ardsley, NY) was used. Sleep efciency (SE) was derived from this analysis and was calculated as the ratio of total time asleep to time in bed. Additionally daily sleep logs were completed by the participants to cross-validate sleep start and end times. Outcomes from wrist actigraphy have been repeatedly compared to polysom- nography (PSG) measures and represent a validated and unobtru- sive technique which provides accurate estimates of global sleep parameters and sleep-wake identication [44-46] . 2.4. Daily self-report measures A menu-driven computerized questionnaire was developed to repeatedly assess subjective estimates of sleep quality, daily stress, and presleep arousal. Palm Tungsten E handheld computers were used as recording devices. Questionnaires were programmed and displayed using Pendragon Forms 5.0 software (Pendragon Soft- ware Corporation, Buffalo Grove, IL). 2.4.1. Subjective sleep quality To assess subjective estimates of sleep quality, participants were instructed to ll in a computerized Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (very good sleep quality) to 5 (very poor sleep quality). For statistical analyses, the scale was reversed to have higher values for higher sleep quality. Participants completed this question in their handheld computers every morning after rising. Such Lik- ert-type scales are widely used to assess subjective sleep quality and have been shown to be highly correlated with (PSAS) [33] contains 16 items with eight symptoms of cognitive (e.g., intrusive thoughts) and eight symptoms of somatic (e.g., sweating) arousal experienced at bed- time. Ratings range from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). A total score from 8 to 40 is computed for both subscales with higherscores indicating higher arousal. We used a German translation similar to that used by Gieselmann et al. [48]. The PSAS has been broadly used and has shown satisfactory internal consistency and test-retest reliability [33]. Study volunteers completed the PSAS on their handheld computers every evening before bedtime. 2.4.3. Daily stress The Daily Stress Inventory (DSI) [49] (German version [50]) is a 58-item self-report questionnaire assessing the occurrence and the impact of 58 possible daily stressors. Participants specify which events occurred and, in case of occurrence, the impact of every event is rated on a Likert scale (1 = occurred, but was not stressful; 7 = caused me to panic). Three scores can be derived: the actual number of events that occurred during the day (frequency), the sum of impact ratings (total impact of all events), and the average impact rating (sum of all ratings divided by the frequency). Consid- ering that daily stress levels fluctuate, internal consistency and test-retest reliability are adequate [49,50] . The participants com- pleted this questionnaire on their handheld computers every even- ing before bedtime. 2.4.4. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [51] (German version [52]) was used to descriptively assess subjective sleep quality and potential sleep problems. Global scores of >5 distinguish poor sleepers from good sleepers [51,52] . The PSQI was administered twice: once at the beginning of the study period, examining the weeks prior to the study participation; and once at the end of the study period, examining the weeks of the study duration. This 2-fold application was used to investigate if sleep was signicantly influenced by the study participation (i.e., if sleep changed during the study period). 2.5. Data analysis Our study used daily data from 14 consecutive days. Because of the hierarchical structure of the data (days nested within partici- pants) and with the aim to be able to predict fluctuations from night to night in the variables, a multilevel modeling approach was used. Multilevel models are an extension of the general linear model and do not require observations to be independent. Because of their autoregressive nature and hierarchical structure, multi- level models are especially useful to study time-dependent changes [53-56] . By applying this approach, we were able to examine the relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep within and between participants. Analyses on the be- tween-participants level addressed the question if participants who experienced higher levels of daily stress also reported higher levels of arousal and worse sleep compared to participants report- ing lower levels of daily stress and arousal. Analyses on the within-participant level addressed the question if individuals reported higher arousal and worse sleep on days when they also reported above average stress levels compared to their individual average level. Here we used a multilevel structural equation model (MSEM), which represents an extension of the multilevel model (for details see [54]). MSEMs have been shown to lead to nonconflated estimates of between- and within-level components of indirect effects, thereby avoiding biased estimates which can occur when using more traditional multilevel models [54]. Note that in MSEM model based participant mean centering is used by default, i.e., the involved variables on the within-partic- ipants level denote deviations from each individual's mean. Our MSEM confers to a xed slopes model, i.e., only intercepts were al- lowed to vary between participants but not slope parameters. Allowing random slopes would have led to a more complex model, typically requiring more time points per participant. Note that weK. Winzeler et al. / Sleep Medicine 15 (2014) 359-366 361included time as additional predictor variable in all analyses to ac- count for temporal trends in the mediator and outcome variables during the 14-day period ( Fig. 1 ). The following steps were required to establish mediation in our study: (1) the predictor (stress) positively affected the mediator (arousal), i.e., awas signicantly higher than zero; (2) the mediator (arousal) negatively affected the outcomes SE and subjective sleep quality after controlling for the predictor (stress), i.e., bwas signif- icantly lower than zero; and (3) the indirect effect abwas signi- cantly lower than zero. In contrast to the common and well- known approach by Baron and Kenny [57] in 1986, this method of establishing mediation does not require the total effect of the predictor on the outcome variable to be signicant, i.e., cneed not be signicantly different from zero. This method enabled other mediating factors to influence the outcome in an opposite direc- tion, which then could result in the total effect cto be equal zero, thereby obscuring the assumed mediating effect [58-61] . Preliminary analyses were performed using SPSS (version 19.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) and R (version 2.15.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna) software packages. The MSEM was performed with Mplus (version 6.12; Mplus, Los Angeles, CA), which allowed assessment of the total, direct, and indirect effects on both hierar- chical levels. Prior to analysis, data were checked for multiple out- liers and were transformed to meet distributional assumptions. To identify highly influential data within our hierarchical dataset we used the R package Influence.ME [62]. For each analysis outliers dened by the Cook distance criterion were separately assessed and excluded. The number of outliers varied between 2 and 7. Sub- jective sleep quality and the stress variables number of events and sum of impact ratings were square root transformed, SE was log transformed, and cognitive and somatic arousal were reciprocally transformed. There were missing data for 70 nights (12 participants) due to technical failure of actigraphs and for 27 nights (13 participants), as participants either forgot to wear the actigraph or to report their bedtimes and wake times. In addition, there were missing data for 39 nights regarding subjective sleep parameters, for 32 nights regarding arousal measures, and for 30 nights regarding stress measures, as participants forgot to ll in the questionnaires on their electronic diaries. This response left 1855 nights (90.8%) with complete data for all analyses with actigraphy-assessed sleep mea- sures and 1916 nights (93.7%) with complete data for all analyses with subjective sleep measures. 3. Results 3.1. Stress, arousal, and sleep characteristics Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations for age, daily stress, and presleep arousal, as well as the subjective and acti- graphic sleep variables. The average PSQI score of 4.10 \u00b1 1.8 (SD)and a mean SE of 93.7% \u00b1 5.1% (SD) both indicate good sleep during the study period in our sample of healthy young women [51,52] . PSQI scores before the study period and at the end of the study did not signicantly differ from one another ( P> .5), indicating that sleep was not influenced on average by the study participation. 3.2. Between-participant effects Table 2 shows the results of the multilevel mediator model for subjective sleep quality and actigraphy-quantied SE on the be- tween-participant level. A strong positive relationship was found between stress and arousal in general (i.e., signicant results for parameter ain all 12 analyses performed; Pvalue of at least <.001). A signicant association between presleep arousal and sleep (parameter b) was only found for the relationship between somatic arousal and subjective sleep quality but not for any other mediator-outcome pair. As a consequence, there was only a signif- icant mediating effect ( absignicantly higher than 0) of somatic arousal for the relationship between stress (as expressed by all three types of measures) and subjective sleep quality. Thus partic- ipants who reported higher average stress compared to others also reported higher somatic arousal and worse subjective sleep quality. All other indirect effects tested did not yield signicance. In contrast to subjective sleep quality, somatic arousal did not appear to play a mediating role between stress and actigraphic SE, and cognitive arousal also did not appear to play a mediating role be- tween stress and both SE and subjective sleep quality. Note that the total effect of stress on sleep (parameter c) was negative and signicant in all 12 analyses performed, but the direct effect (parameter c0) was not signicant in 11 of 12 analyses. This nding suggests that, although most mediating effects tested were nonsig- nicant, they still had an impact in that their inclusion in the mod- el considerably reduced the total effect (compare cwith c0in Table 2 ). 3.3. Within-participant effects Table 3 shows the results of the multilevel mediator model for subjective sleep quality and actigraphy-quantied SE on the with- in-participant level. As seen for the between-participant level, there was a strong positive relationship between stress and arousal on the within-participant level (see signicant results for parame- terain all 12 analyses performed; Pvalue of at least <.001). Thus both cognitive and somatic presleep arousal also were increased on days with reported increased stress. Signicant associations between presleep arousal and sleep were found for the relationship between somatic arousal and actig- raphy-assessed SE, though in the unexpected direction of higher SE, as well as for the relationship between cognitive arousal and subjective sleep quality with increased cognitive arousal leading to decreased subjective sleep quality (see parameter b). As a conse- quence, there was a signicant effect ( absignicantly higher than 0) of somatic arousal for the relationship between stress as expressed by the sum of impact ratings, average impact rating, and (on a trend level, short of being signicant) by the num- ber of events and actigraphy-recorded SE. Additionally there was a signicant mediating effect of cognitive arousal on the relationship between stress as expressed by all three types of measures and subjective sleep quality. Thus subsequent SE also was increased on days with reported increased stress. This effect was signicantly mediated by somatic arousal. On days with reported increased stress, subsequent subjective sleep quality was decreased, which was signicantly mediated by cognitive arousal. Additional analyses revealed that the observed positive rela- tionship between stress and SE could be explained by the fact thatmx ya b c'cx y Non-mediated model Mediated model Fig. 1.

At the same time, increased stress compared to other days was not associated with total sleep time or time in bed the following night. Note that the total effects (parameter c) for the predictors number of events and sum of im- pact ratings were only slightly reduced, as shown by the corre- sponding signicant direct effects (parameter c0). Therefore, additional mediators are likely to account for the relationship be- tween stress and SE. A signicant positive temporal trend across the 14-day period was found for subjective sleep quality ( P< .001), whereas no such amelioration in the course of the study was detected for SE and for somatic and cognitive arousal, the two mediator variables ( P> .05 for all three variables). 4. Discussion In our study, we examined the relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep in a cohort of 145 healthy young women using multilevel structural equation models. Our results indicate and further extend previous ndings that presleep arousal plays an important role in mediating the effects of daily stress on sleep quality and SE in healthy young women. On the between- participant level, our results conrmed a mediating role of somatic arousal but not cognitive presleep arousal between daily stress and subjective sleep quality. Healthy young female participants who experienced higher levels of daily stress compared to other young female participants also experienced higher somatic presleep arou- sal and reported worse subjective sleep quality. However, there was no mediating role of presleep arousal between daily stress and actigraphy-assessed SE. On the within-participant level, results showed a mediating role of cognitive but not somatic presleep arousal between daily stress and subjective sleep quality. Participants reported worse subjec- tive sleep quality after days with above-average stress and cogni- tive arousal relative to their own mean. Further, results showed a mediating role of somatic but not cognitive presleep arousal be- tween daily stress and actigraphic SE in an unexpected direction. On days with higher levels of daily stress relative to their own mean, participants experienced higher somatic presleep arousal and showed subsequent higher SE during the following night as in- dexed by reduced wake time during sleep. The mediating role of cognitive arousal between daily stress and subjective sleep quality on the within-participant level, as well as the mediating role of somatic arousal between daily stress and subjective sleep quality on the between-participant level, are in accordance with our hypothesis. However, Morin et al. [8]also found a mediating role of somatic arousal on the within-partici- pant level, which we could not corroborate. On the between-par- ticipant level, previous ndings showed that not only somatic but also cognitive arousal was associated with sleep disturbance [20,35,39] . Possible explanations for this discrepancy may be due to the fact that our study volunteer sample of healthy women dif- fered from the sample of good sleepers of Morin et al. [8]regarding age and gender distribution. The sample of good sleepers of Morin et al. [8]consisted of 27 men and women of all ages (mean age, 33.7 years [range, 19- 60 years]), while our cohort consisted of 145 young women (mean age, 21.7 years [range, 18-25 years]). Additionally in accordance with our results, the authors mentioned that associations between arousal and subjective sleep quality were low [8]. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that our sample consisted of young andoverall good sleepers with no clinical sleep impairment, as con- rmed by the low PSQI scores. In addition, our women showed generally low levels of stress and arousal, which might further ex- plain why we did not nd arousal to signicantly influence sleep in several of our analyses. The use of computerized diaries in compar- ison to paper and pencil format also constitutes a signicant methodic difference. Stone et al. [42] found that computerized dia- ries enhance compliance compared to paper and pencil format, as participants are aware that times of diary entries are recorded. Based on the results of our study it seems that it is not higher somatic arousal on a daily individual level that influenced subjec- tive sleep quality, but rather higher somatic arousal on the interin- dividual level. On the other hand, it is not higher cognitive arousal on the interindividual level that influenced subjective sleep qual- ity, but rather higher cognitive arousal on a daily individual level. This result is plausible considering the role of de-arousal processes introduced by Espie [32], assuming that good sleepers do not have the same kind of negative sleep-related cognitive intrusions com- pared to individuals with sleep disturbances or insomnia; in addi- tion, they might be able to de-arouse more sufciently than others with the result that presleep cognitive activity does not influence subjective sleep quality enough to be noticed on the between-par- ticipant level. Although participants reported worse subjective sleep quality in association with higher stress and somatic arousal on the inter- individual level and with higher stress and cognitive arousal on the intraindividual level, this relationship does not seem to apply for actigraphy-assessed sleep data. Still this nding is not necessarily contradictory, as it is well-known that the subjective perception of impaired sleep is not always objectively measurable in acti- graphic or PSG sleep data [63-66] . Further, it might be possible that higher levels of stress and arousal might not yet influence acti- graphic sleep measures in a young and healthy sample, but it could still constitute a factor preceding the development of subsequent sleep disturbances [35-37] . Therefore, it would be interesting to compare our ndings with a group of healthy sleepers with a broader age range to investigate if stress and arousal do influence sleep more strongly with higher age (i.e., if age moderates this rela- tionship). Finally subjective sleep quality and actigraphy-recorded SE measure different aspects of sleep, which are not exactly com- parable. Actigraphy-assessed measures detect sleep-wake cycles by an accelerometer and objectively quantify sleep duration and number of awakenings, among others, in relation to the time spent in bed. Subjective sleep quality estimates include a variety of per- ceived sleep features, such as consciously perceived sleep disrup- tions, well-being, and sleep inertia on awakening, all entering the total perception of sleep resulting in a subjective rating. Interest- ingly participants even showed higher SE on days with above aver- age levels of stress and somatic arousal, which may indicate an adaptive response to stress. We consistently found higher levels of stress to be associated with higher levels of cognitive and somatic presleep arousal, which is in accordance with current models of insomnia, all including some sort of interplay between stress and arousal in the develop- ment of insomnia [10,31,32,67] . However, higher stress and arou- sal were not associated with lower actigraphic SE, which does not t into insomnia models on the rst sight. Still all models re- quire some sort of dysregulation or malfunctioning of the homeo- static or regulatory processes in the development of insomnia (e.g., de-arousal processes, sleep habits, chronobiologic timing, atten- tional focus, coping strategies) [10,31,32,67] . Therefore, it ts into the models that these homeostatic processes are still intact and sleep is not automatically impaired after experiencing higher levels of stress and arousal in a sample of healthy women without clini- cally signicant sleep impairment. The results on the level of sub- jective sleep quality did partially t the assumption of higher stress364 K. Winzeler et al. / Sleep Medicine 15 (2014) 359-366and arousal being associated with worse subjective sleep quality. Still it was only somatic arousal being relevant on the interindivid- ual level and only cognitive arousal being relevant on the intrain- dividual level. This nding remains difcult to explain and could be a topic for further research. It is important to note that there is evidence suggesting that the relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep is bidirectional. Garde et al. [40] examined the relationship between psychological arousal and sleep and found a self-reinforcing vi- cious circle, with sleep and arousal as a bidirectional association. For our analysis, we decided to focus on the effect of stress and arousal on following sleep, and thus concentrated on the direction that Morin et al. [8]examined in their analysis. Still the inverse ef- fect of sleep quality or quantity of the previous night on stress dur- ing the next day reports might be equally important to fully understand the relationship between stress, arousal, and sleep, and therefore could be a topic of further investigation. The positive temporal trend of subjective sleep quality over the 2 weeks of assessment could imply an initial reactivity bias to the start of the study habituating with time. Still time trends were included into the model and therefore did not signicantly influence our re- sults of mediation analysis. Our study bears some limitations: the acquisition of sleep data was based on actigraphy and subjective sleep measures. Despite the value of those data, studies using PSG would be useful to con- rm our ndings due to the high validity of PSG and its ability to consider additional dimensions of sleep. We deliberately examined a sample of healthy young women in the context of our larger ongoing study about acute stress, emotion regulation, and sleep in young adults. To generalize these results to the whole popula- tion of healthy adults, it will be necessary to replicate the study with good sleepers and a broader age range. The assessment of dai- ly stress and presleep arousal was based on subjective and self-re- port measures. Therefore, effects of memory and selective recall due to retrospective bias cannot be excluded in our study. Still par- ticipants assessed their stress and arousal levels on the same day to keep retrospective bias at a minimum and compliance with ade- quate time of entry was improved by the computerized diaries. Our sample consisted of young women attending schools for healthcare professions. It cannot be excluded that there is a sample bias in the direction that only individuals who are particularly resilient and capable of the demanding work in healthcare chose this kind of occupational career. Compliance was extraordinarily high in our sample, which sup- ports the assumption that the sample was resilient to additional stress and dedicated to social commitment. In addition, partici- pants with any psychiatric diagnosis or psychopathology were ex- cluded. This exclusion might further explain the low levels of presleep arousal and high SE in our sample. Finally it should be noted that ve (within-participants) and three (between-partici- pants) of the 12 statistical tests performed for indirect effects on each level yielded signicance, which was 8.3 and 5 times higher, respectively, than the value 0.6 (=12 /C3.05) to be expected by chance based on an aof .05 and independent tests. Despite these limitations, our study provides important knowl- edge regarding the relationship between daily stress, presleep arousal, and sleep. It conrms that arousal plays a mediating role between stress and subjective sleep quality, even in a healthy sam- ple of young women. This mediating role was restricted to somatic arousal being relevant on the interindividual level and cognitive arousal on the intraindividual level. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the rst to investigate between- and within-partici- pant levels, along with subjective and actigraphy-assessed sleep outcomes in young adults. Actigraphic SE was not impaired by stress and arousal in healthy young women, who might even be able to compensate for days with above average levels of stressand arousal during the subsequent night. This nding suggests that it might be useful to further explore the mechanisms causing this adaptive regulation to derive useful strategies for prevention.

Recently, attenuation in stress reactivity of thehypothalamic\u2014pituitary\u2014adrenal (HPA) axis and cardiovascular system have been related tothe number of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). We set out to investigate the associationof ACE duration and age of ACE occurrence on stress reactivity.Methods: 104 women in the age range 18\u201425 years (mean = 21.7) free of mental and physicalillness underwent psychosocial stress testing with the Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST).

Adverse life events in childhood, particularly if they occur repeat-edly and chronically, show a strong association with alterations in stress reactivity in adulthood,potentially predisposing for later mental or physical disorders.\u00a9 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionAdverse childhood experiences (ACEs), including physi-cal, emotional and sexual abuse, affect a signicantportion of the population and have been shown to berisk factors for the development and persistence ofmental disorders such as depression, anxiety disorders,substance use disorders, or attention-decit/hyperactivitydisorder . Changes in stress sensitivity and functioning of thehypothalamic\u2014pituitary\u2014adrenal (HPA) axis have been sug-gested as 2002; Tarullo and Gunnar ,2006; Heim et al., HPA axis, together with thesympathetic nervous system (SNS), are key players in theformation of the stress response (Chrousos, 2009). Mod-els of stress reactivity and health outcomes have thereforebeen a main focus in research towards understanding adver-sity and resilience processes. Different reactivity phenotypepatterns have emerged in different studies, with a numberof studies showing exaggerated HPA axis and SNS responsesin the context of contrast to ndings in clinical samples, a growingnumber of studies on healthy participants reported bluntedendocrine (Carpenter et al., 2007, 2011; Elzinga et al., 2008;Lovallo et al., 2012) and cardiovascular (Lovallo et al., 2012)responses in association with ACEs. For example, Carpenteret al. (2007) reported blunted plasma cortisol responses toa psychosocial stress test in a healthy sample with a his-tory of ACEs compared to participants without a history ofchildhood maltreatment. Also, a recent study by Lovalloet al. (2012) showed in a large sample of healthy partic-ipants diminished cortisol as well as heart rate responseswith an increasing number of adverse life events, indicatingan inverse dose-response relationship of ACEs and reactivityto a mental stress test.To the best of our knowledge, the association of ageof occurrence and duration of ACEs has not been investi-gated in healthy samples so far . There is evidence that thesefactors could have a differential impact on stress reactiv-ity in (Tarullo studiesused brief self-report questionnaires or life events checkliststo assess ACEs (e.g. Carpenter et al., 2011; Lovallo et al.,2012), questions of duration of the events or the respec-tive age when they happened widely remain unanswered.From a developmental perspective, age at traumatizationis believed to be an important factor (Bosch et al., 2012).Brain components involved in stress response show largeplasticity during pre- and postnatal periods and duringearly childhood, and some plasticity during later child-hood and adolescence (Fumagalli et al., 2007; Andersenet al., 2008). Also, the duration of adverse experiencescould be associated with psychobiological constructs. Par-ticularly those environmental events that cause exceedingor prolonged stimulation of the stress system during thesecritical developmental periods could be linked to abnormalneurodevelopment and therefore be risk factors for lastingalterations in stress reactivity of the HPA axis and the SNS(Schoedl et al., 2010).Therefore, the aim of the present study was to repli-cate the ndings of attenuated endocrine and cardiovascularstress reactivity in association with a history of ACEs ina young, healthy, female adult sample. Furthermore, weaimed to investigate the association of duration as well asage of occurrence of adverse life events in childhood andadolescence with the stress reactivity in adulthood. To elu-cidate the association of age of occurrence and duration,in this study, the Early Trauma Inventory-Self Report (ETI-SR) served as a more detailed method in measuring ACEs(Bremner et al., 2007). The questionnaire retrospectivelyassesses a wide range of stress and trauma exposure beforethe age of 18 and considers age of occurrence as well asduration of the events.In contrast to Lovallo et al. (2012) who employedstandard public speaking and mental arithmetic stressors,and in contrast to the standardly used Trier social stresstest (TSST , (Kirschbaum et al., 1993), we used the Mon-treal imaging stress task (MIST), that has been developedto be compatible with functional magnetic resonance brainimaging (Dedovic et al., 2005), but can be used in labora-tory stress studies as well (La Marca et al., 2011). The MISToffers a promising alternative to conventional psychosocialstress tests. Advantages of the MIST are that participants sitstill during the stress protocol and do not speak, thereforecausing fewer artifacts measuring psychobiological parame-ters like heart rate or electrodermal activity. Furthermore,since the MIST is considered to evoke a moderate endocrinestress response, the observed ndings represent HPA activityclose to naturalistic settings (Smyth et al., 1998).2. Methods and materials2.1. ParticipantsThe sample included 104 young and healthy females in theage of 18 to 25 years (M = 21.7; SD = 1.5), recruited at threeschools for health care professions and social work in Basel,Switzerland. The sample was part of an ongoing project,which included only female participants. The recruitmentmaterial referred to a 14-day sleep assessment describingthe nature and prevalence of sleep and sleeping disorder anddid not include explicit statements about childhood traumaor adverse childhood experiences.Exclusion criteria were current physical or psychiatricillness, pregnancy, regular and heavy tobacco use (>560 A. Voellmin et al.cigarettes a day), the consumption of illegal drugs, and theuse of medication that interferes with the central nervousor the adrenocorticoid system.Furthermore, participants were requested to minimizephysical exercise during the hour preceding the labora-tory examination and not to take large meals, coffee, orcigarettes. For participants taking no oral contraceptives,the laboratory assessment was held in the luteal phase ofthe participant's menstrual cycle (Kirschbaum et al., 1999).Participants received monetary compensation for theirparticipation and provided written informed consent priorto participation. The ethical principles of the Declarationof Helsinki were followed and the study was accepted bythe local Ethics Committee. All appointments took place ina laboratory of the Psychiatric Clinics of the University ofBasel, Switzerland.2.2. ProcedureAfter a preliminary screening assessment, participantsreported to the laboratory for the stress examination, whichtook place between 3:30 pm and 6:00 pm to control forcircadian variation and lasted for approximately 2.5 h. Par-ticipants were told that the laboratory assessment wouldinclude a test on cognitive performance.Upon arrival, participants were seated in a comfortablechair in front of a table with a computer screen and sev-eral magazines. After the heart rate sensors were attached,a ten minute resting period followed to customize partic-ipants with the laboratory. Then, a baseline measurementwas conducted for ve minutes. Immediately before thebaseline measurement, participants provided the rst salivasample. Another saliva sample was collected immediatelybefore participants engaged in the MIST . Following the stressexposure, a recovery period was conducted during which veadditional salivary cortisol samples were collected togetherwith self-report measures of the participants' emotionalresponse to the stress task. At the end of the laboratory test-ing, participants were debriefed and signed a second writteninformed consent to approve the further use of their data.2.3. Stress inductionThe MIST (La Marca et al., 2011) was used to induce a psy-chosocial stress response. The MIST (Dedovic et al., 2005) isa standardized psychosocial stress test during which partici-pants have to solve arithmetic tasks displayed on a computerscreen under time pressure and social evaluation. The soft-ware adapts the difculty of the tasks to the individualperformance level of each participant, so that it is notpossible to correctly answer more than 45\u201450% of the arith-metic tasks in the experimental condition. Participants hadto complete three experimental runs, each lasting four min-utes.To induce a social evaluative threat, participants are toldthat their performance has to be close or equal to the aver-age performance of a normative sample that is shown onthe top of the computer screen, and that otherwise, theirdata cannot be used for the research purposes. Also, partic-ipants are informed that the study leader is watching theirperformance next door . Furthermore, after each of the rsttwo runs, to further enhance social evaluative threat, thestudy leader informs participants that their performance ispoor . In concrete terms, after the rst experimental run, theexperimenter calls the study leader to ask what to do in suchan unusual situation. The participant then is told to repeatthe task and to do better . Then, after the second unsuccess-ful performance, the slightly annoyed and demanding studyleader enters the laboratory and interrogates the partici-pant about her individual reasons for her poor performance.The study leader explains the high costs of the experimentin case of a possible exclusion if the participant does notachieve a better performance. Then, the last run of the MISTstarts while the study leader stays in the room and watchesthe subject's performance standing right behind her .These behaviors were standardized and practiced beforestudy onset.2.4. Measures2.4.1. Biological measuresSaliva was collected at seven measurement points, whereoftwo took place before the stress test (10 and1 min) andve after the rst stored at 22C, then thawed andcentrifuged at 3000 rpm, before cortisol concentration insaliva was determined by enzyme immunoassay (ALPCODiagnostics, Salem, USA). Because of unexpected high val-ues, cortisol concentration was reanalyzed with a moreestablished commercially available chemiluminescenceimmunoassay with high sensitivity International, Ham-burg, The intra- and interassay coefcients forcortisol were below rate was using 3 data acquisitionsystem (TEMEC Instruments B.V ., Netherlands). 2248-50, 3F Health Care, Germany)on disposable electrodes. A samplingrate of 1024 Hz was used for ECG recordings with a low passlter of 512 Hz and a high pass lter of 0.5 Hz. Anslab, asoftware for scientic analysis of data, wasused to analyze detected consecutive R-waves and calculateR\u2014R intervals, which were transformed to heart rate (Auto-nomic nervous system laboratory, Wilhelm & Peyk, 2005).Heart rate was averaged for Baseline, Stress 1, Stress 2,Stress 3, and Recovery periods in reference to time markersmanually set in accordance with the various sections of theexperiment.2.4.2. Psychological measuresA diagnostic screening including the German version ofthe ''Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV/Axis I Disor-ders'' (SCID-I) was conducted in order to detect and excludeparticipants suffering from a mental disorder (Wittchenet al., 1997). Lifetime history of mental disorders (n = 9)was assessed. Participants reported to have suffered fromdepression (n = 7), panic disorder (n = 1), and posttraumaticstress disorder comorbid with depression (n = 1) and werefully remitted at the time of the study. Relevant data includ-ing age, medication, drug consumption, age of menarche,Blunted endocrine and cardiovascular reactivity in young healthy women reporting a history of childhood adversity 61Table 1 Participant characteristics and ACE scores of the study sample (N = 104).Variable M SD Range/%Age [yr] 21.66 1.54 18\u201425Age of onset 12.95 1.28 use, n (%) 59 21.81 2.53 18.37\u201431.14Depressive symptoms 2.76 0\u201415General trauma 1.43 1.63 0\u20147Physical abuse .53 .99 0\u20145Emotional abuse .54 1.25 0\u20146Sexual abuse .26 .57 0\u20143ACEs 1 year 1.27 2.40 0\u201412ACEs < 1 year 1.44 1.55 0\u20146ACEs before menarche 1.96 2.99 0\u201415ACEs after ACE occurrenceb7.54 4.83 0\u201416an = 103.bn = 80 (no experienced ACE, n = 23; no reported age of occurrence, n = 1).BMI, date of last menstruation, and intake of hormonal con-traceptives were also assessed during the interview.ACEs before the age of 18 years were assessed ret-rospectively using a German translation of the ''EarlyTrauma Inventory-Self Report'' (ETI-SR) (Bremner et al.,2007), which includes general trauma (31 items), physical(9 items), emotional (7 items), and sexual abuse (15 items).The ETI-SR has been demonstrated to be a valid measure ofearly trauma, and has shown high internal consistency in alltrauma domains (Cronbach > 0.7) (Bremner et al., 2007).Participants were asked a series of questions concern-ing potential trauma and stress exposure, which theyanswered with yes or no. Next, on positively answereditems, age of occurrence, frequency of trauma or abuse, andemotional impact (0 = no negative impact, 1 = slightly neg-ative, 2 = moderately negative, 3 = strongly negative) wereassessed. In total, ve different ACE scores were built. First,a sum score was computed from all events rated with anemotional impact of at least 1 (ACE total sum score). Fur-thermore, a sum score for ACEs lasting less than a year(ACEs < one year) and for ACEs lasting more than a year(ACEs > one year) was computed. Age of occurrence wasassessed in two ways. In a rst step, events which occurredbefore or after a participants' menarche were summed upto ACEs before and after menarche, respectively. Next, ageof rst ACE occurrence was abstracted for each subject,while the emotional impact of at least ''slightly negative''was considered. ACE mean scores of the study sample aredepicted in Table 1.Because the ETI-SR does not provide cut-off scores forgrouping, for illustration purposes, evenly distributed quar-tile groups (ACE total groups) were built via rank function ofSPSS for the ACE total sum score. The grouping via rank func-tion resulted in the following group distributions: group 1 = 0ACE, group 2 = 1 ACE, group 3 = 2\u20143 ACEs, and group 4 = 4 ormore ACEs. Groups with regard to duration were then builtaccording to the same group distribution as for the ACE totalgroups.Depressive symptomatology was assessed via the Germanversion of the Center scales (VAS) for mood, tension, and stressserved as measures of subjective emotional response ofparticipants during the psychosocial stress test. The scalesranged from good mood'' (0) ''having a bad mood''(1 0 0), respectively.2.5. Data analysisStatistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statis-tics, version 20 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statisticswere conducted for all variables. Skewed data were loga-rithmically transformed where appropriate.First, repeated measures general linear model (GLM) wasused to assess if the stress task led to a signicant stressresponse for the dependent variables salivary cortisol, heartrate, as well as for the subjective emotional responses to theMIST . Next, GLMs for repeated measures served to deter-mine the effects of ACEs on endocrine and cardiovascularresponses. In these models, the ACE total sum score as wellas the different scores for duration and age of occurrencewere used as continuous variables to examine effects oftime, ACE scores, and the interaction of time by ACE scores.In a second step, in order to visualize the results, the dif-ferent ACE groups were then used as xed factors for theGLMs, respectively.To protect against violation of sphericity,Greenhouse\u2014Geisser corrections were applied whereappropriate. Effect sizes were determined by partialeta-square, reflecting small (.01), medium (.06), or large(.14) effect sizes (Green et al., 2000).To account for their potential confounding influence oncortisol concentration (Kirschbaum et al., 1999), BMI and62 A. Voellmin et al.use of oral contraceptives were included as covariates inall statistical models. In this sample, depressive symptomswere overall low and were neither related to cortisol, heartrate nor ACEs and therefore not controlled for in the anal-yses. Also, lifetime history of mental disorders (n = 9) wasnot related to the outcome measures and therefore notcontrolled for in the analyses. Emotional responses to theMIST (mood, tension, stress) were entered as covariates inpost-hoc analyses, using the trapezoid formula for calcula-tion (area under the curve with respect to ground, AUCg;Pruessner et al., 2003).Technical difculties with Vitaport 3 data acquisition sys-tem led to data loss in heart rate measurements (missingcompletely at random). Eventually, heart rate measures of88 participants were available and went into the analyses.Cortisol data of four subjects had to be excluded becauseof unlikely high and fluctuating values, or because of acuteillness, and therefore, cortisol measures of 100 participantswent into the analyses.3. ResultsDemographic and trauma characteristics of the sample aredisplayed in Table 1. According to univariate analyses ofvariance, the ACE groups did not differ signicantly interms of demographic characteristics (e.g. age, age ofonset of menarche, oral contraceptive use, and depressivesymptoms). However , for the ACE total groups, BMI was sig-nicantly higher [p = .02] in women reporting 4 or more ACEs(M = 23.38, SD = 3.55) compared to women reporting no ACEs(M = 21.16, SD = 2.07).Results obtained by GLM repeated measure analyses indi-cated that the stress task induced a robust and signicantincrease in cortisol levels [F(1.87, 185.52) = = 28.45, p < .001;/DC1p2= .22] (Fig. 1). Regarding their emotional reaction to theMIST , participants did not show differences in their base-line and peak levels in relation to the total number of ACEs,as indicated by univariate analyses of variances (data notshown).Furthermore, the associations of the subjective emo-tional responses to the MIST with cortisol and heart rateresponses were tested. Results revealed no signicant corre-lations (all p > 1). Depression symptom scores and ACE totalsum score were uncorrelated (r = .11, p = .27).3.1. Association of ACE and cortisol responses tostressRepeated measures analysis of cortisol responses to stressshowed a signicant interaction of time \u00d7 221.60) = 5.89, p < .001; /DC1p2= .06] as well asa signicant main effect of ACE total sum score [F(1,95) = 7.52, p < .01; /DC1p2= .07]. Results remained signicantwhen the emotional responses to the stress task wereentered additionally as covariates. Results are depicted inFig. 2. Fig. 1 Subjective emotional responses to the MIST .(aTimepoints relative to the MIST: t1 = 1 min, min, t6 = +55 min.).Next, it was tested whether the duration of ACEs wasassociated with the cortisol responses to the stress task.Repeated measures analysis of cortisol response to the stresstask resulted in a signicant main effect of duration ofACEs > one year [F(1, 95) = 10.10, p < .01; /DC1p2= .10] and a sig-nicant interaction of time and duration of ACEs > one year[F(2.33, 221.16) = 5.36, p < .01; /DC1p2= .05] (Fig. 3). Resultsremained signicant when the emotional responses to thestress task were entered additionally as covariates. How-ever , these effects were not observed for the associationbetween ACEs that lasted shorter in duration (ACEs < oneyear) and cortisol responses to the stress task [main Fig. 2 Cortisol responses to the MIST are depicted for womenwho experienced 0, 1, 2\u20143 or 4 or more ACEs.

DiscussionWe set out to assess the association of ACEs and psychobi-ological stress reactivity and its modulation by the number ,duration and age of occurrence of ACEs in healthy youngwomen. Our results are in line with previous reports of Fig. 4 Heart rate responses to the MIST are depicted forwomen who experienced 0, 1, 2\u20143, or 4 or more ACEs. Val-ues represent average heart rate (beats per minute) \u00b1 standarderror of the mean for the ACE total groups controlled fororal contraceptive use and BMI. Higher ACE sum scores areassociated with attenuated heart rate reactivity. (aTimepointsrelative to the MIST: Heart rate averaged for Baseline (5 min),Stress 1 (rst run), Stress 2 (second run), Stress 3 (third run),and Recovery period (rst 5 min after last run).).attenuated endocrine (Carpenter et al., 2007, 2011; Elzingaet al., 2008; Lovallo et al., 2012) as well as cardiovascu-lar (Lovallo et al., 2012) stress responses to a psychosocialstress test in healthy adults with a history of adverse child-hood experiences. Furthermore, our results substantiate theimportance of the mean number of ACEs on endocrine andcardiovascular response to psychosocial stress. Importantly,blunted cortisol and heart rate responses were indepen-dent of emotional responses, suggesting that the diminishedendocrine and cardiovascular stress reactivity cannot beexplained by a reduced emotional reaction to stress (whichmay be interpreted as flattened affect) after a history ofchildhood adversity.To the best of our knowledge, the present study is therst to demonstrate that in healthy young women, especiallylong enduring, chronic ACEs show the strongest associationwith a blunted cortisol reactivity, adding valuable knowl-edge to the link between chronic childhood adversity andalterations of the HPA axis. Even though the sum of eventswhich occurred before menarche showed an association witha blunted cortisol reactivity, whereas events after menarchedid not, in this sample, the specic age of occurrence didnot contribute to a further understanding of the associationbetween timing of ACEs and endocrine and cardiovascularreactivity.Per se, our results show a deviation from an expectedendocrine and cardiovascular stress response in partici-pants free of mental and physical illness in associationwith a history of ACEs. According to Obradovic (2012),taking together recent ndings on stress reactivity in thecontext of early adversity, it is more accurate to statethat exposure to early life stress may lead to dysregulatedphysiological phenotypes rather than to a particular pat-tern of hyper- or hyporesponsivity (Obradovic, 2012). Therecently proposed adaptive calibration model (Del Giudiceet al., 2011) offers an evolutionary-developmental theory A. al.individual differences in physiological reactivity processes.The authors hypothesize that, at a very general level, anonlinear relation between adverse life event exposure andstress response exists. However , in the context of highadversity, the model predicts an either vigilant prole,characterized by high biological stress responsiveness, oran unemotional, underresponsive prole, characterized bygenerally low HPA axis and SNS activity. Thus, these oppo-site phenotypes might be mediated by other factors andtheir interactions, e.g. the study sample, the type of mal-treatment or the interaction of various environmental andgenetic factors.In terms of environmental factors, studies have demon-strated that the HPA axis in early human development isunder strong social regulation (Tarullo and Gunnar , 2006).Therefore, several reactivity 2006). Thus,sensitive parenting appears to buffer cortisol responses infearful situations, whereas being deprived of an evolution-arily expectable level of care (e.g. institutional rearing) hasbeen associated with blunted cortisol production (Carlsonand al., 2001). However children were also able to show thatimproved caregiving environments had an effect on nor-malizing dampened HPA diurnal rhythms (Dozier et al.,2008; al., Fisher et al., 2011).The social buffering of the HPA axis is supported byndings in animal models. In their extensive summary of lit-erature, Hostinar et al. (2014) report ndings from animalstudies, which suggest that neural mechanisms are respon-sible for behavioral and neuroendocrine changes due tosocial buffering (Hostinar et al., 2014). Findings from animalstudies report changes in the development of the HPA axisand its function in social buffering. In early development,a stress hyporesponsive period (e.g. Witek-Janusek, 1988)during which the mother strongly controls the infants corti-costerone levels has been reported, which can be disruptedby maternal deprivation and result in a hyperresponsiveHPA pattern. In later stages of development, peers canalso become a source of social buffering (Hennessy et al.,2009). For example, social input has been shown to dampenHPA axis reactivity in rat pups if the mother was present(e.g. Stanton and Levine, 1990; Shionoya et al., 2007), inmaturing rodents when cohabitating companions are present(Terranova et al., 1999), or in squirrel monkeys in the pres-ence of familiar and unfamiliar conspecics (Vogt et al.,1981; Hennessy, 1984).The ndings in human and animal studies provide sup-port for an adaptive response of the stress system to itsenvironment, probably in order to enhance survival odds.It could be speculated that after an initial hypersecre-tion of cortisol due to chronic stressful environments, theHPA axis could counter-regulate its response and cortisoloutput might rebound to below normal. A plausible bio-logical explanation could be an increased glucocorticoidnegative feedback with a downregulation of CRF recep-tors, or a diminished release of cortisol by the adrenalglands (Heim et al., 2000a; Fries et al., 2005). This viewis supported by our nding that only chronic events, notacute events, were associated with a blunted cortisolresponse.Recent studies link genetic and epigenetic alterations tostress reactivity in association with ACEs as well. A historyof ACEs has been associated with an epigenetic regulation ofthe glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus (McGowanet al., 2009). Moreover , a recent study on healthy adults whoexperienced the loss of a parent during childhood, maltreat-ment, or low parental care showed epigenetic alterations ofa region of the human glucocorticoid receptor gene, whichin turn was associated with a blunted cortisol reactivityafter a neuroendocrine challenge test in these participants(Tyrka et al., 2012). Another study linked prenatal maternaldepression to increased methylation of the glucocorticoidreceptor gene, and showed exaggerated salivary cortisoloutput to stress at 3 months of age (Oberlander et al., 2008).Further studies are needed to investigate these changes incentral regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor in brainregions involved in stress responses in association to ACEs.Our results raise the challenging question of whetherthe observed alterations in stress responsivity can be inter-preted as a potential risk factor for or as a sign of resilienceto the development of later mental and physical disor-ders. Even if initially adaptive, blunted cortisol reactivitycould compromise future and necessary psychobiologicalstress reactivity. For example, low cardiovascular and/orendocrine reactivity to acute psychological stress has beenassociated with depression, bromyalgia, obesity, burn out,substance use disorders, and chronic pain syndromes (Griepet al., 1998; Heim et al., 1998; 2000; Gold and Chrousos, 2002; Gur et al.,2004; Phillips et al., 2011; Jones et al., 2012).Considering that participants in the present study wererecruited from a school of higher education and were freeof psychopathology in adulthood, they may have beenselected in a way that the blunted stress reactivity patternmay stand for resilience to the development of mentalillness in the aftermath of childhood adverse experiences.Longitudinal, population-based research is needed to inves-tigate if participants without present psychopathology, whohad shown blunted stress responses after stress induction,are at higher risk to develop psychiatric disorders later inlife or remain healthy.The present study revealed diminished heart rateresponses in association with the total number of ACEs,but not with the subgroups regarding duration and age ofoccurrence. Recently, Bauer & Boyce have suggested theexamination of the HPA axis and the SNS simultaneously fora better understanding of their coordination (additive orinteractive; or opposing or complementary) (Bauer et al.,2002). Only few studies have examined the exact nature oftheir coordination in adult samples so far (Ali and Pruessner ,2012; Lovallo et al., 2012; Andrews results are mixed. Methodological differences betweenthe reported studies could account for the different ndings.More empirical research is needed to investigate the exactnature of SNS alterations after ACEs, as well as the coordi-nation and interactions between the two stress systems.Our results revealed no associations of the specic ageof occurrence, which contrasts to ndings of other studies.Bosch et al. (2012) reported that especially ACEs in pre-and postnatal developmental stages were associated withheightened cortisol reactivity (Bosch et al., 2012). However ,their sample included 16-year old adolescents, and alsoBlunted endocrine and cardiovascular reactivity in young healthy women reporting a history of childhood adversity 65included concurrent psychopathology. In contrast to thepresent study, which used age of rst ACE occurrence, andthe distinction pre- and postmenarche, the authors usedmore distinct age groups to examine the association ofage and cortisol reactivity. A limitation of our approach,by using the specic age of occurrence, is that type oftrauma is neglected. Type of trauma is an important factor ,which could also explain different HPA axis phenotypes.Future studies are needed to further analyze timing ofACEs, and methodologically, this might be assessed best in asample of participants with one specic severe trauma/lifeevent. Furthermore, a limitation of the present study isthat no data on pre- and postnatal stress exposure wasincluded. Prenatal maternal stress (Entringer et al., 2009)and postnatal adversity (Bosch et al., 2012) have beenassociated with increased HPA responses to stress, whichcould result in a sensitization to stressors in long-term.Another limitation of the present study is that onlyperipheral readouts of stress hormone activation were mea-sured. The HPA axis and the cardiovascular system arecomplex and multilayer systems and therefore we are notable to identify the exact mechanisms or location of theobserved dysregulations. Furthermore, that only womenwere recruited and tested has to be mentioned as anotherpotentially limitating factor . Especially as some of therecent models on stress reactivity changes after chronic ortraumatic stress make mention of sex differences, it wouldhave been informative to assess the stress response in menas well (Bangasser , 2013). Thus, due to the characteris-tics of the study sample, the presented ndings can onlybe generalized to young women free of mental and physi-cal illness. Also, participants were attendees of schools forhealth care professions and social work, which could haveled to a selection bias as outlined above. Also, even thoughHardt and Rutter (2004) concluded in their review of studiesfrom 1980 to 2001 that the validity of retrospective recall ofsexual/physical abuse, physical/emotional neglect or familydiscord could especially reported eventsin toddler and pre-verbal ages.Because of methodological reasons, the specicationbetween ACEs shorter/longer than one year cannot beassumed to be completely independent from each other .Since some participants reported both, acute and chronicACEs, with our sample size, it was not possible to have fullydistinct and statistically orthogonal groups.Despite these limitations, the present study strengthensthe assumption that adverse childhood experiences give riseto a blunted stress reactivity of the HPA axis and the SNSin young healthy women. In this study population, num-ber and duration of adverse events in childhood showed thestrongest association with an attenuated stress response inadulthood. These ndings suggest that the reactivity of thehuman stress system is indeed shaped by the experience ofextrinsic chronic stressors in childhood and adolescence.ContributorsKlaus Bader (PI) and Frank H.

Abstract Objective: Early adversity has been associated with alteration s of psychobiological stress systems and negative health outcomes. While a previ ous report demonstrated blunted cortisol and heart rate stress reactivity in association wit h adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in healthy young women (Voellmin et al., 2015), the pr esent secondary analysis aimed at clarifying the role of the sympathetic and parasymp athetic branches of the autonomic nervous system in this relationship. Methods: 129 healthy young women provided retrospective dat a on the occurrence of ACEs and underwent psychosocia l stress testing. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RS A) were assessed during baseline and stress tasks as measures of sympathetic and parasym pathetic cardiovascular activity, respectively. Results: Higher number of ACEs was correlated with blunted S BP stress reactivity (r= -0.295, p=0.001) and a trend for low er baseline SBP (r= -0.159, p=0.072). No significant association was found between ACEs and RSA baseline or reactivity after controlling for respiratory rate. Conclusions: Childhood adversity was associated with down- regulation of sympathetic but not parasympathetic c ardiovascular stress responsivity in adulthood. Future research will need to clarify whe ther this indicates a risk for negative health outcomes or, quite on the contrary, is a sig n of stress resistance developed during childhood and adolescence. Keywords: systolic blood pressure, sympathetic nerv ous system, vagus nerve, childhood adversity, trauma. Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! Introduction Early adversity has been associated with alteration s of psychobiological stress systems and various adverse health outcomes (e.g., !Gilbert et al., 2009; Miller, Chen, & Parker, 2011) . In a recent study we found blunted endocrine and heart rate reactivity to a stress task in association with adverse childhood experiences (ACE s) in healthy young women (Voellmin et al., 2015). Since heart rate is regulated by bot h sympathetic (increase) and parasympathetic (decrease) efferent activity of the autonomic nervo us system, it remains unclear whether this blunted heart rate reactivity is caused by sympathe tic hyporeactivity or less parasympathetic withdrawal, or a combination of both (Berntson, Cac ioppo, & Quigley, 1991). The present secondary analysis of data from this study aimed at clarifying the role of the sympathetic (indexed by systolic blood pressure, SBP) and the p arasympathetic (indexed by respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) cardiovascular stress respon sivity in association with adverse childhood experiences in healthy, young women. ACEs have been shown to constitute an important ris k factor for the development and persistence of mental and physical health problems often conceptualized as stress-related disorders (e.g. !Felitti et al., 1998; Wegman & Stetler, 2009). Thes e detrimental consequences of early adversity are supported by findings from a nimal models showing higher risk for pathology in association with early-live stress (Sa nchez, Ladd, & Plotsky, 2001). Changes in the functioning of stress response syste ms due to repeated or long-lasting ACEs or trauma have been suggested to be the cause for higher vulnerability to stress-related disorders. Current models assume that ACEs have the potential to alter patterns of endocrine and autonomic discharge in the long-term by disturb ing the complex and integrated system of positive and negative feedback-loops, thereby creat ing a state of allostatic load that potentially results in adverse health outcomes (see for review: Chrousos & Gold, 1992; Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! Lovallo, 2011; McEwen, 1998). Importantly, initial evidence and theoretical considerations suggest that allostatic load can take either the di rection of failure to shut off the stress response and a resulting chronic hyperactivity but also the direction of failure to mobilize a full response and a resulting blunted pattern (Lova llo, 2011; McEwen, 1998). From a developmental perspective, age at stress exp osure is believed to be an important factor, since there is evidence for devel opmental periods with high sensitivity for the formation of enduring alterations in stress res ponsivity (Tottenham & Sheridan, 2010). During prenatal and early postnatal life the brain grows rapidly and therefore is characterized by high plasticity, which then slows down during ch ildhood and adolescence (Charmandari, Kino, Souvatzoglou, & Chrousos, 2003). Since a stress response in heart rate and other org anismic functions is often comprised of both, sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal, both branches of the ANS may play a role in regulating stress-induced arousa l (Berntson et al., 1991). Sufficient blood supply to muscles and other organs during stress re sponding is assured by up-regulation of blood pressure. Particularly systolic blood pressur e (SBP) is known to be regulated almost exclusively by the sympatho-adrenal axis via beta-a drenergic receptors and thus constitutes a putative index of sympathetic cardiovascular activi ty (Obrist, 1981; Silvestrini & Gendolla, 2011). On the other hand, respiratory sinus arrhyth mia (RSA), referring to the rhythmic oscillation of heart rate linked to the phases of t he respiratory cycle, indicates the efferent activity of the parasympathetic nervous system inne rvating the heart, or cardiac vagal (Berntson et al., 1997; Grossman, Stemmler, & Meinh ardt, 1990). Spectral analysis of heart rate variability over several minutes within the fr equency range of 0.15-0.50 Hz, the frequency band typically associated with respiratio n (also termed high frequency heart rate variability), has been established as the method of choice for quantifying RSA (Camm et al., 1996; Grossman et al., 1990). Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! Elevated tonic sympathetic activity has frequently been reported in samples with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and persistent autonomic hyperarousal is considered to be a core symptom of the disorder (e.g., !Blechert, Michael, Grossman, Lajtman, & Wilhelm, 2007; Buckley & Kaloupek, 2001; Kirsch, Wilhelm, & Goldbeck, 2011). In non-clinical samples, similarly elevated tonic sympathetic activ ity has been found in association with adversity in some studies (Lee, Tsenkova, & Carr, 2 014; Paulus, Argo, & Egge, 2013; Su et al., 2014) while others have found no baseline diff erences in heart rate or systolic blood Pollak, 2013; Lovallo, F Sorocco, Cohoon, & Vincent, 2012). Concerning sympathetic stress reactivity, results are mixed in samples with PTSD with either heightened (Heim et al., 2000) or blunt ed heart rate or electrodermal responses to acute stress (Blechert et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 2000). In non-clinical samples, some studies have produced evidence for heightened SNS reactivit y in response to stressors (Oosterman, de Schipper, Fisher, Dozier, & Schuengel, 2010; Ott e et al., 2005). On the other hand, two studies reported blunted cardiovascular responses t o a social stress task in association with ACEs: Lovallo et al. (2012) showed diminished heart rate responses with an increasing number of adverse life events in a large sample of healthy participants (N=354) while Leitzke et al. (2013) found blunted systolic blood pressure response in maltreated compared to non- maltreated youth (total N=111). Concerning adversity and parasympathetic regulation there is evidence for lower tonic RSA in association with both, non-clinical samples with the experience of ACEs (Dale et al., 2009; Miskovic, Schmidt, Georgiades, Boyle, & MacMi llan, samples with PTSD (Blechert et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 1997). C oncerning RSA withdrawal in response to stressors, Cohen et al. (1998) found that in partic ipants with PTSD, RSA did not change from rest to trauma recall compared to a withdrawal of R SA in controls. In non-clinical samples, there is evidence for lower RSA stress reactivity o r lower recovery in the context of adversity Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! (Arditi-Babchuk, Feldman, & Gilboa-Schechtman, 2009 ; Dale et al., 2009). However, these patterns might be complicated by different factors, such as family environment, mediating or moderating the relationship between ACEs and RSA, e specially in children and adolescents. Also, there is evidence that tonic RSA or RSA stres s reactivity themselves constitute moderating factors between early adversity Adle r, & Boyce, 2010). Still, others found no differences in RSA baseline or reactivity in ass ociation with ACEs (Shenk, Putnam, Rausch, Peugh, & Noll, 2014; van Ockenburg et al., 2014). Some of the divergent findings may be due to the fa ct that studies differ regarding sample characteristics, age groups, type of adversi ty, and stressors assessed. Many studies on RSA have focused on children and adolescents and ha ve examined RSA as a mediator between ACEs and other outcome variables. Other stu dies have used clinical samples with the problem of comorbid symptomatology or have not examined parasympathetic in addition to sympathetic indices of stress response. Further, some of the inconsistencies in prior findings might be the result of inadequate adjustme nt for confounding factors such as respiratory rate, physical fitness, or depressive s ymptomatology (Grossman & Taylor, 2007). To our knowledge, there is no study so far that has examined the association between sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular stre ss response and ACEs in otherwise healthy young adults. In accordance with the study by Lovallo et al. (201 2), a recent study from our research group also found blunted cardiovascular stress resp onse in association with ACEs in healthy young women (Voellmin et al., 2015). However, this does not allow drawing conclusions about the relative contributions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems in blunting the heart rate response during stress. The refore, the present study had two major objectives: First, it aimed at clarifying the role of the sympathetic and parasympathetic Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! cardiovascular stress response in the observed blun ted heart rate reactivity in association with ACEs. Second, it aimed at extending previous findin gs on sympathetic and parasympathetic influences by investigating the relationship betwee n ACEs, SBP, and RSA both during a resting baseline (being considered a snapshot of to nic, trait-like activity) and in reaction to a psychosocial stress task in healthy young women and by ensuring consideration of potentially confounding variables. The Early Trauma Inventory-S elf Report (ETI-SR; (Bremner, Bolus, & Mayer, 2007) served as a validated and detailed m ethod for measuring ACEs. We expected that participants with higher number of ACEs would show either blunted sympathetic (in terms of SBP) response or less parasympathetic (in terms of RSA) withdrawal, or both, in response to a psychosocial stress task. Any of thes e autonomic response patterns would explain the blunted HR reactivity in association wi th ACEs we recently observed in the current sample. Based on the relatively inconclusiv e picture from previous studies regarding baseline differences, we did not have a strong expe ctation that baseline SBP and RSA would show a relationship with ACEs in the present analys is. However, because several studies point at increased sympathetic activity and decreas ed parasympathetic activity, if anything, baseline SBP may be expected to be higher and basel ine RSA to be lower in women reporting more ACEs. We additionally analysed the association between the age of first ACE occurrence and measures of SBP and RSA and expected earlier age of ACE occurrence to accentuate alterations in stress reactivity. Also, different ACE subscales (general trauma, physical, emotional, as well as sexual abuse) and t heir association with SBP and RSA were explored in order to be able to compare the effects of different types of adversity within the same sample. Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! Method Participants Data for the present analysis were collected in the context of a larger study investigating acute stress, emotion regulation, and sleep. The sa mple included 146 young and physically as well as mentally healthy women (mean age 21.7 \u00b1 1.7 years) who were recruited at three schools for health care professions and social work in Basel, Switzerland. Potential study participants contacted the study office by email or phone and had to be female, aged between 18 and 25 years, German speaking, and in good healt h. Exclusion criteria for all participants included current physical or psychiatric illness, p regnancy, regular heavy tobacco use (> 5 cigarettes a day), consumption of illegal drugs, an d the use of any medication interfering with the autonomic nervous or the adrenocorticoid system . A structured clinical interview for psychiatric disorders (SCID I for DSM-IV; Structure d Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder , fourth edition, Wittchen, Wunderlich, Gruschwitz, & Zaudig, 1997) was used to assess the absence of psy chiatric illness, followed by a structured interview about physical illness and the other excl usion criteria. Participants received monetary compensation of 150 CHF for their particip ation and provided written informed consent prior to participation. The study was condu cted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the local medical ethi cs committee. Procedure All appointments took place in the laboratory of th e cognitive-behavioral treatment outpatient clinic of the Psychiatric Hospital of the Universit y of Basel, Switzerland. At a first office appointment participants were screened for inclusio n and exclusion criteria, and provided information on ACEs. On the second appointment, par ticipants reported to the laboratory for the stress examination. They were told that the lab oratory assessment would include a test on Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! cognitive performance and were requested to minimiz e physical exercise during the hour preceding the laboratory examination and to avoid l arge meals, coffee, or cigarettes. In order to control for circadian variations, the laboratory examination started in the afternoon between 3:30 pm and 6:00 pm (Stone et al., 2001) an d lasted for approximately 2.5 hours. Upon arrival, participants were seated in a comfort able chair, approximately 30 inches in front of a computer screen (21 inch diameter). A fter all sensors for psychophysiological measures were attached, a ten minute resting accomm odation period followed. Then, a resting baseline measurement was conducted for five minutes. After baseline, a paced breathing task was conducted. The participants were instructed to breathe in and out in 5 second intervals according to audiotaped instructio ns. The tonal pattern was designed to induce a respiratory frequency of 12 cycles per min ute and was presented for 1 minute. This procedure has been recommended to standardize respi ration rate between individuals during assessment of individual differences in resting RSA (Grossman et al., 1990; Wilhelm, Grossman, & Coyle, 2004). Participants then engaged in the stress task, which was followed by a recovery period. At the end of the laboratory testing, participants were debriefed and the nature and goals of the preceding stress induction task were fully disclosed. Participants provided a second written informed consent approvin g the further use of their data. Stress induction The Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST; !Dedovic et al., 2005) is a standardized computer- supported psychosocial stress task and consists of a series of arithmetic challenges that need to be solved by entering the correct numbers on the keyboard, combined with social- evaluative threat. The software manipulates the dif ficulty of the arithmetic questions and the time limit, ensuring that no more than 45-50 % of t he questions are answered correctly. Participants are further pressured by the constant display of their current individual Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! performance in contrast to the (fictitious) expecte d performance of their age group. Also, they are informed that the investigator is watching thei r performance online next door. There are three experimental runs, each lasting for four minu tes with feedback of 2 3 minutes in between the three runs. After each of the first two runs, to further enhance social evaluative threat, the participants are reminded first by the investigator and then by the principal investigator that their performance was poor and ar e asked to do better. In contrast to other often used psychosocial stress tasks like the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST, !Kirschbaum, Pirke, & Hellhammer, 1993), the MIST does not requi re speaking during stress assessment. This ensures that respiratory pattern change (steep , short inspiration and long expiration, Wilhelm, Handke, & Roth, 2003) due to speaking cann ot interfere with RSA assessment. Physiological Measures Systolic blood pressure was assessed using an ambul atory blood pressure monitor (Aponorm\u00ae Basis Control, Germany) during the last m inute of baseline and about 30 seconds after the start of each of the stress runs. A baseline-to-stress reactivity score was computed by subtracting systolic blood pressure at baseline from systolic blood pressure during the stress task (mean of all three stress ru ns). Cardiovascular and respiratory data were collected using the Vitaport 3 data acquisition system (TEMEC Instruments B.V., Netherl ands). Data reduction and editing of artifacts were performed using ANSLAB, a software f or scientific analysis of physiological data (Autonomic Nervous System Laboratory, Wilhelm & Peyk, 2005, Wilhelm, Grossman, & Roth, 1999). Both RSA and mean respiratory rate w ere determined for baseline, paced breathing, and the three experimental stress runs. These intervals were defined by markers manually set and recorded in the course of the expe riment. RSA withdrawal was computed Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! by subtracting baseline RSA from RSA during the str ess task (mean of all three stress runs). Therefore, higher values stand for less RSA withdra wal (less decrease of RSA). ECG data acquisition: Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings were acquired u sing electrode placement on the thorax in a standard Lea d II configuration with three disposable electrodes. The raw ECG signal was recorded with a sampling rate of 1024 Hz and a high pass filter of 0.5 Hz. ECG data reduction: ECG data were filtered offline with a low pass filt er of 40 Hz and R-waves were identified in the continuous ECG s ignal using an automated software algorithm. This algorithm estimated the time point of the R-wave using a threshold technique applied to the filtered and detrended ECG signal. C orrection of missed or misidentified R- waves or ectopic extrasystoles was afterwards manua lly performed in ANSLAB and R-wave times were then converted to inter-beat intervals ( IBIs). Successive IBIs defined the heart period series, which was resampled into continuous equal time intervals of 250 ms using cubic-spline interpolation and saved to disc for th e subsequent analyses of heart period variability due to RSA. RSA analysis: To compute RSA, edited IBI time series were linear ly detrended and power-spectral densities for each experimental peri od were computed in the 0.15 to 0.5 Hz frequency band using the Welch algorithm (Welch, 19 67), which creates ensemble averages of successive periodograms. Averages from spectra e stimated for 60-s segments, overlapping by half, were derived. For each 60-s segment, 256 p oints, which includes 240 sampled points with zero padding, were included. The segments were Hanning-windowed and subjected to fast Fourier transform. Estimates of power were adj usted to account for attenuation produced by the Hanning window and distributions were normal ized by natural-logarithm transformation. Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! Respiratory rate was assessed in order to be able to include it as covariate in statistical analyses to account for its potential confounding i nfluence on RSA in within-subject change analyses (Grossman & Taylor, 2007). Respiration pat tern was recorded with a 128 Hz sample rate using an inductive plethysmograph (Respiband, Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, NY) applied around the upper rip cage. Onsets of re spiratory cycles were identified automatically in ANSLAB using an automated algorith m. Instantaneous respiratory rate (in cycles per minute, cpm) was then calculated as 60 d ivided by the time difference between successive respiration cycles and averaged for each experimental phase. Psychological Measures Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) before the age of 18 years were assessed with a German translation of the Early Trauma Inventory Se lf-Report questionnaire (ETI-SR, Bremner et al., 2007), which includes 31 items on g eneral trauma exposure (e.g., natural disasters, death of close person, separation of par ents), 9 items on physical abuse, 7 items on emotional abuse, and 15 items on sexual abuse. Even ts were summed up to a total score of occurred events (ACE total score), which could rang e between 0 and 62. For exploratory purposes, separate scores were computed for the fou r subscales. Additionally, age of first occurrence was assessed for each reported event and the variable age of first ACE occurrence was determined for each subject by taking the earli est age of onset across all items and domains. The ETI-SR has shown high internal consist ency (Cronbach ! = 0.78-0.90) as well as good validity in all trauma domains (Bremner et al., 2007). Symptoms of depression were assessed with the Germa n version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Ge rman version: ADS-K, Hautzinger & Bailer, 1993). In order to obtain an approximate in dex of physical fitness (which may influence autonomic parameters) participants were a sked to rate their degree of physical Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! activity during a typical week. Scores ranged from 1 (inactive), 2 (active daily routine), 3 (light sports activity), 4 (moderate sports activit y), 5 (intensive sports activity), to 6 (competitive sports activity). Data Analysis Analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20.0; S PSS, Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics were conducted for all variables. Prior to analysis, data were checked for outliers and were transformed logarithmically or by square r oot function where appropriate in order to meet distributional assumptions. The !-level was set at 0.05 for significant findings in all primary analyses. To examine whether the stress task induced signific ant increase in SBP and decrease in RSA, a paired samples t-test was conducted. Cohen's d is reported as a measure of effect size. Pearson correlations were used in order to ex amine the relationship between ACE total score as well as age of first ACE occurrence and in dices of sympathetic and parasympathetic functioning (i.e., SBP at baseline, SBP reactivity, RSA at baseline, and RSA reactivity). Analyses of respiratory rate showed that some parti cipants were breathing at a rate slower than 0.15 Hz, but that all participants' breathing rates were within the frequency band between 0.12 to 0.5 Hz throughout the different exp erimental phases. Thus, following recommendations of Grossman and Taylor (2007), we a djusted the lower boundary of the frequency range used for assessment of RSA to 0.12 Hz. This assures that spectral HRV measures within this band capture RSA activity adeq uately. Partial correlations were performed for RSA reactiv ity controlling for the potentially confounding influence of changes in respiratory rat e from baseline to stress condition (Grossman & Kollai, 1993). We did not adjust for re spiration for baseline RSA, as such respiratory adjustment is less useful for individua l difference analyses where people differ in Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! basal respiratory function due to factors unrelated to vagal activity, such as basal metabolic rate and respiratory pacemaker function (Grossman & Kollai, 1993; Grossman & Taylor, 2007). However, we included a 12-cpm paced breathin g task that standardizes respiratory rate during baseline assessment and calculated the Pears on correlation for the relationship between paced breathing RSA and ACE total score. In this sample, there was no significant association between either SBP, RSA or ACEs and the two potentially confounding variables, current depressive symptomatology and physical fitn ess, and therefore they were not controlled for in the analyses \"! Exploratory analyses were used to examine the assoc iation between the four ACE subscales and SBP as well as RSA using a more conse rvative p<0.01 significance criterion to reduce type-I error. Since distributional assumptio ns were not met for all ACE subscales, non-parametric Spearman correlations were conducted . While all of the 146 participants completed the stu dy, two participants had to be excluded due to acute illness during the laboratory session and one participant because she had not eaten for several days before the stress ta sk due to religious reasons, which left data of 143 participants. Technical difficulties with th e data acquisition system led to data loss in RSA measurements of 14 participants (missing comple tely at random). Thus, for 129 participants all relevant data were available and w ent into analyses. Respiratory measures were missing for 11 participants due to technical f ailure of the respiration sensors (missing completely at random). These were excluded in analy ses using respiratory rate as a covariate (remaining n=118). Since not all participants were able to adhere to the specified paced breathing rhythm the sample was further reduced for the analysis concerning paced breathing (remaining n=104). Note that the sample size was al so reduced for physical fitness since data were only available for part of the sample (remaini ng n=118), and also for analyses Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! concerning age of first ACE occurrence since a scor e on this measure could not be obtained for participants not reporting any ACEs (remaining n=114). Results Sample characteristics for age, years of education, A C E s , s y s t o l i c b l o o d p r e s s u r e , R S A , respiratory rate, ADS-K, and physical fitness are d isplayed in Table 1. Results from paired samples t-tests indicated that the stress task had high pote ncy and induced significant increase in SBP ( t (128) = -23.87, p = .000, d = 1.59) as well as decrease in RSA ( t (128) = 9.63, p = .000, d = 0.82). ***Insert Table 1 about here *** Relationship between ACEs and SBP A significant negative correlation was found for AC E total score and SBP reactivity. For ACE total score and SBP at baseline, there was an a ssociation being short of significance (see Table 2). Specifically, higher ACE total score was associated with lower SBP reactivity as well as a trend for lower SBP at baseline (see Figu re 1). ***Insert Table 2 about here *** ***Insert Figure 1 about here *** Relationship between ACEs and RSA No significant correlation was observed for ACE tot al score and RSA at baseline (see Table 2). Also, ACE total score was not associated with R SA during paced breathing condition ( r = 0.161, p = 0.102). There was a significant association between ACE tot al score and RSA reactivity (see Table 2). Specifically, higher ACE total score was associated with lower RSA reactivity. However, when respiratory rate reactivity was contr olled for, the association between ACE total score and RSA reactivity was no longer signif icant ( r = 0.123, p = 0.188). Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! Age of first ACE occurrence Pearson correlations showed a significant associati on between age of first ACE occurrence and SBP reactivity (see Table 2). Specifically, ear lier ACE occurrence was associated with lower SBP reactivity (see Figure 2). Age of first A CE occurrence correlated moderately with ACE total score ( r = - 0 . 2 9 8 , p = 0 . 0 01 ) . Wh e n to t a l s c o r e w a s e n t e re d as a c o va r i ate, the association between age of first ACE occurrence and SBP reactivity was short of significance (r = 0.183, p = 0.052). Also, there was an association being sho rt of significance with earlier ACE occurrence being associated with lower RSA reac tivity (see Table 2). Again, this association was no longer significant after control ling for respiratory rate ( r = - 0 . 1 3 1 , p = 0.190). No significant associations were observed f or the relationship between age of first ACE occurrence and SBP at baseline or RSA at baseli ne. ***Insert Figure 2 about here *** Exploratory analysis of ACE subscales Spearman correlations showed a significant associat ion between general trauma and SBP reactivity (see Table 3). Specifically, higher ACE score in general trauma was associated with lower SBP reactivity ( ! = -0.282, p = 0.001). Using the more conservative criterion of p < 0.01, no further significant associations betwee n ACE subscales and SBP baseline, RSA baseline and RSA reactivity were observed. ***Insert Table 3 about here *** Discussion In this study, we examined the relationship between ACEs and SBP and RSA at baseline as well as in response to a psychosocial stress task i n a sample of healthy, young women. The current results extend our previous finding of blun ted heart rate reactivity in response to the stress task by clarifying the role of the sympathet ic and parasympathetic branches of the Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! ANS. Our results show blunted SBP reactivity in ass ociation with higher numbers of ACEs, indicating down-regulation of phasic sympathetic st ress response. No significant association was found between ACEs and RSA reactivity after con trolling for respiratory rate changes, which indicates that blunted heart rate response wa s not appreciably influenced by alterations in parasympathetic functioning. In addition to blun ted SBP reactivity, participants with higher number of ACEs showed a trend for lower SBP at baseline. Additionally, we found blunted SBP reactivity in as sociation with earlier age of occurrence. This implies that the finding of blunte d SBP reactivity in the context of ACEs applies particularly to participants with early ACE occurrence, which is in accordance with the hypothesis that earlier developmental periods c ould be especially sensitive for lasting alterations in stress response (Charmandari et al., 2003; Tottenham & Sheridan, 2010). Yet, the association was only short of significance afte r controlling for ACE total score. The total number of ACEs and the age of first occurrence of A CEs are not independent from each other since it is known that early ACEs/ traumatisation e nhances the probability of future adversity (Desai, Arias, Thompson, & Basile, 2002). The finding of blunted SBP at baseline as well as b lunted SBP reactivity is contrary to several findings of heightened sympathetic baseline activity and reactivity in clinical and non-clinical samples with adversity al., 2000; Otte et al., 2005; Su et al., 2014). Still, the result of blunted reac tivity is in accordance with the findings of Lovallo et al. (2012) and Leitzke et al. (2013), wh o reported blunted heart rate or SBP reactivity in their samples. Lovallo et al. (2012) explain their finding with altered functioning of stress systems towards a blunted response, and a rgue that deviations from the norm in either direction (exaggerated or diminished stress reactivity) might signal a system's loss of efficient allostatic regulation. This is in accorda nce with theories of allostatic load (McEwen, 1998) as well as with evidence of adverse health ou tcomes in association with blunted stress Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! response (see for review: Carroll, Lovallo, & C., 2 009; Gold & Chrousos, 2002; Lovallo, 2011). Leitzke et al. (2013) consider the possibili ty of useful adaptation as an explanation for their finding of blunted systolic blood pressure re activity in youth. They argue that an attenuated stress response might be adaptive in the context of repeated significant, but not overwhelming stress exposure because it reduces chr onic activation, fearfulness and psychophysiological activity & Van Ryzin, 2009; Leitzke et al., 2013). One may add tha t brief intermittent stress exposure rather than zero-stress environments in early life induces subsequent stress resistance, which is referred to as stress inoculation (Parker, Buckmast er, Sundlass, Schatzberg, & Lyons, 2006). In our healthy sample, ACE scores were on the lower end of the continuum, which indicates that the dosage of stressful experiences in the hig h-ACE individuals was still low enough to promote development of stress resistance. It is lik ely that much higher ACE scores would have the opposite effect. This is in accordance wit h the recently proposed adaptive calibration model (Del Giudice, Ellis, & Shirtcliff, 2011), whi ch predicts a nonlinear relation between exposure to adversity and stress response, with mod erate stress environments leading to a buffered responsivity pattern while dangerous or un predictable environments would lead to a vigilant responsivity profile. Since our considerat ions are speculative without long-term health outcomes, only further research with prospec tive design can show whether blunted SNS stress response represents a beneficial adaptat ion or is a predictor of altered stress responsivity with long-term adverse health conseque nces. H i g h c a r d i a c v a g a l a c t i v i t y d u r i n g s t a t e s o f c a l m has been associated with higher physiological and behavioural flexibility as well a s with high ability of social engagement, while appropriate withdrawal (greater decrease) of vagal influence during demanding situations enables cardiovascular mobilisation and corresponding reaction (Kok & Fredrickson, 2010; Porges, 2007). We found a signif icant association between ACEs and Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! RSA reactivity, whereby higher ACE scores correlate d with blunted RSA reactivity (i.e., vagal withdrawal). This is in accordance with studi es indicating impaired parasympathetic withdrawal or slower recovery in response to demand ing situations in samples with adversity or PTSD (Arditi-Babchuk et al., 2009; Cohen et al., 1998). However, after controlling for the severely confounding influence of within-subject ch anges in respiratory rate (Grossman & Taylor, 2007), the correlation was no longer signif icant. This indicates that in our sample of healthy young women, change in parasympathetic func tioning to stress did not depend on the number of ACEs and that the blunted heart rate reac tivity previously found (Voellmin et al., 2015) was primarily due to reduced sympathetic reac tivity. Also, no significant association was found between ACEs and RSA at baseline (during spontaneous as well as paced breathing), indicating that healthy young woman did not differ in tonic vagal activity irrespective of the number of ACEs they had experie nced. Although there is evidence showing lower baseline RSA in association with adve rsity (Blechert et al., 2007; Cohen et al., 1997; Dale et al., 2009), many of these studies inv olved clinical samples or were conducted with children or adolescents, while our finding is in accordance with results from a representative sample of the Dutch population showi ng no differences in RSA measures at rest in the context of ACEs (van Ockenburg et al., 2014). In exploratory analyses we found evidence for an as sociation between blunted SBP reactivity and more incidences of general trauma, s uch as natural disasters, death of a close person, or separation of parents. Findings regardin g the association of different types of adversity and ANS functioning are still scarce, but Lovallo et al. (2012) reported emotional adversity to be related to smaller heart rate respo nses. More studies have been conducted concerning endocrine stress response (Carpenter, Sh attuck, Tyrka, Geracioti, & Price, Heim, Newport, Mletzko, Miller, & Hemeroff, 2008) b ut results are mixed with significant effects for different types of adversity in differe nt samples. In conclusion, to our knowledge, Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! there is not yet consistent evidence for a specific pattern of certain types of ACEs being associated with specific alterations of the stress response. The present study bears some limitations: We delibe rately examined a homogenous sample of healthy young women in the context of our larger ongoing study about acute stress, emotion regulation, and sleep in young adults. Neve rtheless, our results are in accordance with findings of blunted blood pressure in samples with younger age, mixed gender and ethnicity (Leitzke et al., 2013; Lovallo et al., 20 12). Our sample consisted of young women attending schools for health care professions, whic h could imply that there is a sample bias in the direction that only individuals who are particu larly stress-resilient and feeling capable of coping with the demanding and straining work in hea lth care chose this kind of occupational career. Compliance was very high in our sample, whi ch supports the assumption that the sample was resilient to additional stress and dedic ated to social commitment. Also, participants with psychiatric diagnosis or physical pathology had been excluded and this may have restricted the range of ACEs and stress reacti vity. Further, the assessment of ACEs was based on subjective and retrospective self-report m easures. Therefore, effects of memory as well as selective recall due to retrospective bias cannot be excluded. Still, retrospective recalls of sexual and physical abuse, as well as ph ysical and emotional neglect, have been evaluated to be sufficiently valid (Hardt & Rutter, 2004). Despite these limitations, the present study provid es important knowledge regarding the relationship between ACEs and sympathetic as we ll as parasympathetic cardiovascular stress response. Strengths of the study are its rel atively large sample size and control for potentially confounding variables. Also, the confin ement of the sample to physically and mentally healthy young women allowed to investigate the association between ACEs and stress response in a homogenous non-clinical sample , free of psychiatric comorbidities and medications interfering with stress system assessme nt. The study extends our finding of Early adversity and sympathetic stress responsivity ! blunted heart rate reactivity in response to a stre ss task previously reported (Voellmin et al., 2015) by showing blunted SBP reactivity but not blu nted RSA reactivity in association with more ACEs in healthy young women, indicating down-r egulation of phasic sympathetic stress response but no alteration of parasympatheti c functioning with ACE. Understanding the underlying mechanisms in alterations and partia l failure of stress response systems will aid in targeting interventions for persons at risk, and exposure to ACEs seems to be one important factor in determining this potential risk . Future research may focus on prospective investigation of the relative contribution of sympa thetic and parasympathetic regulation in the context of ACEs, which would help clarify whether b lunted stress reactivity indicates a risk for negative health outcomes or might even be a sig n of beneficial adaptation, and as a consequence to either identify specific preventive actions or the potentially adaptive features that may promote resilience.
