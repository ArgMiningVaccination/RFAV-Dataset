A growing number of parents are refusing to have the the vaccine given to their children, and Congress last year called for more research. For the new study, researchers led by Dr. James A. Kaye, an epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Medicine, examined data that include almost all children born in the United Kingdom from 1988 to 1993. The vaccine was introduced in 1988, and was in widespread use by the time the children born that year reached 15 months, the typical age for the shot. In an interview, Dr. Kaye said that if the M.M.R. vaccine had a major effect on autism incidence, lines tracking the proportion of children vaccinated and the proportion diagnosed would be expected to move in tandem. Instead, the researchers found that the vaccination level stayed essentially flat, at 97 percent, while among boys the risk of having an autism diagnosis between the ages of 2 and 5 rose to 29 per 10,000 for those born in 1993 from 8 per 10,000 for those born in 1988. Dr. Kaye said earlier studies had seized on an increase during the years the M.M.R. shot was being introduced to suggest a link. ''But if the risk of disease is still going up, and the rate of vaccination isn't, you can't say that the vaccine is still accounting for the increase in risk,'' he said. Instead, Dr. Kaye suggested that the increase in incidence of autism could be linked to an ''increased awareness of the condition among parents and general practitioners, changing diagnostic criteria or environmental factors not yet identified.'' Thursday A brief report in the Vital Signs column of Science Times on Tuesday about possible links between a vaccine and autism misstated the scope of the General Practitioners Research Database, on which a new study was based. It comprises detailed information on some four million children and adults, not almost all children born in the United Kingdom. How we handle "}
