Homeopathy can be an important part of a gentle detoxification program that safely cleanses the organs without side effects. A Detox Plan Here is a safe and simple detox plan: - Start with a 3-5 day juice fast (drinking only fresh fruit and vegetable juices and water). Twice daily take Psyllium Husk. It acts as a natural laxative. - Eliminate alcohol, cigarettes, coffee, refined sugars and saturated fats. - Drink plenty of water (8- 14 glasses a day) - Eat high fiber organic fruits and vegetables. - Take Vitamin C - it helps the body produce glutathione, a liver compound that drives away toxins. - Take twice daily a probiotic. - Practice deep breathing exercises for 10 minutes a day. - Take a daily contrast shower. After taking a hot shower and feeling warm, turn down the temperature so that it gets cooler and then wash your body in this cold water for about a minute. Then switch back to the hot shower for the next two to three minutes. Repeat this cycle at least three times with each cycle ends with the cool shower. - Use a homeopathic detox for at least 3 weeks to promote elimination of toxins through the liver, intestines, kidneys and skin. Detox side effects However, a detoxification diet can create a number of symptoms as your body goes through the process of purifying itself and eliminating toxins. Symptoms may include: - fatigue - headaches - lack of concentration - irritability - constipation - diarrhea - frequent urination - mucus or other discharge - a coated tongue - skin rash It is important that you continue with the detox and not take any conventional drugs for these symptoms. After the elimination process is done successfully, most people experience an increased feeling of general well-being and they gradually return to a normal diet. Homeopathic drainage therapy and detox Homeopathic drainage therapy is one of the best ways to promote body`s natural process of detoxification. Clinical experience in homeopathy has shown that some homeopathic medicines are able to improve blood circulation and help the body gently release the accumulated toxins and wastes from all cells and tissues. Homeopathic drugs have a drainage action when prescribed in low potencies (3X,6X, 3C, 5C). Homeopathic drainage therapy is very useful and effective in every detox program. Complex preparations containing mixtures of such drainage medicines are available and widely used for maintaining health and well-being. The length of treatment may last from 3-10 weeks and usually depends on the person`s state of health. Homeopathic drainage therapy is natural, safe and compatible with other therapeutic modalities.
