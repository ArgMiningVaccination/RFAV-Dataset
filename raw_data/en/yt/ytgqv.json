INTRODUCTION Section 707 of Public Law 102-585, as amended by section 104 of Public Law 105-368 and section 502 of Public Law 111-163, requires that an annual report be submitted to the Senate and House Veterans' Affairs Committees on the results, status, and priorities of research activities related to the health consequences of military service in the Gulf War (GW) in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm; August 2, 1990 - July 31, 1991. The Research Subcommittee of the interagency Deployment Health Working Group (DHWG) prepared this 2011 Annual Report to Congress , which is the eighteenth report on Federal research and research activities. The DHWG tracks all federally funded research projects related to Gulf War Veterans' illnesses (GWVI). As in previous Annual Reports to Congress , the material presented is divided into six sections and three appendices . Section I is an introduction; Section II summarizes the research priorities and organization of the Federal GW research portfolio; Section III highlights and summarizes research progress published since the last Annual Report to Congress ; Section IV summarizes Federal funding trends for GW research during the ten-year period from FY 2002 through FY 2011; Section V highlights new research projects and initiatives since the last report; Section VI contains literature references; and the Appendices contain listings of federally-funded research projects . II. RESEARCH PRIORITIES The research priorities remain unchanged from last year. The 19 Research Topics (2 of the original 21 topics were eliminated in the 2006 Annual Report to Congress ) are grouped into five major Research Focus Areas. These Research Focus Areas are used to organize Sections III and V, as well as Appendix B (Project Listing by Research Focus Area). In November 2005, at the request of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA), the VA Office of Research and Development (ORD) developed a set of criteria for inclusion of VA-funded projects in the GW research portfolio and then evaluated the entire VA research portfolio for projects meeting those criteria. The criteria used as the basis for the review are presented in Section II. III. PUBLISHED RESULTS AND STATUS OF THE FIELD IN 2011 Section III provides brief summaries of research articles on the health problems of GW Veterans published during calendar year 2011 or in 2010 after the previous Annual Report to Congress was submitted. Research results are grouped according to the five Research Focus Areas used to organize the 19 Research Topics (see Section II): Brain and Nervous System Function, Environmental Toxicology, Immune Function, Reproductive Health, and Symptoms and General Health Status. In this section, published research results are described followed by specific study abstracts taken from PubMed. IV. RESEARCH FUNDING TRENDS VA, Department of Defense (DoD), and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funded 400 distinct projects from FY 1992 through FY 2011 related to health problems affecting GW Veterans. The scope of the Federal research portfolio is broad, from small pilot studies to large-scale epidemiology studies involving large populations and major center-based research programs. Federal funding for research on GWVI totaled approximately $ 230 million for the period from FY 2002 through FY 2011. As of September 30, 2011 , 339 projects ( 85 percent of the 400 projects) were completed, and 61 projects (15 percent) were new or ongoing. V. NEW RESEARCH PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES Thirteen new projects were funded through the FY 2010 appropriation for the Gulf War Illness Research Program (GWIRP) managed by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Program (CDMRP) at DoD, but did not start until FY 2011. These projects focused on Brain and Nervous System Function (3), Environmental Toxicology (1), and Symptoms and General Health (9). VA funded six new projects in FY 2011. Four of these projects focused on Brain and Nervous System Function, one focused on Environ mental Toxicology, and four focused on Symptoms and General Health. *T otals for FY '02 -'11 do not include FY 1992 - 2001 Status: C=Complete; O=Ongoing APPENDIX C 1 I. INTRODUCTION The Secretary of VA is required by section 707 of Public Law 102-585, as amended by section 104 of Public Law 105- 368 and section 502 of Public Law 111-163, to submit an annual report on the results, status, and priorities of research activities related to the health consequences of military service in the Gulf War to the Senate and House Committees on Veterans' Affairs. The Research Subcommittee of the interagency Deployment Health Working Group (DHWG) prepared this 2011 Annual Report to Congress , which is the 18th report on research and all federally funded research projects related to GWVI. As in previous Annual Reports to Congress , the material presented is divided into six sections and three appendices . Section I is an introduction. Section II summarizes the research priorities and organization of the Federal GW research portfolio. Section III highlights and summarizes published research progress since the last report. Section IV summarizes Federal funding trends for GW research during the ten-year period from FY 2002 through FY 2011 . Section V highlights new research projects and initiatives since the last Annual Report to Congress . Section VI contains literature references, and the Appendices contain listings of federally-funded research projects. II. RESEARCH PRIORITIES A. Nineteen Research Topics The Persian Gulf Veterans Coordinating Board (PGVCB) was created in 1994 to coordinate research from VA, DoD , and HHS on GWVI. In 1995, the PGVCB devised a contextual framework for the results of completed and ongoing studies and also to develop an approach for the interpretation of research results. To that end, the PGVCB identified 19 major research questions and subsequently added two additional questions in 1996 (PGVCB, 1996a), to bring the total to 21. The comprehensive GW research portfolio has addressed each of these 21 questions, and relevant results have been published on each one. The Military and Veterans Health Coordinating Board (MVHCB), the successor organization to the PGVCB, conducted a comprehensive assessment of the progress made on each of these 21 questions in the 2000 Annual Report to Congress . The Research Subcommittee of the DHWG, which was established to address a broader range of deployment health issues, reviewed the 21 questions and replaced them with a corresponding list of 21 Research Topics for the 2004Annual Report to Congress (DHWG, 2006a ). The original list of 21 questions has been reduced to 19. Based on the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (IOM) review of the scientific literature on infectious diseases (Institute of Medicine, 2006b) and the state of our current scientific knowledge, the conclusion was reached in the 2006 Annual Report to Congress (DHWG, 2007) that there is no rationale to continue inclusion of infectious diseases as an area of research that will provide answers to the causes or cure for these symptoms. Questions 2 and 19 have, therefore, been removed from the original list of 21 Questions and the third Research Focus Area has been refocused from Immune Function and Infectious Diseases to just Immune Function. Projects origina lly identified as \"GW research\" under these two questions will continue to be listed in Appendices A and B, but no funding amounts will be shown for FY 2007 or beyond. Similarly, projects related to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that were originally included in the Federal GW research portfolio were closed as of FY2007 (i.e., no funds listed in Appendix C) if they did not directly study a population of ill GW Veterans or were not investigating treatments that may prove beneficial for ill GW Veterans. The IOM report reviewing the available literature on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Veterans (Institute of Medicine, 2006a) concluded there is limited and suggestive evidence of an association between military service and later development of ALS. This strengthens the decision to include ALS as a relevant topic in the Federal portfolio of GW research (DHWG, 2006b). ALS projects included in the GW portfolio are primarily focused on epidemiologic studies in GW Veterans and the development of new methodologies to identify and treat ALS. The organization of the remaining 19 Research Topics into five major categories is described in Section B below. 2 B. Research Portfolio Descriptors VA maintains a research database of federally sponsored research on GWVI. This includes research conducted by Federal scientists, as well as that by non-Federal scientists supported by Federal research funds through grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements. It is not possible to accurately track research efforts that fall within the private sector or otherwise outside of the purview of the Federal government. Nonetheless, the Research Subcommittee of the DHWG attempts to stay abreast of all research relevant to GWVI. This is accomplished by monitoring peer-reviewed published scientific literature, attending scientific meetings, and even using newspaper reports and personal accounts of researchers. Appendix A lists the projects that VA, DoD, and HHS have funded to date. Research projects are grouped according to the department that is responsible for funding. Dual-funded projects are listed under both departments. Appendix B lists all federally funded GW research projects, regardless of the agency providing the funding. Three descriptors are used to categorize each funded project. The first descriptor is the primary Research Focus Area of the project. The five Research Focus Areas are also used to organize the 19 Research Topics (see Section A, above). Brain and Nervous System Function (e.g., studies on neurological or psychological deficits and/or alterations) Organic neuropsychological and neurological deficits (original Question 16) Psychological symptoms and/or diagnoses (original Question 18) Environmental Toxicology (e.g., studies focused on specific environmental exposures such as pesticides, oil well fires, jet fuel, vaccines, medical prophylactic agents, etc.) Petroleum products and combustion products (original Question 3) Occupational/environmental hazards (original Question 4) Organophosphorus nerve agent and/or sulfur mustard from bombing at Muhammadiyat or weapons bunker at Khamisiyah (original Question 5) Chemical agents, other than at Khamisiyah (original Question 6) Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and other medical prophylaxes (e.g., vaccines and anti-malarials) (original Question 7) Psychophysiological stressors (original Question 8) Short term, low level exposures to pyridostigmine bromide, N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), or permethrin, alone or in combination as a cause of short-term and/or long-term neurological effects (original Question 17) Immune Function (e.g., studies on alterations in immune function or host defenses) Altered immune function or host defense (original Question 10) Reproductive Health (e.g., studies on sexual and/or reproductive dysfunction) Birth defects in offspring (original Question 11) Lower reproductive success (original Question 12) Sexual dysfunction (original Question 13) Symptoms and General Health (e.g., studies on mortality, pulmonary disease, cancer, chronic multisymptom illnesses, etc.) Increased prevalence or severity of symptoms and/or illnesses (original Question 1) Nonspecific symptoms and symptom complexes (e.g., chronic multisymptom illnesses) (original Question 9) Changes in lung function or airway reactivity (original Question 14) Smaller baseline lung function or greater degree of nonspecific airway reactivity (original Question 15) Development of cancers of any type (original Question 20) Mortality rates (original Question 21) 3 Seco ndar y and/or tertiary Resea rch Focus Areas from the above list may also be assigned. Two additional Research Focus Areas may be used for secondary and tertiary assignments. This permits accounting for projects that cover multiple focus areas. Chemical weapons (e.g., sarin, sulfur mustard, etc.) Pyridostigmine bromide and other medical prophylaxes (e.g., vaccines, pyridostigmine bromide, antimalarials, etc) T he sec o nd descriptor is the Project Focus , categorized as follows: Diagnosis: studies that will improve the ability to diagnose previously unexplained conditions, or to better refine diagnoses with new tools Exposure: studies that examine individual exposures and/or interactions of exposures (chemical, biological, pharmacological, physiological, etc.) Interactions: interactions of combined exposures (chemical, biological, pharmacological, physiological, etc.) Prevention: studies that will produce knowledge that could lead to disease prevention strategies Symptoms: prevalence and risk factors for symptoms and alterations in general health status Treatment: development or testing of new therapies E ach pr o ject is assigned up to three Project Focus areas as categorical descriptors. This allows accounting for projects that cover multiple focus areas. For example, a project on the neurophysiological effects of exposure to sarin in animals would have a focus on the brain and nervous system, and a focus on chemical weapons. The number of focus areas (between one and three) assigned to a project depends on the project itself. The third descriptor for each project is Research Type . Each research project on GWVI uses a method of approach to test a specific research hypothesis. Although precise categorization of research types can be difficult because of overlapping methodologies, research projects can be divided into the following general types: MECHANISTIC: Re search into underlying mechanisms of diseases and illnesses using in vitro and in vivo models. CLINICAL: A pplication of an intervention, such as in a controlled drug trial, or use of methodologies such as case- control studies to define risk factors for disease. EPIDEMIOLOGY: St udy of the distribution and determinants of disease in human populations. It includes population- based studies focused on outcomes such as mortality, symptoms, hospitalizations, etc., using devices such as postal surveys, telephone interviews, and reviews of medical records. DEVELOPMENT: I n addition to tracking research on GWVI, the DHWG also tracks development activities. In general, development is the systematic use of the knowledge or understanding gained from research directed toward the production of materials; devices; systems; or methods, including design, development, and improvement of prototypes and new processes. Within the context of GWVI, the DHWG categorizes activities as development as an activity that satisfies the general definition of development described above, and is directed toward new biologically based prevention, intervention, and treatment measures. The research database on GWVI catalogs only research and development activities that either directly involve GW Veterans or answer specific questions about risk factors. An example of the latter is a research project using animal models to determine health effects of low-level chemical warfare agents. The database does not account for the vast accumulated knowledge derived fro m the Nation's investment in more generalized biomedical research over the past 50 years. C. Portfolio Criteria In November 2005, at the request of the Secretary of VA, the VA Office of Research and Development (ORD) developed a set of criteria for inclusion of VA-funded projects in the GW research portfolio. The criteria and relevant references from that analysis are presented below. These criteria are now routinely used to identify relevant research projects. New projects selected for funding must meet these criteria and are presented in Section V. 4 1.

PUBLISHED RESULTS AND STATUS OF THE FIELD IN 2011 Since the last Annual Report to Congress, numerous research studies have provided new and detailed information on the health problems of GW Veterans. A PubMed search retrieved 59 relevant articles published in English in calendar year 2011 or in 2010 after the last report was submitted. These articles include federally and non-federally funded research, as well as international research. This section provides brief highlights of the published research divided into the five Research Focus Areas described in Section II. B., above, followed by the PubMed abstracts. A. Brain and Nervous System Function Studies relevant to Veterans of the1990-1991 Gulf War are presented in this section if they are related to brain and nervous system function. In 2011, most of these studies focused on psychological health and neuroinflammation, with a smaller number of studies investigating the long-term effects of nerve gas/organophosphate exposure primarily on the cholinergic system, learning and memory deficits, PTSD, and general long-term health of GW Veterans. There is growing evidence that chronic inflammation from exposure to chemicals or to injury can lead to progressive secondary damage. A recent report indicated that nerve gas exposure results in the chronic reduction in size in certain brain structures related to executive function and memory using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) methods (Chao et al., 2011). A study using MRI-based arterial spin labeling (ASL) and phase-contrast techniques confirmed and extended previous findings that patients with GWVI have an abnormal response to an inhibitory cholinergic challenge (physostigmine infusion) compared to age-gender-education matched control Veterans (Liu et al., 2011; Li et al., 2011b). Mice exposed to pyridostigmine bromide and permethrin displayed increased anxiety, psychomotor problems, and cognitive impairment. Proteomic analysis revealed changes in proteins related to the endocrine and immune systems and to lipid metabolism and molecular transport in the brain (Abdulla et al., 2011). Sta and colleagues examined the extent of the immune activation in ALS by measuring the expression and cellular distribution of components of innate and adaptive immunity in spinal cord and motor cortex from patients with rapid and slow sporadic ALS and controls. Their findings demonstrated a persistent and prominent activation of both innate and adaptive immunity in ALS (Sta et al., 2011). The most common psychological health issue to arise from the Gulf War was post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A magnetic resonance imaging study of 244 Gulf War Veterans indicated that the hippocampal volume in the brain is smaller in Veterans with active PTSD symptoms. Volumes are not smaller in Veterans who previously suffered with PTSD or depression (Apfel et al., 2011). In an attempt to repeat earlier magnetic resonance studies of Gulf War Veterans with and without GWVI, Weiner and coworkers measured N-acetylaspartate (NAA, a neuronal marker) in the basal ganglia and pons. No differences in NAA concentrations were found in the two groups of Veterans, but the group with GWVI had a higher frequency of PTSD (Weiner et al., 2011). In a group of 1381 Australian Gulf War Veterans, those suffering with PTSD were found to be over seven times more likely to have high blood pressure than those without PTSD (Abouzeid et al., 2012). A comparison of combat Veterans who served in Vietnam and the 1990-1991 Gulf War demonstrated that the advers e effects of combat on mental health were larger for Veterans of the Gulf War versus Vietnam (Gade and Wenger, 2011). In a study of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in Gulf War and Vietnam Veterans, it was found that 6 adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was elevated in the PTSD-positive Veterans of the Gulf War only. These data suggest that dysregulation of the HPA axis in Gulf War Veterans requires additional study (Golier et al., 2012). A study of Vietnam and Gulf War Veterans indicates that the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene which influences dopamine inactivation is involved with the effects of PTSD on the frontal lobe of the brain in both Veteran groups (Schulz-Heik et al., 2011). Sexual harassment of deployed women was found not to affect general health after returning, but sexual assault was linked to post-traumatic stress symptomatology (PSS) and gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and neurological problems (Smith et al., 2011). A review of survey instruments designed to evaluate combat stress indicated that very few of the available surveys can be reliably applied to women Veterans (Sternke, 2011). B. Environmental Toxicology Environmental agents potentially toxic to GW Veterans in theater were the topics of numerous scientific reports in 2010. These agents can be grouped into three areas: (1) depleted uranium, which is used in armor-piercing munitions; (2) chemical and anti-nerve agents (e.g., mustard gas and pyridostigmine bromide); and (3) insecticides (e.g., permethrin, chlorpyrifos). Depleted Uranium (DU) In a longitudinal study of 35 Veterans exposed to DU, urine uranium levels were elevated in patients with embedded fragments, but there were no apparent cellular toxicity or changes in renal function, although there was a decrease in serum parathyroid hormone and increases in urine calcium and sodium excretion in the group with higher urine uranium levels (McDiarmid, Engelhardt, et al., 2011). Bakhmutsky and coworkers studied the genotoxic effects (measured as number of micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes) of DU in GW Veterans enrolled in a long-term health surveillance program at the Baltimore VAMC. Urinary uranium (uU) levels were used to separate Veterans into low and high exposure groups. There was no measureable difference in genotoxic effect between the two groups (Bakhmutsky et al., 2011) . In a follow-up study, four were measured, but there were no differences between the high- and low-uranium groups. This reinforces the notion that there can only be a weak link between DU exposure and genotoxicity, although there might be a threshold effect for HPRT MFs (McDiarmid, Albertini, et al., 2011). The p53 tumor suppressor protein is activated by certain toxic metals, but a series of cytotoxicity tests indicate that there is no p53 response to uranyl acetate and uranyl nitrate (Heintze et al., 2011). Skin patches containing uranyl acetate were used to check skin reactivity to the metal, but there was no reaction. The authors concluded that dermatitis observed in some veterans was not likely due to DU exposure (Shvartsbeyn et al., 2011). Since s ome metals are linked to Alzheimer's disease, there was interest in determining if DU could have a similar effect. Acetylcholine and cholesterol metabolisms in the cerebral cortex were tested on a transgenic mouse model, but there was no evidence that exposure to DU had a significant effect on amyloid precursor protein (Lestaevel et al., 2011). The effects of DU on the activity of 1-hydroxylase in the kidney was tested by implanting DU fragments in rats. The activity decreased after three months but was back to normal after six and twelve months of exposure. However, it was concluded that kidney damage occurred and that the synthesis of vitamin D was inhibited (Yan et al., 2011). Pourahmad and coworkers demonstrated that a \u00df- (13) -D-glucan can serve as an antioxidant and radical scavenger to prevent lysis of rat hepatocytes due to reactive oxygen species after exposure to DU. They suggest this material as prophylaxis or treatment for DU exposure (Pourahmad et al., 2011). Th e ability of chitooligosaccharides to selectively chelate uranium in DU-exposed human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells has also been demonstrated (Zhang et al., 2011). Environmental samples from southern Iraq were tested for a number of materials including uranium. Water from the Euphrates River and soils from the surrounding area had concentrations of uranium and U-235/U-238 ratios in expected ranges (Riccobono et al., 2011). In another study near Fallujah, Iraq, hair samples from the parents of children with congenital anomalies along with soil and water samples were tested for uranium and other metals. Even though lead, mercury, uranium, vanadium, and other toxic metals were found, the authors concluded that their findings suggested that uranium exposure was the cause of certain health problems in the area (Alaani et al., 2011). 7 Nerve and Chemical Agents So man (pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate), a warfare nerve agent, almost completely (>95%) inhibits acetylcholinesterase activity in human intercostals muscle fibers. If the muscle fibers are pretreated with pyridostigmine bromide, only 80% inhibition was observed (Maselli et al., 2011). I nsecticides and Pesticides I ndividual pesticides and combinations of pesticides and other chemical species have been considered to be important in many of the medical problems exhibited by Gulf War Veterans. After exposing mice to low levels of chlorpyrifos, and organophosphate pesticide, for five days, it was found that hippocampal synaptic transmission in the brain decreased by 50% after three months, thus demonstrating that there was long-term brain damage even though there were no short- term problems (Speed et al., 2012). The effects of organophosphates on dopamine and glutamatergic neurotransmission in the brain were studied by exposing mice to chlorpyrifos pesticide, diisopropyl fluorophosphates (a nerve agent simulant), agent protectant), and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET, an insect repellent). In all cases where an organophosphate was used, there were changes in brain function that would be associated with neurological disorders (Torres et al., 2011). Chlorpyrifos and its metabolite Chlorpyrifos-oxon were tested in rat cortical neurons to see if they have an effect on mitochondria. It was concluded that organophosphates act by altering mitochondrial dynamics and transport in axons (Middlemore et al., 2011). In a study utilizing bovine red blood cell acetylcholinesterase, it was found that pyridostigmine bromide provides protection against pesticides like chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon-oxon, and paraoxon, but does not protect against malaoxon (Henderson et al., 2011). Wille and coworkers investigated the interactions among low levels of DEET, PB, and pesticides with human cholinesterases in vitro, and determined that these compounds do not have a synergistic effect on cholinesterase activity (Wille et al., 2011a; 2001b). Other researchers disagree with this conclusion (Moss, 2011). O il Well Spills W hile the Kuwaiti oil well fires were burning in 1991, a model was developed to estimate environmental exposures to US troops. The model was based on combustion products from crude oil, wind patterns, and air dispersion calculations. The resulting health risk assessment was able to determine the relative risk of the oil fires and other possible environmental exposures (Heller, 2011). During the same period, a US Army unit was being monitored for adverse health effects. Blood and urine were collected for laboratory analyses, questionnaires were administered, and other activities were conducted before deployment, during deployment, and after deployment. The challenges associated with obtaining useful medical surveillance information during deployment was discussed (Deeter, 2011). The health effects of oil spills were studied after millions of gallons of crude oil escaped into the Gulf of Mexico. Acute and chronic conditions affecting people in the region were described (Levy and Nassetta, 2011). C. Immune Dysfunction and Infectious Diseases Broderick and colleagues examined the patterns of immune markers and their evolution during exercise in ill GW Veterans. Cortisol was measured in saliva and other body fluids before and after an exercise test, and immune cell populations were surface-stained for a panel of nine immune cell markers. The results suggested that there may be an autoimmune component in the etiology of GWVI (Broderick et al., 2011). Immunoexcitotoxicity is a term used to explain pathological and neurodevelopmental changes in autism and GWVI. It is described as an interaction between immune receptors in the central nervous system and excitatory glutamate receptors, and it was suggested to be involved in a number of neurodegenerative conditions (Blaylock and Maroon, 2011). Shoenfeld and Agmon-Levin reviewed the current data on the role of adjuvants in the pathogenesis of immune- mediated diseases with special interest in siliconosis, GWVI, macrophagic myofasciitis syndrome and post-vaccination phenomena . They suggested that these four conditions be grouped together and referred to as \"autoimmune (or autoinflammatory) syndrome induced by adjuvants\" (ASIA) (Shoenfeld and Agmon -Levin, 2011; Perricone et al., 2011). D. Reproductive Health As indicated above, hair samples from the parents of children with congenital anomalies were tested for metals. Even though lead, mercury, uranium, vanadium, and other toxic metals were found, the authors concluded that their findings suggested that uranium exposure might be the cause of the congenital problems (Alaani et al., 2011). 8 General Health E. Symptoms and General Health The UK Defence Analytical Services and Advice, in the Ministry of Defence, published summary statistics on the causes of deaths that occurred among the UK Veterans of the 1990- 1991 Gulf War . The mortality rates of 53,409 U.K. GW Veterans were analyzed along with those of a comparison group, consisting of 53,143 U.K. Armed Forces personnel of similar age, gender, Service, regular/reservist status and rank who were in Service on 1 January 1991 but did not deploy to the Persian Gulf (Defence Analytical Services and Advice, 2011). A symposium and workshop was held to review environmental exposures and health risks to military personnel. Exposures during the Gulf War were discussed at length, and suggestions were made for improving the US military strategy for dealing with these issues in the future (DeFraites and Richards, 2011). A description of the unique environments and exposures in battlefield situations from World War II to the 1990-1991 Gulf War were presented along with strategies for dealing with these problems after the conflicts (Richards, 2011). Changes in environmental health surveillance initiated by the DoD after the Gulf War were described and discussed (Batts and Parzik, 2011; Kirkpatrick, 2011; Martin et al., 2011) as were recommendations from the Institute of Medicine (Joellenbeck, 2011). Alcohol use and drinking patterns were the focus of a study that found a correlation between problem drinking and PTSD, major depressive disorder, unexplained multisymptom illness, and chronic fatigue syndrome-like illness (Coughlin et al., 2011a). Similarly, a study of overweight and obese Gulf War Veterans found that obesity was correlated with PTSD and other chronic conditions not associated exclusively with the Gulf War (Coughlin et al., 2011b). In a 10-year follow-up study of the health of Gulf War Veterans, it was found that deployed Veterans were more likely to have persistent poor health and more likely to experience new adverse health conditions than their Gulf-era counterparts (Li et al., 2011a). A comparison of the health status of US and UK Gulf War Veterans showed similar scores on standard surveys, but the variations between the two groups may be due to cultural differences in the way health results are reported (Ismail et al., 2011). Environmental epidemiological studies, including illnesses among Gulf War Veterans, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were recently summarized (Falk and Briss, 2011). GWVI, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, and Fibromyalgia Amin and coworkers found that Veterans with GWV I had a significantly increased frequency of arousals related to apneas, hypopneas, and mild inspiratory airflow limitation, suggesting the possibility that treating these sleep disorders might significantly improve their quality of life (Amin et al., 2011a). In a subsequent small pilot study (n=17) they found that Veterans receiving continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatments experienced improvements in pain (34 percent), fatigue (38 percent), cognitive function (33 percent), sleep quality (41 percent), physical health (34 percent) and mental health (16 percent); larger clinical trials will be required to replicate these findings and establish th e utility of this intervention (Amin et al., 2011b). A previously-developed case definition for GWVI based on factor analysis was validated by applying it to a new cohort of 8,020 Gulf War Veterans (Iannacchione et al., 2011). In a comment about the article by Iannacchione and coworkers, it was pointed out that case definitions are essential even in a situation like the one facing Gulf War Veterans where it is difficult to connect symptoms to specific exposures (Sharma, 2011). The prevalence of ch ronic multisymptom illness in deployed Gulf War Veterans appears to be related to a Veteran's location in the Kuwait theater of operations. For Veterans who were in Iraq and Kuwait multisymptom illness was most strongly correlated with the use of PB tablets or being within one mile of an exploding SCUD missile. For personnel in support areas, the most significant correlation was with pesticides (Steele et al., 2012). In a small study of Gulf War Veterans with GWVI, a treatment based on hormone replacement was conducted. All five patients who qualified for the trial reported improvements in symptoms, but additional research with a larger cohort is required to determine if such a treatment is widely applicable (Wakil et al., 2011). A clinical trial using Rituximab (an anti-CD20 antibody) or placebo to treat patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) resulted in improvement in 67% of the Rituximab patients and only 13% in the placebo group after the 12-month follow-up. The delayed response to Rituximab has prompted the authors to suggest that CFS is an autoimmune disease 9 (Fluge et al., 2011). Since headaches are more frequent in CFS patients, a study was designed to characterize the types and severities of headaches. Migraine headaches were found in 84% of CFS patients (5% of healthy controls), and tension headaches in 81% of CFS patients (45% in controls). Of the CFS patients with migraine headaches, 24% had migraines with aura while 60% had migraines without aura. The patients without aura, however, also had lower pain thresholds and higher rates of fibromyalgia (Ravindran et al., 2011). F. Abstracts from Published Research Abdullah L, Crynen G, Reed J, Bishop A, Phillips J, Ferguson S, Mouzon B, Mullan M, Mathura V, Mullan M, Ait-Ghezala G, Crawford F (2011) Proteomic CNS profile of delayed cognitive impairment in mice exposed to Gulf War agents. Neuromolecular Med 13:275-288. (Epub 2011 Oct 11.) Abstract: Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic multisymptom condition with a central nervous system (CNS) component, for which there is no treatment available. It is now believed that the combined exposure to Gulf War (GW) agents, including pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and pesticides, such as permethrin (PER), was a key contributor to the etiology of GWI. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to characterize the biomolecular disturbances that accompany neurobehavioral and neuropathological changes associated with combined exposure to PB and PER. Mice acutely exposed to PB and PER over 10 days showed an increase in anxiety-like behavior, psychomotor problems and delayed cognitive impairment compared to control mice that received vehicle only. Proteomic analysis showed changes in proteins associated with lipid metabolism and molecular transport in the brains of GW agent-exposed mice compared to controls. Proteins associated with the endocrine and immune systems were also altered, and dysfunction of these systems is a prominent feature of GWI. The presence of astrogliosis in the GW agent-exposed mice compared to control mice further suggests an immune system imbalance, as is observed in GWI. These studies provide a broad perspective of the molecular disturbances driving the late pathology of this complex illness. Evaluation of the potential role of these biological functions in GWI will be useful in identifying molecular pathways that can be targeted for the development of novel therapeutics against GWI. Abouzeid M, Kelsall HL, Forbes AB, Sim MR, Creamer MC (2012) Posttraumatic stress disorder and hypertension in Australian veterans of the 1991 Gulf War. J Psychosom Res 72:33-38. (Epub 2011 Sep 21.) Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Military v eterans experience a high prevalence of psychopathologies such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Relationships between physical and psychological health are increasingly recognised. This study investigated associations between PTSD and hypertension in male Australian Gulf War veterans. METHODS: In 2000 -02, 1456 veterans underwent medical and psychological assessments. Medical practitioners rated self-reported medical conditions as probable diagnoses, possible, unlikely or non-medical. The Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) assessed psychological symptomatology present in the 12 months preceding evaluation, and lifetime prevalence. Odds of hypertension among those with and without PTSD were calculated for each timeframe using logistic regression. RESULTS: Analysis was restricted to the 1381 veterans for whom CIDI and medical data were available. Hypertension was considered probable in 100 subjects (7.2%). Adjusted odds ratios of hypertension were 2.90 (95% CI 1.19-7.09) amongst veterans with PTSD in the past 12 months and 2.27 (95% CI 1.01-5.10) for lifetime prevalence, compared with those without PTSD. Hypertension was over seven times more likely amongst veterans with PTSD alone than those with no mental illness in the past 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Veterans with a history of PTSD had increased odds of having hypertension. Given the array of disabling psychosocial associations of PTSD, and the numerous potential clinical sequelae of hypertension, co-existence of these conditions may have implications for prevention and management at the individual, clinical, and public health policy and practice level. Early identification of PTSD in military samples may help to ameliorate longer-term adverse physical health outcomes. Alaa ni S, Tafash M, Busby C, Hamdan M, Blaurock-Busch E (2011) Uranium and other contaminants in hair from the parents of children with congenital anomalies in Fallujah, Iraq. Confl Health 5:15. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent reports have drawn attention to increases in congenital birth anomalies and cancer in Fallujah Iraq blamed on teratogenic, genetic and genomic stress thought to result from depleted Uranium contamination following the battles in the town in 2004. Contamination of the parents of the children and of the environment by Uranium and other elements was investigated using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Hair samples from 25 fathers and mothers of children diagnosed with congenital anomalies were analysed for Uranium and 51 other elements. Mean ages of the parents was: fathers 29.6 (SD 6.2); mothers: 27.3 (SD 6.8). For a sub-group of 6 women, long locks of hair were analysed for Uranium along the length of the hair to obtain information about historic exposures. Samples of soil and water were also analysed and Uranium isotope ratios determined. RESULTS: Levels of Ca, Mg, Co, Fe, Mn, V, Zn, Sr, Al, Ba, Bi, Ga, Pb, Hg, Pd and U (for mothers only) were significantly higher tha n 10 published mean levels in an uncontaminated population in Sweden. In high excess were Ca, Mg, Sr, Al, Bi and Hg. Of these only Hg can be considered as a possible cause of congenital anomaly. Mean levels for Uranium were 0.16 ppm (SD: 0.11) range 0.02 to 0.4, higher in mothers (0.18 ppm SD 0.09) than fathers (0.11 ppm; SD 0.13). The highly unusual non-normal Fallujah distribution mean was significantly higher than literature results for a control population Southern Israel (0.062 ppm) and a non-parametric test (Mann Whitney-Wilcoxon) gave p = 0.016 for this comparison of the distribution. Mean levels in Fallujah were also much higher than the mean of measurements reported from Japan, Brazil, Sweden and Slovenia (0.04 ppm SD 0.02). Soil samples show low concentrations with a mean of 0.76 ppm (SD 0.42) and range 0.1- 1.5 ppm; (N = 18). However it may be consistent with levels in drinking water (2.28 gL-1) which had similar levels to water from wells (2.72 gL-1) and the river Euphrates (2.24 gL-1). In a separate study of a sub group of mothers with long hair to investigate historic Uranium excretion the results suggested that levels were much higher in the past. Uranium traces detected in the soil samples and the hair showed slightly enriched isotopic signature s for hair U238/U235 = (135.16 SD 1.45) compared with the natural ratio of 137.88. Soil sample Uranium isotope ratios were determined after extraction and concentration of the Uranium by ion exchange. Results showed statistically significant presence of enriched Uranium with a mean of 129 with SD5.9 (for this determination, the natural Uranium 95% CI was 132.1 < Ratio < 144.1). CONCLUSIONS: Whilst caution must be exercised about ruling out other possibilities, because none of the elements found in excess are reported to cause congenital diseases and cancer except Uranium, these findings suggest the enriched Uranium exposure is either a primary cause or related to the cause of the congenital anomaly and cancer increases. Questions are thus raised about the characteristics and composition of weapons now being deployed in modern battlefields. Amin MM, Belisova Z, Hossain S, Gold MS, Broderick JE, Gold AR (2011a) Inspiratory airflow dynamics during sleep in veterans with Gulf War illness: a controlled study. Sleep Breath 15:333- 339. Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine whether veterans with Gulf War Illness (GWI) are distinguished by sleep- disordered breathing, we compared inspiratory airflow dynamics during sleep between veterans with GWI and asymptomatic veterans of the first Gulf War. METHODS: We recruited 18 male veterans with GWI and 11 asymptomatic male veterans of the first Gulf War by advertisement. The two samples were matched for age and body mass index. Each participant underwent a first full-night polysomnogram (PSG) while sleeping supine using standard clinical monitoring of sleep and breathing. A second PSG was performed measuring airflow with a pneumotachograph in series with a nasal mask and respiratory effort with a supraglottic pressure (Psg) catheter to assess the presence of inspiratory airflow limitation during supine N2 sleep. We determined the prevalence of flow-limited breaths by sampling continuous N2 sleep and plotting inspiratory flow against Psg for each breath in the sample. We expressed the prevalence of flow-limited breaths as their percentage in the sample. RESULTS: Compared to controls, veterans with GWI had an increased frequency of arousals related to apneas, hypopneas, and mild inspiratory airflow limitation. with GWI had 96 \u00b1 5% (mean \u00b1 SD) of their breaths flow-limited while controls had 36 \u00b1 25% of their breaths flow limited (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Veterans with GWI experience sleep-disordered breathing that may distinguish them from asymptomatic veterans of the first Gulf War. Amin MM, Gold MS, Broderick JE, Gold AR (2011b) The effect of nasal continuous positive airway pressure on the symptoms of Gulf War illness. Sleep Breath 15:579- 587. Abstract: PURPOSE: We performed a pilot study to determine whether nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) alleviates the symptoms of veterans with Gulf War illness (GWI) and sleep disordered breathing (SDB). METHODS: Eighteen male veterans with GWI and SDB recruited by advertisement, participated in a randomized, single-masked, sham-controlled treatment trial. Participants received 3 weeks of treatment during sleep with either therapeutic nasal CPAP or sham nasal CPAP. Using validated questionnaires, pain, fatigue, cognitive function, sleep disturbance, and general health were assessed by self-report before and after treatment. One of the participants assigned to therapeutic CPAP was excluded from the trial before starting treatment, leaving 17 participants. RESULTS: Compared to the nine sham nasal CPAP recipients, the eight participants receiving therapeutic nasal CPAP experienced improvements in pain (34%; p = 0.0008), fatigue (38%; p = 0.0002), cognitive function (33%; p = 0.004), sleep quality (41%; p = 0.0003), physical health (34%; p = 0.0003), and mental health (16%; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings in this pilot study suggest that nasal CPAP may greatly improve symptoms in veterans with GWI and SDB. Apfel BA, Ross J, Hlavin N, Neylan TC (2011) Hippocampal Volume Differences in Gulf War Veterans with Current Versus Lifetime Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms. Biol Psychiatry 69:541- 548. 11 Abstract: BACKGROUND: Decreased hippocampal volume is described in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. However, it is not known whether it is a risk factor for the development of PTSD or a consequence of PTSD. We sought to determine the effects of PTSD and depressive symptoms on hippocampal volume. METHODS: Clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data were collected in a cross sectional study of 244 Gulf War veterans. Measures included lifetime and current Clinician Administered PTSD Scale, Hamilton Depression Scale, Life Stressor Checklist, and Lifetime Drinking History. Magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired with a 1.5-T scanner and analyzed with automated and semiautomated image processing techniques. RESULTS: Eighty-two veterans had lifetime PTSD, 44 had current PTSD, and 38 had current depression. In the linear regression analysis, current PTSD symptoms (standardized coefficient = -.25, p = .03) but neither lifetime PTSD symptoms nor current depression were associated with smaller hippocampal volume. Gender, age, history of early life trauma, education, lifetime and current alcohol use, current marijuana use, and treatment with antidepressants did not have independent effects. Participants with chronic PTSD had, on average, a smaller hippocampus compared with those with remitted PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that current but not lifetime PTSD symptom severity explains hippocampal size raises two possibilities: either a small hippocampus is a risk factor for lack of recovery from PTSD (trait) or PTSD effects on hippocampal volume are reversible once PTSD symptoms remit and the patient recovers (state). Bakhmutsky MV, Oliver MS, McDiarmid MA, Squibb KS, Tucker JD (2011) Long term depleted uranium exposure in Gulf War I veterans does not cause elevated numbers of micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Mutat Res 720:53-57. Abstract: Depleted uranium (DU) is a high density heavy metal that has been used in military munitions since the 1991 Gulf War. DU is weakly radioactive and chemically toxic. Long term exposure can cause adverse health effects. This study assessed genotoxic effects in DU exposed Gulf War I veterans as a function of uranium (U) body burden. Levels of urine U were used to categorize the cohort into low and high exposure groups. Exposure to DU occurred during friendly fire incidents in 1991 involving DU munitions resulting in inhalation and ingestion exposure to small particles of DU and soft tissue DU fragments from traumatic injuries. All of these Veterans are enrolled in a long term health surveillance program at the Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center. Blood was drawn from 35 exposed male veterans aged 36-59 years, then cultured and evaluated for micronuclei (MN) using the cytokinesis block method. The participants were divided into two exposure groups, low and high, based on their mean urine uranium (uU) concentrations. Poisson regression analyses with mean urine U concentrations, current smoking, X-rays in the past year and donor age as dependent variables revealed no significant relationships with MN frequencies. Our results indicate that on-going systemic exposure to DU occurring in Gulf War I Veterans with DU embedded fragments does not induce significant increases in MN in peripheral blood lymphocytes compared to MN frequencies in Veterans with normal U body burdens. Batts R, Parzik D (2011) Panel 3: Conducting environmental surveillance sampling to identify exposures. Mil Med 176(7 Suppl):101- 104. Abstract: Environmental sampling technology has improved significantly since Operations Desert Shield and Storm (Gulf War I, August 6, 1990-February 27, 1991). Deployment of U.S. Forces overseas and Joint Service operations have increased, and large numbers of troops are currently deployed for long periods of time. Concerns of adverse health effects from environmental exposures, similar to the concerns about exposures to oil well fires in Gulf War I, continue to occur today. Although progress has been made in developing Joint Service policies for training and conducting environmental sampling, the military doctrine that drives this training and allows for the purchase of updated sampling equipment has been slow to respond to changes, thus resulting in conflicts between current technology and assets available in the field. The military needs to remain flexible to new technology and new requirements, and must standardize doctrine and training across the services, and acquire standardized, state- of-the-art sampling equipment to improve field assets. Blaylock RL, Maroon J (2011) Immunoexcitotoxicity as a central mechanism in chronic traumatic encephalopathy-A unifying hypothesis. Surg Neurol Int 2:107. (Epub 2011 Jul 30.) Abstract: Some individuals suffering from mild traumatic brain injuries, especially repetitive mild concussions, are thought to develop a slowly progressive encephalopathy characterized by a number of the neuropathological elements shared with various neurodegenerative diseases. A central pathological mechanism explaining the development of progressive neurodegeneration in this subset of individuals has not been elucidated. Yet, a large number of studies indicate that a process called immunoexcitotoxicity may be playing a central role in many neurodegenerative diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The term immunoexcitotoxicity was first coined by the lead author to explain the evolving pathological and neurodevelopmental changes in autism and the Gulf War Syndrome, but it can 12 be applied to a number of neurodegenerative disorders. The interaction between immune receptors within the central nervous system (CNS) and excitatory glutamate receptors trigger a series of events, such as extensive reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species generation, accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, and prostaglandin activation, which then leads to dendritic retraction, synaptic injury, damage to microtubules, and mitochondrial suppression. In this paper, we discuss the mechanism of immunoexcitotoxicity and its link to each of the pathophysiological and neurochemical events previously described with CTE, with special emphasis on the observed accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau. Broderick G, Kreitz A, Fuite J, Fletcher MA, Vernon SD, Klimas N (2011) A pilot study of immune network remodeling under challenge in Gulf War Illness. Brain Behav Immun 25:302-313. Abstract: Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a complex disorder affecting nervous, endocrine and immune regulation. Accordingly, we propose that GWI presents with a distinct pattern of immune signaling. To explore this we compared interaction patterns linking immune markers and their evolution during exercise. Blood was collected from 9 GWI and 11 control subjects prior to a Graded eXercise Test (GXT) (t ), at peak effort (t ) and 4 h post-exercise (t ). Salivary cortisol and plasma, serum or culture supernatants were analyzed for concentrations of CD26 information (MI) networks linking these immune markers were generated in each group at each time point. Graph theory was used to describe the evolution of each network's structure and identify potential nucleating points. Distinct in topology, GWI networks had more abundant connections but were less organized. NPY, IL- 1, TNF- and CD2+/CD26+ nodes were better integrated in the GWI network at rest. Under effort (t ) these differences were replaced by significant restructuring around nodes for CD19+ B cell population, IL-5, IL-6 and soluble CD26 concentrations. This pattern subsided post-exercise. Further analysis indicated that IL- 1 and CD2+/CD26+ nodes strongly influen ced this characteristic modulation of B and T cell network motifs. This potentially heightened lymphocyte and HPA axis responsiveness to IL-1 stimulation in the context of a mixed Th1:Th2 immune signature supports an autoimmune component in GWI etiology. Chao LL, Abadjian L, Hlavin J, Meyerhoff MW (2011) Effects of low-level sarin and cyclosarin exposure and Gulf War Illness on brain structure and function: a study at 4T. Neurotoxicology 32:814-822. (Epub 2011 Jun 29.) Abstract: BACKGROUND: More than 100,000 US troops were potentially exposed to chemical warfare agents sarin (GB) and cyclosarin (GF) when an ammunition dump at Khamisiyah, Iraq was destroyed during the 1991 Persian Gulf War (GW). We previously found reduced total gray matter (GM) volume in 40 GW veterans with suspected GB/GF exposure relative to 40 matched, unexposed GW veterans on a 1.5T MR scanner. In this study, we reexamine the relationship between GB/GF exposure and volumetric measurements of gross neuroanatomical structures in a different cohort of GW veterans on a 4T MR scanner. METHODS: Neuropsychological and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a cross sectional study on Gulf War Illness performed between 2005 and 2010 were used in this study. 4T MRI data were analyzed using automated image processing techniques that produced volumetric measurements of gray matter (GM), white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). RESULTS: Binary comparisons of 64 GB/GF exposed veterans and 64 'matched', unexposed veterans revealed reduced GM (p=0.03) and WM (p=0.03) volumes in the exposed veterans. Behaviorally, exposed veterans committed more errors of omission (p=0.02) and tended to hav e slower responses (p=0.05) than unexposed veterans on the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), a measure sustained and selective attention. Regression analyses confirmed that GB/GF exposure status predicted GM (=-0.11, p=0.02) and errors (=0.22, p=0.02) over and above potentially confounding demographic, clinical, and psychosocial variables. There was no dose-response relationship between estimated levels of GB/GF exposure and brain volume. However, we did find an effect of Gulf War Illness/Chronic Multisymptom Illness on both GM and WM volume in the GB/GF exposed veterans. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm previous reports by our group and others of central nervous system pathology in GW veterans with suspected exposure to low levels of GB/GF two decades after the exposure. Coughlin SS, Kang HK, Mahan CM (2011a) Alcohol use and selected health conditions of 1991 gulf war veterans: survey results, 2003-2005. Prev Chronic Dis 8:A52. (Epub 2011 Feb 15.) Abstract: INTRODUCTION: A sizable literature has analyzed the frequency of alcohol consumption and patterns of drinking among veterans. However, few studies have examined patterns of alcohol use in veterans of the first Gulf War or factors associated with problem drinking in this population. We examined the frequency and patterns of alcohol use in male and female veterans who served in the 1991 Gulf War or during the same era and the relationships between alcohol use and selected health conditions. METHODS: We analyzed data from a follow-up survey of health 13 information among population-based samples of 15,000 Gulf War and 15,000 Gulf Era veterans. Data had been collected from 9,970 respondents during 2003 through 2005 via a structured questionnaire or telephone survey. RESULTS: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), unexplained multisymptom illness (MSI), and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)-like illness were more frequent among veterans with problem drinking than those without problem drinking. Approximately 28% of Gulf War veterans with problem drinking had PTSD compared with 13% of Gulf War veterans without problem drinking. In multivariate analysis, problem drinking was positively associated with PTSD, MDD, unexplained MSI, and CFS-like illness after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, branch of service, rank, and Gulf status. Veterans who were problem drinkers were 2.7 times as likely to have PTSD as veterans who were not problem drinkers. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that access to evidence-based treatment programs and systems of care should be provided for veterans who abuse alcohol and who have PTSD and other war-related health conditions and illnesses. Coughlin SS, Kang HK, Mahan CM (2011b) Selected Health Conditions Among Overweight, Obese, and Non- Obese Veterans of the 1991 Gulf War: Results from a Survey Conducted in 2003-2005. Open Epidemiol J 4:140-146. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Several health co nditions and concerns have been reported to be increased among Gulf War veterans including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), CFS-like illness, and unexplained multi-symptom illness (MSI). As the cohort of Gulf War veterans advance in age, they are likely to be at risk of not only certain deployment-related health conditions but also chronic diseases associated with lifestyle factors. METHODS: To clarify relationships between PTSD, CFS-like illness, MSI, and obesity, we analyzed data from a cross- sectional survey of health information among population-based samples of 15,000 Gulf War veterans and 15,000 veterans who served during the same era. Data had been collected from 9,970 respondents in 2003-2005 via a structured questionnaire or telephone survey. RESULTS: Based upon body mass index (BMI) estimated from self-reported information about height and weight, the percentages of Gulf War and Gulf Era veterans who were overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9), were 46.8% and 48.7%, respectively. The percentages who were obese (BMI 30) were 29.6% and 28.3%, respectively. Without adjustment for Gulf deployment status (Gulf War vs Gulf Era), age, sex, or other factors, PTSD, MSI, CFS-like illness, and other chronic health conditions were more common among obese veterans than those who were normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9). In multivariate analyses, PTSD was positively associated with obesity after adjustment for age, sex, Gulf deployment status, rank, income, education, and current smoking. In the model for PTSD, the adjusted odds ratio for obesity was 1.5 (95% CI 1.2-1.8). No associations were observed between BMI categories and CFS-like illness or MSI in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Gulf War and Gulf Era veterans who were obese were more likely to have certain chronic health conditions including PTSD. Associations between Gulf status and CFS-like illness and MSI identified in the 2003-2005 follow-up survey were not accounted for by group differences in the prevalence of overweight or obesity. Deet er DP (2011) The Kuwait Oil Fire Health Risk Assessment Biological Surveillance Initiative. Mil Med 176(7 Suppl):52- 55. Abstract: An important environmental concern during the first Gulf War (Operation Desert Storm) was assessing exposures and potential health effects in U.S. forces exposed to the Kuwait oil fires. With only 3 weeks for planning, a Biological Surveillance Initiative (BSI) was developed and implemented for a U.S. Army unit. The BSI included blood and urine collections, questionnaire administration, and other elements during the predeployment, deployment, and post-deployment phases. Many BSI objectives were accomplished. Difficulties encountered included planning failures, loss of data and information, and difficulty in interpreting laboratory results. In order for biological surveillance initiatives to provide useful information for future deployments where environmental exposures may be a concern, meaningful, detailed, and realistic planning and preparation must occur long before the deployment is initiated.

Mil Med 176(7 Suppl):17-21. Abstract: From May 19 to May 21, 2010, the Armed Forced Health Surveillance Center and the Uniformed Services University cosponsored an educational symposium and workshop on the assessment of potentially hazardous environmental exposures among military populations. Symposium participants reviewed and analyzed historical exposure events, from herbicides in Vietnam to the 1991 Gulf War oil well fires and World Trade Center dust exposure in 2001, using the framework that the Institute of Medicine developed for addressing environmental exposures and their possible impact on military populations. Historical exposures were critically assessed in terms of methods used to identify and define harmful exposures, to prevent or limit exposures, and to define the health risks to exposed people. The lessons learned were then used during small group discussions to deliberate on the current scientific approach for dealing with hazardous environmental exposures. This article summarizes the major conclusions and proceedings of the symposium and provides suggestions to improve the U.S. military's current strategy on identifying and assessing potentially hazardous environmental exposures. Falk H, Briss P (2011) Environmental- and injury-related 79. Abstract: This paper summarizes environmental investigations (n = 458) conducted during the first 60 years of the epidemic-assistance investigation program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These investigations were grouped into 10 categories: toxic chemicals (n = 102), indoor air quality and outdoor air toxics (n = 21), new or rare epidemic diseases and unexplained syndromes (n = 29), natural disasters (n = 81), terrorism and unintentional human-made disasters (n = 9), substance use and abuse (n = 13), environmental aspects of infectious disease (n = 132), those affecting neonates and infants (n = 11), violence and injuries (n = 51), and miscellaneous (n = 9). Among the most important or prominent were studies of lead and arsenic toxicity at smelters, mercury in paint and beauty creams, dioxin in waste oil in Missouri, polychlorinated biphenyls and multiple other toxic chemicals, global pesticide poisoning outbreaks, hepatic angiosarcoma among vinyl chloride workers, toxic oil syndrome in Spain, eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome from contaminated L-tryptophan, diethylene glycol poisoning in Haiti, aflatoxicosis in Kenya, Gulf War illness among veterans, impact and needs assessments during natural disasters (e.g., Hurricane Katrina (2005) and the Mount St. Helens volcano eruptions (1980)), risk factors for heat-related mortality, domestic and international terrorist attacks, Parkinsonism related to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in California, H, O, Nyland H, Mella O (2011) Benefit from B-lymphocyte depletion using the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab in chronic fatigue syndrome. A double-blind and placebo-controlled study. PLoS One 6:e26358. (Epub 2011 Oct 19.) Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disease of unknown aetiology. Major CFS symptom relief during cancer chemotherapy in a patient with synchronous CFS and lymphoma spurred a pilot study of B-lymphocyte depletion using the anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab, which demonstrated significant clinical response in three CFS patients. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II study (NCT00848692), 30 CFS patients were randomised to either Rituximab 500 mg/m(2) or saline, given twice two weeks apart, with follow-up for 12 months. Xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) was not detected in any of the patients. The responses generally affected all CFS symptoms. Major or moderate overall response, defined as lasting improvements in self-reported Fatigue score during follow-up, was seen in 10 out of 15 patients (67%) in the Rituximab group and in two out of 15 patients (13%) in the Placebo group (p=0.003). Mean response duration within the follow-up period for the 10 responders to Rituximab was 25 weeks (range 8- 44). Four Rituximab patients had clinical response durations past the study period. General linear models for repeated measures of Fatigue scores during follow-up showed a significant interaction between time and intervention group (p=0.018 for self-reported, and p=0.024 for physician-assessed), with differences between the Rituximab and Placebo groups between 6-10 months after intervention. The primary end-point, defined as effect on self-reported Fatigue score 3 months after intervention, was negative. There were no serious adverse events. Two patients in the Rituximab group with pre-existing psoriasis experienced moderate psoriasis worsening. CONCLUSION: The delayed responses starting from 2-7 months after Rituximab treatment, in spite of rapid B-cell depletion, suggests that CFS is an autoimmune disease and may be consistent with the gradual elimination of autoantibodies preceding clinical responses. The present findings will impact future research efforts in CFS. Gade DM, Wenger JB (2011) Combat exposure and mental health: the long-term effects among US Vietnam and Gulf war veterans. Health Econ 20:401-416. 15 Abstract: Using a random sample of more than 4000 veterans, we test the effects of combat exposure on mental health. We focus on two cohorts of veterans: those who served in Vietnam (1964-1975) and the Gulf War (1990-1991). Combat exposure differed between these groups in intensity, duration and elapsed time since exposure. We find that combat exposure generally, and exposure to dead, dying, or wounded people, specifically, is a significant predictor of mental health declines as measured by an individual's Mental Component Summary score. Under our general specifications, the negative effects of combat on mental health were larger for Gulf war veterans than for Vietnam veterans as of 2001. These effects persist after controlling for demographic characteristics, insurance coverage, income and assets. Using discrete factor, nonparametric maximum likelihood (DFML) estimation we controlled for unobserved heterogeneity as well as the factors above. In the DFML specifications we find a negative impact of exposure to dead, wounded or dying people for both Gulf and Vietnam veterans, but find no statistically significant effect for combat exposure overall for Vietnam veterans as of 2001. Based on our Gulf war parameters, we estimate that the costs of mental health declines to be between $87 and $318 per year for each soldier with combat service and exposure to dead, dying and wounded people. Golier JA, Caramanica K, Yehuda R (2012) Neuroendocrine response to CRF stimulation in veterans with and without PTSD in consideration of war zone era. Psychoneuroendocrinology 37:350-357. (Epub 2011 Aug 2). Abstract: BACKGROUND: Alterations in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity have been observed in Gulf War veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) which differ from those observed in other veteran groups, raising the possibility that there is a unique neuroendocrine profile in this group of veterans. This study seeks to further characterize the effects of PTSD, military cohort (Vietnam, 1991 Gulf War, Operations Enduring Freedom/Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF)), and their interaction on the neuroendocrine response to synthetic corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) stimulation. METHODS: 51 male veterans were studied consisting of 21 from the Vietnam era, 16 from the Gulf War era, and 14 from the OEF/OIF era. 16 of these veterans were deployed to a war zone and had chronic PTSD (PTSD+), 25 were deployed to a war zone and did not have chronic PTSD (PTSD-), and 10 were not deployed to a war zone and did not have PTSD (non-exposed). The participants underwent the CRF stimulation test in the afternoon (approximately 2:00 p.m.), which measures the integrity and sensitivity of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were measured at baseline and at intervals over a 2h period following intravenous administration of 1 g/kg of ovine CRF (o-CRF , max 100 g). In small su bset of participants, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and cortisol binding globulin (CBG) were also assessed. RESULTS: There was a significant group by era interaction in the response of ACTH to CRF, in addition to a main effect of group (PTSD+, PTSD-, non-exposed). The interaction reflected that group differences were only evident in the Gulf War cohort; among Gulf War era veterans, the PTSD+ group had higher elevations in ACTH levels following CRF than the PTSD- group and the non-exposed group. Additionally, the peak change in ACTH was associated with a self-reported environmental exposure (pyridostigmine bromide ingestion) which has been found to be linked to the excess morbidity found in Gulf War veterans. Self-reported childhood trauma was greater in veterans of the Gulf War than Vietnam or OEF/OIF, but did not account for the observed differences. There was a significant effect of group on the cortisol response to CRF, reflecting greater responsivity in both of the deployed groups (PTSD+ and PTSD-) compared to the non-exposed group which could be accounted for by baseline differences in cortisol levels; unlike the ACTH response, the cortisol response did not differ by era. There were no effects of group, era, or their interaction on the DHEA and CBG response to CRF. CONCLUSIONS: A uniform pattern of PTSD-related alterations in the response to intravenous CRF was not found. Rather, PTSD-related alterations were found only in veterans of the 1991 Gulf War, and were characterized by an enhanced pituitary response to CRF which may reflect increased sensitivity of pituitary corticotrophs or CRF hyposecretion. Together with previous neuroendocrine findings, the data suggest the HPA axis is dysregulated in Gulf War veterans in unique ways which may reflect the long-term effects of environmental exposures in addition to disease effects. Further work is needed to characterize these effects and their impact on long-term psychological and medical outcomes. Heintze E, Aguilera C, Davis M, Fricker A, Li Q, Martinez J, Gage MJ (2011) Toxicity of depleted uranium complexes is independent of p53 activity. J Inorg Biochem 105:142-148. (Epub 2010 Oct 29.) Abstract: The p53 tumor suppressor protein is one of the key checkpoints in cellular response to a variety of stress mechanisms, including exposure to various toxic metal complexes. Previous studies have demonstrated that arsenic and chromium complexes are able to activate p53, but there is a dearth of data investigating whether uranium complexes exhibit similar effects. The use of depleted uranium (DU) has increased in recent years, raising concern about DU's potential carcinogenic effects. Previous studies have shown that uranyl acetate and uranyl nitrate are capable of inducing DNA strand breaks and potentially of inducing oxidative stress through free radical generation, two potential mechanisms for activation of p53. Based on these studies, we hypothesized that either uranyl acetate or uranyl nitrate 16 could act as an activator of p53. We tested this hypothesis using a combination of cytotoxicity assays, p53 activity assays, western blotting and flow cytometry. All of our results demonstrate that there is not a p53-mediated response to either uranyl acetate or uranyl nitrate, demonstrating that any cellular response to uranium exposure likely occurs in a p53-independent fashion under the conditions studied. Heller JM (2011) Oil well fires of Operation Desert Storm --defining troop exposures and determining health risks. Mil Med 176(7 Suppl):46- 51. Abstract: During Operation Desert Storm, in February 1991, Iraqi troops began burning Kuwaiti oil wells. Almost immediately there was concern about possible adverse health effects in U.S. personnel exposed to crude oil combustion products. Combustions products were predicted from the known composition of Kuwaiti crude oil. Monitoring sites were established in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait; about 5,000 environmental samples were studied. Data collected were used to develop health risk assessments for the geographic areas sampled. This initial approach to assessing risk had to be greatly expanded when Congress passed Public Law 102-190, requiring development of means to calculate environmental exposures for individual U.S. service members. To estimate daily exposure levels for the entire area over 10 months for all U.S. troops, air dispersion modeling was used in conjunction with satellite imagery and geographic information system technology. This methodology made it possible to separate the risk caused by oil fire smoke from the total risk from all sources for each service member. The U.S. military responses to health concerns related to the oil well fires and to Public Law 102-190 were reviewed. Consideration was given to changes in technology, practices, and policies over the last two decades that might impact a similar contemporary response. Henderson JD, Glucksman G, Leong B, Tigyi A, Ankirskaia A, Siddique I, Lam H, DePeters BW (2012) Pyridostigmine 3.) Abstract: Pyridostigmine bromide (PB) has been used to protect soldiers from the toxic effects of soman, a chemical warfare agent. Recent research shows that pyridostigmine bromide protects a significant percentage of acetylcholinesterase in isolated human intercostal muscle. Findings presented here indicate that red blood cell acetylcholinesterase is similarly protected by pyridostigmine bromide from the action of diisopropyl fluorophosphat e and several organophosphate pesticides including chlorpyrifos-oxon, diazinon-oxon, and paraoxon, but not malaoxon, using the bovine red blood cell as a subject. These findings suggest that pretreatment with PB may protect growers, farmworkers, first responders, and the public, in general, from the effects of selected pesticides. Iannacchione VG, Dever JA, Bann CM, Best H, Haley RW (2011) Validation of a research case definition of Gulf War illness in the 1991 US military population. Neuroepidemiology 37:129-140. (Epub 2011 Oct 7.) Abstract: BACKGROUND: A ca se definition of Gulf War illness with 3 primary variants, previously developed by factor analysis of symptoms in a US Navy construction battalion and validated in clinic veterans, identified ill veterans with objective abnormalities of brain function. This study tests prestated hypotheses of its external validity. METHODS: A stratified probability sample (n = 8,020), selected from a sampling frame of the 3.5 million Gulf War era US military veterans, completed a computer-assisted telephone interview survey. Application of the prior factor weights to the subjects' responses generated the case definition. RESULTS: The structural equation model of the case definition fit both random halves of the population sample well (root mean-square error of approximation = 0.015). The overall case definition was 3.87 times (95% confidence interval, 2.61-5.74) more prevalent in the deployed than the deployable nondeployed veterans: 3.33 (1.10-10.10) for syndrome variant 1; 5.11 (2.43-10.75) for variant 2, and 4.25 (2.33-7.74) for variant 3. Functional status on SF-12 was greatly reduced (effect sizes, 1.0-2.0) in veterans meeting the overall and variant case definitions. CONCLUSIONS: The factor case definition applies to the full Gulf War veteran population and has good characteristics for research.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: UK and US military personnel appear to have different health profiles yet direct comparisons of health status and deployment exposures between US and UK military populations have never been performed. AIMS: To compare US and UK military personnel deployed to the 1991 Persian Gulf War (PGW) for rates of symptom reporting, medical conditions and health status [Short Form-36 general health perception (GHP) and physical functioning (PF) and self-report military exposures. METHODS: We analysed representative cross- sectional samples of military personnel from the Iowa Persian Gulf Study (n = 3626) and the UK Health Survey of Military Personnel (n = 5573) that included directly comparable measures and stratified by those who had been 17 deployed to PGW and those who had not been deployed to PGW. RESULTS: Although UK veterans had similar mean PF scores as US veterans (mean differences in PGW: 0.86, 95% CI -0.36 to 2.07 95% CI - 1.84 to 0.62), they had mean GHP scores (mean differences in PGW: -5.62, 95% CI -5.40 to -2.27). UK PGW veterans were more likely to report Gulf specific exposures, and this was associated with worse GHP (UK mean difference -9.05, 95% CI -11.49 to -6.61 95% CI -6.62 to -1.98). CONCLUSIONS: This study observed transatlantic variations in health status in military populations that may reflect cultural differences in the reporting of health. Joellenbeck LM (2011) Medical surveillance and other strategies to protect the health of deployed U.S. forces: revisiting after 10 years. Mil Med. 176(7 Suppl):64-70. Abstract: Following the first Gulf War (Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 1990-1991), medically unexplained symptoms and illnesses reported by many returning veterans proved frustrating to veterans, care providers, and military planners. The Department of Defense (DoD) sought an independent, proactive effort to learn from the lessons of the Gulf War and other deployments and the development of a strategy to better protect the health of the troops. DoD engaged the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council to provide input in four areas: assessment of health risks during deployments; technologies and methods for detection and tracking of exposures; physical protection and decontamination; and medical protection, health consequences and treatment, and medical record keeping. In a third year, a committee emphasized and extended the recommendations from the four interim reports to describe a long-term strategy for health protection. This article notes salient recommendations from the report on medical protection and record keeping and from the final report that still bear emphasis a decade after the reports were published. Kirkpatrick JS (2011) The impact of U.S. military operations in Kuwait, Bosnia, and Kosovo (1991-2000) on environmental health surveillance. Mil Med 176(7 Suppl):41- 45. Abstract: Deployments of U.S. Forces to the Persian Gulf (1991), Bosnia and Herzegovina (1995), and Kosovo (1999) were associated with diverse, potential environmental exposures. Health effects possibly associated with these exposures were cause for concern among service members, veterans, and military and civilian leaders. A need for the military to effectively respond to these exposures, and more importantly, to assess and mitigate exposures before deployments and to conduct environmental surveillance during deployments was identified. The Department of Defense encountered many obstacles in dealing with the exposures of 1991. Even though these obstacles were being identified, and in some cases, addressed, responses to historical exposure concerns continued to be reactive. In 1996, efforts were intensified to improve policy and doctrine, field sampling equipment, risk assessment processes, geographic information systems, and other tools needed to effectively identify and reduce the impact of exposures before troops deploy and to conduct environmental surveillance while deployed. Success in these efforts resulted in a comprehensive, planned approach being implemented to address environmental health concerns during the 1999 Kosovo deployment.

C R Biol 334:85- 90. (Epub 2011 Jan 26.) Abstract: Some heavy metals, or aluminium, could participate in the development of Alzheimer disease (AD). Depleted uranium (DU), another heavy metal, modulates the cholinergic system and the cholesterol metabolism in the brain of rats, but without neurological disorders. The aim of this study was to determine what happens in organisms exposed to DU that will/are developing the AD. This study was thus performed on a transgenic mouse model for human amyloid precursor protein (APP), the Tg2576 strain. The possible effects of DU through drinking water (20 mg/L) over an 8- month period were analyzed on acetylcholine and cholesterol metabolisms at gene level in the cerebral cortex. The mRNA of transporter (VAChT) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABC A1) decreased in control Tg2576 mice in comparison with wild-type mice (respectively - 89%, -86% and -44%, p < 0.05). Chronic exposure of Tg2576 mice to DU increased mRNA levels of ChAT (+189%, p < 0.05), VAChT (+120%, p < 0.05) and ABC A1 (+52%, p < 0.05) compared to control Tg2576 mice. Overall, these modifications of acetylcholine and cholesterol metabolisms did not lead to increased disturbances that are specific of AD, suggesting that chronic DU exposure did not worsen the pathology in this experimental model. Lev y BS, Nassetta WJ (2011) The adverse health effects of oil spills: a review of the literature and a framework for medically evaluating exposed individuals. Int J Occup Environ Health 17:161-167. Abstract: In April 2010, an explosion on an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11 workers, injured 17 workers, and spilled an estimated 185 million gallons of crude oil into the Gulf. Adverse effects on the health of cleanup workers, 18 fishermen, and others as well as on the ecosystem are being studied. This paper reviews published studies of the adverse health effects due to previous oil spills. Acute effects have included: respiratory, eye, and skin symptoms; headache; nausea; dizziness; and tiredness or fatigue . Chronic effects have included: psychological disorders, respiratory disorders, genotoxic effects, and endocrine abnormalities. We also present a systematic approach to evaluating individuals exposed to oil spills. Li B, Mahan CM, Kang HK, Eisen SA, Engel CC (2011a) Longitudinal Health Study of US 1991 Gulf War Veterans: Changes in Health Status at 10-Year Follow-up. Am J Epidemiol 174:761-768. (Epub 2011 Jul 27.) Abstract: The authors assessed changes in the health status of US 1991 Gulf War-era veterans from a 1995 baseline survey to a 2005 follow-up survey, using repeated measurement data from 5,469 deployed Gulf War veterans and 3,353 nondeployed Gulf War-era veterans who participated in both surveys. Prevalence differences in health status between the 2 surveys were estimated for adverse health indices and chronic diseases for each veteran group. Persistence risk ratios and incidence risk ratios were calculated after adjustment for demographic and military service characteristics through Mantel-Haenszel stratified analysis. At 10-year follow-up, deployed veterans were more likely to report persistent poor health, as measured by the health indices (functional impairment, limitation of activities, repeated clinic visits, recurrent hospitalizations, perception of health as fair or poor, chronic fatigue syndrome-like illness, and posttraumatic stress disorder), than nondeployed veterans. Additionally, deployed veterans were more likely to experience new onset of adverse health (as measured by the indices) and certain chronic diseases than were nondeployed veterans. During the 10-year period from 1995 to 2005, the health of deployed veterans worsened in comparison with nondeployed veterans because of a higher rate of new onset of various health outcomes and greater persistence of previously reported adverse health on the indices. Li X, Spence JS, Buhner DM, Hart J Jr, Cullum CM, MR Imaging and 261:218-225. Sep 13.) determine, with arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and physostigmine challenge, if abnormal hippocampal blood flow in ill Gulf War veterans persists 11 years after initia l testing with single photon emission computed tomography and nearly 20 years after the 1991 Gulf War. Materials and Methods: The local institutional review board approved this HIPAA-compliant study. Veterans were screened for contraindications and gave written informed consent before the study. In a semiblinded retrospective protocol, veterans in three Gulf War illness groups-syndrome 1 (impaired cognition), syndrome 2 (confusion-ataxia), and syndrome 3 (central neuropathic pain)-and a control group received intravenous infusions of saline in an initial session and physostigmine in a second session, 48 hours later. Each infusion was followed by measurement of hippocampal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with pulsed ASL. A mixed-effects linear model adjusted for age was used to test for differences in rCBF after the cholinergic challenge across the four groups. Results: Physostigmine significantly decreased hippocampal rCBF in control subjects (P < .0005) and veterans with syndrome 1 (P < .05) but significantly increased hippocampal rCBF in veterans with syndrome 2 (P < .005) and veterans with syndrome 3 (P < .002). The abnormal increase in rCBF was found to have progressed to the left hippocampus of the veterans with syndrome 2 and to both hippocampi of the veterans with syndrome 3. Conclusion: Chronic hippocampal perfusion dysfunction persists or worsens in veterans with certain Gulf War syndromes. ASL MR imaging examination of hippocampal rCBF in a cholinergic challenge experiment may be useful as a diagnostic test for this condition. Liu P, Aslan S, Li X, Buhner DM, Spence JS, Briggs RW, Haley RW, Lu H (2011) Perfusion deficit to cholinergic challenge in veterans with Gulf War Illness. Neurotoxicology 32:242-246. Abstract: A highly plausible etiology for Gulf War Illness (GWI) is that the neural damage and cognitive deficits are associated with excessive exposure to cholinesterase-inhibiting cholinergic stimulants. Our previous SPECT study provided strong indication that cerebral blood flow (CBF) in veterans with GWI may be different from those of unaffected control veterans. The present study confirmed and extended previous findings that patients with GWI have abnormal response to an inhibitory cholinergic challenge, physostigmine infusion, when compared to age-gender- education matched control veterans. The MRI-based arterial spin labeling (ASL) and phase-contrast techniques have several key advantages over SPECT, including shorter experiment duration, complete non-invasiveness, and higher spatial and temporal resolutions, and therefore may provide a cost-effective biomarker for characterization of GWI. Martin NJ, Richards EE, Kirkpatrick JS (2011) Exposure science in U.S. military operations: a review. Mil Med 176(7 Suppl):77-83. 19 Abstract: Since 1991, the U.S. Department of Defense has conducted deployment occupational and environmental health surveillance activities in the geographic combatant commands for major conflicts, military exercises, and humanitarian and peace-building missions. The DoD has made significant improvements in documenting and assessing deployment environmental hazards and threats since 1991, illustrated by accomplishments in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Operations Noble Eagle (following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks); Enduring Freedom-Afghanistan; and Iraqi Freedom (2003-2010). Sampling is now recommended as part of the DoD Exposure Assessment Method, a dynamic process that is performed during all phases of military operations: I --Predeployment, II --Mobilization, III --Conflict, and IV-Postdeployment. From 2001 to 2009, deployed personnel collected over 24,500 air, water, soil, and bulk samples during operations. These efforts have lead to the creation of an environmental health surveillance database that has been used to investigate public health issues. However, gaps exist, especially in the assessment of individual exposures during deployment. Maselli RA, Henderson JD, Ng J, Follette D, Graves G, Wilson BW (2011) Protection of human muscle acetylcholinesterase from soman bromide (PB) exposed to the irreversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor soman was investigated. METHODS: Muscles with 3 \u00d7 10(-6) M PB or saline for 20 minutes, then exposed to 10(-7) M soman for 10 minutes. RESULTS: AChE of muscles treated with soman alone was inhibited >95%. In contrast, PB pretreatment of soman-exposed bundles protected 20% of AChE activity. AChE of bundles exposed to PB alone recovered after 4 hours, but bundles exposed to both PB and soman did not. Soman-induced reduction of resting membrane potentials and increment of amplitudes and decay times of miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs) were partially corrected by PB pretreatment. CONCLUSIONS: In vitro pretreatment of human muscles with PB protected up to 20% of muscle AChE and ameliorated some deleterious effects on endplate physiology induced by soman. McDiarmid MA, Albertini RJ, Tucker JD, Vacek PM, Bakhmutsky MV, Oliver MS, Engelhardt SM, Squibb KS (2011) Measures of genotoxicity in Gulf war I veterans exposed to depleted uranium. Environ Mol Mutagen 52:569-581. (Epub 2011 Jul 4). Abstract: Exposure to depleted uranium (DU), an alpha-emitting heavy metal, has prompted the inclusion of markers of genotoxicity in the long-term medical surveillance of a cohort of DU-exposed Gulf War veterans followed since 1994. Using urine U (uU) concentration as the measure of U body burden, the cohort has been stratified into low- u (<0.10 g U/g creatinine) and high- u groups ( 0.10 g U/g creatinine). Surveillance outcomes for this cohort have historically included markers of mutagenicity and clastogenicity, with past results showing generally nonsignificant differences between low- vs. high-U groups. However, mean hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) mutant frequencies (MFs) have been almost 50% higher in the high-U group. We report here results of a more comprehensive protocol performed in a 2009 evaluation of a subgroup (N = 35) of this cohort. Four biomarkers of genotoxicity [micronuclei (MN), chromosome aberrations, and MFs of HPRT and PIGA] were examined. There were no statistically significant differences in any outcome measure when results were compared between the low- vs. high-U groups. However, modeling of the HPRT MF results suggests a possible threshold effect for MFs occurring in the highest U exposed cohort members. Mutational spectral analysis of HPRT mutations is underway to clarify a potential clonal vs. a threshold uU effect to explain this observation. This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of a human population chronically exposed to DU and demonstrates a relatively weak genotoxic effect of the DU exposure. These results may explain the lack of clear epidemiologic evidence for U carcinogenicity in humans.

J Toxicol Environ Health A 74:678-691. Abstract: As part of a longitudinal surveillance program, 35 members of a larger dynamic cohort of 79 Gulf War I veterans exposed to depleted uranium (DU) during combat underwent clinical evaluation at the Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center. Health outcomes and biomonitoring results were obtained to assess effects of DU exposure and determine the need for additional medical intervention. Clinical evaluation included medical and exposure histories, physical examination, and laboratory studies including biomarkers of uranium (U) exposure. Urine collections were obtained for U analysis and to measure renal function parameters. Other laboratory measures included basic hematology and chemistry parameters, blood and plasma U concentrations, and markers of bone metabolism. Urine U (uU) excretion remained above normal in participants with embedded DU fragments, with urine U concentrations ranging from 0.006 to 1.88 g U/g creatinine. Biomarkers of renal effects showed no apparent evidence of renal 20 functional changes or cellular toxicity related to U body burden. No marked differences in markers of bone formation or bone resorption were observed; however, a statistically significant decrease in levels of serum intact parathyroid hormone and significant increases in urinary calcium and sodium excretion were seen in the high versus the low uU groups. Eighteen years after first exposure, members of this cohort with DU fragments continue to excrete elevated concentrations of uU. No significant evidence of clinically important changes was observed in kidney or bone, the two principal target organs of U. Continued surveillance is prudent, however, due to the ongoing mobilization of uranium from fragment depots. Middlemore-Risher ML, Ada m BL, Lambert NA, Terry AV Jr (2011) Effects of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos- oxon on the dynamics and movement of in cortical neurons. J Pharmacol Exp 28.) Ab stract: Organophosphate (OP)-based pesticides have been used extensively for decades, and as a result, they hav e become almost ubiquitous in our environment. There is clinical and animal evidence to suggest that chronic exposures to OPs can lead to cognitive dysfunction and other neurological abnormalities, although the mechanism for these effects is unknown. We previously reported that repeated, subthreshold exposures (defined as doses not associated with signs of acute toxicity) to the commonly used OP chlorpyrifos (CPF) resulted in protracted impairments in the performance of attention and memory-related tasks in rodents as well as deficits in axonal transport ex vivo (in the sciatic nerve). Here, we investigated the effects of CPF and its active metabolite CPF oxon (CPO) on the dynamics and movement of mitochondria in rat primary cortical neurons using time-lapse imaging techniques. Exposure to CPF (1.0- 20.0 M) or CPO (5.0 nM- 20.0 M) for 1 or 24 h resulted in a concentration -dependent increase in mitochondrial length, a decrease in mitochondrial number (indicative of increased fusion events), and a decrease in their movement in axons. The changes occurred at concentrations of CPF and CPO that did not inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity (the commonly cited mechanism of acute OP toxicity), and they were not blocked by cholinergic receptor antagonists. Furthermore, the changes did not seem to be associated with direct (OP-related) effects on mitochondrial viability or function (i.e., mitochondrial membrane potential or ATP production). The results suggest that an underlying mechanism of organophosphate-based deficits in cognitive function might involve alterations in mitochondrial dynamics and/or their transport in axons.

Abstract: Recently, Shoenfeld and Agmon-Levin described a potential new syndrome, namely ASIA - autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants, that comprises four medical conditions: siliconosis, the Gulf war syndrome, the macrophagic myofasciitis syndrome and post-vaccination phenomena, characterized by hyperactive immune responses accompanied by a similar complex of signs and symptoms. Most relevantly, these conditions share a linkage represented by adjuvants. This common soil may possibly induce autoimmune or auto- inflammatory diseases in humans as it was demonstrated in different animal models. Reconsidering under a unified umbrella this apparently detached condition is not only intriguing, but also provocative, and may help in unraveling novel pathogenetic mechanisms, preventive measures, and therapeutic targets. Pourahmad J, Shaki F, Tanbakosazan F, Ghalandari R, Ettehadi of fungal -(13) -D-glucan against oxidative stress cytotoxicity induced by Hum Exp Toxicol 30:173-181. (Epub 2010 Jun3) Abstract: certain carbohydrate polymers, such as -(13) -D-glucan, may possess free radical scavenging activity. The present study examined the free radical scavenging activity of a carbohydrate polymer, -(13) -D-glucan against oxidative stress induced by depleted uranium in isolated rat hepatocytes. Addition of U (VI) (uranyl acetate) to isolated rat hepatocytes results in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, rapid glutathione depletion, mitochondrial membrane potential collapse and lysosomal membrane rupture before hepatocyte lysis occurred. Our results showed that quite similar to silymarin, which is a known antioxidant and radical scavenger, tiny 21 concentration of -glucan (138 nM) very successfully protected the hepatocytes against cell lysis and all oxidative stress cytotoxicity endpoints caused by depleted uranium including ROS formation, glutathione depletion, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, lysosomal membrane rupture and caspase 3 activity increase. In conclusion, our results con firmed the antioxidant and radical scavenging activity of -(13) -D-glucan and suggested this compound and silymarin as possible drug candidates for prophylaxis and treatment against depleted uranium toxic effects. Ravindran MK, Zheng Y, Timbol C, Merck SJ, Baraniuk JN (2011) Migraine headaches in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS): comparison of two prospective cross-sectional studies. BMC Neurol 11:30. Abstract: BACKGROUND: Headaches are more frequent in ronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) than healthy contro l (HC) subjects. The 2004 International Headache Society (IHS) criteria were used to define CFS headache phenotypes. METHODS: Subjects in Cohort 1 (HC = 368; CFS = 203) completed questionnaires about many diverse symptoms by giving nominal (yes/no) answers. Cohort 2 (HC = 21; CFS = 67) had more focused evaluations. They scored symptom severities on 0 to 4 anchored ordinal scales, and had structured headache evaluations. All subjects had history and physical examinations; assessments for exclusion criteria; questionnaires about CFS related symptoms (0 to 4 scale), Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) and Medical Outcome Survey Short Form 36 (MOS SF-36). RESULTS: Demographics, trends for the number of diffuse \"functional\" symptoms present, and severity of CFS case designation criteria symptoms were equivalent between CFS subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2. HC had significantly fewer symptoms, lower MFI and higher SF-36 domain scores than CFS in both cohorts. Migraine headaches were found in 84%, and tension-type headaches in 81% of Cohort 2 CFS. This compared to 5% and 45%, respectively, in HC. CFS group (60%; with aura (24%; headaches or no headaches (4%). Co-morbid tension and migraine headaches were found in 67% of CFS. CFS+MA had higher severity scores than CFS+MO for the sum of scores for poor memory, dizziness, balance, and numbness (\"Neuro-construct\", p = 0.002) and perceived heart rhythm disturbances, palpitations and noncardiac chest pain (\"Cardio-construct\"; p = 0.045, t-tests (2.36 kg [1.95-2.78; 95% C.I.] n = 40) and a higher prevalence of fibromyalgia (47%; 1990 criteria) compared to HC (5.23 kg [3.95-6.52] n = 20; and 0%, respectively). Sumatriptan was beneficial for 13 out of 14 newly diagnosed CFS migraine subjects. CONCLUSIONS: CFS subjects had higher prevalences of MO and MA than HC, suggesting that mechanisms of migraine pathogenesis such as central may F , Perra G, Pisani A, Protano G (2011) Trace element distribution and 235U/238U ratios in Euphrates waters and in soils and tree barks of Dhi Qar province (southern Iraq). Sci Total Environ 409:3829- 3838. (Epub 2011 Jul 19.) Abstract: To assess the quality of the environment in southern Iraq after the Gulf War II, a geochemical survey was carried out. The survey provided data on the chemistry of Euphrates waters, as well as the trace element contents, U and Pb isotopic composition, and PAH levels in soil and tree bark samples. The trace element concentrations and the (235)U/(238)U ratio values in the Euphrates waters were within the usual natural range, except for the high contents of Sr due to a widespread presence of gypsum in soils of this area. The trace element contents in soils agreed with the common geochemistry of soils from floodplain sediments. Some exceptions were the high contents of Co, Cr and Ni, which had a natural origin related to ophiolitic outcrops in the upper sector of the Euphrates basin. The high concentrations of S and Sr were linked to the abundance of gypsum in soils. A marked geochemical homogeneity of soil samples was suggested by the similar distribution pattern of rare earth elements, while the (235)U/(238)U ratio was also fairly homogeneous and within the natural range. The chemistry of the tree bark samples closely reflected that of the soils, with some notable exceptions. Unlike the soils, some tree bark samples had anomalous values of the (235)U/(238)U ratio due to mixing of depleted uranium (DU) with the natural uranium pool. Moreover, the distribution of some trace elements (such as REEs, Th and Zr) and the isotopic composition of Pb in barks clearly differed from those of the nearby soils. The overall results suggested that significant external inputs occurred implying that once formed the DU-enriched particles could travel over long distances. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in tree bark samples showed that phenanthrene, fluoranthene and pyrene were the most abundant components, indicating an important role of automotive traffic. Richards EE (2011) Responses to occupational and environmental exposures in the U.S. military --World War II to the present. Mil Med 176(7 Suppl):22- 28. Abstract: Since the Civil War, a proportion of U.S. service members continues to return from war with new health problems and continues to reference battlefield exposures as the cause. Hence, one of the most pressing public health debates in military policy, the determination of causality and linking of battlefield exposures to health outcomes in veterans, continues. The advances in military environmental and occupational epidemiologic research and Department 22 of Defense policy concerning battlefield exposures are summarized and examples from World War II through the first Gulf War are provided. The limitations associated with the unique battlefield environment, multiple environmental exposures, and the inherent stresses of war, beget challenges for researchers responsible for determining causality. In light of these difficulties, six strategies for addressing environmental exposures and their possible impact on veterans were recommended by the Institute of Medicine post Operation Desert Storm. These strategies, along with their respective progress and remaining gaps, are addressed. Schulz-Heik RJ, Schaer M, Eliez S, 70:1091-1096. Jul 23.) Abstract: BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with structural and functional compromise of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which may in turn be associated with impairment of its ability to regulate the amygdala. The Val158Met polymorphism in the catechol-O-methyltransferase gene, which substantially influences dopamine inactivation in the frontal lobe in general and in ACC in particular, may moderate ACC integrity in PTSD. METHODS: We tested this hypothesis in a sample of Vietnam and Persian Gulf War veterans who experienced substantial military operational stress, including 51 who met criteria for PTSD and 48 matched controls who did not. RESULTS: Participants with PTSD were previously reported to have smaller ACC volumes than controls in this sample. A novel repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted with PTSD diagnosis, Val158Met genotype, and their interaction predicting left and right ACC volume. Genotype was not directly related to ACC volume, but it did significantly interact with the PTSD diagnosis. The difference in ACC volume between the participants without PTSD and participants with PTSD was greater among individuals homozygous for the Val allele than among carriers of the Met allele. This finding was driven largely by the right ACC. Analyses of Caucasian-only, non-Caucasian-only, and male-only subsamples indicated similar patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest Val158Met genotype moderates the effect of PTSD-related processes on right ACC volume. Sharma SK (2011) Importance of case definition in epidemiological studies. Neuroepidemiology 37(2):141-142. (Epub 2011 Oct 7.) (Comment on: Validation of a research case definition of Gulf War illness in the 1991 US military population. Neuroepidemiology. 2011;37:129- 140.) Summary: In the absence of a case definition, the value of [research] studies is questionable. It is important, therefore, to estimate the size of the sample that would be required to have a reasonable expectation of detecting differences between deployed and nondeployed veterans or exposures to hazardous substances. Many variables are involved in such calculations, for example, the size of the investigated exposure's expected impact on health (consistent lethal effects can be detected in a smaller sample rather than more subtle problems) and the prevalence of exposure, some of which were unknown at the time federal [research] studies were planned. Shoenfeld Y, Agmon-Levin N (2011) 'ASIA' autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced adjuvants. J Autoimmun 36:4-8. (Epub 2010 Aug 13.) Abstract: The role of various environmental factors in the pathogenesis of immune mediated diseases is well established. Of which, factors entailing an immune adjuvant activity such as infectious agents, silicone, aluminium salts and others were associated with defined and non-defined immune mediated diseases both in animal models and in humans. In recent years, four conditions: siliconosis, the Gulf war syndrome (GWS), the macrophagic myofasciitis syndrome (MMF) and post-vaccination phenomena were linked with previous exposure to an adjuvant. Furthermore, these four diseases share a similar complex of signs and symptoms which further support a common denominator. Thus, we review herein the current data regarding the role of adjuvants in the pathogenesis of immune mediated diseases as well as the amassed data regarding each of these four conditions. Relating to the current knowledge we would like to suggest to include these comparable conditions under a common syndrome entitled ASIA, \"Autoimmune (Auto- inflammatory) Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants\".

Dermatitis 22:33-39. Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Depleted Uranium Follow-Up Program is a clinical surveillance program run by the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center since 1993 for veterans of the Gulf and Iraqi wars who were exposed to depleted uranium (DU) as a result of \"friendly-fire\" incidents. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: In 2009, 40 veterans from this cohort were screened for skin reactivity to metals by patch-testing with extended metal series and uranyl 23 acetate (0.25%, 2.5%, and 25%). A control arm comprised 46 patients without any known occupational exposures to DU who were seen at the University of Maryland Dermatology Clinic for evaluation of allergic contact dermatitis. RESULTS: Excluding irritant reactions, no patch-test reactions to uranyl acetate were observed in the participants. Irritant reactions to DU were more common in the clinic cohort, likely reflective of the demographic differences between the two arms of the study. Biologic monitoring of urine uranium concentrations in the DU program participants with 24-hour urine samples showed evidence of percutaneous uranium absorption from the skin patches. CONCLUSION: We conclude that dermatitis observed in a subset of the veterans was unrelated to their military DU exposure. Our data suggest that future studies of skin testing with uranyl acetate should utilize 0.25%, the least irritating concentration. Smith BN, Shipherd JC, Schuster JL, Vogt DS, King LA, King DW (2011) Posttraumatic stress symptomatology as a mediator of the association between military sexual trauma and post-deployment physical health in women. J Trauma Dissociation 12:275-289. Abstract: This study examined posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PSS) as a mediator of the association between military sexual trauma and post-deployment physical health. Relationships were examined in a sample of 83 female veterans of the first Gulf War (1990-1991) approximately 10 years post-deployment. Participants reported on the frequency of sexual harassment and sexual assault experienced during deployment. Physical health was measured using participants' self-reports of pre-deployment and post-deployment symptoms within 7 body systems. Sexual harassment exposure was not found to be associated with PSS-mediated associations with physical health symptoms. However, sexual assault during deployment was found to be associated with PSS and 4 of the 7 health symptom clusters assessed: gastrointestinal, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and neurological symptoms. Furthermore, PSS was found to be a significant mediator of the sexual assault-physical health relationship in each of these domains, with the indirect path accounting for 74% to 100% of the relationship. The findings from the current study indicate that sexual assault has detrimental associations with physical health and that PSS plays a primary role in that relationship. Speed HE, Blaiss CA, Kim A, Haws ME, Melvin NR, Jennings M, Eisch AJ, Powell CM (2012) Delayed reduction of hippocampal synaptic transmission and spines following exposure to repeated subclinical doses of organophosphorus pesticide in adult mice. Toxicol Sci 125:196-208. (Epub 2011 Sep 26.) Abstract: Agricultural and household organophosphorus (OP) pesticides inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AchE), resulting in increased acetylcholine (Ach) in the central nervous system. In adults, acute and prolonged exposure to high doses of AchE inhibitors causes severe, clinically apparent symptoms, followed by lasting memory impairments and cognitive dysfunction. The neurotoxicity of repeated environmental exposure to lower, subclinical doses of OP pesticides in adults is not as well studied. However, repeated exposure to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as chlorpyrifos (CPF), pyridostigmine, and sarin nerve agent, has been epidemiologically linked to delayed onset symptoms in Gulf War Illness and may be relevant to environmental exposure in farm workers among others. We treated adult mice with a subclinical dose (5 mg/kg) of CPF for 5 consecutive days and investigated hippocampal synaptic transmission and spine density early (2-7 days) and late (3 months) after CPF administration. No signs of cholinergic toxicity were observed at any time during or after treatment. At 2-7 days after the last injection, we found increased synaptic transmission in the CA3-CA1 region of the hippocampus of CPF-treated mice compared with controls. In contrast, at 3 months after CPF administration, we observed a 50% reduction in synaptic transmission likely due to a corresponding 50% decrease in CA1 pyramidal neuron synaptic spine density. This study is the first to identify a biphasic progression of synaptic abnormalities following repeated OP exposure and suggests that even in the absence of acute cholinergic toxicity, repeated exposure to CPF causes delayed persistent damage to the adult brain in vivo.

Neurobiol Dis 42:211-220. Abstract: Increasing e vidence suggests a role for the immune system in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To determine the extent of the immune activation in ALS we analyzed the expression and cellular distribution of components of innate and adaptive immunity in spinal cord (SC) and motor cortex (MCx) from patients with rapid and slow sporadic ALS and controls. High levels of mRNA and protein of classical complement pathway, C1q and C4, as well as the downstream complement components C3 and C5b-9 were found in all ALS samples. Furthermore, we found + higher numbers of activated microglia, reactive astrocytes, dendritic cells (DCs) and CD8 T-cells in ALS than in control tissue. Rapid ALS cases had more dendritic cells than slow ALS cases, whereas slow ALS cases had more activated microglia than rapid cases. Our findings demonstrate a persistent and prominent activation of both innate and adaptive immunity in ALS. We propose a complement-driven immune response which may contribute to the progression of the inflammation and ultimately lead to even more motor neuron injury. 24 Steele L, Sastre A, Gerkovich MM, Cook MR (2012) Complex Factors in the Etiology of Gulf War Illness: Wartime Exposures and Risk Factors in Veteran Subgroups. Environ Health Perspect 120:112-118. (Epub 2011 Sep 19.) Abstract: BACKGROUND: At least one-fourth of U.S. veterans who served in the 1990- 1991 Gulf War are affected by the chronic symptomatic illness known as Gulf War illness (GWI). Clear determination of the causes of GWI has been hindered by many factors, including limitations in how epidemiologic studies have assessed the impact of the complex deployment environment on veterans' health. OBJECTIVE: We sought to address GWI etiologic questions by evaluating the association of symptomatic illness with characteristics of veterans' deployment. METHODS: We compared veteran-reported wartime experiences in a population-based sample of 304 Gulf War veterans: 144 cases who met preestablished criteria for GWI and 160 controls. Veteran subgroups and confounding among deployment variables were considered in the analyses. RESULTS: Deployment experiences and the prevalence of GWI differed significantly by veterans' location in theater. Among personnel who were in Iraq or Kuwait, where all battles took place, GWI was most strongly associated with using pyridostigmine bromide pills [odds ratio (OR) = 3.5; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7, 7.4] and being within 1 mile of an exploding SCUD missile (OR = 3.1; 95% CI: 1.5, 6.1). For veterans who remained in support areas, GWI was significantly associated only with personal pesticide use, with increased prevalence (OR = 12.7; 95% CI: 2.6, 61.5) in the relatively small subgroup that wore pesticide-treated uniforms, nearly all of whom also used skin pesticides. Combat service was not significantly associated with GWI. CONCLUSIONS: Findings support a role for a limited number of wartime exposures in the etiology of GWI, which differed in importance with the deployment milieu in which veterans served. Sternke LM (2011) Measurement of military combat exposure among women: analysis and implications. Womens Health Issues 21(4 Suppl):S160-168.) Abstract: PURPOSE: To examine combat exposure measurement instruments utilized since the Vietnam War, determine how these instruments were developed and psychometrically tested, and if they are appropriate for use with women veterans exposed to combat. METHODS: A literature search for articles concerning combat exposure instruments, their development, and their psychometric properties in relation to women was conducted in several electronic databases. Limited MeSH subject headings required keyword searches with terms such as combat stress, war trauma, and deployment stressors. Instruments were selected for analysis based on their inclusion of combat and combat-related traumatic event measures. RESULTS: Eight instruments were retained for critical appraisal. The majority of instruments were developed and validated based on male veterans' combat experiences from the Vietnam War through the Gulf War. Located instruments explained their methodological development and indicated the type of exposure being measured. Reliability measures for the majority were acceptable, and validity was established to varying degrees and with different methods. Limitations of all instruments included retrospective self-reporting, potential recall error, and the inability to validate individual exposure objectively. CONCLUSION: Women veterans are substantially under-represented in the development and psychometric testing of combat exposure instruments, indicating a male gender bias in most combat measures. Only two instruments utilized women veterans in their validation samples, and six instruments used gender-neutral terminology. Instruments developed and validated with male veterans for specific military conflicts may not reflect the combat experiences of women. Torres-Altoro MI, Mathur BN, Drerup JM, dysregulate dopamine glutamatergic in striatum. J Neurochem 119:303-313. Abstract: The neurological effects o f organophosphate (OP) pesticides, commonly used on foods and in households, are an important public health concern. Furthermore, subclinical exposure to combinations of organophosphates is implicated in Gulf War illness. Here, we characterized the effects of the broadly used insecticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) on subunit of -amino-3-hydroxy-5- methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in mouse brain slices. It also increased GluR1 phosphorylation by PKA when administered systemically. This correlated with enhanced glutamate release from cortical projections in rat striatum. Similar effects were induced by the sarin congener, diisopropyl fluorophosphate, alone or in combination pyridostigmine bromide and the pesticide N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET). This combination, meant to mimic the neurotoxicant exposure encountered by veterans of the 1991 Persian Gulf War, also induced hyperphosphorylation of the neurofibrillary tangle-associated protein tau. Diisopropyl fluorophosphate and pyrodostigmine bromide, alone or in combination, also increased the aberrant activity of the protein kinase, Cdk5, as 25 indicated by conversion of its activating cofactor p35 to p25. Thus, consistent with recent findings in humans and animals, organophosphate exposure causes dysregulation in the motor/reward circuitry and invokes mechanisms associated with neurological disorders and neurodegeneration. Wakil A, Sathyapalan T, Atkin SL (2011) Pituitary hypophysitis and gulf war series and hypothesis. Clin Endocrinol (Oxf) 75:272-274. Summary: Although the cause of GWS remains unidentified, recent studies have hypothesized that permanent psychogenic stress coupled with high antigen loading leading to gradual depletion of HPA axis, which is manifested by the reduction of stress-induced cortisol response. The explanation for the high frequency of abnormal anterior pituitary function in our series could be offered by the above hypothesis of chronic stress, although our findings were not exclusive to the HPA axis, perhaps indicating a more diffuse effect on the anterior pituitary than originally hypothesized. Furthermore, in the five subjects who tolerated the hormonal replacement therapy, the administered health questionnaire showed a significant improvement in the scores after replacement, although this improvement was not substantial which indicates that there could be other causesfor the multitude of symptoms encountered by GWV. In conclusion, our case series shows unusually high clustering of abnormal pituitary dynamic tests in GWV with the GWS possibly related to immunogenic hypophysitis. This may help explain some of the complex and multiple symptoms experienced by those afflicted by GWS.

Mil Med 176:896-902. Abstract: A previous study (Haley RW, Marshall WW, McDonald GG, Daugherty MA, Petty F, Fleckenstein JL: Brain abnormalities in Gulf War MR spectroscopy. Radiology 2000; 215: 807-817) suggested that individuals with Gulf War Illness (GWI) had reduced quantities of the neuronal marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the basal ganglia and pons. This study aimed to determine whether NAA is reduced in these regions and to investigate correlations with other possible causes of GWI, such as psychological response to stress in a large cohort of Gulf War veterans. Individuals underwent tests to determine their physical and psychological health and to identify veterans with (n=81) and without (n=97) GWI. When concentrations of NAA and ratios of NAA to creatine- and choline-containing metabolites were measured in the basal ganglia and pons, no significant differences were found between veterans with or without GWI, suggesting that GWI is not associated with reduced NAA in these regions. Veterans with GWI had significantly higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, supporting the idea that GWI symptoms are stress related.

(Epub 2011 Feb 25.) Abstract: The simultaneous use of the repellent DEET, pyridostigmine, and organophosphorus pesticides has been assumed as a potential cause for the Gulf War Illness and combinations have been tested in different animal models. However, human in vitro data on interactions of DEET with other compounds are scarce and provoked the present in vitro study scrutinizing the interactions of DEET, pyridostigmine and pesticides with human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (hBChE). DEET showed to be a and reversible inhibitor of hAChE and hBChE. The IC(50) of DEET for hAChE and DEET malaoxon and chlorpyrifos oxon with hAChE in the presence of 5mM DEET resulted in a moderate reduction of the inhibition rate constant k(i). The decarbamoylation velocity of pyridostigmine-inhibited hAChE was not affected by DEET. In conclusion, the in vitro investigation of interactions between human cholinesterases, DEET, pyridostigmine, malaoxon and DEET. The inhibitory potency of the tested cholinesterase inhibitors was not enhanced by DEET and it did not affect the regeneration velocity of pyridostigmine-inhibited AChE. Hence, this in vitro study does not give any evidence of a synergistic effect of the tested compounds on human cholinesterases.

Summary: No convincing mechanism for the postulated synergistic effect of pyridostigmine, DEET and other compounds in animal studies could be defined and the results of our investigation suggest that no synergism at human cholinesterases exists. 26 Yan M, Zhong G, Gao L, Xia X, Wang L, Hu H, Weng S (2011) Effects of uranium depletion on 1 -hydroxylase in kidney of rats. Hum Exp Toxicol 30:786-790. Abstract: This study was designed to evaluate the effects of depleted uranium (DU) on 1-hydroxylase in the kidney of rats and to delineate the mechanism of damage to kidneys and bones by DU. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were surgically implanted with DU fragments at three dose levels (0.1 g, 0.2 g and 0.3 g). After 3, 6 or 12 months, the concentration of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in the kidney was measured by radioimmunoassay. The activity of 1-hydroxylase was shown by the production of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) after incubation. The results showed that the 1 -hydroxylase activity in the kidney was decreased after 3 months (27.2% at the medium dose DU group, p < 0.05; 33.4% at the high dose DU group, p < 0.01). In contrast, at 6 months and 12 months after implantation of DU, the activity of renal 1 -hydroxylase in DU-treated animals was not decreased significantly in comparison with the controls (p > 0.05). On the other hand, the activity of renal 1-hydroxylase was decreased by 33.1% (p < 0.05) and 34.4% (p < 0.01) in blank control groups at 6 and 12 months, respectively, when compared with the blank control group at 3 months. In conclusion, this study showed that chronic DU exposure could induce renal damages and inhibit the synthesis of biologically active form of vitamin D, which may be the underlying mechanism of bone metabolic disorder caused by renal injury after DU exposure.

Toxicology 286:75-84. (Epub 2011 May 27.) Abstract: Occupational internal contamination with depleted uranium (DU) compounds can induce radiological and chemical toxicity, and an effective and specific uranium-chelating agent for clinical use is urgently needed. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a series of synthesized water-soluble metal-ion-imprinted chitooligosaccharides can be used as uranium-specific chelating agents, because the chitooligosaccharides have excellent heavy metal ion chelation property and the ion-imprinting technology can improve the selective recognition of template ions. DU-poisoned human renal proximal tubule epithelium cells (human kidney 2 cells, HK-2) were used to assess the detoxification of these chitooligosaccharides. The DU-chelating capacity and selectivity of the chitooligosaccharides were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Cell viability, cellular accumulation of DU, membrane damage, DNA damage, and morphological changes in the cellular ultrastructure were examined to assess the detoxification of these chitooligosaccharides. The results showed that the DU effectively and specifically, and significantly reduced the loss of cell viability induced by DU and reduced cellular accumulation of DU in a dose-dependent manner, owing to their chelation of DU outside cells and their prevention of DU internalization. The ultrastructure observation clearly showed that Cu-Glu-CMC-chelated- DU precipitates, mostly outside cells, were grouped in significantly larger clusters, and they barely entered the cells by endocytosis or in any other way. Treatment with Cu-Glu-CMC also increased the activity of antioxidant enzymes, and reduced membrane damage and DNA damage induced by DU oxidant injury. Cu-Glu-CMC was more effective than the positive control drug, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA), in protection of HK-2 cells against DU cytotoxicity, as a result of its chelation of UO \u00b2 to prevent the DU internalization and its antioxidant activity. IV. RESEARCH FUNDING TRENDS This section provides a quantitative overview of the current research portfolio on GWVI and the evolution of the portfolio since 1999. Topics that are covered include research expenditures by VA, DoD, and HHS from FY 2002- 2011, and the number of research projects in which the Federal Government has invested. T he appropriated funds for FY 2002 through 2011, centrally obligated to each project, are shown in Appendix C and summarized in Table IV-1. Federal funding for GW research totaled approximately $ 230 million during this period. Funds obligated for these projects prior to FY 2002 are not shown in either Table IV-1 or Appendix C. Since many projects are multi-year efforts for which funds are obligated at the beginning of the project period, projects that received all of their funds prior to FY 2002 are listed with no associated obligation ($0) in Appendix C. Federal funds for these earlier projects were reported in prior Annual Reports to Congress . Table IV-1. 10-Year (FY 2002-2011) Funding Trends for GW in DoD $ 18.8 $ 16.4 $ 11.1 $ 10.1 $ 10.1 $ 3.4 $ 11.7 $ 10.4 $ 10.4 $ 3.3 $ 105. 7 HHS $ 0.8 $ 1.0 $ 0.5 $ 0.5 $ 0.4 $ 0.4 $ 0.4 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 4.0 VA $ 4.5 $ 5.7 $ 7.6 $ 9.5 $13.0 $22.1 $ 21.9 $ 16.6 $ 13.9 $ 5.6 $ 120.4 Total $ 24.1 $ 23.1 $19.2 $ 20.1 $ 23.5 $ 25.9 $ 34.0 $ 27.0 $ 24.3 $ 8.9 $ 230.1 The funding level for FY 2010 in the table above differs from the value reported in the 2010 Annual Report to Congress due to the delayed start of thirteen projects funded through the FY 2010 appropriation for the Gulf War Illness Research (GWIRP) managed by the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) at DoD . The DoD funding for FY2011 is $3.3M for the same reason and will be updated in the 2012 Annual Report to Congress after the projects have begun. VA, Do D, and HHS sponsored a total of 400 distinct research projects on GWVI during the period of FY 1992 through FY 2011. Appendix A lists all of the research and development projects and programs supported now or in the past by each of the three Federal agencies (DoD, HHS, and VA). Nine projects have been dual-funded by VA and DoD, and each agency has given the project its own unique Reports to Congress , the total number of funded projects was corrected for the number of dual funded projects. Starting with the 2005 Annual Report to Congress , this practice has been discontinued since VA and DoD may start or end funding of their portion of these projects independent of each other. Each dual-funded project is, therefore, treated as two distinct projects. Th e numbers of new, ongoing and completed projects for FY 2002 - FY 2011 are shown in Figure IV-1. As of September 30, 2011 , 339 projects ( 85 percent of the 400 projects) were completed, and 61 projects ( 15 percent) were new or ongoing; the numbers of new, ongoing, and completed projects for each fiscal year are shown in Figure IV-1. The annual distribution of new and ongoing projects within the five major Research Focus Areas is shown in Figure IV-2. From FY 2002 through 2011 new and ongoing research assigned to the Brain and Nervous System Function, Environmental Toxicology and General Health and Symptoms categories has represented 96.3 \u00b1 1.0 percent of all new and ongoing projects. Figure IV -1. Cumulative Number of Funded Projects (FY 2002 - FY 201 1) 28 Figure IV -2. Annual Distribution of Topic Areas for New and Ongoing Projects 29 VA has also initiated programs to facilitate researchers' access to Veterans who are willing to participate in research studies. The Gulf War Era Cohort and Biorepository began collecting medical information and a blood sample from Veteran volunteers who can subsequently be contacted by researchers and invited into a research study. Similarly, the Million Veteran Program creates access to Veterans from all conflicts and all time periods (including the Gulf War era). Providing researchers access to these Veteran databases allows them to select a study group which enables them to target specific symptoms or conditions as they investigate diagnostic markers or develop treatments. V. NEW RESEARCH PROJECTS AND INITIATIVES A. New Initiatives Requests for Applications (RFAs) were issued by both CDMRP and VA in FY 2011. Proposals received for review in response to these RFAs will be reviewed, and projects selected for funding will begin in FY 2012. VA began the process of creating a Gulf War Research Strategic Plan to map the direction of research for the next five years, with the focus on converting promising research results into clinical treatments and determining genetic links to Veterans' symptoms. Considerable effort is also focused on increasing the number of investigators involved in Gulf War research. In the short term, a meeting of active VA Gulf War researchers will encourage collaborations and mentoring of young investigators, and special RFAs will supplement existing RFAs to target specific new research areas. Longer term plans include posting videos on VA websites which contain research presentations for interested investigators to review. With more researchers and more projects, more progress can be made in developing treatments and diagnostic capabilities. VA and DoD will work more closely to foster Gulf War research, and Gulf War researchers will meet regularly to build collaborative relationships. B. Portfolio Review VA and DoD each review their portfolios of Gulf War research on a regular basis in order to determine research gaps and to expand successful research topic areas. The Federal Gulf War research portfolio is increasingly focused on identifying potential new treatments (clinical trials, including complementary medicine approaches) for ill GW Veterans and identifying new diagnostic markers of disease and potential therapeutic targets to develop new therapies. VA and DoD continue to share information regarding funded Gulf War research projects and coordinate activities, whenever possible, to maximize combined program impact. To facilitate this process, the Gulf War research programs will also be integrated into the on- going department-wide VA-DoD Joint Program Reviews. C. New Projects This section highlights the new research projects that have been approved since last year's 2010 Annual Report to Congress . Projects preceded by an asterisk (*) were either funded using funds appropriated in prior years or approved for funding in prior fiscal years, but not identified in previous Annual Reports to Congress . They are described below and incorporated into the tables in Appendices A, B and C. Among these projects are exciting new approaches to treating and diagnosing Gulf War Veterans. Several studies address the management of chronic pain. Alternative methods, such as mindfulness training, are being used to deal with chronic pain as are the more traditional pharmaceutical treatments although innovations in rapid delivery procedures may be able to target the pain more effectively. Exercise training for chronic pain is being coupled to magnetic resonance imaging to determine how the brain responds to the treatments. With regard to the health effects of environmental exposures, genomic and epigenetic studies are underway to investigate the genetic factors that make some Veterans more susceptible to the various materials that they were exposed to in the Persian Gulf, and some research is still aimed at the exposures themselves. Sleep apnea is a common problem which is being addressed in studies including investigations of the neurobiology of the condition, better breathing apparatuses for minimizing the effects of sleep apnea, and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) methods of reducing sleep disturbances. 30 Department of Defense (DoD) Thir teen projects were funded through the FY 2010 appropriation for the Gulf War Illness Research Program (GWIRP) managed by the CDMRP, but did not start until FY 2011. These projects focused on Brain and Nervous System Function (3), Environmental Toxicology (1), and Symptoms and General Health (9 ). *DoD- 200, \"XMRV and GWI: Is There an Association?\" has shifted from a focus on XMRV to look for the presence of any infectious pathogen by performing a transcriptome and genome analysis on archived peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from ill Gulf War Veterans. *DoD- 201, \"Synergistic Actions of Pyridostigmine Bromide and Insecticides on Muscle and Vascular Nociceptors\" will examine whether the pyridostigmine bromide (which was taken for protection against nerve agents) and insecticides that Gulf War Veterans were exposed to act in a synergistic way to cause musculoskeletal pain. The study will further test the capacity of pharmaceutical agents to reverse neurotoxicant-dependent pain. *DoD- 202, \"Brain -Immune Interactions as Basis of Gulf War Illness: Consortium Development\" will plan to create a consortium of researchers investigating the pathobiological mechanisms of chronic multisymptom illness in Gulf War Veterans and identify biomarkers that can be translated into future clinical treatment trials. Studies will also target suspected brain-immune signaling alterations in chronic multisymptom illness in Gulf War Veterans. *DoD- 203, \"Redefining Gulf War Illness Using Longitudinal Health Data: The Devens Cohort\" will examine the current health status of Gulf War Veterans from Ft Devens, who were also surveyed shortly after the war, to capture the remitting, relapsing, and consistent nature of the conditions which are specific to Gulf War Veterans and to better understand the causes driving these symptoms (i.e., genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, prior treatment efficacy). *DoD- 204, \"Nasal Irrigation for Chronic Rhinosinusitis and Fatigue in Patients with Gulf War Syndrome\" will investigate whether nasal irrigation with saline solutions and therapeutic drugs can reduce the occurrence of chronic sinusitis and thereby reduce the level of fatigue in Gulf War Veterans affected with this problem. *DoD- 205, \"The HPA Axis and Metabolic Outcomes in Gulf War Veterans\" is designed to further characterize the nature and extent of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis alterations associated with chronic multisymptom illness in GW veterans and the relationship of these HPA axis alterations to adverse metabolic outcomes. *DoD- 206, \"Investigating Clinical Benefits of a Novel Sleep -Focused, Mind-Body Program on Gulf War Illness Symptoms: An Exploratory Randomized Controlled Trial\" will examine the extent to which two sleep-targeted interventions, Mind Body Bridging (MBB) and Supportive Education (SED) can be used to improve the general health, physical function, and functional impairment in ill Gulf War Veterans. *DoD- 207, \"Gulf War Illness Research Development Consortium (GWIC)\" will develop and plan a multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional consortium focused on discovering the key mediators and pathophysiology underlying chronic multisymptom illness in Gulf War Veterans and further translating those discoveries into innovative treatments. *DoD- 208, \"Genome -Wide Association Study of a Validated Case Definition of Gulf War Illness in a Population- Representative Sample\" will perform a whole genome gene-expression study of a validated case definition of chronic multisymptom illness in Gulf War Veterans in a population-representative sample of Gulf War veterans to identify new targets for rational development of new diagnostic and treatment approaches. *DoD- 209, \" Proteomic Immune Profiling for the Therapeutic Modulation of Cognitive Impairment in a Novel GWI Mouse Model\" will measure concentrations of specific proteins related to cognitive function in mice to determine if any of them can serve as a biomarker for diagnosing or treating chronic multisymptom illness in Gulf War Veterans. *DoD -210, \"Assessment of Diverse Biological Indicators in Gulf War Illness: Are They Replicable? Are They Related?\" will utilize a case-control design to evaluate diverse biological measures in a single, well-characterized sample of 120 Gulf War era veterans. Analyses will determine which measures significantly distinguish ill Gulf War 31 Veterans from controls and will explore the extent to which biological findings are interrelated or are associated with identifiable veteran subgroups. *DoD- 211, \"Detection of Xenotropic Murine L eukemia War Illness: Role in Pathogenesis or Biomarker?\" has expanded the original focus from XMRV-only and will conduct lymphocyte transcriptome analysis of Gulf War Veterans diagnosed with chronic multisymptom illness and compare the results to the same analysis of healthy control subjects. These analyses will provide a better understanding of the innate immune system and potential associated opportunistic pathogens affecting Gulf War Veterans. *DoD- 212, \"Integrative Physiology of Gulf War Illness: Role of Autonomic Function, Central Neural Processing, and Sleep\" will develop and plan a research consortium to study specific physiological changes in brain-based pain- regulatory or sleep-regulatory problems, autonomic nervous system (ANS) impairment, and immune dysfunction and to develop treatments for Gulf War Veterans based on those changes. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) VA initiated funding for nine new projects during FY 2011. These nine projects focused on Brain and Nervous System Function (4), Environmental Toxicology (1), and Symptoms and General Health (4 ). VA-165, \"A Pilot Study of CPAP Adherence Promotion by Peer Buddies with Sleep Apnea\" is designed to assess the feasibility and acceptability of having members of a peer group assist one another in using their continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices to alleviate the problems associated with sleep apnea. VA-1 66, \"A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Mindfulness -Based Intervention for Gulf War Syndrome\" will use an 8- week group-based class called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to determine if the treatment can affect general health, physical function, fatigue and functional impairment related to pain in ill Gulf War Veterans. VA-167, \" Ne uroprotection and Myelin Repair Mechanisms in Multiple Sclerosis \" will use a mouse model to evaluate the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in protecting neurons from inflammatory damage and in promoting myelin repair. Understanding this process should lead to improved treatment and management of neurodegenerative diseases like MS. VA-168, \" Sleep Neurobiology and Circuitry \" will use a gene transfer method to repair the network of neurons that controls waking, REM sleep, and non-REM sleep in mouse models. It is hypothesized that targeted deletions in the hypocretin gene will help to correct sleep disorders. VA-169, \"Prevention of Hippocampal Neurodegeneration Due to Age and Apnea\" will examine pharmaceutical approaches to minimizing adverse changes in the hippocampus as Veterans age and deal with sleep apnea. Changes in the hippocampus have been implicated in cognitive illnesses in Gulf War Veterans. VA-170, \" Epigenetic Mechanisms Relevant to the Pathogenesis of ALS \" will use a mouse model to determine whether LSD1 (an enzyme which regulates protein methylation) induces the degeneration of neurons similar to that observed in ALS. The effects of LDS1 inhibitors on the process will also be studied. Epigenetic control of enzyme activity is a possible method for modifying the progression of ALS. VA-171, \" Nanoparticle Coupled Antioxidants for Respiratory Illness in Veterans \" will involve in vitro and in vivo (animal) studies to determine whether antioxidants can be attached to nanoparticles applied to the lining of the upper respiratory tract to deactivate reactive chemicals in smoke and on diesel exhaust particles, as encountered in SWA. VA-172, \" Understanding Pain of Gastrointestinal Origin in Women that Serve in OEF/OIF \" will study the mechanisms responsible for the gender-related differences in intestinal sensitivity that lead to chronic abdominal pain in female Veterans. Results for OEF/OIF will be compared to those for Gulf War Veterans. VA-173, \"Impact of Exercise Training on Pain and Brain Function in Gulf War Veterans\" will examine whether resistance exercise training (RET) is a useful treatment of Gulf War Veterans suffering from chronic musculoskeletal pain and if neuroimaging techniques can determine how the brains of Veterans respond to musculoskeletal pain. 32 VI.

These funds also cover operational costs foradministration, infrastructure, etc. Each department allocates these costs in slightly different ways, making it difficult to completely account for these funds. For example, in VA the research appropriation does not pay for clinician/investigator salaries. By law those funds must come from the patient care appropriation. These salary costs are not included in the obligated costs listed in the table. 2.A \"blank\" funding entry generally reflects years in which a project was not active (e.g., it had not started or it had come to an end). 3.Some multiyear projects receive all of their funding in the fiscal year of the authorization and appropriation. For those, the dollars authorized and obligated are shown for that fiscal year. The remaining funding entries show $0 for the years that the project is active. 4.Although all projects funded from FY 1992-2010 are listed, only the financial data for FY 2002-2011 (a 10-year window) are shown in Appendix C; Totals for FY '02-'11 do not include funds obligated in FY 1992-2000. Projects that received all of their obligated funds prior to FY 2002 will, therefore, appear inthe table as having no funding. 5.Some intramural projects/programs are supported out of operational costs. For those projects, $0 isentered for the funds in the fiscal years that the project is active. 6.Programs consisting of multiple projects are represented in one of two ways depending on how funds are centrally obligated: a.Funds centrally obligated to the program : These programs are shown in the table as a main program indicated by project designation such as DoD-1, and projects within the program as DoD-1A,DoD-1B, etc. All funds are shown under the main program. Blank funding entries are shown for the individual projects. b.Funds centrally obligated to projects within a program : The funds for these programs are only indicated by their projects without a main program identifier, for example, VA-2A and VA-2B. Specific Notes 1.DoD-4 is part of a larger US Army study conducted at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Funding for this project has been combined into project DoD-23. In addition, projects DoD-8A and 8B are part of a larger US Army study in which all funding has been combined and is shown under program DoD-8. 2.HHS -3 was funded from the FY'91 appropriation, which is not included in this accounting. 3.HHS -4 was funded from the FY'93 appropriation, which is not included in t his accounting. 4.Funds for VA- 1 for FY'94 through FY'97 represent an aggregate of funds for both the VA Mortality Study and the VA National Survey of Persian Gulf Veterans. Beginning in FY'98, VA -1 reflects continuation of the VA Mortality Study. Beginning in FY'98, VA-2A, 2B, and 2C reflect funding for separate components of the VA National Survey of Persian Gulf Veterans. 5.In nine instances (DoD-115 & VA-88), two different designations represent the same project because both DoD and VAfunded them jointly. The total funding appropriated for each of these nine projects is broken down and reported separately by funding agency. 2011 Annual Report to Congress on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses - APPENDIX C 82 Department of Defense Gulf War Research Funding PROJECT NO PROJECT TITLE STATUS FY 2002 FY 2003 FY2004 FY 2011 Health Study Program C $0 DoD-001 A Epidemiologic Studies of Morbidity Among Gulf War Veterans: A Search for Etiologic Agents and Risk Factors; A Study of Symptoms Among 1500 Seabees C $0 DoD-001 B Epidemiologic Studies of Morbidity Among Gulf War Veterans: A Search for Etiologic Agents and Risk Factors; Study 2: A Comparative Study of Hospitalizations among Active-Duty Personnel Who Participated in the Gulf War and Similar Personnel Who Did Not.
