Plant-based medicine is the oldest form of healing and herbal medicine is still used by over 80 percent of the world's population. For centuries, cultures throughout the world have used herbs and creating healing modalities forming the basis of Western Herbal Medicine, Ayurvedic Herbal Medicine, and Traditional Chinese Medicine. Modern science is now confirming what tradition has known for centuries. Herbs have therapeutic properties, which can be used in the prevention of ill health, assist in maintaining optimal health and play a valid role in the treatment of dis-ease. While clinical trials should not be considered the only validation of botanical medicine, double-blind placebo-controlled studies can certainly confirm the role of the plant for medicine, a healing modality practiced for centuries. Botanical medicine, when used correctly, plays an important role in the treatment of ill health and can be used for both acute and chronic conditions. Both herbal medicine and allopathic (pharmaceutical) medicine can play a valid role in our health. Herbs can be used as the first choice of disease treatment and herbal medicines consistently have fewer side effects than prescription medication while supporting the bodies' capacity to heal itself. When used under the care of a trained practitioner, the benefits of the botanical medicine are numerous. Herbs can be safely combined with allopathic medicine to minimize the side effects of prescription drugs, used to enhance the effect of pharmaceutical medicines, resulting in a lower dose of medication needed, or can be used long-term to support the bodies' capacity to restore its own health. Herbal medicine can be used to wean the body off potentially addictive medications and can be used as an alternative to many habit-forming medications. There are herbal formulations to support the bodies healing for almost any condition one might see a doctor for. The quest for knowledge and understanding in the field of herbal medicine is continually advancing. There are currently Bachelor of Science and Master of Science Degree programs in Herbal Medicine in Universities throughout the world. Medical schools are adding herbal medicine education into their course curriculums; peer-reviewed journals are citing the health benefits of nutrition and plant medicine and there is an increase in funding and research done on botanical medicine throughout the world. Western Herbal Medicine uses local medicinal plants, First Nations plants as well as European herbs and often incorporated herbs from other paradigms as well including Ayurvedic plant medicine and herbs traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicine.
