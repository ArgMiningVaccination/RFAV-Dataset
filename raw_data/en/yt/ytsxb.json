This study examined incremental costs of acute kidney injury (AKI) complications from percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is a common and severe complication. Out of a sample of over 1.4 million PCI patients at 518 US hospitals from 2006 to 2015, AKI occurred in 5.73% of PCI patients. Those with AKI had at least double the hospitalization costs and the incremental cost was $9,448. It was also independently associated with an incremental length of stay of 3.6 days. AKI cost burden was extrapolated at 411.3 million US dollars annually. AHRQ-funded; HS022481. Citation: Amin AP, McNeely C, Spertus JA .

This study analyzed performance gaps of practicing anesthesiologists, and used 4 different scenarios that illustrate those gaps and how they contribute to hazards in anesthesiology and proposals for addressing them. The authors used 4 standardized simulated scenarios of common events that anesthesiologists would expect to see in their practice. The 4 perioperative crisis events are: (1) local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) leading to hemodynamic collapse; (2) retroperitoneal bleeding from insertion of a trocar leading to hemorrhagic shock; (3) malignant hyperthermia (MH) presenting in the postanesthesia care unit; and (4) acute atrial fibrillation with hemodynamic instability, followed by signs of a ST-elevation myocardial infarction (AFib-MI). These scenarios came from a 2017 paper by Weinger, et al. A group of subject matter experts defined a set of clinical performance elements (CPEs) that they would expect to be performed in the scenarios. Only 4% of encounters in these scenarios had perfect performance by anesthesiologists where all prescribed CPEs were performed. Recommendations for improvement included providing high-fidelity simulation training, incorporating clinical lessons about gaps, fostering regular use by anesthesiologists and OR teams of clinical guidance, modifying organizational arrangements at clinical sites to ensure backup help is readily available, and implementing periodic formative performance assessments.

Central-line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) cause morbidity and mortality in critically ill children. In this study the investigators examined novel and/or modifiable risk factors for CLABSI to identify new potential targets for infection prevention strategies. They found that novel risk factors for CLABSI in PICU patients included acute behavioral health needs and >80 CVC accessed in the 3 days before CLABSI. They suggest that interventions focused on these factors may reduce CLABSIs in this high-risk population. risk factors for central-line associated bloodstream infections in critically ill children. Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 2020 Safety Woods-Hill CZ, Koontz DW, King AF Practices, perceptions, and attitudes in the evaluation of critically ill children for bacteremia: a national survey. Sending blood cultures in children at low risk of bacteremia can contribute to a cascade of unnecessary antibiotic exposure, adverse effects, and increased costs. In this study, the investigators aimed to describe practice variation, clinician beliefs, and attitudes about blood culture testing in critically ill children. They concluded that there is variation in blood culture practices in the pediatric ICU. Fear and reflexive habits are common drivers of cultures. These practices may contribute to perceptions, and attitudes in the evaluation of critically ill children for bacteremia: a national survey.

This study examined the effects of allowing patients with mild-moderate chronic kidney disease to use metformin. The researchers examined rates of reports of metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) to FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Publicly available data from 2015 to 2018 was analyzed. Reports from the US increased from 111 in 2015 to 243 in 2018. However due to a lack of a denominator or control group they could not conclude US MALA rates have increased. The authors also concluded that while the increased reports deserve attention, further study is needed. AHRQ-funded; HS023898.

This study examined reasons why end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis experience frequent complications and hospitalizations. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with 21 patients living with ESRD, 10 caregivers, and three focus groups with health care professionals. There were four main themes that came out of the discussions: graft site/catheter/access issues, low resistance, breathing problems, and \"The perfect storm\". The goal of these interviews were to promote more research to improve transitional care and care delivery for hemodialysis patients. storm: stakeholder perspectives on factors contributing to hospital admissions for patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.

This article is a call to action for pediatric solid organ transplant recipients to receive their recommended immunizations. Vaccine-preventable infections (VIPs) occur in 1 in 6 pediatric transplant recipients and these hospitalizations result in significant morbidity, mortality, graft injury, and cost. There has been an increase in the overall population in non-medical vaccine exemptions, which reduces herd immunity and creates greater risk for patients undergoing or already having received transplants.

Researchers sought to test the usability and feasibility of Brain Buddy, a consumer-facing mobile health technology designed to inform and empower older adults to consider the risks and benefits of anticholinergics. Primary care patients aged 60 years or older who used anticholinergic medications participated in task-based usability testing of Brain Buddy; usability was assessed by the System Usability Scale, and performance-based usability data collected for each task through observation. The researchers found that overall usability was acceptable or better, with 100% of participants completing each Brain Buddy task. Observed usability issues included higher rates of errors, hesitations, and need for assistance on tasks. They conclude that user-centered design and evaluation with demographically heterogeneous clinical samples uncovers correctable usability issues and confirms the value of interventions targeting consumers as agents in shared decision making and behavior change.

AZ, Ratwani RM Identifying potential patient safety issues from the federal electronic health record surveillance program. This research letter analyzed HHS' Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) surveillance data on electronic health records (EHRs) to determine whether these vendor products may potentially create patient harm. The researchers analyzed records from 195 vendors and identified 3.7% total product IDs having a nonconformity issue that could be a contributing factor to a patient harm event. However, it is unknown whether these IDs might actually result in patient potential patient safety issues from the federal electronic health record surveillance program.

Despite increased focus on opioid prescribing, little is known about the influence of prescription opioid medication information given to patients in the emergency department (ED). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of an Electronic Medication Complete Communication (EMC(2)) Opioid Strategy on patients' safe use of opioids and knowledge about opioids. The study found that the EMC(2) tools improved demonstrated safe dosing, but these benefits did not translate into actual use based on medication dairies. The text-messaging intervention did result in improved patient knowledge. AHRQ-funded; HS023459. Citation: McCarthy DM, Curtis LM, Courtney DM .

The purpose of this study was to test if acute kidney injury (AKI) is preventable in patients in the neonatal intensive care unit and if infants at high-risk of nephrotoxic medication-induced AKI can be identified using a systematic surveillance program previously used in the pediatric non-intensive care unit setting. The authors concluded that a systematic surveillance program to identify high-risk infants can prevent nephrotoxic-induced AKI and has the potential to prevent short and long-term consequences of AKI in critically ill infants.

In this narrative review, the authors discuss how the concept of diagnostic errors framed as missed opportunities can be applied to the non-linear nature of diagnosis in a critical care environment such as the NICU. They then explore how the etiology of an error in diagnosis can be related to both individual cognitive factors as well as organizational and systemic factors - all of which often contribute to the error.

In this paper, the investigators discuss how the need to develop measures to improve diagnostic performance could move forward at a time when the scientific foundation needed to inform measurement is still evolving. They highlight challenges and opportunities for developing potential measures of \"diagnostic safety\" related to clinical diagnostic errors and associated preventable diagnostic harm. In doing so, they propose a starter set of measurement concepts for initial consideration that seem reasonably related to diagnostic safety and call for these to be studied and further refined.

Researchers investigated the relationship between patient safety culture, health information technology (IT) implementation, and the frequency of problems that could lead to diagnostic errors in the medical office setting. Using survey data from the 2012 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Medical Office Surveys on Patient Safety Culture database, they found that the most frequent problem was \"results from a lab or imaging test were not available when needed,\" with 15% of respondents reporting that it happened daily or weekly. Higher overall culture scores were significantly associated with fewer occurrences of each problem assessed, and offices in the process of health IT implementation had higher frequency of problems.

The goal of this cohort study was to describe youth initiating prescription benzodiazepine treatment, identify potential indications and prescribing concerns, estimate the duration of treatment by potential indication, and identify factors that predict long-term use. Investigators found that U.S. children and adolescents are prescribed benzodiazepines for various mental health and other medical conditions, many lacking evidence of pediatric efficacy. They concluded that long-term benzodiazepine treatment, concurrent opioid prescriptions, psychotropic use, and prior substance use disorder diagnoses suggest safety risks among some youth prescribed benzodiazepines.

The authors identified the prevalence of and factors associated with having a designated nurse peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) team among U.S. acute care hospitals. They found that nurse PICC teams inserted PICCs in more than 60% of U.S. hospitals during the study period. Moreover, certain practices to prevent central line-associated bloodstream infection, including maximum sterile barrier precautions, chlorhexidine gluconate for insertion site antisepsis, and facility-wide insertion checklists were regularly used by a higher percentage of hospitals with nurse PICC teams compared with those without. They concluded that nurse PICC teams play an integral role in PICC use at many hospitals and that use of such teams may promote key practices to prevent complications. AHRQ-funded; HS022835.
