Summary of Research In April 2018, I was awarded a Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program (TRDRP) grant for the High Impact Research Project Award mechanism. The proposed studies investigate the cellular and molecular identity of neurons undergoing neurotransmitter plasticity occurring in the developing reward centers of the brain and the mechanism affecting reward-seeking behaviors towards substances of abuse, including nicotine and marijuana. We used Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in preclinical research conducted on laboratory mice to investigate the developmental effects of prenatal (3mg/kg) and perinatal (3mg/ kg) THC administration over on development of cortical (mPFC) GABAergic interneurons and Dopamine neurons of the reward center (VTA). Our pilot experiments on THC exposure were performed delivering THC to pups through THC-loaded osmotic pump implanted in the pregnant or nursing mom then to adults via IP injections and Delta-9 THC was detected in the mouse blood. Due to the pandemic and university closure, we were unable to perform the experiments we had planned for the past year. B. Research plans In the upcoming calendar year, postdoctoral fellow Dr. Martina Ulivieri, will perform several cohort of THC exposure experiments. THC-treated pups will be raised normally until adulthood (P60) then exposed to a second THC challenge (10 mg/kg/day, 2 weeks) and sacrifced soon after (75). Brain tissue will be processed for immunohistochemical analysis of neurotransmitter markers in mPFC and VTA regions. No additional controlled substances are planned for procurement in the upcoming year. Eric Hardter, PhD, RAC (US, CAN, EU) and colleagues from The Emmes Company have provided the Panel with the following study summary of activities for human research entitled \"A Randomized, Double-Blind, Support-of-Concept Phase 2 Study of Single-Dose Psilocybin for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).\" 7 A. Summary of Activities Protocol PSIL201 is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, multi-site study evaluating the use of psilocybin (or placebo) along with conjunctive \"set and setting\" context and post-dose integration sessions in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The study intends to recruit 80 adult participants (ages 21-65) with documented major depressive disorder who do not show an unacceptably large degree of symptom improvement between Screening and Baseline for a 1:1 randomization to either psilocybin or placebo (niacin). Participants will remain enrolled for approximately six weeks and will be followed for depressive symptoms, clinical global functioning, functional disability, anxiety symptoms and health-related quality of life. The primary objective of the PSIL201 study is to evaluate the potential effcacy of a single 25 mg oral dose of psilocybin for major depressive disorder compared to placebo in otherwise medically healthy participants, as assessed by the difference between groups in changes in depressive symptoms from Baseline to Day eight post-dose. Since study inception and prior to the end of the reporting period, 16 participants have been randomized across seven study sites. One California site, the University of California San Francisco, opened to recruitment but has not yet randomized any participants. Global study recruitment was paused for two months in March and April 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and sites re-opened when able in accordance with applicable local/ institutional requirements. There have been no new fndings relative to the study objectives and endpoints since inception, and no publications regarding trial progress are available. No serious adverse events (SAEs) have been reported by participants randomized to either psilocybin or placebo. B. Research Plan for 2021 Participant enrollment and follow-up is ongoing at all sites, and is expected to continue throughout 2021. Additionally, a second site, Pacifc Neuroscience Institute in Santa Monica, is currently in activation status and will begin to enroll participants in 2021. Kim Janda, PhD of The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA has provided the following summary and fndings regarding the research entitled \"Vaccine Research (Vaccines and Antidotes Against Drugs of Abuse).\" A. Specifc Aims The overarching goal of our research involving Schedule I and Schedule II controlled substances is geared towards the development and optimization of \"vaccines\" that could be used to diminish or block the negative consequences resulting from the potential abuse of and/or addiction to these \"drugs.\" During this and previous years we have focused on abused drugs like cocaine, methamphetamine, opioids and their synthetic counterparts (heroin, morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl, carfentanil, isotonitazene, etonitazene), and most recently on made and sold \"street drugs\" like the synthetic cannabinoids. 8 B. Summary of Research Performed and Findings In general, most of the controlled substances used in research during 2020 were used in various stages along the progression towards developing \"vaccines\" that might create an immune response in an animal model leading to circulating antibodies that could bind to and/or eliminate circulating drugs of abuse and prevent drug passage across the blood-brain barrier. The research \"progression\" often includes: organic chemical synthesis of a drug-like hapten; linking that hapten to some immunogenic carrier protein; injecting that conjugate into a rodent; harvesting blood after a response time to do ELISA titer tests for antibody binding to the drug; doing further SPR/Biacore binding studies on the best antibody candidates; and, ultimately, testing \"vaccines\" in animals again to check for protection from drug challenges or reduction in addictive behavior. C. Highlights from the published research 1. Production of an anti-fentanyl vaccine developed using a unique double conjugation strategy to enhance the immune response exploiting the opsonization effect. 2. Development of new anti-heroin vaccines generated using sulfonates as carboxylate isosteres within the original hapten design. 3. The improvement of an anti-heroin vaccine's effcacy through the use of regioselective hapten deuteration 4. A study to evaluate the effectiveness of a dual heroin/fentanyl vaccine through review of two measurable behavioral responses in rats. 5. Further evaluation of a dual heroin/fentanyl vaccine against exposure to heroin contaminated with fentanyl. 6. A review of the status of research aimed at addressing the development of vaccines against methamphetamine abuse. 7. A study of how an anti-fentanyl vaccine altered fentanyl self-administration and fentanyl vs. food choice in monkeys. 8. The development of new opioid (heroin and fentanyl) vaccine formulations and storage techniques toward a clinically viable treatment. 9. The initial development of hapten screening systems and admixture vaccines against synthetic cannabinoids with effcacy studies including behavioral analysis and a drug inhalation (vaping) scenario in mice. D. Research Plans for the Upcoming Calendar Year The research plans for the coming year will be a continuation of much of the work done in 2020. There may be a heavier emphasis on immunotherapy to counteract lethal doses of carfentanil as well as process development, manufacturing, and pre-clinical evaluation of a monoclonal antibody for fentanyl overdose. 9 Stephen Canning and Alkermes, Inc. have provided the Panel with the following summary of multicenter clinical drug trial research performed with ALKS 3831 and the fndings made between January 2020 and December 2020 for research entitled \"A Study to Evaluate the Effect of ALKS 3831 Compared to Olanzapine on Body Weight in Young Adults with Schizophrenia, Schizophreniform or Bipolar I Disorder Who are Early in Their Illness.\" A. Overview ALKS 3831 is composed of two active substances: olanzapine and samidorphan. It is under investigation for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder. Olanzapine is FDA-approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder and is not a controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). Samidorphan is a new molecular entity, 17-(cyclopropylmethyl)-4, 14-dihydroxy-6-oxo-morphinan-3-carboxamide (CAS No. 852626-86-2). Samidorphan was classifed as a Schedule II substance by DEA under the Controlled Substances Act (\"CSA\") (CSCN 9668) because it is derived from opium alkaloids. Samidorphan is a -opioid receptor antagonist. The mechanism of action could be mediated through opioid receptor antagonism. To date, over 1800 subjects have been exposed to ALKS 3831. [Note from Panel: As of April 19, 2021, samidorphan has been removed from DEA scheduling (Federal Register/Vol.86, No.73/Monday, April 19, 2021) after scientifc and medical evaluation of clinical trial data. This proposed rule is supported by eight factor analyses evaluating the abuse potential of samidorphan conducted by the DEA and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)]. This Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study is to evaluate the effect of ALKS 3831 compared to olanzapine on body weight in young adults with schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or bipolar I disorder who are early in their illness. Subjects are screened at Visit 1, up to 30 days prior to randomization. At Visit 2, eligible subjects are randomized (1:1) to ALKS 3831 or olanzapine and receive study drug for up to 12 weeks. This study was ongoing during the reporting period. Of the sites within the United States, four are located in California. The study enrolled 169 subjects during the reporting period, two of whom participated at sites located in California. Enrollment for this study is ongoing, and the last patient is estimated to complete fourth quarter, 2021. Due to the blinded nature of the study, no effcacy results are available as of the date of this report. No serious adverse reactions (SARs) were reported during the reporting period. Ongoing monitoring of safety and tolerability will continue through the end of the study. 10 TABLE 1 RESEARCH STUDIES APPROVED IN 2019 AND 2020 Alkermes, Inc. | Waltham, MA A Phase 3b Extension Study of Adjunctive ALKS 5461 in the Treatment of Refractory Major Depressive Disorder (ALK5461-218) Stephan Anagnostaras, PhD | UC San Diego | La Jolla, CA MDMA and Memory, Addiction, Social Behavior, Anxiety, and Depression: A Dose-Effect Analysis Andy Barron | CRO: Worldwide Clinical Trials Ltd. | Morrisville, NC The Safety and Effcacy of Psilocybin as an Augmentation Therapy in Participants with Treatment Resistant Depression (COMP 003) Ryan Baxter, PhD | UC Merced | Merced, CA Cannabinoid Isolation, Purifcation, and Structure Diversifcation Devin K.
