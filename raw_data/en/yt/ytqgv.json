Spiritual Healing: These healing sessions can help you let go of causes of suffering, including fear, anxiety, worry, doubt, anger, grief, insecurity, guilt, shame, and attachment. As the causes of suffering dissolve, more joy, peace and empowerment can become available to you. This allows your physical body to have a stronger connection to the Divine Healing that already exists within you. Because emotional disturbances often cause physical pain and disease, it's possible our work together also helps you find relief from physical symptoms. This work is often planetary and/or chakra-based. Chakras are energy centers that correspond directly with the nervous system. Planetary energies, as indicated in your astrological birth chart, can show how you think and process emotions. Cari might consult your astrological birth chart to see what planetary influences she can work with to help shift energy. Just as the birth chart can indicate challenges, experiences from this lifetime, other lifetimes or ancestry can also impact the flow of energy and create \"grooves\" or conditioned patterning. These sessions can help reset energy flow, strengthen connection to your Higher Guidance and shift old habitual thoughts and reactions. Cari works completely with energy. No touching, herbs or crystals are necessary. Sessions are via phone or at [The Greenbrier](https://www.greenbrier.com/Spa/Group-Meditation.aspx) for an additional fee. Her work comes from higher states of Consciousness and are therefore, not subject to our human understanding of time and physical world reality. Not diagnostic. Yoga: The ultimate goal of each practice is Self-realization and complete union with the Divine. Basic yoga postures and dynamic rhythmic movements are used to help you feel a greater sense of inner peace and calm. The focus is on enhancing mindfulness, flow, and clear perceptual awareness. This may result in relieving physical pain and limitations. It's intuitively guided based on what's going on with you emotionally, physically, and energetically. Not achievement- or fitness-based. Kundalini Yoga: Kundalini Yoga is called the \"Yoga of Awareness.\" It's a powerful combination of meditation, sound (chanting), breathing techniques, postures and dynamic movement to help you release stress. It can also shift old patterning so you can see things as they truly are and not through the illusory lens of past wounds, anxiety or fear. These classes often begin with a Vinyasa or flow-based warm-up. All levels. Meditation: Connect to your inner wisdom for emotional and physical healing support. You'll be guided in a customized practice specific to your needs. You don't have to be able to sit on the floor. Breathing techniques (pranayama) and chanting (mantra) may be used to support you. Classical Yoga Nidra: Yoga Nidra is a state of Consciousness. Progressive guided relaxation and energy healing are used simultaneously to help you experience more bliss. This practice can also help you evolve beyond your karma so that you can experience improved health. "}
