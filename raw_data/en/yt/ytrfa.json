Rudolph and Antoinette Roesler de Villiers founded LLS in 1949 after losing their 16-year-old son Robbie to leukemia. Determined to spare other families the devastating loss of a child, the de Villiers set out to transform cancer treatment and care. As an organization founded by a family for families, our vision is rooted firmly in the de Villiers' relentless drive to create a world without blood cancer. Since our founding, generations of patients, survivors, caregivers, families, volunteers, researchers, healthcare professionals and supporters have joined our quest for cancer cures. In 2019, LLS celebrated our 70th anniversary by looking to inspiration of the past to propel us forward. To mark the occasion, we invited our global community to help us grow a digital family tree on www.LLS.org by sharing stories of impact. Stories like that of Dr. James Holland, who was a trailblazing researcher. In 1955, LLS awarded a grant to Dr. Holland, whose discovery helped establish the first standard of care for children with leukemia. Today, this story resonates even more in light of our recent launch of The LLS Children's Initiative, a $100 million comprehensive endeavor to deliver cures and better care to children with cancer. Here at LLS, beating cancer is in our blood. Over the past 70 years, we have invested nearly $1.3 billion in cutting edge research worldwide, fueling virtually every critical advancement in blood cancer treatment, including pioneering chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell immunotherapies that supercharge patients' own immune cells to attack cancer. Many of these groundbreaking treatment approaches, first discovered in blood cancer, are now being tested in clinical trials for other cancers and diseases, such as breast, lung, pancreatic and prostate cancer. We believe there is no one way to beat cancer. The future of cancer treatment hinges on giving the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. LLS is bringing the promise of precision medicine and immunotherapy to more patients in urgent need across every aspect of our mission work. At the same time, we are relentless about helping patients, caregivers and families throughout their entire cancer experience to ensure they have access to care. LLS is the leading source of free blood cancer information, education and support for patients, survivors, caregivers, families and healthcare professionals. And through our nationwide CELEBRATING 70 YEARS A Letter from our Leadership ANNUAL REPORT 2019 3 \" Everyone is supposed to fulfill a certain purpose in life; Robbie's seems to have been to make others happy with his joyful, inspiring nature, his wit and knowledge, and as young as he was\u2014in fact hardly more than a child\u2014 to earn the right not to be forgotten.\" \u2014 Rudolph Roesler de Villiers grassroots network of more than 50,000 active online volunteers, we drive lifesaving policies that accelerate the development of new cancer treatments and break down barriers to care. While we've made incredible progress, blood cancers are the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.\u2014a sobering reminder that we have more work to do. We need to change fundamentally how children with cancer are treated. We need to advance new and efficient clinical trial models to deliver more breakthroughs, and importantly, we need to help patients access these trials. And we need to take bold action for patients against the staggering cost of cancer care. Every facet of our mission is working in harmony to put patients first and address these priorities. As a global leader in the fight to end cancer, with your support, we press on with unwavering dedication. Gratefully, Louis J. DeGennaro, PhD President and Chief Executive OfficerJorge Benitez Chair of the Board ANNUAL REPORT 20194SPOTLIGHTING OUR IMPACT Our work has helped millions impacted by cancer. Since the 1960s, survival rates for many blood cancer patients have doubled, tripled or even quadrupled. What's more, we've seen an average decline of 32 percent in blood cancer death rates since the 1990s. That's the power of the LLS mission. By funding pioneering cancer research to advance treatments and cures and helping patients and families access the care they need, we are saving and improving the lives of patients and giving hope to countless families across the globe. But we won't stop until we achieve a world without blood cancer. \" Thanks to LLS, a new treatment was available each time I relapsed, and those new treatments provided hope for my family and me.\" \u2014 Peter Pearson, a three-time cancer survivor first diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in 2013 Peter participated in a clinical trial for a targeted therapy called brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris\u00ae), which LLS-funded research helped advance. In 2018, the FDA approved this therapy in combination with chemotherapy to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced Hodgkin lymphoma, representing the first change in the standard of care for the disease in 40 years. Today, Peter and his family raise funds for LLS through Big Climb, Light The Night and Pennies for Patients.

Blood cancers \u2014which consist of more than 100 different types of diseases\u2014are complex, but we're cracking the code, thanks to new genomic technologies. Equipped with powerful molecular methods and a deeper understanding of our genetic blueprint, we're learning more about what causes blood cancer and why certain therapies work and why some fail. WHAT'S THE LATEST IN BLOOD CANCER RESEARCH? Lee Greenberger, PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at LLS , shares what key trends mean for patients.LLS HELPED ADVANCE 46 OF THE 53 BLOOD CANCER TREATMENT OPTIONS APPROVED BY THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) SINCE 2017. IN ADDITION TO OUR BEAT AML MASTER CLINICAL TRIAL, LLS SUPPORTED MORE THAN 240 CUTTING EDGE RESEARCH GRANTS AND 22 THERAPY ACCELERATION PROGRAM (TAP) PARTNERSHIPS WORLDWIDE.

THANKS TO OUR INCREDIBLE SUPPORTERS, WE ACHIEVED OUR $125 MILLION FUNDRAISING GOAL FOR OUR COMPREHENSIVE EFFORTS TO BEAT ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA (AML). ANNUAL REPORT 2019 2. Precision medicine is on the rise. Chemotherapies destroy cancer cells, but also damage normal cells, causing substantial side effects. Today, more recently approved oral targeted therapies attack blood cancer cells specifically, while sparing healthy cells with impressive results. For example, the FDA-approved combination of venetoclax (Venclexta\u00ae) and obinutuzumab (Gazyva\u00ae) marks a new chemotherapy-free, front-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. LLS has supported research advancing venetoclax for the past 15 years. Venetoclax, when used in combination with conventional chemotherapy, is also a game changer for AML . 3. The golden age of immunotherapy continues. LLS is advancing different approaches that activate the immune system to fight cancer, including CAR T-cell immunotherapies and cancer vaccines. We're exploring every avenue to improve CAR T-cell therapy so that more patients with blood cancer achieve long-lasting disease control. 4. Prevention is the new frontier. Advances in genomics are allowing us to identify individuals who are at a higher risk of developing blood cancer years before it might occur with the use of a blood test. Researchers are also exploring how to prevent early precursor diseases from progressing to more serious blood cancers.8 \" I stand in defiance against childhood cancer. Losing my son Zach was unimaginably devastating, but his struggle makes me all the more relentless about accelerating better treatments and care, so we can save the lives of more children and spare others from life-altering, long-term side effects.\" \u2014 Julie Guillot, Volunteer Chair, Pediatric Partnerships and Outreach at LLS BY THE NUMBERSAPPROXIMATEL Y 80% OF CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS DEVELOP ONE OR MORE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS AS A RESULT OF TREATMENTIN THE LAST 40 YEARS, ONLY 4 ONCOLOGY DRUGS HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR FIRST USE IN CHILDRENANNUAL REPORT 2019 9 Taking on Children's Cancer from Every Direction Fighting for Children with Cancer Julie Guillot never imagined the harrowing struggle that would follow after her eldest son, Zach, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at the age of 5. For four years, Zach endured brutal chemotherapy, radiation, fevers, unyielding nausea and months confined to three different hospitals. A fan of superheroes, he faced the daunting regimen with bravery. But the intensity of his treatments took a tremendous toll. Sadly, Zach passed away after his third bone marrow transplant. \"I won't stop fighting for Zach. I am determined to do as much as I can so other families don't have to go down this terrible path,\" says Julie. Today, Julie is an influential parent advocate and LLS volunteer who is dedicated to speeding safer, more curative therapies for children. Delivering Cures and Better Care For many childhood cancers, chemotherapies developed decades ago remain the standard of care and simply don't work well enough. Too many children succumb to their cancer. Survival rates for high-risk forms of blood cancer, such as AML, are especially poor. For those who do survive, the long-term effects of treatment can cause life-threatening complications and secondary illnesses and cancers. LLS is disrupting the status quo with our bold vision: we want children not only to survive cancer, but thrive in their lives after treatment. That's why we launched The LLS Children's Initiative: Cures and Care for Children with Cancer , a full-scale, multi-year endeavor to take on children's cancer from every direction. \" Every young life lost to cancer is one too many. We must do better. With The LLS Children's Initiative, we will,\" says Gwen Nichols, MD, LLS Chief Medical Officer. ABOUT 40% OF PEDIATRIC CANCERS ARE BLOOD CANCERS10 Taking on Children's Cancer from Every Direction (cont.) Overcoming Obstacles to Progress For too long, children have been treated with a one-size-fits-all approach, despite cancer behaving differently in children than in adults. \"Children are not little adults; they need therapies that are designed just for them,\" says Dr. Nichols. But given the relatively small patient population, there has not been enough incentive for the private sector to pursue pediatric drug development. Beyond research, there are regulatory hurdles and access issues, including financial and geographic barriers, which stand between patients and the care they need. Only LLS has the proven track record, leadership and visionary supporters needed to usher in a new era of pediatric cancer treatment and care. Our goal is to revolutionize the standard of care for children with cancer, providing them with safer, more effective treatments that rely less on chemotherapies that harm healthy cells in the body. When a child is diagnosed with cancer, it affects the entire family. The support we received from the two LLS programs helped us focus on taking care of King and made us feel less alone in our journey. King has been dealing with cancer for most of his young life, and has a long road ahead of him still. But we are hopeful that with LLS leading the charge, more children will survive cancer and thrive in their lives after treatment. \" \u2014 Shameeza Singh , King's mother King was diagnosed with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in June 2016 at the age of 2. His treatment plan included three and a half years of daily chemotherapy. He took 75 pills per month, in addition to intravenous and spinal chemotherapy. During this time, he experienced severe complications, including brain swelling, nerve damage, painful mouth sores and more. His family received support from LLS through our Urgent Need Program and Patient Aid Program. In October 2019, King completed chemotherapy, but continues to battle the chronic side effects from his treatment and a lifelong genetic disorder called G6PD deficiency. King and his family spend their time advocating and spreading awareness about pediatric cancer.

The LLS Children's Initiative will bring precision medicine to children with cancer and ensure they have access to care. Driving New Breakthroughs Faster LLS is more than doubling our investment in pediatric cancer research grants worldwide. Our areas of focus include: Harnessing the immune system to fight cancer Identifying biomarkers to understand which patients will respond to certain therapies Overcoming treatment resistance Improving detection of cancer cells left after treatment that can lead to relapse Mitigating long-term treatment effects, such as cardiotoxicity and infertility Further, LLS has undertaken an unprecedented collaboration to launch the first global precision medicine clinical trial for pediatric acute leukemia, called LLS PedAL. Building upon our successful Beat AML\u00ae Master Clinical Trial, LLS will unite physicians, scientists, regulators, advocacy organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and others to change the paradigm of treatment through a precision medicine approach that puts pediatric patients first. Together, we will create a single set of pediatric cancer data that will be made available to researchers worldwide, identify and validate underlying molecular drivers of disease, and match patients with relapsed acute leukemia to the most promising treatments based on their unique tumor biology. The goal is to test multiple targeted therapies simultaneously at up to 200 clinical sites worldwide, with an anticipated opening in 2020. Ensuring Access to the Best Care Possible Because new breakthroughs are beneficial only if patients can access them, we are expanding our trusted education and support services\u2014including resources for children and young adults with cancer and financial assistance programs\u2014to help more patients, parents and caregivers navigate cancer treatments and access quality care. LLS is dedicated to helping children and families cope with the financial, emotional and psychological impact of a cancer diagnosis through our comprehensive array of free information, education and support. Meanwhile, our policy and advocacy efforts focus on breaking down barriers to care and accelerating the development of new cancer treatments. LLS is co-chairing the Policy Committee of the Alliance for Childhood Cancer, a coalition of more than 25 advocacy groups and professional organizations. Through our work with the coalition, we played an instrumental role in the enactment of The Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Treatment, Access and Research (STAR) Act, the most comprehensive federal childhood cancer legislation ever introduced. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 13 Myrrah, leukemia survivor14 \" I was inspired by past LLS Career Development Program awardees, many of whom are now leaders in the field. This award from LLS provides a tremendous boost to our research.\" \u2014 G. Greg Wang, PhD, University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Dr. Wang is using a cutting edge gene-editing tool called CRISPR, combined with genetic profiling, to understand how a particular mutation called DNMT3A leads to the development of AML. With these insights, researchers can develop innovative new treatment strategies. ANNUAL REPORT 2019 15 Accelerating Cures Leading the Way to Cures Our growing understanding of the genetic underpinnings of blood cancer is breaking new ground in cancer treatment and care. By supporting the full spectrum of research, from basic, laboratory-based science to large- scale clinical trials, LLS is at the forefront of the fight to cure cancer. At the same time, we're working tirelessly to ensure that treatment advances reach blood cancer patients. LLS is redoubling efforts to connect patients to clinical trials, which are critical avenues to improving access to care and discovering breakthroughs. Further, our Office of Public Policy works to increase research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal agencies, accelerate FDA approval processes while still protecting patient safety, and promote patient-focused drug development that prioritizes patients' needs and concerns. Investing in Pioneering Research LLS is the largest nonprofit funder of blood cancer research. In 2019, we dedicated $47.4 million to support scientific grants, including 106 new grants awarded to researchers across the globe. With more than 35 new Career Development Program grants, we continue to bolster the early careers of scientists. Our support of promising young scientists has produced three Nobel Prize winners, more than 15 National Academy of Sciences members and more than 10 department chairs of major cancer centers. LLS invested $7 million of our 2019 research budget in our Therapy Acceleration Program\u00ae (TAP), a venture philanthropy model through which we partner with biotech and academic institutions to advance promising novel therapies. New TAP partners include industry leaders such as Forty Seven, Inc., Sutro Biopharma, X4 Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Verastem Oncology. Since 2017, three TAP-supported treatments were approved by the FDA. Collaborating for Cures LLS is driving innovative multi-year partnerships to maximize our research investment, including: A $1.8 million partnership with the Snowdome Foundation and Australia's Leukaemia Foundation to support leading blood cancer research projects in Australia A $6.75 million collaboration between LLS, The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research and The Paul G. Allen Frontiers Group to boost critical discovery research by seasoned investigators A $4 million partnership with the Rising Tide Foundation for Clinical Cancer Research (RTFCCR) to accelerate global immunotherapy and prevention research A $1.5 million partnership with the RUNX1 Foundation to advance better treatments for RUNX1 familial platelet \u00a9UNC Health Care16 20-year investment in CAR T-cell immunotherapy has paid off with two approved treatments for children and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adults with certain highly lethal lymphomas who have exhausted all other treatment options. Remarkably, many patients remain free of disease years after a single CAR T-cell dose. Today, we are funding the next generation of this game changing approach : Helen Heslop, MD, Baylor College of Medicine, is driving new immunotherapies for leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Her visionary team is maximizing approved CAR T-cell immunotherapies and developing \"off the shelf\" CAR-Ts that use cells from donors instead of patients to reduce production time. Jianhua Yu, PhD, City of Hope , is combining CAR-T and bispecific antibodies, two living drugs that launch persistent immune responses against cancer cells, to treat myeloma. Based on the success in blood cancer, researchers are investigating applications in solid tumors, including lung, breast, colon and prostate cancer. Outsmarting Cancer with Precision Medicine LLS is unifying goals among science, industry, cancer centers, regulators, philanthropists and patients to revolutionize cancer treatment through precision medicine. Our Beat AML Master Clinical Trial is a case in point. Launched in 2016, the Beat AML Master Clinical Trial is the first collaborative precision medicine clinical trial in a blood cancer. The trial uses advanced genomic technology to identify each AML patient's cancer-driving genetic mutations, and then matches patients to the most promising targeted treatment within a rapid timeframe. More than 760 patients have been screened in 11 study arms at 16 cancer centers across the country. Other highlights include: Robert Orlowski, MD, PhD, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and his colleagues are studying the unique molecular features of patients with myeloma precursor diseases, so treatment can be tailored to prevent progression to full-blown myeloma. Ari Melnick, MD, Weill Cornell Medicine , is advancing novel therapies for B-cell lymphomas that target specific epigenetic mechanisms, the switches that turn genes on or off and control cell behavior. Craig Jordan, PhD, University of Colorado , is leading a world-class team of researchers to eradicate cancer stem cells\u2014the roots of disease\u2014in patients with AML through personalized approaches. This work is supported by a matching fund from the University of Colorado Medical Center. Accelerating Cures (cont.) \u00a9HealthCentral\" LLS's early and sustained research investment in CAR T-cell immunotherapy is the reason I am here today and able to cherish every moment with my daughter.\" \u2014 Chuck Colletti, diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2016 This year, Chuck fundraised proudly for LLS through our Man & Woman of the Year campaign. \u00a9HealthCentral18 Driving Clinical Trial Innovation, Education and Enrollment Understanding the Value of Clinical Trials Without sufficient enrollment in clinical trials, new treatments cannot be approved, scientific knowledge stalls and patients cannot access potentially lifesaving therapies. But the landscape is complex and evolving rapidly. Patients and caregivers are often left to search for trials on their own, leaving them with more questions than answers. The process can be cumbersome for healthcare professionals, too. Clinical research in the era of precision medicine is homing in on smaller groups of patients with specific disease subtypes or characteristics. Too many trials fail to meet their goals because there are not enough patients enrolled. Clinical trials are not \"last resort\" options, but rather avenues to leading edge care. LLS is committed to connecting patients to clinical trials, funding groundbreaking clinical science and advocating for policies that put patients at the center of their care. Improving Access and Participation LLS continues to expand our Clinical Trial Support Center (CTSC), in which Clinical Trial Nurse Navigators\u2014registered nurses with expertise in blood cancers\u2014conduct comprehensive clinical trial searches and assist patients and caregivers throughout the entire clinical trial enrollment process. Together, LLS Clinical Trial Nurse Navigators and LLS Information Specialists\u2014master's level oncology professionals\u2014work one-on-one with blood cancer patients and caregivers to help them become more active participants in their care and overcome barriers to enrolling in trials, including assistance with finances and lodging. On average, it takes more than 30 interactions with a patient, their caregivers and healthcare professionals to help a patient enroll in a clinical trial. This year, LLS Clinical Trial Nurse Navigators had nearly 8,000 interactions with patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals, demonstrating the depth and breadth of our support. With only about 5 percent of all adult cancer patients in the U.S. enrolling in clinical trials, LLS is helping to bridge this enrollment gap with our free, personalized clinical trial navigation for blood cancer patients and their families. Typically, 22 percent of patients who are assisted by the CTSC enroll in an appropriate clinical trial, showing the power of our in-depth support on the lives of patients.ANNUAL REPORT 2019 19 \" I was on a mission to stay alive.

Videos Podcasts Information booklets Continuing Education/ Continuing Medical Education programs 20 ANNUAL REPORT 2019 21Looking Forward Beginning in 2020, LLS will expand a dynamic collaboration with the American Society of Hematology (ASH) to provide more than 2,500 ASH member physicians in the U.S. and Canada with dedicated access to the CTSC, making it easier to refer patients to our personalized support. This collaboration builds upon a successful pilot program completed in 2018, which found that the CTSC helped physicians have informed discussions with their patients about clinical trials as a possible course of treatment. LLS is also working to expand clinical trial access among blood cancer patients in underserved communities. Through our new research program, Impactful Medicine Providing Access to Clinical Trials (IMPACT), we aim to bring innovative clinical trials to patients served by community cancer centers, especially in rural or economically disadvantaged areas. By fostering partnerships between community-based oncologists and clinical trial leaders at major cancer centers, IMPACT will help patients access clinical trials in their communities and educate local physicians about advances in genomics and precision medicine. The goal of each IMPACT grant is to increase clinical trial participation among blood cancer patients served by community cancer centers by at least 20 percent over a five-year period. Pioneering New Models LLS funds research from bench to bedside through collaborations, venture philanthropy and grants. This year, we invested $32 million of our research budget to support clinical trials, along with an additional $10.5 million to operate our Beat AML Master Clinical Trial, for a total investment of $42.5 million. Complementing our research agenda are policy and advocacy efforts that push for affordable clinical trial access and hold the FDA accountable for implementing clinical trial reforms enacted in the 21st Century Cures Act, including new rules on master trials. LLS champions these pioneering models. Our Beat AML Master Clinical Trial demonstrates that personalized treatment using genomics can be assigned to patients based on their specific subtype in less than seven days. With its flexible, collaborative structure, the trial is testing several novel therapies in multiple study arms simultaneously. This patient-first trial design\u2014developed with guidance from the FDA\u2014has the potential to stand as a model for future cancer clinical trials. Now, LLS will bring our leadership in patient-centric clinical trials to pediatric acute leukemia and other blood cancers. We will also continue to ensure that patients' needs and preferences are at the forefront of drug development to pave the way for better care and cures in the future.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 23 Helping Patients Throughout Their Cancer Experience Approximately every three minutes, someone in the U.S. is diagnosed with a blood cancer. When someone experiences the fear and uncertainty of a cancer diagnosis, we provide hope, guidance, education and support. LLS is dedicated to helping patients navigate their cancer treatments and access quality care. Supporting Patients, Caregivers and Families We are committed to patients, caregivers and families throughout their entire cancer experience. Here at LLS, we believe one-on-one support makes all the difference, so we offer a wide array of free resources to help patients find the support they need. For more than two decades, LLS Information Specialists have been on the front lines of an ever-changing healthcare landscape, guiding patients and caregivers to our robust education and support services. Information Specialists are master's level oncology professionals who provide free, personalized assistance to patients, families and healthcare providers. They offer guidance through cancer treatment, assist with financial and social challenges, and give accurate, up-to-date disease, treatment and support information. Information Specialists also refer patients to LLS Clinical Trial Nurse Navigators as appropriate. According to an independent evaluation that concluded in 2019, 86 percent of patients and caregivers said they felt more hopeful and 83 percent said they felt more comfortable managing their or their loved one's diagnosis after their first contact with an Information Specialist. This is an extraordinary testament to the impact of LLS's one-on-one support. We offer a variety of ways for patients and caregivers to find connections and support. This year, LLS: Connected more than 1,500 volunteers with patients and caregivers diagnosed with the same disease through LLS's Patti Robinson Kaufmann First Connection Program Reached nearly 12,000 patients and caregivers registered on our online social network, LLS Patient Community Provided nearly 900 patients and caregivers with free, personalized nutrition consultations from our registered dietitian Distributed a new, comprehensive caregiver workbook in English and Spanish to 930 caregivers Contact an Information Specialist for one-on-one support at 1.800.955.4572 , and by live chat or email via www.LLS.org.24 \" Volunteering with Myeloma Link gave me a way to heal from my cancer experience, while helping someone else in the process.

ANNUAL REPORT 2019 25 Helping Patients Throughout Their Cancer Experience (cont.) Educating Patients, Caregivers and Healthcare Professionals LLS is here to help patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals stay informed and current on the latest disease, treatment and survivorship information. This year, LLS: Distributed more than 855,000 educational booklets and fact sheets about blood cancers and survivorship topics Educated more than 132,400 patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals and others through live web-based and local in-person programs Reached nearly 12,000 listeners through LLS podcasts, including The Bloodline with LLS for patients and caregivers, and Treating Blood Cancers , a new podcast for healthcare professionals Investing in Health Services Research LLS plans to boost our investment in health services research to understand and address concerns about quality of life and access to care during treatment and beyond. LLS is pursuing research into: The financial burden of treatment The services survivors or caregivers might need The preferences patients have when weighing treatment options The late effects survivors might be experiencing This year, LLS received a three-year grant to fund a new intervention study by Carma Bylund, PhD, University of Florida, and her research team that aims to improve family and healthcare communication among adults who care for a parent with blood cancer. This work builds upon in-depth qualitative research completed by Dr. Bylund and LLS in 2018, which identified unique communication issues faced by these caregivers, including conflicts with siblings in negotiating caregiving responsibilities and navigating role reversals. As part of the intervention study, new online resources will launch on www.LLS.org in the next year to help caregivers of parents practice open, healthy communication with their families, find reliable cancer information online and communicate effectively with healthcare teams. Both research studies were funded by the Carolan Research Institute. SPOTLIGHT ON MYELOMA LINK African Americans have twice the incidence of myeloma as white Americans. Recent studies show that African Americans are significantly less likely to receive the latest treatments, and are more likely to experience treatment delays. LLS is dedicated to connecting African American communities to free myeloma information and support and enhancing access to care and the latest treatments through our Myeloma Link program. In 2019, the program expanded from two to eight cities, reaching more than 10,000 patients, caregivers and healthcare providers through over 100 awareness and education programs. Myeloma Link is just one part of our efforts to address the needs of underserved communities. LLS has committed $35.4 million in multi-year grants to accelerate impactful myeloma research to find cures. 26LLS invests in research critical to achieving cancer treatment breakthroughs, which often requires decades of effort and financial support. While LLS is advancing efficient clinical trial designs and cost effective ways to produce groundbreaking treatments, we need to take action now to ensure that cancer patients can access lifesaving treatments. Taking Bold Action for Patients With the cost of cancer care skyrocketing, a growing portion of these costs is being shifted to patients. As a result, some patients are delaying or even forgoing treatment. Through our nationwide grassroots network of more than 50,000 active online volunteers, LLS works to break down barriers standing between patients and the care they need. In 2017, LLS launched our Cost of Cancer Care Initiative with aggressive, yet feasible cost-cutting ideas that would save money without sacrificing quality care. We shared our ideas with stakeholders across the healthcare ecosystem because we believe all players need to do their part to put patients first. Since then, our Office of Public Policy has made significant progress on many fronts, including helping to advance reforms that level the playing field for lower- cost biosimilar versions of costly drugs. This year, we continued the momentum by putting forward 31 policy recommendations in March. Breaking Down Barriers to Care Six months later, we saw progress on 75 percent of these recommendations, including: Bi-partisan support for proposals to lower out- of-pocket costs, especially for those enrolled in Medicare Part D Measures under consideration to promote value- based payments, so that the cost of service reflects its value Measures adopted to increase marketplace competition, such as allowing generic drugmakers to introduce less expensive versions of costly drugs sooner LLS also advocates for meaningful health insurance coverage, so that patients can afford the treatments they need. We advance solutions that uphold our core principles for meaningful coverage: guarantee access, promote affordability, ensure quality and encourage stability. In particular, LLS calls upon lawmakers to limit the spread of short-term, limited duration health insurance plans, which pose risks to patients and consumers by requiring them to pay exorbitant costs. We pushed back against these plans through multifaceted efforts, urging members of Congress, governors, state legislators and insurance commissioners to take action to protect patients.

The $500 [from the LLS Urgent Need Program] helped with our rent. \" Your program has been a saving grace for my parents. They planned for retirement and would have had everything wiped out had it not been for your service. While we fight the rising cost of cancer care through our policy and advocacy endeavors, we know patients and caregivers need help now. We provide an array of financial assistance programs to help with cancer-related expenses. Making a Difference Through our financial assistance programs, we help patients and families navigate difficulties with insurance and co-pay burdens and cope with the often daunting financial challenges of cancer treatment. This year, LLS expanded the financial support we provide through two new programs to help blood cancer patients and their families when they need it most. The LLS Urgent Need Program , established in partnership with \"Moppie's Love,\" is available to help pediatric and young adult blood cancer patients, or adult blood cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials, who are in acute financial need. The program provides a $500 grant to assist with non-medical expenses, including utilities, rent, mortgage, food, lodging, dental care, child care, elder care and other essential needs. The LLS Patient Aid Program provides financial assistance to blood cancer patients, regardless of their financial circumstances. Eligible patients receive a $100 stipend. What patients and families are saying:ANNUAL REPORT 2019 29 Uncovering New Insights Here at LLS, we believe no one should have to choose between seeking care and affording groceries or a mortgage. The cost of cancer care is becoming unsustainable for both cancer patients and the overall healthcare system. LLS is investing in more research to understand the financial burdens associated with the cost of blood cancer treatment and its long-term effects, as well as disparities in patients' access to the latest treatments. Leading edge LLS-funded research projects include: Rena Conti, PhD, Associate Research Director of Biopharma & Public Policy at the Boston University Institute for Health System Innovation & Policy , is leading a study to understand better the range of financial difficulties experienced by patients with multiple myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are undergoing or have forgone treatment at National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) Minority/Underserved Community Sites across the country. Dr. Conti is also a Dean's Research Scholar and Associate Professor of Markets, Public Policy and Law at the Boston University Questrom School of Business. Stacie Dusetzina, PhD, Associate Professor of Health Policy and Ingram Associate Professor of Cancer Research at Vanderbilt , is leading a two-year study jointly funded by LLS and The Commonwealth Fund on the impact of healthcare costs on the behavior of senior patients enrolled in Medicare. Her research is examining the association between delaying or never filling specialty drug prescriptions and health outcomes related to the disease being treated. In addition, we commissioned two studies by the actuarial firm, Milliman, examining the factors that are driving blood cancer costs within the healthcare system as well as the out-of-pocket cost burden that patients experience. The findings showed, for example, that treatment of acute leukemia among commercially insured patients cost the healthcare system more than $800,000 on average in the first three years following a patient's diagnosis. For patients with Medicare coverage, those being treated for lymphoma spent as much as $19,000 out-of-pocket on medical costs in the first year following their diagnosis, while those with myeloma spent $24,000 on average in the first two years following diagnosis. These extraordinary costs underscore the simple fact that meaningful insurance coverage is a necessity for virtually anyone in need of blood cancer treatment. The high cost of care is also a reminder that as we make advancements in the treatment of blood cancer, we must pursue policies that ensure those treatments are accessible to the patients who need them.

LLS provided the information I requested and put me in touch with my local chapter. That was the beginning of a long and wonderful relationship. Wanting to give back to LLS, I became a volunteer and later Trustee for the chapter and formed a Family & Friends team to participate in the annual Light The Night walk. My brother and sister-in-law, Steve and Maddy, have been incredibly generous over the years with their own philanthropy to LLS. We want our help to continue after us, so both Paul and I have named LLS in our will.

(LLS), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of activities, functional expenses and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. Management's Responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditors' Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on The Board of Directors The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc.: November 5, 2019the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the organization's preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the organization's internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Opinion In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. as of June 30, 2019, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

(LLS) is the world's largest voluntary health agency dedicated to finding cures for blood cancers and providing services to blood cancer patients, their families, and caregivers. LLS's mission is to cure leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, and myeloma and improve the quality of life of patients and their families. LLS research grants have funded many of today's most promising advances for the treatment of blood cancer patients, including targeted therapies and immunotherapies. LLS is a leading source of publicly available information regarding blood cancer and education and support programs. LLS influences public policies that accelerate the development and approval of new blood cancer therapies and advocates for all blood cancer patients and their families, helping patients navigate their cancer treatments and access to quality, affordable and coordinated care. LLS is dedicated to removing barriers to care by representing the healthcare and medical research interests of patients and families to policy makers at all levels of government. (b) Principles of Consolidation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of LLS that encompass the National Office of LLS and its fifty six chapters in the United States, and LLS's not for profit affiliates, including The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society of Canada, Inc. (LLSC) and its five chapters in Canada, The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Programs, Inc. (LLSRP), The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society Research Foundation (LLSRF), and PearlPoint Cancer Support, Inc. (PPCS). Effective March 28, 2016, LLS became the sole member of PPCS. Effective February 8, 2018, PPCS was dissolved. All significant intercompany and intra LLS accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. (c) Tax-Exempt Status LLS, LLSRP and LLSRF qualify as charitable organizations as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3) and, accordingly, are exempt from federal income taxes under Internal Revenue Code Section 501(a). Additionally, since these organizations are publicly supported, contributions qualify for the maximum charitable contribution deduction under the Internal Revenue Code. LLSC is registered as a charitable organization under the Income Tax Act (Canada) and is, therefore, not subject to income taxes if certain disbursement requirements are met. LLS and its related entities recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained. Income generated from activities unrelated to exempt purposes are subject to tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 511. There were no entities that recognized any unrelated business income tax liability for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. (d) Estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires LLS's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The significant estimates made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements include allocation of expenses, and valuation of donated goods, services and media. Actual results could differ from those estimates.The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2019 (with comparative amounts for the year ended June 30, 2018) (Amount in thousands) (continues \u00bb)ANNUAL REPORT 2019 45Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (e) Risks and Uncertainties LLS invests in various investment securities. Investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate risks, fluctuations in market values, and credit risks. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities, it is at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet. LLS's principal source of revenue is contributions by the general public. Accordingly, LLS's operations are dependent upon individual contributions, that are affected by general economic conditions, employment levels, and other factors over which LLS has little or no control. By contrast to the granularity of the general public donations, the Co Pay program in 2019 and 2018 was funded by six donors, respectively. In addition, the Beat AML Master Trial was primarily funded by seven donors in 2019 and 2018, respectively. (f) Summarized Financial Information The consolidated financial statements are presented with 2018 summarized information. With respect to the consolidated statement of activities, such prior year information is not presented by net asset class and, in the consolidated statement of functional expenses, 2018 expenses by object are presented in total rather than by functional category. Accordingly, such information should be read in conjunction with LLS's 2018 consolidated financial statements from which the summarized information was derived. (g) Subsequent Events LLS evaluated subsequent events after the balance sheet date of June 30, 2019 through November 5, 2019, which was the date the consolidated financial statements were issued, and concluded that no additional disclosures are required. (h) Net Asset Classifications To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions placed on the use of resources available to LLS, funds that have similar characteristics have been classified into two net asset categories as follows: Net assets without donor restrictions: Consist of funds that are fully available, at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors, for LLS to utilize in any of its programs or supporting services. Net assets with donor restrictions: Consist of funds that are restricted by donors for a specific time period and/or purpose. Also included in this category are net assets subject to donor imposed restrictions, which stipulate that the principal be maintained by LLS, but permits LLS to expend part or all of the income and gains derived there from. Expirations of restrictions are reported as net assets released from restrictions when the donor stipulated purpose has been fulfilled and/or the amount has been appropriated in compliance with the Board approved spending policy (note 6). Revenue and gains and losses on investments and other assets and liabilities are reported as changes in net assets without restrictions unless limited by explicit donor imposed restrictions or by law. Expenses are reported as decreases in net assets without donor restrictions. LLS delineates changes in net assets without donor restrictions as operating or non operating activities. Operating activities include all operating revenues and expenses that are an integral part of its programs and supporting activities and net assets released from donor restrictions to support operating expenditures. The measure of operations include support for operating activities from both with donor restrictions and without donor restrictions designated for long term investment according to LLS's spending rate policy (note 6). Non operating activities include changes in fair value of investments and foreign currency translation adjustment and other nonrecurring items. (i) Foreign Currency Translation LLSC uses the Canadian dollar as its functional currency. Accordingly, the currency translation of the financial statements of LLSC to U.S. dollars is included as a translation adjustment in the consolidated statement of activities.(continues \u00bb)The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc. / June 30, 2019 (with comparative amounts for the year ended June 30, 2018) (Amount in thousands)46 (j) Fair Value Measurements Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted or published prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2 inputs other than quoted or published prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. LLS follows the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820, Fair Value Measurement, for its alternative investments that do not have readily determinable fair values, including hedge funds, limited partnerships, and other funds. This guidance allows, as a practical expedient, for the estimation of the fair value of investments in investment companies for which the investment does not have a readily determinable fair value, using net asset value (NAV) per share or its equivalent, as reported by the investment managers. The classification of investments in the fair value hierarchy is not necessarily an indication of the risks, liquidity, or degree of difficulty in estimating the fair value of each investment's underlying assets and liabilities. (k) Contributions, Grants and Deferred Revenue Contributions are recorded as revenue, at their fair value, when received or promised unconditionally. Contributions received with donor restrictions that limit their use are reported as revenues with donor restrictions. When a donor restriction is met through the passage of time or fulfillment of a purpose restriction, net assets with donor restrictions are reclassified to net assets without donor restrictions and reported in the consolidated statement of activities as net assets released from restrictions. Contributions expected to be received after one year are discounted at a risk adjusted rate of return. Amortization of the discount is recorded as additional contribution revenue in accordance with the donor imposed restrictions, if any, on the contributions. Conditional contributions are recognized as revenue when the conditions have been substantially met. Certain grants are accounted for as exchange transactions whereby revenue is recognized when the related expenses are incurred. Amounts received under these arrangements but not yet expended are reported as deferred revenue. (l) Service Revenue Service revenue is accounted for as an exchange transaction whereby revenue is recognized when the related expenses are incurred. Amounts received under these arrangements but not yet expended are reported as deferred revenue. (m) Donated Goods and Services LLS has determined that certain of the donated goods and services it receives meet the criteria for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. The value of contributed goods was determined based on fair market value estimates. The value of contributed services was determined for volunteers that possess specialized skills, and would otherwise need to be purchased. These goods and services are recognized as revenue and expense (note 9).

The value of contributed media, which is recognized in the consolidated financial statements, was estimated based on the placement, audience, and demographics of the PSA's (note 9). (o) Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents consist of short term investments with an original maturity of three months or less from date of purchase, except for amounts held in investments. (p) Investments Investments are stated at fair value based upon quoted or published market prices, except for the fair values of alternative investments which are based on NAVs provided by the fund managers or general partners, based upon the underlying net assets of the funds consistent with the concepts of ASC 820. These values are reviewed and evaluated by management. (q) Fixed Assets and Depreciation Fixed assets, which consist principally of equipment, software, and leasehold improvements, are recorded at cost, and are depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or the terms of the leases, if shorter, ranging 2 to 10 years (leasehold improvements 7 years; furniture, fixtures, and office equipment 7 to 10 years, and computer equipment and software 2 to 5 years). (r) Other Long Term Liabilities Other long term liabilities represent LLS's liability for the Internal Revenue Code Section 457 deferred compensation plans recorded at fair market value (note 11), straight line rent of office leases (note 12), and capital leases. (s) Professional Fees Professional fees included in the consolidated financial statements principally include professional fund raising fees, contracted software development, and legal and auditing fees. (t) Adopted Accounting Pronouncements The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016 14, Presentation of Financial Statements of Not for Profit Entities, which among other things, changes how not for profit entities report net asset classes, expenses and liquidity in their financial statements. LLS adopted the main provisions of this guidance which include, the reduction of the number of net asset classes from three to two: with donor restrictions, previously reported as temporally restricted net assets of $90,221 and permanently restrictions net assets of $3,152, in 2018, and without donor restrictions, previously reported as unrestricted net assets of $149,199, in 2018; the presentation of expenses by their function and their natural classification in one location; and quantitative and qualitative informa - tion about the management of liquid resources and availability of financial assets to meet cash needs within one year of the balance sheet date.

Management is evaluating the effect ASU 2014 09 will have on its consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2018 08, Not for Profit Entities (Topic 958) : Clarifying the Scope and the Accounting Guidance for Contribution Received and Contributions Made - This ASU, effective for the LLS's fiscal year ending June 30, 2020, is intended to clarify how entities determine whether to account for a transfer of assets (or a reduction, settlement, or cancellation of a lability) as an exchange transaction or a contribution based on whether commensu - rate value has been received or transferred. The new guidance also clarifies that a contribution is conditional if the agreement includes both a barrier that must be overcome for the recipient to be entitled to the assets transferred and a right of return for the transferred assets or a right of release of a promisor's obligation to transfer assets. Management is evaluating the effect ASU 2018 08 will have on its consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2016 02, Leases (Topic 842) - This guidance, effective for LLS's fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, requires a lessee to recognize a right of use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments on the consolidated balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Management is evaluating the effect ASU 2016 02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. (v) Functional Allocation of Expense The costs of providing the various programs and other activities have been summarized on a functional basis. Accordingly certain costs attributable to more than one program or supporting services function are allocated using cost allocation methods such as square footage and estimate of time and effort. LLS allocates expenses relating to the operation and maintenance of plant and depreciation using building square footage based on functional use. 2) Research LLS has various activities that are utilized to carry out its mission as presented below: Research: Awards and Grants: Awards and grants for research are approved by LLS's Board of Directors and are recognized as expense when contractual conditions have been satisfied. The budgets for multi year grants, which are generally two to five years in length, are approved on an annual basis and may be terminated at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors. LLS has multi year grant commitments of $39,093 at June 30, 2019, which are conditioned upon future events and, accordingly, are not recorded. LLS has unconditional grants payable of $50,974 and $51,673 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which are anticipated to be paid in the next year. Grant refunds of approximately $1,665 and $984 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, have been netted against awards and grants expense. Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP): TAP is LLS's strategic initiative to speed the development of blood cancer treatments and supportive diagnostics by creating business alliances with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. TAP provides funding for investigational new drug enabling studies and clinical stage projects. TAP contracts are recognized as an expense in the year program milestones are achieved. Multi year contracts, which are generally two to three years in length, are reviewed against milestones on a quarterly basis and may be terminated at the discretion of LLS's Board of Directors. LLS has contract commitments of $14,471 and $12,745 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, that are conditioned upon future events and, accordingly, are not recorded. Grant refunds of approximately $320 and $591 as of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively have been netted against therapy acceleration program contractual return.

Revenue is recognized when donations are received while expenses are recognized as patient applications are approved for participation according to program criteria and on availability of funding. The Co-Pay Assistance payable of $94,957 and $54,696 has been established based on approved patient applications received through June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. At June 30, 2019, net assets with donor restrictions include $43,279 received through June 30, 2019, which are available for expenditure and are intended to be awarded in future periods. The following summarizes the activities of the Co-Pay Assistance program as of June 30, 2019.

This strategy creates indirect exposure to LLS through short sales of securities, trading in future and forward contracts, and other derivative products. Derivatives are investment contracts used to hedge risk. While these financial instruments may contain varying degrees of risk, LLS's risk with respect to such transactions is limited to its capital balance in each investment. LLS's alternative investments contain various redemption restrictions with required written notice ranging from 45-95 days. By contrast, all of LLS's nonalternative investments are highly liquid and can be redeemed daily without restriction. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, the following table summarizes the redemption provisions for those investments reported at NAV: 2019 2018 Redemption period: Monthly $ 1,600 \u2014 Quarterly 4,000 6,380 Total $ 8,314 8,066Semi-Annual Annual1,000 \u2014 1,714 1,686 As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, LLS had no unfunded commitments on its alternative investments. 5) Financial Assets LLS goal is to maintain financial assets to meet the requirements of all outstanding commitments, excluding Co-Pay, both current and conditional as well as a minimum of 25-50% of annual general expenditures. LLS considers all expenditures related to its ongoing mission-related activities as well as the conduct of services undertaken to support those activities to be general expenditures, excluding expenditures related to LLS Co-Pay Program. As part of LLS liquidity plan, excess cash is invested in short term investments, including money market accounts, fixed income and equities. In addition to available financial assets, LLS operates with a balanced budget and anticipates collecting sufficient revenue to cover all general expenditures. Refer to the statement of cash flows, which identifies the sources and uses of LLS' cash and shows positive cash generated by operations for fiscal years 2019 and 2018.

LLS has interpreted the relevant law as allowing LLS to appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of an endowment fund as LLS determines is prudent considering the uses, benefits, purposes, and duration for which the endowment fund is established, subject to the intent of the donor as expressed in the gift instrument. LLS has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment funds while seeking to protect the original value of the gift. The spending rate policy at June 30, 2019 and 2018 was 4%, plus any additional amounts advised by donors. Under this policy, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results consistent with LLS's overall investment strategy. The following table presents changes in the donor restricted endowment funds for the year ended June 30, 2019 and 2018: Endowment net assets at July 1 Investment income Foreign currency translation adjustment Appropriation for expenditure Endowment net assets at June 30 $ 6,577 304 2 (303)2019 2018 $ 6,580 6,5776,282 551 (7) (249) 7) Contribution and other receivables LLS's contribution and other receivables at June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 consist of unconditional promises to give, receivables associated with service revenue, and legacies for which the underlying wills have been declared valid by the probate court and no other conditions are required to be met.

LLS contri - butions are based on a percentage of each eligible employee's salary and years of service. Expenses under this plan aggregated $2,432 and $2,336 for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. LLS has nonqualified deferred compensation plans for its executive staff subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code Section 457 (the 457 Plans). There were no expenses incurred for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018. The assets of the 457 Plans are included in investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and amounted to approximately $1,747 and $1,586 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The liabilities of the 457 Plans are included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and amounted to approxi - mately $1,747 and $1,586 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 12) Lease Commitments The leases for premises, which LLS's National Office and chapters occupy, expire on various dates through March 31, 2031, and provide for certain payments subject to escalation and periodic rate increases relating to real estate taxes, operating expenses, and utilities.
