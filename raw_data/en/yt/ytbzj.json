This consultation sets out the draft framework which will be used to help us understand the extent to which our policies and programmes are making an impact. It is also the intention that the framework will be used by everyone who leads, commissions and delivers services in Wales for children and families from pregnancy up to age seven (the end of Foundation Phase) as a tool to drive improvements at local level. It will provide evidence of whether they are making a positive difference to the lives of 0 to 7-year-olds and their families.

It may also be seen by other Welsh Government staff to help them plan future consultations. The Welsh Government intends to publish a summary of the responses to this document. We may also publish responses in full. Normally, the name and address (or part of the address) of the person or organisation who sent the response are published with the response. This helps to show that the consultation was carried out properly. If you do not want your name or address published, please tell us this in writing when you send your response. We will then blank them out. Names or addresses we blank out might still get published later, though we do not think this would happen very often. The Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 allow the public to ask to see information held by many public bodies, including the Welsh Government. This includes information which has not been published. However, the law also allows us to withhold information in some circumstances. If anyone asks to see information we have withheld, we will have to decide whether to release it or not. If someone has asked for their name and address not to be published, that is an important fact we would take into account. However, there might sometimes be important reasons why we would have to reveal someone's name and address, even though they have asked for them not to be published. We would get in touch with the person and ask their views before we finally decided to reveal the information.

The Plan detailed the direction of travel for the next 10 years, describing key actions we will take over the short and medium term as we progress towards a fairer society. We are pleased that we have an Early Years and Childcare Plan for Wales and that progress is already starting to be made. The first annual progress report published in July outlined some of the key achievements th at have been made in Wales since the launch of the Plan. However, this is only the beginning. The Plan set out an ambitious and stretching programme for change. It is crucial that we ensure the polices and programmes that we are investing in are making a s ignificant impact; improving children's life chances. This is why we are developing an Early Ye ars Outcomes Framework. T his will provide us with a tool to draw on evidence and track progress locally and nationally. Seeing what works well and not so well will help us to focus resources on activity that is shown to have a positive impact on the outcomes for children . We have a commi tted, dedicated early years workforce in Wales. There are already many examples of services working together to provide effic ient, more joined -up services for children and families. The Early Years Outcomes Framework demonstrates how cross -cutting this agenda is and will be able to be used to support this collaborative approach . A number of valuable discussions with a range of stakeholders have already been held about what should be included in the f ramework; whether the suggested outcomes are the mos t relevant, important factors that we should be aiming for and what the best, most robust indicators are. The feedback that we ha ve received so far has helped shape the framework in this document. For this to be a succe ss and make a difference it is essential that we have continued commitment and buy -in from everyone involved in leading, commissioning and delivering services for f amilies and children from pregnancy up to the age of seven. This f ramework should be relevant and useful which is why we need to h ear your views . Huw Lewis AM Minister for Education and Skills Lesley Griffiths AM Minister for Communities and Tackling Poverty Mark Drakeford AM Minister for Health and Social Service s 3 What we want to achieve In Building a Brighter Future: Early Years and Childc are Plan (EYCP) (2013) we made a commitment to develop and consult on an Early Years Outcomes Framework. The development of an Early Years Outcomes Framework will help Welsh Government to understand how great an impact our early years polic ies and program mes are having on children's lives . It will support the way we report progress against the EYCP . It will help to identify where further improvement is needed and where we may need to prioritise in the short, medium and long term. Although not the primary purpose , it is hoped that t he framework will also help individuals across the early years sector1in Wales understand the contribution they make to achieving improved outcomes. In time we would want to see this framework being used to support plannin g and evaluation at local level, through the use of performance measures. By defining the outcomes that we want for children in the early years the framework will help focus resources on activities that have been shown to make a positive difference. It will su pport a unified approach to planning, delivery and evaluation which will also bring about improved, collaborative services. We want everyone working in the early y ears sector - from senior leaders to frontline staff - to feel ownership of the shared outc omes and work together to make a difference to them. 1 The term Early Years sector is used to describe everyone who leads, commissions and delivers services for children and families from pregnancy up to age seven 4 Where are we now? The Early Years Partnership Board was established in January 2014. It has been jointly chaired by the Minister for Education and Skills and the Deputy Minister for Tackling Poverty at the time . Membership includes representatives from local government, health, education, academia and the third sector (further details can be found on the Welsh Government website at http://wales.gov.uk/topics/educationandskills/earlyyearshome/early -years - partnership -board/?lang=en ). The Partnership Board has o verseen the development of the Early Years Outcomes F ramework to date. We discussed a draft of the framework in June 2014 in three stakeholder workshops across Wales. The feedback from these workshops was considered by the Partnership Board on 17 July. The framework was revised in order to incorporate the comments and feedback re ceived, as agreed by the Partnership Board. 5 Context There a re already a number of other frameworks and / or initiatives in place that relate to or have an impact on the early years, both designed by Welsh Government and more widely. It is important that these are considered within the scope of this work. Annex A maps the proposed outcomes against relevant, existing frameworks and / or related initiatives . The Early Years Outcomes Framework is being developed in parallel with a number of other developmen ts that could impact on the indicators and / or measures included in the framework. The framework will very much be a live, 'working document' reviewed and refreshed in order to incorporate new, relevant data as it becomes available , particularly as relate d policies are changed and developed . Some of the main developments that are likely to have an impact in the next year are detailed here: In July 2014 Welsh Government published \"Devolution, Democracy and Delivery - Improving public services for people in Wales\" . This sets out a new agenda for improving public services through streng thening local democracy and delivery , alongside reforming the devo lution settlement . The proposals include sustaining and refocusing local government through a series of merger s, improving the integration of health and social care services, streamlining partnerships and aligning collaborations . A significant part of this agenda is also concentrated on raising ambition and performance of public services . It notes that the Well -being of Future Generations (Wales) Bill (laid July 2014) provides the framework for achieving clarity of purpose for the longer term. The Bill strengthens existing governance arrangements in specified public bodies in order to achieve the Wales we want . The Bill provides for a set of long-term well -being goals for Wales. These are for a prosperous; resilient; more equal Wales; with cohesive communities; and a vibrant culture and thriving Welsh language. The Bill requires Welsh Ministers to establish nationa l indicators to measure progress towards the achievement of the well-being goals and report on them annually. A review of assessment and the national curriculum is currently being undertaken. Phase 1 of this review has proceeded and a consultation has been completed seeking views on proposed changes to curriculum and assessment arrangements in relation to the Areas of Learning (AoL) for Language, Literacy and Communication Skills, and Mathematical Development and to the Programmes of Study for English, We lsh and mathematics . Final versions of the AoLs and programmes of study will be published in autumn 2014 in readiness for statutory implementation in September 2015. 6 In addition, Professor Graham Donaldson has been appointed to lead a wide-reaching and independent review of the national curriculum and assessment arrangements in Wales . He has been commissioned to articulate a clear, coherent vision for assessment and the national curriculum in Wales from Foundation Phase to Key Stage 4. Professor Donaldso n is due to report his findings to the Minister for Education and Skills at the turn of the year. Public Health Wales set up an early years pathfinder project in December 2010 to raise the priority given to early years health and well -being, help coordin ate progress, identify gaps and develop and evaluate interventions. They have reviewed what data is available and agreed on a range of indicators that can be used to track progress. Work is now underway to progress the development of an early years surveil lance system for Wales. We are working closely with Public Health Wales to ensur e the health indicators in the early years outcomes f ramework align with those in the pathfinder project. In the EYCP we stated that we would work towards a more coherent system of assessing, tracking and monitoring the development and progress of children in the early years. The early years development and assessment framework (EYDAF) is being developed which will provide a single overarching 0 -7 assessment framework and a s uite of linked assessment tools that can be used to chart children's progress. The findings of the review of assessment and the national curriculum will inform the development of the EYDAF. It is therefore the aim that the on - entry assessment tool will be introduced on a statutory basis from September 2015. We are currently considering the recommendations of the independent Stocktake of the Foundation Phase in Wales and the independent Review of Childcare and Early Education Registration, Regulation and I nspection , both published in 2014 . These reports include proposal s for the development of joint or unified inspection processes across early years settings which will drive improvements in the care, learning and well -being outcomes for children. CSSIW and Estyn are already working together within existing systems to develop and test an integrated inspection framework in non -maintained regulated care settings that also provide early education for children (before compulsory school age). This will also includ e learning from the pilot study of CSSIW's Quality Judgement Framework. Once implemented the joint framework will help improve the safety of these settings and their quality of care, as well as making progress towards the Foundation Phase learning outcomes . It will also provide a good evidence base for assessing the quality of child care provision and tracking improvement. 7 With the UK Government's changes to the welfare system there will be an increased responsibility on the claimant to actively prepare fo r and subsequently obtain employment. As Universal Credit rolls out further and replaces benefits such as Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit then we will see an impact on families in Wales. Support for childcare within Universal Credit will be provid ed as an additional cost element which is subject to an earnings taper. The main changes to childcare support available under Universal Credit mean that families will be eligible for support regardless of the number of hours they work as the hours rule does not apply. Under Universal Credit, 70% of actual paid out childcare costs can be claimed up to a maximum of \u00a3532.29 a month for one child, and \u00a3912.50 for two or more children. From April 2016, we understand that the proportion will rise to 85%. The D epartment for Work and Pensions (DWP) will make Budgeting Advances available under Universal Credit to cover upfront childcare costs for claimants who have a confirmed job offer. The proposed Early Years Outcomes Framework has been designed to include what is in place at the moment. It may be that the developments outlined above will bring about indicators that are better than those that we currently have. As noted, the framework will be continually reviewed and refreshed to incorporate such developments. 8 Proposals for an Early Years Outcomes Framework What is an outcomes framework? The Early Years Outcomes Framework has been developed using a Results Based Accountability (RBA) approach. RBA can help us get better at planning and delivering public ser vices so that they enhance the lives of citizens. Mark Friedman ( Trying Hard Is Not Good Enough , 2005) describes RBA as a disciplined way of thinking and taking action that can be used to improve the quality of life in communities and also the performance of programmes and services. RBA draws a distinction between population outcomes and service performance (the difference that services make for their customers). It gets us to separate this out, be clear about what success looks like for each of these levels and then put it back together again. We can then examine the things that we are doing (programmes and projects and the services being delivered) in the context of the things that we are trying to change / improve i.e. outcomes. This clarifies accountabi lity - there is collective accountability around outcomes and direct accountability around service delivery. What outcomes will the framework measure? A number of discussions have been held with stakeholders across the early years sector about what are the most important, quality of life conditions that we want for all 0 -7 years olds in Wales. We have also reviewed relat ed frameworks and initiatives. As a result of these discussions and mapping exercise we propose the following outcomes : All children in the early years: - are and feel safe - are cared for, supported and valued - are resilient, capable and coping - are healthy - learn and develop - do not live in poverty - are happy Q. Are the seven outcomes representative of what is important to children aged between 0-7? Q. If the outcomes are not representative, what is missing? 9 Happiness and well-being We tested an earlier version of the framework with a number of stakeholders in June this year. At these workshops the outcome that generated the most discussio n was 'children in the early years are happy'. There was agreement that if we are to include such an outcome it is important that we define what we mean by 'happy'. A literature review has been undertaken and it is evident that happiness and well -being is argued as a dynamic, ambiguous and complex concept and a broad brush, catch -all term commonly used. During the discussions with stakeholders many different terms were used interchangeably such as emotional literacy, emotional intelligence, positive mental health, emotional, social or physical well -being. So for the purposes of the early years outcomes framework we draw on the Social Services and Well -being (Wales) Act (2014 ) which states that \"well - being\", in relation to a person, means well -being in rela tion to any of the following: a) Physical and mental health and emotional well -being; b) Protection from abuse and neglect; c) Education, training or recreation; d) Domestic, family and personal relationships; e) Contribution made to society; f) Securing rights and entitle ments; g) Social and economic well -being ; h) Suitability of living accommodation In relation to a child, \"well -being\" also includes: a) Physical, intellectual, emotional, social and behavioural development; b) \"welfare\" as that word is interpreted for the purposes o f the Children Act 1989. Although this is a definition for well -being it covers the elements that were discussed at the stakeholder workshops as being the key factors of children's happiness for the purposes of the framework . The definition also covers elements of a number of the other proposed outcomes in the framework such as 'learn and develop' and 'are cared for, supported and valued'. It could be argued that if all of the other outcomes are met, then a by -product would be happiness. Including 'chil dren in the early years are happy' in the framework presents methodological and practical challenges. The majority of c urrent researc h and data collection is for children aged above 8 years; there is a lack of data representing younger children. 10 Objecti ve measures of well -being are more commonly used than subjective. In 2013, Report Card 11 was produced by UNICEF reporting on the well - being of children (aged between 11 -15) on five dimensions of well -being : material well -being, health and safety, educatio n, behaviours and risks and housing and environment . Again, these measurements align with those proposed within the early years outcomes framework across all the outcomes . This streng thens the argument that if we make improvements in these areas, children' s well -being , as defined by UNCEF, will also be improved. Q. Should 'all children in the early years are happy' be included as a standalone outcome? Q If 'all children in the early years are happy' is a standalone outcome what are the most appropriate indicators? Aims A number of aims have been added bene ath the o utcomes. These are our overarching priority targets which span a number of o utcomes. The purpose of these is to clarify and quantify what we want to achieve. It is recognised that indicato rs and measures can contribute to multiple outcomes. The Aims have therefore been added to capture this effectively. Welsh language Improving the accessibility and availability of Welsh provision to children and families is a key element of the EYCP. In our Welsh medium Education Strategy we set out our commitment to increase the number of people of all ages who use the Welsh language with their families, in their communities and in the workplace . Although the Aim 'services are accessible and available which meet parents ', families' and children's needs' links to this , we have not included an explicit Aim relating to the provision of Welsh as it is integral to everything that we d o. Indicators For each out come there are a number of indicators that refle ct the extent to which the outcome is being achieved. Friedman recommends that indicators should communicate well, tell us something of central importance about the outcome and have good data. We have therefore focused on specific indicators and kept to a short list. We also have a data development agenda. This is where new or improved data is needed , both for indicators and performance measures . 11 Data Development Percentage of children reaching or exceeding their developmental milestones Data is cur rently only available for Flying Start children. The development of an early years development and assessment framework will facilitate the collection of data for all children Percentage of pre -school settings inspected reported with good or better judgme nts for Quality of Life in CSSIW inspections As stated in the 'context' section above, this will be considered as part of the Estyn and CSSIW joint inspection framework Percentage of 0 -7 year old Welsh residents presenting at A&E departments having had ac cidental injuries in the home EDDS is a patient level database that is managed by NHS Wales Informatics Services. Detailed breakdowns can be requested from them. However, the data quality for some data items is poor and would need to be further developed i f this were an indicator in the Framework Percentage of mothers that gave up smoking during pregnancy (measured at 36-38 weeks or at onset of labour) These are part of th e Maternity Indicators set. The quality of the data required to populate these is being assessed by Public Health Wales and NHS Wales Informatics Service. Percentage of mothers who gain no more than the recommended weight during pregnancy At the stakeholder workshops the idea of 'school readiness' was discussed. The on -entry assessment to the Foundation Phase tool being developed as part of the EYDAF will assess a learner against a baseline that aligns with the end of Foundation Phase assessment. On that basis, it will be assessing a learner against components of educational outcomes ide ntified as being relevant to the on -entry requirements to the Foundation Phase. This forms part of the data development agenda. Performance measures A performance measure is measurable information which helps quantify if a service works. This prompts the questions how much did we do, how well did we do it and is anyone better off as a result. As the early years outcomes framework is relevant to everyone in the early years, childcare and play sector but performance measures are specific to individual organisations and / or services we have just included examples of performance measures that could be used. These wil l not be applicable to everyone; they are for illustrative purposes only. 12 Some of the indicators and performance measures are applicable for more than one of the outcomes. So although they are interchangeable across columns w e have placed them against the outcome that we believe it is the strongest indicator for. How will the framework be used and when? Building a Brighter Future was laun ched in July 2013. We will review the progress made against the Plan on an annual basis and in 2016 carry out a full evaluation. The early years outcomes framework will be used to support this annual reporting cycle. In July 2015 the data outlined in the framework will be collated and presented against the outcomes. This will provide us with a national picture of how we are having an impact on the early years. Where possible, the data will provide the baseline for the coming years. We will expect to see p rogress made. In order to driv e improvements the data collected for the indicators will be reviewed by the relevant teams in Welsh Governmen t. Through discussions with stakeholders, performance measures will be agreed. Many of these performance measures w ill already be available; others will need to be collected. As performance measures are often specific to individual organisations and / or services the measures included in the draft framework are for illustrative purposes only. It is appreciated that there should be a degree of consistency at local and regional level to support collaborative working. Some early years programmes, such as Flying Start and Families First, have taken the approach of having a bank of performance measures from which local t eams can choose which to use, according to their needs. In conjunction with the collation of the early years data in July 2015 consideration will be given over whether a menu of early years performance measures should be developed. It would be important t hat these would align with those already in place for specific programmes to avoid duplication. Service providers will be able to use the data collected to drive improvements. This already takes place in a number of organisations. An example of an RBA scorecard that is used by the Flying Start team in Cardiff Council can be found at Annex C . Early Years Outcomes Framework for Wales Achieve developmental milestones between 2-3 years of age and attainment milestones at 7 years of age Achieve at least 95% uptake in all scheduled childhood immunisation programmes (except seasonal flu) to ensure population immunity That all women experience safe and positive pregnancies and childbirth that result in the birth of more healthy babies Services are accessible and available which meet parent's, families' and children's needs Continue to improve opportunities for all children to play in safetyImprove the overall attainment levels of all children in Wales To narrow the attainment gap at the end of Foundation Phase between those eligible for Free School Meals and those not eligible, by 10% by 2017 Increase the proportion of 7 year olds achieving outcome 5 or above at the end of Foundation Phase (overlaps with 'are happy')All children in the early years (0-7): are and feel safeare cared for, supported and valuedare resilient, capable and copingare healthy learn and develop do not live in poverty are happy Aims Population Indicators EXAMPLES of Performance/Quality of Service Measures1.

Children will turn 30 months during the summer of this year theref ore will be reassessed using PLS at that point. Evaluation of the pilot is ongoing. Results of the pilot will be presented separately once they are available. 3. YMTD - The YMTD group was not delivered in the summer term as the IT equipment required the purchase of new laptops and encryption. This meant that not all peer support groups were held. Two groups in the Spring term were cancelled due to low numbers attending. There is a lo w percentage of attendance compared to referrals although if parents attend, 100% att ended for 6 sessions or more. There is a low percentage of parents increasing by 40% in their use of the strategies as these figures were taken from only one group: groups did not run in the summer term; groups that ran in the Autumn term were not scored due to IT issues. Of the parents scored many of them had good pre -group scores. 4. Mandatory Training - There has been an increase in the percentage of staff attending the mandatory speech, language and communication training alt hough this can vary significa ntly between teams, ranging from 50% to 100% attendance 33 Thank you to the Cardiff Flying Start team for supplying this working example. 3.
