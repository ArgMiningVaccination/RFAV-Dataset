Preprints are preliminary reports of work that have not been certified by peer review. They should not be relied on to guide clinical practice or health-related behavior and should not be reported in news media as established information. medRxiv is for the distribution of preprints - complete but unpublished manuscripts - that describe human health research conducted, analyzed, and interpreted according to scientific principles. Research articles, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, clinical research design protocols and data articles may be posted. MedRxiv is not intended for case reports (single or in series), narrative reviews (see below), editorials, letters, opinion pieces and hypotheses that lack data, work not premised on modern biology/physiology or allopathic medicine, laboratory protocols/recipes, theses, term papers, textbook excerpts or individual components of research articles such as figures, tables, and datasets. medRxiv was founded by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL), a not-for-profit research and educational institution, Yale University, and BMJ, a global healthcare knowledge provider. The server is owned and operated by CSHL. medRxiv provides a platform for researchers to share, comment, and receive feedback on their work prior to journal publication. medRxiv aims to improve the openness and accessibility of scientific findings, enhance collaboration among researchers, document provenance of ideas, and inform ongoing and planned research through more timely reporting of completed research. medRxiv is a non-profit community resource and is not linked to any one publisher or journal. Articles are not peer-reviewed, edited, or typeset before being posted online. However, all articles undergo [a basic screening process](https://connect.medrxiv.org/news/2022/06/13/screening_procedures) for offensive and/or non-scientific content and for material that might pose a health risk or be considered [dual use research of concern](https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/ethical-conduct/special-research-considerations/dual-use-research), and are checked for plagiarism. No endorsement of a manuscript's methods, assumptions, conclusions, or scientific quality by CSHL, Yale University, or BMJ is implied by its appearance in medRxiv. A manuscript may be submitted prior to, or concurrently with, submission to a journal but will not be posted if it has already been accepted for publication, published, or posted elsewhere. Authors may submit a revised version of a manuscript to medRxiv at any time (prior to the manuscript's acceptance for publication in a journal). Once posted on medRxiv, manuscripts receive a digital object identifier (DOI), so are discoverable, citable, and indexed by numerous search engines and third-party services and cannot be removed. medRxiv reserves the right to decline to post any preprint for any reason. PRIVACY POLICY: COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL DATA Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory is committed to protecting the privacy of authors, medRxiv Affiliates, and other users of the medRxiv submission system and website. [Click to read the full Privacy Policy.](http://cshlp.org/misc/preprints_privacy_policy) INQUIRIES For information about manuscript submission or any other aspect of medRxiv, please contact [medrxiv@cshl.edu](mailto:medrxiv@cshl.edu). TEXT & DATA MINING medRxiv provides free and unrestricted access to all articles posted on the server. We believe this should apply not only to human readers but also to machine analysis of the content. A growing [variety of resources](http://medrxiv.org/tdm) have been created to facilitate this access. DIRECT TRANSFER FROM MEDRXIV TO JOURNALS (M2J) medRxiv can save authors time in submitting papers to journals by transmitting their manuscript files and metadata directly from medRxiv. This means authors do not have to spend time re-loading manuscript files and re-entering author information at the journal. Partners currently participating in M2J are listed below. - American Journal of Epidemiology - The American Journal of Human Genetics - Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases - Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy - Archives of Disease in Childhood - BJGP Open - BMC Medicine - The BMJ - BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine - BMJ Global Health - BMJ Health & Care Informatics - BMJ Innovations - BMJ Leader - BMJ Medicine - BMJ Military Health - BMJ Neurology Open - BMJ Nutrition, Prevention & Health - BMJ Open - BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care - BMJ Open Gastroenterology - BMJ Open Ophthalmology - BMJ Open Quality - BMJ Open Respiratory Research - BMJ Open Science - BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine - BMJ Paediatrics Open - BMJ Public Health - BMJ Quality & Safety - BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health - BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care - BMJ Surgery, Interventions, & Health Technologies - British Journal of General Practice - British Journal of Ophthalmology - British Journal of Sports Medicine - Cancer Research Communications - Circulation - Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology - Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging - Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions - Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes - Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine - Circulation: Heart Failure - Clinical & Experimental Immunology - Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology - Cold Spring Harbor Molecular Case Studies - Diabetologia - Discovery Immunology - eGastroenterology - eLife - EMBO Molecular Medicine - Emergency Medicine Journal - Endocrine Connections - Environmental Health Perspectives - ERJ Open Research - ESMO Open - European Heart Journal - European Journal of Endocrinology - European Journal of Hospital Pharmacy - European Respiratory Journal - European Urology - Evidence-Based Mental Health - Family Medicine and Community Health - Frontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine - Frontiers in Endocrinology - Frontiers in Medicine - Frontiers in Neurology - Frontiers in Oncology - Frontiers in Psychiatry - Frontiers in Public Health - Frontiers in Surgery - Frontline Gastroenterology - Gastrointestinal Tumors - General Psychiatry - Genome Medicine - Gut - Heart - Human Genetics and Genomics Advances - Hypertension - Immunotherapy Advances - Inflammatory Intestinal Diseases - Injury Prevention - Integrated Healthcare Journal - International Journal of Gynecological Cancer - JAC - Antimicrobial Resistance - JAMA Network Open - JCI Insight - Journal of the American Heart Association - Journal of the American Society of Nephrology - Journal of Clinical Investigation - Journal of Clinical Microbiology - Journal of Clinical Pathology - Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health - Journal of Experimental Medicine - Journal of Gynecologic Oncology - Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer - Journal of Medical Ethics - Journal of Medical Genetics - Journal of Medical Imaging - Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) - Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery - Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry - Kidney360 - Kidney International - Kidney International Reports - Life Science Alliance - Lifestyle Genomics - Lupus Science & Medicine - Medicine - NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics - Nicotine & Tobacco Research - Nucleic Acids Research - Occupational & Environmental Medicine - Open Forum Infectious Diseases - Open Heart - Ophthalmic Research - Oxford Open Immunology - Oxford Open Neuroscience - Physical Therapy - PLOS Climate - PLOS Digital Health - PLOS Global Public Health - PLOS Medicine - PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases - PLOS One - PLOS Sustainability and Transformation - PLOS Water - PNAS Nexus - Postgraduate Medical Journal - Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine - Review Commons - RMD Open - Sexually Transmitted Infections - StemJournal - Stroke - Stroke: Vascular and Interventional Neurology - Stroke and Vascular Neurology - Swiss Medical Weekly - Tobacco Control - Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open - Virus Evolution - World Journal of Pediatric Surgery medRxiv in the News Coverage of the launch of medRxiv: medical research](https://www.bmj.com/content/365/bmj.l2301) The Preprint Server for Clinical Research](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/qa-new-preprint-server-for-clinical-research-65972) SCOPE medRxiv accepts preprints of articles covering all aspects of research in the health sciences.
