The guy who sent them to me, today's podcast guest [Kyal Van Der Leest](https://lvluphealth.com/pages/about-us), is the founder of [LVLUP Health (use any of the codes BEN, BEN10, BENGREENFIELD, BGL, and GREENFIELD, all for 10% off)](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/lvluphealth), a new-to-the-scene supplement company that has created a range of cutting-edge supplements using powerful ingredients that most people would not have heard of before. All the formulations were created in an attempt to reduce the multiple 6-12 products you might need to take for a health goal and simplify it down to an all-in-one product for every body system. Kyal - a nutritionist, naturopath, and functional health coach turned formulator - founded [ LVLUP Health](https://bengreenfieldlife.com/lvluphealth) to create the products he wished he could have suggested when he worked in clinics and supplement stores and used during his own health journey. A fusion of different health modalities - using what works, no matter where it comes from - LVLUP's formulations target the root causes of health issues and work on a multitude of biochemical targets in the body, providing customers with products that actually work as promised. Though he had numerous family members struggling with health issues, Kyal had a particularly desperate motivation to save his mother from stage 4 cancer, and although his mother Leanne has since passed, the products are a tribute to her. Without her, Kyal never would have learned about peptides, naturopathy, biohacking, and functional medicine, which form the foundation of LVLUP Health's approach to health and wellness. Today, LVLUP Health's products continue to provide customers with effective and accessible health solutions that honor Kyal's mother's legacy.
