But protein isn't the only supplement in town. [(Related: This Supplement Gives You More Energy, Burns Fat and Transforms Your Sex Life)](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a750481/pill-that-does-everything/) Research published in the Journal of Sports Sciences noted that supps like creatine, caffeine and bicarbonate soda \"offer the prospect of improved performance\", but we've assembled a team of drugs experts to prove that the list of supplements that are beneficial for you doesn't end there. [(Related: Can You Survive by Only Eating Supplements? We Found Out)](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a748233/surviving-on-supplements/) Below is a comprehensive list of the drugs our experts think will [improve performance, sleep](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a759145/sleep-performance-how-much/) and your [mental health](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a25670240/mens-wellness-start-taking-control/). Time to familiarise yourself with the MH medicine cupboard. Cannabidiol Cannabis and athletics may not be obvious companions, but cannabidiol, or [CBD oil](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a759279/what-to-know-before-you-try-cbd-oil-for-pain-relief/), is a non-psychoactive, fully legal extract of the plant. Studies suggest it can relieve inflammation and support muscle recovery, helping you return to the squat rack sooner. You'll be anything but a weed. Magnesium Research suggests over half of us are deficient in this mineral, which is linked to a spectrum of health benefits. It improves [sleep](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a25801014/how-to-sleep-better/) quality and, according to the University of Giessen, helps maintain your aerobic capacity. Look for the word \"citrate\" on the label: oxide and chloride varieties are harder to absorb. Inulin The alternative to yet another yogurt drink, this prebiotic powder derived from chicory root nourishes the healthy bacteria already living in your gut. Aside from supporting digestion, prebiotics have also been proven, in animal studies, to curb the physical and psychological impacts of long-term [stress](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a758381/6-obvious-signs-that-show-youre-stressed/). Nestorone Get ready for the next phase of the [sexual](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/sex/a759288/these-are-the-7-most-common-sexual-fantasies/) revolution. Scientists at LA BioMed have launched a fresh batch of studies into a gel made with testosterone and hormonal drug Nestorone, which briefly inhibits sperm production when applied to the skin. We're calling it \"son block\". Caffeine Already celebrated for its ability to pep up your power output in the gym, [caffeine](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a759281/coffee-may-help-you-live-longer-says-science/) consumed before training has also been linked to raised testosterone. Jittery types should combine it with the amino acid theanine, which will take the edge off without compromising its potency. Glycine In the exhaustive search for a sleep aid that actually lives up to its name, amino acid glycine is a promising contender. A 3g scoop, an hour before bed, has been shown to aid quality rest, plus boost mood the next day. It's naturally sweet, so add it to your [coffee](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a759172/the-best-time-of-day-to-drink-coffee-revealed/) - decaf, of course. Psilocybin Already touted as a future fix for clinical [depression](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/mental-strength/a25671693/the-rock-interview-depression/), this psychedelic compound - derived from magic mushrooms - is also proven to soothe social anxiety, quieting intrusive negative thoughts. Self-experimentation is, need we say it, very ill-advised. Ashwagandha If the words \"powerful healing herb\" trigger an eye roll, we wouldn't blame you. But this one's more fact than fad. In an Indian Journal of Psychiatry study, subjects saw a reduction in [anxiety](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/mental-strength/a759605/8-signs-someone-is-suffering-from-anxiety/) symptoms after six weeks. Less holistically, it's also linked to bench press #gains. Vitamin D3 The usefulness of vit supps is often contested, but if there's one fact on which all experts agree, it's that you need more D. Heart and bone-protecting benefits aside, it's also proven to boost [muscle strength](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/workouts/g756773/single-barbell-routine/), with D3 about 87% stronger than D2. Get your money's worth. Gelatin The Haribo ingredient, when combined with [vitamin C](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a756611/boost-your-endurance-into-extra-time/) and taken as a pre-workout supp, helps to rebuild ligaments and tendons worn down by training. Sadly, the aforementioned sweets won't do the same job - not even the \"fruit\" ones. Sodium bicarbonate You may know it better as bicarbonate of soda. A Danish review found it was as effective for boosting stamina as many sports supps. A 20g pre-gym hit neutralises lactic acid, dousing [muscle burn](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a750151/should-you-train-sore-muscles/). But whether you take yours baked or unbaked is purely up to you. Mushrooms Medicinal, non-psychoactive shrooms have gained notable traction, with reishi, chaga and co linked to raised immunity and [cancer prevention](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a759377/the-early-signs-of-skin-cancer/). Further studies are needed, but an Intergrative Medicine* review concluded they are \"promising for treatment\". Magic. Creatine Brains and brawn needn't be built separately. Not only is it one of the most reliable PEDs, creatine also enhances thought processing and delays mental fatigue. Add a scoop to [your shake](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/nutrition/a759466/are-we-all-consuming-too-much-protein/) to push out one more rep during a spreadsheet session. Aspirin Ground-breaking research has linked [depression](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/mental-strength/a759486/what-to-say-to-your-mate-when-he-has-depression/) symptoms with inflammation, leading to a trial in which patients took aspirin alongside their usual medications - with success. Though scientists are still far off ousting SSRIs altogether, MH will be watching this space. Type II Collagen Commonly associated with more aesthetic anti-ageing treatments, collagen is now being lauded for its ability to strengthen joints and ease pain - in pill form, that is, not facial jabs. If [mobility](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a755395/the-beginners-guide-to-mobility-stretching/) work is your Achilles heel, this will loosen things up, including said heels. Viagra The little blue pill became available over the counter for the first time this year. With [erectile dysfunction](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/sex/a759346/can-watching-too-much-porn-give-you-erectile-dysfunction/) (ED) on the rise among stressed-out young men, this is a smarter, safer option than any drug that pops up in your junk mail. Tadalafil Unlike Viagra, this blood flow-boosting ED drug can be taken daily - although it doesn't deliver the, er, full effect on ingestion. Better still, a 5mg dose was recently found to boost [testosterone](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/health/a749372/should-i-inject-testosterone/) by around 44 per cent in men with metabolic syndrome. Chat to your GP. Psychobiotics Certain strains of probiotics have been shown to tap into the \"gut-brain axis\" - an extensive comms network through which your digestive tract and central nervous system like to talk. Studies in nutrition, among others, have found that these pills can curb [stress](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/sex/a759737/stress-is-the-ultimate-libido-killer-research-says/) and lift your mood. Beetroot Juice Already a favourite for purple-tongued endurance athletes, beets' high nitrate levels help to deliver oxygen around the body, like legal erythropoietin (EPO). More recently, a Wake Forest University study found that taking a shot before training resulted in better \"brain connectivity\". It's the smart pre- [workout](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/building-muscle/a759424/best-back-workouts-build-a-muscular-back/) drink.
