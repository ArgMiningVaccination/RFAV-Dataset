In the early 19th century, the major emphasis in higher education was on the mastery of Greek and Latin, with little attention given to modern subjects. The founders of New York University intended to enlarge the scope of higher education to meet the needs of those aspiring to careers in business, industry, science, and the arts, as well as inlaw, medicine, and the ministry. The opening of the University of London in 1828 convinced New Yorkers that New York, too, should have a new university that fed off the energy and vibrancy of the city. An Introduction to New Y ork University / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 5 The first president of New York Uni - versity's governing council was Albert Gallatin, former adviser to Thomas Jefferson and secretary of the treasury in Jefferson's cabinet. Gallatin and his cofounders envisioned a \"national university\" that would provide a \"rational and practical education for all.\" The result of the founders' foresight is today a university that is recognized both nationally and internationally as a leader in scholarship. NYU is one of only 26 private universities in the nation to have membership in the distinguished Association of American Universities. Students come to NYU from all 50 states and more than 130 foreign countries. New York University includes three degree-granting campuses: New York City, United States; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Shanghai, China. In addition, the University has 12 global academic locations: Accra, Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, Czech Republic; Sydney, Australia; Tel Aviv, Israel; and Washington, DC, United States. Although overall the University is large, the divisions are small- to moderate-size units\u2014each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty. Enrollment in the undergraduate divisions at NYU ranges between 97 and 7,704, and the University offers over 11,000 courses and grants more than 30 different degrees. Classes vary in size, but the University strives to create a sense of community among students within and among the different disciplines.

The Division of Libraries holds 5.8 million book volumes. Its online catalog, BobCat, contains 4.5 million records, including more than 2 million e-books, over 96,000 journals, 261,893 serial titles, and 232,845 audio and video recordings. The special collections are uniquely strong in the performing arts, radical and labor history, and the history of New York and its avant-garde culture. Bobst Library serves as a center for the NYU commu - nity's intellectual life and offers approxi - mately 3,000 seats for student study. The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media is one of the world's largest academic media centers, and it resides on the 7th floor of Bobst with advanced technology to support the newest modes of music listening. The Digital Studio offers a constantly evolving, leading-edge resource for faculty and student projects and promotes and supports access to digital resources for teaching, learning, research, and arts events. The Data Services Lab provides expert staff and access to software, statistical computing, geographical information systems analysis, data collection resources, and data manage - ment services in support of quantitative research at NYU. The Fales Library, a special collection within Bobst Library, is home to the unparalleled Fales Collection of English and American Literature; the Marion Nestle Food Studies Collection, the country's largest trove of cookbooks, food writing, pamphlets, paper, and archives, dating from the 1790s; and the Downtown Collection, an extraordinary multimedia archive documenting the avant-garde New York art world since 1975. Bobst Library also houses the Tamiment Library, the country's leading repository of research materials in the history of left politics and labor. Two fellowship programs bring scholars from around the world to Tamiment to explore the history of the Cold War and its wide-ranging impact on American institutions and to research the history of progressive social policies and promote public discussion of their role in our society. Tamiment's Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives contain, among other resources, the archives of the Jewish Labor Committee and of more than 200 New York City labor organizations. Fales, Tamiment, and the University Archives hold over 41,000 linear feet of archival materials. Beyond Bobst, the library of the renowned Courant Institute of Mathematical Sci - ences focuses on research-level material in mathematics, computer science, and related fields. The Stephen Chan Library of Fine Arts at the Institute of Fine Arts (IFA) houses the rich collections that support the research and curricular needs of the institute's graduate programs in art history and archaeology. The Jack Brause Library at SPS Midtown, the most comprehensive facility of its kind, serves the information needs of every sector of the real estate community. The Library of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World (ISAW) is a resource for advanced research and graduate edu - cation in ancient civilizations from the western Mediterranean to China. The Bern Dibner Library serves the NYU Tan - don School of Engineering. The libraries An Introduction to New Y ork University / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 7 of NYU Abu Dhabi and NYU Shanghai provide access to all the resources in BobCat and are building their own collections of books and other print materials in support of the schools' developing curricula. Complementing the collections of the Division of Libraries are those of the Health Sciences Library and School of Law. The NYU Division of Libraries continually enhances its student and faculty services and expands its research collections, responding to the extraordinary growth of the University's academic programs in recent years and to the rapid expan - sion of electronic information resources. Bobst Library's professional staff includes more than 38 subject specialists who select materials and work with faculty and graduate students in every field of study at NYU. The staff also includes specialists in undergraduate outreach, instructional services, preservation, geospatial information, digital informa - tion, scholarly communication, intellec - tual property, and more. The Larger Campus New York University is an integral part of the metropolitan community of New York City\u2014the business, cultural, artistic, and financial center of the nation and the home of the United Nations. The city's extraordinary resources enrich both the academic programs and the ex - perience of living at New York University. Professors whose extracurricular activities include service as editors for publishing houses and magazines; advisers to city government, banks, school systems, and social agencies; and consultants for museums and industrial corporations bring to teaching an expe - rience of the world and a professional sophistication that are difficult to match. Students also, either through course - work or in outside activities, tend to be involved in the vigorous and varied life of the city. Research for term papers in the humanities and social sciences may take them to such diverse places as the American Museum of Natural History, the Museum of Modern Art, a garment factory, a deteriorating neighborhood, or a foreign consulate. Students in science work with their pro - fessors on such problems of immediate importance for urban society as the pollution of waterways and the con - gestion of city streets. Business majors attend seminars in corporation board - rooms and intern as executive assistants in business and financial houses. The schools, courts, hospitals, settlement houses, theatres, playgrounds, and prisons of the greatest city in the world form a regular part of the educational scene for students of medicine, dentistry, education, social work, law, business and public administration, and the creative and performing arts. The chief center for undergraduate and graduate study is at Washington Square in Greenwich Village, long famous for its contributions to the fine arts, literature, and drama and its personalized, smaller- scale, European style of living. NYU itself makes a significant contribution to the creative activity of the Village through the high concentration of faculty and students who reside within a few blocks of the University. NYU's Tandon School of Engineering, located in downtown Brooklyn, connects academics with creative research and technology in the burgeoning Tech Triangle and is just a short subway ride away from Washington Square. University housing is comprised of nearly 2,100 units housing eligible faculty and administration, and University student residence halls accommodate nearly 12,000 men and women. Many more faculty and students reside in private housing in the area.A Private University Since its founding, New York University has been a private university. It operates under a board of trustees and derives its income from tuition, endowment, grants from private foundations and government, and gifts from friends, alumni, corporations, and other private philanthropic sources. The University is committed to a policy of equal treatment and opportunity in every aspect of its relations with its faculty, students, and staff members, without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender and/or gender identity or expression, marital or parental status, national origin, ethnicity, citizenship status, veteran or military status, age, disability, and any other legally protected basis.

John W. Draper invented modern photography, and the American Chemical Society was founded here. In the arts and culture, too, it can be argued that the College not only partici - pated in but also generated much of the creative energy that has characterized Greenwich Village. The original University Building housed ateliers that were the forerunners of the current downtown art scene. And although Henry Wad - sworth Longfellow was turned down for a teaching post, literature thrived, with University Building even featured in an 1861 novel by Theodore Winthrop. Finally, this neighborhood and this institution have had a long tradition of social and political activism\u2014from the Stonecutters Riot over the construction of the University's first building in 1834 to the tragic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in 1911, a major event in U.S. labor history that took place in what is now the Brown Building. From its earliest days, then, the College on Washington Square has been at the cutting edge of intellectual, cultural, and social developments. In 1895, however, NYU's great chancellor, Henry McCracken, decided to reserve Washington Square for the professional schools, which had proliferated under his leadership, and to move University College to a beau - tiful campus in the Bronx\u2014University Heights\u2014designed by Stanford White. The College's move to the Heights reflected McCracken's \"Ivy\" aspirations for the school and his successful effort to raise quality by attracting the best students nationally. Also relevant was the ascendant, non-urban collegiate ideal of a residential community, with fine teaching, extracurricular activities, fraternities, and intercollegiate athletics. A few years later, an undergraduate presence was restored downtown with the opening of a Collegiate Division (1903), soon to become Washington Square College (1913). This school had a more diverse student body, opening its doors to women, recent immigrants, commuters, and professional students. For over 60 years, undergraduate liberal arts education at NYU took place in two locations\u2014University College (and the Engineering School) at the Heights and the College on Washington Square, both offering excellent, but different, educational and social experiences. In the 1970s, the College underwent yet another major transformation. In response to financial pressures, the Heights campus was closed in 1973, and University College merged with Washington Square College. The new institution, which is now known simply as the College of Arts & Science, is the beneficiary of both traditions\u2014 the Heights' residential and collegiate culture and the Square's progressive urban focus. At that time, a decision was also made to build aggressively for quality\u2014to recruit the very best faculty and students, to update and expand the physical plant, and to create distin - guished programs both here and abroad. In recent years, the College has become recognized as a national leader for its efforts to reinvent a liberal arts education for the 21st century. With a challenging liberal arts foundation, the College Core Curriculum, at the center of the undergraduate experience, the College emphasizes student inquiry and research, offers unique opportunities for international and pre-professional study, and makes use of the city as a site for learning and service. A liberal arts education thus reconceived is not only personally enriching but also eminently practical in developing the skills and perspectives essential to assume a lead - ership role in the 21st century. The Col - lege continues to build on its founders' goal of providing \"Useful Knowledge.\" A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE College of Arts & Science The history of the College of Arts & Science begins with the founding of the University by a number of prominent New Yorkers, led by Albert Gallatin, a member of Jefferson's cabinet. Unlike other institutions at the time, it was to be nonsectarian and to produce a different sort of elite citizen, not born to privilege but set apart for leadership by talent and effort. To that end, it provided a more practical education, what the 19th century called \"Useful Knowledge.\"Gene A.

Through a challenging array of courses, the College Core Curriculum heightens cultural awareness, hones critical reading skills, and promotes creative and logical thinking. It also gives students extensive practice writing and speaking English and proficiency in at least one other language. Rather than specifying a fixed canon of knowledge, Core courses focus on modes and methods of humanistic and scientific inquiry. In each case, students are free to pursue particular interests by choosing among a number of courses. Students examine our contemporary culture\u2014its origins and social structures, its modes of expression, and its inherent diversity and evolving patterns of thought. In other classes, they consider the place and importance of modern science\u2014its quantitative and analytical foundations, its processes of reasoning, and its relationship to technology and to our views of the natural world. By helping them to broaden their perspectives, gain new pathways for intellectual inquiry, and develop the skills, background, and social awareness to thrive in dynamic circumstances, the Core Curriculum seeks to prepare students for their later studies and to equip them well for lives as thinking individuals and members of society. n The College Core Curriculum has five components: 1. The First-Year Seminar 2. Study of a foreign language 3. The Expository Writing Program 4. Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) 5. Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) Though structured and integrated, the Core Curriculum affords students flexibility in a number of ways. It permits the choice of different tracks in each component, the satisfaction of some cours - es by examination or Advanced Placement (or equivalent international) credit (foreign language, FSI), and the substitution of departmental courses (FSI, Societies and the Social Sciences in FCC). Given this flexibility, students work individually with advisers to plan course schedules that take into account their past preparation, current interests, and longer-term goals. While there is no prescribed schedule of courses that will be appropriate for every student, the following broad guidelines should be kept in mind:PROGRAM 20 Incoming freshmen should complete their Core courses by the end of sophomore year. This will leave them free in their junior and senior years to focus on their major and elective courses. Some science majors, engineering students, prehealth students, and students placed in the International Writing Workshop sequence may need to delay starting, and thus finishing, a component of the Core Curriculum for a semester or more. Students who study away may also need to delay completing their Core courses beyond the sophomore year. Students must complete Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1) during their first year. Those placed into the Liberal Studies Writing or International Writing Workshop sequences must begin in their first semester and must register for their remaining writing course(s) in the semester(s) immediately following. In designing the College Core Curriculum, the faculty sought to ensure that all students would receive a broad exposure to the liberal arts early in their college careers. With this wide academic horizon, the Core Curriculum encourages students to discover new intellectual interests outside their intended areas of specialization and to pursue those interests with elective courses outside their majors in their later undergraduate years. The First-Year Seminar The College of Arts and Science's First-Year Seminar program, a graduation requirement, has long been the centerpiece of students' first-year academic experience in the College. Within a small classroom setting, students are exposed to college-level academic content and expectations that form the basis of a liberal arts education. By engaging with their peers and faculty in dynamic critical thinking, writing, and presentation activities, students gain core skills and research competencies that lay the foundation for success during their NYU experience and beyond. First-Year Seminars also connect students to the rich academic and cultural resources of NYU and New York City, from museums to the theatre to libraries and archives, and their small size fosters close work between students and instructors. The seminars encourage our students to develop\u2014 beginning with their very first semester in the College\u2014as critical assessors of existing knowledge as well as of new ideas and approaches, and they equip CAS students with the skills and habits of mind they need to succeed at NYU and beyond. First-Year Seminars are offered in both the fall and spring terms; students may take the requirement in either term. The selection of seminars varies from year to year, and the program aims to represent all three curricular divisions of Arts and Science (the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences). See the section on First-Year Seminars in this Bulletin. Foreign Language The study of foreign languages is an integral part of a liberal arts education. It nurtures an awareness of the diversity of human culture and serves the practical need for language skills in fields such as government, business, and research. New York University is a particularly exciting setting for language study because of its location in a great cosmopolitan city, its international student body, its many renowned language programs and centers, and its numerous opportunities for study away. In addition to the foreign language courses offered for academic credit, the College offers opportu - nities for students of modern languages to practice their skills in real-world situations outside the classroom. NYU Speaking Freely is a free, noncredit program that allows students to practice their speaking and aural comprehension skills and to explore the linguistically diverse cultures of New York City. For more information about this popular program, contact the Office of the Associate Dean The College Core Curriculum / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 21 for Students, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 909; speakingfreely.cas.nyu. edu. Increasingly, college graduates must be prepared to function in a global society. Apart from the inherent interest of learning about other cultures, many NYU students take the opportunity tostudy or travel abroad as preparation for their future careers. For more information about study away programs, visit the Office of Global Programs, 383 Lafayette Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10003; 212-998-4433; nyu.edu/academics/studying-abroad ; and also consult the study away section of this Bulletin. REQUIREMENT To fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum, students must demon - strate or attain proficiency in a foreign language through the full intermediate level. Ordinarily, this is accomplished by the successful completion of two years of language study in the College, through the second semester of a regular intermediate-level language sequence. Some languages are also taught as intensive courses, allowing students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year. After two years of college language study or the equivalent demonstrated proficiency, students should have gained a broad competence in a language, but true fluency of written or oral expression will not usually have been developed at this point. For this reason, all students are encouraged to continue their language study beyond the intermediate level. In particular, students studying modern languages will find it most beneficial to immerse themselves in the living culture of a language by studying, traveling, or working abroad. Likewise, students of all languages, whether ancient or modern, are encouraged to continue their studies with elective courses in literature at the advanced level. EXEMPTIONS Students may fulfill the foreign language component of the College Core Curriculum by presenting outstanding scores on the SAT Subject Test or Advanced Placement Test (or equivalent interna - tional examination) in certain foreign languages, or by passing a CAS or departmental proficiency examination. For further information on language placement and exemption, see \"placement examinations\" in the academic policies section of this Bulletin. For Advanced Placement and international examination equivalencies, consult the charts in the admission section, also in this Bulletin. Students whose entire secondary schooling was in a language other than English, or who complete the International Writing Workshop I, II sequence (EXPOS-UA 4, 9), are exempt from the foreign language requirement. Also exempt are students in the dual-degree engineering program. COURSES Listed below are courses covering the second semester of the intermediate level of language study. Intensive courses, which allow students to complete the equivalent of two years of study in a single year, are also listed where available. Completion of any of the following courses will fulfill the foreign language requirement. Please consult the individual departmental listings for information on prerequisite courses.

For more information on specific language classes, placement, or exemption, please contact the language coordinator, director of language programs, or director of undergraduate studies named in the individual departmental sections in this Bulletin. Thanks to an exchange arrangement with Columbia University, students may also enroll in the following languages, often (but not always) offered through the intermediate level and given at Columbia: Armenian, Bengali, Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian, Burmese, Catalan, Czech, Dutch, Finnish, Hungarian, Indonesian, Khmer, Ottoman Turkish, Polish, Punjabi, Romanian, Sanskrit, Sinhala, Swahili, Swedish, Tamil, Modern Tibetan, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Wolof, Yoruba, and Zulu. For information about these courses, visit the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 908; 212-998-8110. Not every language is offered at Columbia every semester. Expository Writing The practice of including writing in the Core Curriculum reflects NYU's longstanding commitment to the centrality of written inquiry to undergraduate education. Expository writing courses at NYU teach students to move from answering teachers' question to identifying and responding to questions and problems that they themselves identify. To this end, students learn to use writing as a flexible tool for exploring ideas, taking intellectual and creative risks, analyzing data (sources, text, visual material, and empirical data), making and rethinking observations, and investigating The College Core Curriculum / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 23 questions and curiosities. Students also learn to think of writing as a process of consciously crafting a text that purposefully communicates an idea, finding, result, insight, or interpretation to a specific imagined audience. Most students fulfill the expository writing component of the Core through completion of Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1). Subject to proficiency recommendations, some international students may be placed in the two-semester sequence International Writing Workshop I and II (EXPOS-UA 4 and 9). A number of advanced elective courses are also available. For a complete description of the program and its course offerings, see the Expository Writing Program section of this Bulletin. Foundations of Contemporary Culture The Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum is a series of four coordinated courses in the humanities and social sciences. Within each of the four offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. Overall, the structure of the FCC ensures that every student in the College gains a common core of skills and experiences in the liberal arts. In addition to the information on the FCC sequence provided in this Bulletin, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website. TEXTS AND IDEAS Texts and Ideas introduces students to the ideals of liberal education and the central role of humanistic study in the liberal arts and fosters appreciation of the importance of humanistic learning for society at large. Students become acquainted with some of the literary and philo - sophical works that have been most influential in shaping the contemporary world and with significant instances in which the ideas in these works have been debated, developed, appropri - ated, or rejected. Texts and Ideas is not a survey but, rather, an examination of how texts influence subsequent thinking, create traditions, and reflect societal ideals. Texts and Ideas thus aims to provide a richer understanding of how cultures are constructed, modified, and represented. CULTURES AND CONTEXTS Cultures and Contexts prepares students for life in a globalized world by introducing them to the ways in which humans come to understand themselves as members of social, religious, national, and regional collectives and by fostering their appreciation of the dynamics of cultural interaction and influence. Individual sections focus on specific social or cultural groups different from the dominant traditions of contemporary North America. They share a common concern to examine the ways cultures have interacted, for example, through trade, colonization, immigration, religious dispersion, and media representation; how such groups define themselves against internal and external difference; and how the dominant perspective of Western modernity affects compre - hension of the ways in which people outside that position understand, experience, and imagine their lives. Offerings include emergent traditions, diaspora formations, and societies understood as nation - ally, geographically, or culturally distinct from the dominant traditions of contemporary North America. Courses focusing on ancient civilizations are also included, as are courses that address contemporary challenges to traditional European conceptions of national identity. SOCIETIES AND THE SOCIAL SCIENCES Over the past several centuries, enormous social transformations have taken place around the The College Core Curriculum / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 24 world. To understand the complexity of these phenomena, new methods have been developed to study societal structures and human behavior. Each of the courses under Societies and the Social Sciences begins from a particular disciplinary approach, social concern, or topic, in order to orient students to the characteristic methods of these social sciences. Students learn how issues are objectified for study, how data are collected and analyzed, and how new understanding is thereby achieved. Whether through an interdisciplinary approach, consideration of their historical development, or reflection on critical and positivistic debates, the courses help students both to appreciate the unique insights afforded by these methods and to recognize the limits of such inquiry. In this way, students move beyond the particular focus of the class to a broader under - standing of methods and problems in the social sciences generally. EXPRESSIVE CULTURE In Expressive Culture, students explore the complexities of artistic expression in various media: sounds, images, words, performance, or film. Each course introduces requisite historical, formal, and critical vocabularies; examines fundamental issues associated with interpretation of the arts making use of these media; and investigates the complex relations between artistic activity and other facets of social organization. The courses also make use, whenever possible, of the rich cultural resources of New York City. Foundations of Scientific Inquiry The Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) component of the College Core Curriculum is a series of three coordinated courses in quantitative reasoning and the natural sciences. Together, these courses ensure that every student in the College gains a fundamental understanding of how mathematics and laboratory experimentation advance scientific investigation. While some students acquire this background through course work offered in the science majors and the prehealth track, FSI courses are especially designed to meet the needs of nonscience students. Within each of the three offerings, students are free to pursue their particular interests through their choice of individual classes. In addition to the information on the FSI provided in this Bulletin, detailed descriptions of each year's course offerings may be found on the Core Curriculum website. QUANTITATIVE REASONING Students in Quantitative Reasoning engage mathematical concepts in a variety of contexts in the natural or social sciences. All courses include a substantial amount of problem solving that requires both conceptual and computational work. PHYSICAL SCIENCE Scientific knowledge has its basis in our natural curiosity about the world around us and our place in it. These courses approach the physical sciences with the intent of asking and trying to answer interesting questions, dealing with topics ranging from the origin of our universe and planet to how human activity affects our environment. Students consider the important roles played by laws of physics and chemistry in biology, earth and environmental sciences, astrophysics, and cosmology; they also develop an understanding of how the physical sciences inform the natural sciences generally. Mathematics is introduced in each course with frequent applications to the subject matter. Predictions that can be made only with the use of mathematics are clearly delineated, showing the powerful role it plays in our understanding of the universe. Wherever possible, the courses relate science to societal problems and develop a historical perspective. The College Core Curriculum / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 25 LIFE SCIENCE The complexity of the biological realm continues to fascinate and challenge modern scientists, who are currently engaged in such diverse pursuits as exploring the organization and function of the brain, reconstructing the origin of the human species, linking the multiplicity of interactions in ecosystems, and deciphering the influence of heredity on complex traits. The courses in Life Science take a nontraditional approach to the life sciences, with an emphasis on approaching science as a dynamic process of investigation and discovery. Each course selects a broad theme that is at the forefront of contemporary research, then uses specific questions and examples to introduce students to the methodology of scientific inquiry, the critical evaluation of results, and the mathe - matical tools used to quantify scientific information.

The seminars typically range in size from 16 to 17 students. First-Year Seminars are offered in both the fall and spring terms. Students may take the requirement in either term. The students from two thematically linked seminars are grouped together into an advising cohort of approximately 32 to 34 students, who meet as a group with their CAS academic adviser several times during both the fall and spring terms of the first year. The selection of seminars varies from year to year, and the program aims to represent all three curricular divisions of Arts and Science (the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences). Students may always find the most up-to-date offerings and descriptions at cas.nyu. edu/academic-programs/first-year-seminars . Substitutions Any CAS student who does not creditably complete this graduation requirement in the first year is still responsible for it, and must make up the requirement by taking a reading- and writing-in - tensive course (coded as a seminar in Albert) in any CAS department (it cannot be a course in the College Core Curriculum). In these circumstances, the student must file a petition with the PROGRAM 27 Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards requesting the substitution; petition forms are available at cas.nyu.edu/academic-standards or in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 909; 212-998-8140. COURSES This is a sampling of recent seminars in the program. Except when noted, First-Year Seminars never assume any specific course or background on the student's part. Language and Reality in 20th-Century Science and Literature FRSEM-UA 210 Ulfers. 4 points. Posits a common ground between the two cultures of science and the humanities and proposes a correlation between postclassical science (e.g., quantum theory) and \"postmodern\" literature and philosophy. Examines Heisenberg's \"uncertainty principle\" and the \"undecidability\" of deconstructive theory. The discussion of these notions and their implications in literary works focuses on their effect on classical logic, the referential function of language, and the traditional goal of a complete explanation/description of reality. Supreme Court and the Religion Clauses: Religion and State in America FYSEM-UA 218 Sexton. 4 points. Should members of the Native American Church be allowed to smoke peyote at religious ceremonies? Can a public high school invite a rabbi to give a benedic - tion and convocation at graduation? Should a state legislator rely on his or her religious convictions in forming a view about the legality of capital punishment or abortion? We divide these questions into three subject areas: religious liberty; separation of church and state; and the role of religion in public and political life. Focuses on how the Supreme Court has dealt with these areas and, more important, invites students to construct anew a vision of the proper relationship between religion, state, and society in a twenty-first-cen - tury liberal constitutional democracy. Latin America at the Start of the 21st Century: Coming of Age or Continuing Chaos? FYSEM-UA 306 Casta\u00f1eda. 4 points. Focuses on longstanding problems and possible solutions to them. Topics include the absence of orderly, peaceful, and steady democratic governance following independence from colonial rule, and the consolidation of represen - tative democracy today; the slowdown of economic growth in the last 20 years and prospects for a new economic takeoff; the phenomenon of widespread violence at a time of growing respect for human rights; and how the traditional weakness of civil society is being over- come. For each topic, there are readings dealing with its political, economic, and cultural dimensions in both past and present. Journalism of War, Revolution, Genocide, and Human Rights FYSEM-UA 384 Linfield. 4 points . We read some of the key journalistic works on these topics that have been written in the past one hundred years. How, and why, has the nature of war changed in the past century? Why do some revolutions, such as those in Eastern Europe after the fall of Communism, largely succeed, while others, such as those of the Arab Spring, fail so miserably? Why do sufferers of violence and oppression so often become perpetrators of it? What is the difference between war and genocide, and why did the latter emerge in the 20th century? Why has terrorism re-emerged with such vengeance in the past two decades? What are \"human rights\"\u2014another invention of the 20th century\u2014and how, if at all, have they become a reality? Science and Policy of Climate Change FYSEM-UA 432 Gerber. 4 points. Recent years have been the warmest in recorded history. It is likely the hottest the Earth has ever been since the last interglacial period 125,000 years ago. The first predictions of human-induced global warming were made over a century ago, but the topic remains controversial despite the fact that the world has warmed almost 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the intervening years. Investigates observational evidence as well as the physical and mathematical foundations upon which forecasts of future climate are based. Armed with a scientific and policy background, students conduct a research project on the response to global warming\u2014 delving into the details of climate engi - neering, alternate energy, psychology, ethics, and/or economics\u2014thus giving them a chance to enter the debate, and perhaps even contribute to the solution. What is College For? FRSEM-UA 474 Jordan. 4 points. Why did you decide to attend college? To broaden your intellectual horizons and become open-minded? To gain CAS First- Y ear Seminar Program / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 28 28 specialized knowledge in a specific subject? To achieve a financially reward - ing career? To satisfy your parents? At the beginning of the twenty-first century, current models and practices of higher education are receiving increased scrutiny. Topics for discussion: Does higher education need to redefine its academic mission? Should everyone attend college? What is the impact of new technologies? How can students, professors, and administrators all con - tribute to creating a successful college environment? Global Citizenship: Podcasting Global Issues FYSEM-UA 484 Baer. 4 points. Do all people, cultures, and countries value freedom, justice, and personal autonomy in the same way\u2014or do some strike a different balance between protecting individuals while maintaining the common good? Globalization, which describes both the current state of interdependence among people and a mindset that tries to account for everyone on the planet, brings these questions into sharp relief. New York City is a perfect place to test whether there are indeed universal values and how different people who hold disparate values and follow diverse rules can live together. Students produce episodes for the podcast Think About It , dedicated to in-depth conversations on big ideas. They learn how to prepare for intelli - gent interviews through background research; how to outline questions; how to professionally record someone; and how to edit, format, and upload interviews as professional podcasts. Cultural Nature of Language FYSEM-UA 496 Schieffelin. 4 points. Whether it's accents, pronouns, swearing, or spelling, how one uses language is never value-free. Examines language use as a social practice, and analyzes how speakers and their language(s) are evaluated and regulated across a range of contexts and cultures. Starting with how children learn to talk, or don't (e.g., feral children), considers speech and silence across a range of societies. Looks at popular attitudes toward language and the practices by which people regulate its use in the media (e.g., political correctness), in legal and educational institutions (e.g., \"English only\"), and in multilingual cities (e.g., Barcelona, Montreal) in order to understand how ideas about language are often recruited to non-linguistic concerns, such as who should be included and who excluded. Critically explores issues of identity and authority. Work and Family in the New Economy FYSEM-UA 500 Gerson. 4 points. The rise of a globalized \"new economy\" has created jobs with more short-term flexibility but less long-term security. In a parallel way, the rise of more diverse options in intimate relationships has created similar uncertainties in the nature of commitments to partners and children. Taken together, these revolutionary shifts have left recent generations facing deepening conflicts between earning a living and caring for others. To explore the causes, contours, and longer-term consequences of these changes in economic and private life, we first study cutting-edge research on these contemporary trends and, second, draw on these readings as students develop and conduct original research projects on a relevant topic of their choice. In Search of Lost Time FRSEM-UA 503 Clements. 4 points. We read Proust (in translation) as he should be read: hedonistically\u2014with respect and admiration but also with delectation. A prodigious novel of more than 4,000 pages, In Search of Lost Time is still unparalleled in how it com - bines finesse and wit with raw emotion, self-examination with social history, profound psychological acuity with a dazzling portrait of the French beau monde at the outset of modernity, and how it merges an audacious explosion of literary form with explorations of memory, desire, attachment, deception, lust, jealousy, ambition, and disappoint - ment. We move at a brisk pace through the entire work (reading assignments average 350 pages per week). Xenophon of Athens FYSEM-UA 514 Renzi. 4 points. The greatest ancient you've never heard of, Xenophon of Athens (c. 425-355 B.C.E.) was a brilliant general, a student of Socrates, and a renowned author. When knowledge of Greek was still required for admission to college, his fame was ubiquitous, as his writings formed the basis of the college prepa - ratory curriculum. Particular attention is given to Xenophon's literary style and technique, his invention of new literary genres and innovations as a writer of Socratic discourses, and issues of adap - tation, as well as to his characterization of Socrates, depictions of women and non-Greek peoples and slaves, theory of leadership, and political thought. Readings, in English translation: Apology of Socrates, Symposium, Memorabilia, Cyropaedia, Cavalry Commander, Anab - asis, and the film based on the latter, The Warriors \u2014with a CAS connection\u2014 set in 1979 C.E. New York City. Facing Fascism: The Spanish Civil War and U.S. Culture FRSEM-UA 539 Prerequisite: Advanced Placement examination credit in Spanish, or in U .S. or World History. Fern\u00e1ndez. 4 points. The West is in the grip of the Great Depression, and liberal democracy is in crisis. On the rise: a spectrum of CAS First- Y ear Seminar Program / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 29 29 ideologies ranging from anarchism to fascism. July 1936: a right-wing military coup attempts to overthrow a democratically elected left-wing coalition government, and all eyes turn toward Spain. We conduct research in NYU's Abraham Lincoln Brigade Archives (ALBA), a vast collection of materials that chronicles the lives of the 2,800 Americans who, between 1936 and 1939, volunteered to fight fascism in Spain. We explore the place occu - pied by Spain and the Spanish Civil War in American culture from the 1930s forward and how journalists, writers, artists, and citizens reacted to the war in Spain. After the End: Post-Apocalypse Novels in the 20th and 21st Centuries FYSEM-UA 598 Hoover. 4 points. Many authors have speculated about what would happen if (most) humans were destroyed. Authors have removed humans by natural disasters, or have imagined alien invasions, plagues, epidemics, agricultural collapses, and reproductive failure. More recently, humans themselves have become popular as causes of apocalypses because global thermonuclear war, lethal pollution, disastrous over-popu - lation, genetic engineering, and climate change have become realistic possible scenarios for the collapse of our species. We pay special attention to apoca - lypses that have implications for the nature of humanity and human society. Some treat an apocalypse as a kind of thought-experiment; some focus more on the collapse of human institutions, culture, morality, and religion; others on the challenges the survivors face; and still others address the potential for the re-creation of human society or the creation of an alternative kind of society.#BlackLanguageMatters FYSEM-UA 634 Blake. 4 points. The many ways African Americans use language to express their personal and community identities. We study the linguistic structure of African American English and theories about its origins. We explore how language is used to convey social identity\u2014particularly regarding race and ethnicity\u2014and make meaning of one's life. Issues addressed include language variation, language contact and change, and social and linguistic discrimination. Finally, we consider African American English as a nexus of ideas on race, identity, sexual - ity, violence, and equality in the United States and abroad, with reference to Cornel West's Race Matters (1994) and the more recent #BlackLivesMatter movement . Adventures in Interviewing: Oral History Theory and Practice FYSEM-UA 701 Nyhan Grey. 4 points. Oral history is compelling in its ability to bring forward the voices of those who were frequently excluded from more typical sources and it often leads to new interpretations of history. As a method it presents both challenges and rewards, as the sources are not confined to the library or an archive. In the process of interviewing, the historian is confronted by sources that speak, think, remember, forget, and recount\u2014human beings. Explores theories of memory, how memory is constructed and forgotten, and how historians contend with this type of source. Preparing for and con - ducting an oral history interview will be a significant portion of students' work. Crystallization in Life: Stories about Shells, Bones, and Kidney Stones FYSEM-UA 714 Prerequisites: Advanced Placement examination credit in Chemistry, and in either Calculus or Biology. An. 4 points. Introduces the world of biomineraliza - tion, the branch of chemistry that deals with crystal formation under the influ - ence of biomolecules. Studies the fundamentals of crystal formation, crystal properties, and the structure of crystals surrounding us. Begins with solution chemistry, crystallization theory, and various aspects of the crystalliza - tion process in nature and then moves on to the specific case studies of the title, with attention to biomolecules (proteins, lipids, etc.) and their roles in controlling the crystallization process. Understanding the biomineralization process in the formation of kidney stones can lead to preventative drug development, which illustrates a practical application of the field in biomedical science. In addition, studying the crys - tallization process in nature can lead to new bioinspired materials, such as optical fibers. Nature vs. Nurture: The Neurobiology of Individuality FYSEM-UA 732 Kaplow. 4 points. Psychologists, biologists, philosophers, and neuroscientists have historically questioned the impact of heredity vs. the environment in shaping the unique - ness of individuals. Modern scientists have arrived at a consensus whereby both genes and experience contribute to distinct behaviors. Indeed, \"nature\" and \"nurture\" are not isolated compo - nents. Understanding the constant and complex interaction between the two is the key to unlocking the mysteries of animal and human behaviors. We examine the nature vs. nurture debate over time by studying Darwin and Lamarck, as well as novel genetic tools that explore the interaction between DNA and the environment and papers treating the topic of genes and behav - ior. Students write research papers on topics and in a style accessible to the general public. CAS First- Y ear Seminar Program / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 30 30 Heroic Journeys: Homer, Vergil, , and Dante's Inferno span two millennia and very different cultures\u2014archaic Greece at the dawn of literature, pagan Rome of the first century B.C.E., and Flor - ence during the Christian Middle Ages. Reflecting very different social, political, and religious values, they explore very different visions of what it means to be human, particularly with regard to the individual's role in society and the individual's relationship to the divine. But for all their differences, the three poems self-consciously engage with one another, building on, competing with, and correcting their predecessors' visions. Thus, all are cast as journeys by a hero, and these journeys are both literal and metaphorical. All three also involve a descent into the underworld, from which the hero is, in a sense, reborn with a greater understanding and a new sense of purpose. Emphasizes close reading and discussion of the three poems, as well as development of research skills. Seeing the Universe FYSEM-UA 758 Weiner. 4 points. The universe is full of stuff, but our abil - ity to see it is quite limited. We aim to understand the limits of our perception, and how and what we humans have done to see beyond it. In short, we will discuss the universe we can see, how we see it, and how we see the universe we cannot. This will include how we see with light, and what we can see with different forms of light. We will discuss other ways of seeing, including relying on neutrinos and gravity. We will discuss how we can see things from the early universe; how we see things like dark matter; and whether it makes sense to talk about things we cannot see, such as beyond the observable universe. Along the way, we will develop a basic picture of the history of the cosmos.

Africa's own overlapping modernities and the transnational migrations of its peoples\u2014whether forced or voluntary\u2014have complicated the meanings of \"black\" and \"African\" identities and experiences, prompting us to rethink the geographical boundaries and conceptual paradigms surrounding the production of knowledge about Africa and its diasporic communities in the 21st century. Accordingly, the program is a site for cross-cultural teaching and research in the histories, cultures, economies, politics, and practices of African Diasporas in Africa, the Americas (North and South), the Caribbean, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region, and the Middle East. NYU's study away center in Ghana offers a rare opportunity for undergraduates to study in Africa. A range of Africana studies courses has been developed and is offered at NYU Accra (visit nyu.edu/accra ). The program maintains close relationships with the community programming and research activities of NYU's Institute of African-American Affairs and Africa House. Africana studies offers programs leading to B.A., B.A./M.A., and M.A. degrees, as well as a suite of joint M.A. programs with journalism, economics, and museum studies. n Major The Africana studies major requires nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better. 32 Two introductory courses\u2014may be taken in either order: Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101) Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534), but only when taught by SCA faculty Six elective courses: Six designated Africana studies electives, of which four must be taught by SCA faculty. SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program (SCA-UA 42) is no longer required but is highly recommended and can count as an elective; one African language course can count as an elective if taught by SCA faculty. One research course: Advanced Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90) Minor Five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better are required for the minor in Africana studies. Students must take Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534), but only when taught by SCA faculty. They also take four designated Africana studies elective courses, of which two must be taught by SCA faculty. One African language course can count as an elective if taught by SCA faculty. Language and Linguistic Competency The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within and across different social groups. Studying the modern incarnation of these languages also reveals the cross-cultural and historical forces that have shaped them. The department there - fore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in Swahili, Twi, Yoruba, and/or any of the indigenous languages spoken in Africa, or creole languages (e.g., Haitian Creole) spoken throughout the African Diaspora. This can be achieved by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying these languages beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research away, especially at the NYU Accra site, in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. Policy on Double Counting of Courses Majors may share (double count) two courses with a second major, with permission from the other department/program. Honors Program Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year. Upon successful completion of the seminar require - ment, students will be eligible to register for Senior Honors Thesis (SCA-UA 93) in the spring.

Africana Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 33 Introductory Core Social and Cultural Analysis 101 SCA-UA 101 Offered every year. 4 points. Introduces theories, methods, and polit - ical trajectories central to the Depart - ment of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA). SCA addresses how individuals and populations structure their worlds and navigate the resulting social, cul - tural, and political terrain. It privileges scholarly work with an intersectional approach, drawing on theoretical insights from such fields as social geography, feminism and queer studies, ethnic studies, urban and metropolitan studies, critical race theory, labor stud - ies, and cultural studies. Please note that the following CORE-UA course counts as introductory only when offered by SCA faculty. Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic CORE-UA 534 Offered every fall. 4 points. See description under College Core Curriculum in this Bulletin. Research Core Advanced Research Seminar SCA-UA 90 Prerequisite: Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101) or Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534). Offered every semester. 4 points. Students write a 20-25 page research paper with a focus on a specific research method. Topics vary by semester; see Albert for details. Honors Program Senior Honors Seminar SCA-UA 92 Prerequisites: 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major), Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101), The Black Atlantic (CORE-UA 534), and permission of the department. Offered every fall. 4 points. Senior Honors Thesis SCA-UA 93 Prerequisites: Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92), 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major), and permission of the department. Offered every spring. 4 points. SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program The 4-point internship program comple - ments and enhances the formal course work of the Africana studies major. Students intern at agencies dealing with a range of issues pertaining to Africana studies and take a corequisite seminar that enables them to focus the work experience in meaningful academic terms. The goals of the internship are threefold: (1) to allow students to apply the theory they have gained through course work, (2) to provide students with analytical tools, and (3) to assist students in exploring professional career paths. The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an interview and permission of the department. SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program SCA-UA 42 Requires ten hours a week of fieldwork. Offered every spring. 4 points. Elective Courses Race, Football, and American Culture SCA-UA 153 4 points. The evolution of American football into a mirror of black life and politics and a reflection of race relations in American culture. Student writing and research explores the growth of football as a vehicle and model for black protest and support for movements such as Black Lives Matter. Attendance at two football games is required. The Black Body and the Lens SCA-UA 155 4 points. Explores the range of ideas and methods used by critical thinkers in addressing the body in photography, video, music, and film. Considers the construction of beauty, gendered images, race, and hip-hop culture. The historical gaze and the interplay between the historical and the contemporary, between self-presen - tation and imposed representation, are fundamental to our discussions. Final projects include an imaging project and/ or a written essay. Hip Hop and Politics SCA-UA 157 4 points. Besides realizing the worst fears of a previous generation who placed its hopes in the aspirations of 60s-era social movements, this new generation's fashion sensibilities, technological savvy, and strategies for commodifying blackness suggest a demographic now more concerned with the economics of globalization than the political economy of race. We interrogate the specific generational tensions that structure popular and intellectual discourses concerning the \"hip-hop generation\" and the perceived demise of contempo - rary black politics. Race and Reproduction SCA-UA 158 4 points. Examines the connections between gender, racial ideology, and history of medicine to consider the range of ways that reproduction\u2014medically, culturally, and experientially\u2014produces and troubles racial ideology. Cross-cul - 33 COURSES Africana Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 34 34 tural breadth will help us to consider the relationship between biological experiences (which are often portrayed as universal) and socio-cultural context. We locate biology within a wider set of issues around social reproduction and the practices of motherhood, and both illuminate and problematize the connec - tions between technologies and politics of biology and difference. The Postcolonial City SCA-UA 166 4 points. Uses ethnographic, sociological, histor - ical, and literary texts to theorize the Afrodiasporic city and urban experience. Explores the contours of these urban matrices through special attention to historical categories that prepare us to theorize the way Afrodiasporic popula - tions have experienced and lived history (e.g., the precolonial, the colonial, and the postcolonial). Considers the histor - ical emergence of the Third World as not simply a broad rubric for African and Asian postcolonies, but instead as a project to reverse the course of European exploitation. Topics in Africana Studies SCA-UA 180 4 points. Explores specific issues dealing with the black urban experience, focusing on social and cultural institutions. Possible themes, which vary from semester to semester, include class and poverty, the police, urban development, education, sports, music, and art. Independent Study SCA-UA 197, 198 Prerequisite: permission of the program director.

The adviser for the minor is responsible for ensuring that each student's program of study remains coherent and logical, although there is considerable flexibility within the bounds of the requirements. Courses may be selected that deal with different periods and methodological approaches, as well as a variety of geographical areas that the requirements demand. Each student's course of study is designed on an individual basis, in accordance with his or her needs and interests. A number of CAS departments and programs, as well as institutes and centers, are directly involved in this program: anthropology, art history, classics, comparative literature, East Asian studies, English, Hebrew and Judaic studies, history, Irish studies, linguistics, Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, and the Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies. The minor consists of five 4-point courses, which are normally selected from the appropriate offerings of these departments and programs. All five of the courses selected must be offered by departments other than the student's major department, and no more than two may be taken in any one department. Students are furthermore expected to examine at least three different civilizations or cultures in completing this minor. Language courses may not be used to fulfill the requirements of this minor. If desired, students who choose this minor may complete, as a capstone experience, an independent study course, which is normally the fifth course taken for the minor. The adviser for the ancient studies minor may assist students in designing a project and in finding an appropriate faculty member to direct this independent study.

The department considers its greatest assets to be the various individual areas of faculty expertise: archaeological specialties such as medieval archaeology and European, Near Eastern, and South Asian prehistory; biological anthropology areas such as molecular primatology, primate behavioral ecology, and paleoanthropology; linguistic anthropology foci such as discourse analysis and language social - ization; and sociocultural anthropology specialties such as the ethnography of North America, Africa, India, China, the Near and Middle East, Russia and the former Soviet Union, the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Australia, and the South Pacific. Major theoretical emphasis is on the systems of thought and symbolic representation of the self and society; the relation between female and male domains of interaction; changing patterns of social organization and hierarchy within small-scale societies, urban settings, and bureaucratic institutions; medical anthropology; evolutionary approaches to the study of primate and human origins; religion; art; science studies; race and ethnicity; and the problem of ethnographic representation in film and other media. Departmental resources include an extensive film and video collection as well as teaching and research labs for archaeology, linguistic anthropology, and biological anthropology, which can be used for research by advanced undergraduates. A departmental colloquium series and an undergraduate student association welcome undergraduate participation. The department participates in the University's Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies, the Jordan Center for the Advanced Study of Russia, the Institute for French Studies, the Center for Religion and Media, the Center for the Study of Human Origins, the Institute for Study of the Ancient World, the Program in Museum Studies, and the Center for Media, Culture, and History. Formal and informal cooperative arrangements with museums, zoos, and other academic institutions in the greater New York area place at students' disposal a group of anthropological scholars, materials, and resources unparalleled in the country. n Professors Emeriti Beidelman, Disotell, Jolly, Martin, Rosaldo, WrightDavid B.

Sociocultural anthropology is interdisciplinary in orientation, analyzing and synthesizing religious, artistic, economic, and political practices through the common medium of culture. Traditionally, cultural anthropology emphasized the study of small-scale societies in non-Western settings. Contemporary sociocultural anthropology maintains such interests but increasingly applies its insights and methods to urban and industrialized societies and attends more closely to the production of culture. An emphasis of the department is the ethnographic study of cultural, social, and political processes that shape our lives and those of other people, especially as we are drawn together and influence one another in increasingly transnational and global interactions. Linguistic anthropology focuses on how language is interpreted and used in cultural contexts. Language use is socially organized, and it is a key to understanding the ways in which speakers create and change social realities. Studied within historical as well as cultural frameworks and in relation to other social institutions (e.g., politics, education, law, medicine), variation in ways of speaking language(s) adds to our understanding of how social categories such as ethnicity, race, and gender are interactionally constituted across contexts, cultures, and societies. Archaeological anthropology uses artifacts and other material remains to understand human culture. It attempts to breathe life into a material record that at first glance appears static and fragmentary. The research interests of anthropological archaeologists range from the earliest production of durable tools 3.3 million years ago to the refuse currently being generated by modern cities. All aspects of past human existence, including art, technology, religion, gender, economic and social organization, and food-getting strategies, are addressed by researchers in anthropological archaeology. Biological anthropology encompasses the study of human and nonhuman primate biological diversity and includes the anatomy, genetics, behavior, ecology, and evolution of humans and other primates. It is linked to the other subfields of anthropology by its commitment to the study of human biology, behavior, and evolution within the context of culture, society, and ecology. Close ties with the American Museum of Natural History and the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo facilitate the department's diverse research interests in biological anthropology. Departmental Objectives Anthropology courses contribute to undergraduate education in two ways. First, the scope of the discipline's interests bridges the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences. Anthropology asks basic questions concerning the origins and development of humans and their cultures and divergent systems of thought, belief, and social order. By systematically analyzing various cultural traditions\u2014contemporary as well as historically known\u2014anthropology raises critical questions concerning the foundations of world civilizations. An understanding of the distinctive way anthropology formulates and attempts to answer its basic questions is a necessary component of a comprehensive liberal arts education.PROGRAM Anthropology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 47 Second, the department offers concentrated programs of study for the minor, major, or honors student. A minor usually emphasizes one of the four subdisciplines, although students are free to select courses from across the subfields. For the major, the department encourages study in all of the subdisciplines, because each supplements and complements the others in presenting humans as both biological and social beings. The honors program includes in-depth research and writing in an aspect of sociocultural, linguistic, archaeological, or biological anthropology, as well as the pursuit of additional advanced course work at the senior undergraduate and graduate level. The director of undergraduate studies (DUS) works closely with anthropology majors and minors in designing programs of study that integrate their individual goals with the offerings and intellec - tual goals of the department and complementary disciplines. Majors should meet with the DUS at least once per semester, typically just prior to registration for the next semester, to discuss their progress through the program, decide on future course work, and discuss post-graduation plans. The department prides itself on its graduate and undergraduate programs' integrated nature, which enables major, minor, and honors students to participate in a variety of challenging graduate courses and seminars. Additionally, an active Anthropology Undergraduate Student Association (AUSA) connects students to one another through special events and an e-mail forum. Major in Anthropology The major in anthropology consists of nine 4-point courses (36 points), which include the following four required courses (16 points): Culture, Power, Society (formerly Human Society and Culture; ANTH-UA 1) Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3) Language, Culture, and Society (formerly Anthropology of Language; ANTH-UA 17; offered only in the spring semester) The remaining elective courses for the major (five courses/20 points) may be selected from any subfield of anthropology. Students must take at least five courses from the Department of Anthropology at New York University in order to receive a major in anthropology from NYU, and a grade of C or better is required in every course to be counted toward the major. Students are not required to focus on any one of the subfields of anthropology represented in the department, but rather are free to choose elective courses that accommodate their interests as narrowly or broadly as they see fit, in consultation with the DUS. Internships approved by the DUS are encour - aged, but internship credits may not be applied toward the major. Independent study courses, conducted under the supervision of a departmental faculty member, are also encouraged and can be applied toward the major, up to a limit of 8 credits. Majors should consult regularly with the DUS in order to take full advantage of the seminars and research opportunities open to them. Joint Majors with Classical Civilization and Linguistics In collaboration with the Department of Classics and the Department of Linguistics, the Department of Anthropology also offers two joint majors. Joint majors consist of 20 points (five 4-point courses) in anthropology and another 20 points in the joint department. Joint majors should consult regularly with the DUS in anthropology and the DUS in the joint department in order to take full advantage of the seminars and research opportunities open to them. Joint major with the Department of Classics: The joint major in anthropology and classical civilization emphasizes the importance of anthropological approaches to understanding the social orders and institutions of the classical world. One anthropology course, Culture, Power, Society Anthropology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 48 (ANTH-UA 1), is required, along with four other anthropology electives chosen in consultation with the DUS of each department. Twenty points are required in classics. See classics section in this Bulletin for additional information. All courses must be completed with a C or better. Joint major with the Department of Linguistics: The joint major in anthropology and linguistics emphasizes the complementary nature of anthropological and sociolinguistic approaches to language. Students are required to take five 4-point courses (20 points) each from the Department of Anthropology and the Department of Linguistics, and a grade of at least C is required in every course to be counted toward the joint major. Required courses in anthropology are Culture, Power, Society (ANTH-UA 1); Language, Culture, and Society (ANTH-UA 17); Language, Power, and Identity (ANTH-UA 16); and two other cultural or linguistic anthropology courses approved by the Department of Anthropology's DUS. Required courses in linguistics are Language (LING-UA 1), Language and Society (LING-UA 15), and at least two of the following: Bilingualism (LING-UA 18); Sex, Gender, and Language (LING-UA American Vernacular English: Language and Culture (LING-UA 23); Language and Liberation at Home in the Caribbean and Abroad (LING-UA 26); and Language in Latin America (LING-UA 30). The fifth course in linguistics may be an additional course from the above list or another course that the department offers, chosen in consultation with the DUS in the Department of Linguistics. See linguistics section in this Bulletin for additional information. Joint anthropology-linguistics majors should also consult with Professor Bambi Schieffelin in the Department of Anthropology and the DUS in the Department of Linguistics for aid in developing their program of study. Combined Major in Global Public Health and Anthropology The College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Department of Anthropology offer students the opportunity to pursue a major that combines anthropology and global public health. Students pursuing this combined program will complete core and elective courses in both areas. The major provides interdisciplinary training that embraces the natural convergence of society, culture, and health, and draws on the Department of Anthropology's strength in bridging the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities. The joint major in global public health and anthropology prepares students to analyze various cultural traditions through the lens of health; to examine complex relationships within economic, political, cultural, physical, and biological environments; and to apply anthropological approaches to public health problems. The joint major is designed to prepare students for multidisciplinary careers in a variety of settings and/ or for advanced academic training in public health, anthropology, or other related fields. Students in this combined major must talk to the DUS or departmental liaison with GPH in the Department of Anthropology to work out a course plan. The following are the fifteen courses (60 points) required for the major: Global public health requirements (seven courses/28 points): Health and Society in a Global Context (UGPH-GU 10) Biostatistics (UGPH-GU 20). This satisfies the College Core Curriculum requirement in Quantitative Reasoning. Epidemiology (UGPH-GU 30) Health Policy in a Global World (UGPH-GU 40) Environmental Health in a Global World (UGPH-GU 50) GPH Internship (UGPH-GU 60) Anthropology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 49 One semester of advanced foreign language (above intermediate II level). Students who present AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of at least one course above intermediate two have satisfied the requirement. Students who take an NYU language placement exam and demonstrate proficiency equivalent to completion of at least one course above the intermediate two level (i.e., they at least place into the second course above interme - diate two) have also met this requirement. One semester of study away Anthropology core courses (three courses/12 points): Culture, Power, Society (ANTH-UA 1) Medical Anthropology (ANTH-UA 35) Global Biocultures (ANTH-UA 36) Anthropology elective courses (three courses/12 points), chosen from: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) Language, Power and Identity (ANTH-UA 16) Conversations in Everyday Life (ANTH-UA 32) Human Variation (ANTH-UA 51) Evolutionary Medicine (ANTH-UA 55) Emerging Diseases (ANTH-UA 80) Anthropology of Gender and Sexuality (ANTH-UA 112) Disability Worlds (ANTH-UA 113) Race, Difference, and Social Inequality (ANTH-UA 323) Introduction to Forensic Anthropology (ANTH-UA 326) Human Rights and Culture (ANTH-UA 331) The Social Life of Food: Producing, Selling, Cooking, Sharing, Eating (ANTH-UA 410) Major electives (two courses/8 points): Two additional electives must be completed in the GPH program or anthropology, by advisement. For descriptions of GPH (UGPH-GU) courses, and for all policies applying to the major (including those for transfer students), please see the global public health section of this Bulletin. Minor in Anthropology The minor in anthropology consists of 16 points (any four 4-point courses) in the department. The \"principles\" courses Culture, Power, Society (ANTH-UA 1), Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2), Archaeology: Early Societies and Cultures (ANTH-UA 3), and Language, Culture, and Society (ANTH-UA 17) are recommended as overviews of the discipline. Minors consult with the DUS to design a program that best accommodates their interests. A grade of C or better is required in every course to be counted toward the minor. Students must take at least two courses from the Department of Anthropology at New York University in order to receive a minor in anthropology from NYU. Internship credits cannot be counted toward the minor, but independent study credits (no more than 4) are acceptable. Honors Program A degree in anthropology is awarded with honors to selected anthropology majors who apply for admission to the program through the DUS during their junior year. Honors program candidates are expected to meet all the requirements for the program and to maintain an overall grade point average of 3.65 and an average of 3.65 in the major. Candidates for the honors program must Anthropology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 50 complete a total of ten 4-point courses (40 points) in anthropology, including the two-semester research/thesis writing sequence, Honors Research I (ANTH-UA 950) and Honors Research II (ANTH-UA 951) taken in the senior year, plus at least one graduate course, typically taken in the junior or senior year. All of these courses count toward the major. In the spring semester of the junior year, students will secure a faculty supervisor for their honors thesis. (In January of the senior year, the student will choose a second faculty reader in consulta - tion with the thesis supervisor). In the fall semester of the senior year, all thesis writers from across departmental subdisciplines enroll in Honors Research I (ANTH-UA 950), a 2-point seminar course in which research methods are taught and individualized to fit each student's topic\u2014e.g., assembling a bibliography; constructing hypotheses; using secondary, primary, and occasionally original sources to generate data; and analyzing data. In the spring semester, all thesis writers enroll in Honors Research II (ANTH-UA 951), a 2-point seminar course in which students share their developing theses with the group. Student should also enroll in a 2-point independent study with their thesis adviser. Honors candidates are strongly encouraged to formally present posters/ papers at the Dean's Undergraduate Research Conference and within the department. Feedback will be offered at different stages by both faculty and student peers in the seminar. In both semes - ters, it is the responsibility of the thesis writer to consult with his or her departmental faculty mentor who is supervising the honors project and who will serve as the primary thesis reader. Independent Study Students must obtain permission from the director of undergraduate studies to register for the independent study courses ANTH-UA 997 or 998 (2 or 4 points per term; 6 or 8 points may be appropriate in exceptional cases). Independent study is an opportunity for students to work closely with a faculty adviser on a project related to their area of study. Students must choose a member of the faculty in their area of study with whom they have taken at least one anthropology course. After securing approval from a faculty member in writing, the student should see the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) in order to register for an independent study course. It is imperative that students meet on a regular basis with their faculty adviser throughout the semester in which they are doing the independent study. Upon completion of the independent study, the faculty adviser must present written proof that the student has completed all course work for the study to the DUS, along with the student's final grade. Independent study units can be applied toward the major and minor in anthropology and can fulfill one of the student's elective requirements, provided that the student earns a grade of at least C. A maximum of 8 units of independent study can be applied to the 36 units required for the major in Anthropology, and a maximum of 4 units of independent study can be applied to the 16 units required for the minor. Internships Only anthropology majors who have the permission of the director of undergraduate studies may register for the internship courses ANTH-UA 980 or 981 (2 or 4 points per term). Internship credits cannot be applied toward the major. Internships are opportunities for students to gain practical work experience relevant to anthropology and are sponsored by selected institutions, agencies, and research laboratories. Internships are negotiated between the student, the internship sponsor, and a faculty member in anthropology who will supervise the internship. The expected time commitment for internships is 8 hours per week for 4 credits. On the internship form, which is available in the department office, the student will describe the Anthropology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 51 intended internship, indicating how it is relevant to his/her academic training in anthropology. The statement should also include an outline of the professional and educational duties and responsibilities of the student intern. The student, the department faculty, and the internship site sponsor will each sign the form, which the student will return to the department.

Prehistoric Hunters and Gatherers ANTH-UA 210 Pargeter. 4 points. Few of the essentialist qualities assigned to this mode of subsistence hold up to serious cross-cultural analysis: hunt - er-gatherer subsistence is not inherently linked to egalitarianism, generalized reciprocity, or settlement mobility. Moreover, hunter-gatherer populations once believed to be deeply rooted in evolutionary time are now understood as historical consequences of global - ization and colonial expansion. We examine variability in hunter-gatherer subsistence, mobility, social organiza - tion, belief systems, landscape use, and material culture, and ask to what extent studies from across the spectrum of hunter-gatherer behaviors can help us understand and explore human evolu - tion.

Anthropology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF Art History Chair of the Department Associate Professor Geronimus Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Martinas.nyu.edu/arthistory Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 303 New York, NY 10003-6688 212-998-8180Director of Urban Design and Architecture Studies Program Clinical Professor Broderick Art History / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 61 OVERVIEWOnce described by New York Times art critic John Russell as the best undergraduate department of art history in the country, the art history program at NYU was established to provide a rigorous and wide-ranging education in the many facets of the history and theory of art, a mission that its faculty continues to enthusiastically embrace. Students become familiar with global art from antiquity to the present. The department offers courses in ancient, medieval, Renaissance, baroque, modern, contemporary, East Asian, South Asian, Islamic, Latin American, African, Oceanic, Pre- Columbian, and Native American art, treating not only painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography but also graphic media, manuscript illumination, the decorative arts, and aspects of urban design. The department is one of the few undergraduate programs in the country with extensive offerings in conservation and museology. A myriad of museums, galleries, and local architectural sites make New York City the ideal place in which to study the visual arts on site and in the flesh. Beyond New York, art history courses are offered at NYU's study away sites, such as Berlin, Buenos Aires, Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, and Prague. The department offers majors and minors in art history and in urban design and architecture studies. Since an education in the history of art can be enhanced by a firsthand understanding of its making, our majors are encouraged to minor in studio art through the Steinhardt School. The department publishes its own student journal ( Ink & Image ), and has an honors program which culminates in the writing and oral defense of a senior honors thesis. Art history graduates have proven exceptionally successful in securing positions in museums, commercial galleries, auction houses, and nonprofit organizations. Those who go on to undertake graduate study typically pursue careers as curators, conservators, and academic art historians at the university and college level. Students majoring in urban design and architecture are well prepared for graduate study in architecture, urban planning, and historic preservation. n Professors Emeriti Hyman, Landau, Walton Helen Gould Sheppard Professor Emerita of the History of Art SandlerHelen Gould Sheppard Professor of the History of Art Sullivan William R.

One 4-point advanced course in ancient or medieval art chosen from the following: ARTH-UA 101-105, ARTH-UA One 4-point advanced course in Renaissance or baroque art chosen from the following: ARTH-UA 301-309, and ARTH-UA 350 One 4-point advanced course in modern art chosen from the following: At least one 4-point course in non-Western art 560, and ARTH-UA 570 One Advanced Seminar (ARTH-UA 800) to be taken during the junior or senior year. Students must have completed four art history courses before enrolling in an advanced seminar. Two ARTH-UA electives chosen from any courses other than those listed under the \"survey requirement\" above, or any approved course offered in another department or at an NYU study away site. Any course in the urban design and architecture studies program may be counted as an elective for the art history major. Other proposed substitutions must be discussed with and approved by the director of undergraduate studies prior to election of the course in question. Major in Classics and Art History For details of this interdepartmental major, refer to the description under the Department of Classics in this Bulletin. With prior departmental approval, students can count two courses from any single NYU study away site toward this major and may count a total of three courses from more than one site. Art History / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 63 Major in Urban Design and Architecture Studies This major requires nine 4-point courses (36 points). Students work with the program director to achieve career-oriented goals within the major. Course work must include the following: Survey requirement (two courses/8 points). Students take both: History of Architecture from Antiquity to the Present (ARTH-UA 601) Shaping the Urban Environment (ARTH-UA 661) A combination of core courses and cross-referenced courses, chosen from the following: ARTH-UA 104, ARTH-UA ARTH-UA one seminar chosen from ARTH-UA 670-679, ARTH-UA 681 Minor in Art History Four 4-point ARTH-UA courses (16 points) that do not overlap in content. At least one must focus on non-western art, or on a field other than modern or contemporary. Minor in Urban Design and Architecture Studies Any four 4-point courses (16 points) from URDS offerings that do not overlap in content. Granting of Credit for Departmental Majors and Minors A score of 5 on the Advanced Placement Art History examination, or a score of A on the Advanced Level History of Art examination, exempts students from History of Western Art I and II (ARTH-UA 1 and 2) and counts as one course toward the major (i.e., the major can be completed with eight courses). These credits cannot count toward the minor. Lower scores on AP and A Levels do not count toward the major or minor. Credit toward the art history and urban design major or minor is granted only for courses completed with a grade of C or higher. Courses graded Pass/Fail do not count. Students cannot receive credit for both History of Western Art I (ARTH-UA 1) and Ancient Art (ARTH-UA 3) or Medieval Art (ARTH-UA 4); or for both History of Western Art II (ARTH-UA 2) and Renaissance and Baroque Art (ARTH-UA 5) or Modern Art (ARTH-UA 6), as their contents overlap. Art history courses taken in the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development may not be double-counted for credit toward an art history minor. However, for Steinhardt students taking a minor in art history, the two-semester Steinhardt survey Art and Contemporary Culture is the prerequisite for advanced Renaissance, baroque, and modern courses. Art and Contemporary Culture II may only serve as the prerequisite for advanced modern courses. Courses in the College Core Curriculum Students majoring or minoring in art history or urban design and architecture studies are exempt from the College Core Curriculum's Expressive Culture requirement. Students who wish to have a Core Expressive Culture course (CORE-UA 720, CORE-UA 721, or CORE-UA 722) count for credit toward either major must secure the permission of the director of undergraduate studies for art history or the director of the urban design and architecture studies program. Art History / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 64 Graduation with Departmental Honors Students may graduate with departmental honors in art history or in urban design and architecture studies by successfully researching and writing a senior thesis. This represents the culmination of the work for the major and provides excellent preparation for graduate school. To be eligible for the honors program, students must have a GPA of 3.65 or higher at the conclusion of the junior year, both overall and in art history or in urban design and architecture studies. A student wishing to write an honors thesis must apply for admission to the program via the department's NYU Classes site in early March of the junior year. For a complete description of all the honors thesis requirements, please visit our departmental NYU Classes site for honors- track students. Work toward the senior thesis consists of two 4-point honors courses (ARTH-UA 801 and ARTH-UA 804) focusing on research methods and writing, accompanied by regular meetings with the supervising professor. The completed thesis, at least 30 to 40 pages in length, is read by a committee of three faculty members, including the supervising professor. The committee meets with the student for a thesis defense at the end of the academic year. Satisfactory completion of the thesis, in the committee's judgment, earns an honors degree. These two honors courses may replace the two electives required for the major. Internship Policy Under exceptional circumstances, the Department of Art History awards academic credit (2 points) for an internship accompanied by an independent study. Students must find a professor willing to supervise this study. Course work may include a written diary recording the student's work experience and will include a term paper relevant to the internship, to be approved by the supervising professor. The independent study must also be approved by the director of undergraduate studies.

Art History / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22MAJOR/MINOR IN Asian/Pacific/American Studies Director of Asian/Pacific/American Studies Associate Professor Parikh as.nyu.edu/apa 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor New York, NY 10003-7112 212-992-9650 Asian/Pacific/American Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 77 OVERVIEWThe program in Asian/Pacific/American studies, housed in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), offers a rigorous and broad education in the history and contemporary experiences of Asian peoples\u2014whether from East Asia, South Asia, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, or from diasporic communities across the world\u2014in the present-day Americas. Students gain an understanding of Asian American culture in relation to such topics as law, art, health, urban politics, community studies, (popular) culture, language, and art. The program collaborates closely with the A/P/A Institute to bring important artists, scholars, performers, and activists to campus where they engage in close dialogue with undergraduates, faculty, and the broader New York community. Its stellar teaching staff, many of whom also have prominent careers as curators, activists, and artists, offers a diverse range of courses from the politics of beauty to secret histories of New York. n PROGRAM Major The Asian/Pacific/American studies major requires nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better. Two introductory courses\u2014may be taken in either order: Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101) Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures (CORE-UA 539; offered every fall) Six elective courses: Six designated Asian/Pacific/American studies electives, of which four must be taught by SCA faculty. SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program (SCA-UA 42) is no longer required but is highly recommended and can count as an elective; one A/P/A language course can count as an elective if taught by SCA faculty. One research course: Advanced Research Minor Five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better are required for the minor in Asian/Pacific/American studies. Students must take Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/ American Cultures (CORE-UA 539; offered every fall). They also take four designated Asian/Pacific/ American studies electives, of which two must be taught by SCA faculty. One A/P/A language course can count as an elective if taught by SCA faculty. Language and Linguistic Competency The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within and across different social groups. Studying the modern incarnation of these languages reveals the cross-cultural forces that have shaped them. We speak what we are and have been. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in Cantonese, Filipino, and/or any language spoken in the Asia or Pacific regions by any of the following means: taking language courses offered in A/P/A studies; taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying these languages beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. Policy on Double Counting of Courses Majors may share (double count) two courses with a second major, with permission from the other department/program. Minors may share (double count) one course with a major or a second minor, with permission from the other department/program.

The Department of Biology is home to world-class laboratories with faculty dedicated to pushing the frontiers of knowledge and educating the next generation of scientists and biomedical professionals. Research and teaching span the range of modern biology, from microbes to multicellular animals and plants, and from molecular and cellular processes to genetics, development, behavior, and evolution. The department is committed to providing an education that is rigorous, exciting, and inclusive. Students are exposed to modern concepts and state-of-the-art methods throughout their studies, from introductory courses to upper-level electives that explore major fields of biology in depth. Education extends beyond the classroom as well. Students are encouraged to participate in laboratory research in the department and at other New York institutions. Students also may study away while advancing in the major, an opportunity for global engagement that science majors elsewhere typically do not have. The biology majors and minors provide outstanding preparation for careers in research, academia, medicine, dentistry, and related fields. Graduates of the department have a remarkable record of success in acceptance into professional schools and in establishing notable careers in the biomed - ical sciences. n Professor Emeritus Borowsky Provost, NYU Abu Dhabi; Professor of Biology Piano Silver Professor; Professor of Biology; Director, NYU Center for Developmental Genetics Desplan Silver Professors; Professors of Biology Carlton, PuruggananProfessor of Biology; Director, NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology Bonneau Carroll and Milton Petrie Professor Sanjana, Kirov, Schneider-PaolantonioClinical Assistant Akum, Galifianakis, Osmundson, Parker Distinguished Professor in Residence DeSalle Global Distinguished Professor Rajewsky Affiliated Faculty Center for Neural Science Aoki, Carter, Klann, Reyes, Sanes, ShapleyFACULTY 83 Department of Physics BrujicDepartment of Teaching and Learning (Steinhardt) KirchAmerican Museum of Natural History DeSalleMax Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine Rajewsky PROGRAM Major in Biology (Bachelor of Arts): General Information Three options are available to students pursuing a major in biology. The standard biology track gives majors a broad background, with the laboratory, quantitative, and reasoning skills needed for today's biology. The ecology track also provides students with a broad background in modern biology, but with a focus on ecological concepts, approaches, and analytical methods. It is primarily intended for students planning to pursue graduate study in ecology or a related field. Finally, the global public health/science major with a concentration in biology provides students with strong foundations in biological science and global public health, with a focus on one of three emphasis areas: genetics and genomics, infectious diseases, or environmental health. Each biology major is assigned a faculty adviser from the department and meets with that professor to select courses in the context of the student's academic and career goals. Faculty advisers also guide students in pursuing opportunities for curricular enhancement, such as research experiences and study away. To permit the maximal choice of appropriate upper-level courses, we strongly recommend that students take Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12), General Chemistry I and II and Laboratories (CHEM-UA 125, 126), and calculus in the first year. Detailed additional information on course planning is available through the department web site and should be discussed with the faculty adviser. Programs of majors must be approved each term by a department adviser. All courses counted toward the major must be completed with a grade of C or better. Standard Biology Track The standard track of the biology major requires 16 courses (70 points), as follows. Biology core courses (four courses/16 points): Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12) NOTE: Biology majors are not required to register for the 1-credit Principles of Biology Lab (BIOL-UA 123). It is intended for prehealth students not majoring in biology. Molecular and Cell Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 21, 22) NOTE: Students may also register for the optional 1-credit Molecular and Cell Biology Lab (BIOL-UA 223) concurrently with MCB I (BIOL-UA 21). Five upper-level biology courses (five courses/20 points): Biology majors must complete five additional 4-point upper-level biology courses. In consultation with their adviser or with the director of undergraduate studies, students select at least one course from each of the following three skill categories, plus two additional electives: 1. Laboratory skill courses: \"At the Bench\" or research courses 2. Quantitative skill courses: math, computational, and modeling courses 3.

Biology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22MINOR IN Business Studies cas.nyu.edu/business Silver Center100 Washington Square East, Room 901 New York, NY 10003 212-998-8160 Business Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 98 OVERVIEWA broad liberal arts education, which includes a general education component (the College Core Curriculum) and a major in a liberal arts discipline or interdisciplinary field, provides a solid foundation for many careers in business. The skills and perspectives of the liberal arts are practical as well as personally enriching. Liberal arts students can enhance their preparedness for business by also completing a small number of relevant courses. In consultation with the Undergraduate College of the Leonard N. Stern School of Business, the College of Arts and Science has identified a set of such courses, some offered by CAS and some offered by Stern. By completing the business studies minor, students acquire the core knowledge and quantitative skills that are invaluable assets for success in the business professions. The minor in business studies is administered by the College of Arts and Science and is available to all students in the University. Students considering the minor should consult with the business studies adviser in the College Preprofessional Advising Office at Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160; cas.business@nyu.edu . n Two Tracks of the Business Studies Minor Students must choose one of two tracks in this minor: Track A is for students in any division of NYU who are not pursuing or planning any major or minor in the CAS Department of Economics. Track B is for students in any division of NYU who are pursuing or planning any economics major or minor in CAS. At present, students in the Schack Institute of Real Estate in the School of Professional Studies may be allowed to follow this track, as their major has a substantial overlap of courses with the CAS major and minor in economics. Students cannot choose freely between the two tracks; they must select their track in the minor based on whether or not they are pursuing or intending to pursue any major or minor in the CAS Department of Economics. Track A: For Students Not Majoring or Minoring in the CAS Department of Economics Track A of the business studies minor consists of six to seven courses (four to five courses in economics and mathematics in CAS, plus two in business through Stern). Students may use AP or equivalent international credit to satisfy two out of these three requirements: macroeconomics, PROGRAM 99 microeconomics, and calculus. When students have advanced standing credit in all three areas, they must register for one of these three subjects at NYU (ECON-UA 1 or 2, with loss of the equiv - alent advanced standing credit; or one of the math courses listed below, with loss of equivalent advanced standing credit if MATH-UA 121 is taken). AP or other credit can never be used for statistics, regression and forecasting, or any Stern courses. Courses are 4 points unless noted otherwise. (Please consult departmental websites and sections in this Bulletin for course prerequisites, which are enforced). At least four 4-point courses must be unique to this minor and not overlap with any other major or minor; therefore, no more than two of the required 4-point courses for the business studies minor can also be used to satisfy requirements for a major or another minor. Students who go over this two-course overlap must take one or more additional 4-point courses in Stern. Track A students may choose to take three or four Stern courses in total (beyond the minimum minor requirement of two Stern courses), but CAS students must ensure they can accommodate the extra Stern courses within the College's 16-point limit on non-CAS courses. Otherwise, they must consult the CAS Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130) to request raising the limit. Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1), or AP/equivalent international advanced standing Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), or AP/equivalent international advanced standing One course in calculus chosen from: Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) AP (or equivalent international advanced standing) credit in calculus Calculus II (NYU Tandon School of Engineering, MA 1124) One course in statistics chosen from (AP or equivalent international credit is not accepted): Statistics (ECON-UA 18; prerequisite: MATH-UA 122 or MATH-UA 212) Mathematical Statistics (MATH-UA 234). Only for students majoring in mathematics. Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10). Only for students majoring in psychology. Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800). Statistics for Social Research (SOC-UA 302). Only for students majoring in sociology. Statistics for Business Control (STAT-UB 1). Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103; 6 points). Regression and forecasting requirement: Students who take Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103; prerequisite: MATH-UA 121 or 211; 6 points) satisfy both the statistics and the regression requirement with this one course. All other students must take Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 3; prerequisite: ECON-UA 18 or 20 or MATH-UA 234, PSYCH-UA 10, or SOC-UA 302; 2 points) Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1) is required of all minors. One of the following Stern core courses: Management and Organizations (MGMT-UB 1) or Introduction to Marketing (MKTG-UB 1) or Information Technology in Business and Society (INFO-UB 1) or Operations Management (OPMG-UB 1). Prerequisites: (1) completion of the statistics require - ment, chosen only from Statistics (ECON-UA 18) or Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) or Statistics for Business Control (STAT-UB 1) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression Business Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 100 and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103), and (2) completion of the regression and forecasting requirement, chosen only from Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) or Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 3) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103). Notes on Track A (Non-Economics Track) Notes on the economics requirement: Students on Track A are advised not to use AP or other advanced standing credit in macroeconomics and/or microeconomics as prerequisites for the second-year economics major courses Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) and Interme - diate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). These courses are calculus-based and strictly sequential, and carry firm prerequisites of Mathematics for Economics I, II (MATH-UA 211, 212; AP or other advanced standing credit in calculus is not acceptable). Only students who transition from Liberal Studies may satisfy the macroeconomics and micro - economics requirement of the minor with Economics I (ECI-UF 1001, 4 points) and Economics II (ECI-UF 1002, 4 points). Notes on the statistics requirement: The substitute courses MATH-UA 234, PSYCH-UA 10, and SOC-UA 302 are acceptable prerequisites for Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 3; 2 points), but are not acceptable prerequisites for the optional minor courses Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2) and Operations Management (OPMG-UB 1). Note on overlap courses: If more than two of the required 4-point courses (or advanced standing credit substitutions) for Track A of the business studies minor are also used to satisfy requirements for a major or another minor, then students must take one or more additional courses in Stern, over and above the minimum requirement of two courses in Stern (this minor must always consist of at least four unique, non-overlapping, 4-point courses). See section \"Stern courses,\" below. Track B: For Students Majoring or Minoring in the CAS Department of Economics Track B of the business studies minor always consists of four 4-point business courses (16 points) in Stern. For students who matriculate in CAS in and after fall 2018, it also includes a regression requirement (usually 2 points). No CAS courses can count toward this track of the minor. No more than two of the required courses for the business studies minor can also be used to satisfy requirements for a major or another minor. Students who go over this two-course overlap must take one or more additional 4-point courses in Stern. As this will put CAS students over the College's 16-point limit on non-CAS courses, they must consult the CAS Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130) to request raising the limit. Track B of the business studies minor requires the following four 4-point Stern courses: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1) is required of all minors. One of the following Stern core courses: Management and Organizations (MGMT-UB 1) or Introduction to Marketing (MKTG-UB 1) or Information Technology in Business and Society (INFO-UB 1) or Operations Management (OPMG-UB 1). Prerequisites: (1) a course in statistics, chosen only from Statistics (ECON-UA 18) or Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) or Statistics for Business Control (STAT-UB 1) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103); and (2) a course in regression and forecasting, chosen only from Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) or Regression and Forecasting Models Business Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 101 (STAT-UB 3) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT- UB 103). Two more 4-point courses in Stern, to be chosen from the core courses above and/or from: Managerial Accounting (ACCT-UB 4). Prerequisite: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1). Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2). Prerequisites: (1) Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2); (2) a course in statistics, chosen only from Statistics (ECON-UA 18) or Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) or Statistics for Business Control (STAT-UB 1) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103); and (3) completion of a course in regression and forecasting, chosen only from Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) or Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 3) or Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103). Corequisite: Principles of Financial Accounting (ACCT-UB 1). Note that students matriculating in CAS in or after fall 2018 must also meet a regression require - ment. The recommended course is Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 3), prerequisite: Statistics (ECON-UA 18), Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), or an equivalent statistics course; 2 points. Students may instead choose to take Statistics for Business Control and Regression and Forecasting Models (STAT-UB 103; 6 points) or Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266; 4 points); prerequisites for all of these courses are strictly enforced. Note on Track B (Economics Track) Note on regression and forecasting: Economics majors who wish to take Foundations of Finance (FINC-UB 2) and/or Operations Management (OPMG-UB 1) for their track of the business studies minor should note that these two courses have as their prerequisite a course in regression and forecasting. Therefore, they may only be taken after Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266). Economics majors may, if they wish, take the 2-point regression course STAT-UB 3. This course is not required for the economics major, but it allows economics students to take FINC-UB 2 and/or OPMG-UB 1 earlier in their undergraduate careers. Note on Schack Institute of Real Estate students: At present, students in the Schack Institute of Real Estate in the School of Professional Studies may be allowed to follow this track, as their major has substantial overlap of courses with the CAS major and minor in economics. Grading and Credit Policies Applying to Both Tracks of the Minor A minimum grade of C is required for all courses intended to count toward the minor, and the minimum overall GPA required in the minor is 2.0. No credit toward the minor can be granted for internships. No Stern courses can count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students to CAS are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. Courses from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering are not acceptable, except for Calculus II (MA 1124, 4 points). Transfer Student Policies Applying to Both Tracks of the Minor All transfer credit must be evaluated by the Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 901; 212-998-8160) in order to determine its applicability toward the minor; submit course syllabi to cas.business@nyu.edu . Business Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 102 Transfer students on Track A cannot transfer in more than half of the required courses in economics and mathematics (i.e., two) and half of the Stern courses in business (i.e., one) to count toward the minor; for transfer students, AP and other advanced standing credit is treated as transfer credit. Transfer students on Track B cannot transfer in more than half of the Stern courses in business (i.e., two) to count toward the minor; AP and other advanced standing credit is not acceptable for Stern requirements.

Business Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF Chemistry Chair of the Department Professor Canary Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Jerschowas.nyu.edu/chemistry Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 1001 New York, NY 10003-6688 212-998-8400 Chemistry / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 103 OVERVIEWThe Department of Chemistry has a long tradition in the College of Arts and Science, dating back well before the founding of the American Chemical Society at New York University in 1876. Professor John W. Draper, the first president of the society and chair of the department, was a remarkable polymath: chemist, physician, philosopher, historian, and pioneering photographer. The department has undertaken a major development plan, strengthening its faculty, instructional laboratories, course offerings, and research facilities in the areas of physical, biophysical, bioorganic, and biomedical chemistry, as well as in chemical biology, nanoscience, and materials sciences. Qualified undergraduates are strongly encouraged to participate in research as early as their sophomore year of study. The department houses state-of-the-art laboratory facilities for its undergraduate chemistry courses. Majoring in chemistry at NYU provides strong preparation for graduate study in chemistry and biochemistry; professional education in medicine, dentistry, or patent law; and careers in industrial or pharmaceutical chemistry and biotechnology. n Professors Emeriti Gans, Kallenbach, Moskowitz, Pope, Schuster Janice Cutler Professor of Chemistry Trauner Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor of Chemistry Seeman Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor of Medicinal Chemistry WoerpelSilver Professor and Professor of Chemistry Ward Professors Arora, Bai, Canary, Geacintov, Hamilton, Associate Scholars Hu, Shafirovich, Shtukenberg Clinical Professors Orr, Qamra, Zhao FACULTYDepartmental Objectives Chemistry, known as the central natural science, bridges physics and biology. The atomic and molecular structure and properties of matter are fundamental to the investigation of the physical world and to the understanding of living systems. Modern chemistry spans chemical physics, materials science, and molecular biology, merging the traditional divisions of analytical, organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry. Recently, the department has focused its growth on physical, biophysical, and bioorganic chemistry, exploiting interdisciplinary areas of theory, nanoscience and materials, and biological and biomedical chemistry. The department has a large and active theoretical group in the areas of chemical physics and biomolecular modeling. Graduates of the department find rewarding careers and achieve distinction in all phases of scientific life, from basic research to commercial product development. The late Gertrude Elion, a 1941 M.S. in Chemistry from New York University, shared the 1988 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for her research in pharmaceutical chemistry. Phil Baran (B.S. 1997), a professor at the Scripps Research Institute, was named a MacArthur Fellow for 2013. The department offers majors in chemistry, biochemistry, and global public health/science with a concentration in chemistry. Students have the opportunity to earn either a B.A. or B.S. in the chemistry major. A selection of elective advanced courses, undergraduate and graduate, can be combined (in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies) to provide a broad, varied program of study in chemistry or an undergraduate specialization in organic, biochemical, physical, or theoretical chemistry. The programs of study in chemistry and biochemistry prepare students for graduate study leading to careers in research, development, and teaching and/or for further study in areas such as medicine, dentistry, basic medical sciences, and allied health fields (including forensic science). In addition, the chemistry and biochemistry majors both prepare students for alternative careers, especially when paired with a minor in economics or business studies: for example, patent law, technology investment, or management in the chemical industry. The department offers advanced versions of the general and organic chemistry courses that are required for several science majors and for the pre-health curriculum (leading to professional and graduate study in medicine, dentistry, and basic medical sciences). Students need permission from the department to register for these advanced courses. Majors in Chemistry and Biochemistry: General Information Students considering a major in chemistry or biochemistry are strongly urged to seek course advisement from the director of undergraduate studies as early in their academic careers as possible. Chemistry is a sequential subject with courses building on earlier courses. Delay in taking certain key prerequisite courses can make it impossible to complete a major in four years without summer attendance. A grade of C or better in chemistry and the other required courses is required for the fulfillment of the chemistry or biochemistry major in the department. Students who do not have an average of 2.0 in departmentally required courses by the time they have completed 64 points in all courses will be asked to change their major. The Department of Chemistry strictly enforces all prerequisites and de-enrolls students from courses for which they do meet the prerequisites. Prerequisite courses must be completed with a grade of C (not C minus) or better. AP, IB, and A Level credit by examination in chemistry is not accepted toward any departmental majors or minors. 104 PROGRAM Chemistry / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 105 Core Courses for the Majors in Chemistry and Biochemistry The majors in chemistry and biochemistry build on a core of required courses in chemistry, physics, and mathematics. (Note that biology is not required for any major or minor offered by the Department of Chemistry, only by the prehealth program.) The six required core courses (28 points) in this department are: General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125) General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126) Organic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225) Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226) Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652) The majors version of the organic chemistry sequences\u2014CHEM-UA 227 and CHEM-UA 228 (see course descriptions)\u2014substitute for CHEM-UA 225 and CHEM-UA 226, respectively. In addition, the one-semester Accelerated General Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 129; 6 points) may substitute for the CHEM-UA 125, 126 sequence. In addition to these chemistry courses, the chemistry and biochemistry majors require four courses (18 points) in mathematics and physics: Calculus I (MATH-UA 121), or Advanced Placement (or equivalent international exam) credit. Calculus II (MATH-UA 122). Advanced Placement credit for MATH-UA 122 (a score of 5 on BC Calculus) is not accepted for this major requirement. Students with this AP credit must either (1) take Calculus II at NYU and forfeit 4 of the 8 AP credits, or (2) register for one of the following: Mathematics of Chemistry (CHEM-UA 140), Calculus III (MATH-UA 123), or Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140), using the BC credits as a prerequisite. General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11). Credit for AP Physics C: Mechanics with a score of 4 or 5 is accepted, but only for students who are not prehealth. No other AP or equivalent international credit is accepted.** General Physics II (PHYS-UA 12). Credit for AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism with a score of 4 or 5 is accepted, but only for students who are not prehealth. No other AP or equivalent international credit is accepted.** **Because of medical, dental, etc. school admissions requirements, students on the pre-health track cannot use AP Physics C credit to place out of either or both semesters of General Physics. Note that Mathematics for Chemistry (CHEM-UA 140) is strongly recommended as preparation for both Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy (CHEM-UA 651) and Physical Chemistry: Thermodynamics and Kinetics (CHEM-UA 652), as well as for students interested in pursuing chemistry on the graduate level or who have an interest in theoretical chemistry. Students may choose instead to take Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) and/or Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140). Freshmen who intend to pursue a major in chemistry or biochemistry and are strong in mathe - matics and the physical sciences are strongly encouraged to take General Physics I and II as their second science sequence (concurrently with general chemistry) in the first year. This allows the physical chemistry courses to be taken as early as sophomore year if the mathematics prereq - uisites are completed, but should be balanced against the desire or need to take biology with chemistry in the freshman year and to defer physics (e.g., for students who are undecided, are considering a major in biology or neural science, and/or are on the pre-health track). The core, described above, provides a basic background in chemistry. Students normally are required to complete the courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, physics, and calculus Chemistry / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 106 prior to entry into CHEM-UA 651, 652 (physical chemistry) in the third year. Alternative programs are also possible. It is strongly advised, however, that an advanced-level chemistry course be taken in the third year of study, allowing at least three more semesters to complete all major requirements. Students interested in careers in medicine, dentistry, or basic medical sciences may wish to consider the major in biochemistry. Coursework in biology is required for such students for admission to schools of the health professions. The appropriate preprofessional adviser should be consulted for details. Major in Chemistry, B.A. The minimum major requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are completion of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661), Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711), and two advanced chemistry elective courses for the B.A. degree. Please note that Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998), Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996), and Mathematics of Chemistry (CHEM-UA 140) do not count as advanced electives for the major. Major in Biochemistry, B.A. The minimum requirements, in addition to the core courses cited above, are Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882), Experimental Biochemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 885), Advanced Biochemistry (CHEM-UA 890), and one advanced chemistry elective. Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998), Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996), and Mathematics of Chemistry (CHEM-UA 140) do not count as advanced electives for the major. Students in this major are reminded that these courses must be taken in the proper order. Careful course planning is required to ensure that this can be done within a normal four-year program. Biochemistry majors are strongly encouraged to take Cellular and Molecular Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 21, 22). This is especially important for those students wishing to enter graduate programs in biochemistry. Major in Chemistry, B.S. Students who complete the required core courses as outlined above, plus the Physical Chemistry Laboratory course (CHEM-UA 661); Inorganic Chemistry (CHEM-UA 711); three advanced electives in chemistry; one course in computer science at or above the level of CSCI-UA 2 (CSCI-UA 101 preferred); and at least two semesters of Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996) will graduate with the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) instead of the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.). Please note that CHEM-UA 997, 998 and CHEM-UA 995, 996 do not count as advanced electives for the major. Students should also note that the B.S. program is more challenging to complete within a normal four-year academic program and that it confers no particular advantage to students in premedical or predental programs. Major in Global Public Health/Science with a Concentration in Chemistry, B.S. Students pursuing this combined program concentrate in chemistry\u2014the central natural science that interfaces physics and mathematics with the life sciences. The major in GPH/science with a concentration in chemistry requires twenty-one courses (90 Chemistry / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 107 points) with a grade of C or better, as follows. Students must plan and schedule carefully for their College Core Curriculum requirements (foreign language, expository writing, and Foundations of Contemporary Culture), and if they are prehealth, they must also take Principles of Biology I, II (BIOL-UA 11, 12) in addition to their Core requirements and the 90 points for the major outlined below. Global public health requirements (six courses/24 points): Health and Society in a Global Context (UGPH-GU 10) Biostatistics (UGPH-GU 20) Epidemiology (UGPH-GU 30) Health Policy in a Global World (UGPH-GU 40) Environmental Health in a Global World (UGPH-GU 50) GPH Internship (UGPH-GU 60) One semester of advanced foreign language (above intermediate II level). Students who present AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of at least one course above intermediate two have satisfied the requirement. Students who take an NYU language placement exam and demonstrate proficiency equivalent to completion of at least one course above the intermediate two level (i.e., they at least place into the second course above interme - diate two) have also met this requirement. One semester of study away Chemistry core courses (eight courses/36 points): General Chemistry and Laboratory I and II (CHEM-UA 125, 126). The one-semester Accelerated General Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 129; 6 points) may be taken by qualified students and substitutes for this sequence. Organic Chemistry and Laboratory I and II (CHEM-UA 225, 226) or Majors Organic Chemistry and Laboratory I and II (CHEM-UA 227, 228). Physical Chemistry: Quantum Mechanics and Spectroscopy and and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882) Additional required courses in science and math (four courses/18 points): Mathematics (two courses/8 points): Calculus I and II (MATH-UA 121,122). Advanced Placement credit for Calculus II (a score of 5 on BC Calculus) is not accepted for this major requirement. Students with this AP credit must either (1) take Calculus II at NYU and forfeit 4 of the 8 AP credits, or (2) register for one of the following: Mathematics of Chemistry (CHEM-UA 140), Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) or Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140), using the BC credits as a prerequisite. Physics (two courses/10 points): General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11, 12). Credit for AP Physics C: Mechanics is accepted for PHYS-UA 11 and credit for AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism is accepted for PHYS-UA 12, but only for students who are not prehealth. No other AP or equivalent international credit is accepted. (Because of medical, dental, etc., school admissions requirements, students on the pre-health track cannot use AP Physics C credit to place out of either or both semesters of General Physics.) Major electives (two courses/8 points): Two additional electives must be completed in GPH and/or in chemistry. Chemistry / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 108 For descriptions of GPH (UGPH-GU) courses and for all policies applying to the major (including those for transfer students), please see the global public health section of this Bulletin. Joint B.S./B.S. Program in Chemistry and Engineering The College of Arts and Science offers a joint B.S/B.S. program with the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. For students interested in chemistry, the program leads to the B.S. degree from CAS and the B.S. degree in chemical and biomolecular engineering from the NYU School of Engineering. Further information is available from the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Policy on School of Engineering courses: No CAS student (whether majoring or minoring in this department or not) is allowed to take Tandon substitute courses for CHEM-UA 125, 126, 127, 128, 129 (general chemistry); 225, 226, 227, 228 (organic chemistry); 651, 652, 661 (physical chemistry); 711 (inorganic chemistry); or 881, 882, 885, 890 (biochemistry). However, students pursuing a major in the Department of Chemistry may seek prior permission of the director of undergraduate studies to take advanced electives in the School of Engineering and apply them to the major. This is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. These courses count against each student's 16-point allowance in the other divisions of NYU and cannot be applied to the 64 point UA residency requirement. Minor in Chemistry Completion of the following four 5-point courses (20 points) constitutes a minor in chemistry: CHEM-UA 125, 126, 225 or 227, and 226 or 228. Only two of the four courses may also be used to satisfy the requirements of another department's major. No grade lower than C will count toward the minor, and an average of 2.0 or better in all chemistry courses is required. Honors Program While the Department of Chemistry has several accelerated courses\u2014for example, Accelerated General Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 129) and Majors Organic Chemistry and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 227 and 228)\u2014these offerings need not be taken to earn a chemistry or biochemistry degree with departmental honors. The main requirement for earning an honors degree is the completion of an honors thesis based upon independent experimental or theoretical research. Students interested in research and an honors degree must enroll in Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995 and 996). Students must first become involved in research, CHEM-UA 997 or 998, for at least one semester or one summer prior to the senior year, as two semesters of research is arguably not enough time to execute a successful research project. Students seeking entry into the honors program must obtain the approval of the director of undergraduate studies prior to the end of their junior year. Candidates for a degree with honors in chemistry must have an overall GPA of 3.65 and a GPA of 3.65 in all required courses for the chemistry or biochemistry major. A senior thesis based on this work must be prepared, approved by the adviser, and presented in a seminar format during the spring term of the senior year. Please contact Carol Hollingsworth, academic program administrator, or Professor Jerschow, director of undergraduate studies, for more detailed information. Research Opportunities The department endeavors to make research opportunities available during the summer and the academic year to well-qualified students at all levels. We strongly urge students who are interested in research to begin as early as freshman year. Depending on the number of credits a Chemistry / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 109 student is registered for, the initial exposure to research may or may not be for credit. Students are encouraged to apply for the FAST and DURF grants awarded by the College. To participate in research in the department, students must both meet the prerequisites and register for the research courses Advanced Independent Study and Research (CHEM-UA 997, 998) or, if eligible, Senior Honors in Chemistry (CHEM-UA 995, 996). In either case, permission of the director of undergraduate studies is required before registering for these courses. Laboratory Policy Due to the potential hazard of any chemical experimentation, safety goggles, laboratory coats, and other protective gear must be worn at all times in the laboratories (but cannot be worn outside the laboratory). Laboratory equipment loaned to students must be replaced if damaged or broken. Students who do not return borrowed laboratory equipment at the end of a course are charged an additional fee, and their grade may be recorded as incomplete and not released until \"checkout\" is completed. COURSES The Department of Chemistry strictly enforces all prerequisites and de-enrolls students from courses for which they do not meet the prerequisites. Prereq - uisite courses must be completed with a grade of C (not C minus) or better. Courses are lectures unless otherwise indicated.

Child and Adolescent Mental Health Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF Cinema Studies Chair of the Department Professor McCarthycinema.tisch.nyu.edu 721 Broadway, 6th Floor New York, NY 10003-6807 212-998-1600Director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Guerrero Cinema Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 123 OVERVIEWThe Department of Cinema Studies at the Tisch School of the Arts holds a preeminent place among cinema studies programs in the world. Its approach to cinema focuses on the processes of understanding film and the moving image in multiple cultural and interdisciplinary contexts. The undergraduate program treats the study of cinema both as an art form and as a form of mass culture. The study of film, as an art, is concerned with the relationships among film style, narrative form, and the material practices that shape the medium. The study of film as mass culture explores how film reflects societal values and processes of social change. The department offers courses in the history, theory, aesthetics, and criticism of film, as well as film genres and techniques. Certain film courses given in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) may also be approved for the major or minor. Most of the Tisch courses include extensive film screenings and are supple - mented by weekly academic departmental events open to all students. Students have access, with permission, to graduate level courses in the department, to Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) courses, and to the Orphans Symposium. Students also have access to extensive film and film-related resources in the department's George Amberg Study Center. The video collection in Bobst Library's Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media provides additional resources. Finally, various New York City institutions make this an extraordinary environment for cinema studies. n Professors Besser, Diawara, Lant, McCarthy, Polan, Stam Associate Harris, Hassapopoulou, Heberer, Lee, LuckettAssociate Arts Professor Suarez Distinguished Teacher Weiss Affiliated Faculty Antonio (Film and Television/ TSOA) Ben-Ghiat (Italian Studies) Canemaker & Television/ TSOA) Ganti (Anthropology) Ginsburg (Anthropology) Iampolski (Comparative Literature and Russian) Mirzoeff (Media, Culture, and Communication/Steinhardt) Murray (Media, Culture, and Communication/Steinhardt) Sandhu (Social and Cultural Analysis) Shohat (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies; Art and Public Policy/TSOA) Sieburth (French and Comparative Literature) Starosielski (Media, Culture, and Communication/Steinhardt) Sturken (Media, Culture, and Communication/Steinhardt) Zito (Religious Studies and Anthropology) FACULTY 124 PROGRAM Major The major in cinema studies consists of ten 4-point courses (40 points), divided into four areas of study: Tier I consists of a core curriculum of five courses taken in sequence. Tier II consists of elective small lecture courses in the areas of film auteurs, genres, historical movements, aesthetics, national cinemas, television studies, and special topics. Tier III consists of large survey courses in American and international cinema (each having a two-semester sequence: fall, origins to 1960; spring, 1960 to present). Tier IV consists of small theory and practice courses (open only to cinema studies majors) in script analysis/writing, film criticism, and forms of filmmaking. Majors are required to complete five courses (20 points) in Tier I. These courses are typically taken in the following order: Expressive Culture: Film (CORE-UA 750) is the preferred gateway course for CAS students. Note: Introduction to Cinema Studies (CINE-UT 10) is only open to officially declared majors/minors. Film History: Silent Cinema (CINE-UT 15) (only offered in the spring) Film Theory (CINE-UT 16) (only offered in the fall) Television: History and Culture (CINE-UT 21) (only offered in the spring) One undergraduate advanced seminar (CINE-UT 7XX) (offered in both the fall and spring) In addition, majors must complete a three-course distribution requirement in film history: one course in U.S. cinema and two courses in non-U.S. cinema. The remaining two courses for the major are chosen from CINE-UT or (with faculty permission) CINE-GT offerings. CINE-UT courses used to satisfy cinema studies major requirements do not count against the limit of 16 points taken outside of the College; in addition, they can be applied toward the 64 credits that internal and external transfer students are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. Advisement In order to declare the cinema studies major and/or be cleared for registration for the forthcom - ing semester, students must schedule an appointment with the departmental CAS liaison during the following periods: fall semester entrance/clearance, March 15 to April 15; spring semester entrance/clearance, October 15 to November 15. If a student does not meet with the department during these periods, he or she will be asked to declare during the next semester. Students must also have one year of residency at CAS prior to declaring the major; incoming freshmen and transfers are not eligible for immediate declaration upon entrance to the University. Minor in Cinema Studies A total of four 4-point courses (16 points) is required for the minor. The first course must be either Expressive Culture: Film (CORE-UA 750), recommended for CAS students, or Introduction to Cinema Studies (CINE-UT 10); the latter is only open to officially declared minors. An additional 12 points must be taken in cinema studies courses (CINE-UT), or in courses from elsewhere in the University that are preapproved by the Department of Cinema Studies. Included in these 12 points must be one course on international cinema and one Tier II cinema studies course. CAS students may declare the minor on Albert. CINE-UT courses used to satisfy cinema studies minor requirements do not count against the limit Cinema Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 125 of 16 points taken outside of the College; in addition, they can be applied toward the 64 credits that internal and external transfer students are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. Minor in Asian Film and Media A total of four 4-point courses (16 points) is required for the minor. The first course must be chosen from Expressive Culture: Film (CORE-UA 750), recommended for CAS students; Introduction to Cinema Studies (CINE-UT 10), open only to declared minors; Language of Film (FMTV-UT 4); Introduction to Media Studies (MCC-UE 1); or Film: History and Form (MCC-UE 1007). Students must also take one Asian film and media core course: either Asian Media and Popular Culture (CINE-UT 112) or Topics in Asian Film History and Historiography (CINE-UT 450). One of these core courses will be offered per year. Students may elect to take both core classes, but it is not required. An additional two courses must be taken from a list of approved electives, which include, for example: Indian Cinemas (CINE-UT 105), Asian-American Cinema (CINE-UT 315), The Martial Arts Film (CINE-UT 324), Cultures and Contexts: South Asia (CORE-UA 503, when the topic is media), East Asian Media and Popular Culture (MCC-UE 1023), and Cinema of the South Asian Diaspora (SCA-UA 313).

We offer many seminar-format courses with intensive faculty interaction and discussion. Our faculty specializations cover European, Anglo-American, African, Slavic, Latin American, Caribbean, Chinese, South Asian, and Middle Eastern literatures. Departmental courses immerse students in ancient, early modern, and modern global literatures, often with an emphasis on Continental philosophy and literary and critical theory more generally. Students are given flexibility in the design of the major (which has two tracks, one in literature and one in literary and cultural studies) and can integrate into their course of study coursework in anthropology, philosophy, psychoanalysis, gender and race studies, history, political theory, religion, art, music, and film and media studies, among other fields. Qualified students are encouraged to take part in the department's honors program, which culminates in the writing of a senior honors thesis under the supervision of a faculty member. A minor in comparative literature is available for students majoring in a different discipline or field. We also strongly encourage prospective double majors who may seek to combine this humanities major with another, nonhumanities specialty. The department's rigorous teaching and rich curriculum have proved to be excellent preparation for our majors, many of whom have gone on for advanced study of literature at the graduate level or for professional education in law or medicine. Others have pursued successful careers in academia, human rights, translation, international relations, education, publishing, journalism, arts, media, film, performance, and all kinds of creative career options that do not fit into any pre-given professional category. n Professors Emeriti Brathwaite, Javitch, Reiss, Ross, Sieburth University Professor; Professor of Comparative Literature, German, and English BaerUniversity Professor; Professor of Comparative Literature and Africana Studies Diawara University Professor; Professor of Comparative Literature and German RonellProfessors Apter, Basterra, Iampolski, Sanders, X.

While all majors in comparative literature must take four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Literature, our commitment to a global and inter - disciplinary outlook means that the remaining six courses required for the major can be taken in other departments or even, by taking advantage of NYU study away opportunities, on other continents. All students planning to major in comparative literature register with the director of undergraduate studies, who works closely with them to develop a coherent sequence of courses suited to their individual interests. Regular advising sessions with the director of undergraduate studies and a remarkably low student-faculty ratio help our students make the most of the wide range of possibilities that define the major. To take full advantage of the opportunities provided by comparative literature, students are encouraged to declare the major as early in their academic career as possible. In addition, please note that students planning to study away should consult and declare with the director of undergraduate studies well before their departure. Major Track 1: Literature This track of the comparative literature major requires ten 4-point courses (40 points) completed with a grade of C or better and organized as follows: Four courses (16 points) originating in the Department of Comparative Literature. These four courses must be taught by a faculty member of the Department of Comparative Literature on the Washington Square campus; they cannot be cross-listed courses originating in another department.

Honors Program To graduate with honors in the major in comparative literature, a student must maintain at least a 3.65 average in the ten courses required for the major, earn at least a 3.65 overall GPA in the College of Arts and Science, and write a senior honors thesis in his or her final year. At the end of the junior year, each honors student meets with the director of undergraduate studies for initial advisement and approval. Following this approval, a student may write the honors thesis by taking the Senior Seminar course (COLIT-UA 400) in the fall semester and then enrolling in a thesis writing independent study (COLIT-UA 997) in the spring semester. This independent study will generally be conducted under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department of Compara - tive Literature whose area of academic expertise coincides with the focus of the honors thesis. To be awarded honors, a student must complete this two-course sequence and produce a quality senior thesis. The Senior Seminar (COLIT-UA 400) is an 11th course for the major, in addition to the four courses originating in the Department of Comparative Literature and the other six courses for the major. The independent study may count as one of the ten courses required for the major, pending approval from the director of undergraduate studies. Internships The department offers its majors and minors elective credit for internships in publishing, at literary agencies, and at other professional offices.

Davis, Schonberg, Widlund Silver Professors; Professors LeCun, Professors Bloomberg, Clayton, Franchitti, Hull, Kapp, Klukowska, Meyers, Versoza Clinical Assistant Professor BariFACULTYPolicy on Declaration of Major or Minor Students must complete one CSCI-UA course with a recorded grade of C or better before they can declare any major or minor in this department, including the joint majors with data science, mathematics, and economics and the joint minor with mathematics. This policy applies to all NYU students, not just to those matriculated in CAS. Major in Computer Science The major requires twelve 4-point courses (48 points). Requirements include the following five courses (20 points) in the Department of Computer Science: Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102) Computer Systems Organization (CSCI-UA 201) Operating Systems (CSCI-UA 202) Basic Algorithms (CSCI-UA 310) The major also requires two courses (8 points) in mathematics: Discrete Mathematics (MATH-UA 120) Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) Students must also take five elective courses (20 points) to complete the major, selected from courses numbered CSCI-UA 4XX (400 level electives). Students may replace a 400-level elective with one of the following mathematics classes: Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212). Students must choose one calculus track or the other and cannot mix courses from the two tracks. Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) Probability and Statistics (MATH-UA 235) A maximum of two MATH-UA classes can be substituted for 400 level electives. Policies Applying to the Major A grade of C or better is necessary in all courses used to fulfill major requirements; courses graded Pass/Fail do not count toward the major. To enroll in Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) students must first fulfill the prerequisite Introduction to Computer Programming (No Prior Experience) (CSCI-UA 2) or Introduction to Computer Programming (Limited Prior Experience) (CSCI-UA 3). Alternatively, they must first present a score of 3 on the AP Computer Science exam or take a placement test given by the department. Advanced Placement (AP) credit for Computer Science A is the equivalent of CSCI-UA 101 and counts toward the major. However, the AP exam in Computer Science Principles cannot count toward any major or minor in this department. Students who score a 4 or 5 on the AP Computer Science exam may register for Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102). Students are required to take CSCI-UA 101 through CSCI-UA 201 in sequence. CAS students (in any major or minor) are not permitted to take computer science courses in the Tandon School of Engineering. Those interested in the honors program should start the major early enough to take major electives starting in the first semester of junior year. 144 PROGRAM Computer Science / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 145 Those interested in spending a semester away should work out their schedule with an adviser as early as possible.

The undergraduate and graduate programs provide students with an opportunity to develop their craft while working closely with some of the finest poets and novelists writing today. The creative writing program now occupies a lovely townhouse on West 10th Street in the same Greenwich Village neighborhood where so many writers have lived and worked. The Lillian Vernon Creative Writers House allows writers\u2014 both established and emerging\u2014to share their work in an inspiring setting. The program's distinguished faculty of award-winning poets and prose writers represents a wide array of contemporary aesthetics. Our instructors have been the recipients of Pulitzer Prizes, MacArthur Genius, Guggenheim, and NEA fellowships, National Book and National Book Critics Circle awards, Pushcart Prizes, the Whiting Writer's Award, and more. Undergraduates are encouraged to attend the program's reading series, which brings both established and new writers to NYU. Writing prizes, special events, and our undergraduate literary journal, West 10th , further complement our course offerings and provide a sense of community for undergraduate writers.

All students must complete 16 points of coursework in creative writing in order to fulfill the requirements of the minor. The introductory workshop Creative Writing: Introduction to Prose and Poetry (CRWRI-UA 815, 4 points) or the study away course Creative Writing (CRWRI-UA 9815, 4 points) is generally the required foundational course, to be followed by 12 additional points from the program's CRWRI-UA course offerings. However, students who begin their minor by taking one of the program's 8-point summer inten - sives\u2014Writers in New York (CRWRI-UA 818, 819, or 835), Writers in Paris (CRWRI-UA 9818 or 9819), or Writers in Florence (CRWRI-UA 9828 or 9829)\u2014are not required to take the introductory workshop (CRWRI-UA 815, CRWRI-UA 9815, or equivalent). Following completion of one of these 8-point intensives, students may take advanced coursework in the same genre as their summer intensive and/or move directly into an intermediate workshop in an alternative genre. Students may also repeat an 8-credit summer intensive to complete the 16-credit minor. Intermediate and advanced workshops may be taken three times for credit. The creative writing minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0 (C). No credit toward the minor is granted for grades of C-minus or lower, although such grades will be computed into the grade point average of the minor, as well as into the overall grade point average. No course to be counted toward the minor may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. To declare the minor: Students in the College of Arts and Science may declare a creative writing minor by completing the minor declaration form on the program's website. Students in other NYU schools may declare their minors on Albert or as directed by their home schools. The program recommends that all creative writing minors contact the undergraduate programs manager in the semester prior to graduation to verify that their minor declaration is on record and that they have fulfilled (or have enrolled in) all of the appropriate courses for the minor. Policy on Course Substitutions Students may petition to apply a maximum of one outside course toward the minor, either as the introductory prerequisite (equivalent to CRWRI-UA 815 or 9815) or as an elective. An outside course is any NYU creative writing course without a CRWRI-UA rubric. To petition to substitute an outside course, students must complete the course substitution petition form (available on the program's website) and provide the course syllabus (as described on the petition form). The undergraduate programs manager will review the submitted syllabus to verify course level and determine substitution eligibility. Students must petition for course substitution prior to registration. If the program pre-approves a non-NYU course for substitution, it can only be counted toward the minor if 1. the Office of the Associate Dean for Students in CAS has also approved the course credit for transfer, and 2. the student receives a grade of C or better. Study Away Students wishing to begin the creative writing minor while studying away at an NYU site should register for Creative Writing (CRWRI-UA 9815) or, if studying away in the summer, for one of the 8-point intensives offered in Paris and Florence (CRWRI-UA 9818, 9819, 9828, or 9829). These courses are not considered outside courses and will automatically be counted toward the creative 155 155 155 PROGRAM Creative Writing / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 156 writing minor. All other creative writing courses taken away require a petition for substitution and are subject to approval by the program. The minor in creative writing offers an introductory course in poetry and prose, as well as upper-level courses that focus on specific elements of formal and experimental poetry, fiction, and creative nonfiction. In addition to the on-campus creative writing courses offered throughout the year, special January term and summer programs offer students a chance to study intensively and generate new writing in Florence, New York, and Paris.

Creative Writing / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22CENTER FOR Data Science Director, NYU Center for Data Science Professor Kempecds.nyu.edu 60 Fifth Avenue, 7th Floor New York, NY 10011 212-998-3307Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Jones-Rooy Data Science / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 159 OVERVIEWData science is the new language of the 21st century and is a cornerstone of a liberal arts education. Data science skills are also increasingly a requirement for graduates entering the workforce, government, or research. As more academic disciplines, industries, and media outlets rely on data-driven decision making, research, and evidence, being a sophisticated consumer of data, as well as being empowered to analyze and generate discoveries, is naturally becoming a prerequisite for being a global citizen, scientist, and leader. The College of Arts and Science and the NYU Center for Data Science offer a major and minor in data science, and (with the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences) a joint major in computer and data science. The major in data science develops students' broad knowledge in emerging theories and methods of computational statistics in fields within the humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Students who complete the major are exposed to diverse ways of knowing, research and critical thinking skills, and communication and inference techniques, and are trained to become ethically responsible data scientists. The minor in data science teaches foundational computational analysis concepts and how to use data science methods and tools to answer important questions. Students apply those concepts to a range of domain-specific issues that relate to their major course of study. Students in both the major and the minor have opportunities for hands-on experience with real datasets. While students do gain skills in programming due to the computational nature of the field, the major and minor are not centered on professional or vocational training. Instead, the development of skills in the data science curriculum unfolds within a broader context of scientific and theoretical frameworks for understanding and pursuing deeper objectives, novel knowledge generation, and robust discovery. Students may contact cds-undergraduate@nyu.edu with any questions about the major or minor. n Professors Freire (Computer Science, Engineering) Kempe (Computer Science, Mathematics)Silva (Computer Science, Engineering) Spirling (Politics)Associate Professor Cho (Computer Science) Assistant Professors Bowman (Linguistics) Bruna (Computer Science) Fernandez-Granda (Mathematics) He (Computer Science) Lake (Psychology) FACULTY 160 McFee (Music Technology) Niles-Weed (Mathematics) Ranganath (Computer Science) Savin (Neural Science) Stoyanovich (Computer Science, Engineering) Wilson (Computer Science) Associated Faculty Bonneau (Biology, Computer Science) Cranmer (Physics) Dhar (Information Systems) Fergus (Computer Science) Hill (Applied Statistics) Hogg (Physics) Ipeirotis (Information, Operations, and Management Sciences) LeCun (Computer Science, Neural Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering) Provost (Information Systems) Simoncelli (Neural Science, Mathematics, Psychology)Varadhan (Mathematics) Adjunct Professor D'Alessandro Visiting Professors Jones-Rooy, Ponce Instructor Policastro Affiliated Faculty Adoph (Psychology, Neural Science) Bellow (Music, Music Education) Ben Arous (Mathematics) Chen (Information, Operations, and Management Sciences) Choromanska (Electrical and Computer Engineering) Chunara (Computer Science and Engineering) Coruzzi (Biology) Dehejia (Public Policy) (Sociology) Statistics) (Psychology, Neural Science) Hellerstein (Computer Science and Engineering) Jacquet (Environmental Studies) Jagabathula (Information, Operations, and Management Sciences) Kohn (Mathematical Science) Kolm (Mathematics) Lakner (Statistics and Operations Research) Ling (Data Science) Liu (Biostatistics) Loftus (Statistics) Lu (Applied Statistics) Ma (Neural Science, Psychology) Nagler (Politics) Newman (Mathematics) Peherstorfer (Computer Science) Pesaran (Neural Science) Razavian (Population Health, Radiology) Ross (Computer Science) Satijia (Biology) Scott (Applied Statistics) Shasha (Computer Science) Sundararajan (Entrepreneur - ship, Technology, Operations, Statistics) Tabak (Mathematics) Tennebein (Statistics, Actuarial Science) Tucker (Politics) Tuzhilin (Business) Vanden-Eijnden (Mathematics) Zanna (Climate Physics) 160 PROGRAM Policy on Declaration of Major or Minor in Data Science Students must complete one DS-UA course with a recorded grade of C or better before they can declare the major or minor in data science or the joint major in computer and data science. This policy applies to all NYU students, not just to those matriculated in CAS. Students may declare during the declaration period, which is from mid-February to mid-March. Please write to cds-undergraduate@nyu.edu to request the declaration form during this period. For more information, please visit cds.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate-program/ . Major in Data Science The major requires thirteen 4-point courses (52 points) and the completion of any CAS minor. The minor requirement only applies to students pursuing data science as a single major (not applicable for students pursuing a joint or double major).

CAS minors range from four to six courses. This minor requirement only applies to students pursuing data science as a single major. Please note that due to the substantial overlap with computer science, data science majors cannot minor in computer science. Policies Applying to the Major A grade of C or better is necessary in all courses used to fulfill major requirements; courses graded Pass/Fail do not count toward the major. Two courses may be double-counted between the data science major and another major. For permission to double-count more than two courses, students must first request approval from the Center for Data Science ( cds-undergraduate@nyu.edu ). If approved by the CDS, students must then petition CAS Academic Standards (Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 909; 212-998-8140). Advanced Placement credit (or other advanced standing credit by examination) in computer science and calculus is treated exactly as in the majors and minors in computer science and mathematics. Consult the AP and other tables in the admission section of this Bulletin for course equivalencies. Students must check the prerequisites for each course before enrolling. See the section on course offerings for all prerequisites. CAS students (in any major or minor) are not permitted to take computer science courses in the Tandon School of Engineering. Those interested in spending a semester away should work out their schedule with an adviser as early as possible. Sample Program of Study for the Major in Data Science Year One, Fall Term: Data Science for Everyone (DS-UA 111) Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) If required, the prerequisite course Introduction to Computer Programming (No Prior Experience) (CSCI-UA 2) or Introduction to Computer Programming (Limited Prior Experience) (CSCI-UA 3).

The program combines the teaching of languages with the disciplinary study of diverse forms of cultural production and social practices. The curriculum emphasizes multi- and cross-disciplinary approaches to the study of documents, practices, and texts, and their regional and global interconnections. The department offers four-year language sequences in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean designed to facilitate the rapid acquisition of literacy in the target language. Students are encouraged to integrate their acquired language skills with the in-depth study of particular aspects of East Asian civilization through upper-level seminars, independent study, and, for qualified undergraduates, an honors research program. Students graduating from the Department of East Asian Studies go on to pursue a wide variety of professional careers related to the region, or continue their education at the graduate level in related fields. n Major The major in the Department of East Asian Studies (EAS) consists of nine 4-point courses (36 points). Qualified students choose from the two tracks outlined below. Language and Civilization Track Students must complete two courses (8 points) in a language (Chinese, Korean, or Japanese) at the advanced level or above. Elementary and intermediate courses do not count toward the major point total. No compromise on language levels is permitted.Professor Emeritus Harootunian Professors Roberts, X.

Notes Applying to Both Major Tracks Courses must have an East Asian studies course number (EAST-UA) to count toward the EAS major. A grade of C or better is necessary in all courses used to fulfill major requirements; courses graded Pass/Fail do not count toward the major. An upper limit of 16 points can be transferred from outside NYU and applied to the major. This includes non-NYU study away credits, as well as credits from other universities in the United States. Transfer students from other universities should meet with the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) to discuss the number of points they can transfer from their previous institution toward the major. In all cases, transfer credits will be awarded only after CAS (or the appropriate school) has awarded University credit, and only after courses are reviewed at the departmental level for equivalence to NYU-NY standards. Please refer to \"Policy on Transfer Credits and NYU Shanghai and NYU Abu Dhabi Courses,\" below, for additional information. Cantonese, Vietnamese, and Tibetan languages may not be counted toward either major or minor requirements.

East Asian Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF Economics Chair of the Department Professor Ludvigson Director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Menzelas.nyu.edu/econ 19 West Fourth Street, 6th Floor New York, NY 10012-1119 212-998-8900 Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies Clinical Associate Professor Fan Economics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 187 OVERVIEWThe Department of Economics prepares students to understand individual and group decision- making, the structure of markets and economies, and the relationship between regions within the global economy. Although the department is large, its students enjoy an excellent student-faculty rapport. Many of the faculty members are associated with distinguished research institutions. By being able to study with faculty who are actively engaged in research, students learn not only about the fundamentals of economic theory but also how such theory is utilized. They have the opportunity to conduct research on their own. Honors students are required to write an honors thesis under direct faculty supervision. Students majoring in economics have many options open to them after graduation. The major prepares them for graduate school in economics, business management, or public administration. Preprofessional students will find that an economics major not only fosters the discipline medical or law school demands, but provides a solid foundation for these and other careers. Employers and professional schools appreciate the skills acquired by economics students and hire economics majors because they can think quantitatively, qualitatively, and analytically. Studying economics at New York University is especially rewarding because of its urban environment. Students often find career opportunities on Wall Street, at the United Nations, or in various corporate, financial, governmental, agency, and nonprofit institutional settings. n Professors Emeriti Gately, Kirzner, Ordover, Ramsey William R.

Students with permission from the director of undergraduate studies may change from one concentration to the other, but certain rules apply. In either case, no course may be taken for which the student does not have the appropriate prerequisites; this includes mathematics prerequisites. Students should review the Department of Economics website for more information about the major and meet with an adviser in the department to plan their course of study. Advisers are located at 19 West Fourth Street, Rooms 836 and 837. Students are strongly advised to begin this sequential major as early as possible. Ideally, six full semesters are required to complete the major. It is impossible to complete the major in fewer than five semesters. Students considering honors in the major should speak to an economics adviser and complete the statistics requirement as soon as possible. A grade of C or better is required for a course to be counted toward the major, as well as to satisfy the mathematics prerequisites. No course for the major may be taken Pass/Fail. If a student fails a course required for the major, the course must be retaken in the department; a course taken outside the University cannot be substituted for a failed course. Students must pay close attention to the prerequisites for each course, as they are strictly enforced. Students who do not meet the minimum C requirement in a prerequisite course(s) will be de-enrolled at the beginning of each semester. A grade of P, I, or W does not satisfy the minimum grade requirement. Transfer credit toward the major will be awarded on a case-by-case basis. Transfer students must consult the department's website for details. The department requires that all economics majors take an exit exam before graduation. No preparation is necessary, and the grade has no impact on a student's academic record. The exam takes only one hour. Students are contacted by the department in their senior year with logistical details. The results are used by the department to evaluate the major. Advanced Standing Credit Advanced Placement (AP), A Level, International Baccalaureate (IB), or equivalent credits place students out of one or both of Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) and also count towards the total number of courses required for the major or minor. For AP, a score of 4 or 5 is acceptable. For IB, the College accepts only High Level (HL) exams with a score of 6 or 7; for A Level examinations, CAS accepts a score of B or higher. However, AP, A Level, IB, or equivalent credit in statistics is not acceptable for the economics major or minor. In addition, advanced standing credit in calculus does not substitute for either or both semesters of Mathematics for Economics I, II (MATH-UA 211, 212), although students may take a placement exam administered by the Department of Mathematics and attempt to place ahead in\u2014or out of\u2014this required sequence. Policy Concentration The policy concentration of the major in economics is intended for the student who is primarily interested in applying economic analysis to an understanding of economic problems and policies. The elective courses allow students to focus on specific problems and topics that match their Economics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 189 interests and career plans. This concentration corresponds most closely to the economics major that is offered by other leading colleges and universities. It is particularly well suited for students planning careers in law, public policy, business, or any other field in which a thorough understanding of economics is beneficial. Students in the policy concentration can pursue a Ph.D. in economics or finance if they supplement their course work with additional courses in mathematics. The policy concentration requires at least ten courses (40 points) in the Department of Economics. Seven core courses are required: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) Introduction to Microeconomics Intermediate or Microeconomic Analysis 11) Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12) or Macroeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 13) Statistics (ECON-UA 18) or Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) One course chosen from International Economics (ECON-UA 238), Urban Economics (ECON-UA 227), or Money and Banking (ECON-UA 231) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Policy concentration majors must also take three electives in the department. Of these three electives, at most one can be numbered ECON-UA 200-299 and at least two must be numbered ECON-UA 300-399. With permission, students in the policy track will be allowed to take courses from the theory track. A student may choose to take two out of the three courses International Economics (ECON-UA 238), Urban Economics (ECON-UA 227), or Money and Banking (ECON-UA 231). One of them will count toward the core course requirement (above), and the other will count toward the 200-level elective requirement. Mathematics requirement: In addition to the ten ECON-UA courses noted above, policy concen - tration students must complete Mathematics for Economics I and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 211, 212) with a C or better. Advanced Placement (or equivalent) credit in calculus cannot substitute for them and does not allow a student to place ahead in the two-semester sequence. We strongly recommend that students take Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) and Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) in the same semester. Note that Mathematics for Economics I is a prerequisite for Mathematics for Economics II. Prerequisites : Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9), or its equivalent, or placement into either Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) is required for both Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2). Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211), and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) are all required for Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10). Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON-UA 10) are the prerequisites for Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 12). Theory Concentration The theory concentration of the major in economics is intended for the student who wishes to begin the formal study of economic reasoning and master the analytical tools. This concentration relies on a higher level of abstraction and focuses on techniques of economic analysis rather than on the understanding of specific economic problems or institutions. It is particularly well suited Economics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 190 for students who intend to pursue a Ph.D. degree in economics or higher degrees in quantitative fields such as finance. The theory concentration requires at least ten courses (40 points) in the Department of Economics. Six core courses are required: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) Microeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 11) Macroeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 13) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Theory concentration majors must also take four electives in the department. Of these four electives, at most two can be numbered ECON-UA 200-299 and at least two must be numbered ECON-UA 300-399. Mathematics requirement: In addition to the ten ECON-UA courses noted above, theory concen - tration students must complete Mathematics for Economics I and Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 211, 212) with a C or better. Advanced Placement (or equivalent) credit in calculus cannot substitute for them and does not allow a student to place ahead in the two-semester sequence. We strongly recommend that students take Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) and Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) in the same semester. Note that Mathematics for Economics I is a prerequisite for Mathematics for Economics II. Theory concentration majors are not required to take Mathematics for Economics III (MATH-UA 213) unless they are pursuing a joint major between economics and either computer science or mathematics; see below. They may take MATH-UA 213 as an elective. Prerequisites: Students must observe all prerequisites for courses in the theory concentration, as they will be strictly enforced. See course descriptions for prerequisites. Joint Major in Economics and Computer Science This is an interdisciplinary major (twenty-two courses/88 points) offered by the Department of Economics with the Department of Computer Science. Only those students that are following the theory track in economics are eligible to pursue this joint major. The major has requirements in three departments, including mathematics. Students must complete one CSCI-UA course with a recorded grade of C or better before they can declare this joint major (this policy applies to all NYU students, not just to those matriculated in CAS). A grade of C or better is necessary in all courses used to fulfill joint major requirements; courses graded Pass/Fail do not count. Interested students should consult with the directors of undergraduate studies in both departments for additional information. The economics requirements (nine courses/36 points) are as follows: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) Microeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 11) Macroeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 13) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Two ECON-UA theory electives at the 300 level Economics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 191 One additional ECON-UA elective The computer science requirements (nine courses/36 points) are as follows: Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102) Computer Systems Organization (CSCI-UA 201) Operating Systems (CSCI-UA 202) Basic Algorithms (CSCI-UA 310) Plus four computer science electives at the 400 level.

The mathematics requirements (four courses/16 points) are as follows: Discrete Mathematics (MATH-UA 120) Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) Mathematics for Economics III (MATH-UA 213) Joint Major in Economics and Mathematics A joint major (eighteen courses/72 points) is offered by the Departments of Economics and Mathematics. In the economics department, joint majors with mathematics must follow the theory concentration. Nine courses must be taken from each department. A grade of C or better is necessary in all courses used to fulfill joint major requirements; courses graded Pass/Fail do not count. Interested students should consult with the directors of undergraduate studies in both departments for additional information. The economics requirements (nine courses/36 points) are as follows: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2) Microeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 11) Macroeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 13) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20) if not taking Mathematical Statistics (MATH-UA 234) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Plus any three economics elective courses, at least two of which must be theory electives numbered ECON-UA 300-399. Note that students who take MATH-UA 234 instead of ECON-UA 20 for the statistics requirement must take a total of four ECON-UA electives. Of the nine mathematics courses (36 points), the following five are required (note that students must choose one calculus track or the other and cannot mix courses from the two tracks; note further that the Mathematics for Economics sequence is the preferred sequence for this joint major): Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) or Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) or Calculus II (MATH-UA 122 Mathematics for Economics III (MATH-UA 213) or Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) or Honors Calculus III (MATH-UA 129) Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) or Honors Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 148) Analysis (MATH-UA 325) or Honors Analysis I (MATH-UA 328) Economics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 192 Four additional courses must be completed from the following choices: Theory of Probability (MATH-UA 233), Mathematical Statistics (MATH-UA 234), Probability and Statistics (MATH- UA 235), Combinatorics (MATH-UA 240), Theory of Numbers (MATH-UA 248), Mathematics of Finance (MATH-UA 250), Mathematical Modeling (MATH-UA 251), Numerical Analysis (MATH-UA 252), Ordinary Differential Equations (MATH-UA 262), Partial Differential Equations (MATH-UA 263), Chaos and Dynamical Systems (MATH-UA 264), Functions of a Complex Variable (MATH-UA 282), Honors Analysis II (MATH-UA 329), Algebra (MATH-UA 343) or Honors Algebra I (MATH-UA 348). Note that if MATH-UA 235 is taken, then MATH-UA 233 and/or MATH-UA 234 may not be counted toward the major requirements; and if MATH-UA 233 and/or 234 is taken, then MATH-UA 235 may not be counted toward the major requirements. Minor in Economics Students may minor in economics in either the theory or policy concentration. A grade of C or better is required for a course to be counted toward the minor in economics. If a student fails a course required for the minor, the course must be retaken in the department; a course taken outside the University cannot be substituted for a failed course. No course for the minor may be taken as Pass/Fail. Policy minor: At least 24 points (six courses) are to be taken in the Department of Economics, including Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1), Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON- UA 2), Statistics (ECON-UA 18), International Economics (ECON-UA 238), and two additional 4-point courses numbered ECON-UA 200-299. All prerequisites will be strictly enforced, including mathematics prerequisites. Note that Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211), or alternatively Calculus I (MATH-UA 121), is a prerequisite for Statistics (ECON-UA 18) but does not count toward the 24 points required for this minor. Theory minor: At least six courses (24 points) are to be taken in the Department of Economics, including Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1), Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), either Microeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 11) or Macroeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 13), and any other two electives in the theory sequence for which the student has the prerequisites. All prerequisites (including any in MATH-UA courses) will be strictly enforced. Note that Math for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) and Math for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) are prerequisites for Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), Microeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 11), and Macroeconomic Analysis (ECON-UA 13), but do not count toward the 24 points required for the minor. Honors Program in Economics Honors may be taken in either the policy or the theory concentration of the major in economics. Honors students are required to participate in a year-long honors program in their senior year and write a thesis under faculty supervision. Students interested in graduate or professional school are especially urged to pursue honors. Interested students must consult with the director of undergraduate studies for permission to enter the honors program. Ideally, students should speak to the economics department advisers early in their sophomore year to begin planning for honors. A 3.65 overall GPA and a 3.65 average in economics courses are both required. Students who wish to obtain honors register for a three-course sequence beginning no later than the spring semester of their junior year: Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266), Honors Tutorial (ECON-UA 410), and Honors Thesis (ECON-UA 450). When seeking departmental approval to enroll in the Honors Tutorial (ECON-UA 410), each honors student must submit a plan of study Economics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 193 indicating the electives he or she intends to enroll in. At least one advanced elective (ECON-UA 300-399) must be completed prior to, or concurrently with, the Honors Tutorial. Honors students are required to take at least twelve courses (48 points), as outlined below.

There is usually some flexibility concerning the semester in which a given course can be taken, and students with Advanced Placement credit may be able to lighten some of their semester course loads and/or have room for more electives. Detailed programs of study for each of the degree combinations are available on the program website for reference. nDual-Degree Program in Engineering Engineering / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Requirements The dual degree program is designed to meet the educational and career interests of students with strong qualifications, as evidenced by their GPA in high school and by their performance in mathematics and science. Students who rank near the top of their class are especially well suited. Students should have completed a rigorous college preparation program, including mathematics (at least through trigonometry), chemistry, and physics. Students typically begin the dual degree program in the first semester of their first year, and they must be prepared to begin with Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) in the first semester of college. Given the highly structured curricula, transfer into the program after the first year is very difficult. Students must maintain satisfactory performance and must complete the required courses in a timely fashion to remain in the program. Their records are reviewed yearly by a faculty committee. The Program Students in the dual degree program spend their first three years of study primarily in the College of Arts and Science. In the first year at the College, the different curricula require many of the same foundational courses. This gives students time to consult with faculty in both CAS and the NYU Tandon School of Engineering before committing themselves to a particular dual degree combination. In the first three years of the program, students satisfy their College Core Curriculum requirements (except foreign language) and take some of the engineering courses in their field of interest. This is also when students select a major area from the CAS disciplines of biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics. After an orientation program in the spring of the third year, the final two years of study are undertaken at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in downtown Brooklyn, across the East River and a short subway or shuttle bus ride from NYU's Greenwich Village campus. Here, students complete the remaining technical courses required for their engineering major. Programs in engineering available to students in the dual degree program include chemical and biomolecular engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. For lists of the CAS and Tandon courses that are required in each of the dual degree combinations, as well as sample five-year plans of study, please consult cas.nyu.edu/engineering . Students may elect to withdraw from the dual degree program in engineering and complete only the College of Arts and Science Core and major requirements, thus earning one undergraduate degree from CAS. If students elect to withdraw from the dual degree program and remain in CAS, they are no longer exempt from the CAS foreign language requirement and must factor that into their academic planning. Also, if students elect to withdraw from the dual degree program and remain in CAS, any Tandon courses taken will count against each student's 16-point allowance in the other divisions of NYU and cannot be applied to the 64-point UA residency requirement. 202 PROGRAM 203 Students should first consult the lists of Tandon School of Engineering and College of Art and Science courses required for each of the dual degree combinations and the recommended five-year plans of study at cas.nyu.edu/ engineering . Descriptions of the CAS courses in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and physics may be found in this Bulletin under their respective sections. For descriptions of the Tandon courses in chemical and biomolecular engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, consult the Tandon website and Bulletin. 203 COURSES Engineering / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF English Chair of the Department Professor ArcherDirector of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Deer English / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 204 as.nyu.edu/english 244 Greene Street New York, NY 10003-4573 212-998-8800 OVERVIEWThe study of English and American literature provides the kind of training that is central to a liberal arts education and useful in all professions. By learning to read critically and write with analytical precision, students who major in English prepare themselves to participate actively in their culture while forging a lifelong, enriching relationship with literature. The department offers two tracks in the major: the literature track and the creative writing track. Students take courses in a variety of historical periods as well as in a variety of topics and areas (such as literary history, critical theory, and literary culture). The major also provides opportuni - ties for specialized research through seminars, independent study, and an honors program that culminates in the writing of a scholarly thesis during the senior year. In the major's creative writing track, seniors can produce a special creative project in poetry, prose, or a hybrid genre. The department's Contemporary Literature Series brings noted authors to campus and into the classroom and includes an undergraduate CLS Fellows program that provides students with training in literary arts management. The department also offers its majors and minors a cred - it-bearing internship seminar for placements at magazines, publishers, literary agencies, and other organizations. n Professors Emeriti Carruthers, Collins, Donoghue, Griffin, Halpern, Haverkamp, Lockridge, Maynard, Poovey, Silverman Seryl Kushner Dean of the College of Arts and Science; Professor of English Jarrett Henry W. and Albert A.

Environmental Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22CENTER FOR European and Mediterranean Studies Director of the Center Professor Grossas.nyu.edu/cems 53 Washington Square South, Floor 3E New York, NY 10012 212-998-3838 European and Mediterranean Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 224 OVERVIEW PROGRAMThe Center for European and Mediterranean Studies (CEMS) offers an interdisciplinary major and minor focusing on contemporary patterns of politics, culture, and society, as well as on historical developments in Europe and the European-Mediterranean region. Majors may choose to write a senior honors thesis to conduct one-on-one research with CEMS faculty. Advanced knowledge of a European language and a semester of study in one of NYU's European sites are required of all majors to help ensure a deeper understanding of the culture and institutions of a country in the European or Mediterranean region. Although open to all students, the minor is especially suited to majors in European languages, history, or the social sciences. CEMS offers and supports a wide array of activities, including lectures, workshops, and conferences dealing with both Western and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region. Both the major and minor are designed for students seeking pre-professional training for careers in international business and finance, diplomacy, international law, and cultural organizations dealing with Europe and the Mediterranean. Alumni have also pursued graduate and PhD studies in a variety of fields, as well as legal education. n Major: General Information With the guidance of the European and Mediterranean studies adviser, students prepare a preliminary program outline at the time they declare their major. Although there are no formal tracks, courses are normally organized around the interests of a student in one of two ways: an emphasis on European and Mediterranean societies (past and present)\u2014their challenges and policies;Max Weber Chair for German and European Studies Martin Professors Fleming (History) Geppert (History) Wolff (History)Associate Professors Gross (History/European and Mediterranean Studies) Shaw (European and Mediterr - nean Studies/Philosophy) Faculty Fellows Aron, Samara Affiliated Faculty Etmektsoglou (NYU Berlin) George (German Studies) Geroulanos (History) Pehe (NYU Prague) Williams (International Relations) FACULTY 225 or an emphasis on European and Mediterranean cultures (past and present)\u2014their ideas, values, and artistic and literary trends. The program enables students to organize their courses around a practical or theoretical challenge in contemporary or historical European society or culture that is applicable to one or several countries. Examples of such challenges include: the changing impact of politics on culture and social cleavages; changing patterns of religious expression in Europe; literary expression and social change in Europe; the European approach to urban problems; migration and ethnicity in Europe; equality and inequality in Europe; and democratic transition in Europe. For honors track students, the challenge will serve as the basis for the senior honors thesis. Major: Program of Study Ten 4-point courses (40 points) beyond the introductory level that focus on Europe and the Mediterranean region must be completed with a C or better, as follows: Two courses in history Two courses in culture (literature, philosophy, art history, or cinema) Two courses in the social sciences (politics, anthropology, sociology, or economics) Three additional courses in any of the three preceding categories One advanced seminar, Contemporary Europe (EURO-UA 950), taken in fall of senior year Majors in European and Mediterranean studies must demonstrate advanced-level knowledge of a major European language other than English (such as French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Greek, Russian, or Turkish). To demonstrate this knowledge, students must successfully complete one advanced-level language course. The alternative is to take a College of Arts and Science (CAS) placement exam and demonstrate proficiency above the intermediate level. Majors are also required to complete at least one semester of study away. Minor All students minoring in European and Mediterranean studies must demonstrate proficiency in at least one European language above the intermediate level (such as French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Greek, Russian, or Turkish). They must also complete four 4-point courses (16 points) with a C or better as follows: one course in European history; one course in European culture (literature, philosophy, art history, or cinema); one course in social sciences (politics, anthropology, sociology, or economics); and one additional course in any of the three preceding categories. All course programs must be designed in consultation with the center's undergraduate program adviser. Honors Program A degree in European and Mediterranean studies with honors is awarded to students who complete the ten courses (40 points) outlined above, who maintain a GPA of 3.65 (both overall and in the major), and who successfully complete original research leading to an honors thesis. The honors thesis, which counts as the 11th course for the major, is researched and written while registered in Independent Study (EURO-UA 998) during the spring semester of the student's senior year under the supervision of a program faculty member. The thesis topic and the faculty adviser are chosen in consultation with the instructor of the advanced seminar Contemporary Europe (EURO-UA 950), taken during the fall semester of the student's senior year. The average length of the thesis is 40-60 pages. European and Mediterranean Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 226 B.A./M.A. Program This program offers qualifying majors in European and Mediterranean studies the opportunity to earn both the B.A. and the M.A. degrees at reduced tuition cost. By completing some of their graduate requirements while still undergraduates, students can finish the program in five years. Majors may apply for admission to the program after they have completed at least 48 points in the College, but not more than 96 credits or six semesters. Applications are reviewed by the Graduate Admission Committee of the Center for European and Mediterranean Studies using the normal criteria for the M.A. program, except that applicants are not required to take the GRE. The committee bases its decision on students' undergraduate records and recommendations of NYU instructors. Eight graduate courses are required. For majors who completed the honors program, the master's thesis may be a revision of the senior honors thesis. European and Mediterranean studies is an interdisciplinary major. Students are encouraged to choose courses from across the College and University as they plan their program of study. However, they must always consult with a major adviser to confirm that a course or courses will count toward this major. Futures of the Twentieth Century EURO-UA 645 Geppert. 4 points.

European and Mediterranean Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Expository Writing / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Expository Writing Program An NYU and CAS education begins, in part, with writing. This practice reflects the University's longstanding commitment to the centrality of written inquiry to undergraduate education. Expository writing courses at NYU teach students to move from answering teachers' questions to responding to questions and problems that they themselves identify. To this end, students learn to use writing as a flexible tool for: exploring ideas; taking intellectual and creative risks; analyzing data (sources, text, visual material, or empirical data); making and rethinking observations; and investigating questions and curiosities. Students also learn to think of writing as a process of consciously crafting a text that purposefully communicates an idea, finding, result, insight, or interpretation to a specific imagined audience. In addition to required writing courses for students in the College of Arts and Science, Rory Meyers College of Nursing, Silver School of Social Work, Tisch School of the Arts, Stern School of Business, and Tandon School of Engineering, the Expository Writing Program offers elective courses for students seeking to continue their exploration of the essay genre or to develop their understanding of how to communicate ideas effectively to a broad and diverse audience. ncas.nyu.edu/ewp 411 Lafayette Street, 4th Floor New York, NY 10003-7032 212-998-8860 228 Executive Director and Assistant Vice Dean for General Education Professor Quilter Associate Director and Director of International Writing Clinical Professor Martone Director of Faculty Development Clinical Associate Professor Mickelson Director of the Writing Center Clinical Professor Morgan Director of Writing in the Sciences and Engineering Clinical Associate Professor Rabinowitz Director of Writing in the Disciplines Clinical Assistant Professor Mischkot OVERVIEW FACULTY Clinical Professors Martone, Morgan Clinical Associate Professors Mickelson, Mischkot, Quilter, Rabinowitz Senior Language Lecturers Anderson, L., Anderson, Beebe, Bernhardt, Weinert-Kendt, Weiss 229 Expository Writing / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22All College of Arts and Science students must satisfy the expository writing requirement by taking: Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1); or International Writing Workshop I and II (EXPOS-UA 4 and 9), for qualifying English as a second language (ESL) students; or Writing I and II (WRI-UF 1001 and 2002 in the Liberal Studies Program), for HEOP/C-STEP students. Special sections of EXPOS-UA 1 are offered and vary by semester. One cohort for pre-professional health and science majors is focused on the theme of science, health, and technology. Two other streamed sections are available as part of the Residential College at Goddard and special floors at Rubin. These sections are linked to topical \"streams\" (e.g., \"Writing New York\") and are available by application only for students in those residence streams. Writing Tutorial (EXPOS-UA 13) provides additional work in writing for undergraduates and is required for transfer students who do not successfully complete the University's writing proficiency exam requirement. There are no exemptions from the College's expository writing requirement. International and English as a Second Language Students In CAS, for most students, Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1) fulfills the College Core Curriculum writing requirement. Writing the Essay requires frequent analytical and reflective writing, which is common in other courses throughout NYU. The writing and reading assignments are challenging even for native speakers of English, and require them to develop conceptual frameworks for their arguments and ideas by working with a wide range of sophisticated and complex sources at a pace comfortable for most native speakers. NYU recognizes that international students come with varying levels of language competency and fluency and require more time to complete challenging reading and writing assignments. For international students, there are alternate pathways to satisfying the Core writing requirement. 1) International students who attended English-language high schools for four years may be uncertain about the default placement into Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1). For those students, an option is placement within the International Writing sequence, beginning with International Writing Workshop 1 (EXPOS-UA 4), followed by International Writing Workshop 2 (EXPOS-UA 9). The expectations for International Writing Workshop 1 and 2 are the same as for Writing the Essay, but the classes are smaller and there is more time (two semesters) to complete the curriculum. For help determining whether Writing the Essay or International Writing Workshop 1 is the better choice for international students who attended English-language high schools, please visit the Expository Writing Program webpage: ewp.cas.nyu.edu . 2) International students who did not attend English-language high schools for four years are asked to take a survey designed to determine appropriate placement. Based on their survey responses, these students may be placed into International Writing Workshop: Introduction (EXPOS-UA 3), which is followed by International Writing Workshop I (EXPOS-UA 4) and then by International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9). The preliminary course, International Writing Workshop: Introduction, is taught in an environment where gaining fluency in reading, writing, and speaking in English is an expected part of the coursework, and offers the international student more time and support for reading, writing, and speaking. It is possible for students in International Writing Workshop: Introduction to be reevaluated at the end of the course for possible waiver of PROGRAM 230 230 Expository Writing / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22International Writing Workshop I (EXPOS-UA 4) and direct placement into International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9). For questions about survey results, please consult with your adviser and the survey team: ewp-writingsurvey@nyu.edu .

Expository Writing / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 Foundations of Contemporary Culture Director of the College Core Curriculum and Vice Dean of General Education Professor Siegal cas.nyu.edu/core Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 903 New York, NY 10003 212-998-8119Director of the Foundations of Contemporary Culture Clinical Professor Renzi Foundations of Contemporary Culture / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 232 OVERVIEWThe Foundations of Contemporary Culture (FCC) sequence of the College Core Curriculum seeks to provide students with perspective and intellectual methods to comprehend the development of our human cultures. The four FCC courses introduce students to the modes of inquiry by which societies may be studied, social issues analyzed, and artistic activity explored. Together, they give undergraduates a broad methodological background on which to draw when later engaged in the more focused work of their major courses of study. As a result, students receive a richer education than any single major could provide. Through this core experience in humanistic and social-scientific inquiry the FCC framework allows students to enter into dialogue with one another despite differences in their course schedules, and in this way also encourages lifelong habits of intellectual curiosity and engagement. As they learn the sound employment of the academic approaches at the center of their FCC classes, students develop their abilities to read critically, think rigorously, and write effectively. By building these skills and an appreciation of the diversity of human experience, the FCC seeks to prepare students for their continued learning in and beyond college, for active participation in their communities, and for lives in a rapidly changing world. All FCC courses are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished professors. In addition to two lectures a week, every FCC course includes weekly recitation sections, allowing for small-group discussion of the readings, close attention to students' written work, and personal concern for students' progress. n Prerequisites and Sequencing During their first year, students normally complete a class from Texts and Ideas (CORE-UA 4XX) and one from Cultures and Contexts (CORE-UA 5XX), in either order. In the sophomore year, students choose an approved departmental offering for Societies and the Social Sciences and take Expressive Culture (CORE-UA 7XX), again in either order. Students should complete the first-year FCC classes and the expository writing requirement before proceeding to the sophomore-level classes. Students in the International Writing Workshop sequence should not start their course work in the FCC until they have completed International Writing Workshop I (EXPOS-UA 4).PROGRAM 233 Exemptions and Substitutions Because of the importance the faculty places on assuring every student a core experience in the Foundations of Contemporary Culture, there are no exemptions or substitutions for Texts and Ideas or Cultures and Contexts. Students who complete a designated major or minor program in the social sciences are exempt from Societies and the Social Sciences. Those who complete a designated major or minor program in the humanities are exempt from Expressive Culture. Students who complete majors in each area, who complete a joint major designated in both areas, or who complete a major in one area and a minor in the other, may satisfy both components. A list of the area designations of major and minor programs in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) may be found on the Core Curriculum website. CAS students can also satisfy Societies and the Social Sciences by completing an approved depart - mental course. For a current list of approved courses, consult the Core Curriculum website.

Citizens of the 21st century need competence and confidence in dealing with the approaches and findings of science if they are to make informed decisions on vital political, economic, and social issues. Rather than striving for encyclopedic coverage of facts, Foundations of Scientific Inquiry (FSI) courses in the College Core Curriculum stress the process of scientific reasoning and seek to illustrate the role of science and mathematics in our understanding of the natural world. They give students who will not be science majors a positive experience in scientific inquiry and encourage learning about how science is done. The quantitative component of these courses emphasizes the critical role of mathematics in the analysis of natural phenomena. The courses within FSI are organized into three groups: Quantitative Reasoning, Physical Science, and Life Science. All lectures are taught by regular faculty, including some of the University's most distinguished professors, and each course includes a weekly workshop or laboratory section. n Prerequisites and Sequencing Students complete one course in Quantitative Reasoning (CORE-UA 1XX), one course in Physical Science (CORE-UA 2XX), and one course in Life Science (CORE-UA 3XX). Quantitative Reasoning (QR) is not a prerequisite for Physical Science or Life Science courses. However, QR should be completed in the freshman year and no later than the sophomore year. Students may take Physical Science and Life Science in either order. Students should aim to complete both courses before the end of their sophomore year. Exemptions and Substitutions Students who complete a major in the natural sciences, the prehealth curriculum, or the combined dual-degree program in engineering are exempt from the Foundations of Scientific Inquiry require - ments.

French Literature, Thought, and Culture / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22MAJOR/MINOR IN Gender and Sexuality Studies Director of Gender and Sexuality Studies Professor Gopinath as.nyu.edu/genderandsexuality 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor New York, NY 10003-7112 212-992-9650 Gender and Sexuality Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 253 OVERVIEW PROGRAMHoused in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis, the program in gender and sexuality studies (GSS) fosters broad interdisciplinary investigation of gender and sexuality as key aspects of human experience both past and present, paying particular attention to how they shape social roles and identities in various cultural contexts. Its curriculum makes gender and sexuality central rather than peripheral terms of analysis, while also considering their significance both vis-\u00e0-vis each other and in relation to race, ethnicity, locality, nation, and geographic circulation. Most fundamentally, the program encourages students to question gender and sexual norms wherever they are in effect, and thus to complicate what in many other settings\u2014both academic and non-academic\u2014is often presented as \"natural.\" In this way, GSS contests the privileging of some categories (e.g., male or heterosexual ) over others, and thereby challenges the social and political implications of such hierarchies. n Major The gender and sexuality studies major requires nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better. Two introductory courses\u2014may be taken in either order: Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101) Approaches to Gender and Sexuality Studies (SCA-UA 401; offered occasionally) or Intersections: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in U.S. History (SCA-UA 230; offered every fall) Six elective courses: Six designated gender and sexuality studies electives, of which four must be taught by SCA faculty.Professors Emeriti Pratt, Stacey Erich Maria Remarque Professor of Assistant Professor LeeFACULTY 254 SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program (SCA-UA 42) is no longer required but is highly recommended and can count as an elective. One research course: Advanced Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90) Minor Five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better are required for the minor in gender and sexuality studies. Students must take one of the following introductory courses: Approaches to Gender and Sexuality Studies (SCA-UA 401; offered occasionally) or Intersections: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in U.S. History (SCA-UA 230; offered every fall). They also take four designated gender and sexuality studies electives, of which two must be taught by SCA faculty. Language and Linguistic Competency The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within and across different social groups. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in language and linguistics by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; studying languages especially germane to the department's fields of study; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. Policy on Double Counting of Courses Majors may share (double count) two courses with a second major, with permission from the other department/program. Minors may share (double count) one course with a major or a second minor, with permission from the other department/program. Honors Program Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year. Upon successful completion of the seminar requirement, students will be eligible to register for Senior Honors Thesis (SCA-UA 93) in the spring.

Gender and Sexuality Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF German Chair of the Department Professor Strowick Director of Undergraduate Studies Assistant Professor Georgeas.nyu.edu/german 19 University Place New York, NY 10003-4573 212-998-8650Director of the Language Program Clinical Assistant Professor Dortmann German / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 258 OVERVIEWThe department's undergraduate program offers a broad range of courses in the language, cultures, and literatures of German-speaking countries. The department offers a major in German literature and culture, a joint major in German and linguistics, a joint major in German and global liberal studies, and a minor in German language. Along with its German language program, the department offers interdisciplinary courses taught in English that address issues of German culture, history, philosophy, art, and literature for students not yet proficient in the German language. The department sponsors a monthly lunch series, tutoring, and the activities of the German club \"Goethes Tisch,\" as well as a series of annual awards in recognition of outstanding achievement by undergraduate students in the study of German language and literature. Deutsches Haus, the German cultural center at NYU, provides a varied program of films, concerts, lectures, and exhibitions. The Department of German places high priority on fostering personal contact between faculty and students, maintains small class sizes (15 or fewer students, on average), and offers comfortable spaces for socializing, studying, and holding informal meetings. Advanced courses and some basic language courses are taught by full-time faculty members, all of whom are also involved in student advising. n OVERVIEW Major in German: General Information The prerequisite for entering all majors in the department is completion of German language training through the full intermediate level (GERM-UA 4 or GERM-UA 20). Students who have equivalent language training or proficiency may satisfy the prerequisite with the CAS placement examination. Students who wish to major or minor in German must register with the department Professors Emeriti Guilloton, H\u00fcppauf University Professors Baer, RonellProfessors de Vries, Krauss, Strowick, Wood Associate Professors Ulfers, WeatherbyAssistant Professor George Clinical Assistant Professor DortmannLanguage Lecturer Densky Global Distinguished Professors Bal, Bronfen, iekFACULTY 259 and have their programs approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Majors and minors will be assigned a departmental adviser, usually the director of undergraduate studies, with whom they should consult before registering each semester. Major in German: Requirements The major in German literature and culture consists of eight 4-point courses (32 points) at the 100 level or higher, three of which may be in English and represent a coherent area of concentration (such as history, politics, or philosophy); courses in English outside of the department must have approval of the program adviser. No courses may be counted toward the requirements of another major or minor. All courses must be completed with a grade of C or better (Pass/Fail grades do not count). The eight courses must be at the 100 level or above (elementary and intermediate language courses do not count) and are to be distributed as follows: Two required courses: German Conversation and Composition (GERM-UA 111) Introduction to German Literature (GERM-UA 152) Six 200- or 300-/400-level courses, of which a maximum of three can be at the 200 level (i.e., taught in English). Students are strongly encouraged to fulfill some of the program requirements through a semester or year of study away, either at NYU Berlin or NYU Prague. Students eligible for honors are required to pursue a two-semester, 8-point sequence in which they take the Honors Seminar (GERM-UA 999) in the fall and the Honors Thesis (GERM-UA 500) in the spring of their senior year. (See \"honors program,\" below, for details.) With the permission of the director of undergraduate studies, up to 4 points of independent study or internship work may also be counted toward the major. Major in German and Linguistics This joint major requires a total of nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better. The German part of this major is satisfied by taking four 4-point courses (16 points) beyond the intermediate level: One advanced conversation or composition course chosen from: German Conversation and Composition (GERM-UA 111) Advanced Composition and Grammar (GERM-UA 114) Introduction to German Literature (GERM-UA 152) Two advanced literature courses taught in German (300- or 400-level) The linguistics part of this major is satisfied by taking the following five 4-point courses (20 points): Either Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 3) Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) And a total of two additional courses from two different fields of linguistics, chosen from the following: Historical linguistics (LING-UA 14) Sociolinguistics (LING-UA 15, LING-UA 18, LING-UA 30, LING-UA 38, LING-UA 57) German / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 260 Phonology (LING-UA 12) Semantics LING-UA 43, LING-UA 54, LING-UA 59) Structure of a modern language (LING-UA 10, LING-UA 42, LING-UA 44, LING-UA 9032) Minor in German The minor program requires five 4-point courses (20 points) taught in German and completed with a grade of C or better (Pass/Fail does not count), as follows: A minimum of two courses (8 points) at the 100 level. A minimum of one course (4 points) at the 300 or 400 level. Elementary German I and II (GERM-UA 1, 2) do not count toward the minor. Honors Program in German Majors in German can be admitted to the program on the basis of superior work after at least two semesters of study in German at the advanced level. The minimum eligibility requirements are cumulative and major GPAs of 3.65. Both the director of undergraduate studies and the director of the honors program review all applications, which are due no later than spring of junior year and must include an unmarked copy of a paper submitted for a German major course. In the senior year, students accepted to the honors program complete a two-course, 8-credit sequence, consisting of Senior Honors Seminar (GERM-UA 999) in the fall semester and Honors Thesis (GERM-UA 500) in the spring semester. The Senior Honors Seminar is a small workshop with a primary focus on research, methodology, and academic writing. Students also learn strategies for grant writing and presentation. Honors majors define a thesis topic, develop a bibliography, read broadly in their area, and begin their research and writing. A substantial portion of the research, usually including a rough draft of one-third to one-half of the thesis, should be completed by semester's end. During the spring semester of the senior year, students enroll in Honors Thesis (GERM-UA 500). In close consultation with the thesis advisor, students work on completing research, a final draft, and revisions of the thesis. Students also choose a second reader, typically another faculty member from the department. In cases of an interdisciplinary thesis, the second reader may be from another department. The finished thesis must be a work of scholarship and/or criticism in the field of German studies and should be between 40 and 60 double-spaced pages in length. If it is written in English, the student must also write an abstract of five to seven pages in German. There will also be an oral presentation of the senior thesis with the student's two readers. In consultation with the second reader, the student's advisor determines whether or not to recommend him or her for honors. A grade of at least A-minus is required for the award of honors in German. Students receiving a lower grade will simply be awarded 8 credits of coursework towards the major. Departmental Awards The Department of German sponsors two annual awards in recognition of excellence and achievement in the study of German: the Auguste Ulfers Memorial Prize and the Ernst Rose-G. C. L. Schuchard Anniversary Prize. For further information, see the honors and awards section of this Bulletin. German / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 261 Combined B.A./M.A. Program in German The accelerated B.A./M.A. program in German is designed to prepare students for career choices requiring advanced knowledge of German language, literature, and culture or a sophisticated understanding of the German intellectual and critical traditions. The four-year undergraduate component of the program includes one semester of study away. Students majoring in German may apply after completion of 48 points of undergraduate work, with at least 16 of these points completed at NYU, but not more than 96 points. They must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies for application to the combined degree program. Students must meet the following minimum requirements for admission: a GPA of at least 3.5 overall and at least 3.6 in German; satisfactory completion at NYU (by the start of the first semester in the program) of at least two 4-point courses in German at the advanced level; and evidence of overall language competency in German, sufficient for successful advanced undergraduate and graduate study. Undergraduates accepted into the B.A./M.A. program are required to spend at least one semester studying away in one of the NYU exchange programs in a German-speaking country. The study away requirement may be waived by the department in consideration of special circumstances. Summer study in an approved program may be used to satisfy the study away requirement. Students are required at the end of the fifth year of the program to submit a master's thesis, which should represent the culmination of a longer-term research effort. Facilities and Activities Deutsches Haus at NYU: Located directly across the street from the department at 42 Washington Mews, Deutsches Haus provides a broad program of cultural and intellectual enrichment for students of German through lectures, concerts, films, exhibitions, and readings. Deutsches Haus offers students many opportunities to meet, practice their German, and learn from prominent artistic, literary, business, and political figures of German-speaking countries. German Club (Goethes Tisch): This student-run group is open to interested undergraduates at all levels of German language ability. Goethes Tisch sponsors several activities each month during the academic year, including conversation hours, films, restaurant visits, and parties. Study Away Students pursuing the major in German are strongly encouraged to complete some of the requirements by spending a semester or year away. NYU Berlin : This semester- or year-long study away program is affiliated with the prestigious Humboldt University, located in the heart of the city. Course offerings focus on the society, politics, history, and culture of Germany, as well as contemporary Western Europe. The program features NYU courses, taught by NYU faculty, members of the Humboldt faculty, and Berlin's wider academic community. The program is designed for students of German, as well as history and the social sciences. All content courses, taught in English, will count either for credit in the department in which they are listed or toward the three courses in English allowed as part of the German literature and culture major. Several advanced content courses taught in German are offered each year and are applicable toward the major. At least one course must be taken in German. NYU Prague: This semester- or year-long study away program is located in the heart of central Europe. Course offerings focus on the society, politics, history, and culture of this region. The German / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 262 program features NYU courses, taught by NYU faculty, and Prague's wider academic community. The program is designed for students of German, as well as history, the social sciences, and business. German language courses from elementary to intermediate are offered at NYU Prague, as well as one post-intermediate course. Exchange programs: NYU students can participate in exchanges with universities in Berlin (Freie or Humboldt University), Bonn, or Vienna. NYU financial aid can be applied to the costs of living and studying at any of these exchange institutions, and NYU academic credit is awarded directly for courses taken. Students may study away for one semester or a full year, usually in the junior year, with the approval of the major department(s). The minimum requirement for any of the exchange programs is successful completion of 64 points of undergraduate course work and a 3.0 GPA. Both programs in Berlin require proficiency in German; the programs in Bonn and Vienna offer some courses in English. Arts and Science Summer in Berlin: The department offers a six-week summer program in Berlin. The program consists of language courses and culture courses (in English), which may be applied to the major or minor. COURSES Placement in German Language Courses All students with previous study of German must take the online CAS placement examination before registering for their first course in this language. The departmental placement process consists of a consultation with the director of language programs to choose the level of language instruction most appropriate to the individual student's needs and abilities. Fulfillment of the College Core Curriculum Language Requirement The department offers courses allowing students to complete the College of Arts and Science language requirement. Students may choose either the extensive sequence of four 4-point courses (Elementary I and II followed by Intermediate I and II) or the intensive sequence of two 6-point courses (intensive Elementary followed by Intensive Intermediate). Students planning to major in German are advised to follow the intensive sequence. Basic Language Courses in German All German language courses use communicative methodology. Elementa - ry-level courses introduce students to essential linguistic and social conventions of contemporary spoken German, with an emphasis on establishing conversational skills. Intermediate level courses introduce more complex features of the language and focus on building reading and writing skills, while continuing to develop conversational ability.

This unique structure responds to the ever-increasing demand for interdisciplinary public health practitioners both in the U.S. and abroad. The coursework is integrated with experiential learning and study away requirements to ensure that students are broadly trained and uniquely prepared for a variety of careers. The majors' global public health courses are offered by the NYU College of Global Public Health (665 Broadway, 11th Floor; 212-992-6741; publichealth.nyu.edu ). GPH delivers truly interdisciplinary public health education at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral level. It builds on the global reach of NYU's unique Global Network University; draws strength from the entrepreneurial spirit of NYU's many talented faculty and students; and serves as a conduit for groundbreaking research and education that advances and promotes equitable health for all. n PROGRAM Overview and Global Public Health Core Courses Students in CAS may choose one of the following combinations for a GPH major: Global public health/anthropology (B.A.) Global public health/history (B.A.) Global public health/sociology (B.A.) Global public health and science (B.S., with a choice of two concentrations): Biology concentration Chemistry concentration In all of these majors, students must take six 4-point courses (24 points) in the core public health areas: Health and Society in a Global Context (UGPH-GU 10) 268 Biostatistics for Public Health (UGPH-GU 20). (This satisfies the College Core Curriculum requirement in Quantitative Reasoning.) Epidemiology for Global Health (UGPH-GU 30) Health Policy in a Global World (UGPH-GU 40) Environmental Health in a Global World (UGPH-GU 50) Undergraduate Experiential Learning in Global Public Health (UGPH-GU 60) Students entering into the GPH combined major as of Spring 2020 are required to complete UGPH-GU 10 as either a prerequisite or corequisite to/with UGPH 20, 30, 40, or 50. In the GPH/biology concentration, students substitute a BIOL-UA course in biostatistics for UGPH-GU 20 (see details below). Besides these six required GPH courses, students also take courses in their chosen field within CAS, with the exact number of courses varying by major and concentration (see below for the exact requirements for each track). Students fill out their coursework with two relevant electives in global public health and/or the CAS disciplinary field (chosen in consultation with a CAS departmental adviser to address individual interests and career paths). Every combined GPH major must take one course in a foreign language past the intermediate level and study away for one semester at an NYU global academic center. The language requirement is set by CAS, not by the College of Global Public Health. To satisfy the requirement, students may also use AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of one course above intermediate two. Alternatively, they may take an NYU language placement exam and place into the second course above intermediate two. Programs of study are planned with the director of undergraduate studies in the chosen CAS department in consultation with a global public health advisor. The e-mail address for general inquiries from CAS students is cas.gph@nyu.edu . General Policies Applying to the Combined Global Public Health Majors CAS students are allowed to count 16 points from the other schools of the University toward the baccalaureate degree. Four of the six core UGPH-GU courses required for the combined GPH majors are treated as liberal arts courses and therefore do not count against the 16-point allowance: UGPH-GU 10, 20, 30, and 50. (These four courses are exempt from the 16-point rule both for declared GPH majors and also for CAS students who simply take one or more of them as electives.) The two required GPH core courses UGPH-GU 40 and 60 are not exempt from the 16-point rule, and together use up 8 points of each student's 16-point allowance. Any other UGPH-GU courses besides 10, 20, 30, and 50 will also count against the 16 points. Students may petition for additional non-CAS, non-liberal arts credits beyond the 16-point limit through the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. No UGPH-GU courses can count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. Students must earn a C or better in all courses for their combined major and maintain a 2.0 major GPA. Courses graded Pass/Fail cannot be counted toward the major. The GPH tracks with anthropology, history, and sociology all satisfy the College Core Curriculum requirement in Societies and the Social Sciences. However, the two GPH concentrations in science do not satisfy this requirement. None of the UGPH-GU courses can exempt students from any part of the Core's Foundations of Contemporary Culture. Global Public Health / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 269 Transfer Student Policies Applying to the Combined Global Public Health Majors Transfer students to CAS must complete at least half of their entire combined GPH major at NYU, with at least half of the CAS coursework required for the major completed at NYU. In addition, GPH requires that transfer credit cannot be used for more than one of the six core GPH require - ments (the other five must always be completed at NYU). The internship course (UGPH-GU 60) can never be satisfied with transfer credit. Applicants to schools of the health professions who are pursuing one of the science GPH majors must complete at least five of the required prehealth science courses at NYU in order to be eligible for a committee interview and letter from the CAS Preprofessional Advising Center. Some transfer students may therefore be required to complete more than half of their GPH major at NYU to satisfy these policies, regardless of transfer coursework presented. Global Public Health/Anthropology The major provides interdisciplinary training that embraces the natural convergence of society, culture, and health, and draws on the Department of Anthropology's strength in bridging the social sciences, natural sciences, and humanities. A major in global public health and anthropology prepares students to analyze various cultural traditions through the lens of health; to examine complex relationships within economic, political, cultural, physical, and biological environments; and to apply anthropological approaches to public health problems. The major is designed to prepare students for multidisciplinary careers in a variety of settings and/or for advanced academic training in public health, anthropology or other related fields. This major requires fifteen 4-point courses (60 points) completed with a C or better, as follows. Six required 4-point UGPH-GU courses (24 points; as outlined above) One foreign language course past the intermediate two level (4 points). This requirement is set by CAS, not by the College of Public Health (GPH). Students who present AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of at least one course above intermediate two have satisfied the requirement. Students who take an NYU language placement exam and demonstrate proficiency equivalent to completion of at least one course above the intermediate two level (i.e., they at least place into the second course above intermediate two) have also met this requirement. Anthropology core courses (three courses/12 points): Culture, Power, Society (ANTH-UA 1) Medical Anthropology (ANTH-UA 35) Global Biocultures (ANTH-UA 320) Anthropology elective courses (three courses/12 points), chosen from: Human Evolution (ANTH-UA 2) Language, Power and Identity (ANTH-UA 16) Conversations in Everyday Life (ANTH-UA 32) Human Variation (ANTH-UA 51) Evolutionary Medicine (ANTH-UA 55) Emerging Diseases (ANTH-UA 80) Anthropology of Gender and Sexuality (ANTH-UA 112) Disability Worlds (ANTH-UA 113) Race, Difference, and Social Inequality (ANTH-UA 323) Introduction to Forensic Anthropology (ANTH-UA 326) Global Public Health / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 270 Human Rights and Culture (ANTH-UA 331) The Social Life of Food: Producing, Selling, Cooking, Sharing, Eating (ANTH-UA 410) Major electives (two courses/8 points): Two additional electives must be completed in GPH or anthropology, by advisement. Global Public Health/Biology Students pursuing this combined program will complete courses to fulfill the global public health/ science major, with a concentration in biology that emphasizes one of the following areas: genetics and genomics, infectious diseases, or environmental health. The global public health/biology track provides a unique opportunity for students to explore cutting-edge life science and how recent advances can help address some of the world's most complex health challenges. Graduates are well prepared to pursue professional studies in medicine, dentistry, public health, and nutrition, as well as academic and research positions. The major in GPH/science with a concentration in biology requires twenty-two courses (94 points) completed with a grade of C or better, as follows: Five required 4-point UGPH-GU courses (20 points; UGPH-GU 10, 30, 40, 50, 60 as outlined above) Biostatistics (BIOL-UA 42), substituted for UGPH-GU 20 (4 points). This satisfies the College Core Curriculum requirement in Quantitative Reasoning. One foreign language course past the intermediate two level (4 points). This requirement is set by CAS, not by the College of Global Public Health (GPH). Students who present AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of at least one course above interme - diate two have satisfied the requirement. Students who take an NYU language placement exam and demonstrate proficiency equivalent to completion of at least one course above the interme - diate two level (i.e., they at least place into the second course above intermediate two) have also met this requirement. Biology core courses (four courses/16 points): Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12) NOTE: majors are not required to register for the 1-credit Principles of Biology Lab (BIOL-UA 123). Molecular and Cell Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 21, 22) NOTE: it is strongly recommended that students in this combined major also take the optional 1-credit Molecular and Cell Biology Lab (BIOL-UA 223) concurrently with MCB I (BIOL-UA 21).

A current list of courses approved as Global Public Health / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 271 electives is maintained on the official website of the Department of Biology. A second elective must be completed that either is one of these approved biology electives or is an elective approved by the GPH program. Global Public Health/Chemistry Students pursuing this combined program will complete courses to fulfill the global public health/ science major with a concentration in chemistry\u2014the central natural science that interfaces physics and mathematics with the life sciences. The major in GPH/science with a concentration in chemistry requires twenty-one courses (90 points) with a grade of C or better, as follows. As with all majors and minors offered by the Department of Chemistry, Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, 12) are not required for this major; however, prehealth students must take this sequence in addition to the 90 points outlined below. Careful planning is needed to make sure all major, prehealth, and College Core Curriculum requirements can be completed in four years. Six required 4-point UGPH-GU courses (24 points; as outlined above) One foreign language course past the intermediate two level (4 points). This requirement is set by CAS, not by the College of Global Public Health (GPH). Students who present AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of at least one course above intermediate two have satisfied the requirement. Students who take an NYU language place - ment exam and demonstrate proficiency equivalent to completion of at least one course above the intermediate two level (i.e., they at least place into the second course above intermediate two) have also met this requirement. Chemistry core courses (eight courses/36 points): General Chemistry and Laboratory I and II (CHEM-UA 125, 126).

Biochemistry I and II (CHEM-UA 881, 882) Additional required courses in science and math (four courses/18 points): Mathematics (two courses/8 points): Calculus I and II (MATH-UA 121,122). Advanced Placement credit for Calculus II (a score of 5 on BC Calculus) is not accepted for this major requirement. Students with this AP credit must either (1) take Calculus II at NYU and forfeit 4 of the 8 AP credits, or (2) register for one of the following: Mathematics of Chemistry (CHEM-UA 140). Calculus III (MATH-UA 123), or Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140), using the BC credits as prerequisite. Physics (two courses/10 points): General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11, 12). Credit for AP Physics C: Mechanics is accepted for PHYS-UA 12, but only for students who are not prehealth. No other AP or equivalent international credit is accepted. (Because of medical, dental, etc., school admissions requirements, students on the pre-health track cannot use AP Physics C credit to place out of either or both semesters of General Physics.) Major electives (two courses/8 points): Two additional electives must be completed in GPH and/or in chemistry. Global Public Health / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 272 Global Public Health/History The global public health/history major provides a unique opportunity to unite the study of human experience in relation to particular times and places with the study of the health of populations around the world.

Hebrew and Judaic Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22ALEXANDER S. ONASSIS PROGRAM in Hellenic Studies Director of the Program Clinical Professor Theodorato Director of Language Program Clinical Professor Theodoratouas.nyu.edu/hellenic 53 Washington Square South, Floor 3W New York, NY 10012-1018 212-998-3990Director of NYU in Athens Clinical Professor Theodoratou Hellenic Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 283 OVERVIEWThe Alexander S. Onassis Program in Hellenic Studies provides students with a comprehensive and interdisciplinary understanding of the language, literature, history, and politics of Greece. Through a wide range of courses, students are exposed to a polyphony of viewpoints that help elucidate the historical and political experiences of Byzantine, Ottoman, and modern Greece; the ways in which Greece has borne its several pasts and translated them into the modern era; Greece and its relations to Western Europe, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Mediterranean cultures; and the distinguished literary and artistic traditions of a country that many regard as the birthplace of Western civilization, even as these traditions exhibit their multicultural contexts. NYU's Arts and Science summer program in Athens combines classroom study of the language, history, and culture of Greece with extracurricular activities and excursions that introduce students to all aspects of Greek life. The program offers a wide range of courses on such subjects as the Greek language, Greek literature and photography, Greek drama, Greek political history, the city of Athens, and the archaeology of Greece. Classes are held at the new NYU facility in Athens, conveniently located in Kolonaki neighborhood and the historical center of Athens. Activities include walking tours of Athens, visits to monuments and museums, and evening outings to dramatic and musical performances. Weekend excursions include trips to several Greek islands and to important historical and archaeological sites. Relevant courses taken in this summer program count toward the major or minor as regular courses. n Major: General Information The major in Hellenic studies consists of ten 4-point courses (40 points) completed with a grade of C or better. Courses taken in NYU's Arts and Science summer program in Athens count toward the major as regular courses. A solid foundation in the modern Greek language is a requirement for all majors. Upon declaring the major, a student is expected to enroll in Elementary Modern Professors Fleming, Mitsis Associate Professor SmyrlisClinical Professor Theodoratou Greek I (HEL-UA 103) or take a placement examination. By the end of their program, all students must demonstrate competence in modern Greek at the intermediate level through successful completion of two semesters of Intermediate Modern Greek (HEL-UA 105, 106) or performance on a placement examination. Major: Programs of Study Qualified students may choose from three tracks within the major: Track A: Language, Literature, and Culture This track provides students with a solid foundation in the modern Greek language and provides a comprehensive introduction to medieval and modern Greek literature and culture. Track B: Politics and History This track provides students with an interdisciplinary social science perspective on the medieval and modern Greek experience. Students may choose to concentrate their studies in history or politics, or create their own combination in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Track C: The Classical Legacy This track provides students with an interdisciplinary perspective on the reception of classical Greek thought in postclassical Greece. Students in tracks A and B who have placed out of Intermediate Modern Greek I and II (HEL-UA 105, 106) are encouraged to take Advanced Modern Greek I and II (HEL-UA 107, 108). Track C students who place out of Intermediate Modern Greek are encouraged to take Advanced Modern Greek I and II (HEL-UA 107, 108), or two semesters of ancient Greek in the Department of Classics. All majors, regardless of their track, must complete: the Seminar on Modern Greek Culture (HEL-UA 130); and two specifically designated survey courses offered within the program. Which two survey courses they choose depends on the disciplinary track that they select. Every student must take at least one designated survey course in his or her own track of concentration and one designated survey course from another track. (Students in track A should also take a track B survey; students in track B should also take a track A survey; and students in track C should also take one survey in track A or B.) The following is a list of designated survey courses: Track A Memory, History, and Language in Modern Greek Poetry (HEL-UA 120) Narrative, History, and Fiction in the Modern Greek Novel (HEL-UA 190) Track B Modern Greek History (HEL-UA 159) History of the Byzantine Empire (HEL-UA 283) Modern Greek Politics (HEL-UA 525) Track C Memory, History, and Language in Modern Greek Poetry (HEL-UA 120) Greek Tragedy and Modern Greece (HEL-UA 320) Hellenic Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 285 Electives Additional Hellenic studies courses are required to reach the total of ten courses for the major. The exact number of electives varies according to a student's level of language proficiency upon entrance to the major. Subject to the approval of the director of undergraduate studies, cognate offerings in other departments or an approved internship may be counted toward the major. A sample list of cognate courses is available from the program office. Minor A minor in Hellenic studies requires four 4-point courses (16 points) offered by the program and competed with a grade of C or better. Students must show proficiency in modern Greek language by successful completion of either a placement examination or Intermediate Modern Greek II (HEL-UA 106). Elementary Modern Greek I and II do not count toward the minor. Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies of the program prior to registering for courses in the minor. If the minor includes any courses in Intermediate or Advanced Modern Greek, it cannot satisfy the Expressive Culture requirement of the College Core Curriculum. Honors Program A degree in Hellenic studies is awarded with honors to students who complete ten courses (40 points) of graded work while maintaining an overall GPA of 3.65 and an average in the major of 3.65, and who successfully complete a program of original research leading to an honors thesis. Honors students are required to enroll in both Independent Study (HEL-UA 997) and Senior Honors Seminar (HEL-UA 999). The thesis topic and the faculty adviser are chosen in consultation with the director of undergrad - uate studies. The average length of the paper is 40-60 pages. Honors students are encouraged, but not required, to take at least one appropriate graduate course in Hellenic studies. Prize The Rae Dalven Prize is a monetary prize awarded annually for the best term paper in the field of Hellenic studies. Submissions are not limited to Hellenic studies majors or minors.

Hellenic Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF History Chair of the Department Professor Sartorias.nyu.edu/history 53 Washington Square South, 4th Floor New York, NY 10012-1098 212-998-8600Director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Goetz History / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 288 OVERVIEWHistory is the study of human experience of all kinds, considered in relation to particular times and places. It is also a method of thinking characterized by its attention to the contexts in which people have lived and worked. By mastering this method of thinking, students of history gain invaluable skills and knowledge. They learn to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence (cultural, social, economic, and political) as well as to organize it into a coherent whole and present it clearly and with style in written or oral form. In doing so, students also learn to justify and question their own and others' conclusions, for history is always an argument about what actually happened. Indeed, rethinking and revising accepted historical conclusions is one of the most important\u2014and most interesting\u2014tasks of the historian. Notable among the department's areas of strength are American urban, social, labor, and ethnic history; medieval, early modern, and modern European history; Latin American history; sub- Saharan African history; early and modern Asian History; and American and European women's history. The department also pays particular attention to the transnational and global aspects of the discipline. At the core of the undergraduate experience are the workshop (HIST-UA 9XX) and the capstone seminar (HIST-UA 4XX). In the workshop, students learn about the methods and practice of history in a seminar setting. In the capstone seminar, usually taken in the senior year, students research and write an original paper (typically 20-25 pages). Through independent study and the honors program, students find challenging opportunities for special concentrations and individual research. The internship program enables students to engage in supervised historical projects for credit. Many of the projects are at cultural institutions in New York and at the United Nations. The University's Elmer Holmes Bobst Library is rich in works of history, and students also utilize the collections of the New York Public Library, the historical societies and museums in New York City, and neighboring universities. n Professors Emeriti Baker, Bender, Bonomi, Harootunian, Hull, P .

All majors must take one workshop (HIST-UA 900-999; excluding 994, 996, 980, and 997). Students must also take one capstone seminar (HIST-UA 400-499; prerequisite: workshop). At least 20 points in total must be in advanced level history courses (HIST-UA 100 or above). This includes the workshop and capstone seminar requirements. No student may take more than 16 points in introductory courses (numbered below HIST-UA 100). At least 4 points must be taken in each of the three geographical areas: U.S., European, and non-Western. These courses may be either introductory or advanced. At least 8 points must be taken in pre-1800 courses. One course can count toward no more than two geographical or temporal requirements. Policies Applying to the Major in History No Pass/Fail courses can count toward the major. Students may count four points (the equivalent of one course) from Advanced Placement, In - ternational Baccalaureate, or Advanced (A) Level examinations toward the requirements of the major. Four points from other advanced standing examinations may be accepted after consulta - tion with the department. These credits are not equivalent to specific courses in the major (they are HIST-UA elective credit) and count as one introductory course. If AP/IB/A-Level credit is used toward the major, then only three other non-history or non-NYU (transfer) courses (12 points) can be petitioned toward the major (including Liberal Studies courses). A transfer student must take at least 20 points in the department. A total of 16 transfer points can be approved through the course petition process to be counted toward the major, inclusive of any AP/IB/A-Level credits. Approval of course credit is not guaranteed. Courses that are not cross-listed with the history department must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Students can petition for up to four courses (16 points) to count towards History / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 290 their major by turning in a course petition form with the syllabus to the Department of History. No course is guaranteed. Certain courses in the College Core Curriculum may also count toward the history major as introductory courses. These are Texts and Ideas and Cultures and Contexts, if they are taught by faculty from the Department of History. Also, majoring in history exempts students from taking the Societies and the Social Sciences component of the Core Curriculum. Global Public Health/History Major The global public health/history major provides a unique opportunity to unite the study of human experience in relation to particular times and places with the study of health of populations around the world. The major draws on the expertise of the CAS Department of History in providing students with the tools needed to analyze and interpret many different kinds of evidence\u2014cultural, social, economic, and political\u2014and to organize them into a coherent whole, presented clearly in written or oral form. Students will study a variety of topics, such as environmental history, ethnicity, sexuality, epidemiology, health policy, gender, and social movements. NYU's global public health/history major provides a unique set of skills that may be applied in a variety of careers including law, teaching, public health, business, film, international affairs, and medicine and science. This major requires fifteen 4-point courses (60 points) with a grade of C or better, as follows. Global public health requirements (six courses/24 points): Health and Society in a Global Context (UGPH-GU 10) Biostatistics for Public Health (UGPH-GU 20). (T his satisfies the College Core Curriculum requirement in Quantitative Reasoning .) Epidemiology for Global Health (UGPH-GU 30) Health Policy in a Global World (UGPH-GU 40) Environmental Health in a Global World (UGPH-GU 50) GPH Internship (UGPH-GU 60) One semester of advanced foreign language (above intermediate II level). Students who present AP or other advanced standing credit that is equivalent to completion of at least one course above intermediate two have satisfied the requirement. Students who take an NYU language placement exam and demonstrate proficiency equivalent to completion of at least one course above the intermediate two level (i.e., they at least place into the second course above interme - diate two) have also met this requirement. One semester of study away is also required. History requirements (two courses/8 points): One workshop (HIST-UA 900-999; excluding 994, 996, 980 and 997) One capstone seminar (HIST-UA 400-499) History electives (four courses/16 points): Four courses numbered above HIST-UA 101. Students must take at least one pre-1800 course and at least one course in each of these three regions: U.S., non-Western, and European. All must be advanced. Major electives: Two courses (8 points) chosen from history and/or GPH. For descriptions of GPH (UGPH-GU) courses and for all policies applying to the major (including those for transfer students), please see the global public health section of this Bulletin. History / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 291 Minor in History The minor in history requires a minimum of 16 points in any combination of 2- and 4-point courses, with a grade of C or better in each course. Twelve of the points must be taken in the Department of History. Pass/Fail courses do not count. No more than 4 points may be taken in introductory- level courses. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and other advanced standing credit does not count toward the minor. Note: Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies for possible minor programs, course offerings, and course descriptions. A complete listing of history courses currently offered may be found in the current class schedule available on the department website. Honors Program Students with strong academic records (a GPA of 3.65 in history and 3.65 overall) may apply to the director of undergraduate studies for admission to the history honors program. Students must be declared history majors or have already taken the workshop (HIST-UA 9XX) to apply for the two-course, 8-point program. The honors program is completed in two consecutive semesters and consists of a small Honors Seminar (HIST-UA 994) followed by an individualized Honors Tutorial (HIST-UA 996). In the Honors Seminar (which satisfies the capstone seminar requirement for the major) students define a thesis topic, develop a bibliography, read broadly, and begin their research. A substantial part of the research, usually including a rough draft of the thesis, should be completed by the semester's end. In the Honors Tutorial, students work one-on-one with a faculty director to complete the thesis. The honors thesis varies in length from 40 to 70 pages, depending on the nature and scope of the subject. The completed thesis, approved for defense by the director, is defended before a committee consisting of a primary faculty advisor and at least one additional faculty reader. A grade of at least A-minus on the thesis is required for the award of honors in history. Students who receive a lower passing grade are simply awarded 8 points toward the major. Study Away The department encourages history majors and minors to study away during the fall or spring semester of their junior year. Studying away at one of New York University's many global academic centers can help open doors to the discovery of unexpected areas of interest, as well as provide new insight about already established historical perspectives and research topics. Some courses offered by NYU for study away, as well as other approved programs outside NYU, may be eligible for inclusion into the history major. History majors should consult the director of undergraduate studies before making plans to study away.

History / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22MAJOR IN International Relations Director Professor Gilliganas.nyu.edu/politics 19 West Fourth Street, 2nd Floor New York, NY 10012 212-998-8500 International Relations / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 303 OVERVIEWInternational relations (IR), offered through the Wilf Family Department of Politics, seeks to provide students with an understanding of the global system's past, the tools to function effec - tively in the present, and the ability to respond to future developments. The program recognizes the changing nature of the contemporary political and economic environment and seeks to lay an interdisciplinary basis for understanding these changes. It provides students with an opportu - nity to study the complex web of transnational politics in an in-depth, interdisciplinary fashion. The breadth of courses is designed to match the breadth of knowledge and skills that the field requires. The program combines a foundation of core courses in politics, economics, and statistics with a suite of classes on international relations and political economy, elective courses focused on a particular region, advanced study in a foreign language, and a required semester of study abroad. An honors program is offered for qualified students, who take an additional two-semes - ter seminar sequence in their senior year in which they write a thesis under close supervision of faculty members. n Eligibility to Declare the Major To be eligible to declare the major, students must first complete International Politics (POL-UA 700). They must also first complete either Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) or Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), or present equivalent Advanced Placement or other advanced standing credit in economics. Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and A Level Credits Students who have advanced standing credits for macroeconomics and/or microeconomics may count them toward the IR major's requirements of Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) and Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2). However, statistics credit from AP, IB, or A Levels does not satisfy the IR major's research methodology requirement.Professors Brams, Rosendorff, SatyanathFACULTY PROGRAM 304 Major: General Information All majors must complete a total of twelve 4-point courses (48 points). They complete four core courses, four courses in the international relations environment, and two courses in a regional specialization.

Whether taken at Washington Square or away, both courses must be approved in advance by the program director or the undergraduate advisor for IR. We do not accept courses in art, art history, literature, or film for this requirement. Foreign Language Requirement Students satisfy this requirement by completing two courses (8 points) beyond the intermediate level. It is recommended but not required that the language be related to the regional specialization and/or the study away site. If a student considers himself or herself fluent in a foreign language, he or she can 1) complete the requirement with a third language or 2) take two advanced courses (literature or advanced translation) in the foreign language of the student's fluency. In either case, the student must take two courses past the intermediate level; we do not waive this requirement for the IR major.

Graduate courses require the permission of the director of graduate studies. Students declare the minor by turning in the declaration form to the director of undergraduate studies. Note that the minor must consist exclusively of content courses (i.e., must not contain a course in Irish language) in order to satisfy the Expressive Culture component of the College Core Curriculum. Arts and Science Summer in Dublin NYU in Dublin offers students the opportunity to live and study in a capital city that combines the modernity of a thriving European city with a rich heritage spanning more than a millennium. The program and student housing are centered at Trinity College, Ireland's oldest university. This program is an intensive study of modern Irish society and culture with particular emphasis on history, literature, creative writing, and the Irish language. Students examine the experiences and problems that have played a pivotal role in the 20th century and beyond, including the contem - porary cultural renaissance, the Celtic Tiger economy, and the revival of the native language. A series of field trips, including weekend excursions to the west of Ireland, complement the academic course of study. B.A./M.A. Program NYU undergraduates with a 3.5 GPA may apply, in their junior year, to be accepted as B.A./M.A. candidates in the Irish and Irish American studies M.A. program. This allows students to complete both a B.A. in an undergraduate major in the College of Arts and Science and the M.A. degree in five years. A tuition discount may apply.

Honors Program in Italian Studies To qualify for honors in the Italian studies major, a student must maintain an overall GPA of 3.65 and a major GPA of 3.65 or higher. Students who wish to pursue honors should contact the director of undergraduate studies for an application during the junior year. The director of undergraduate studies may, by petition to the director of college honors, consider strong candidates who do not meet the GPA threshold of 3.65. Honors majors complete an 8-point sequence consisting of the Senior Honors Seminar (ITAL-UA 999), taken in the fall of senior year, and the Honors Independent Study (ITAL-UA 990), taken in the spring of senior year. Both count as advanced courses for the major. Students work closely with a departmental faculty member who becomes the honors thesis adviser (chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies). The thesis should be a work of scholarship and/or criticism from 40 to 60 pages in length. In consultation with a second faculty reader, the student's thesis adviser determines whether or not to recommend him or her for honors in Italian. A grade of at least A-minus is required for the award of honors. Students receiving a lower grade will simply be awarded 8 credits toward the major. Capstone Project Option for Non-Honors Majors Majors in the department who do not choose or qualify to write a senior honors thesis may pursue the capstone project option, which is not a requirement for the major. Developed in conjunction with a faculty member in the junior or senior year, the capstone consists of a research paper or research project, as well as a final oral defense/discussion of the project in Italian. The capstone does not require a separate course or independent study, but rather is developed within a class in which the student is already enrolled. The project is completed in addition to the existing course requirements (whether a final paper written in the Italian language, extra pages added to a research paper, a creative project such as a film or film script, etc.). The department's spring undergraduate conference offers an ideal venue for the presentation of outstanding capstone projects. Accelerated B.A/M.A. Program in Italian Studies Undergraduates with a cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher are eligible for the five-year program in Italian Studies. For full-time students in CAS, tuition for the fifth year is offered at a 50 percent discount, and the application fee and GRE exam are waived.

Carter Journalism Institute Director of the Institute Professor Conover Associate Director of the Institute Associate Professor Bazzijournalism.nyu.edu 20 Cooper Square, 6th Floor New York, NY 10003-6636 212-998-7980Director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Penenberg Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 322 OVERVIEWAt NYU, we believe that journalism has a critical public mission and can make a difference in a free and democratic society. Opportunities abound in the media world, but the opportunity to do compelling work that informs, engages, and matters is what drives our faculty, motivates our students, and shapes our basic approach. Our coursework focuses on the basic skills of reporting, research, writing, and multimedia storycan and should accomplish when informing the public. New York City is our laboratory, and students move seamlessly from the classroom into the city on assignments that take them all over town. Given our place within the Arts and Science core of a leading university, the institute sees journalism as an essential strand in the liberal arts tradition. But we also recognize that news is a business. When our graduates enter that business, they are prepared to improve and enliven it. And even if they do not pursue careers in journalism, the training our students receive\u2014the ability to read closely, engage in deep research, think critically, and write effectively\u2014are essential for success in any career. n PROGRAM Major in Journalism: General Information The institute offers two concentrations, in journalism and media criticism. The concentration in media criticism is open only to students who declared it on or before May 19, 2020 (the end of the spring 2020 term). Professor Emeritus Burrows Marjorie Deane Professor of Financial Journalism SchellmannClinical Professors Edozien, Latty, Quigley Clinical Associate Professor Maloney Distinguished Writers In Residence Coates, Griswold, Hamill, Hotz, McBride, Oransky, RushdieFACULTY 323 In both concentrations, the major consists of eight 4-point courses for a total of 32 points. Students are also required to complete a second major in the College of Arts and Science. Thus, all journalism majors are double majors. Students pursuing the honors program take one additional course, completing nine 4-point courses for a total of 36 points. Students may choose to take up to 36 points in journalism (but no more); the only exception is for honors majors, who may take up to 40 points (but no more). Journalism Concentration The journalism concentration is designed to provide students with general training in written and multimedia forms of journalism, as well as well as more in-depth training in a \"track\" or special - ization of their choice, either print/online journalism or broadcast journalism. Details about these tracks appear below. All majors following this concentration are required to take the following five core courses: Investigating Journalism: Ethics and Practice (JOUR-UA 50) Journalistic Inquiry: The Written Word (JOUR-UA 101) Journalistic Inquiry: Multimedia (JOUR-UA 102) The Beat (JOUR-UA 201) Advanced Reporting (JOUR-UA 301), or the honors sequence of Advanced Reporting (JOUR-UA 351) and the Senior Seminar (JOUR-UA 352) Although students are generally encouraged to complete the core courses in sequence, some courses can be completed out of sequence and/or concurrently. Students may consult the undergraduate studies section of the journalism website for details about course prerequisites and sequencing. Tracks: Before completing the last two core courses in the major (The Beat and Advanced Reporting), journalism majors specialize by pursuing one of two tracks: The print/online track is designed for students who wish to focus on writing and reporting for print and online media. The broadcast track is for students who wish to focus on reporting and video production for broadcast media. While students are not required to formally declare their track (and it will not be specified in Albert or on their diploma or transcript), they will need to choose which track they want to pursue before taking The Beat and Advanced Reporting and must commit to that track. Students cannot \"mix-and-match\" Beat and Advanced reporting sections from different tracks (i.e. they cannot take a broadcast section of Advanced Reporting after taking a print/online section of The Beat). In addition to the five required core courses outlined above, students also take three electives, chosen from the following: Methods and Practice (JOUR-UA 202) Methods and Practice: Visual Reporting (JOUR-UA 203) Elective Reporting Topics (JOUR-UA 204) Production and Publication (JOUR-UA 302) Seminar (JOUR-UA 401) Journalism Ethics and First Amendment Law (JOUR-UA 502) Journalism and Society (JOUR-UA 503) Journalism as Literature (JOUR-UA 504) Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 324 Issues and Ideas (JOUR-UA 505) Independent Study (JOUR-UA 997) Certain electives from other departments and programs can, with permission, be approved as electives for the journalism concentration. Because the institute puts a high value on numeric literacy, double majors in economics, politics, psychology, and sociology may count any of the following quantitative courses toward their three required electives: Economics: Statistics (ECON-UA 18) Politics: Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) or Introduction to Research Methods for Politics (POL-UA 850) Psychology: Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) Sociology: Statistics for Social Research (SOC-UA 302) Media Criticism Concentration The concentration in media criticism is open only to students who declared it on or before May 19, 2020 (the end of the spring 2020 term). Students in the media criticism concentration must complete six required courses (two lecture courses and four skills courses), one seminar, and one elective from a specified list of journalism offerings. All majors following this concentration must take these two required lectures: Investigating Journalism: Ethics and Practice (JOUR-UA 50) Media Past and Future (JOUR-UA 610), or an approved substitute course Plus four required skills courses: Journalistic Inquiry: The Written Word (JOUR-UA 101) Journalistic Inquiry: Multimedia (JOUR-UA 102) The Beat (JOUR-UA 201) Advanced Reporting (JOUR-UA 301) Plus two additional courses: One seminar, which may be selected from any journalism seminar or Journalism Ethics and First Amendment Law (JOUR-UA 502) One elective course from a specified list of journalism offerings Policies Applying to Both Major Concentrations Completion of either journalism major concentration exempts students from the College Core Curriculum's course Societies and the Social Sciences. The prerequisite for both Investigating Journalism: Ethics and Practice (JOUR-UA 50) and Jour - nalistic Inquiry: The Written Word (JOUR-UA 101) is completion of the College's expository writing requirement. Please see course descriptions for more detail on prerequisites and sequencing. Students must achieve a grade of C (not C-minus) or better in all journalism courses to meet prerequisite requirements and count them toward the major. (Pass/Fail grades do not count.) Students earning grades lower than C must either repeat the course, or take an equivalent course if permitted. All majors must complete a capstone piece in the required skills course Advanced Reporting, which allows for assessment of their progress at the conclusion of the major. Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 325 Policy on 2-Point Courses Journalism majors may take two (and no more than two) 2-point JOUR-UA courses in lieu of one 4-point course toward the elective requirement for the major (which is the completion of three electives/12 points in total). Petitions to substitute 2-point courses from outside the journalism department will not be considered. Journalism minors must fulfill their elective requirement by completing 4-point electives. Minor in Print and Online Journalism This minor consists of five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a C or better (Pass/Fail grades do not count): Journalistic Inquiry: The Written Word (JOUR-UA 101) The Beat print/online section only; JOUR-UA 201) Three 4-point JOUR-UA electives Minor in Broadcast and Multimedia Journalism This minor consists of five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a C or better (Pass/Fail grades do not count): Journalistic Inquiry: The Written Word (JOUR-UA 101) Journalistic Inquiry: Multimedia (JOUR-UA 102) The Beat (dedicated broadcast section only; JOUR-UA 201) Two 4-point JOUR-UA electives Policies Applying to Both Minors A completed major in journalism exempts students from the College Core Curriculum's Societies and the Social Sciences requirement, but completion of either minor does not serve as an exemption from this Core requirement. Honors Program Juniors and seniors who have maintained a 3.65 overall GPA and a 3.65 GPA in the journalism major are eligible for the two-course, 8-point honors program. Students take a special honors section of Advanced Reporting (JOUR-UA 351) followed by the Honors Senior Seminar (JOUR-UA 352) to complete a two-semester capstone project. Students enrolled in honors may take a maximum of 40 credits in journalism. Arthur L.

The College of Arts and Science boasts a distinguished, dynamic faculty in Latin American and Caribbean studies, with leading scholars of the Caribbean, Central America, the Andes, Latino/a studies, and beyond working in areas as diverse as post-conflict human rights debates, Caribbean literature, comparative race and racism, the hemispheric impact of neoliberalism, biopolitics and gender, and visual and performance cultures. Students are introduced to Latin America and the Caribbean as both a foreign and a local culture; the program encourages them to study away at NYU Buenos Aires, where a range of courses has been developed for majors and minors, and equally encourages them to experience New York City as an eminently Latino metropolis. NYU also boasts rare and innovative programs in the study of Haitian Kreyol and of Quechua; students may use either to fulfill their Core language requirement. Students benefit from the ample programming and resources of NYU's Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies (CLACS, as.nyu.edu/clacs ) and the vast resources related to Latin America and the Caribbean in the city, including the Americas Society, the Hispanic Society of America, and the Museo del Barrio. The undergraduate major and minor are offered jointly by the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures and the Center for Latin American and Carib - bean Studies. They are administered by the Department of Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures. n Major This interdisciplinary major requires nine courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better.

These language courses (and any more advanced language electives) cannot be applied toward the nine courses required for this major. Minor This interdisciplinary minor requires five courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better. It offers students the opportunity to incorporate an interest in Latin America and the Caribbean into their overall course of study. Courses are drawn from the Department of Spanish and Portu - guese and/or other departments across the university.

Latin American and Caribbean Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22MAJOR/MINOR IN Latino Studies Director of Latino Studies Professor D\u00e1vila as.nyu.edu/latinostudies 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor New York, NY 10003-7112 212-992-9650 Latino Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 335 OVERVIEW PROGRAMHoused in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), Latino studies aims to produce knowledge about people of Latin American descent living in the United States and to integrate this knowledge into the country's understanding of itself. Latino is a concept grounded in the United States, and Latino studies, in this respect, is clearly distinct from Latin American studies. The program examines such topics as the dynamics of race, class, nationality, generation, language, gender, and sexuality among different Latino subgroups; Pan-Latino/a visions; comparative interethnic dynamics, particularly relations among Latinos, African Americans, and Asian Americans; transnational linkages and communities, migratory circuits, and transcultural processes; and interactions between U.S. groups and \"home\" populations. NYU's Latino studies program has a distinctive profile that gives it intellectual weight. Its location in New York City makes possible a program built around synergy among the arts, social sciences, and humanities. It offers students training in both field-based and archival research, including opportunities abroad. And finally, it promotes the study of bilingualism, of the politics of language, and of cultural texts, and offers courses designed to develop bilingual research abilities. Existing resources in Spanish and Portuguese support this aim, and the city is a valuable laboratory for research on languages in contact. n Major The Latino studies major requires nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better. Two introductory courses - may be taken in either order: Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101) Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (CORE-UA 529; offered every fall) Six elective courses: Six designated Latino studies electives, of which four must be taught by SCA faculty. SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program (SCA-UA 42) is no longer required but is highly recommended and can count as an elective.Professors Emeriti Pratt, Rosaldo Professors D\u00e1vila, Salda\u00f1a Associate Professors Beltr\u00e1n, RalphFACULTY 336 One research course: Advanced Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90) Minor Five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better are required for the minor in Latino studies. Students must take Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (CORE-UA 529; offered every fall). They also take four designated Latino studies electives, of which two must be taught by SCA faculty. Language and Linguistic Competency The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within and across different social groups. Latino studies therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in Spanish, Portuguese, and/or any indigenous languages spoken in the Americas by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying these languages beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. Policy on Double Counting of Courses Majors may share (double count) two courses with a second major, with permission from the other department/program. Minors may share (double count) one course with a major or a second minor, with permission from the other department/program. Honors Program Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year. Upon successful completion of the seminar requirement, students will be eligible to register for Senior Honors Thesis (SCA-UA 93) in the spring.

Latino Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22PROGRAM IN Law and Society Director Professor Haneyas.nyu.edu/sociology 295 Lafayette Street, 4th Floor New York, NY 10012 212-998-8340 Law and Society / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 340 OVERVIEWMany of the liberal arts disciplines in the College of Arts and Science provide important perspec - tives on law and the legal profession. The law and society minor, administered by the Department of Sociology, offers undergraduates a meaningful concentration of these courses. The minor is designed to give students an interdisciplinary perspective on law as a social institution and on how law shapes, and is shaped by, a variety of political, religious, cultural, economic, and social forces. The minor in law and society consists of five courses, which allows it to be substantial and broad. The requirement of a core course enhances its coherence. In addition, the minor gives capable and ambitious students opportunities to pursue advanced or specialized study. While prelaw students may well wish to take it, this minor is not aimed specifically at them. Students wishing to declare this minor should speak with the academic administrator for the Department of Sociology, 295 Lafayette Street, Room 4168; 212-998-8340. n PROGRAM Minor The minor in law and society consists of five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better (courses graded Pass/Fail do not count). The requirements are as follows: One core course, chosen from: Law and Society (LWSOC-UA 1, section 001), cross-listed with politics (POL-UA 335) Law and Society (LWSOC-UA 1, section 002), cross-listed with sociology (SOC-UA 413) One course in Research Methods (SOC-UA 301), or another methods course (with approval of law and society director) Three elective courses (see under course offerings for a list of approved electives). Students may petition the director to have other courses count toward the elective requirement.Professors Anderson (Anthropology) Benton (History) Bruner (Psychology; Law) Garland (Sociology; Law) Gordon (History) Greenberg (Sociology) Haney (Sociology; Director, Law and Society) Harrington (Politics) Harvey (Politics) Jost (Psychology)Lukes (Sociology) Merry (Anthropology) Peachin (Classics) Persico (Economics) Schieffelin (Anthropology)Associate Professors Fahmy (Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies) Rizzo (Economics) Solomon (Journalism)FACULTY 341 Students majoring in sociology must take Research Methods (SOC-UA 301) for their major; they must therefore take a fourth elective for the law and society minor.

It seeks to determine that which is necessary in human language, that which is possible, and that which is impossible. While linguists work to determine the unique qualities of individual languages, they are constantly searching for linguistic universals\u2014 properties whose explanatory power reaches across languages. The discipline of linguistics is organized around syntax (the principles by which sentences are organized), morphol - ogy (the principles by which words are constructed), semantics (the study of meaning), phonetics (the study of speech sounds), phonology (the sound patterns of language), historical linguistics (the ways in which languages change over time), sociolinguistics (the interaction of language with society), psycholinguistics, and neurolinguistics (the representation of language in the brain). Current research by faculty members extends across the field, including topics in the interaction of syntax and semantics, phonetics and phonology, languages in contact, pidgin and creole languages, urban sociolinguistics, and computer analogies of syntactic processes. n Major in Linguistics The major consists of nine 4-point courses (36 points) as follows: Either Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 3) Sound and (LING-UA 11)Professors Emeriti Kayne Silver Professor; Professor of Linguistics and Psychology Marantz Professors Barker, Collins, Davidson, Gouskova, Guy, Pylkk\u00e4nen, SzabolcsiAssociate Professors Blake, Champollion, Gallagher Assistant Professors Bowman, Cournane, MacKenzie, Stanton, Thoms Clinical Associate Professor Harves Global Distinguished Professor SchlenkerAffiliated Faculty Almeida (Psychology, NYUAD) Arunachalam (Communicative Sciences and Disorders) Buchwald (Communicative Sciences and Disorders) Das (Anthropology) Fine (Philosophy) Grishman (Computer Science) Levi (Communicative Sciences and Disorders) McAllister Byun (Communica - tive Disorders)McElree (Psychology) Poeppel Schieffelin (Anthropology) Schiffer (Philosophy)FACULTY PROGRAM 344 Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12) One of the following: Language and Society (LING-UA 15); African American Vernacular English (LING-UA 23); Language in America (LING-UA 30); Pidgin and Creole Languages (LING-UA 38); or English Dialects (LING-UA 57) Three courses freely chosen from the offerings of the department (major electives). With permission, students may choose from Introduction to Audiology (CSCD-UE 221), Anatomy and Physiology (CSCD-UE 231), and/or Neuroanatomy and Physiology (CSCD-UE 241) and count them toward the major as electives. These courses are offered by the Depart - ment of Communicative Sciences and Disorders in the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, but do not count against CAS students' allowance of 16 points taken outside of the College in the other schools of NYU. Majors and joint majors should begin with the first three requirements above, since other courses have these as prerequisites or presuppose their content. Note that Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) is only taught in the fall; it is a prerequisite for Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12). No grade lower than C (or any course taken Pass/Fail) may be counted toward the major or toward a joint major. In some cases, courses taken for a major in the Department of Linguistics may be applied to the requirements of another major or minor if the departments consider this appropriate. Students must then obtain written approval for the shared course(s) from the directors of undergraduate studies of both departments. No student may double count more than two courses between two majors (or between a major and a minor, or between two minors). All linguistics majors, joint majors, and combined majors must select and register for linguistics courses with the advice of the director of undergraduate studies in the linguistics department. Joint Majors with a Foreign Language The Department of Linguistics offers joint majors with the Departments of French, German, Italian, and Spanish and Portuguese. The major with Spanish requires a total of ten 4-point courses (40 points); the majors with the other languages require a total of nine 4-point courses (36 points). All courses must be completed with a grade of C or better. The linguistics portion of the joint foreign language majors is always satisfied by taking the following five courses (20 points): Either Language (LING-UA 1) or Language and Mind (LING-UA 3) Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) A total of two additional courses from two different fields of linguistics, chosen from the following: Historical linguistics (LING-UA 14) Sociolinguistics (LING-UA LING-UA 43, LING-UA 54, LING-UA 59) Structure of a modern language (LING-UA 10, LING-UA 42, LING-UA 44, LING-UA 9032) French requires four additional 4-point courses (16 points) as follows: One advanced language course chosen from: Linguistics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 345 Spoken Contemporary French (FREN-UA 101) Phonetics (FREN-UA 103) Translation (FREN-UA 107) Advanced Techniques of Translation (FREN-UA 108) Acting French (FREN-UA 109) Business French (FREN-UA 110) One course in advanced written French (usually Written Contemporary French, FREN-UA 105) Two courses in French literature, in French, to be determined in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies in the French department.

Note that neither course counts toward the major. Students take five advanced Spanish courses, chosen with the advice of this department's director of undergraduate studies. One of the five may be an advanced language elective (creative writing, conversation, or translation). Joint Major in Anthropology and Linguistics This joint major emphasizes the complementary nature of anthropological and sociolinguistic approaches to language. Students are required to take 20 points (five 4-point courses) each from the Department of Anthropology and the Department of Linguistics, for ten courses (40 points) total.

Ten courses (40 points) are required (four in linguistics, one in philosophy, four in psychology, and one additional course). All must be completed with a grade of C or better. The linguistics component consists of these four courses: Language and Mind (LING-UA 3) or Language (LING-UA 1) Two courses chosen from the following: Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12) Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) One course, chosen from the following: Introduction to Semantics (LING-UA 4) Psycholinguistics (LING-UA 5) Patterns in Language (LING-UA 6) Formal Languages (LING-UA 7) Sound and Language (LING-UA 11) Phonological Analysis (LING-UA 12) Grammatical Analysis (LING-UA 13) Advanced Semantics (LING-UA 19) Propositional Attitudes (LING-UA 35) The Syntax/Semantics Interface Cross-linguistically 37) Neural Bases of Language (LING-UA 43 or PSYCH-UA 300) Linguistics as Cognitive Science (LING-UA 48) Learning to Speak (LING-UA 54) Introduction to Morphology at an Advanced Level (LING-UA 55) Linguistics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 347 First Language Acquisition (LING-UA 59 or PSYCH-UA 300) The philosophy component is a choice of one of the following three courses: Minds and Machines (PHIL-UA 5) Logic (PHIL-UA 70) Philosophy of Language (PHIL-UA 85) The psychology component consists of four courses: Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) Cognition (PSYCH-UA 29) One course chosen from among the following: Introduction to Psycholinguistics (PSYCH-UA 56) Language Acquisition and Cognitive Development (PSYCH-UA 300) Neural Bases of Language (PSYCH-UA 300) Speech: A Window into the Developing Mind (PSYCH-UA 300) One course chosen from among the following: Perception (PSYCH-UA 22) Cognitive Neuroscience (PSYCH-UA 25) Laboratory in Cognition and Perception (PSYCH-UA 46) Introduction to Psycholinguistics (PSYCH-UA 56) Language Acquisition and Cognitive Development (PSYCH-UA 300) Neural Bases of Language (PSYCH-UA 300) Speech: A Window into the Developing Mind (PSYCH-UA 300) The tenth course will be an additional course from the lists above that has not already been taken to satisfy the departmental components. Joint majors should consult with the respective directors of undergraduate studies of the participating departments. Minor in Linguistics Four courses (16 points) in linguistics with a grade of C or better in each course. Courses taken Pass/Fail do not count. If any course is used to fulfill the major or minor requirements in any other department or program at NYU, it may not be used simultaneously to fulfill the requirements for the linguistics minor. Recommended Work outside the Department To meet standards currently set in the linguistics field, as well as graduate school admission requirements, students majoring in linguistics are advised to gain competence in the following areas during their undergraduate studies: (1) one or more foreign languages, (2) psychology, for issues of language and the mind, and anthropology, for issues of language and culture, (3) mathematics or logic, for an understanding of modern algebra and mathematical logic, (4) philosophy of language, and (5) one or more computer languages. Majors and minors should avail themselves of the NYU study away programs. Note that any course substitution or transfer credit toward a required course for the major must be confirmed by a letter from the director of undergraduate studies. Honors in Linguistics The Department of Linguistics offers an honors track. The requirement for graduation with honors in linguistics is an honors thesis of 40 to 50 pages, typically the culmination of a year's work, and Linguistics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 348 two advanced courses chosen with the honors thesis adviser. Students who are excelling in the linguistics major are highly encouraged to develop an honors project as early as the second semester of their sophomore year. It is expected that students who pursue honors work in the Department of Linguistics have sufficient preparation and background (i.e., high-level coursework) in a field of linguistics, which is not always the case for students in the joint majors with French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Admission to the honors program is by application in the second semester of junior year. To be eligible, a student must have a GPA of 3.65 overall as well as in linguistics. Applications are due to the director of undergraduate studies by April 15 and must include a one- to two-page description of the topic that the student wishes to investigate in the senior thesis. The student must identify a faculty member in the Department of Linguistics who has agreed to supervise the project, and the description of the thesis is written in consultation with this faculty adviser. Joint Honors The Department of Linguistics offers joint honors in all programs for which it offers joint majors: language and mind, anthropology and linguistics, French and linguistics, German and linguistics, Italian and linguistics, and Spanish and linguistics. For the requirements of joint honors in anthropology and linguistics, students should see Professor Ren\u00e9e Blake. For the requirements of joint honors in language and mind, students should follow the same procedure for honors in linguistics, except that their proposal should identify faculty members from two departments in the language and mind major (linguistics, philosophy, and psychology) who will be co-advisers. The thesis topic must reflect contributions to both disciplines. Students interested in pursuing joint honors in linguistics and French, German, Italian, or Spanish should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in linguistics, as well as in the language department, in or before the second semester of their junior year.

DEPARTMENT OF Mathematics Director, Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences Professor Caflisch Chair of the Department Professor Kleinermath.nyu.edu 251 Mercer Street New York, NY 10012-1110 212-998-3005Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Germain Vice-Chair for Undergraduate Affairs Professor Leingang Mathematics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 355 OVERVIEWThe undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a wide variety of courses in both pure and applied mathematics. Faculty are members of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, which has become a leading research center through its tradition of integrating mathe - matical theory and applications. In addition to the mathematics major, joint programs are available in mathematics and (1) computer science, (2) economics, and (3) engineering. These majors lead to the B.A. degree in four years, with the exception of the engineering option, which leads to the B.S. degree from the College of Arts and Science and the B.S. degree from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering in five years. An accelerated, five-year B.A. and M.S. mathematics program is offered with the Graduate School of Arts and Science, as well as an M.A. in mathematics education program with Steinhardt. The department also provides honors programs in (1) mathematics, (2) mathematics and computer science, and (3) economics and mathematics for outstanding students. In addition, independent study courses are available for students with special interests. Mathematics majors are encouraged to spend a semester studying away. Currently, mathematics courses are offered at NYU Abu Dhabi, NYU Berlin, NYU London, NYU Paris, and NYU Shanghai. n Professors Emeriti Berman, Childress, Professors of Mathematics Gromov, Srinivasa Silver Professors; Professors of Mathematics Berger, Bogomolov, Francfort Visiting Assistant Professors Buonerba, Hirschberg, Pang Global Distinguished Professors Das, Giuliani, Hartung, FACULTY 356 Huang, Kim, Leal, Leble, Li, Ling, Malhotra, Shapley, Sidoravicius, Simoncelli, Sodickson, Sokal, Tuckerman PROGRAM CAS Mathematics Requirement (Quantitative Reasoning) To satisfy the College Core Curriculum requirement in Quantitative Reasoning (QR), all College of Arts and Science students must either take one semester of an approved course with mathematical content, or present qualifying advanced standing credit or SAT Subject Examination scores to exempt from the requirement. (There is no CAS examination to exempt students from QR.) Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB; HL only), and Advanced Level (A Level; not AS) credit in calculus, statistics, and mathematics satisfies the QR requirement, as does similar credit in selected international examinations. Consult the admission section of this Bulletin or a CAS adviser for details on which approved examinations and minimum scores confer credit. In addition, a score of 700 or higher on the SAT Subject Examination in Mathematics (either level 1 or 2) satisfies the Core QR requirement (no credit is awarded). Students in the following majors or tracks of study are required to take courses which also satisfy the Core QR requirement: computer science, data science, economics, engineering, global public health, international relations, mathematics, the natural sciences, the prehealth track, psychology, and sociology. (These areas of study differ in whether and how they accept advanced standing credit toward their quantitative requirements; consult the appropriate sections of this Bulletin.) CAS students who are not pursuing one of these courses of study, and who cannot present ad - vanced standing credit or SAT Subject Examination scores for exemption from the QR requirement, must take one of the Quantitative Reasoning (CORE-UA 1XX) courses offered in the College Core Curriculum. Alternatively, students who meet the prerequisites or take a placement exam may register for an appropriate calculus course at the level of Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or above. Other CAS courses that satisfy the QR requirement (in statistics, e.g.) are posted on the Core Curriculum website, core.cas.nyu.edu . Placement into Calculus and other Foundational Courses Students meeting any of the following criteria may enter Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211). The latter course is intended for majors in economics. In addition, students meeting any of the following criteria may register for Discrete Mathematics (MATH-UA 120), Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140), or Honors Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 148), although in the case of MATH-UA 148 the required grade in Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9) is an A-minus and not a C. SAT general test mathematics score of 670 or higher (for SAT taken in and after March 2016) SAT Subject Examination in Mathematics (level 1 or level 2) score of 650 or higher ACT mathematics score of 30 or higher Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus AB exam score of 3 or higher (must be 4 or 5 to earn credit) Mathematics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 357 AB subscore on the AP Calculus BC exam of 3 or higher (must be 4 or 5 to earn credit) AP Calculus BC exam score of 3 or higher (must be 4 or 5 to earn credit) A Level Mathematics score of C or higher (must be B or higher to earn credit; anyone who took Further Mathematics should consult the mathematics department for placement) AS Level Mathematics score of B or higher (no credit is awarded for AS exams) International Baccalaureate (IB) HL Mathematics score of 5 or higher (must be 6 or higher to earn credit) IB SL Mathematics score of 6 or higher (no credit is awarded for SL exams) IB SL Mathematics Studies score of 7 (no credit is awarded for SL exams) Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9) with a grade of C or higher (A-minus or higher for entry into MATH-UA 148), or equivalent Passing score on the departmental calculus placement exam Students who do not meet any of these prerequisites must take Algebra and Calculus (MATH-UA 9) and meet the minimum grade requirement before proceeding to any of the courses listed above. Advanced Placement with Credit Freshmen seeking advanced placement in the mathematics major or minor may present results of the Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus AB or BC Examination. A student who earns a 4 or 5 on the Calculus AB exam (or AB subscore) or a 4 on the Calculus BC exam will receive 4 points equivalent to Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) and will be placed into Calculus II (MATH-UA 122). A student who earns a score of 5 on the Calculus BC exam will receive 8 points, equivalent to both Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) and Calculus II (MATH-UA 122), and will be placed into Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) or Honors Calculus III (MATH-UA 129). For calculus equivalencies and placement for advanced standing credit in mathematics from International Baccalaureate (HL only), A Level, and other approved international examinations, please consult the admission section of this Bulletin or a CAS adviser. Advanced Placement without Credit The department periodically gives its own advanced placement exams for students who know the material covered in Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) and/or Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) and who wish to enter Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Calculus III (MATH-UA 123). There is also an examination to pass out of Calculus III (MATH-UA 123). If a student passes any of these exams, he or she is placed into the next course of the sequence; however, no college credit is given for the courses that are skipped. Major in Mathematics The major consists of thirteen 4-point courses (52 points) numbered MATH-UA 120 or higher. Calculus and Foundational Requirement Discrete Mathematics (MATH-UA 120) Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or advanced standing credit Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or advanced standing credit Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) or Honors Calculus III (MATH-UA 129) Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) or Honors Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 148) Mathematics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 358 Analysis and Algebra Requirement Analysis (MATH-UA 325) Algebra (MATH-UA 343) Either of these courses can be substituted by its more intensive counterpart: Honors Analysis I (MATH-UA 328) Honors Algebra I (MATH-UA 348) Students are strongly advised to take analysis before algebra.

Exceptions may be made for students who have already taken Mathematics for Economics for their declared or intended economics major; they must seek the approval of the Department of Mathematics for this substitution. All other students must follow the regular calculus sequence. Students may not register simultaneously for separate courses within the two sequences. Up to two computer science courses at the level of Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) or higher, or up to two graduate data science (DS-GA) courses, may be counted toward the thirteen courses required for the major. The prerequisites for DS-GA courses are Calculus III (MATH-UA 123), Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140), and programming experience in Python (preferred) or MATLAB. Probability is a recommended prerequisite. Students who complete the prehealth program may substitute at most two MATH-UA courses by any two of the following: General Physics I, II (PHYS-UA 11, 12) or Physics I, II (PHYS-UA 91, 93). However, if these physics courses are used towards the mathematics major, the computer science or data science courses will not apply towards the major. Students may double-count no more than two courses toward both the mathematics major and the requirements of another major or minor. Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option cannot count toward the major. A grade of C or higher is required in all courses used to fulfill major requirements. In addition, majors must maintain a 2.0 mathematics GPA. Students may petition to enroll in graduate mathematics courses and apply them to the under - graduate major. Permission is not granted until the student has completed Analysis (MATH-UA 325) and the available undergraduate course(s) on the same topic. Please see the undergraduate section of the department's website for more information and to request permission to enroll in a graduate course. All mathematics majors and minors are required to see an undergraduate faculty adviser to review their course of study and be advised on appropriate courses for each term. Inquire at the depart - ment office, Warren Weaver Hall, 251 Mercer Street, Room 625 or 627, or call 212-998-3005 for more information. Joint Major in Computer Science and Mathematics This is an interdisciplinary major (eighteen courses/72 points) offered by the Department of Computer Science with the Department of Mathematics. Students must complete one CSCI-UA course with a recorded grade of C or higher before they can declare this joint major (this policy applies to all NYU students, not just to those matriculated in CAS). Students may double-count no more than two courses towards both this joint major and the requirements of another major or minor. A grade of C or higher is necessary in all courses used to fulfill joint major requirements (courses taken under the Pass/Fail option cannot be counted toward the major). Interested students should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in both departments for additional information. The mathematics requirements (ten courses/40 points) are as follows. Note that students must choose one calculus sequence or the other and cannot mix courses from both; they also cannot register simultaneously for separate courses within the two sequences. Discrete Mathematics (MATH-UA 120) Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) or Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) or Honors Calculus III (MATH-UA 129) or Mathematics for Economics III (MATH-UA 213) Mathematics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 360 Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) or Honors Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 148) Analysis (MATH-UA 325) or Honors Analysis I (MATH-UA 328) Algebra (MATH-UA 343) or Honors Algebra I (MATH-UA 348) The remaining three mathematics courses must include two of the following: Theory of Probability (MATH-UA 233), Mathematical Statistics (MATH-UA 234), Honors Theory of Proba - bility (MATH-UA 238), Mathematical Modeling (MATH-UA 251), Numerical Analysis (MATH-UA 252), Partial Differential Equations (MATH-UA 263), Functions of a Complex Variable (MATH- UA 282), Honors Analysis II (MATH-UA 329), Honors Algebra II (MATH-UA 349), or Differential Geometry (MATH-UA 377).

Joint Major in Economics and Mathematics An interdisciplinary major (eighteen courses/72 points) offered jointly by the Departments of Economics and Mathematics. In the economics department, joint majors with mathematics must follow the theory concentration. Nine courses must be taken in each department. Students may double-count no more than two courses towards both this joint major and the requirements of another major or minor. Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option cannot be counted toward the major. A grade of C or higher is necessary in all courses used to fulfill joint major requirements. Interested students should consult with the director of undergraduate studies in both departments for additional information. The nine mathematics courses (36 points) must all be numbered MATH-UA 120 or higher, and must include these five courses. Note that students must choose one calculus sequence or the other and cannot take courses from both; the Mathematics for Economics sequence is the preferred sequence for this joint major. Students also cannot register simultaneously for separate courses within the two sequences. Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) or Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Mathematics for Economics II (MATH-UA 212) or Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) Mathematics for Economics III (MATH-UA 213) or Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) or Honors Calculus III (MATH-UA 129) Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140) or Honors Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 148) Analysis (MATH-UA 325) or Honors Analysis I (MATH-UA 328) Four additional courses must be completed from the following choices: Theory of Probability (MATH-UA 233), Mathematical Statistics (MATH-UA 234), Probability and Statistics (MATH- UA 235), Combinatorics (MATH-UA 240), Theory of Numbers (MATH-UA 248), Mathematics of Finance (MATH-UA 250), Mathematical Modeling (MATH-UA 251), Numerical Analysis (MATH-UA 252), Ordinary Differential Equations (MATH-UA 262), Partial Differential Equations (MATH-UA Mathematics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 361 263), Chaos and Dynamical Systems (MATH-UA 264), Functions of a Complex Variable (MATH-UA 282), Honors Analysis II (MATH-UA 329), or Algebra (MATH-UA 343) or Honors Algebra I (MATH- UA 348). Note that if MATH-UA 235 is taken, then MATH-UA 233 and/or MATH-UA 234 may not be counted toward the major requirements; also note that if MATH-UA 233 and/or 234 is taken, then MATH-UA 235 may not be counted toward the major requirements. The economics requirements (nine courses/36 points) are as follows: Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 13) Analytical Statistics (ECON-UA 20), if not taking Mathematical Statistics (MATH-UA 234) Introduction to Econometrics (ECON-UA 266) Plus any three economics elective courses, at least two of which must be theory electives numbered ECON-UA 300 to 399. Note that students who take MATH-UA 234 instead of ECON-UA 20 for the statistics requirement must take a total of four ECON-UA electives. Minor in Mathematics The requirements are four 4-point courses (16 points) in the department, numbered MATH-UA 120 or higher. Courses from the sequences Calculus I, II, III (MATH-UA 121, 122, 123) and Math for Eco - nomics I, II, III (MATH-UA 211, 212, 213) cannot both be applied to the mathematics minor; students must choose one calculus sequence or the other and cannot take courses from both. They also cannot register simultaneously for separate courses within the two sequences. Although courses transferred from other colleges may count towards the minor with departmental approval, at least two courses for the minor must be taken at New York University. Students pursuing majors and/or other minors that require mathematics courses may follow this minor, as long as two of the four courses do not apply simultaneously to the requirements for their major and/or minor. Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not counted toward the minor. A grade of C or higher is required in all courses counting for the minor. Advisers are available for consultation on minor requirements before and during registration; students should consult an adviser if they have any doubt about which courses fulfill their requirements. Joint Minor in Computer Science and Mathematics The requirements are these four courses (16 points): Calculus I and II (MATH-UA 121, 122), or Mathematics for Economics I and II (MATH-UA 211, 212). Students must choose one calculus sequence or the other and cannot take courses from both. They also cannot register simultaneously for separate courses within the two sequences. Introduction to Computer Science (CSCI-UA 101) Data Structures (CSCI-UA 102) Students must complete one CSCI-UA course with a recorded grade of C or higher before they can declare this joint minor (this policy applies to all NYU students, not just to those matriculated in CAS). A grade of C or higher is required for courses to count toward the minor. Courses taken under the Pass/Fail option are not counted towards the minor. Students who wish to double- count courses for the math portion of the minor and another requirement may count at most two such courses toward the minor. At least two of the courses in total and at least one of the math courses must be taken in residence at New York University. Mathematics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 362 Minor in Advanced Mathematical Methods (for Students in Stern) The advanced mathematical methods minor (open only to Stern undergraduates) consists of four courses (typically 15 points) completed with a grade of C or higher.

It focuses on the history, institutions, languages, literatures, thought, faith, art, and music of Europe, the Atlantic, and the Mediterranean world from the collapse of Roman authority to about 1700 C.E. It is during this important period\u2014which shaped and transmit - ted the classical heritage\u2014that the social, artistic, intellectual, and scientific culture of present-day Europe and the Middle East was formed. The curriculum in medieval and Renaissance studies links undergraduates with NYU's outstanding humanities faculty; with the superb libraries, museums, and collections in the New York area; and with musical and theatrical performances of works from this period that are given regularly in the city. It also enriches students' intellectual and artistic experience in College of Arts and Science study away programs. Students design their own programs in consultation with the program director and faculty; they thus receive individualized attention from a center of excellence situated within the rich offerings of a great university and a vibrant city. Many majors in the program in medieval and Renaissance studies have gone on to graduate work in medieval studies, early modern studies, Celtic studies, archival and/or museum studies, religious studies, history, art history, English, foreign language literatures and cultures, and music.

It is specifically designed for students wishing to work in more than one field of specializatio n and to develop individualized programs of study around their own interests rather than those of a single departmental major. Individual advisement enables students to develop a coherent course of study that suits their needs and interests. Among the fields of concentration from which students may draw to develop their programs are (1) language and literature: classics, comparative literature, English, French, German, Hebrew and Judaic studies, Italian, Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, and Spanish and Portuguese; (2) art history; (3) history; (4) music; and (5) philosophy and religion. Other more specialized programs of study may be designed in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Available to majors and minors is the Marco Polo Travel Award (granted to an outstanding student each year to allow her or him to travel abroad for research), as well as a field prize for outstanding work in the major. Major: Requirements The major requires ten courses (40 points) in medieval and Renaissance studies, all completed with a grade of C or better. At least five of the ten courses must be in a single field of concentration; three courses must be in one or more secondary field(s) of concentration; and at least one must be an interdisciplinary seminar. In addition, majors are expected to demonstrate proficiency through course work or examination in a classical language (Latin, ancient Greek, Arabic, or Hebrew) and in another foreign language appropriate to their field of concentration. Students who work in later periods and for whom knowledge of two modern foreign languages is advantageous may petition the director of undergraduate studies to substitute the ancient language requirement with a second modern foreign language. Minor Five courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better: two courses in a single field of concentration, one course in each of two other fields of concentration, and an interdisciplinary seminar. Program Approval and Advisement The director meets with students to discuss their general educational and career aims, as well Medieval and Renaissance Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 375 as the specific opportunities provided by the program in medieval and Renaissance studies. All major and minor programs require the approval of the director of the program. Honors Program To qualify for the honors program in the medieval and Renaissance studies major, students must maintain at least a 3.65 cumulative average and a 3.65 major average. The honors track is a yearlong 8-point program, which requires students to write and orally defend a senior honors thesis. During the fall semester of their senior year, students who qualify for honors enroll in the Senior Honors Seminar (MEDI-UA 999); in the spring semester, they enroll in Honors Independent Study (MEDI-UA 998). The Senior Honors Seminar guides students through the research and writing of the thesis. In Honors Independent Study, students complete their honors theses under the supervision of a faculty mentor. Students interested in honors must consult with the director of the program by the end of junior year. Accelerated B.A./M.A. Program Qualifying students may apply to earn an accelerated B.A. in medieval and Renaissance studies and an M.A. in a related department. Interested students must consult with the director of the program. Requirements for the B.A./M.A. program are outlined in the pre-professional, accelerated, and specialized programs section of this Bulletin. Study Away The program prepares and encourages its students to complement their work in medieval and Renaissance studies with a semester at one of NYU's academic centers in Florence, London, Madrid, Paris, and Prague, or at one of the Western European exchange universities.

Medieval and Renaissance Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22MAJOR/MINOR IN Metropolitan Studies Director of Metropolitan Studies Professor Sugrueas.nyu.edu/metropolitanstudies 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor New York, NY 10003-7112 212-992-9650 Metropolitan Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 380 OVERVIEWThe interdisciplinary program in metropolitan studies, housed in the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA), studies urban spaces in relation to the rural and suburban contexts that help to define them. With the New York metropolitan area as their laboratory, students use course work, internships, and research investigations to examine how social institutions and policy initiatives address demographic concerns and matters of infrastructure. Studying with faculty and scholars active in government, community, and nonprofit agencies, students develop a critical understanding of the way cities, suburbs, and rural areas are produced, as well as key problems they experience in tension with each other. An accelerated B.A./M.P.A. and B.A./M.U.P. arrangement exists with NYU's Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. For more information, see the section on preprofessional, accelerated, and specialized programs in this Bulletin. n Major The metropolitan studies major requires nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better. Two introductory courses\u2014may be taken in either order: Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101) Approaches to Metropolitan Studies (SCA-UA 601) Six elective courses: Six designated metropolitan studies electives, of which four must be taught by SCA faculty. SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program (SCA-UA 42) is no longer required but is highly recommended and can count as an elective. One research course: Advanced Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90)Professors ZaloomAssistant Professor GonickFACULTY PROGRAM 381 Minor Five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better are required for the minor in Metropolitan studies. Students must take Approaches to Metropolitan Studies (SCA-UA 601). They also take four designated metropolitan studies electives, of which two must be taught by SCA faculty. Language and Linguistic Competency The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within and across different social groups. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in language and linguistics by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science; studying languages especially germane to the department's fields of study; pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research away in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. Policy on Double Counting of Courses Majors may share (double count) two courses with a second major, with permission from the other department/program. Minors may share (double count) one course with a major or a second minor, with permission from the other department/program. Honors Program Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year.

It adopts interdisciplinary and comparative approaches to Middle Eastern societies from antiquity to the present, with particular focus on the period after the emergence of Islam. A Middle Eastern and Islamic studies major offers students the opportunity to master one of the regional languages, including Arabic, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu. Students also acquire an interdisciplinary understanding of this pivotal area of the world by studying with the department's specialists in history, anthropology, political science, literature, law, religious studies, and language. In addition to the courses listed below, students are encouraged to select cross-listed courses in other departments and programs that complement the department's offerings, such as anthropology, art history, comparative literature, Hebrew and Judaic studies, history, politics, religious studies, and sociology. n Major: General Requirements The Middle Eastern and Islamic studies (MEIS) major requires ten 4-point courses (40 points) completed with a grade of C or better. (Courses graded pass/fail cannot count toward the requirements of the major.) The major consists of two components: (1) language study and (2) non-language courses. All MEIS majors must complete at least six non-language courses (24 points); the number of language courses required for the major depends on one's beginning level of proficiency in the language chosen for study, but could be as many as four. Students who take Professors Emeriti Chelkowski, Khorrami, McChesney, Mikhail, Peters, Language Lecturers Alnaemi, Hassan, Naqvi Language Lecturers Alizadeh, BadawiAssociated Faculty Tawil-Souri Affiliated Faculty Antoon, Fleming, Flood, Gomez, Kapchan, PearceFACULTY 386 fewer than four language courses must take more than the minimum of six non-language courses, so as to complete a full ten courses in Middle Eastern and Islamic studies. Language Study Required for the Major To obtain the B.A. degree with a Middle Eastern and Islamic studies (MEIS) major, students must meet the College of Arts and Science (CAS) language requirement in Arabic, Hindi, Persian, Turkish, or Urdu. This means (1) studying one of these languages through at least the intermediate two level (four semesters) at NYU, (2) demonstrating the completion of approved and equivalent course work elsewhere, or (3) satisfying the CAS language requirement by taking the CAS placement exam in one of these languages. Under exceptional circumstances, the director of undergraduate studies may exempt a student from having to fulfill the language requirement, in which case the student will be required to take ten MEIS non-language courses to complete the major. In any event, every student must always complete at least ten MEIS-approved courses to satisfy requirements for the major. Non-Language Course Requirements for the Major In addition to the language requirement, majors must successfully complete at least six MEIS content courses distributed across distinct fields. The six MEIS courses are to be distributed as follows. Two core courses: To ensure broad knowledge of issues in the discipline, all majors must take two \"core courses\" among their six non-language courses. It is recommended that students take these courses before they take seminars and topics courses. Core courses are as follows: MEIS-UA 690: The Emergence of the Modern Middle East (History) MEIS-UA 697: Palestine, Zionism, and Israel (History) MEIS-UA 711: Literature and Society in the Middle East (Literature) MEIS-UA 728: Women and Gender in Islam (Religion) MEIS-UA 750: Middle East Politics (Elective) The department may choose to designate additional courses as core courses and will announce them accordingly. Core courses must be taken at Washington Square and cannot be taken while studying away at an NYU global academic center. One topics/seminar course: Among the six non-language courses, all majors must also take at least one advanced undergraduate seminar; MEIS often offers these under the \"topics\" rubric (e.g. MEIS-UA 688: Topics in Middle East History). With permission, this requirement may be fulfilled with a graduate seminar. Distribution fields: All majors must take their six non-language courses (including the core and topics courses) in a manner that is distributed across departmental fields as follows: Two courses from the MEIS history list One course from the MEIS literature list One course from the MEIS religion list Two elective courses from the MEIS course list of the student's choice Minor Students who wish to minor in Middle Eastern and Islamic studies must complete either: Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 387 four non-language courses (16 points) with a C or better, including one of the core courses listed above (the courses must be offered or cross-listed by MEIS and approved by the director of undergraduate studies or a MEIS adviser); or four courses (16 points) with a C or better in Arabic, Persian, or Turkish, provided that these courses are not also used to satisfy the CAS foreign language requirement. Only the non-language minor can be used to satisfy the Expressive Culture requirement of the College Core Curriculum. Policy on Transfer and NYU Study Away (Global) Credits (Major and Minor) After consultation with the director of undergraduate studies, transfer students may be allowed to apply up to five transfer courses (20 points) toward the major or up to two transfer courses (8 points) toward the minor. At least half of the major and minor courses must always be completed in CAS. NYU study away/Global courses (e.g., NYU Abu Dhabi) may be considered and treated as transfer credits, even for students matriculated in CAS. Majors and minors in Middle Eastern and Islamic studies should discuss their study away plans with the director of undergraduate studies. Internships MEIS majors may, with permission of the director of undergraduate studies, pursue an internship for 2 or 4 points (MEIS-UA 980, 981). The application form is available in the MEIS office. Honors Program Any student majoring in the department who has spent at least two full years in residence at the College of Arts and Science, has completed at least 60 points of graded work in the College, and has both a cumulative and a major GPA of 3.65 may apply to pursue honors in the MEIS major. The requirements are: Complete all major requirements (above). Complete at least two graduate-level courses with a GPA of 3.0 (these courses may be used to satisfy part of the major requirements); students are encouraged to complete the interdepart - mental Honors Thesis Seminar when offered. Write an honors thesis of 50 to 60 double-spaced, typed pages under the supervision of an MEIS faculty member, for which up to 4 points of independent study credit may be awarded (MEIS-UA 997, 998). The subject of the honors thesis and the faculty supervisor are chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Awards The department offers the following awards for excellence: The Baba-e-Urdu Prize, for excellence in Urdu studies The Rumi-Biruni Prize, for excellence in Persian studies The Evliya Chelebi Prize, for excellence in Turkish studies The Ibn Khaldun Prize, for excellence in Arabic studies The Premchand Prize, for excellence in Hindi studies The Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies Prize, presented to a graduating senior in the honors program Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 388 Minor in South Asian Studies The minor in South Asian Studies (SAS) is housed in the Department of History.

Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF Music Chair of the Department Associate Professor Samuelsas.nyu.edu/music Waverly Building 24 Waverly Place, Room 268 New York, NY 10003-6789 212-998-8300Director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Cohen Music / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 393 OVERVIEW PROGRAMThe Department of Music offers both a major and a minor in music. Both programs give students the opportunity to gain proficiency in the theory, history, and interpretation of music throughout the world, and help them build a solid set of applied critical and listening abilities demanded of musicians and listeners today. The major offers students opportunities for independent research during their final year. The department teaches a wide range of innovative courses in ethnomusicology, popular music, the cultural study of music, and sound studies. Many of these courses are open to non-majors. Some recent courses include: Music in the Post-9/11 World; Introduction to World Music; Music in New York; Music, Global Hip-Hop, and the Politics of Culture; and Music, Sound, and Technology. The department's Waverly Labs provide digital resources for composition and research. The department hosts the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society and a number of other performing ensembles and initiatives. Our majors and minors may also take private instrumental instruction with department support, and are eligible to join performance ensembles at the Steinhardt School. Our students take advantage of our location in one of the world's major cul - tural centers by attending concerts and pursuing internships with New York recording companies, music magazines, or major performing arts organizations. n Departmental Objectives The breadth and depth of knowledge offered by the major provide an excellent foundation for academic, creative, and performance work, offering a solid set of applied critical and listening abilities. The major is equally ideal for students seeking careers requiring a solid liberal arts background and strong analytical and critical skills, and for students interested in humanistic Professors Emeriti Boorman, Roesner Collegiate Professor; Carrol Professor BeckermanProfessors Cusick, Hoffman, Karchin Associate Professors Cohen, Daughtry, Mahon, Oliver, SamuelsAssistant Professor Dang Global Distinguished Professor Moloney Clinical Assistant Professors Terry-Cabrera, TeyssierAffiliated Faculty Bravo (NYU Abu Dhabi) Eisenberg (NYU Abu Dhabi) Kapchan (Performance Studies, Tisch) Quayle (NYU Abu Dhabi)FACULTY 394 fields in which sonic culture is a central element. The music major cultivates the ability to interpret and analyze music as both text and performance. It gives students a broad understanding of the various issues currently being discussed in musical thinking and research, as well as a grounding in theory and the opportunity to engage in creative work. Qualified students can undertake advanced supervised research or composition in their senior year, leading to a thesis and the award of honors in the major. The major program of study and our faculty's specializations offer superb foundations for further advanced studies in music as well as disciplines such as American studies, comparative literature, linguistic and cultural anthropology, Native American studies, popular culture, gender studies, Western and Central European culture and history, Slavic studies, Latin American and Latino studies, media studies, performance studies, and theatre. Major The major in music requires a total of ten 4-point courses (40 points) completed with a grade of C or better, as follows: Aural Perception (MUSIC-UA 193) Music Theory I and II (MUSIC-UA 201 and 202) Two courses in the area of music, history, and cultures Two courses in the area of sonic art Three electives, one of which must be designated as an advanced course. The advanced course is taken in fall of senior year. Students may count up to four points of performance classes in our department or in the Stein - hardt School's Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions toward the music major. Minor A total of four courses (16 points) completed with a grade of C or better is required for the music minor: One course in music theory One course in the area of music, history, and cultures One course in the area of sonic art or one additional course in the area of music, history, and cultures One additional course numbered at or above the MUSIC-UA 100 level. Four points of performance (from our department or Steinhardt) may be used for this requirement. Policies Applying to the Major and Minor A grade of C or higher is required for a course to count toward the major or minor; courses graded Pass/Fail do not count. The College awards 4 points for a score of 4 or 5 on the Advanced Placement examination in Music Theory and counts this as elective credit toward the baccalaureate degree, but the credits do not count toward the music major or minor. CAS does not award any credit for International Baccalaureate or any other advanced standing examinations in music. Honors Program Highly motivated students may take part in the department's honors program, which culminates Music / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 395 during the senior year with an independent study supervised by a faculty member. Students must have a 3.65 GPA both in the major and overall to pursue honors. Honors students register for a semester or more of Independent Study (MUSIC-UA 997 or 998) in which they complete a capstone project in musicology or music history, ethnomusicology, analysis, or composition. This might take the form of an analytical or historiographical study of a major work or group of works, the writing of a musical composition of substantial dimensions, or a biographical study of a composer, all under the guidance of a faculty member. A student wishing to pursue departmental honors should apply to the director of undergraduate studies. There are also three departmental prizes that the department awards to exceptional students (listed in the awards and prizes section of this Bulletin). Performance Students pursuing a major or minor in music, and indeed all students in the College of Arts and Science, are encouraged to participate in musical performance, lessons, and ensembles. We believe that the joys of making music, the dedication and study necessary to perform music, and the collective effort required of ensemble participants constitute an inimitable experience that should have a central place in a liberal arts education. Students can participate in the Collegium Musicum, the NYU Orchestra, and many of the lessons, programs, and ensembles associated with our de - partment or the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development's Department of Music and Performing Arts Professions. Students are also invited to attend concerts of the Washington Square Contemporary Music Society. In addition to participation in the various performance ensembles, the department encourages students to partake vigorously of the cultural life of New York City. Students are entitled to discounted tickets to the Metropolitan Opera, the New York Philharmonic, concerts of the World Music Institute, concerts of the Kalavant Center for Indian Music and Dance, and many other music-presenting organizations.

Even the original name of this island, Manahahtaan, reflects its Indigeneity\u2014this is a Munsee word describing the hickory trees clustered at its southern tip. Today, New York City has the largest urban population of Native American and Indigenous residents in the United States. Native American and Indigenous studies (NAIS) is an interdisciplinary field that draws on research in many disciplines across the College of Arts and Science, from the humanities to the social and natural sciences. Students minoring in NAIS explore the histories, cultures, and politics of Indigenous populations both within the Americas and beyond by taking courses in a wide array of departments, including but not limited to anthropology, art history, Caribbean and Latin American studies, creative writing, English, environmental studies, global public health, history, music, politics, public policy, and social and cultural analysis. The five-course Native American and Indigenous studies minor introduces students to the main questions and debates in the field. It broadly educates students while also promoting student and faculty scholarship about the complexity and diversity of the cultures and histories of Indigenous peoples in the Americas and around the world. The minor encourages students to understand and assess the unique relationships between Indigenous people and governments. It asks students to analyze the contributions of Indigenous peoples to global society as well as the difficulties confronting Indigenous peoples and tribal nations. Finally, it provides students with foundational knowledge to assist them in finding innovative solutions to any number of challenges facing Indigenous populations worldwide. n Professor Salda\u00f1a (Social and Cultural Analysis)Associate Professors Anderson (Anthropology), Goetz (History), Needham (History), Saranillio (Social and Cultural Analysis)Assistant Professor Ellis (History)FACULTYMinor The minor in Native American and Indigenous studies requires five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better, as follows: Introduction to Native American and Indigenous Studies: The Politics of Indigeneity (ANTH-UA 747/HIST-UA 747/SCA-UA 747) Four additional 4-point courses, one of which must address Native American or Indigenous communities in a historical context. Courses must be approved by the director. Policies Applying to the Minor Courses graded Pass/Fail do not count toward the minor. Students may count up to two Indigenous language courses toward the minor. Students may double count up to two NAIS minor courses toward their major or another minor, so long as each department or program agrees. Students may petition the director as follows: To count one College Core Curriculum course toward the minor (see list of approved courses). To count one related internship course toward the minor. To count one Gallatin course (and only one) toward the minor. To count a course that does not focus on NAIS but is relevant to a student's academic interest in the field. For example, if a student wishes to focus on gender and sexuality in Native American and/or Indigenous communities, the director might allow the student to count one course in gender and sexuality studies toward the minor. 399 PROGRAM COURSES Core Course Introduction to Native American Studies ANTH-UA 747 Identical to HIST-UA 747 , SCA-UA 747 . Required of all minors. Anderson, Ellis. 4 points. Introduces central questions and debates: Indigenous hidden histories and oral histories; comparative Indigeneities; questions of \"discovery\" and colonialism; the politics and representations of lands, massacres, and museums; and aspects of law, gender, and sexuality.

Experimental approaches in neural science vary from analyses of molecular and cellular mechanisms in nerve cells and groups of nerve cells to behavioral and psychological studies of whole organisms. Theoretical tools include mathematical and computational modeling approaches that have proved useful in other areas of science. Experimental questions include issues related to biophysical and neurochemical mechanisms within single nerve cells, functional neural circuits consisting of small numbers of neurons, the behavior of large systems of neurons, and the relationship between the activity of elements of the nervous system and the behavior of organisms. The Center for Neural Science confers the B.S. degree in neural science. n Major The neural science major (a minor is not offered) requires fifteen courses (63 points). It requires these six courses (24 points) offered by the Center for Neural Science: Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) Cellular Neurobiology (NEURL-UA 210) Behavioral and Integrative Neuroscience (NEURL-UA 220) Three elective courses in neural science (may include NEURL-UA 302, NEURL-UA 305)Henry And Lucy Moses Professor of Science and University Professor; Professor of Neural Science and Psychology LeDoux Natalie Clews Spencer Professor of the Sciences; Professor of Neural Science, Biology, and Psychology ShapleySilver Professor; Professor of Neural Science, Economics, and Psychology Glimcher Silver Professor; Professor of Neural Science and Psychology MovshonCollegiate Professor; Professor of Neural Science and Psychology Kiorpes Peron, Savin, Schneider Global Distinguished Professor DudaiFACULTY 403 The balance of the major requirements (nine courses/39 points) is taken in other departments, as follows: General Chemistry and Laboratory I, II (CHEM-UA 125, 126) Principles of Biology I, II (BIOL-UA 11, 12) Molecular and Cell Biology I (BIOL-UA 21) General Physics II (PHYS-UA 12). Please note that General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11), or credit for AP Physics C (Mechanics), is a prerequisite for General Physics II. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis by the Department of Physics. Students are not automatically permitted to take PHYS-UA 12 before/without PHYS-UA 11. Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) One approved statistics course, such as Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) One approved upper-level course in either psychology or biology Prehealth students must take, in addition to the above, Principles of Biology Lab (BIOL-UA 123), General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11), Organic Chemistry and Laboratory I, II (CHEM-UA 225, 226), and Biochemistry I (CHEM-UA 881). These courses are not required for the major in neural science. AP or other advanced standing credit is only accepted for the calculus and statistics requirements. This is on a case-by-case basis and must be approved by a neural science adviser. Students may declare the major before they have completed Introduction to Neural Science (NEURL-UA 100) with the required B-minus or higher. However, they must earn a B-minus or better in NEURL-UA 100 to remain declared. (A grade of C or better is required for all other courses in the major.) Note that Introduction to Neural Science is offered only in the spring term. Students may take it as early as their first year if they are well-prepared and their schedules permit it, but taking it in the spring of their sophomore year does not endanger their ability to complete this major and graduate in two more years. Students should meet with a neural science adviser as early in their NYU career as possible (freshman year is recommended). Honors Program To graduate with honors in neural science, students must achieve a GPA of 3.65 in both the major and overall. In the fall semester of their senior year, students seeking honors must complete the Honors Seminar (NEURL-UA 301). In the spring of their senior year, they must present a paper at the College's annual Undergraduate Research Conference and the department's Undergraduate Research Conference and submit an honors thesis that is accepted by the faculty sponsor and the director of undergraduate studies. Admittance to the laboratory courses associated with Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology (NEURL-UA 210) and Behavioral and Integrative Neuroscience (NEURL-UA 220) is assured and required only for students in the honors track.

The four main branches are metaphysics (What is the ultimate nature of reality? What really exists and what is mere appearance?), epistemology (What, if anything, can be known and how?), logic (What are the principles of correct reasoning?), and ethics (What is moral value? And what moral values should we adopt?). Other, more specific branches of philosophy address questions concerning the nature of art, law, medicine, politics, religion, and the sciences. Everyone tends to have or assume answers to these questions. The aim of the department is to enable students to identify, clarify, and assess these answers, both ancient and modern. Philosophy prepares students for a more reflective life, for advanced studies in the subject, and for professions that emphasize analytic thinking and argumentation, such as law, business, and programming. n Professors Emeriti Kamm, Nagel, Ruddick, Velleman University Professor; Silver Professor; Professor of Philosophy Field University Professor; Silver Professor; Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics Fine University Professor; Professor of Philosophy SchefflerSilver Professor; Professor of Philosophy and Psychology Block Silver Professors; Professors of Philosophy Boghossian, Garrett, Longuenesse, Schiffer Professor of Philosophy and Law Appiah Professor of Philosophy and Classics MalinkProfessors Chalmers, Dorr, Foley, Hopkins, Horwich, Maudlin, Moss, Richardson, Street, Strevens, Unger Associate Professors Franklin-Hall, Jauernig Assistant Professors Friedman, Mandelkern, Viehoff Global Distinguished Professor Wright Bersoff Fellows Johnson, Johnson King, McNultyAssociated Faculty Jamieson, Murphy, Shaw, Waldron Affiliated Faculty Bain, de Vries, Liao, Mitsis, Sebo Affiliated NYU Abu Dhabi Faculty Coffey, Ganeri, Kukkonen, Paul, Rabin, Silverstein Affiliated Nyu Shanghai Faculty Teng, WeslakeFACULTYMajor in Philosophy A major in philosophy requires ten 4-point courses (40 points) in the department.

For advisement, language and mind majors should consult with the directors of undergraduate studies of the participating departments. Minor in Philosophy A minor in philosophy requires four 4-point courses (16 points) in the department. These four courses must include one (and only one) introductory course (PHIL-UA 1-7), and one course from each of the department's three subject groupings: Group 1: History of Philosophy Group 2: Ethics, Values, and Society Group 3: Logic, Epistemology, Metaphysics, Mind and Language No credit toward the minor is awarded for a course with a grade lower than C. Independent Study A student may register for an independent study course (PHIL-UA 301, 302; 2 or 4 points per term) if he or she obtains the consent of a faculty member who approves the study project and agrees to serve as adviser. The student must also obtain the approval of either the department chair or the director of undergraduate studies. The student may take no more than one such course in any given semester and no more than two such courses in total, unless granted special permission by either the department chair or the director of undergraduate studies. Philosophy / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 408 Honors Program Honors in philosophy will be awarded to majors who (1) have a GPA of 3.65 or higher both in philosophy and overall and (2) successfully complete the honors program. The program requires eleven courses in philosophy, ten of which satisfy the requirements of the ordinary philosophy major. The eleventh course is a 6-credit, two-term thesis project. The department offers two Advanced Seminars: PHIL-UA 200 in the spring semester and PHIL-UA 201 in the fall. The honors program requires both of these seminars, at least one of which must be taken before the end of the junior year. (At the discretion of the director of undergraduate studies, a seminar with the same number may be taken twice, provided the topics covered are sufficiently different.) These seminars are open to all students having at least a GPA of 3.65 in philosophy and overall, whether or not they plan to apply to the honors program. The seminars introduce students to a variety of topics that are appropriate for honors theses. In the normal case, these seminars will count as electives toward the philosophy major. Students wishing to enter the honors program must submit a thesis proposal, endorsed by a faculty thesis advisor, before the end of their junior year. In the normal case, the proposal will consist of a paper that the student plans to expand into an honors thesis. It is not required that the paper be written in an advanced seminar, although the seminars will provide opportunities for writing papers appropriate for this purpose. (The thesis advisor need not be the faculty member who taught the course in which the paper was originally written.) Upon admission into the honors program, students are expected to read for the thesis over the summer between junior and senior years. Students then enroll in Honors Thesis Workshop (PHIL-UA 202) in the fall of the senior year. This is a 6-point course consisting of independent thesis work (under the advisor's supervision) plus a thesis-writing discussion workshop (led by a member of the faculty). The thesis is due at the end of January term of the senior year, with oral thesis exams to be held in the first week of the spring semester.

Philosophy / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF Physics Chair of the Department Professor Kleban Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Weineras.nyu.edu/physics 726 Broadway, 8th-10th Floors New York, NY 10003 212-998-7700Physics Adviser Professor Moscatelli Physics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 413 OVERVIEW PROGRAMPhysics is the most basic of the natural sciences. It is concerned with understanding the world on all scales of length, time, and energy. The methods of physics are diverse, but they share a common objective to develop and refine fundamental models that quantitatively explain observations and the results of experiments. The discoveries of physics rank among the most important achievements of human inquiry and have had an enormous impact on human culture and civilization. Members of the department conduct research in the fields of astrophysics, biophysics, cosmology, elementary particle physics, gravitation, hard and soft condensed matter physics, and statistical physics, carrying out experimental work in state-of-the art laboratories in the department and at such national and international facilities as the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and large astronomical observatories. The educational programs of the department are aimed at providing a range of courses to meet the needs of different student groups. For undergraduate physics majors, there is a rigorous core program, exposure to current frontiers, and opportunities for research. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses that emphasize the fundamental physical laws that underpin other sciences; and for other majors, nontechnical courses introduce some of the most important concepts of physics and their impact on the contemporary world. n Departmental Objectives The B.A. and B.S. programs for the major provide good preparation for graduate school and develop a range of technical skills relating to building quantitative theoretical models and making Professors Emeriti Bederson, Brown, Glassgold, Hoffert, Hohenberg, Levy, Lowenstein, Richardson, Professors of ZidovskaClinical Professors Adler, MoscatelliFACULTY 414 precise measurements of physical phenomena. The programs are also designed to satisfy curiosity about the fundamental laws that govern every aspect of the world, from the interactions of subatomic particles to the origin and behavior of the entire universe. They are simultaneously very deep and very broad. Course work includes both theoretical subjects and experimental activity in laboratories. The programs are designed to give students flexibility in years three and four to pursue interdisciplinary activities, spend time abroad, or delve into greater depth in a subject or into original research. The department is a collegial place where faculty and students get to know one another well. There are regular formal and informal seminars, as well as a thriving Society of Physics Students, and students and faculty often collaborate on original research problems. Many majors participate in original research and coauthor scientific publications. Our students are extremely well prepared for a wide range of activities\u2014not just in scientific research, but also in professional and engineer - ing pursuits, or any area where abstract thinking and quantitative modeling of real systems are necessary and rewarded. For non-majors, the department offers non-technical courses that introduce some of the concepts and events that are most important to understanding physics and its impact. For science majors outside of physics, there are technical courses on the fundamental laws that underpin the other sciences. The department also provides courses designed to meet the preprofessional goals of prehealth students and students in engineering disciplines. In addition, students who are interested in obtaining significant exposure to the ideas of physics without committing to the major or without obtaining a comprehensive mathematical background can minor in physics or astronomy. Major in Physics, Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) This major program consists of the following eighteen courses (53 to 55 points) completed with a grade of C or better: Year 1: Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) Calculus II (MATH-UA 122) Physics I (PHYS-UA 91) and Introductory Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 71) (5 points together) Physics II (PHYS-UA 93) and Introductory Experimental Physics II (PHYS-UA 72) (5 points together) Year 2: Calculus III (MATH-UA 123) Physics III (PHYS-UA 95) and Intermediate Experimental Physics I (PHYS-UA 73) (5 points together) Dynamics (PHYS-UA 120) Intermediate Experimental Physics II (PHYS-UA 74) Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 106) Years 3 and 4: Advanced Experimental Physics (PHYS-UA 112) Quantum Mechanics I (PHYS-UA 123) Electricity and Magnetism I (PHYS-UA 131) Thermal and Statistical Physics (PHYS-UA 140) Two advanced physics electives (3 or 4 points each) Physics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 415 Students planning to do graduate work in physics or related areas are advised to take the following courses in year 3 or 4: Quantum Mechanics II (PHYS-UA 124) and Computational Physics (PHYS-UA 210). Major in Physics, Bachelor of Science (B.S.) This optional major program provides breadth in the sciences in addition to physics. The B.S. degree in physics will be granted to students completing the following: The required courses for the B.A. major (see above), but with only one advanced physics elective instead of two Computational Physics (PHYS-UA 210) Two courses in chemistry at or above the level of General Chemistry I, II (CHEM-UA 125, 126), or the one-semester course Accelerated General Chemistry (CHEM-UA 129) One course in biology at or above the level of Principles of Biology I (BIOL-UA 11), or in chemistry above the level of General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126) Acceptable Advanced Electives in Physics for the B.A. and B.S. Majors These courses are offered in either the fall or spring term (not both), and some are not offered every year. Please see course descriptions in this Bulletin for prerequisites and frequency of offering. Additional electives may be available; majors should contact the Department of Physics for information. Electronics for Scientists (PHYS-UA 110) Advanced Mathematical Physics (PHYS-UA 115) Quantum Mechanics II (PHYS-UA 124) Electricity and Magnetism II (PHYS-UA 132) Optics (PHYS-UA 133) Condensed Matter Physics (PHYS-UA 135) Readings in Particle Physics (PHYS-UA 136) Quantum Information and Computing (PHS-UA 138) Astrophysics (PHYS-UA 150) Physics of Biology (PHYS-UA 160) General Relativity (PHYS-UA 170) Introduction to Fluid Dynamics (PHYS-UA 180) Philosophy of Physics (PHYS-UA 190) Computational Physics (PHYS-UA 210) Special Topics in Physics (PHYS-UA 800) Notes on the Major Advanced Placement (AP) credit : In the summer before their freshman year, students considering a major in physics may consult with the department about possibly counting credit for AP Physics C: Mechanics and/or AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism toward the major and placing out of Physics I (PHYS-UA 91) and/or Physics II (PHYS-UA 93), respectively. Students are usually advised, however, to take Physics I and II at NYU as a foundation for doing well in the major curriculum. If majors are granted permission to place out of PHYS-UA 91 and 93, they must still complete the laboratory classes that are taken with those lectures (Introductory Experimental Physics I and II, PHYS-UA 71 and 72). They are also required to take (with departmental advisement) one or two additional advanced PHYS-UA electives (beyond the basic major requirement of two advanced electives in this department). Finally, physics majors who are prehealth must be sure to present Physics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 416 a year of physics with labs to meet admissions requirements of health professional schools; they cannot rely on their Physics AP C exams to meet the requirements of these schools. No other AP credit in physics (or from similar international exams) can be applied to the requirements of the physics major. Although Physics I and Physics II have a number of topics that are nominally included in the AP Physics C curriculum, they are all treated in greater depth and with more rigor in our courses, which use differential and integral calculus. In addition, Physics I and Physics II cover several topics that are not included in a high school AP course. These include approximately two weeks on Einstein's theory of special relativity in Physics I, and AC circuits, phasors, electromagnetic radiation, Maxwell's equations, and Poynting's theorem in Physics II. Students with credit for either or both of the AP Physics C exams will not find Physics I and II to be redundant. Mathematics requirement: Potential physics majors should begin their calculus sequence in the fall semester of their freshman year. Students are advised to take advanced mathematics courses\u2014such as Linear Algebra (MATH-UA 140)\u2014as they proceed in the major. Double major with physics: The major offers flexibility to complete the requirements for a second major in the College. Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies in their freshman year to outline a program that is best tailored to their needs. Program in Physics and Engineering The College of Arts and Science offers a joint B.S./B.S. program with the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. The program leads to the B.S. degree in physics from CAS and the B.S. degree in one of the following areas from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering: civil engineering; computer engineering; electrical engineering; or mechanical engineering. Further information is available from the College Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Policy on School of Engineering courses: This option is open only to students with declared majors in the Department of Physics. They may seek prior permission of the director of under - graduate studies to take advanced electives in the School of Engineering and apply them to the major. This is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. These courses count against each student's 16-point allowance in the other divisions of NYU and cannot be applied to the 64 point UA residency requirement. Minor in Physics Consists of four courses from the following list, or three of the following and one of the courses listed under the minor in astronomy (all completed with a grade of C or better): General Physics I (PHYS-UA 11) General Physics II (PHYS-UA 12) Introduction to Cosmology (PHYS-UA 15) 20th-Century Concepts of Space, Time, and Matter (PHYS-UA 20) Any course at or above Physics I (PHYS-UA 91), except for pure laboratory courses Minor in Astronomy Provides a comprehensive introduction to astronomy, including modern concepts, historical ideas, and observational experience. Consists of four courses. The Universe: Its Nature and History (PHYS-UA 7) is required, as are the following three courses (or two of the following courses and Physics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 417 one of the courses listed under the minor in physics), all completed with a grade of C or better: Observational Astronomy (PHYS-UA 13) Introduction to Cosmology (PHYS-UA 15) Astrophysics (PHYS-UA 150) Honors Program Students who have completed at least 64 points of graded work in the College may be awarded degrees with departmental honors in physics if they complete all requirements of the major as well as the designated honors requirements, and also maintain the requisite grade point average of 3.65 both in the major and overall. The honors program must minimally be a two-term (for credit) research experience that includes a capstone research project. The capstone project, which typically culminates in a thesis, should reflect sustained original research over two semesters. A committee of three faculty members of the Department of Physics is created for each honors student. The honors thesis must be approved by the committee, who will judge if the research is of sufficient quality. Publication in a recognized research journal of an article reporting research done primarily by the student is prima facie evidence that the research is deserving of honors. Because of inevitable delay in publication, an article submitted for publication may not be published in the time available, and the thesis committee may express its opinion that the thesis is of publishable quality. All students completing departmental honors must make public presentations of their work, which may be at the CAS Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) held at the end of the academic year, or in a departmental forum (e.g., oral defenses or presentations), or at a recog - nized physics conference.

Physics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22WILF FAMILY DEPARTMENT OF Politics Chair of the Department Professor Gordon as.nyu.edu/politics 19 West Fourth Street, 2nd Floor New York, NY 10012-1119 212-998-8500Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Gilligan Politics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 422 OVERVIEWA vibrant home for those interested in government and public affairs, the Wilf Family Department of Politics gives students the skills needed to reach a deeper analytical understanding of political events that is grounded in logic and evidence. We encourage a truly scientific inquiry into politics that informs a critical discussion of political institutions and a rigorous approach to effecting positive political change. We offer courses in political theory, quantitative and formal political analysis, American politics, comparative politics, and international politics. Our curriculum covers a wide range of substantive topics including law, elections, ethnic conflict, justice, economic development, political account - ability, war and peacekeeping, public policy, democracy, political economy, strategy, and political attitudes and beliefs. Our faculty specializes in the politics of the United States and countries around the globe. Courses are regularly offered on Latin America, Western and Eastern Europe, Africa, Russia, India, China, and Japan. The analytical skills gained by politics majors prepare them for a wide range of careers. Our graduates accept positions with governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), think tanks, international finance groups, multinational corporations, law firms, and other institutions. Many pursue further study in fields such as political science, law, and public and international affairs at highly competitive universities. n Professors Emeriti Kazemi, Mitchell, Przeworski, Randall, Schain Bernhardt Denmark Chair of International Relations; Professor of Politics Smith Silver Professors; Professors of PasquinoAssociated Jost, King, Kane, Light, RubinFACULTYMajor in Politics The major requires ten 4-point courses (40 points) in the department, chosen in consultation with a departmental adviser and completed with a grade of C or better (Pass/Fail does not count). At least two of these courses must be chosen from the department's four designated core courses, both to be taken in the College: Political Theory (POL-UA 100) Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300) Comparative Politics (POL-UA 500) International Politics (POL-UA 700) Because the four core courses serve as prerequisites to many upper-level politics courses, majors are advised to take core courses early in their program of study. In addition, at least one course must be taken in three of the department's five fields: Political Theory American Government and Politics Comparative Politics International Politics Analytical Politics Although it is not required for the major, Introduction to Research Methods for Politics (POL-UA 850) is strongly recommended. Students are advised to take it before enrolling in other advanced courses in the major. Policies Applying to the Major No more than five courses (20 credits) can be accepted as transfer credit toward the major. NYU study away courses, as well as Advanced Placement (AP) and other advanced standing credit by examination, are treated as transfer credit for all students. Students may count eight points (the equivalent of two courses) from Advanced Placement (Comparative and U.S.), International Baccalaureate (Global Politics), or Advanced (A) Level (Government and Politics) examinations towards the requirements of the major. Up to eight points from other advanced standing examinations may be accepted after consultation with the department. None of these credits can substitute for any specific course or requirement in the major (such as one of the core requirements); they simply count as generic POL-UA credit toward the major. No more than three NYU study away courses (12 credits) may count toward the major. Internships in Politics and Government I, II (POL-UA 970, 971) and Readings and Research (POL-UA 990) do not count toward the major. Track in American Political Practice and Leadership This track (open only to declared politics majors) offers students the opportunity to gain skills and experience in applied American politics via a study away semester at NYU's site in Washington, D.C., while also acquiring the analytical understanding provided by American politics courses offered at NYU Washington Square. The requirements for the track are: Power and Politics in America (POL-UA 300) at the Washington Square campus 423 PROGRAM Politics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 424 A semester-long internship with a domestic policy focus (in government, politics, or a non-profit), plus Internship Seminar and Fieldwork (NODEP-UA 9982), both at the Washington, D.C. campus. These are the only internship credits allowed to count toward the politics major. Three upper-division courses in American politics. At least one must be taken at NYU Washington, D.C. and at least one at the Washington Square campus, and least one must be in a sub-field related to the student's internship.

Minor in Politics The minor requires five 4-point courses (20 points) in the department, chosen in consultation with departmental advisers and completed with a grade of C or better. A minor program may reflect a special emphasis in one of the department's five fields, or a subfield of the student's choosing. No special emphasis on a particular subfield is required for the minor, nor is a choice of subfield reflected on a student's academic record or transcript. Only NYU courses with a POL-UA number not also counted toward another major or minor can be counted toward the politics minor. At least three of the five courses for the minor must be taken at the Washington Square campus. As per CAS policy, no more than two courses of the five may be transfer courses. Students may count four points (the equivalent of one course) from Advanced Placement (Comparative or U.S.), International Baccalaureate (Global Politics), or Advanced (A) Level (Government and Politics) examinations towards the requirements of the minor. Up to four points from other advanced standing examinations may be accepted after consultation with the department. None of these credits can substitute for any specific course or requirement in the department (such as one of the core requirements); they simply count as generic POL-UA credit toward the minor. Honors Program For admission to and completion of the department's honors program, students must have a GPA of 3.65 both overall and in the politics major. The deadline for applying to the honors program is March 1 in spring of junior year. To be eligible for application students must have completed, or be currently enrolled in, either Quantitative Methods in Political Science (POL-UA 800) or Introduction to Research Methods for Politics (POL-UA 850), as well as either Introduction to Macroeconomics (ECON-UA 1) or Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2).

Politics / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF Psychology Chair of the Department Professor Rehder Associate Chair of the Department Associate Professor Rhodes (Interim) Director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Ma (Interim)as.nyu.edu/psychology 6 Washington Place, Room 423 New York, NY 10003-6634 212-998-7920Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Hilford Cognition and Perception Program Coordinator Professor Landy Social Program Coordinator Professor Trope Psychology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 433 OVERVIEWThe Department of Psychology at NYU approaches the study of mind and behavior from many perspectives. Cognitive psychologists focus on perception, memory, attention, language, and thinking. Social and personality psychologists determine how social beliefs, attitudes, and decisions are formed and maintained. Cognitive neuroscientists study features and functions in the brain as they relate to certain mental processes. Developmental psychologists seek to understand factors that affect and influence individuals across various ages. These many perspectives are reflected in undergraduate course offerings, all of which emphasize the scientific basis of psychology. In addition to its course offerings, the department encourages advanced undergraduates to become involved in faculty research through the Research Experiences and Methods course and the honors program. Highly qualified students are admitted to the honors program in their sophomore or junior year, take honors seminars, participate in primary research, and write an honors research thesis under close faculty supervision. NYU psychology majors graduate with an excellent academic foundation in psychology and are well-prepared for graduate study in the field. Graduates are accepted by top programs throughout the country. Others go on to careers in law, business, medicine, and education. n Professors Emeriti Aaronson, Chaiken, Glanzer, Goldberger, Sarnoff, Vitz Silver Psychology and Neural Science HeegerCollegiate Professor; Professor of Psychology and Bavel, West, Westerman, Winawer Assistant Professors Craig, Dillon, Hartley, Lake Clinical Assistant Professors Bauer, Reed, WallischAssociated Faculty Block, Voelbel, Y oshikawaFACULTYAdvanced Placement in Psychology and Statistics Entering students with a score of 4 or 5 on the AP exam in psychology receive credit for Introduc - tion to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1) and may count it as one of the ten courses required for the major. The same policy applies to students with International Baccalaureate credit (a score of 6 or 7, HL only) or A-Level credit (a grade of B or higher) in psychology. Entering students with a score of 4 or 5 on the AP exam in statistics receive credit for Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) and may count this as one of the ten courses required for the major. Major in Psychology Ten 4-point courses (40 points), completed with a grade of C or higher, are required: Introduction to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1) Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) Advanced Psychological Statistics (PSYCH-UA 11) Two courses from Core A (psychology as a natural science) Two courses from Core B (psychology as a social science) One laboratory course from Core C Two advanced electives General Policies Applying to the Major To declare a major in psychology, students must first earn a grade of C or better in both Introduc - tion to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1) and Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10). Developmental Psychology (PSYCH-UA 34) and Social Neuroscience (PSYCH-UA 35) can be selected by a student to count as either a Core A or Core B requirement (but not both). Credit toward the major is not granted for courses completed with a grade of less than C, or for courses taken on a Pass/Fail basis. General Recommendations Introduction to Psychology (PSYCH-UA 1) is taken first, preferably in the freshman year. Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10) should be taken next, as it lays the methodological groundwork for the research discussed in core courses; it must be among the first four psychology courses taken. The department advises students to take the required course Advanced Psycho - logical Statistics (PSYCH-UA 11) directly after Statistics for the Behavioral Sciences (PSYCH-UA 10). Core A and B courses of greatest interest to the student should be taken as soon as possible as preparation for the related Core C laboratory course. Advanced electives would typically be taken last. It is advised that students complete Core C before taking advanced courses, preferably by the spring of the junior year. Students interested in graduate training in psychology should become involved in research. Research Experience in Psychology (PSYCH-UA 996) offers the opportunity to participate in faculty research, providing a supervised research experience as well as training in research presentation and criticism. This course can help students in deciding about career directions and can result in a faculty letter of recommendation for graduate school applications. Pursuing an interest in clinical psychology: Students interested in graduate work in clinical psychology should consider some combination of Personality (PSYCH-UA 30), Practicum in 434 PROGRAM Psychology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 435 Clinical Psychology Research (PSYCH-UA 43) or Abnormal Psychology (PSYCH-UA 51), and Clinical Psychology (PSYCH-UA 81) among their course selections. Developmental Psychology (PSYCH-UA 34) is also an appropriate choice. The department provides special advisement for these students; contact the undergraduate program office for details. Pursuing an interest in experimental psychology or industrial and organizational psychology: If a student plans to pursue a research career (particularly in Core A areas), then in addition to the relevant courses in the major, courses in mathematics, chemistry, biology, physics, and computer science may be beneficial. If a career in business or organizational psychology is the goal, then in addition to Social Psychology (PSYCH-UA 32), Laboratory in Social and Organizational Psychology (PSYCH-UA 38), and Industrial and Organizational Psychology (PSYCH-UA 62) courses in economics, sociology, and mathematics may be useful. Joint Major in Language and Mind This major, intended as an introduction to cognitive science, is administered by the Departments of Linguistics, Philosophy, and Psychology.

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, prepares students to play roles in the creation, implementation, and evaluation of policies that address the challenges faced by domestic and global publics in the 21st century. Students in the major acquire critical conceptual, analytical, and quantitative skills related to the policy making process and learn how to ethically apply these skills in the assessment of alternative policy responses to a broad range of public issues. Grounded in the principles of social science, the major is particularly appropriate for students who are both passionate about policy problems and dedicated to reaching solutions to these problems through the use of logic and evidence. The public policy major prepares students for careers in government, the non-profit sector, research, and other fields involved in the creation, implementation, and evaluation of public policies. n Major The major in public policy requires one prerequisite and ten courses (eleven courses/44 points total) as listed below. The CAS prerequisite must be completed with a grade of C or better before a student can declare the major. One prerequisite course (4 points) that provides students with the strong analytic framework necessary to enter the major: Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2); advanced standing credit (AP, IB, etc.) in microeconomics is accepted. Three required core courses (12 points) in economics, policymaking, and quantitative and qualitative analysis that introduce students to the key questions and tools involved in the study of public policy (note that UPADM-GP 101, 111, and 140 count as 12 of the 16 credits CAS students are allowed to take outside the College, and any additional Wagner courses will also count against the 16 points. In addition, note that no Wagner courses can count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students to the College are required to complete in CAS -UA courses):Professor Bertelli Associate Professor S. ChanClinical Assistant Professors Kleiman, Sinclair FACULTY 442 The Politics of Public Policy (Wagner, UPADM-GP 101) Quantitative Analysis for Public Policy (Wagner, UPADM-GP 111); there are no substitutions for or exemptions from this statistics requirement. This course satisfies the College Core Curriculum Quantitative Reasoning requirement for public policy majors only. Other students cannot use the course to satisfy this Core requirement (no exceptions). The Economics of Public Policy (Wagner, UPADM-GP 140) One course in ethics and justice (4 points), drawn from the following list (students must check the economics, philosophy, and politics sections of this Bulletin for prerequisites of CAS options): Ethics and Economics (ECON-UA 207) Ethics and Society (PHIL-UA 3) Ethics (PHIL-UA 40) Medical Ethics (PHIL-UA 50) Topics in Ethics and Political Philosophy: Equality (PHIL-UA 102) Ethics, Politics, and Public Policy (POL-UA 130) Normative Issues in Public Policy (Wagner, UPADM-GP 120) Five electives (20 points). Public policy majors select five elective courses to deepen their understanding of, and expertise in, key policy areas. Two electives must be chosen from a list of pre-approved HIST-UA courses. At least one of the five courses must be in the policy analysis field. One elective may be an internship, to be chosen only from Internship Seminar (NODEP-UA 981) and Internship Seminar and Fieldwork (NODEP-UA 9982). For information on and application to NODEP-UA 9982, please consult with the College of Arts and Science Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160). The current list of approved electives in the fields of economics, environmental studies, politics, sociology, etc. is available at wagner.nyu.edu/undergrad . Although students are not required to focus on any particular field, examples of the kinds of fields into which many elective offerings fall include environmental policy; ethics and policy; finance and economic policy; health policy; international development; law and policy; manage - ment and policy; politics and policy; social policy; and urban policy. A senior seminar (PUBPL-UA 800, 4 points) in which students conduct in-depth analysis of a critical and relevant policy issue in a small classroom setting under the guidance of a faculty member from CAS or Wagner. Students apply the analytical methods and substantive knowledge of the policy process they have gained to a current policy problem of their choosing. Each student writes a senior seminar paper that consists of both policy analysis and recommendations for action. Policies Applying to the Major Credit toward the major is not given for courses completed with a grade of less than C, or for courses taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Students in this major may double-count up to two courses towards this major and another major. However, the department of the second major may allow more limited (or no) double-counting; therefore, students must always check with advisers in their second major. CAS students are allowed to take 16 credits in non-liberal arts courses in the other schools of the University; the three required Wagner courses for this major count as 12 of those 16 credits, and any additional Wagner courses will also count against the 16 points. Students with a good aca - Public Policy / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 443 demic reason for going over the 16-point limit must consult the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130) for permission. In addition, no Wagner courses can count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students to the College are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. Advisement and Declaration To declare the major, students should contact NYU Wagner (295 Lafayette Street, 2d Floor; 212-998-7400; wagner.undergraduate@nyu.edu ) to obtain and fill out the major declaration form. Students cannot declare the major until they have completed the prerequisite course with a grade of C or better. Once declared as public policy majors, students will be assigned to a faculty adviser for guidance on completion of public policy requirements and clearance for registration. Recommended Sequencing of Courses First Year: Introduction to Microeconomics (ECON-UA 2), if no advanced standing credit Politics of Public Policy (UPADM-GP 101), offered every semester Second Year: Quantitative Analysis for Public Policy (UPADM-GP 111), offered in the fall The Economics of Public Policy (UPADM-GP 140), offered in the spring Minors There are three cross-school minors for students interested in public policy. One, called public policy analysis, closely mirrors the core of the public policy major and is offered jointly by Wagner and CAS. The two others are the minors in social and public policy (offered by Wagner and CAS) and in public policy and management (offered by Wagner and Stern). For information on these three minors, please see the cross-school minors section of this Bulletin. Honors Program To graduate with honors in the public policy major, a student must maintain at least a 3.65 average in the ten courses required for the major (the prerequisite course is not calculated in this GPA), earn at least a 3.65 overall GPA, and write an honors thesis in the spring of senior year. At the end of the junior year, each honors student meets with a faculty director for initial advise - ment and approval. A student writes the honors thesis by enrolling in the Senior Seminar (PUBPL-UA 800, described above) and then enrolling in an additional thesis-writing independent study (PUBPL-UA 801, 4 points). This independent study is an additional eleventh course that does not count toward the ten required for the major proper, and is supervised by a faculty member whose area of academic expertise coincides with the focus of the honors thesis. To be awarded honors, a student must complete this two-course sequence (PUBPL-UA 800, 801) and produce a quality senior thesis. Study Away Students should discuss with an adviser for the major as early as possible. NYU Washington, D.C. is an excellent choice for many public policy majors.

They also approach the study of \"religion\" as a concept, which has itself been an intellectual object of inquiry and has played a key role in the development of the social and human sciences. Second, students learn empirically about religion in different times and places, either through historical or ethnographic study, using textual, visual, and audio sources. Third, students use religions, approached as lived practices, as a lens for examining other realms in social life, such as gender and sexuality, race, the nation-state, violence, memory, ethics, emo - tions, politics, economy, power, art, literature, and media. These realms, in turn, have an impact on religions. The Department of Religious Studies is closely affiliated with the Center for Religion and Media. It should be stressed that the department is oriented toward the academic analysis of religious phenomena and does not promote or endorse either religious belief itself or the views and practices of any particular religious tradition. n Major The major in religious studies requires eight 4-point courses (32 points) completed with a grade of C or better (courses graded Pass/Fail do not count), which must include both of the following: Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (RELST-UA 1, offered only in the fall semester) Advanced Seminar: Comparative Topics in the Study of Religion (RELST-UA 15, usually offered only in the spring semester) Majors are expected to outline completion of core requirements and design a coherent plan of study (which may, with permission, include courses outside the religious studies curriculum) in Professors Becker, de Vries Associate Professors Reed, Zito Assistant Professor OliphantAssociated Faculty Alatas, Bedos-Rezak, Browning, VitzFACULTY 447 consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Minor The minor in religious studies requires four 4-point courses (16 points) completed with a grade of C or better (courses graded Pass/Fail do not count), which must include Theories and Methods in the Study of Religion (RELST-UA 1, offered only in the fall semester). Honors Program Eligibility: Students must spend at least two full years in residence at the College of Arts and Science, completing at least 64 points of graded work in the College.

In the High Middle Ages and the Renaissance, they developed and evolved into languages that we recognize as the basis of (among others) modern Italian, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. The great works of literature produced in these centuries became the foundation of the national literatures of their respective cultures. The nine-course major in Romance languages in the College of Arts and Science is administered by the Departments of Italian, French, and Spanish and Portuguese. Students choose a combination of any two of these four languages, taking five courses in one and four in the other. Thus, majors in Romance languages are able to take advantage of the rich course offerings and resources of our world-renowned language departments and to learn from distinguished scholars in two fields. The major stresses competence in speaking and writing before moving into literary and cultural coursework. To improve students' facility with their two languages and promote cross-cultural understanding and exposure, study away at NYU Buenos Aires, Florence, Madrid, and Paris is encouraged. While they are at the Washington Square campus, students can take advantage of talks, exhibitions, films, and other events sponsored by the Departments of French, Italian, and Spanish and Portuguese and NYU's Maison Fran\u00e7aise, Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marim\u00f2, and King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center, as well as by cultural institutions in New York. A major in Romance languages is applicable to careers in international law and business, communications, education, fine arts, tourism, and diplomacy, and also complements majors in such fields as art history, cinema studies, comparative literature, history, international relations, linguistics, medieval and Renaissance studies, and music. n Overview of the Major The Romance languages major requires a total of nine 4-point courses (36 points) distributed between two languages, with five courses (20 points) taken in the primary language and four courses (16 points) taken in the secondary language. The combinations of primary-secondary languages are:PROGRAMRomance Languages / NYU College of Arts & and advisement in the major, students must visit the departments of both languages they intend to study. They must indicate to both departments which language is primary and which is secondary. Advisement for course sequencing takes place in the relevant departments. Students must earn a C or better in all courses for the major. Courses graded Pass/Fail cannot be counted toward the major. Below are listed the requirements for each of the four languages available in this major. French as Primary Language Five required courses (20 points): Written Contemporary French (FREN-UA 105) One of the following: Spoken Contemporary French (FREN-UA 101) French Phonetics (FREN-UA 103) Translation (FREN-UA 107) Advanced Techniques of Translation (FREN-UA 108) Acting French (FREN-UA 109) Business French (FREN-UA 110) One of the following: Approaches to French Literature (FREN-UA 140) Approaches to Francophone Literature (FREN-UA 145) French Society and Culture from the Middle Ages to 1900 (FREN-UA 163) Contemporary France (FREN-UA 164) Two advanced courses in French literature or linguistics, selected in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of French. For French as the secondary language, subtract one of the two advanced courses.

For Italian as the secondary language, subtract the one advanced course. Portuguese as Primary Language Requires five courses (20 points) beyond the level of Intermediate Portuguese II (PORT-UA 4), including courses taken in English with writing assignments completed in Portuguese, approved by the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. For Portuguese as the secondary language, subtract one of these five advanced courses. Spanish as Primary Language The prerequisite for all Spanish courses in the Romance languages major is either Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100) or Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speaking Students (SPAN-UA 51, formerly 111). Note that neither course counts toward the major. Students must take five upper-level courses taught in Spanish (20 points), chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese. One of the five may be an advanced language elective (creative writing, conversation, or translation). For Spanish as the secondary language, subtract one of these five upper-level courses. Honors in Romance Languages To be eligible, a student must spend a minimum of three full semesters in residence at the College of Arts and Science (attendance at NYU Buenos Aires, Florence, Madrid, or Paris counts toward this residence). The student must maintain a cumulative and major GPA of at least 3.65. A Romance languages major who meets these requirements and wishes to pursue a senior honors project should apply to the director of undergraduate studies in the language department of his or her intended faculty adviser.

The College Core Curriculum's Cultures and Contexts course on Russia (when offered) can count toward the major with permission from the director of undergraduate studies. Other Core courses taught by faculty in the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies may be accepted, under certain conditions, toward the undergraduate major or minor. Consult the director of undergraduate studies. Majors can take up to two graduate courses offered by the department with permission from both the director of undergraduate studies and the course instructor. All Russian majors are strongly encouraged to spend a semester or summer in Russia. Students with an overall GPA of 3.65 or above and a departmental GPA of 3.65 or above are urged to participate in the departmental honors program. (See \"honors program\" below.) Minor The prerequisite for declaring the minor in Russian and Slavic studies is proficiency in Russian or Czech above the Elementary II level. The minor comprises four 4-point courses (16 points) completed with a C or better; Russian Grammar and Composition I and II, and Elementary and Intermediate Russian I and II, do not count toward the minor. At least 8 points out of the required 16 must be earned by taking courses offered by the Department of Russian and Slavic Studies on culture, literature, or language above the level of Intermediate Russian II or Russian Grammar and Composition II. Up to two courses on topics pertaining to Russian and Slavic studies can be taken in other departments and programs, with departmental permission.

Russian and Slavic Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22MINOR IN Science and Society Director Professor Appuhn, Faculty of Arts and Science Steering Committee Professor Appuhn, Faculty of Arts and Science Professor Bain, Tandonnyu.edu/cross-school-minors 212-998-816 Assistant Professor d'Avignon, Faculty of Arts and Science Professor Geroulanos, Faculty of Arts and Science Associate Professor Mills, Steinhardt Science and Society / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 461 OVERVIEWScience and society is a rich, inherently cross-disciplinary minor, drawing on the course offerings and faculty expertise of the College of Arts and Science, the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, and the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. The minor analyzes how the techniques and methodologies of the humanities and social sciences can be used to illuminate both the context and content of science, technology, and medicine. Drawing upon history, philosophy, anthropology, and sociology, students investigate how culture and society frame\u2014and, indeed, are themselves framed by\u2014science, technology, and medicine. The current influence of scientific, technological, and medical issues on our lives is unprecedented, altering our notions of race, health, responsibility, ownership, ethics, aesthetics, and self. We are therefore obliged to understand these critical interactions with a view to understand, and intervene in, the world. The types of questions this minor poses include: How has gene patenting affected both the content and conduct of molecular biology, as well as intellectual property law? What is the relationship between the mathematical descriptions that physicists employ and the nature of physical phenomena? What are the ethical and political issues involved in human embry - onic stem cell research? How do machines shape aesthetics? What, if anything, is the difference between a machine and a human? How does nature have a history? This minor serves as an enlightening complement to pre-health studies, pre-law studies relevant to intellectual property, biotechnology, and environmental and healthcare studies. It also provides a potent training to those interested in pursuing advanced degrees in the history, philosophy, sociology, or anthropology of science, technology, or medicine. n Minor The minor in science and society requires four 4-point courses (16 points) completed with a grade of C or better (Pass/Fail does not count). All students must take the core course, Introduction to Science and Society (HIST-UA 66), and then choose three other courses from an approved list posted on the minor website. Many courses in the minor fall into one of the following four clusters: technology, physics, biology/ prehealth, and environmental sciences. Students are strongly encouraged, however, to be creative PROGRAM 462 and challenge themselves to think in ways other than those that are strictly categorical. For example, a student interested in understanding the difference between the natural and the artificial might take the following three elective courses in addition to the required Introduction to Science and Society course: Philosophy of Biology; Humans, Machines, and Aesthetics; and Nature and Technology in Modern America. Students are strongly encouraged to take courses in the various NYU schools contributing to the minor. This will expose them to a plethora of diverse pedagogical experiences and greatly enhance co-learning. All CAS students may apply 16 points taken in the other schools of NYU toward their degree. Students seeking to raise this limit so as to accommodate the course work of the minor in science and society must file a petition in the College of Arts and Science Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Note that, with the exception of the Graduate School of Arts and Science, courses taken in the other schools of NYU do not count toward the 64-point residency requirement in CAS (-UA) courses for internal and external transfers to the College. COURSES Core Course Introduction to Science and Society HIST-UA 66 Formerly HIST-UA 94. Required for the minor. Offered in the fall. Appuhn. 4 points. Provides a background to the plethora of techniques proffered by the human - ities and social sciences in studying the history of science, technology, and medicine. Topics include: Christian Aristotelianism, the rise of experimenta - tion and the Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment science, Darwin's theory of evolution and the church, eugenics in 20th-century America, machines and humans during the 19th and 20th centuries, historical explanations of disease, gene patenting, race and genes, and the history of HIV/AIDS.

Science and Society / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 Self-Designed Honors Major Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 905 New York, NY 10003 212-998-8130 Self-Designed Honors Major / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 465 OVERVIEWStudents in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) can apply to craft and complete a self-designed honors major, rather than one of the existing majors in the College. This major enables a small number of very capable and highly motivated students to pursue a plan of study that brings together courses from more than one CAS department or program. During their sophomore year, students compose their academic plan for the major in consultation with their two faculty advisers for their self-designed program of study as well as with the associate director of interschool programs and the director of college honors, who serves as the director of undergraduate studies. By spring of the sophomore year, the plan of study must be submitted to and approved by the College's honors committee. The self-designed honors major differs from the individualized major that the Gallatin School offers in several ways: These two NYU schools have distinct admissions criteria, general education curricula, and other requirements. This CAS major serves students who can realize their interdisciplinary goals within CAS (except for the 16 credits of non-CAS courses that CAS already permits), whereas Gallatin students draw heavily on courses from several NYU schools. This CAS major is an honors major, which has prerequisites for entry (e.g., 3.75 GPA; students must maintain a 3.65 GPA to remain in the major) and entails a heavy commitment to honors- level work, including independent research under faculty supervision. Freshmen and sophomores in CAS who are considering the self-designed honors major should contact the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130) to schedule an initial advising appointment with the associate director of interschool programs. nDEPARTMENT OF Social and Cultural Analysis Chair of the Department Professor Morganas.nyu.edu/sca 20 Cooper Square, 4th Floor New York, NY 10003-7112 212-992-9650Director of Undergraduate Studies Associate Professor Dent Social and Cultural Analysis / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 466 OVERVIEW PROGRAMProfessors Emeriti Molotch, Pratt, Rosaldo, Stacey, Walkowitz Erich Maria Remarque Professor of Literature Harper Silver Professors Dinshaw, LivingstonUniversity Professor Professors Tu, ZaloomAssistant Professors Gonick, Lee Instructor HuiFACULTYThe Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA) is interdisciplinary in nature, integrating topics from the humanities with methodologies from the social sciences. SCA houses the programs in Africana studies, American studies, Asian/Pacific/American studies, gender and sexuality studies, Latino studies, and metropolitan studies. Students who major in social and cultural analysis choose courses from these program areas in SCA and create an individualized concentration. Students have the opportunity to combine cutting-edge scholarship with real world practice. The department's faculty and students explore the range of relationships between human collectivities on the one hand and institutions and structures of power on the other, taking into account how these relationships are affected by such modern global developments as intensified urbanization, increased transnational exchange, and proliferating diasporic populations. n Major The social and cultural analysis major requires nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better. Two introductory courses\u2014may be taken in either order: Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101) One of the following, linked to the student's area of focus (CORE-UA classes must be taught by SCA faculty): Cultures and Contexts: Contemporary Latino Cultures (CORE-UA 529) 467 Cultures and Contexts: The Black Atlantic Cultures and Contexts: Asian/Pacific/American Cultures (CORE-UA 539) Intersections: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in U.S. History (SCA-UA 230) Approaches to Gender and Sexuality Studies (SCA-UA 401) Approaches to Metropolitan Studies (SCA-UA 601) Six elective courses: Six designated social and cultural analysis electives, four of which must be taught by SCA faculty. SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program (SCA-UA 42) is no longer required, but is highly recommended and can count as an elective; one language course can count as an elective if taught by SCA faculty. One research course: Advanced Research Seminar (SCA-UA 90) Minor Five 4-point courses (20 points) completed with a grade of C or better are required for the minor in social and cultural analysis. Students must take Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101), plus four designated social and cultural analysis electives taught by SCA faculty. One language course can count as an elective if taught by SCA faculty. Language and Linguistic Competency The type of rigorous intercultural study promoted within the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis requires students to recognize the complex modes of communication at work both within and across different social groups. The department therefore strongly encourages its students to develop advanced skills in language and linguistics by any of the following means: taking elective courses in sociolinguistics; studying a language other than English beyond the minimum level required by the College of Arts and Science (especially one germane to the department's fields of study); pursuing community-based internship fieldwork necessitating the development and use of specific language skills; or undertaking study or research abroad in contexts entailing the exercise of key language or linguistic capabilities. Policy on Double Counting of Courses Majors may share (double count) two courses with a second major, with permission from the other department/program. Minors may share (double count) one course with a major or a second minor, with permission from the other department/program. Honors Program Majors who have completed 48 points of graded work in CAS and have a 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major) are encouraged to register for Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92) in the fall semester of their senior year. Upon successful completion of the seminar requirement, students will be eligible to register for Senior Honors Thesis (SCA-UA 93) in the spring. Information about the honors program can be found at sca.as.nyu.edu/object/sca.related.honors . Social and Cultural Analysis / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 468 Introductory Core Social and Cultural Analysis 101 SCA-UA 101 Offered every year. 4 points. Introduces theories, methods, and political trajectories central to the Department of Social and Cultural Analysis (SCA). SCA addresses how individuals and populations structure their worlds and navigate the resulting social, cultural, and political terrain. It privileges scholarly work with an intersectional approach, drawing on theoretical insights from such fields as social geography, feminism and queer studies, ethnic studies, urban and met - ropolitan studies, critical race theory, labor studies, and cultural studies. For the second introductory course required of SCA majors, consult the list under \"program of study\" (or the SCA website). Research Core Advanced Research Seminar SCA-UA 90 Prerequisite: Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101) or one the SCA-UA 601. Offered every semester. 4 points. Students write a 20-25 page research paper with a focus on a specific research method. Topics vary by semester; see Albert for details. Honors Program Senior Honors Seminar SCA-UA 92 Prerequisites: 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major); Social and Cultural Analysis 101 (SCA-UA 101); 601; and permission of the department. Offered every fall. 4 points. Senior Honors Thesis SCA-UA 93 Prerequisites: Senior Honors Seminar (SCA-UA 92), 3.65 GPA or higher (both overall and in the major), and permission of the department. Offered every spring. 4 points. SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program The 4-point internship program com - plements and enhances the formal course work of the SCA major. Students intern at agencies dealing with a range of issues pertaining to their major and take a corequisite seminar that enables them to focus the work experience in meaningful academic terms. The goals of the internship are threefold: (1) to allow students to apply the theory they have gained through course work, (2) to provide students with analytic tools, and (3) to assist students in exploring pro - fessional career paths. The internship is open to juniors and seniors and requires an application, an interview, and permis - sion of the director of internships. SCA Theory and Practice: The Internship Program SCA-UA 42 Requires ten hours a week of fieldwork. Offered every spring. 4 points. Independent Study Independent Study SCA-UA 197, 198 Prerequisite: permission of the program director.

Social and Cultural Analysis / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22DEPARTMENT OF Sociology Chair of the Department Professor England (Interim)as.nyu.edu/sociology 295 Lafayette Street New York, NY 10012-9605 212-998-8340Director of Undergraduate Studies Professor Goodwin Sociology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 471 OVERVIEWThe discipline of sociology and the sociology major at NYU examine how our individual lives are embedded in families, groups and social networks, neighborhoods and schools, and organizations and institutions. Sociologists focus on the ways in which our own biographies are influenced and constrained by broader social, political, and economic forces which can be very localized, but are increasingly global in scale. We study sociology to understand the social world and to create change that will make it a better place. It is a discipline that gives students the tools to think critically about public issues of the day and to analyze many different kinds of evidence about the world that surrounds us. It pushes students to see the world differently, and to look beyond individuals to see the ways in which power, inequality, and social hierarchies operate beneath the surface of everyday life. n Major in Sociology The sociology major consists of nine 4-point courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better, as follows: Introduction to Sociology (SOC-UA 1) Sociological Theory (SOC-UA 111) Research Methods (SOC-UA 301) Statistics for Social Research (SOC-UA 302).

Sociology / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22MINOR IN South Asian Studies Adviser Professor Luddenas.nyu.edu/history 53 Washington Square South, 4th Floor New York, NY 10012-1098 212-998-8600 South Asian Studies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 478 OVERVIEW PROGRAMThe minor in South Asian studies, which is administered by the Department of History, provides students with a broad comparative perspective on South Asia and the opportunity for greater concentration in a specific topic of interest or geographic locale. Students have many choices of courses and course combinations. They can choose, for example, to study a language and its literature, explore aspects of the colonial and postcolonial histories of South Asia, investigate the art and architecture of the region, explore contemporary political dynamics, analyze literary forms and cinema, or track the South Asian diaspora. The course of study encompasses a range of disciplines, including anthropology, art history, history, literature, political science, and two modern languages (Hindi and Urdu). Through a consortial exchange program with Columbia University, students may also study one of the region's many modern or classical languages. n Minor The minor in South Asian studies requires four 4-point courses (16 points) chosen in close consultation with the South Asian studies faculty adviser. Students must declare the minor and consult the adviser before completing their course requirements. Students can pursue three broad areas of concentration: Track A: Language and Literature This track provides students with a solid foundation in a modern Indian language. Students must complete a four-semester sequence in either Hindi or Urdu. These courses may also be used to satisfy the CAS foreign language requirement. Track B: History, Culture, and Politics This track fosters a broad interdisciplinary perspective on South Asia. All four courses must be non-language courses. Track C: Culture and Language Students must take two language courses at the intermediate level or advanced level, plus two non-language South Asian studies courses. The language courses may also be used to satisfy the CAS foreign language requirement. Policies Applying to the Minor All courses for the minor must be completed with a grade of C or better (Pass/Fail does not count). 478 478 479 One College Core Curriculum Cultures and Contexts course on South Asia may be counted toward the nonlanguage minor requirement (in tracks B and C). The South Asian studies faculty adviser determines the eligibility of courses taught by NYU South Asian faculty which are not currently on the minor course list. One course taken in a study away program can be counted, with the faculty adviser's approval, after examining the syllabus and other documents related to that course, which students must provide. For students who matriculate in CAS as freshmen, at least three of the four courses must be completed at NYU. Transfer students may be allowed to count up to two transfer courses toward the minor (upon review and approval of the faculty adviser); they must always complete two courses for the minor at NYU. With prior approval, one independent study course can count toward the minor. One course can automatically double count for the South Asian minor and another major/minor, and two courses can be considered by student petition. Other majors and minors may have stricter policies on double counting of courses; students must check with their other departments. The minor does not satisfy either Societies and the Social Sciences or Expressive Culture in the College Core Curriculum. COURSES This list is subject to change, and course offerings may vary by semester. Students should consult departmental websites and school Bulletins for course descriptions and prerequisites.

The department offers six majors (Spanish and Latin American literature and culture; Latin American and Caribbean studies; Iberian studies; Romance languages; Spanish and linguistics; and Luso-Brazilian language and literature), as well as minors in Spanish, Latin American and Caribbean studies, Iberian studies, creative writing in Spanish, and Luso-Brazilian language and literature. Highly qualified students may participate in the honors program, which culminates in the writing of a thesis during the student's senior year under the supervision of a faculty member. Internships are offered for credit with educational and cultural institutions throughout the city. Students are encouraged to study away at NYU Madrid and NYU Buenos Aires, where they may fulfill many major or minor requirements through site-specific classes and immersive experiences. In addition, the department collaborates on programs with the Residential Life Exploration Program's Spanish language floor for freshmen, and publishes the on-line undergraduate journal wp.nyu.edu/esferas . n Professors Emeriti Anderson, Pollin, Pratt, Regalado University Professor; Professor of Spanish and Portuguese Taylor Collegiate Professor; Professor of Spanish Language and Literature (Portuguese) Nine 4-point courses (36 points) in language, literature, and culture, conducted in Portuguese beyond the intermediate level and completed with a grade of C or better. Portuguese courses at the graduate level and related courses in other departments may be counted toward the major with the permission of the director of undergraduate studies. Minor in Luso-Brazilian Language and Literature (Portuguese) Five 4-point courses (20 points) beyond the intermediate level, completed with a grade of C or better. Portuguese courses at the graduate level may be counted toward the minor with the permission of the director of undergraduate studies. Policies Applying to All Spanish Majors Students interested in Spanish may complete one of five majors: Spanish and Latin American literatures and cultures; Latin American and Caribbean studies; Iberian studies; Romance languages; and Spanish and linguistics. Students must discuss and plan their program of study with the director of undergraduate studies (DUS). Courses must be completed with a grade of C or better. Transfer students must complete at least half of the major in residence at New York University. A revision of the majors and minors offered by the Department is currently under consideration, and any updates necessary will be added to the Bulletin and departmental website as and when approval has been received. Major in Spanish and Latin American Literatures and Cultures This major comprises nine 4-point courses (36 points) above the intermediate level, four of which are required (students may apply Advanced Placement Spanish Literature credits toward the major): Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50, formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100) or Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speaking Students (SPAN-UA 51, formerly 111) Critical Approaches to Textual and Cultural Analysis (SPAN-UA 200). As of fall 2020 this is no longer offered, and students should replace it with any 300-level course (i.e. any course numbered SPAN-UA 300 through SPAN-UA 399). The Iberian Atlantic (SPAN-UA 201, formerly 300) Cultural History of Latin America (SPAN-UA 205, formerly 305) or Cultural History of Spain (SPAN-UA 260, formerly 310) The remaining five courses are advanced electives in Spanish or Latin American cultural and literary studies. Students may replace two of these electives with advanced language electives. Students may take two courses in English with writing in Spanish. Major in Latin American and Caribbean Studies This interdisciplinary major requires nine courses (36 points) completed with a grade of C or better. It allows students to design a course of study drawing on the offerings of the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies and the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, as well as courses in other departments and programs across the University, including anthropology, art history, cinema studies, comparative literature, economics, history, performance studies, politics, sociology, and more. Individual programs of study are planned with and approved by the director of undergraduate studies. 482 PROGRAM Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 483 The required courses are as follows: The Iberian Atlantic (SPAN-UA 201, formerly 300) One introductory course on Latin America or the Caribbean chosen from: Cultural History of Latin America (SPAN-UA 205, formerly 305) Cultural History of the Luso-Brazilian world (PORT-UA 215) Cultures and Contexts: the Caribbean (CORE-UA 509) Cultures and Contexts: Latin America (CORE-UA 515) Seven electives pertinent to the study of Latin America and the Caribbean, chosen in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. In addition, students are required to demonstrate proficiency in two languages, chosen from: Spanish through the level of Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100) or Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speaking Students (SPAN-UA 51, formerly 111); Portuguese through the intensive elementary level; and indigenous and diasporic languages (including Quechua, Haitian Kreyol, Nahuatl, and/or Mixtec) through the full elementary level.

Major in Iberian Studies This major comprises nine 4-point courses (36 points) drawing on both offerings in this department and courses related to Spain and/or Portugal from the early modern period to the present offered in other programs or departments throughout the University, including anthropology, cinema studies, comparative literature, European studies, history, medieval and Renaissance studies, and religious studies. The prerequisite for entering the major is either Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100) or Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speaking Students (SPAN-UA 51, formerly 111). Note that neither course counts toward the major. The major requires two foundational courses and seven electives. The foundational courses are as follows: The Iberian Atlantic (SPAN-UA 201, formerly 300) Cultural History of Spain (SPAN-UA 260, formerly 310) Cultural History of the Luso-Brazilian world (PORT-UA 215) The seven electives must be pertinent to the study of Spain and/or Portugal and are drawn from departments across the University. Students may replace one advanced elective with one language course in Portuguese (PORT-UA 10, 11) or in another language of importance to the region, such as Catalan, Gallego, Basque/Euskara, Hebrew, Latin, and Arabic, or any advanced course in Portuguese. At least one of the seven courses must be offered at the 300 level, such as Spanish Cinema 1960 to the Present (SPAN-UA 364) or Medieval Spain in Modern Fiction (SPAN-UA 365). Major in Romance Languages See the Romance languages section of this Bulletin for details and requirements. The major comprises nine 4-point courses (36 points), with five courses taken in the primary language and four in the secondary. For declaration of and advice in the major, students must visit the departments of both languages they intend to study and indicate to each which language is primary and which is secondary. Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 484 Major in Spanish and Linguistics This joint major requires a total of ten 4-point courses (40 points). Students choose five 4-point advanced courses (20 points) in Spanish, in consultation with this department's director of undergraduate studies. They have the option of applying one advanced language elective (creative writing, conversation, or translation) course toward the major. The prerequisite for entering the major is either Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100) or Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speaking Students (SPAN-UA 51, formerly 111); note that neither course counts toward the major.

All students who wish to minor in Spanish must declare with the department and select courses in consultation with the director of undergraduate studies. Courses must be completed with a grade of C or better. Transfer students must complete at least half the courses for their minor (three courses for a five-course minor) in residence at NYU. Minor in Spanish A minor consists of five 4-point courses (20 points) above the intermediate level. The five courses must include Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100) or Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speaking Students (SPAN-UA 51, formerly 111) and either Critical Approaches to Textual and Cultural Analysis (SPAN-UA 200; no longer offered as of fall 2020) or any 300-level SPAN-UA course. The remaining three courses may include one advanced language elective; the others must be culture or literature courses. Minor in Latin American and Caribbean Studies The minor consists of five courses (20 points) on Latin America and the Caribbean, drawn from the Department of Spanish and Portuguese and/or other departments across the university. Students must take one introductory course chosen from Cultural History of Latin America (SPAN-UA 205, formerly 305), Cultures and Contexts: The Caribbean (CORE-UA 509), or Cultures and Contexts: Latin America (CORE-UA 515).

Note that Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100) does not count toward the minor; this course (or equivalent) is a prerequisite for entering the minor. Honors Program To qualify for the honors program in the department, students must maintain at least a 3.65 general average and a 3.65 major average; they must consult with the director of undergraduate studies in the second semester of their junior year. During their senior year, students register for the Senior Honors Seminar (SPAN-UA 498, formerly SPAN-UA 995) in the fall and then enroll in the Honors Thesis Seminar (SPAN-UA 499, formerly SPAN-UA 996) the following spring. The honors thesis is an extended research paper written on a topic of the student's choice and directed by a faculty adviser. The two-semester honors seminar sequence covers such areas as choosing a topic, compiling a bibliography, conducting library and web-based research, properly documenting sources, and developing research and writing methods for graduate- or profession - al-level study. Students give an oral presentation on the honors thesis and its bibliography. Spanish Language Program: Policy on Course Placement Students with no previous study of Spanish enroll in Spanish for Beginners I (SPAN-UA 1). Students with one year of high school Spanish may either enroll in SPAN-UA 1 or take a placement test. All other students must show proof of placement through one of the following: the SAT subject exam, or AP, IB, or A Level exam; or the NYU online placement exam. Students who know or have studied Spanish but do not take a placement test will not be allowed to stay in a course. Students with transfer credit in Spanish must take a placement test to register for the language in CAS; they cannot place themselves. Transfer credit at or above the intermediate two level satisfies Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 486 the Core graduation requirement, but is not used for placement. Native Spanish (heritage) speakers must take a special departmental evaluation (not the online placement exam or the usual written exemption exam) for placement into Intermediate Spanish for Spanish Speakers (SPAN-UA 11) or Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speakers (SPAN-UA 51, formerly 111). Completion of either course fulfills the language requirement. Placement test results are valid for 18 months. Students cannot take the test more than once every 18 months without the permission of the director of the language program. The results are not recommendations; students must register for the course they place into. Only a course coordinator or the director of the language program can override a placement test score. Placement results will be assessed by instructors in the first week of classes. Inappropriately placed students will be asked to drop/add into the correct level. Incoming freshmen must not take the NYU online placement exam while they are waiting for AP, IB, A Level, or SAT subject exam results. Standardized exam results take precedence over the online exam. (If the SAT Spanish exam was taken in junior year of high school, however, please take the NYU placement exam for a more recent assessment.) If standardized test results arrive and are too low to award credit, students must then take the NYU online placement exam. If more than 18 months have elapsed since a student took a SPAN-UA course (or a standardized test such as the AP, SAT II or IB), it can no longer serve as an automatic prerequisite for the next course in the sequence. The student must take or retake the NYU online placement examination to determine the correct level of study. This may result in repeating SPAN-UA courses and/or loss of credit. Advanced Placement (AP), International Baccalaureate (IB), A Level exams, and the SAT Subject Examination in Spanish may be used for placement in the proper level of study so long as the scores are no more than 18 months old. For more information and tables showing appropriate course placement for specific test scores, consult the section on language placement at the department's website, as.nyu.edu/spanish . To contact the director of the language program (DLP), call 212-998-8770 or write to spanish. dlp@nyu.edu . Spanish Language Program: Policy on Advanced Placement Students who score a 4 or 5 on the Spanish Language exam earn 4 credits for Intermediate Spanish II (SPAN-UA 4) and are exempt from the College's language requirement. If they wish to continue studying Spanish they can register for Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100), but on the first day of classes must take an in-class exam to finalize proper course placement. This may result in dropping to a lower level of Spanish and losing the AP credit. Students who obtain a score of 4 on the Spanish Literature exam receive 4 credits for Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100) and satisfy the Core language requirement. If they wish to continue taking Spanish classes, they must take a special, advanced language placement evaluation at the Spanish department (not the online placement or usual written exemption exam) and consult with the director of the Spanish language program. Students who obtain a score of 5 on the Spanish Literature exam either receive 4 credits for Advanced Spanish (SPAN-UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100), or (with approval of the director of the Spanish language program) for a higher-level course; Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 487 Course Numbering System Effective fall 2020, the department has extensively renumbered and reorganized many of its courses. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese above the intermediate level fall into the following categories: 50-level courses are bridge courses focusing on the acquisition of oral and written language skills that facilitate the transition from basic language courses to the major. 100-level courses are advanced lan - guage courses in which students can acquire specific skills in translation, creative writing, and professional vocabularies while they reinforce and deepen their knowledge and proficiency in Spanish and/or Portuguese. The 100 level also includes 2-point courses, independent study, and internships. 200-level courses are content courses that provide (a) historical foundations and frameworks for the study of Hispanic and Lusophone cultures; (b) critical, theoretical, and methodological tools for the study of cultural works; and (c) an emphasis on writing in the discipline. Some are taught in English. 300-level courses combine the acquisi - tion of critical and methodological skills with a writing-intensive component, offering students the opportunity to learn and practice critical skills and expand historical knowledge at the same time as they acquire proficiency in writing in the fields of Hispanic and Lusophone cultural and critical studies. These courses are taught only in Spanish or Portuguese. 400-level courses focus on critical debates and methodological skills applied to specific cultural artifacts or historical periods. These courses, some of which are taught in English, utilize research skills learned in previous courses and develop new ones; expand students' command of critical vocabular - ies and debates; and emphasize the presentation of research results in a variety of formats and genres, from research papers to journalistic reports and multimedia projects. This level also includes the honors seminar and thesis course for honors-track students. Placement in Spanish Language Courses For full details, students must consult the website of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, as well as the \"policy on course placement\" and \"policy on Advanced Placement (AP)\" (both under \"program\" in this department's section in this Bulletin). To enroll in one's first Spanish language course at NYU, students must have taken the SAT Subject Test in Spanish; have advanced standing credit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A Levels, or equivalent; or have taken the placement examination administered by the Univer - sity. The exception is students with no previous study of Spanish or who took no more than one year of Spanish in high school, who may enroll in Spanish for Beginners I (SPAN-UA 1). Students from a Spanish-speaking background who wish to study the language may not enroll in any level of Spanish for Beginners (SPAN-UA 1, SPAN-UA 2, and SPAN-UA 10) or Intermediate Spanish (SPAN-UA 3, SPAN-UA 4, and SPAN-UA 20), but must instead enroll in Spanish for Spanish Speakers (SPAN-UA 11) or Advanced Spanish for Spanish Speakers (SPAN-UA 51, formerly 111) after taking a special written placement test in the department. Students with transfer credit in Spanish must take a placement test if they intend to register for the language in CAS. Note that after 18 months, a completed SPAN-UA course no longer serves as a prerequisite for more advanced courses; students must take or retake the placement exam. In addition, test scores are valid for only 18 months. Admission to Courses above Intermediate Spanish Students who have completed Intermediate Spanish I and II (SPAN- UA 3 and SPAN-UA 4) or Intensive Intermediate Spanish (SPAN-UA 20) must take Advanced Spanish (SPAN- UA 50; formerly Advanced Grammar and Composition, SPAN-UA 100) as a prerequisite for upper-level courses, unless otherwise noted in course descriptions. 487 either way, they satisfy the Core language requirement. If they wish to continue taking Spanish classes, they must take a special advanced language placement evaluation at the Spanish department (not the online placement or usual written exemption exam) and consult with the director of the Spanish language program.

Spanish and Portuguese Languages and Literatures / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 Cross-School Minors nyu.edu/cross-school-minors Silver Center 100 Washington Square East, Room 901 New York, NY 10003 212-998-8160 Cross-School Minors / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 497 OVERVIEWCross-school minors offer students the opportunity to develop specializations in a number of non-liberal arts fields through structured coursework taken at other NYU schools. These minors, which are open to all students in the College of Arts and Science, are either partly or wholly composed of courses from participating schools, such as NYU's College of Global Public Health; Silver School of Social Work; Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development; Stern School of Business; Tisch School of the Arts; Tandon School of Engineering; and Wagner School of Public Service. Students interested in pursuing a cross-school minor are encouraged to view minor requirements and to contact a minor representative with any questions. Minor curricula and contact information can be found on the NYU cross-school minors website ( nyu.edu/cross-school-minors ). For additional advising support, CAS students can contact the associate director for interschool programs in the College, or schedule an appointment with the associate director through the College's Preprofessional Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160). With the exception of the cinema studies minor, all courses taken outside the College to complete cross-school minor requirements count toward the 16-point limit on course work in other NYU divisions. Since many of these minors require 16 points of coursework outside the College, students are strongly encouraged to develop their course of study in consultation with a CAS adviser. Courses taken within the College (with a -UA suffix) to complete cross-school minor requirements will not count toward the 16-point limit. Students seeking additional non-CAS credits above the 16-point limit must speak with their academic adviser in the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130). No courses taken in the other schools of NYU (whether for a cross-school minor or as electives) may count toward the 64 credits that internal or external transfer students to CAS are required to complete in CAS (-UA) courses. The minors offered by other NYU schools that are available to CAS students are listed on the NYU cross-school minors website (above). For further information about the business studies, child and adolescent mental health studies, cinema studies, law and society, and science and society minors, please consult the relevant sections of this Bulletin. Note that College of Arts and Science students may not declare a cross-school minor in a field of study that is offered in the College. n 497The prehealth program in the College of Arts and Science is appropriate for any student who plans to apply to allopathic or osteopathic medical, dental, veterinary, optometry, podiatry, or other health professional schools. To prepare for most four-year doctoral programs in the health professions, we recommend completion of the following courses: Principles of Biology I and II (BIOL-UA 11, BIOL-UA 12); Principles of Biology Lab - oratory (BIOL-UA 123), for students not majoring in biology; General Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 125); General Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 126); Organic Chemistry I and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 225); Organic Chemistry II and Laboratory (CHEM-UA 226); General Physics I and II (PHYS-UA 11, 12); Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1), plus one elective in English or expository writing; Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or its equiva - lent; and Biochemistry I (CHEM-UA 881). Preparation for specific entrance exams may warrant the completion of additional coursework in the social sciences, specifically in the areas of psycholo - gy and sociology. Some professional schools may recommend or require additional courses, such as statistics, genetics, anatomy, or microbiology. Applicants are responsible for research - ing the specific entrance requirements of their target schools. While prehealth students should strive to earn the best grades possible, they must also keep in mind that schools of the health professions evaluate every aspect of a candidate's background when making admission decisions. Therefore, students are encouraged to pursue a major of heartfelt interest, to participate in extracurricular activities of their choosing, and to develop intellectual pursuits and hobbies outside their schoolwork. Additionally, all prehealth students are very strongly encouraged to obtain work experience, whether as a paid employee or volunteer, in the area they would like to pursue. This practical experience allows students to make an intelligent and informed decision about whether or not they should pursue a career in the health professions. Admissions commit - tees expect applicants to understand and articulate the benefits and challenges of their chosen career, and to address their personal suitability for the vocation. The College's Preprofessional Advising Center (726 Broadway, 7th Floor; 212- 998-8160) has developed an extensive evaluation process that culminates in a letter generated by the Committee on Evaluations to Schools of the Health Professions. Students preparing to apply to schools of the health professions participate in the committee process during the academic year immediately preceding their summer application to schools of the health professions. Students are encouraged to keep in touch with Preprofessional Advising throughout their time at NYU so that they are aware of the procedures and deadlines for receiving a committee letter of evaluation. Applicants to schools of the health professions must have completed at least five of the required prehealth science courses while matriculated in an undergraduate degree program or our postbaccalau - reate prehealth studies program within the past ten (10) years at NYU in order to be eligible for a committee interview and letter from the CAS Preprofessional Advising Center. Students considering a career in the health professions are strongly urged to discuss their intentions with an academic adviser as early as possible. There is no prehealth major at the College, and the designation will not appear on a student's transcript. Stu - dents complete the relevant prehealth courses in tandem with their major, College Core Curriculum, and minor (if any) requirements, and it is this parallel structure that allows students to start or stop their prehealth coursework without impacting the completion of their degree. While the Preprofessional Advising Center is located in the College of Arts and Science, preprofessional advisors frequently work with students from other NYU undergraduate divisions who wish to follow the prehealth curriculum. Very detailed information about the undergraduate experience as a pre - health student, prerequisites for health professional schools, and the committee process is available on the Preprofes - sional Advising Center website, cas.nyu. edu/prehealth . Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs 498 THE ROBERT AND ELLEN SALANT PREHEALTH PROGRAM 499 499 B.A./D.D.S. Program The B.A./D.D.S. program is a seven-year joint program between the College of Arts and Science and the College of Dentistry at New York University. It is designed for students who are certain that they would like to pursue a career in dentistry. Admission requirements include a minimum high school GPA of 3.5 and combined SAT scores of at least 1370. Students are admitted to the program as incoming freshmen and engage in academic studies and cocurricular activities that will prepare them for the dental school curriculum. They spend the first three years of the program at the College of Arts and Science, where they complete the College Core Curric - ulum, the prehealth requirements, and an abbreviated biology major, for a total of 104 points. Students must maintain a minimum overall GPA of 3.2, as well as a major GPA of at least 3.4; in addition, grades of B or higher must be earned in all courses required for the abbrevi - ated biology major. Students are also expected to participate in the program's cocurricular activities, which are de - signed to enhance their understanding of the dental profession; these activities include special lectures, field trips, and cultural functions.During the fall of the third year, students in the B.A./D.D.S. program take the Dental Admission Test and make formal application to the College of Dentistry. Students enter the College of Dentistry in the fall of the fourth year and must maintain matriculation in the College of Arts and Science during their first year of dental school. For the B.A. degree to be awarded, an official copy of the first-year dental school transcript and a statement from the College of Dentistry indicating promotion to the second year of dental studies is forwarded to the associate dean for advising and student services in the College of Arts and Science's Office of the Dean. The NYU Postbaccalaureate Prehealth Studies Program is a certificate program that provides support to students inter - ested in pursuing a career in the health professions. The program is designed for career-changer students who have already earned a bachelor's degree, but have not yet taken some or all of the science courses required for admission to graduate study in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, physician assistant - ship, physical therapy, or other health professions. Students admitted to the postbacca - laureate program must have earned an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher. Students are only eligible for the post - baccalaureate program if they plan to complete at least half of the prehealth science curriculum at NYU. The postbac - calaureate curriculum is designed to be completed in two years, including summer courses, but completion time may vary depending on the student's prior academic background and the student's semester of entry into the program (e.g., fall or spring). The mini - mum time spent in our program is one academic year, and the maximum is three academic years. Postbaccalaureate students are fully integrated into NYU's community of undergraduates, attending courses alongside other students who are also committed to a prehealth education. They are taught by leading members of the Faculty of Arts and Science, who are known for their acces - sibility and student-centered teaching. CAS postbaccalaureate students have full access to NYU's staff of dedicated advisers located in the College's Prepro - fessional Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160). Postbacca - laureate students are also encouraged to attend the peer tutoring and group review sessions offered by the University Learning Center, which are free of cost.In addition to the successful completion of prehealth coursework, postbaccalau - reate students are expected to build a prehealth \"portfolio\" by pursuing clinical, research, and/or community volunteer opportunities outside the classroom to expand their knowledge of the health - care industry. Students are encouraged to search for health-related opportuni - ties, both on- and off-campus, through the weekly prehealth email newsletter and the Wasserman Center for Career Development. Prior to submitting applications to graduate health professional programs, postbaccalaureate students will participate in the application and interview process facilitated by the NYU Committee on Evaluations to Schools of the Health Professions. During this process, students are evaluated on their performance in the postbaccalaureate program in combina - tion with their extracurricular involve -ACCELERATED/JOINT PROGRAM IN PREHEALTH POSTBACCALAUREATE PREHEALTH PROGRAM Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 500 500 ment. The end result is an institutional letter of evaluation, which supplements their application to graduate health professional programs. Students who have successfully complet - ed the NYU postbaccalaureate program have been admitted to a variety of pres -tigious medical and dental programs, including NYU, Yale, Columbia, Cornell, Pittsburgh, SUNY, Mount Sinai, and Albert Einstein. Prospective students are invited to explore the program and review the NYU prehealth science curriculum at cas.nyu.edu/prehealth . Information sessions about the postbaccalaureate program are held throughout the year to give prospective students an opportunity to meet with program staff and current postbaccalaureate students in a group setting. Please contact postbacc@nyu. edu or call 212-998-8160 with questions. Joint B.S./B.S. Program in Engineering Since the fall of 2010, the College's dual degree program with the NYU Tandon (formerly Polytechnic) School of Engi - neering has offered highly qualified and motivated students who are technically oriented the opportunity to pursue both a liberal arts program with a major in sci - ence, mathematics, or computer science and a traditional engineering program. The College endorses the position of the Association of American Law Schools that a single \"best\" preparation for law school cannot be recommended. As such, there is no prescribed prelaw curriculum, so prelaw students are free to choose from the wide variety of courses offered at the College of Arts and Science. Purpose of Prelaw Study While the College does not require prelaw students to follow a specific academic curriculum, it does advise enrolling in courses that require exten - sive reading, research, and writing. The College Core Curriculum is excellent preparation for prelaw students, as it offers a rigorous and multidisciplinary foundation for advanced study in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. The honors programs offered by several departments provide oppor - tunities to complete substantial writing projects during the junior and senior years. No matter which major a student chooses, law schools value a well-round -ed liberal arts education, so students should select their electives wisely. For example, the precision of methodology and thought required of students in mathematics, computer science, logic, and the natural sciences will aid in the development of analytic skills, while a background in the behavioral sciences and the humanities (politics, economics, history, literature, philosophy, anthropol - ogy, and sociology) will offer a deeper understanding of human institutions and values, as well as opportunities for critical thinking and writing. Advising The staff of the College's Preprofession - al Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 901; 212-998-8160) can advise students on general course selection, participa - tion in clubs and organizations, law school applications, and related issues. The office serves as a clearinghouse for dean's certification forms, required by a number of law schools as part of their admissions process. The Lawyer Alumni Mentoring Program (LAMP) offers CAS sophomores, juniors, and seniors an opportunity to apply for one-on-one mentoring with experienced attorneys who are alumni of the College. Students should visit cas.nyu.edu/prelaw for more information. Other Prelaw-Related Activities The New York University School of Law, conveniently located across the Square from the College, sponsors many events open to the University community. The school's proximity allows prelaw students to observe first-year law school classes and to meet and speak informally with students actively pursuing legal studies. The College also sponsors talks by guest speakers on law-related topics and arranges for representatives from various law schools to visit the College for information. In addition, the Wasserman Center for Career Development co-hosts events and panels open to the university's prelaw community.BARBARA AND EVAN CHESLER PRELAW PROGRAM ACCELERATED AND JOINT OPTIONS LEADING TO GRADUATE OR SPECIALIZED DEGREES Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 501 501 The program is ideal for the student interested in science and engineering who is also eager for a liberal arts expe - rience before entering an undergraduate engineering environment. Upon comple - tion of this five-year program, students receive both a B.S. degree from the College of Arts and Science and a B.S. degree from the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. Students typically begin the program in the first semester of their first year. See the section on engineer - ing in this Bulletin for details. For more information, students may consult the academic adviser for the dual B.S./B.S. program in the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130) and visit cas.nyu.edu/engineering . Accelerated Bachelor's/ Master's Track with GSAS The College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS) offer students in many departments the opportunity to earn both the bachelor's and master's degrees in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case. Students may even be eligible to complete a master's degree in a department dif - ferent than that of their undergraduate major. Qualifying students are typically accepted towards the end of the sopho - more year or during the junior year. Students on the track must satisfy all requirements of both the bachelor's and master's degrees; there is no double-counting of courses. In order to complete the track in five years, students are required to complete at least a quarter of the graduate cred - its that are required for the master's degree before earning the bachelor's. This would mean at least eight graduate credits towards a 32-credit master's program, or at least nine towards a 36-credit program. There are a few notable exceptions: as few as eight credits can be earned towards the 40-credit politics M.A. program, while nine and twelve credits are required towards the 32-credit economics M.A. and the 32-credit museum studies M.A., respectively. Students can earn additional graduate credits towards the master's before they complete the bachelor's, as their schedule permits. Students in CAS and Global Liberal Studies (GLS) may apply to the track once they have completed a minimum of three semesters toward the bachelor's degree (at least one semester in CAS is also required for transfer students), and prior to their final two undergraduate terms. To be eligible, students must have a minimum of two terms remaining in CAS or GLS (excluding January term) during which they are still working towards completion of undergraduate requirements. Students must have a minimum cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 to apply and, if admitted, to transition into GSAS. Students must also satisfy any additional bachelor's/master's application prereq - uisite that may be set by their graduate program of interest. These may include a certain major GPA, declaration of the department's undergraduate major or minor, completion of specified course - work, a relevant internship experience, or a meeting with the program director prior to application. Students interested in applying should carefully review the participating departments page of the bachelor's/master's program website (cas.nyu.edu/bachmast ) to check for program-specific eligibility requirements. Bachelor's/master's students who satisfy track requirements as undergraduates receive a scholarship covering 50% of master's tuition and registration fees during the graduate school year. The scholarship is provided only after com - pletion of the bachelor's degree and upon matriculation into the Graduate School of Arts and Science (GSAS). It remains available for twelve months from the point of matriculation into GSAS, which is up to three consecutive terms. The bachelor's/master's schol - arship is available to all students in the track, including international students, and it does not require an additional application. Bachelor's/master's students are eligible for a 50% reimbursement for master's coursework that they took during a summer undergraduate term or in excess of 18 credits in a fall or spring under - graduate semester. This reimbursement is available during the GSAS year and it supplements the 50% reduction of tuition and fees for new master's course - work taken during that year. Beyond the 50% track scholarship, students may be eligible for additional forms of financial aid once they matriculate into GSAS. Application guidelines and a schedule of walk-in advising hours for this track are available on the bachelor's/master's track website ( cas.nyu.edu/bachmast ). Accelerated BA/MA track with Bioethics (CGPH) The College of Global Public Health (CGPH) offers CAS and GLS undergrad - uates the opportunity to complete a master's in bioethics in less time and at a reduced cost. Students on the track must satisfy all requirements of both the bachelor's and master's degrees; there is no double-counting of courses. In order to complete the track in five years, students are required to complete at least six of the graduate credits that are required for the bioethics master's degree before earning the bachelor's. Students in CAS and Global Liberal Studies (GLS) may apply to the track once they have completed a minimum of three semesters toward the bachelor's Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 502 degree (at least one semester in CAS is also required for transfer students), and prior to their final two undergraduate terms. To be eligible, students must have a minimum of two terms remaining in CAS or GLS (excluding January term) during which they are still working towards completion of undergraduate requirements. Students must have a minimum cumulative GPA of at least 3.0 to apply and, if admitted, to transition into bioethics. Bachelor's/master's students who satisfy track requirements as undergraduates receive a scholarship for 25% of master's tuition and registration fees during the graduate school year. The scholarship is provided only after completion of the bachelor's degree and upon matricula - tion into the bioethics master's program, and covers 26 credits' worth of tuition after matriculation. The bachelor's/ master's scholarship is available to all students in the track, including interna - tional students, and does not require an additional application. Beyond the 25% track scholarship, students may be eligible for additional forms of financial aid once they matriculate into bioethics. Application guidelines and a schedule of walk-in advising hours for this track are available on the bachelor's/master's track website ( cas.nyu.edu/bachmast ). Accelerated BA/MS track with Clinical Research (College of Dentistry) The College of Dentistry offers CAS undergraduates the opportunity to complete a master's in clinical research in less time and at a reduced cost. Students on the track must satisfy all requirements of both the bachelor's and master's degrees; there is no dou - ble-counting of courses. In order to complete the track in five years, stu - dents are required to complete at least six of the graduate credits that are re - quired for the clinical research master's degree before earning the bachelor's. Students in CAS may apply to the track once they have completed a minimum of three semesters toward the bachelor's degree (at least one semester in CAS is also required for transfer students), and prior to their final undergraduate term. To be eligible, students must have a minimum of one term remaining in CAS (excluding January term) during which they are still working towards completion of undergraduate require - ments. Students must have a minimum cumulative GPA of at least 3.3 to apply and, if admitted, to transition into clinical research. Application guidelines and a schedule of walk-in advising hours for this track are available on the bachelor's/master's track website ( cas.nyu.edu/bachmast ). Accelerated Bachelor's/ Master's Teacher Education Programs (CAS and Steinhardt) The College of Arts and Science (CAS) and the Steinhardt Department of Teaching and Learning offer dual degree programs that allow CAS students in selected majors to complete both their B.A. and an M.A. in teacher education from the Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. Students admitted to one of the B.A./ M.A. teacher education programs can, with careful planning, earn both degrees at less cost than is normally the case. These dual degree programs combine the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level. All programs qualify graduates for initial certification as a teacher in grades 7 through 12 in most states around the country.At this time, CAS and Steinhardt offer the following dual degree teacher education programs: B.A. in English/M.A. in teaching English, grades 7-12 B.A. in history/M.A. in teaching history, grades 7-12 B.A. in mathematics/M.A. in teaching mathematics, grades 7-12 Students admitted to a bachelor's/ master's teacher education track complete graduate credits in teacher education as regular electives during their junior or senior years. Students may view required courses for their particular track by visiting Steinhardt's accelerated B.A./M.A. teacher educa - tion program website ( edu/teachlearn/dual ) and may receive additional guidance graduate student advisors (Nathan Tovar, teachlearn. gradadvise@nyu.edu ). Designated track courses may count toward both the B.A. and M.A. degrees. After graduation and pending admission to Steinhardt, students who have completed the teach - er education track as undergraduates can finish the remaining credits required for the M.A. degree in one additional year of study. The application process for matriculat - ed CAS students consists of two parts. Students first apply to the teacher edu - cation track in their major. To be eligible for consideration and admission to the track, a student must have an approved major (see above) and a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0. Students may apply to the track once they have completed a minimum of three semesters toward the bachelor's degree (at least one semes - ter in CAS is also required for transfer students), and prior to their final two undergraduate semesters. For formal ad - mission to Steinhardt, CAS seniors must also submit the Steinhardt graduate ap - plication prior to graduating from CAS. 502 Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 503 503 Admission to the teacher education track does not guarantee admission to Steinhardt. Application guidelines and a schedule of walk-in advising hours for this program are available on the bachelor's/ master's program website ( cas.nyu.edu/ bachmast ). Accelerated B.A./M.P.A. and B.A./M.U.P. Programs (CAS and Wagner) New York University offers College of Arts and Science students the op - portunity to use their undergraduate coursework to reduce the number of credits needed to complete a Master of Public Administration (M.P.A.) or Master of Urban Planning (M.U.P.) from the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. Students admitted to the B.A./M.P.A. or B.A./M.U.P. program can, with careful planning, earn their graduate degree in a shortened time and at less cost than normal. This program combines the benefits of a broad liberal arts education at the undergraduate level with a professional education at the graduate level. CAS undergraduates in most but not all majors may apply to the B.A./M.P.A. track (consult the website below for details). Students choose between two programs in Wagner\u2014either public and nonprofit policy and management, or health policy and management\u2014and then further specialize within either program. CAS undergraduates in any one of eight approved majors are eligible to apply to the B.A./M.U.P. track; the majors are economics, environmental studies, international relations, metropolitan studies, politics, public policy, sociolo - gy, and urban design and architecture. Students select an area of specialization within the urban planning program. Bachelor's-master's student reduce their eventual master's credit requirements in one of two ways: 1. Complete undergraduate courses that will grant them a waiver for specific Wagner Core coursework (and the accompanying degree credits). Please consult cas.nyu.edu/bachmast/ wagner for a full list of pre-approved equivalencies. 2. Complete Wagner graduate course - work while still an undergraduate, and double-count these creditsbetween their undergraduate and graduate degree requirements. Wagner graduate courses are selected in consultation with the assistant director of advisement and student services in Wagner. Participating students are able to use their undergraduate coursework to waive or complete a total of 21 of the 45 points required for the M.P.A. or M.U.P. Admission to the B.A./M.P.A. or B.A./ M.U.P. track is open to CAS students who have completed at least three semesters in the College with a cumu - lative GPA of 3.0 or higher (at least one semester in CAS is required for transfer students). For formal admission to Wagner, CAS seniors must also submit the Wagner graduate application prior to graduating from CAS; admission to the B.A./M.P.A. or B.A./M.U.P. track does not guarantee admission to Wagner. Application guidelines and a schedule of walk-in advising hours for this pro - gram are available on the bachelor's/ master's program website ( cas.nyu.edu/ bachmast ). INTERNSHIPS One defining characteristic of the New York University educational experience is the opportunity students have to apply their classroom learning to real-life experiences in a variety of professional and community-service settings. New York City provides such opportunities in abundance, and the College of Arts and Science and the University take full ad - vantage of our location in the financial, cultural, scientific, and media capital of the world. Our alumni base, for example, encompasses every conceivable profes - sion, and alumni give generously of their time to undergraduate students seeking experiential learning. A recent survey by the University's Was - serman Center for Career Development showed that 83 percent of graduating seniors in the College held a job or internship related to their field of interest during their undergraduate years. Many different types of opportunities are available to students; some are paid, some involve volunteerism on the part of a student, and some carry academic credit\u2014and all of these can be valuable. For the purpose of securing and making the most of such opportunities, students should consider the following criteria as a guide. For further information, con - tact the Wasserman Center for Career Development (133 East 13th Street, 2nd Floor; 212-998-4730). Career counselors are available by appointment and during drop-in hours at the Wasserman Center). Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 504 504 Paid Internships These are the most common form of internship. Jobs related to a student's professional interests provide pay for the work that students are doing for the organization. Many companies and organizations provide part-time jobs that allow students to gain experience and to network in the field, while at the same time helping to alleviate the finan - cial burden of being a college student. (Please note: Some for-profit companies ask students to volunteer, but allow it only if the student can earn academic credit. Many of these so-called intern - ships do not relate directly to a student's academic work and might not be worthy of academic credit in a discipline. In these cases, the company should consid - er providing compensation for the work done by a student, thus making it a paid internship.) Credit-Bearing Internships A few departments offer academic internships that directly advance a student's knowledge in the academic discipline and thus earn course credit. Such academic internships must be sponsored by an appropriate faculty member through an academic de - partment and normally require close faculty supervision, significant academic research and writing in addition to the practical work experience, a reporting of findings, and a formal assessment of the student's work. All such internships require permission of the department or program, and registration for them mustbe within the regular deadlines. Depart - ments offering credit-bearing internships may restrict them to declared majors, since those students have the requisite background. Internship courses can be counted toward some majors but not toward others. Students should check relevant websites (and sections in this Bulletin) to learn more about the specific policies and procedures pertaining to credit-bearing internships in different CAS departments and programs. Whether an internship is paid or unpaid has no bearing on whether or not it can be taken for CAS credit. However, the decision to sponsor and grant credit for an internship, or not, rests solely with each academic department of the College. Academic credit for internships must be based solely on the academic work pro - duced in the internship. No credit should be awarded merely for attending the internship, whether paid or unpaid. The College recommends 2-point internships for academic work of approximately 10 pages of writing plus adequate reading. In rare cases student may earn 4 points; in these cases the academic work must be equivalent to that produced in a regular 4-point course. State Law and Credit-Bearing Internships Owing to recent changes in states' laws governing out-of-state entities and their right to award credit for certain educa - tional experiences, including internships, within state boundaries (known as \"stateauthorization\"), CAS can award credit for internships that take place in all U.S. states, districts, and territories, except for : California American Samoa Federated States of Micronesia Guam Northern Mariana Islands Republic of Palau Republic of the Marshall Islands For the most updated information, please consult the University's State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (SARA) webpage. Internships Abroad Whether a CAS student is able to par - ticipate in a for-credit internship outside the United States depends on many variables, including the student's country of citizenship and local laws in the host country. Please seek advisement and preapproval from Office of Global Programs staff ( global.internships@ nyu.edu ) and the director of undergrad - uate studies in your department before undertaking a non-U.S. internship. Independent Study In some CAS departments, independent study that draws on the activity or envi - ronment of the internship may be a pos - sibility. Like a credit-bearing internship, independent study requires a proposal by the student, careful guidance from a faculty member, and a body of work that can be evaluated for course credit. Preprofessional, Accelerated, and Specialized Programs / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22For information on all NYU summer programs, visit nyu.edu/summer . For information on all NYU winter programs (the January term), visit nyu.edu/winter .Students may meet with an adviser in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905 (212-998-8130) to dis - cuss summer or January course selection. Students with a declared major/minor are required to see their department adviser for summer or winter registration approval and for advice on which courses, if any, may count toward major/minor requirements. In all cases, students need an adviser's approval (\"clearance\") for their summer or January term course selection and registration, just as they do for the fall and spring terms. The College of Arts and Science offers a full range of courses in the summer. Over 400 arts and science courses are given on campus in the summer, in subjects ranging from social sciences to natural sciences to humanities. Qualified students may also enroll in courses open to undergraduates in the Graduate School of Arts and Science. The summer program is divided into two six-week sessions, and students may register for one or both sessions. Please visit nyu.edu/summer . Students from other colleges and universities may apply to participate as visiting students for the summer session, provided they have the proper prerequisites for the courses they wish to take. Application and deadline infor - mation may be found at nyu.edu/ admissions/visiting-students/apply .First-year and transfer students who have been accepted for the fall term at NYU may register for courses during the summer sessions. Interested students should contact the Office of Undergrad - uate Admissions to begin the process for enrolling in summer courses. They will then be referred to the College Advising Center for advisement and clearance. All students registered for at least one course are guaranteed housing. The College of Arts and Science (CAS) runs several summer away programs. Most programs are six weeks in du - ration; there are also three- and four- week programs. Led by a member of the distinguished Faculty of Arts and Science, each program meets specific academic goals in the study of the art, architecture, history, politics, language, or literature of the region. Specialized summer programs allow students to pursue concentrated work in creative writing (Florence and Paris), journalism (Ghana), and urban design (London). Study tours and weekend excursions are an integral part of each program. Program availability may vary from year to year. Admissions and curriculum information is available at nyu.edu/ summer/abroad/cas . A priority application deadline is specified for each program. Since some programs fill very quickly, applying before this deadline is strongly encouraged.

Weekend excursions may include trips to Mycenae and Epidaurus as well as Delphi, Olympia, and the Cycladic island of Santorini. Summer in Berlin Built around Berlin's rich culture, stu - dents are immersed in the life and language of the city. For those interest - ed in language study, Summer in Berlin offers German courses at all levels of instruction, based on sufficient enroll - ment per course. In addition, content courses provide students with the op - tion of exploring the historical past and exciting present of Germany's capital. Through walking tours and monument visits, students delve into the palaces of the baroque, rococo and romantic periods, the monumental government buildings and workers' tenements of the Wilhelminian Empire, the massive ministries and Olympic Stadium of the Third Reich, ruins from World War II and the Cold War era, and the exciting con - temporary art scene, gaining a uniquely German perspective. Summer in Brazil Summer in Brazil students benefit from all the advantages of the program host city, Recife, one of Brazil's most innova - tive artistic and cultural hubs. Located in the northeast of the country, it is well known for its cultural diversity and vibrant art scene, especially independent cinema. Offering a unique perspective outside of the more visited cities of Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo, Recife also boasts a world-renowned contemporary music scene, including popular musical forms such as forr\u00f3, maracatu, and frevo. In co-curricular programming, students will have the opportunity to experience the aquatic natural resources of Porto de Galinhas, to undertake museum visits, to explore the cultural roots of Brazil, and to visit other historic sites in the North - east, including Recife's sister city, Olinda, a UNESCO world heritage site. Summer in Dublin The focus of the summer program in Dublin is contemporary Ireland and its culture. The program is centered at Trinity College, Ireland's oldest university, situated in the heart of Dublin, where students reside and take classes. Courses include Irish literature, history, politics, visual and performing arts, creative writing, popular culture, and the Irish language. The academic program is complemented by a series of field trips and cultural and social activities designed to broaden students' knowl - edge of Ireland. Among the typical eve - ning activities are outings to the theatre, poetry readings, screenings at the new Irish Film Center, and traditional music sessions. Weekend excursions vary, but often include Donegal and Galway. Summer in Florence Summer in Florence is an undergrad - uate six-week summer program that offers courses in language, literature, culture, history, art, and architecture, providing students with a framework for understanding both the traditions of the past and the richness of contemporary culture in Florence.

Once applicants meet formal course requirements, their capacity for success - ful undergraduate work is measured through careful consideration of sec - ondary school and/or college records; recommendations from guidance counselors, teachers, and others; scores on standardized tests; and the personal essay and supplementary NYU essay. Each applicant is reviewed carefully to identify academic strength, potential for intellectual growth and creativity, and promise of fully utilizing the special offerings of the University and the city. Each applicant's record is considered objectively and evaluated for partici - pation in extracurricular and commu - nity services, in addition to scholarly pursuits. New York University actively seeks stu - dents who are varied in interests, talents, and goals, as well as in economic and social backgrounds. Particular attention is paid to the degree to which candidates have made the effective use of opportu - nities available to them, however great or limited those opportunities may have been. Evidence of character and maturity are regarded as essential in potential students who hope to benefit fully from the unique offerings of the University and its urban environment. Participation in meaningful school and community activities is an important factor. Applicants who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should refer to this section's heading \"applicants with international credentials.\" The Office of Undergraduate Admissions collects information on retention and graduation rates and employment after graduation.

Admission / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Admission 517 admissions.nyu.edu Office of Undergraduate Admissions 212-998-4500 RECOMMENDED HIGH SCHOOL PREPARATION THE ADMISSIONS PROCESSAt NYU CAS, the quality of an appli - cant's secondary school record is more important than a prescribed pattern of courses. First-year students who are best prepared to succeed at NYU will have explored the following topics in their high schools: four years of English with heavy emphasis on writing; three to four years of academic mathematics; three to four years of laboratory science; three to four years of social studies; and two to three years of foreign language. Students most competitive for admis - sion will exceed these minimums. The admissions committee pays particular attention to the number of honors, AP, and IB courses the applicant has completed in high school (when avail -able). It is strongly recommended that all applicants take mathematics and language courses in the senior year of high school. School counselors provide School Profile Reports that explain the curriculum and course offerings of the school for the admissions committee to have each student's full context when evaluating transcripts. All candidates for admission to the College must complete the Common Application (or Transfer Common Application for prospective transfer students) and the NYU Member Questions and Writing Supplement on the Common Application. Applicants must apply online, as there is no paper version of the application available. Any materials that a student or high school official is unable to submit online may be sent to: Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 383 Lafayette Street, Second Floor, New York, NY 10003. 518 518 A complete first-year application will include: The Common Application and the NYU Member Questions Official high school transcripts and/ or college transcripts for courses for which academic credit has been earned (and General Educational Development test scores, if applicable).

No credit is awarded for any examination on this table. Some of the foreign language examinations are offered both with and without a listening component; Core exemption (and, if applicable, placement) scores are the same. 2. Scores in these languages may only be used for Core exemption, not for placement. Students who intend to register for any of these languages at NYU must take the CAS placement examination.3. Scores in these languages may be used either for Core exemption or for placement in the proper level of study. Consult the website of the relevant CAS language department or the CAS Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, Room 908; 212-998-8110. Spanish results over 18 months old cannot be used for placement. 4. A score of 650 or better on either mathematics subject examination places students into Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) if they intend to register for these courses. An SAT general test mathematics score of 670 or higher (for SAT taken in and after March 2016) or 650 or higher (for SAT taken before March 2016) also serves as a prerequisite for MATH-UA 121 and 211, but cannot be used for exemption from the QR requirement.Chinese2 700 and up Foreign language French3 650 and up Foreign language German3 650 and up Foreign language Hebrew (Modern) 2 700 and up Foreign language Italian3 650 and up Foreign language Japanese2 700 and up Foreign language Korean2 700 and up Foreign language Latin2 650 and up Foreign language Mathematics Level 1 or 24 700 and up Quantitative Reasoning Spanish3 660 and up Foreign languageSAT Subject Examination1 Score Core Requirement Satisfied Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school (credits from either a community college or a four-year college or university are acceptable), provided that: they received a grade of \"B\" or better in the courses; an official transcript from the college or university is received; and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. These courses must be taken on a college/university campus with college/university students, and must be taught by a college/university faculty member; college courses taught in high schools by secondary school instructors are not acceptable. Also note that NYU does not grant credit for college courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements. Admission / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22After the admissions decision is made and the appropriate financial aid appli - cations are submitted, a request for financial aid is considered. NYU is a need-blind institution, meaning that the Office of Admissions and Office of Financial Aid operate independently of one another. The Office of Admissions makes admissions decisions without knowledge of a student's submitted financial aid documents. Specific ques - tions regarding award estimations or financial aid appeals are handled by our Office of Financial Aid counselors. All freshman students applying for financial aid must file the Free Applica - tion for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION 522 522 and the College Scholarship Service/ Financial Aid PROFILE (CSS PROFILE). We recommend that students apply electronically; see our NYU website. There is no fee charged to file the FAFSA but a fee is associated with the CSS PROFILE. When completing the CSS PROFILE, students will be made aware by the form whether they qualify for a fee waiver. Students must include the NYU federal school code number 002785 in the school section of the FAFSA and CSS PROFILE to ensure that their submitted information is transmitted by the processor to New York University. Transfer students applying for financial aid need only complete the FAFSA. New York State residents should also complete the separate application for the Tuition Assistance Program (TAP); for information, visit nyu.edu/admis - sions/undergraduate-admissions/ financial-aid . Students from other states may be required to complete separate applications for their state programs if their state grants can be used at New York University. EARLY DECISION FOR ENTERING FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS NYU offers two Early Decision applica - tion options for first-year applicants who are certain that NYU is their first-choice university. Students applying as Early Decision candidates will receive their admission decision after December 15th (Early Decision I) or after February 15th (Early Decision II). An Outline of NYU's Early Decision Philosophy and Process NYU's Early Decision programs are bind - ing agreements, whereby if an applicant is offered admission and provided with a financial aid package that enables the student to enroll, the student must withdraw any previously submitted applications and accept NYU's admis - sion offer\u2014roughly within two to three weeks of receiving an admission offer. These students are then restricted from filing any new applications and are expected to withdraw any active appli - cations to other schools. Providing that a student has completed the CSS PROFILE and the FAFSA online, the student will be provided with a financial aid estimate soon after the student is offered admission. Again, admitted students will have roughly two to three weeks to review their financial aid pack - age before confirming their enrollment at NYU. The FAFSA becomes available on January 1st and should be completed by admitted Early Decision candidates after submitting an enrollment deposit. FAFSA now allows students to complete the form using \"Prior Year\" data. The FAFSA filing deadlines are now the same as the CSS deadlines for each notification plan. We believe that part of our commitment to Early Decision applicants is indeed to provide an early decision ; for that reason, we typically either admit or deny Early Decision candidates and do not waitlist them. The Early Decision (both I and II) agreements are binding with the following exceptions: If students are admitted to a program different than the primary program of interest listed on their Common Application; if the received financial aid package is insufficient to meet the estimated cost of attendance; if a student is admitted to an NYU degree-granting campus that was not listed as their first choice on the Common Application. Early Decision and Financial Aid NYU uses the same methodology in providing financial aid for Early Decision candidates as we do in providing finan - cial aid for Regular Decision candidates. Students are not offered more or less financial aid based on when they apply for admission. For Early Decision I candidates, we use information students share with us via the CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE online to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after December 15th. For Early Decision II candidates, we use this information to provide admitted students with an estimated financial aid package after February 15th. Students will only be released from the Early Decision agreement if they believe their estimated financial aid package does not enable them to attend. Students must be aware that applying Early Decision will not enable them to compare financial aid packages from other universities. If comparing financial aid packages will be necessary for a student, the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. the student should apply under our Regular Decision program. Early Decision Application Process 1. Complete the Common Application and NYU Supplement online, and check either the Early Decision I or II option. 2. Download and sign the Early Decision Agreement from the Common Appli - Admission / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 523 523 A student may be admitted by transfer from another college or university in September, January, or May. (See \"the admission process,\" above.) Credit will be granted for most collegiate work completed with a grade of C or better within the last 10 years that satisfies degree requirements and that falls within the residency requirement, with the exception of certain courses of a vocational nature or courses not con - sistent with the educational objectives of the College. Within these provisions, applicants from regionally accredited colleges are eligible for admission. Except when specifically noted, the gen - eral procedures described for entering freshmen apply to all applicants seeking to transfer from other two-year or four- year regionally accredited institutions. Transfer applicants must submit official credentials and transcripts from all insti - tutions attended, including secondaryschool transcripts. Transfer applicants who took the SAT or ACT exams while in high school should submit their test results as part of their application if they have fewer than 32 credits or one full academic year of college coursework at the time of application. Transfer applicants who are required to submit standardized testing may also adhere to our test-flexible (or test-optional, depending on the program) policy for score submission. Credit may be awarded for satisfactory work completed at another accredited college or university. When a transfer applicant is admitted to the College, the applicant's official college transcript(s) is (are) examined carefully to determine how much, if any, advanced standing will be granted. Each individual course completed elsewhere is evaluated. In granting advanced standing, the following are considered: the content, complexity, and grading standards of courses taken elsewhere; individual grades and grade averages attained by the applicant; the suitability of courses taken elsewhere for the program of study chosen here; and the degree of preparation that complet - ed courses provide for more advanced study here. Point credit toward the degree is given only for a grade of C or better and provided that the credit fits into the selected program of study and courses were completed within the past 10 years. Quarter hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of credits transferable to NYU. Credits based on semester hours will be transferred at face value to NYU. As with all other students, transfer stu - dents are required to fulfill the residency requirement. All degree candidates are subject to the following residency re - quirement: They must complete at least 64 consecutive points of course work in residence at the College immediately preceding the date of graduation and are permitted to transfer a maximum of 64 credits to NYU. A tentative statement of advanced standing is provided to each transfer student upon notification of admission to the College. A final statement of ad - vanced standing is provided during the student's first semester of matriculation. Requests for reevaluation of transfer credit must be made within the semester during which the final statement of ad - vanced standing is received. Thereafter, a student's advanced standing credits may be changed only with the written permission of the Office of the Dean.TRANSFER APPLICANTS ADVANCED STANDING FOR TRANSFER STUDENTS Admission / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22cation website.

Admission / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 526 526 NYU JANUARY TERM READMISSION OF FORMER STUDENTS THE ENROLLMENT PROCESSNew York University's January Term allows students more flexibility and new scheduling options. NYU students, visiting students, and international students have the opportunity to earn major/minor credit or explore a new interest. During this time, students can take advantage of intensive study at one of the foremost research and teaching universities in the United States, as well as have a chance to enjoy New York City during a bustling and exciting time of year. Oftentimes, the fall and spring semes - ters can be overly hectic for students, considering a full-time course load, student club responsibilities, work, and internship commitments. This busy time doesn't always allow the freedom to explore a new academic interest or take advantage of the many cultural resources that originally drew them to New York City. January Term provides an array of courses enabling students to earn academic credit (major, minor, or elective) in courses that are in high de - mand, to accelerate degree completion, and to concentrate on personal interests. Further information is available at nyu.edu/winter . Any former student who has been out of attendance for more than two con - secutive terms and who wishes to return to the College must apply for readmis - sion. Applications for readmission are available online. (See admission applica -tion filing deadlines above.) Requests for readmission should be received by April 1 for the summer and fall terms and November 1 for the spring term, but will be considered after those deadlines on a space available basis.Students who have attended another college or university since their last attendance at New York University must complete the regular application for transfer admission and submit an official transcript. To be enrolled, an admitted undergradu - ate candidate must do the following: Accept the University's offer of admission and pay the required nonrefundable tuition deposit. If applicable, pay the required nonrefundable housing deposit. Have his or her high school and/or college forward a final transcript(s) to the Undergraduate Admissions Processing Center. File a medical report. Make an appointment with the individual school or division for academic advisement. Pay balance of tuition and/or housing fees by the stipulated deadlines. Register for classes when notified. Admission / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22CREDIT BY EXAMINATION (INCLUDING INTERNATIONAL MATURITY EXAMS) The Advanced Placement (AP) Program (College Entrance Examination Board), the International Baccalaureate (IB) Program, and the results of some foreign maturity certificate examinations enable undergraduate students to receive credit toward the bachelor's degree on the basis of performance in college-level examinations or proficiency examina - tions related to the College's degree requirements, subject to the approval of the College. The maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved) shall not exceed a total of 32. Students cannot earn credit for the same subject matter in any combination of AP, 527 527 ADVANCED PLACEMENT PROGRAM The College participates in the Advanced Placement (AP) Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. In accor - dance with New York University policy, students may receive college credit toward their degree for test results of 5 or 4, depending on the subject exam - ination. The College awards AP credit in liberal arts subjects that correspond to the disciplines taught in CAS, and the College's academic departments and programs regularly review and make final decisions on acceptance of AP credits\u2014in some cases with the review and approval of the CAS Committee on Undergraduate Curriculum. Some AP exams are deemed the equivalent of specific CAS courses and are approved to count toward the College's majors and minors. Other exams do not have a specific course equivalent and cannot count toward a major or minor, but award elective credit that students can count toward the 128 points required for the baccalaureate degree. In many cases, students receiving credit toward their degree are advised not to take the corresponding college-level course for credit. If they do, they will lose the AP credit. See the chart below concerning those AP test scores for which credit is given. The chart also lists those tests for which College Core Curriculum equiva - lencies and exemptions are granted. For additional information, students should consult the Office of Undergrad - uate Admissions online or by telephone at 212-998-4500.

For the other maturity examinations, please note that not every subject is awarded credit by the College. Creditworthy results earn 8 points each. Minimum scores for receiving credit are: A Levels: B Cambridge Pre-U: M2 CAPE: II (out of VII) French Baccalaur\u00e9at: 12 (out of 20) with coefficient of 5 or better German Abitur: 10 (out of 15). Credit is only awarded for written exams (schr.), not for oral (mdl.) Italian Maturit\u00e0: 90 (out of 100)* Swiss Matura: 4.5 (out of 6) * Policy on the Italian Maturit\u00e0: Students must earn a 90 or higher on the final Maturit\u00e0 exam to be considered for advanced standing credit. Credit is awarded on the basis of scores on part one (a test of written Italian) and part two (one subject tested in depth, which rotates from year to year). Each of these two sections can award 4 points, with a minimum score requirement of 13 (out of a possible 15). Neither part three of the written test nor the oral portion of the exam awards any points. 528 528 Note: a 4 or 5 on any foreign language AP satisfies the Core language requirement. Note: the College accepts a score of 5 (not 4) on the Russian Language and Culture Prototype AP examination for exemption from the foreign language requirement, but no credit is awarded and the score cannot be used for placement; scores of 4 or lower award no credit and have no bearing on exemption or placement.ADVANCED PLACEMENT CREDIT AND THE COLLEGE CORE CURRICULUM ADVANCED PLACEMENT EQUIVALENCIES1Biology 4, 5 Physical Science and Life Science Chemistry 4, 5 Physical Science and Life Science Environmental Science 4, 5 Physical Science Mathematics AB 4, 5 Quantitative Reasoning Mathematics BC 4, 5 Quantitative Reasoning Physics 1 or Physics 2 4, 5 Physical Science Physics 1 and Physics 2 4, 5 Physical Science and Life Science Physics C\u2014Mech. and Physics C\u2014E&M 4, 5 Physical Science and Life Science Physics C\u2014Mech. 4, 5 Physical Science Physics C\u2014E&M 4, 5 Physical Science Statistics 4, 5 Quantitative Reasoning AP Examination Score Core Requirement Satisfied Art History 4 4 No course equivalent2 Art History 5 4 ARTH-UA 1 and ARTH-UA 23 Biology 4, 5 8 BIOL-UA 11, 124 Calculus AB 4, 5 4 MATH-UA 1215 Calculus BC 4 4 MATH-UA 1215 Calculus BC 5 8 MATH-UA 121, 1225 Chemistry 4, 5 8 CHEM-UA 125, 126 / CHEM-UA 127, 1286 Chinese Language and Culture 4, 5 4 EAST-UA 2047 Computer Science A 4, 5 4 CSCI-UA 101 Computer Science Principles 4, 5 4 No course equivalent8 English Literature 4, 5 4 No course equivalent English Language - - No course equivalent Environmental Science 4, 5 4 No course equivalent9 European History 4, 5 4 No course equivalent10 French Language and Culture 4, 5 4 FREN-UA 30 German Language and Culture 4, 5 4 GERM-UA 411 Human Geography - - No course equivalent Italian Language and Culture 4, 5 4 ITAL-UA 12 Japanese Language and Culture 4, 5 4 EAST-UA 2507 Latin 4, 5 4 CLASS-UA 612 Macroeconomics 4, 5 4 ECON-UA 113 Microeconomics 4, 5 4 ECON-UA 213 Music Theory 4, 5 4 No course equivalent14 Physics 1 4, 5 4 No course equivalent15 Physics 2 4, 5 4 No course equivalent15 AP Examination Score Points Course Equivalent Admission / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 529 529 Physics C\u2014Mech 4, 5 5 or 3 PHYS-UA 11 or PHYS-UA 9115 Physics C\u2014E&M 4, 5 5 or 3 PHYS-UA 12 or PHYS-UA 9315 Politics (U.S. Gov't and Politics) 4, 5 4 No course equivalent16 Politics (Comp.

This section provides information on both of these distinct but related topics. Following is the schedule of fees estab - lished by the Board of Trustees of New York University for the year 2020-2021. The Board of Trustees reserves the right to alter this schedule without notice. Tuition, fees, and expenses may be expected to increase in subsequent years and will be listed in online updates to this Bulletin. Students should also consult nyu.edu/bursar for this updated information. Note that the registration and services fee covers membership, dues, etc., to the student's class organization and entitles the student to membership in such University activities as are sup - ported by this allocation and to receive regularly those University and College publications that are supported in whole or in part by the student activities fund. It also includes the University's health services, emergency and accident coverage, and technology fees. Note: Deposits may be required for laboratory courses. Students should consult the respective departments for information. All fees are payable at the time of registration. The Office of the Bursar is located at 383 Lafayette Street, 1st Floor. Checks and drafts are to be drawn to the order of New York University for the exact amount of the tuition and fees required. In the case of an overpayment, the credit is issued by requesting a refund through the Office of the Bursar. A fee will be charged if payment is not made by the due date indicated on the student's statement. The unpaid balance of a student's account is also subject to an interest charge of 12 percent per annum from the first day of class until payment is received. Holders of New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) awards will be allowed credit toward their tuition fees in the amount of their entitlement, provided they are New York State residents and are enrolled on a full-time basis. Students who receive TAP awards after registration and have a credit balance on their account will receive a refund from the University after the New York State payment has been received by the Office of the Bursar and the Office of the Registrar has confirmed eligibility.

An official withdrawal must be filed either on Albert (through the first two weeks of the term only) or in writing on a completed change of program (drop/add) form with the Office of the University Registrar. (Note: an official withdrawal must be filed if a course has been canceled, and, in this case, the student is entitled to a refund of tuition and registration fees paid.) Withdrawal does not necessarily entitle the student to a refund of tuition paid or a can - cellation of tuition still due. A refund of tuition will be made provided such withdrawal is filed within the scheduled refund period for the term. (See the following schedules.) Merely ceasing to attend a class does not constitute official withdrawal, nor does notification to the instructor. A stop payment of a check presented for tuition does not constitute withdrawal, nor does it reduce the indebtedness to the University. The nonreturnable registration fee and a penalty fee of $20 for a stopped payment must be charged in addition to any tuition not canceled. The date on which the change of program form is filed, not the last date of attendance in class, is considered the official date of the student's withdrawal. It is this date that serves as the basis for computing any refund granted the student. The processing of refunds takes approximately two weeks. There are two distinct refund schedules (see below): For students withdrawing from some courses, but not all; and for students withdrawing from all courses. Undergraduate Refund Schedule, Withdrawing from Some Courses (Fall and Spring Only) Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term: 100% of tuition and fees* Courses dropped after the first two weeks of the term: NONE The above refund schedule is not applicable to students whose registra -tion remains within the flat-fee range of 12 to 18 points per term. * Note: All fees (including school-related fees) are nonreturnable after the second calendar week of the semester. Undergraduate Refund Schedule, Withdrawing from All Courses (Fall and Spring Only) This schedule is based on the total applicable charge for tuition, excluding nonreturnable fees and deposits. Withdrawal on or before the official opening date of the term : 100% of tuition and fees Withdrawal on the second day after the official opening date of the term through the end of the first calendar week: 100% of tuition only Note: The first calendar week consists of the first seven (7) calendar days beginning with the official opening date of the term (not the first day of the class meeting). Withdrawal within the second calendar week of the term: 70% (tuition only)WITHDRAWAL AND REFUND OF TUITION Tuition, Fees, and Financial Aid / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 536 536 Withdrawal within the third calendar week of the term: 55% (tuition only) Withdrawal within the fourth calendar week of the term: 25% (tuition only) Withdrawal after completion of the fourth calendar week of the term: NONE Note: All fees (including school-related fees) are nonreturnable after the official first day of the semester. Note: A student may not withdraw from a class after the ninth week of the fall or spring semester or in the last two weeks of each six-week summer session. Exceptions to the published refund schedule may be appealed in writing to the refund committee in the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130) and should be supported by appropriate documenta - tion regarding the circumstances that warrant consideration of an exception. Exceptions are rarely granted. Students who withdraw should review the \"refunds\" page on the Office of the Bursar's website.Federal regulations require adjustments reducing financial aid if a student with - draws even after the NYU refund period. Financial aid amounts will be adjusted for students who withdraw through the ninth week of the semester and have received any federal grants or loans. This adjustment may result in the student's bill not being fully paid. NYU will bill the student for this difference. The student will be responsible for payment of this bill before returning to NYU and will remain responsible for payment even if he or she does not return to NYU. For any semester a student receives any aid, that semester will be counted in the satisfactory academic progress standard. This may require the student to make up credits before receiving any further aid. Please review the satisfacto - ry academic progress standard on the Office of Financial Aid website, so as not to jeopardize future semesters of aid. Tuition Insurance Tuition Refund Insurance provides families an option to protect their hard-earned tuition dollars. This cover - age complements New York University's Refund Policy, allowing students to re - ceive up to 100% refund, up to the policy limits, throughout the term for a covered medical withdrawal. Tuition Refund Insurance reduces the financial risk inherent in the investment in higher education by refunding lost tuition, academic fees and other related expenses, up to the policy limits, should a student be forced to withdraw for medical reasons. We are pleased to offer Undergraduate students a Tuition Refund Insurance program. Refunds are paid by Grad - Guard to the University for credit to the student account. Outstanding loans, grants, scholarships, etc. would be paid before any remaining funds are refunded to the student. Information and enrollment in the Tuition Refund Insurance Plan can be found at gradguard.com/tuition-insurance/ partners . New York University awards financial aid to help students meet the difference between their own resources and the cost of education. All awards are subject to availability of funds and the student's demonstrated need. Renewal of assis - tance depends on annual reevaluation of a student's need, the availability of funds, the successful completion of the previous year, and satisfactory progress toward completion of degree require - ments. In addition, students must meet the published filing deadlines. Visit Financial Aid and Scholarships at nyu.edu/financial.aid for full access to the information and procedures summa -rized here. Particular attention should be given to (1) types of financial aid (for scholarships, grants, loans), (2) how to apply, and (3) applications and forms. These topics are included on the naviga - tion bar located on the home page. Applying for Financial Aid at NYU The following applications are the forms students must submit for any and all types of financial aid we award at NYU, including all need-based and merit- based scholarships: CSS Profile (all new first-year appli - cants regardless of citizenship status; applicants whose parents are separat - ed, divorced, or unmarried and do not live together will need to have both parents submit their own separate CSS Profile applications) CSS Profile Waiver Request for the Noncustodial Parent (under certain circumstances, NYU will consider waiving the CSS Profile for the noncus - todial parent if the information cannot be obtained) Undocumented Student Financial Aid Application (all new freshmen and transfer applicants who are undocumented, in addition to the submission of the CSS Profile)FINANCIAL AID Tuition, Fees, and Financial Aid / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 537 537 The following applications are the forms students must submit for federal and state financial aid: Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) [only new first-years and transfer applicants who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or eligible non-citizens (i.e. refugees, etc.)] New York State Tuition Assistance Program (TAP) (only new first-year and transfer applicants who are New York State residents, including undocumented students) NOTE: Applicants must file all their relevant applications by the deadlines to be considered for NYU scholarships and grants.

Federal financial aid requires students to be making satisfactory academic prog - ress toward degree requirements. Most NYU undergraduate scholarships are automatically renewed each year as long as the student is enrolled full-time. To renew federal financial aid, students who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or eligible non-citizens must submit the FAFSA each year. Finally, students must be in an approved program of study registered with the State of New York. Withdrawal Students receiving federal student aid who withdraw completely may be billed for remaining balances resulting from the mandatory return of funds to the U.S. government. The amount of federal aid \"earned\" up to that point is determined by the withdrawal date and a calculation based upon the federally prescribed formula. Generally, federal assistance is earned on a pro-rata basis. Tuition, Fees, and Financial Aid / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Registration, Advisement, and Counseling / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Registration, Advisement, and Counseling 538 REGISTRATION The College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905) provides advising, academic services, and information on registration throughout the year. Any student with a question or problem is invited to come to the office or to call 212-998-8130 and ask for assistance. Office hours are weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Students complete their initial registra - tion through Albert, the University-wide portal to the student information system, at home.nyu.edu . Students also use Albert to make later adjustments to their schedule. Continuing Students Students currently enrolled in the College register early for the following semester\u2014in November for the spring term and in April for the fall term. Stu - dents who are currently enrolled or on an official leave of absence receive notification of the date and time when they can register. Before registering, students plan a provisional schedule and put it in the \"shopping cart\" function of Albert. They also discuss their program and planned courses with their adviser, who then clears them for registration. At the appointed time or thereafter, students access Albert to register. Students must complete registration by paying their tuition and fees. Online tuition statements and payment options are available through the Office of the Bursar.New Students Newly admitted students receive detailed instructions about orientation and registration, as well as the name and contact information of an adviser in the College Advising Center who assists them in academic planning, course selection, and registration. Transfer students with a declared major also have an opportunity to discuss their program with a faculty member in their chosen major department. For preregistration immunization re - quirements, please see \"immunization requirements\" in the academic policies section of this Bulletin. College Advising Center The College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130; cas.nyu.edu/advising ) offers a wide range of services and programs designed to meet the needs of a diverse student body. The advisers serve as a basic source of information about the degree requirements, policies, and procedures of the College. Academic and career development events are sponsored or cosponsored to assist students in planning academic programs, choosing a major, and negotiating registration. In addition, various cocurricular edu -cational opportunities, from informal faculty talks to seminars and lectures, are arranged through the center. Sup - port programs are available for African American and Latino students; inter - national students; undecided students; first-generation students; and first-years, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Advisers also meet individually with students who want to discuss concerns or questions they may have about the University. The advisers serve as a liaison with other offices and can make referrals when appropriate. The College Advising Center is thus the best place for students to visit when they are unsure of where to go for help. It is open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Questions about cross-registration in other schools of the University, com - bined degree programs, and the College Core Curriculum may be brought to the College Advising Center and Academic Resource Center or ARC (18 Washington Place). Please also see the sections on the College Core Curriculum and prepro - fessional, accelerated, and specialized programs in this Bulletin.ADVISEMENT 539 539 First-Year Students All first-year students participate in the College Cohort Program (CCP). The CCP begins with a virtual advising and registration process during the early summer, including selection of a First- Year Seminar, which is required for all CAS first-year students. The First-Year Seminar determines placement in a small advising cohort. There is also an extensive academic orientation and introduction to the CCP during Welcome Week. During fall of the first year, cohorts come together every other week for a \"cohort meeting,\" where they work closely with their academic adviser and a college leader (an upperclass mentor) explor - ing topics which form a foundation for engaging in the variety of academic and cultural offerings at NYU, through NYC, and at NYU's study away sites. Students can meet as often as they would like with their advisers individually outside the context of the cohort meeting and are required to meet for individual advising appointments prior to registra -tion for the following semester. Cohorts continue meeting through the spring semester of the first year. The assigned CAS adviser remains available to students throughout their undergraduate experience and serves as the primary source for academic advising until the student declares a major. Transfer Students Advising for students who are trans - ferring to CAS from another college or university begins once the College is notified that they have accepted admission. Students begin with a virtual advising and registration process which includes direct contact with an academic adviser who can interpret the transfer credit report, assist with course selection, and answer all questions about degree requirements and registration. Transfer students are also invited to a special orientation session which provides additional information needed to make a smooth transition into the College. CAS advisers lead these sessions along with current upperclassmen who serve as student resources throughout the orientation and transition. Transfer students participate in the College Cohort Program (CCP) and are assigned an academic adviser within the College Advising Center. Transfer students approaching junior standing must also declare a major and meet with an assigned adviser in the major department in order to ensure that appropriate course selections for the following semester are being made. Departmental Advisement Students who have declared a major go to their major's department for their primary advisement. All declared majors must have their registration approved by a departmental adviser. Departmental advisers can also be consulted through - out the academic year about graduate study and career opportunities. Office hours for departmental advisers are maintained in the departmental offices. The College of Arts and Science oper - ates Learning Centers in the Academic Resource Center or ARC (18 Washington Place) and in University Hall (110 East 14th Street, UHall Commons). The Learn - ing Centers provide extensive academic support services, free of charge, to students in all divisions of the University who take courses in the College. With their highly visible and accessible settings, they serve to link academics with students' residential and campus lives. Services offered by the centers include the following: Individual and group tutoring sessions Examination review sessions Study skills assessment and academic skills workshops For further information on services, offerings, and schedules at the ULC, please visit nyu.edu/ulc . Counseling and Wellness Services (CWS) at the College of Arts and Science is located at Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 920, and is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Counseling\u2014or psycho - therapy\u2014is a confidential professional relationship that focuses on personal problems, such as concerns about interpersonal relationships; poor grades or other academic problems; emotional issues such as feelings of inadequacy, THE UNIVERSITY LEARNING CENTER COUNSELING AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCE Registration, Advisement, and Counseling / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 540 540 anxiety, or lonelness; sexual problems; eating disorders; substance abuse; or family conflict. Unlike friends, counselors can be objective, since they are not involved in your daily life. Unlike most doctors, counselors don't give specific advice or tell you what to do. Instead, they serve as skilled listeners who help you to clarify issues, discover your true wishes and feelings, and deal more effectively with whatever problems you may be dealing with. CWS services include individual psychotherapy, themed workshops, and therapy groups. When necessary, medication and referrals to providers in the community are available. Counseling services are free for any full- or part- time student enrolled in the University. Appointments are scheduled through the main counseling office at the Student Health Center, 726 Broadway, 4th Floor, or by phone at 212-998-4780. Students can also be seen without an appointment during walk-in hours at the Wellness Exchange at 726 Broadway, 3rd floor; please review current hours for drop-in appointments at nyu.edu/ wellness.exchange . NYU's Wellness Exchange offers a 24-hour hotline at 212-443-9999, and can also be reached by email ( wellness.exchange @nyu.edu ) or via the Wellness Exchange app, which can be downloaded for iPhones or Android devices. Various Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) programs provide educational benefits for spouses, sons, and daughters of deceased or permanently disabled veterans, as well as for veterans and in-service personnel, subject to certain restrictions. Under most programs, the student does not pay tuition and fees at the time of registration, but will have anticipated aid placed onto the student account based on the estimated amount of coverage from the VA. This applies primarily to Chapter 31 and 33 benefit recipients. Veterans with service-connected disabil - ities may qualify for educational benefits under Chapter 31. Applicants for this program are required to submit to the Department of Veterans Affairs a letter of acceptance from the college they wish to attend. Upon meeting the re - quirements, the Department of Veterans Affairs will assign a case manager who will issue an electronic authorization form directly to NYU's VA School Certifying Official (SCO) that serves course approval for the veteran and assurance that the VA will cost the cost of tuition and fees.Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is usually sent directly to veterans by the VA; students must be enrolled at a rate of more than half time to qualify for this benefit, and must be enrolled full time to receive the full monthly BAH rate. Veterans and eligible dependents should contact the Office of the University Reg - istrar each term for which they desire certification of enrollment. Students eligible for BAH will only receive this benefit if their enrollment is certified with the VA each term. All veterans are expected to reach the objective (bachelor's or master's degree, doctorate, or certificate) authorized by the VA with the minimum number of points required. The Department of Veterans Affairs may not authorize allowance payments for points that are in excess of scholastic requirements, that are taken for audit purposes only, or for which non-punitive grades (i.e. \"W\") are received. Applications and further information may be obtained from the student's regional office of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Additional inquiries can be directed to the certifying official in the Office of the Registrar. Since interpretation of regulations governing veterans' benefits is subject to change, veterans should keep in touch with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans who wish to utilize their ed - ucational benefits for themselves or a spouse or dependent must first apply directly with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA will then determine eligibility for educational benefits, which is outlined in a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) letter that is issued to the veteran. Students will be expected to use the COE letter as proof of eligibility in the first term of enrollment. Upon enrollment, students should submit a request to be certified with the Certifications team in the Office of the Registrar. An online request form is available at nyu.edu/ registrar in the Veterans portion of the site. Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program NYU is pleased to participate in the Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhance - ment Program (Yellow Ribbon Program), a provision of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. The program is designed to help stu -VETERANS' BENEFITS Registration, Advisement, and Counseling / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 541 541 dents finance, through scholarship assistance, up to 100 percent of their out-of-pocket tuition and fees associated with education programs that may ex - ceed the Post-9/11 GI Bill tuition benefit, which will only pay up to the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition. Beginning in the 2009-2010 academic year, NYU has provided Yellow Ribbon funds toward the tuition of each qualify - ing veteran, with the VA matching NYU's tuition contribution for each student. To be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon benefits, an individual must be entitled to the maximum Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit. An individual may be eligible for the Yellow Ribbon Enhancement if: He/she served an aggregate period of active duty after September 10, 2001, of at least 36 months. He/she was honorably discharged from active duty for a service-connected disability and had served 30 continuous days after September 10, 2001. He/she is a dependent eligible for transfer of entitlement under the Post-9/11 GI Bill based on a veteran's service under the eligibility criteria, as described on the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs website. Yellow Ribbon funding is activated when the student has remaining tuition charges after all Post-9/11 GI Bill funding has been exhausted for the academic year, which begins in the fall term and ends the following summer term. For up to date amounts regarding the Post-9/11 GI Bill and a complete list of Yellow Ribbon awards at NYU, visit nyu.edu/ registrar and refer to the Veterans site. Registration, Advisement, and Counseling / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22The University confers the following degrees on candidates recommended by the faculty of the College of Arts and Science and approved by the trustees of New York University: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) B.A. programs are offered by all departments of the College except that of neural science.Bachelor of Science (B.S.) B.S. programs are offered by the following departments of the College: chemistry, neural science (no B.A. op - tion), and physics. They are also offered for the combined major in global public health and science, with a concentration in biology or chemistry (no B.A. option). For details, see the sections on these individual departments and majors in this Bulletin. The College also offers jointly with the NYU Tandon School of Engineering a dual-degree, Bachelor of Science/Bachelor of Science (B.S./B.S.) program; see the engineering section in this Bulletin. Further information on engineering is available from the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Degree Requirements / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Degree Requirements 542 The general degree requirements are the same for the B.A. and the B.S., with the exception of the engineering B.S./B.S. To be eligible for the bachelor's degree, students must complete 128 points with a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0. Within these points, students must fulfill the requirements of both a major (also completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0) and the College Core Curriculum.The degree requirements to be fulfilled are those in effect during the term of the student's first registration in the College. Registration in another division of New York University does not constitute a registration in the College of Arts and Science. Readmitted students must fulfill the requirements as listed in the College of Arts and Science Bulletin published during the year of their readmission, unless their readmission letter states otherwise.In very exceptional cases, a student may petition the Committee on Undergradu - ate Academic Standards for approval of a change in the requirements as stated in the Bulletin. Petitions are filed through the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909, 212-998-8140; cas.nyu.edu/academic- standards . Degrees are conferred in September, January, and May. The formal conferring of degrees by the president of the University takes place annually at Commencement in May. Major requirements, varying from de - partment to department, are specified in the sections of this Bulletin devoted to the course listings of individual departments and programs. Generally, a little more than one-third of the total points are earned in the major.Every student must complete a major with a cumulative grade point average in the major of at least 2.0. At least one-half of the courses (and in some GENERAL REQUIREMENTS CONFERRING OF DEGREES THE MAJOR 543 departments, at least one-half of the points) used to complete the major must be taken in the College of Arts and Science. A student may not register for courses in the major outside of NYU. The student must be accepted as a major in the department and must review his or her program with a department adviser each term.College of Arts and Science students may not major in other divisions of the University, with the exception of cinema studies (with Tisch School of the Arts), engineering (a dual-degree program with the Tandon School of Engineer - ing), global public health (combined majors with the College of Global Public Health), and public policy (a joint major with the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service). Students in the NYU Tandon School of Engineering may not declare a major or minor in the College if the desired field of study is offered at Tandon. 543 Students go to the office of the depart - ment or program to declare a major and have it posted in the Student Information System (Albert). Students who have earned 64 or more points must declare a major. Those with fewer than 64 points are strongly encouraged to declare a major as early in their academic career as possible.DECLARATION Students may take a double (second) major. The same requirements, including the maintenance of a minimum grade point average of 2.0, apply to the second major as to the first. The second major is declared in the same way as the first (see above). In some cases, courses may be appli - cable to both majors if the academic departments consider this appropriate. Students must then obtain written approval for the shared course(s) from the directors of undergraduate studies of both departments. No student may double count more than two courses between two majors (or between a major and a minor, or between two minors); some departments have set more restrictive sharing rules (a limit of one shared course, or none at all) as in - dicated in their sections of this Bulletin. No course may ever be triple-counted among any combination of three majors and/or minors. The minor requirements are found in the departmental sections of the Bulletin. The (optional) minor must be completed with a minimum grade point average of 2.0.The minor is declared at the office of the sponsoring department or program. No more than one minor can be com - pleted outside of the College in theother divisions of NYU, as the limit on non-CAS credits is set at 16 points. The major and minor requirements to be followed are those stated in the depart - mental sections of the Bulletin in effect during the semester of the student's first registration in the College. No credittoward the major or minor is granted for grades of C-minus or lower, although such grades will be computed into the grade point average of the major or theminor, as well as into the overall grade point average. No course to be counted toward the major or minor may be taken on a Pass/DOUBLE MAJOR THE MINOR REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO BOTH MAJOR AND MINOR Degree Requirements / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 544 544 All requirements for a degree in the College must be met within a period of eight years from the date of matric - ulation. For transfer students and for students who are readmitted to the College, the length of time is propor -tionately reduced. Transfer credit is not granted for courses taken more than 10 years before the student's matricu - lation in the College. and universities must have the written approval of the director of undergraduate studies to count transfer courses toward the major or the minor. Once a student transfers to the College, all course work must be completed at NYU. (See also \"transfer students,\" below.) Once a student enrolls in the College of Arts and Science (first year and/or transfer), all course work used to satisfy the 128-credit degree requirement must be completed at NYU. All students must complete a minimum of 64 points in College of Arts and Science coursework (-UA suffix). Students must complete their last 32 points while registered in the College. In addition, students must be registered in the College during the semester immediately prior to graduation, unless officially approved for a leave of absence in that semester. One-half of the courses used to complete the major or the minor must be taken in the College. Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor requirements must be approved by the department. Transfer students, whether external or internal, must complete 64 points in College of Arts and Science coursework (-UA suffix) and must earn a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 overall, in the required major, and in the optional minor. Courses taken in other NYU schools (i.e., without a -UA suffix) do not count toward the 64 credit minimum. Neither do NYU Abu Dhabi (-AD/UH) or NYU Shanghai (-SH) courses. (However, -UA study away courses do count toward the 64 points.) At least one-half of the courses used to complete the major and any minor must be courses offered by the College (-UA suffix). Any transfer courses to be applied toward major or minor re - quirements must be approved by the department and may not exceed one-half of the required coursework for the major or minor. Courses in which a grade of C-minus or lower was obtained are not transferable. Grades earned from external transfer courses are not calculated in the NYU grade point average. Fail basis. (See \"Pass/Fail option\" under academic policies in this Bulletin.) Transfer students from other colleges and universities must have the written approval of the director of undergrad - uate studies to count transfer courses toward the major or the minor. Once a student transfers to the College, all course work must be completed at NYU. (See also \"transfer students,\" below.) TIME LIMIT RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT TRANSFER STUDENTS Degree Requirements / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Academic Policies 545 ACADEMIC PROGRAM The programs and courses offered at the College of Arts and Science are designed for students who attend classes offered during the day on a full-time basis. A full-time schedule normally consists of 16 points per term, or 32 points per year, which enables a student to complete the entire program of 128 points in four years. Minimal full-time status entails completing at least 12 points per term, or 24 points per year. Students who wish to attend part-time should speak with their academic adviser in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Such status will be granted only when there is good and sufficient reason for part-time study. Failure to complete a minimum of 24 points per year jeopardizes a student's full-time status. Failure to complete 32 points per year may jeopardize a student's eligibility to receive financial aid; students should discuss their situation with the Office of Financial Aid in the StudentLink Center, 383 Lafayette Street. Students may register for more than 18 points per term with the approval and clearance of their academic adviser. Change of Program To make any changes in their program, including dropping or adding courses given in other divisions of the Univer - sity, students must access Albert via NYUHome or file a change of program (\"drop/add\") form with the Office of the Registrar in the StudentLink Center, 383 Lafayette Street.Adding Courses The deadline for the adding of a course or a section is the end of the second week of the semester. The deadline applies to any course added by a Col - lege of Arts and Science student and to any College of Arts and Science course added by students from other divisions. The adding of any course or section after the end of the second week is generally allowed only with the written approval of both the instructor and Academic Standards in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140. Dropping and Withdrawing from Courses Students are expected to maintain a full-time program as described above. Occasionally, they may withdraw from a course if, because of reasons beyond their control, they cannot continue. Courses dropped during the first two weeks of the term will not appear on the transcript. Those dropped from the beginning of the third week through the end of the ninth week of the term will be recorded with a grade of W. After the ninth week, no one may withdraw from a course. Students who are ill or have a serious personal problem should see, call, or write to an adviser in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130.Complete Withdrawals Students who wish to withdraw from all courses in the current term must make an appointment for an interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center. If the student is unable to attend the College during the term following the withdrawal, he or she should discuss a leave of absence with an adviser in the College Advising Center. For more infor - mation, see \"leave of absence,\" below. Auditing Matriculated students in the College or in any division of the University (undergraduate or graduate) may audit (i.e., attend lectures without intending to receive credit) any course in the College with the consent of, and under the conditions established by, the in - structor and the department. Auditors may not preempt space required for registered students. Courses cannot be audited as a means of satisfying require - ments for an incomplete grade or as a means of changing a previous grade. A student cannot register as an auditor, and audited courses will not appear on the student's official transcript. Special (visiting, nondegree) students may not audit courses. 546 546 ATTENDANCE Although the administration of the College does not supervise attendance of classes, it supports the standards imposed by instructors. Students who, in the judgment of the instructor, have not substantially met the requirements of the course or who have been excessively absent may be considered to have withdrawn unoffi - cially and may be given the final grade of F. See \"withdrawing from courses,\" above. Religious Holidays and Attendance New York University, as a nonsectarian institution, adheres to the general policy of including in its official calendar only certain legal holidays. However, it has also long been University policy that members of any religious group may, without penalty, absent themselves from classes when compliance with their religious obligations requires it. In 1988, the University Senate affirmed this policy and passed a resolution that elaborated on it as follows: 1. Students who anticipate being absent because of any religious observance should, whenever possible, notify faculty in advance of such anticipated absence. 2. Whenever feasible, examinations and assignment deadlines should not be scheduled on religious holidays. Any student absent from class because of religious beliefs shall not be pe - nalized for any class, examination, or assignment deadline missed on that day or days. 3. If examinations or assignment dead - lines are scheduled, any student who is unable to attend class because of religious beliefs shall be given the opportunity to make up that day or days. 4. No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student who avails him - self or herself of the above provisions. General Leave If a student and an adviser agree that a leave of absence is the best way to proceed given the student's situation, the adviser will assist in the withdrawal from the semester and extended time for a leave of absence. A student needs to make an appointment with an adviser to discuss his or her particular situation and review the terms of the leave of absence; please contact the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. A student may request a leave of absence for the fall or spring semester, and must make his or her request prior to the end of the second week of the semester he or she wishes to be on leave. A student who requests a leave after that dead - line or who has been out of attendance without first being granted a leave must apply for readmission. Also note that leaves are not granted retroactively for past semesters.There are no leaves of absence for the summer and January terms, as enroll - ment during these terms is not required to maintain matriculation in the College. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon time (a maximum of two semesters during a student's academic career). Students who attend another college during the leave must petition to have the credits transferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions are filed through the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; cas.nyu.edu/academic-standards . Students are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship and financial aid award and should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 383 Lafayette Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted, they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmis - sion. (See the admission section of this Bulletin.) Psychological and Medical Leave If a student and a counselor or a physi - cian at the Student Health Center, 726 Broadway, agree that a psychological or medical leave of absence is the best way to proceed given the situation, the counselor or physician should make a recommendation to the Associate Dean for Students at the College for the with - drawal from the semester and extended time for a leave of absence. The student needs to complete the leave of absence petition form, which can be obtained at the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212- 998-8140. Leave of absence petitions LEAVE OF ABSENCE Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 547 547 are accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis throughout the academic year. On/about six (6) weeks prior to the first day of classes of the semester in which the student seeks to return, the student must have his or her counselor/therapist or physician complete a certification of readiness to return to school from a leave of absence form. The provider needs to state clearly that the student is ready to return and that NYU is a suit - able environment in which to continue his or her academic work. The student must also schedule an appointment with a counselor/therapist or physician at the Student Health Center, 726 Broadway, prior to receiving approval from the College to return. A student granted a leave does not have to make a formal application for readmission as long as he or she returns to the College within the agreed-upon time. Students on psychological or medical leave may want to take one or two courses at another institution to main - tain academic progress; if so, they must petition to have the credits trans - ferred after they have been approved to return to the College. Petitions are filed through the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; cas.nyu.edu/ academic-standards . Students are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship and financial aid award and should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 383 Lafayette Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted, they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See the admission section of this Bulletin.) Leave of Absence for Required Military Service International students whose home countries require students to perform two years of military service do not need to apply for readmission to the College of Arts and Science after a leave of absence for military service, provided they meet the following conditions: (1) they are on leave for just four regular (e.g., fall and spring) semesters and (2) they provide documentation of their military service during that time, accompanied by an English translation by accredited third-party translators. Students may not register for courses until the required documentation has been provided. Students who take a leave of absence for a military-related reason who fail to meet these conditions must apply for readmission with no guarantee of acceptance. A student needs to make an appoint - ment with an adviser to discuss his or her particular situation and review the terms of the leave of absence. Please contact the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Students are advised to inquire how the leave of absence may affect their scholarship and financial aid award and should contact the Office of Financial Aid at 383 Lafayette Street. If students are on probation when the leave is granted, they will return on probation. Students out of attendance who did not apply for a leave and who wish to return to the College must apply for readmission. (See the admission section of this Bulletin.) Credit for Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, A Level, and Other Examinations The College participates in the Advanced Placement Program of the College Entrance Examination Board. Students who have taken Advanced Placement exams while in high school should have the Educational Testing Service in Princ - eton, NJ, forward their official scores to NYU Undergraduate Admissions, 383 Lafayette Street, New York, NY 10003.No credit is given for AP tests taken after the completion of high school. In most subjects, if the score received is 4 or 5, credit will be granted. The AP credit will be lost, however, if a student takes the equivalent course for credit in the College. For more information, see the \"advanced placement equivalencies\" chart in the admission section of this Bulletin. For information on IB, A Level, and the other international examinations for which CAS awards credit (minimum scores, course equivalencies, etc.), please see \"credit by examination\" and charts in the admission section of this Bulletin. The maximum number of credits allowed toward the degree requirements of the College that are a result of any possible combination of nonresident special examination programs (plus previous coursework, if applicable and approved) shall not exceed a total of 32.CREDIT Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 548 548 College Credit Taken While in High School Credit may be awarded to students who have completed college courses while in high school (credits from either a community college or a four-year college or university are acceptable), provided that: they received a grade of \"B\" or better in the courses; an official transcript from the college or university is received; and corresponding courses are offered at NYU. These courses must be taken on a college/university campus with college/university students, and must be taught by a college/university faculty member; college courses taught in high schools by secondary school instructors are not acceptable. Also note that NYU does not grant credit for col - lege courses that are used to satisfy high school graduation requirements. Students who enter CAS as freshmen can be awarded a maximum of 32 advanced standing credits; this limit includes both credit from AP and other exams and previous college credit. Credit for Courses in the College To receive credit for a course, the student must register before attending, meet the requirements for attendance, and creditably complete all examina - tions and assignments prescribed by the instructor. For exceptional students, most departments also offer indepen - dent study. The College does not permit students to register as auditors. Restrictions on Receiving Credit (Including Course Repeat Policy) A student who has taken a course for credit or who has obtained a W in a course is permitted to repeat that course once. Students may not repeat more than two courses during their undergraduate careers. Students may not repeat courses in a designated sequence after taking more advanced courses. The departments determine the sequencing of courses. Students with questions regarding the repetition of courses or course sequences must consult with the particular department offering the course. When a student repeats a course, no additional credit will be awarded. Both grades will be recorded and computed in the grade point average. Courses that a student repeated before internally or externally transferring or transitioning into CAS do not count against the two-course limit. A limited number of credits may be earned by those in the military services who take correspondence courses in colleges approved by the United States Armed Forces Institute. Students may not be registered at another university at the same time that they are registered in the College of Arts and Science. Credit for Courses at Other Schools and Divisions of New York University Courses may be taken in the New York University Graduate School of Arts and Science. 1000-level graduate courses may be taken as described in the departmental sections of this bulletin, and 2000-level graduate courses may be taken with written approval of the instructor. If graduate courses are applied toward the completion of requirements for the baccalaureate degree, no advanced credit is allowed for them in the Graduate School of Arts and Science. It is also possible for students to take courses in other undergraduate divisions of New York University and to have credits for these courses applied to the degree in the College.Students may take a total of 16 points in other divisions, including any courses for particular minors approved by the College. Transfer students should note that credits for non-liberal-arts cours - es (e.g., business, applied art, speech) taken at another institution count as part of the 16 points. Students seeking ad - ditional non-liberal-arts credits beyond the 16-point limit must speak with their academic adviser in the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212- 998-8130. Some study away courses bearing the suffixes -AD/UH (NYU Abu Dhabi) and -SHU (NYU Shanghai) are approved not to count against each CAS student's 16-point allowance in the other schools of NYU. Please note that restrictions apply. Courses in other divisions that duplicate the contents of a College of Arts and Science course do not count toward the College degree. For details, students must check with an adviser in the Col - lege Advising Center before registering for any courses in other divisions. If a course is not approved, students will not receive credit for it. Independent study or internship courses taken in other divisions of the University do not count toward the College degree. If such courses are taken at schools outside the University, the credit will not transfer to the College. Also excluded from credit toward the degree are any courses taken in the School of Professional Studies, and/ or in the Liberal Studies Program, once a student is registered in the College. However, CAS students are allowed to take some specified advanced courses in Global Liberal Studies (GLS). Internal and external transfer students to the College must complete 64 credits in CAS (-UA) courses; courses taken in the other divisions and schools of NYU (icluding NYU Abu Dhabi and Shang - Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 549 549 hai) cannot count toward this 64-credit requirement. Summer Credits Once admitted to the College, students must take all courses here, including those they need or wish to take during the summer. Exceptions are granted only rarely and only for good academic reasons. Requests for a waiver should be made by submitting a petition to the Com - mittee on Undergraduate Academic Standards in the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; cas.nyu.edu/ academic-standards . Information about NYU summer course offerings is available during the preced - ing fall and spring terms, as is informa - tion about dormitory facilities available to students who usually commute. Credit for Independent Study Most departments offer independent study courses for students with excep - tional qualifications. In these courses, the work is planned specifically for each student. Independent study courses allow the student to work independently with faculty supervision and counsel. The courses typically carry variable credit of 2 or 4 points each term. They are normally limited to upper-class majors but may be open to other well-qualified students. To register for independent study, a student must ha77ve written approval of the director of undergradu - ate studies of the department in which the course is offered. The result of the independent study course should be a paper or objective, tangible evidence of completion of the work. The individ - ual departments may grant credit for not more than 8 points of independent study for work approved in advance. In general, students are not permitted to take more than 12 points of independent study and/or internship, and no more than 8 points may be taken in any one department. Internships and/or inde - pendent study courses taken in other divisions of the University or at other universities do not count toward the College degree. More specific information can be found under the individual departmental sections. Credit for Transfer Students Students are allowed to transfer up to 64 credits to the College and must present official college transcripts. Credits based on semester hours are accepted from other institutions at face value and are not altered when they are transferred into the College. Quarter hours will be converted to semester hours to determine the number of cred - its transferable to the College of Arts and Science. Non-liberal-arts credits are not always transferable, and transfer credit is never awarded for independent study or internship courses. Only credits for course work taken with a grade of C or better will be transferred. Courses taken for a pass/fail grade will not trans - fer to the College. Internal and external transfer students to the College must complete 64 credits in CAS (-UA) courses; courses taken in the other divisions and schools of NYU (including NYU Abu Dhabi and Shang - hai) cannot count toward this 64-credit requirement. Credit for Non-NYU Study Abroad Credits based on semester hours (similar to schools in the United States) are accepted from institutions abroad at face value and are not altered when the credits transfer into the College. Often credits from institutions abroad must be adjusted or converted to correspond to the College's requirements for award - ing credits. Approval to participate in a non-NYU study abroad is only obtained by completing an academic proposal. Petitions are filed through the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; cas.nyu.edu/academic-standards . When students receive approval to participate in a non-NYU program abroad, the specific courses they will take are approved and the number of transfer credits they will receive are specified. Credit for Online Courses CAS students can count up to four online courses (up to a total of 16 points) toward the baccalaureate degree. They can be taken in other NYU schools and/ or be applied as external transfer credit. No prior approval is needed to take an NYU online course. However, students must petition to transfer in external on - line courses. Petitions are filed through the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; cas.nyu.edu/academic- standards . Online courses cannot meet the require - ments of any CAS major or minor unless they are accepted and approved by the departmental director of undergraduate studies. Students may not register for online (or any) course in NYU's School of Professional Studies. Online credits from for-profit institutions are not accepted. Students must check the policies of graduate and professional schools they may plan to attend after graduation from NYU; not all programs will accept online credits. Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 550 550 EXAMINATIONS AND GRADES Missed and Makeup Examinations As noted under \"grades,\" below, a student who cannot take the final examination in a course at the regularly scheduled time may be given the grade of Incomplete. The student must discuss the reasons for missing the examination with the instructor and, in the case of illness, must submit a doctor's note to the instructor. The student must ask the instructor to give a grade of Incomplete. Incompletes are not awarded automati - cally. The time and place of any makeup examinations are set by the instructor or the department. Incomplete grades received because of a missed final examination must be removed within the semester following the one in which the Incomplete was received. In the case of students who are out of attendance, such grades must be removed within one year after the end of the course concerned. A grade of Incomplete that is not removed within this time limit becomes an F and is computed in the grade point average. (Regarding the removal of Incompletes received for missed work other than final examinations, see under \"grades\" and \"incompletes,\" below.) Grades Students may obtain their final grades for each semester on Albert via NYUHome. The parents or guardian of a student who is a minor (under 18 years of age) may, on a written request to the Office of the University Registrar, obtain the student's grades at any time. The following symbols indicating grades are used: A, B, C, D, P, F, NR, and W. The following symbol indicates incomplete work: I. Only grades of A, B, C, D, or F earned in any New York Universitycourse while matriculated in the College, or earned in any of the College's courses (courses suffixed by \"-UA\") while matric - ulated in another division of the Univer - sity, are computed in the average. The following grades may be awarded: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, F. In general, A indicates excellent work, B indicates good work, C indicates satisfactory work, and D indicates passable work and is the lowest passing grade. F indicates failure. By vote of the University Senate on March 29, 2018, the weights assigned in computing the grade point average are as follows, effective fall 2018 and thereafter. Grades and GPAs prior to fall 2018 will not change; for the pre-fall 2018 weighting of grades, please consult an archived CAS Bulletin. A = 4.000 A- = 3.667 B+ = 3.333 B = = = = = 1.333 D = 1.000 F = 0.000 Computing the Grade Point Average The grade point average can be obtained by determining the total of all grade points earned (quality points) and divid - ing that figure by the total number of credit hours completed (quality hours). For example (using the grade weighting in effect before fall 2018): A student who has completed 8 points of A (4.0), 4 points of B (3.0), and 4 points of C (2.0) has a grade point average of 3.25. This is obtained by adding 8 (points of A) x 4.0 (point value of A), 4 (points of B) x 3.0 (point value of B), and 4 (points of C) x 2.0 (point value of C), which totals 52 (the total of all grade points earned), and then by dividing 52 by 16 (the total number of credit hours completed). This gives the grade point average of 3.25. Policies on Assigned Grades Once a final grade has been submitted by the instructor and recorded on the transcript, the final grade cannot be changed by turning in additional course - work. Courses cannot be audited as a means of satisfying requirements for an incom - plete grade or as a means of changing a previous grade. To appeal an assigned grade, the student should first consult with the instructor who assigned the grade to discuss the grading requirements for the course and how the grade was determined. If the student is not satisfied with the outcome of the discussion and wishes to appeal the grade further, a formal written appeal should be submitted to the chair and/or director of undergrad - uate studies in the particular department. An independent review of the grade will be undertaken by the department. All of the student's work will be reviewed to clarify how the grade was determined and to ensure the grade is consistent with the academic guidelines and policies of the department. The decision of the department in matters related to a course grade is final. In the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who matriculated in CAS before fall 2012: only the second grade, whether higher or lower, is computed into the grade point average. The initial grade, however, remains on the transcript. Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 551 551 In the case of a course that has been repeated, for students who matricu - late in or are re-admitted to CAS in fall 2012 and thereafter: both grades will be recorded on the transcript and both grades will be computed in the grade point average. The grades for courses taken abroad in one of New York University's programs or at one of the exchange sites are recorded on the transcript and are also included in the grade point average. The grades for graduate and professional courses taken at other divisions in the University are included in the grade point average, provided that permission to enroll is obtained prior to registration for the courses. Not included in the undergraduate grade point average are grades for the first year of professional courses taken by those students in the three-year accel - erated dental program and grades for work done at institutions other than New York University (except for exchange sites abroad). Grade of P The grade of P (Pass) indicates a passing grade (A, B, C, or D) in a course taken under the pass/fail option. It is also used to indicate nongraded courses. The grade of P is not computed in the average. The grade of F under the pass/ fail option is computed in the average. For more information and procedures to obtain the Pass/Fail option, see the section \"pass/fail option,\" below. Grade of W The grade of W indicates an official withdrawal of the student from a course in good academic standing. Please see \"change of program\" and \"withdrawing from courses,\" above, for information on the regulations and procedures for withdrawing officially from courses.Grade of I The grade of I (Incomplete) is a tem - porary grade that indicates that the student has, for good reason, not completed all of the course work but that there is the possibility that the student will eventually pass the course when all of the requirements have been completed. A student must ask the instructor for a grade of I, present documented evidence of illness or the equivalent, and clarify the remaining course requirements with the instructor. The incomplete grade is not awarded automatically. It is not used when there is no possibility that the student will eventually pass the course. Courses can - not be audited as a means of satisfying requirements for an incomplete grade. If the course work is not completed after the statutory time for making up incompletes has elapsed, the temporary grade of I shall become an F and will be computed in the student's grade point average. Grade of NR Grades not entered by the course in - structor or academic department within 60 days from the grade deadline will lapse to NR (No Record). Courses with NR grades will not count toward earned credit and will not factor into the GPA, but will count as credits attempted and will impact academic progress evalu - ations used for financial aid eligibility. Students may not graduate with NR grades on their transcript without a formal documented exception approved by the CAS Office of the Associate Dean for Students. Incompletes All work missed in the fall term must be made up by the end of the follow - ing spring term. All work missed in the spring term or in a summer session must be made up by the end of the follow - ing fall term. Students who are out of attendance in the semester following the one in which the course was taken have one year to complete the work. Students should contact the College Advising Center (Silver Center, Room 905; 212- 998-8130) for an extension of Incom - plete form, which must be approved by the instructor. Extensions of these time limits are rarely granted. Pass/Fail Option Students may elect one Pass/Fail option each term, including the summer sessions, for a total of not more than 32 points during their college career. The Pass/Fail option is not acceptable for courses completed at other institutions. The choice must be made before the completion of the ninth week of the term (second week of a six-week sum - mer session); after that time, the deci - sion cannot be initiated or changed. No grade other than P or F will be recorded for those students choosing this option. P includes the grades of A, B, C, and D and is not counted in the average. F is counted in the average. The Pass/Fail option is not acceptable in the major, the minor, or any of the courses taken in fulfillment of the College Core Curriculum requirements. Students considering the Pass/Fail option in their area of study or in re - quired preprofessional courses should consult with their advisers about the effect of such grades on admission to graduate and professional schools. Students who change their majors may not be able to use courses taken under the Pass/Fail option to satisfy the requirements of their new majors. To declare the Pass/Fail option before the end of the ninth week of the semes - ter or the end of the second week of a six-week summer session, students must consult with an adviser in the College Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 552 552 Advising Center, Silver Center, 100 Washington Square East, Room 905; 212-998-8130. Advisers submit the request on students' behalf. Placement Examinations in Foreign Languages Most entering students take a place - ment test prior to their first registration in the College. Students who took a foreign-language SAT Subject test while in high school are encouraged to present the score instead of or in addition to taking the College's test. (Please consult the table on SAT subject exams and the College Core Curriculum in the admission section of this Bulletin.) Placement exams for the following languages are accessible online: Cantonese, French, German, Greek (modern), Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latin, Mandarin (traditional and simplified), Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Tagalog (Filipino). To take an exam, go to nyu.edu/cas/flpexam/ and follow the appropriate links. Online exams in these languages are for placement only, not exemption. Eligibility to take an in-person, paper exam for exemption from the CAS foreign language requirement is determined by a student's score on the online placement exam. Some languages do not have online placement exams and are only tested on paper: Gaelic (Irish), arranged through Ireland House; and Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Hindi, and Urdu, all arranged through the Department of Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies. These written exams result either in an exemption from the foreign language requirement (see \"foreign language\" under College Core Curriculum in this Bulletin) or in placement into the appropriate-level course. Whether online or written, these are reading examinations; students should choose to be tested in the language in which they have good reading skills. Placement into a lower-level course means that the student must continue his or her studies of that language (or begin a new language) until completion of the intermediate two level of that language. In some cases, adjustments in placement may be made during the first weeks of class. Students who place at a level below that which they have completed at another college will lose transfer credit if they repeat foreign language course work at the College of Arts and Science. A foreign language examination is required of all entering students with the following exceptions: students who will begin a language they have not pre - viously studied; students whose entire secondary schooling was in a language other than English; and those who com - plete the sequence of required Expos - itory Writing courses for international students. Students in these categories should contact the College Advising Center to verify that they have satisfied the foreign language requirement. Information on foreign language placement and exemption testing can be obtained from the Office of Academic Affairs, Silver Center, Room 908; 212-998-8110; cas.nyu.edu/ academic-programs/academic- support-services/placementexams .Placement Examinations in Calculus and Mathematics for Economics Students who intend to register for Calculus I (MATH-UA 121) or Mathematics for Economics I (MATH-UA 211) and do not meet any of the prerequisites listed in the mathematics section of this Bulletin must take a placement exam to determine their readiness to enter calculus. Students can also take placement exams to skip ahead in the Calculus I-II-III and Mathematics for Economics I-II-III sequences. Contact the Department of Mathematics, 251 Mercer Street; 212-998-3005; math.nyu.edu . Placement into Writing Courses for English as a Second Language Students In CAS, for most students, Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1) fulfills the College Core Curriculum writing requirement. Writing the Essay requires frequent analytical and reflective writing, which is common in other courses throughout NYU. The writing and reading assign - ments are challenging even for native speakers of English, and require them to develop conceptual frameworks for their arguments and ideas by working with a wide range of sophisticated and complex sources at a pace comfortable for most native speakers. NYU recognizes that international students come with varying levels of language competency and fluency and require more time to complete challenging reading and writing assign -PLACEMENT EXAMINATIONS, DEGREE PROGRESS, AND TRANSCRIPTS Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 553 553 ments. For international students, there are alternate pathways to satisfying the Core writing requirement. 1) International students who attended English-language high schools for four years may be uncertain about the default placement into Writing the Essay (EXPOS-UA 1). For those students, an option is placement within the Inter - national Writing sequence, beginning with International Writing Workshop 1 (EXPOS-UA 4), followed by International Writing Workshop 2 (EXPOS-UA 9). The expectations for International Writing Workshop 1 and 2 are the same as for Writing the Essay, but the classes are smaller and there is more time (two semesters) to complete the curriculum. For help determining whether Writ - ing the Essay or International Writing Workshop 1 is the better choice for international students who attended English-language high schools, please visit the Expository Writing Program webpage: ewp.cas.nyu.edu . 2) International students who did not attend English-language high schools for four years are asked to take a survey designed to determine appropriate placement. Based on their survey re - sponses, these students may be placed into International Writing Workshop: Introduction (EXPOS-UA 3), which is followed by International Writing Workshop I (EXPOS-UA 4) and then by International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9). The preliminary course, International Writing Workshop: Introduction, is taught in an environ - ment where gaining fluency in reading, writing, and speaking in English is an expected part of the coursework, and offers the international student more time and support for reading, writing, and speaking. It is possible for students in International Writing Workshop: Introduction to be reevaluated at the end of the course for possible waiver of International Writing Workshop I (EXPOS-UA 4) and direct placement into International Writing Workshop II (EXPOS-UA 9). For questions about survey results, please consult with your adviser and the survey team: ewp-writingsurvey@nyu.edu . Degree Progress Report All students have access to their degree progress report, as generated by the Office of the University Registrar, on Albert via NYUHome. It is located in the Academics section of the Student Center. The degree progress report is a Student Information System (SIS) accounting of completed and remaining degree requirements. Transcripts of Record Unofficial transcripts are available on Albert, NYU's Web-based registration and information system. Albert can be accessed via NYUHome. Students requiring a stamped and sealed copy of their New York Univer - sity records should request an official copy of their University transcript from the Office of the University Registrar. Requests for official transcripts require the signature of the student/alumnus requesting the transcript, unless the student/alumnus has a valid NetID. Current students and graduates with a valid NYU NetID (able to access NYUHome/Albert ) who attended NYU in or after 1990 can request an official transcript from the Albert Student Center. The Official Transcript link can be found under the Grades & Transcripts section of the Student Center. Alumni who attended NYU prior to 1990 and have a valid NetID can go to the secure online transcript request form and log in with their NetID and password. A signed consent form is not required.Before completing their transcript request, current students should check to ensure that all their grades have been posted. Recent graduates should check to ensure that their degree has been recorded. Any transcript request that requires any special handling must go through the secure online transcript request form (nyu.edu/registrar/transcript-form ) and cannot be requested on Albert. Special handling includes: (1) sending transcripts by express mail; (2) tran - scripts sent to the student or alumnus/a in separate sealed envelopes addressed to admissions offices of other universities; (3) including additional documents to be sent along with the NYU transcript.

To graduate in a specific semester, students must apply for graduation within the application deadline period indicated on the calendar available at the Office of the University Registrar's web page. It is recommended that students apply for graduation no later than the beginning of the semester in which they plan to complete all pro - gram requirements. Students who do not successfully complete all academic requirements by the end of that semes - ter must reapply for graduation for the following cycle. ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND DISCIPLINE Academic Standards The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards reviews student records throughout the academic year. All of its actions are based on the grades to date at the end of the term. Academic Alert Students with cumulative grade point averages of 2.0 to 2.25 will receive an academic alert letter reflecting the committee's specific recommendations for achieving an appropriate standard for academic performance. Academic Probation Any student whose record is deemed unsatisfactory will be placed on academ - ic probation and will be so informed by email. A record will be deemed unsatisfactory if, in any semester, the cumulative or semester grade point average falls below 2.0 or if it fails to show steady and substantial progress toward the degree. Steady and substan - tial progress toward the degree entails the completion, with satisfactory grades, of more than half of the courses (and points) for which a student registers in any semester. In addition, it entails satisfactory progress in the student's major. Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 555 555 Failure to satisfy the conditions of probation will result in further academic sanctions and possibly dismissal from the College. The conditions usually require that the student, within the next 16 points of coursework, (a) achieve a grade point average of at least 2.0 during the term he or she is on probation, (b) not receive any grade below a C or any grade of I, and (c) not withdraw from any course without securing the permission of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards prior to the withdrawal. Students on academic probation are also required to have a special probation interview with an adviser in the College Advising Center to receive registration clearance for the next semester. More specific requirements may be imposed. The Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards may summon students with unsatisfactory records to discuss their problems and to determine whether and under what conditions they may continue in the College. In special circumstances, the committee may recommend to the dean that students may be granted or placed on leave for a period not to exceed two semesters. Students on academic probation may not engage in any extracurricular ac - tivities (except for departmental clubs) and may not hold office in these clubs without the approval of the Committee on Undergraduate Academic Standards. Students on academic probation should be aware that they are usually ineligible for financial aid. Academic Dismissal Students who are dismissed from the College for poor academic performance will be informed via e-mail. Students who have paid tuition for the next term at the time of dismissal will receive a full refund of tuition and fees.Academic Integrity Community of the Mind The College is a \"community of the mind.\" Its students, faculty, and staff all share the goal of pursuing truth through free and open inquiry, and we support one another's endeavors in this regard. As in any community, membership comes with certain rights and responsibilities. Foremost among these is academic integrity. Cheating on an exam, falsifying data, or having someone else write a paper undermines others who are \"doing it on their own\"; it makes it difficult or impossible to assess fairly a student's interest, apti - tude, and achievement; and it diminishes the cheater, depriving him or her of an education. Most important, academic dishonesty is a violation of the very principles upon which the academy is founded. For this reason, violations of these principles are treated with the utmost seriousness. College of Arts and Science Honor Code As a student in the College of Arts and Science at New York University, you belong to a community of scholars who value free and open inquiry. Honest assessment of ideas and their sources is the foundation of what we do. Our University is a community of mutual trust and respect in which personal prejudice has no part in the critical evaluation of ideas. It is a place where differences of opinion can be subjected to deliberate and reasonable examina - tion without animus. As scholars, it is therefore as a matter of honor and good repute that we each commit ourselves to assuring the integrity of our academ - iccommunity and of the educational pursuits we undertake together. As a student in the College, I pledge that: I shall perform honestly all my academ - ic obligations. I will not represent the words, works, or ideas of others as my own; will not cheat; and will not seek to mislead faculty or other academic officers in their evaluation of my course work or in any other academic affairs. I shall behave with decorum and civility, and with respectful regard for all members of the University\u2014faculty, staff, and fellow students\u2014our guests, and members of our wider communi - ties. I shall abide by the College and by the University rules of conduct and policies on academic integrity and by the special requirements of any individual course of study or other academic activity. I shall endeavor earnestly to uphold the values, standards, and ideals on which our University community depends and call on others to do so. Discipline: College of Arts and Science Rules and Procedures on Student Misconduct Effective August 12, 2018, allegations of non-academic misconduct, as outlined in the University Student Conduct Policy, against a student of the College of Arts and Science, shall be addressed pursu - ant to the procedures set forth in the NYU Student Conduct Procedures and administered by the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards under the authority of the Senior Vice President of Student Affairs. Allegations of academic misconduct (plagiarism, cheating, etc.) against a student of the College of Arts and Science shall con - tinue to be addressed by the school in accordance with established procedures. Approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science, April 30, 2015 New York University is a community of scholars who value free and open inqui - ry. Our work depends on honest assess - ment of ideas and their sources; and we expect all members of our community Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 556 556 to maintain the highest integrity in their academic work. As scholars committed to the critical evaluation of ideas, free of personal prejudice, we also have an obligation to one another to create an educational atmosphere of mutual trust and respect in which differences of opinion can be subjected to deliberate and reasonable examination without animus. Because of the central impor - tance of these values to our intellectual life together, students who fail to main - tain them will be subject to disciplinary sanction, which may include dismissal from the University. Disciplinary offenses include but are not limited to: cheating, plagiarism, falsification of data or sources, forgery of academic documents in attempt to defraud; destruction, theft, or unauthorized use of laboratory data, library or research materials, computer resources, or university property; disruption of academic events or interference with access to classrooms, laboratories, or academic offices; actual or threatened violence against, or assault or harassment of a student, instructor, staff member, or administrator. The following penalties may be imposed by the faculty for disciplinary infractions: Warning Disciplinary Probation Suspension Dismissal Complete statements of the rules and procedures for adjudicating disciplinary complaints concerning students in the College are available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students and on the website of the College of Arts and Science.Rules and Procedures 1. General Principles a) Student conduct that violates the College of Arts and Science Hon - or Code, University-wide student conduct policies, and/ or student conduct policies established by portal cam-puses, global academic sites, or administrative offices of the Uni - versity may be subject to disciplinary action in accordance with established CAS and University procedures. b) Student misconduct includes aca - demic misconduct, such as plagiarism, cheating, and possession of or use of any prohibited notes, reference resources, or data processing or other devices in any class or examination; and behavioral misconduct, such as forgery of academic documents in attempt to defraud; destruction, misuse, or theft of University resourc - es; disruption of classes or other academic events, or University admin - istrative operations; acts of violence; and assault and harassment. c) In cases of academic misconduct, evaluation of the student's academic performance is distinguished from disciplinary adjudication of the offense. The question of what grade the student's work should earn is distinct from that about whether a disciplinary sanction should also be imposed. When a student is found to have engaged in academic miscon - duct, the instructor may reduce the student's grade for the assignment or for the course as a whole; however, such a determination is an academic judgment made by the instructor in accord with the expectations of the department or program offer - ing the course and is not a form of disciplinary sanction. The question of whether a disciplinary sanction should also be imposed is separate from this academic determination, as specified in the procedures described herein. 2. Academic Misconduct\u2014 Academic Review a) When it is believed that violations of academic integrity may have oc - curred it is within the discretion of the faculty member to address the matter informally with the student should the infraction be judged insubstantial or should the evidence be inconclusive. In such cases the faculty member may determine that no grade reduction is warranted. b) Should the faculty member judge the violation substantial and well supported by the evidence, he or she may, with the assent of the Director of Undergraduate Studies (or, if the Director of Undergraduate Studies is the instructor, with the chair or another academic director in the department or program, or if the department or program should be too small, in an ad hoc consultation with a chair or academic director of another department or program from the same academic division) reduce the student's grade or assign the student a failing grade for the assignment in question or for the course as a whole. This grade reduc - tion only reflects the student's failure creditably to complete the academic requirements in question and is not a disciplinary sanction. The grade reduction should be proportional to the size and weight of the incident of academic misconduct among all requirements for the course and appropriate to the level at which the course is offered. Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 557 557 c) In order to better educate the student about the CAS standards for academic integrity, the faculty member and/or the Director of Undergraduate Studies should meet with the student to discuss the nature of the offense and the action taken. This responsibility of the faculty should not be delegated to recitation or laboratory instructors or other course assistants. d) For incidents of academic misconduct, the student's appeal of the grade reduction is limited to departmental review conducted by the Director of Undergraduate Studies and/or the Department Chair, as specified in the CAS policy for grade appeals. The review will be limited to the question of whether the reduction in grade was made fairly and in keeping with the expectations of the department or program. e) The decision of the department or program on the student's appeal is final. 3. Academic Misconduct\u2014Reporting and Disciplinary Referral a) In all instances in which there has been a finding that a CAS student committed a sub-stantial violation of academic integrity standards of CAS or of any of its departments or pro - grams, the Director of Undergraduate Studies will inform the student within seven (7) calendar days in writing and/or via email of any action taken and send copies of this letter to the CAS Associate Dean for Students, the faculty member, and the Department Chair or Program Director. The letter will include the nature of the violation, any resulting reduction in grade, and notice of the student's right to appeal. A copy of the correspondence and the evidence of the violation shall be kept in a confidential file maintained by the Director of Undergraduate Studies.b) The Director of Undergraduate Studies will also within seven (7) calendar days inform the CAS Associ - ate Dean for Students in writing and/ or via email of the student's violation, forward to the dean the evidence of the violation, and send a copy of the correspondence to the faculty mem - ber and to the Department Chair or Program Director. c) If this is the student's first incident of academic misconduct, the Associate Dean for Students will send the stu - dent a warning letter indicating that a suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second academic integrity offense of any kind. d) If this is the student's second or fur - ther incident of academic misconduct, the Associate Dean for Students will meet with the student, discuss the evidence of academic misconduct, and provide the student an opportu - nity to respond. The student will be informed of his or her right to accept or reject a resolution by the Associate Dean. After considering all relevant information, the Associate Dean may offer the student terms upon which CAS is willing to resolve the matter, which may include imposition of a disciplinary sanction. Where the stu - dent and the Associate Dean agree to terms in writing, a binding consensual resolution will exist between the stu - dent and CAS. Where the Associate Dean is unable to resolve the complaint by consensual resolution, the matter will be referred to the Committee on Student Discipline. e) In all instances in which there has been a finding that a non-CAS student committed a substantial violation of academic integrity standards of CAS or of any of its departments or programs, the Direc - tor of Undergraduate Studies will proceed in accord with the proce -dures under (a) and (b), except that notice will be made instead to the Dean of Students of the student's school. 4. Behavioral Misconduct a) Complaints of student behavioral misconduct should be made in writ - ing to the CAS Associate Dean for Students. When such a complaint is received, the Associate Dean will notify the student of the complaint and investigate the matter. In cases of students who have transferred internally among divisions of the University, the dean will query the student's prior school(s) concerning their disciplinary records for the student, if any. b) The Associate Dean of Students will meet with the student against whom the complaint has been filed, describe the complaint, and offer the student an opportunity to respond. The student will be informed of his or her right to accept or reject a resolution by the Associate Dean. After con - sidering all relevant information, the Associate Dean may offer the student terms upon which CAS is willing to resolve the matter, which may include imposition of a disciplinary sanction. Where the student and the Associ - ate Dean agree to terms in writing, a binding consensual resolution will exist between the student and CAS. Where the Associate Dean is unable to resolve the complaint by consen - sual resolution, the matter will be referred to the Committee on Student Discipline. c) Ordinarily, if the misconduct is a student's first offense at the Univer - sity and does not warrant further disciplinary sanction, the student will be offered the opportunity to continue in CAS under written warning that a one-semester suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 558 558 second disciplinary offense of any kind. Discipline: Definitions of Sanctions Approved by the Faculty of Arts and Science, April 21, 2014 Warning: Written reprimand, including notice that a one-semester suspension or a more severe penalty may result from a second disciplinary offense within the period of the censure specified in the letter of reprimand. Disciplinary Probation: Suspension of privileges or exclusion from participation in extracurricular University activities as set forth in the notice of disciplinary probation for a specified period of time. Suspension: Exclusion from classes as well as suspension of privileges and exclusion from other activities as set forth in the notice of suspension for a definite period of time. A student who has been suspended and against whom charges are dismissed or not sustained will be allowed full opportunity to make up whatever work was missed due to the suspension. Dismissal: Termination of student status for an indefinite period. The conditions for readmission, if any are permitted, will be stated in the order of dismissal. Student Grievance Students in the College of Arts and Science are referred to the \"student grievance procedure\" applicable to all the schools of New York University as found in the NYU Students' Guide. The College adheres to all articles of the \"student grievance procedure\" as set forth in the \"University Policies and Procedures\" section of the NYU Student's Guide. PETITIONS UNIVERSITY POLICIES AND CAMPUS SAFETYThe Faculty Committee on Undergrad - uate Academic Standards will consider petitions from students to waive requirements or modify policies and regulations of the College. Students should be aware that only very excep - tional cases, supported by valid and documented reasons, will be considered. After deliberation, the committee's decisions on such matters are final. Petitions are filed through the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909; 212-998-8140; cas.nyu.edu/academic-standards . University Policy on Patents Students offered research opportunities are reminded that inventions arising from participation in such research are governed by the University's \"statement of policy on patents,\" a copy of which may be found in the Faculty Handbook or obtained from the dean's office. Immunization Requirements New York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2165 requires all students registering for 6 or more credits in a degree-granting program to provide immunization documentation for measles (rubeola), mumps, and rubella (German measles) prior to registration. Students born before January 1, 1957, are exempt. New students should com - plete the MMR section of the student health history form. Continuing students should complete and submit a student immunization record form. New York State Public Health Law (NYS PHL) 2167 requires that all students registered for 6 or more credits submit a meningitis response form as formal confirmation of their decision as to whether or not to be immunized with the meningococcal (meningitis) vaccine. New students should complete the meningitis response section of the student health history form. Continuing students should complete and submit a meningitis response form.Failure to comply with state immuni - zation laws will prevent NYU students from registering for classes. In addition to these requirements, the NYU Stu - dent Health Center recommends that students also consider hepatitis B and varicella immunizations. Students should discuss immunization options with their primary care provider. Bias Response Line The New York University Bias Response Line provides a mechanism through which members of our community can share or report experiences and concerns of bias, discrimination, or harassing behavior that may occur within our Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 559 559 community. Instances of such behavior may be reported by telephone, 212-998- 2277; by email, bias.response@nyu. edu; or via an online form. Experienced administrators in the Office of Equal Opportunity receive and assess reports, and then help facilitate responses, which may include referral to another Univer - sity school or unit, or investigation if warranted according to the University's existing Non-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy. Campus Safety The Department of Public Safety is located at 7 Washington Place; tele - phone: 212-998-2222; 212-998-2220 (TTY). New York University's annual campus security report includes statistics for the previous three years concerning reported crimes that occurred on campus, in certain off-campus buildings or property owned or controlled by NYU, and on public property within or immediately adjacent to the campus. The report also includes institutional policies concerning campus security, such as policies concerning sexual assault, drugs, and alcohol. Students may obtain a copy of the current report by contacting Thomas Grace, Director of Judicial Affairs and Compliance, Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs (601 Kimmel Center: 212-998-4403), or Jay Zwicker, Crime Prevention Manager, Department of Public Safety (7 Wash - ington Place: 212-998-1451), or by visiting the following website: nyu. edu/public.safety/policies . New York University Weapons Policy New York University strictly prohibits the possession of all weapons, as described in local, state, and federal statutes, including, but not limited to, firearms, knives, and explosives, in and/or around any and all University facilities\u2014academ - ic, residential, or others. This prohibition extends to all buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the University, regardless of whether the bearer or pos - sessor is licensed to carry that weapon. The possession of any weapon has the potential of creating a dangerous situa - tion for the bearer and others. The only exceptions to this policy are duly authorized law enforcement personnel who are performing official federal, state, or local business and instances in which the bearer of the weapon is licensed by an appropriate licensing authority and has received written permission from the executive vice president of the University. New York University Simulated Firearm Policy New York University strictly prohibits simulated firearms in and/or around any and all University facilities\u2014academic, residential, or other. This prohibition extends to all buildings\u2014whether owned, leased, or controlled by the University. The possession of a simulated firearm has the potential of creating a danger - ous situation for the bearer and others. The only exceptions to this policy are instances in which (1) the bearer is in possession of written permission from a dean, associate dean, assistant dean, or department head and (2) such pos - session or use of simulated firearms is directly connected to a University- or school-related event (e.g., play, film production). Whenever an approved simulated firearm is transported from one location to another, it must be placed in a secure container in such a manner that it cannot be observed. Storage of approved simulated firearms shall be the responsibility of the Depart - ment of Public Safety in a locationdes - ignated by the vice president for public safety. Under no circumstances, other than at a Public Safety storage area, may approved simulated firearms be stored in any University-owned, -leased, or -controlled facilities. Academic Policies / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Honors and Awards / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22Honors and Awards 560 Matriculated students with superior academic records are honored in various ways, such as by placement on the Dean's Honors List, election to honor societies, and admission to departmental honors programs. Additional information may be obtained from departmental advisers and from the College Advising Center, Silver Center, Room 905; 212-998-8130. HONORS Dean's Honors List A Dean's Honors List is compiled at the end of each academic year, in June. This is an honors roll of matriculated students who have achieved an average of 3.65 or higher for that academic year (Sep - tember to May) in at least 28 graded points. To be listed, a student must not have any grades of Incomplete or N at the time the list is compiled. Note that grade point averages are carried to two decimal places (but are not rounded off). Honorary Societies in Arts and Science Any student seeking to join a depart - mental scholastic honorary society is required to maintain, as a minimum scholastic requirement for election to membership, a general average of 3.50, as well as an average in the major subject of 3.50. Students should consult with departmental advisers in regard to the specific requirements for the various departmental honor societies. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa celebrates and advocates excellence in the liberal arts and sciences, and the Phi Beta Kappa Society invites for induction the most outstanding arts and science students in America's leading colleges and universities. NYU's College of Arts and Science chapter, the Beta of New York, was established in 1858. In terms of seniority, it ranks as the 15th oldest chapter of the Society. Each April, the faculty members of the Beta chapter automatically review the academic performance of all students in the College for eligibility for election to Phi Beta Kappa. Eligibility for Graduation with Latin Honors To be graduated with honors, a student must have at least 64 points earned in courses from CAS, GSAS, and selected Tisch departments. All graded courses taken while enrolled either in the College or in another school of NYU will be used in computing the grade point average on which Latin honors are based, as long as the 64-point residency requirement is met. Pass (P) grades are not counted; grades received in courses taken at other institutions are also not counted. The student must also have a clean record of conduct. Effective with the September 2008 graduating class, the GPA cutoffs for each category are determined by the combined GPA distribution from the preceding academic year, all graduation moments included. The cutoff for summa cum laude is the GPA included within the top 5 percent of the previous year's graduating class. The cutoff for magna cum laude is the GPA included within the next 10 percent of the previous year's class. The cutoff for cum laude is the GPA included within the next 15 percent of the previous year's class. For exam - ple, the necessary GPA level for summa cum laude for students graduating in September 2008 will be based on the GPA cutoff for the top 5 percent of the combined graduates from September 2007, January 2008, and May 2008. Departmental Honors Students who have completed at least 64 points of graded work in the College may be awarded degrees with depart - mental honors if they complete the designated honors sequence in a depart - ment and maintain the requisite grade point average. There are two levels: honors and high honors. Students seeking admission to and graduation with departmental honors are expected to have a minimum grade point average of 3.65, both overall and in the major. Departments may exercise some flexibility: in rare cases where a candidate for admission to a depart - mental honors program falls short of the expected minimum GPA, the director of undergraduate studies or the director 561 561 of departmental honors may petition the director of college honors for an exception. In all cases, once admitted, students are expected to maintain the GPA at the stipulated level in order to graduate with departmental honors. Should there be an exceptional circum - stance in which the stipulated GPA is not maintained, the director of college hon - ors may be petitioned for an exception. If the case is compelling, the latter will inform the registrar's office of the waiver. Honors programs must, minimally, be a two-term (8-point) experience that includes a capstone research project. The capstone project, which typically culminates in a thesis, should reflect sustained original research over two semesters. The scope and length of a thesis will vary by discipline, but the the - sis is typically 40 to 60 pages in length. All students completing departmental honors must make public presentations of their work, preferably at the CAS Undergraduate Research Conference (URC) held at the end of the academic year, or in a departmental forum (e.g., oral defenses or presentations) held in conjunction with the URC. Students with double majors in discrete, unrelated disciplines must complete honors programs in each major for which they seek honors. Students with double majors in interdisciplinary or related fields may, if the two depart - ments concur, convene a joint honors committee to establish an interdisci - plinary research program of course work that culminates in a single thesis. Similarly, in the case of joint majors, the relevant departments must work out an agreement on the requirements for honors and on the supervision and eval - uation of students' theses or projects. Presidential Honors Scholars Membership in the Presidential Honors Scholars at the College of Arts and Science offers outstanding students the opportunity to receive special advising from College faculty and staff, to chal - lenge themselves in honors courses and through independent research, to study away, to take advantage of New York City's cultural resources, and to develop leadership skills through community service. Scholars comprise a distin - guished group of undergraduates; only the top 10 percent of the entering class are chosen, and students who apply for entry after they have matriculated must demonstrate not only superlative aca - demic achievements but also a consistent record of leadership and service to the community. First-year students appointed on the basis of their high school records participate in a Scholars Seminar. They meet regularly for lectures and discus - sions and participate in a wide variety of cocurricular activities. These include the Scholars Lecture Series, cultural events in the city, social events, and community service projects. During the January intersession, first-year scholars travel with faculty mentors to NYU Florence, Italy. Sophomore scholars also participate in a trip abroad, choosing a destination that most closely relates to their aca - demic or personal interests. During their junior or senior year, scholars spend an entire semester (or year) studying at one of NYU's programs or exchanges away. In their junior and senior years, they also enroll in the honors track of their chosen major. In addition, Presidential Honors Scholars are committed to volunteering and serving in the community. Membership in the scholars program is renewable annually, depending on the quality of the scholar's academic records and his or her level of participation in the program. All scholars are expected to be full-time students and maintain a grade point average of at least 3.65. Students who are not designated as Presidential Honors Scholars for the first-year stu -dents are invited to apply for member - ship at the end of the spring semester. Further information is available from the Office of the Associate Dean for Students, Silver Center, Room 909 (212-998-8140) or from the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, 383 Lafay - ette Street, 2nd Floor (212-998-4550). Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program Since its inception in 1987, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Scholars Program has awarded over 400 need-based and merit scholarships to incoming first-year students at NYU. These students pres - ent records of outstanding academic achievement, leadership, and commit - ment to the principles of community service, humanitarianism, and social progress. MLK Scholars help to plan and participate in academic and cultural events that draw on the vast resources of New York University and New York City. They explore cultural diversity through domestic and international travel and take the lead in helping others through community service. Women in Science Program The Women in Science (WINS) program seeks to cultivate the talents of women undergraduates who are interested in careers that focus on research in science and math. A core group of undergradu - ate women, WINS Scholars, apply and are selected after the first year based on high academic achievement and a demonstrated interest in research and a career in science. WINS aims to nurture the talents of its members through an individualized program of study, research, and mentoring. The goal is to provide the foundation for lifelong success in professional and academic careers that involve research in anthro - pology, biochemistry, biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, mathe - Honors and Awards / NYU College of Arts & Science / 2020-22 562 562 matics, neural science, physics, or psychology. WINS scholars meet regularly as a group, offer peer support to each other, meet with instructors and women scien - tists invited to address the group, and host events that enable them to meet eminent scientists from STEM fields. The WINS faculty director acts to facil - itate mentor relationships with women researchers at NYU. WINS scholars also raise awareness on campus of the enor - mous contribution women have made to the sciences. WINS scholars benefit from annual scholarship funds. Lewis Rudin City Scholars Rudin Scholars are outstanding entering first-year students selected from public and parochial high schools in all five boroughs of New York City. In addition to their scholarship, the scholars partic - ipate in academic and cultural activities in New York City. The program is named in honor of the late real estate developer Lewis Rudin, former president of the Association for a Better New York and an NYU alumnus and trustee.

In addition to the satisfaction they receive in helping their neighbors, they also gain valuable work experience. Through NYU's Office of Community Engagement, students volunteer with dozens of nonprofit organizations throughout New York City. Community service provides an oppor - tunity to address major social, health, hunger, and environmental issues. Through service, students enhance their leadership skills, find fulfillment in giving back something to the community, and build new relationships while learning more about themselves. There are many ways to become involved in activities on and off campus. Students in the College collect canned goods, conduct toy drives, and distribute bag lunches to the homeless. They work in dropout-prevention programs that encourage high school students to stay in school. They renovate houses and make them livable again. Students in the Presidential Scholars Program participate in ongoing service projects such as the Dean's Service Honor Corps, the Univer - sity Settlement House, the Door, and the Beacon House. Regardless of the project or partner organization, student volun - teers give of themselves freely. And they all agree that they get back much more than they give. Students selected for the Presidential Honors Scholars program in the College of Arts and Science have the opportuni - ty to apply for the Dean's Service Honor Corps. The Honor Corps makes a special commitment to community service and assumes a leadership role in promoting service in the College. This group of qualified scholars works with the dean on a weekly community-service project. Many student clubs and organizations, such as Asian Initiative and Fraternity and Sorority Life, sponsor special service projects and philanthropic events throughout the year. To find out more about becoming involved, contact Fra - ternity and Sorority Life (212-998-4700). In addition to clubs and organizations, the Center for Student Life sponsors Alternative Breaks, nontraditional winter or spring vacations in which students participate in a weeklong community service project. Another option available to students is OutReach, a volunteer corps that introduces freshmen to service in New York City (212-998-4700). The NYU Office of Community Engage - ment (212-998-2400) provides students with information about service opportu - nities. Hundreds of volunteer positions are on file in this office. Personnel are available to provide advice and support, Monday to Friday, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The office also sponsors special events and welcomes organizations to post volunteer positions.

Tenured/Tenure-Track Faculty Senators (T-FSC) Function: To represent the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS) tenured/tenure- track faculty in the University Senate and the Faculty Council of New York University. The Senate is the deliberative body of the University and is empowered to act on \"educational matter and regu - lations of the academic community that affect more than one school.\" The T-FSC is established by the University Bylaws, and may consider, inter alia, any matters of educational and administrative policy. The T-FSC functions as the tenured/ tenure-track faculty personnel committee of the Senate, and in this capacity, it is charged with considering any and all University-wide matters pertaining to tenured/tenure-track faculty. The FAS T-FSC shall report on the activities of the Senate and FSC to the FAS at its scheduled FAS Full Faculty meetings. The FAS Tenured/Tenure-Track Faculty Senators shall also meet as a body separate from the general NYU Senate (with or without the Dean of FAS) to discuss matters of importance to FAS in accord with the Faculty's fulfillment of its proper role in the governance of NYU. They must report back at least once per semester to the Policy and Planning Committee and the full faculty, through electronic communications. Composition: The number of tenured/ tenure-track senators allotted to each academic component of the University is based on the number of faculty in each component. For the election of FAS Tenured/Tenure-Track Faculty Senators to be valid at least three candidates must run for each open seat (e.g. for three open positions there would be a minimum of nine candidates). In any election year, candidates receiving the most votes are elected as Senators, and those with fewer votes are elected as Alternate Senators in sequential order. For example, if three Senators and three Alternate Senators are to be elected, the individuals receiving the most, second most, and third most votes will become Senators, and the individual receiving the fourth most votes will become an Alternate Senator for the Senator that received the most votes, the individ - ual receiving the fifth most votes will become an Alternate Senator for the Senator that received the second most votes, and so on. The Alternate Senators will serve in place of their respective Senators in the event that their Senator is on leave or unable to fulfill his/her duties. It is not necessary that a Senator and the respective Alternate Senator belong to the same academic division. An Alternate Senator can run for a position as Senator in a subsequent election. If elected, a new Alternate Senator will be selected based on the protocol outlined above.Term: Three Years. Structure: Tenured/Tenure-Track Faculty Senators and Alternates are elected from and by the tenured/tenure-track faculty, as stipulated by and in accor - dance with University Bylaws, with staggered terms such that roughly one third of the representatives are elected each year. Elections are held prior to May 1 and the names of the representa - tive transmitted to the Secretary of the Senate within five days. The Senators of the T-FSC shall elect one of their members annually to serve on the Advisory Committee on Policy and Planning. Full-Time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators (C-FSC) Function: To represent the Faculty of Arts and Science (FAS) continuing contract faculty in the University Senate and the Faculty Council of New York University. The Senate is the deliberative body of the University and is empowered to act on \"educational matter and regu - lations of the academic community that affect more than one school.\" The C-FSC is established by the University Bylaws, and may consider, inter alia, any matters of educational and administrative policy. The C-FSC functions as the full-time continuing contract faculty personnel committee of the Senate, and in this capacity, it is charged with considering any and all University-wide matters per - taining to full-time continuing contract faculty. The FAS C-FSC shall 602 602 report on the activities of the Senate and C-FSC to the FAS at its scheduled FAS Full Faculty meetings. The FAS Continuing Contract Faculty Senators shall also meet as a body separate from the general NYU Senate (with or without the Dean of FAS) to discuss matters of importance to FAS in accord with the Faculty's fulfillment of its proper role in the governance of NYU. They must report back at least once per semester to the Policy and Planning Committee and the full faculty, through electronic communications. Composition: The number of continuing contract senators allotted to each aca - demic component of the University is based on the number of faculty in each component. For the election of FAS Full-time Continuing Contract Faculty Senators to be valid at least three candi - dates must run for each open seat (e.g. for three open positions there would be a minimum of nine candidates). In any election year, candidates receiving the most votes are elected as Senators, and those with fewer votes are elect - ed as Alternate Senators in sequential order as described above for the T-FSC, except that there can at any time be no more than two serving Senators from a single Department or Program, and no more than two serving Alternates from a single Department or Program. The Alternate Senators will serve in place of their respective Senators in the event that their Senator is on leave or unable to fulfill his/her duties. It is not neces - sary that a Senator and the respective Alternate Senator belong to the same academic division. An Alternate Senator can run for a position as Senator in a subsequent election.
