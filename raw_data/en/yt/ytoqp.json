Healing Nature Acupuncture & Herbal Medicine.", "sitename": "Healing Nature Acupu", "date": "2016-01-01", "cleaned_text": "then you will understand everything better\" -Albert Einstein One of the fundamental concepts of Traditional Chinese Medicine is an emphasis on being in tune with one's external environment and following the ways and rhythms of nature. The healing power of nature and plants is utilized through herbal medicine. Acupuncture aims to balance the body and its systems so that it can heal itself. Healing Nature Acupuncture & Herbal Medicine offers a holistic and natural approach to healthcare and well-being in New Orleans. Meet Dr. Kate (she/they) Acupuncturist, Herbalist I value the natural world and maintaining a connection with it. I appreciate that Chinese Medicine offers natural methods to heal the body, mind, and spirit. I enjoy working with all ages, from infants to the elderly. I speak proficient French as well as some Spanish, and am happy to work with patients in those languages. Social justice and equitable access to healthcare are very important to me. I have been working to unlearn racism and better understand the problematic history of our medical system's mistreatment of the global majority. I attend cultural competency courses and trauma-informed care trainings. I am honored to work with LGBTQIA+ and BIPOC folks and I strive to provide a safe environment for all people. I am happy to offer referrals to other practitioners that may better fit people's preferences. My goal is to facilitate a decolonial approach to healthcare and healing (see below). I enjoy treating pain, mental health, gastrointestinal issues, dermatological conditions, and sexual and reproductive health concerns. I appreciate that nearly any complaint or condition can be addressed with Chinese Medicine. I also provide care for veterans as part of the community care program with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). I received my Doctorate of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine from Pacific College of Health and Science (formerly known as Pacific College of Oriental Medicine) in Chicago and San Diego. I am nationally board certified by the NCCAOM as a Diplomate of Oriental Medicine. I served as secretary for the Acupuncture Association of Louisiana, and was awarded the Trudy McAlister Foundation Scholarship during my graduate studies. I am a Licensed Acupuncturist in Louisiana and Colorado. Decolonial approach to healthcare: I am not here to \"fix\" you. While I have knowledge and training in Chinese Medicine, I do not consider myself more qualified than you in determining what is best for you and your body. I intend to work WITH you towards healing, and hope that you will participate and contribute to the process. I will ask for consent and explain what I am doing or plan to do. Some colonial/ [white supremacist concepts](https://www.whitesupremacyculture.info/) that I am working to let go of in my practice include: urgency, good/bad binary, one right way to do things/perfectionism, separation of body/mind/spirit. It is very important to me that you feel seen and heard, and that you not feel that you have to advocate for yourself because we are working together. I aim to provide a space where you feel safe and cared for. I do my best to remain humble, to know that I will make mistakes, and to be open to hearing from others about any of the ways that I might collude with white supremacy and colonialism. \"Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished\" -Lao Tzu \"Nature is the source of all true knowledge\" -Leonardo Da Vinci Pricing Initial consultation and treatment: $115 Follow-up treatment: $95 Herbal consultation: $75 Treatment price does not include the cost of herbs, which varies between roughly $8 and $25 for two-weeks worth, should you be interested in herbal medicine.
