Chamberlain Abstract Goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), a member of the buttercup (Ranunculaceae), is an herbaceous perennial found in rich hardwood forests throughout the Northeastern UnitedStates and Canada. Originally used by Native Americans as both a medicine and a dye, theherb was eventually adopted by the settlers and eclectic physicians 1 in the 19th century. The alkaloids in goldenseal have been found to have antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic,and tonic effects. Scientists and physicians continue to expand on the knowledge of theclinical applications and disease-fighting potential of the plant. Growing awareness ofpossible medicinal benefits has increased worldwide consumption, which, combined with acontinual loss of habitat, has greatly reduced wild populations. Goldenseal has been listedunder the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora(CITES) Appendix II protection since 1997. Demand for cultivated roots has increased aswild populations become scarce, motivating research into propagation and cultivationtechniques. More attention should be focused on: educating consumers about the appropriateuses of the herb in order to reduce overconsumption; working with growers to increase theprofitability of cultivation and reduce pressures on wild plants; and identifying and trackingwild populations to determine the most effective management and conservation practices. Keywords: Conservation, goldenseal, Hydrastis , medicinal herbs, nontimber Goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ) is an herbaceous perennial found in rich hardwood forests throughout the Northeastern United States and Canada(Small and Catling 1999). The herb' s range encompasses the Ohio RiverValley with Cincinnati serving as an important trade center (Grieve 1931)(fig. 1). Most wild-harvested goldenseal comes from the few surroundingStates: Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, West Virginia, and Virginia (Grieve 1931,Harding 1936). Although the range extends north into Ontario andMinnesota and south into Georgia and Missouri, overharvest and habitatloss have greatly reduced wild populations in most of these areas(NatureServe Explorer 2002, U.S. Department of Agriculture 2001). 1 Eclectic physicians were doctors who treated patients with herbal medicines between the late 1800s and early 1900s.2Mature goldenseal plants emerge in early spring with a pubescent, cylindrical stem that reaches 12 inches tall (Grieve 1931, Sievers 1930) (fig.2). The stem is a bright yellow color below ground and purplish above, withseveral small scales at the base (Cech 2002, Miller 1988). Each stem isforked, with two terminal five- to seven-lobed palmate leaves (Foster andDuke 2000). One leaf is usually larger than the other; leaves range from 3 to12 inches wide and 3 to 8 inches long (Harding 1936, Plyler 2001-02). Bothleaves are dark green, prominently veined, and have serrate margins (Grieve1931). Immature or weak plants form a stem with one leaf and no flower(Miller 1988, Sievers 1949). Figure 1\u2014Goldenseal range and distribution (adapted from NatureServe ExplorerDatabase 2002 and U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources ConservationService 2001).3Flowers appear in April and May when the leaves are only partially developed and typically last only 5 or 6 days (Foster and Duke 2000,Harding 1936). Individual blooms are only a half-inch in diameter, withthree small petal-like sepals that fall away as the bud expands (Grieve 1931,Small and Catling 1999). Flowers are hermaphroditic (including both maleand female organs) and greenish-white in color with white stamens inclusters (Fern 1997-2000, Foster and Duke 2000). The fruit, which resembles a large raspberry (hence the common name \"ground raspberry\"), turns red and ripens in July and August (Grieve 1931,Harding 1936, Sievers 1930). Each berry contains 10 to 20 small, hard,shiny black seeds, which are dispersed by birds and other animals (Bowers1891, Cech 2002, Eichenberger and Parker 1976, Harding 1936). The root system consists of horizontal rhizomes, 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick, with numerous fibrous rootlets (Davis 1999, Harding 1936). The name\"goldenseal\" comes from the bright yellow color of the roots and from thecircular scars from previous years' stems that resemble waxed seal imprints(Cech 2002, Grieve 1931, Harding 1936). Roots reach maturity after 4 to 5years, then begin to die back at one end as quickly as they grow at the other(Davis and McCoy 2000). Figure 2\u2014Goldenseal plant (Britton and Brown1913).4Bowers (1891) thoroughly describes the various stages of the goldenseal life cycle. Seeds sown naturally after the fruit ripens in August germinate thefollowing spring. In the first year of growth, two cotyledons and a smallradicle are produced. During the second year, plants send up a stem with asingle, palmate leaf. Plants reach maturity in their third or fourth year,sending up a forked stem with two leaves and a flower. Wild populations of goldenseal primarily reproduce asexually. Several growing points form on the rhizome, and knotlike buds develop on thefibrous roots, which eventually develop into independent plants (Cech2002). Natural populations tend to grow in dense clonal clumps, with lessreproductive effort put into seed production (Gagnon 1999). Roots are typically harvested in the fall. Lloyd and Lloyd (1884-1887) reported substantially more weight loss when drying roots that wereharvested while still succulent and growing as opposed to roots harvestedafter the fruit ripened. Harvesting roots before the fruit ripens also preventsthe maturation and dispersal of seeds and, therefore, is not recommended(Miller 1988). The fibrous rootlets become brittle and break off whiledrying; the bare, knotted rhizome is the part used in commercial trade(Harding 1936, Lloyd and Lloyd 1884-1887, Miller 1988). Goldenseal is found on a variety of sites: in open woods; on hillsides, ridges and bluffs; and along streams and rivers where there is good drainage, ashady tree canopy, and plenty of leaf mold (Fern 1997-2000, Miller 1988,Sievers 1930, Small and Catling 1999). Mueller (2001) describes twopopulations of goldenseal growing on very different geological substrates.One population was found on calcareous, dolomitic limestone soils with apH of 4.4 to 8.0, whereas the other was growing in a granitic terrain with apH range of 5.5 to 6.0. Penskar and others (2001) identified the plant species often associated with goldenseal in Michigan. Overstory species include Acer saccharum (sugar maple), grandifolia nigra (green and black ash). Common herbs that are associated with goldenseal include many others. Other associated herbs include valuablemedicinals such as American as a member of the Ranunculaceae family, though several studies have suggested that the genus Hydrastis belongs in its own family (Hoot 1991, Tobe and Keating 1985). Uses MedicinalThe genus name Hydrastis is derived from two Greek words meaning \"water\" and \"to accomplish,\" referring to the plant' s effects on the mucusmembranes (Nutriflip 1998). Native Americans had numerous uses for goldenseal and taught its various properties to European settlers (Bergner 1997, Foster 2000, Moerman1999). The Cherokee used it as a wash for inflammations and as a treatmentfor dyspepsia, cancer, poor appetite, and general debility (Foster 2000,Moerman 1999). The Iroquois used the root to treat whooping cough,diarrhea, tuberculosis, liver disease, fever, earaches, stomachache,flatulence, pneumonia, and heart trouble (Foster 2000, Moerman 1999). TheMicmac used goldenseal to treat chapped and cut lips (McCaleb 1994). The most common historical medicinal uses for goldenseal include an eye wash (hence the common names eye root and eye balm), a bitter tonic, adigestive aid and appetite stimulant, and a treatment for mucus membraneinflammation (Foster 2000, Lloyd and Lloyd 1884-1887, Miller 1988,Sievers 1930). Eclectic physicians experimented with various additionaluses for the root, including treatments for nasal catarrh, sore throat,tonsillitis, ear diseases, diphtheria, scarlatina, gonorrhea, vaginal and uterineleucorrhea, ulcers, skin disorders, passive blood debility, Lloyd 1884-1887, Petersen 1905, Potter 1902).6In modern medicine, goldenseal has been used as an antibiotic, immunostimulatory, anticonvulsant, tonic, and sedative; it has been usedparticularly to treat infections of the eyes, ears, nose, throat, stomach,intestines, uterus, and vagina (Bergner 1997, Bradshaw 1997, Fern 1997-2000, Foster and Duke 2000). Goldenseal has been shown to have antibioticproperties against numerous bacteria, fungi, and parasites in laboratory testsand can prevent the overgrowth of yeast that often results from antibioticuse. Goldenseal shows particular promise as a treatment for infectioustuberculosis (Gentry and others 1998). In the intestines, it inhibits theadhesion of bacteria to host tissue and, therefore, prevents infections.Physiologically it increases blood supply to the spleen, activatesmacrophages and white blood cells, and stimulates secretion of bile andbilirubin (Anon. 2000). Foster (1989) suggests that goldenseal can aid in theelimination of toxins from the kidney, liver, and blood. Until the 1980s,goldenseal was a constituent in many eye washes due to its antiseptic effectsand ability to constrict capillaries and reduce bloodshot eyes. Goldenseal isconsidered to be a synergistic or carrier herb (one that increases theeffectiveness of other herbs) and is often used in combinations, particularlywith Echinacea species. Current studies are looking at the ability of goldenseal to fight tumor cells (Bradshaw 1997; Foster and n.d.; McCaleb 1994; NatureServe Explorer 2002). Although goldenseal is reported to be an incredibly useful plant, the reputation of the herb as a heal-all is misleading and has contributed toexcessive collection. The belief that goldenseal can mask illicit drugs inurine tests, particularly morphine, is a myth started by John Uri Lloyd in his1900 novel \"Stringtown on the Pike\" (Foster 1989). Scientific research hasdisproved this belief (Combie and others 1982, Foster and Duke 2000,Mikkelsen and Ash 1988), but the myth persists. Bergner, in his article \"Goldenseal and the Common Cold: the Antibiotic Myth,\" covers the appropriate use and dosage of goldenseal to treat coldsand flu symptoms. According to Bergner, many people take goldensealthinking that it will treat any type of cold; however, goldenseal is onlyeffective in fighting bacterial infections, not viral infections. It is alsomisleading to think that goldenseal can prevent colds. Taking the herb tooearly or in excessive doses can cause more harm than good, as its activeingredients can dry out mucus membranes, inhibit the healthy inflammatoryreaction, and weaken the digestive system (Bergner 1996-97, Bergner1997).7Goldenseal can cause mild toxicity if ingested in large doses, resulting in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, nervousness, and depression (Russell 1997). Thealkaloids are excreted slowly and can accumulate in the body, causingadverse effects on the mucus membranes and digestive system (Bergner1997). It is therefore recommended that treatment be limited to 3 months.Goldenseal should not be used during pregnancy as it stimulates the uterusand can cause abortion or premature labor (Bradshaw 1997, Fern 1997-2000, McCaleb 1994). Clinical StudiesThe alkaloids, particularly berberine, canadine, and hydrastine Duke 2000). Berberinecontains the main antibacterial and anticonvulsive properties, increasing thesecretion of bile, and lowering blood pressure (Foster and Duke 2000). It isbelieved that the other alkaloids act together synergistically to reducemuscle spasms. If any one of the main alkaloids is removed, theeffectiveness is greatly reduced (Foster and Duke 2000). Other constituentsinclude berberastine, meconin, chlorogenic acid, phytosterins, resins,albumin, starch, lignin, and a small quantity of volatileoil that contributes to the odor of the root (Bradshaw 1997). Most of the scientific research on goldenseal has focused on identifying the medicinal alkaloids and understanding their mechanisms of action (Abdel-Haq and others 2000, Ckless and others 1995, Cometa and others 1996,Messana 1980, Palmery and others 1993, Periera da Silva and others 2000,Rehmann and others 1999, Scazzocchio and others 2001, Schmeller andothers 1997, Sun and others 1988). Many of these studies have focused onthe main alkaloid berberine, which is also 1997, Bhide and others 1969, Birdsall and Kelly 1997, Lau and others 2001). Other research has looked at the usefulness of goldenseal and/or berberine to treat specific diseases and disorders such as: recurrent otitis media inchildren (Babbar and 1982, Bradshaw intestinal tract infections caused by Escherichia coli tuberculosis (Gentry symptoms of streptozotocin diabetes (Swanston-Flatt andothers 1989). In addition, recent studies have identified the potential use of8goldenseal to fight tumor cells (Kuo and others 1995, Nishino and others 1986). These studies suggest that goldenseal can cause apoptosis(preprogrammed early death) of abnormal cells and suppress the tumor-promoting activity of cancer cells. Laboratory research has explored methods for identifying and quantifying the constituents of pharmaceutical goldenseal preparations (Abourashed andKhan 2001, Datta and others 1971, El-Masry and others 1980, Govindanand Govindan 2000, Li and Sturm and Stuppner anddeveloping micropropagation techniques (Bedir and others 2003, Hall andCamper 2002). A few studies have examined the safety and/or toxicity of goldenseal and its constituents. Inbaraj and others (2001) investigated the phototoxicity ofberberine and concluded that the alkaloid does have toxic potential,particularly when applied topically. The authors suggest avoiding exposureto ultraviolet light when using goldenseal externally; however, they alsoassert that the interaction between the alkaloid and ultraviolet light mayactually contribute to the drug' s efficacy. Tice (1997) provides a thoroughreview of the literature on the toxic potential of both berberine andhydrastine. Other UsesNative Americans commonly used goldenseal to stain their faces and dye clothing (Fern 1997-2000, Grieve 1931, McCaleb 1994, Moerman 1999).Several common names for the species denote this use of the roots, such asyellow root, orange root, yellow puccoon, Indian golden root, root, and yellow eye Sievers 1930). The Cherokee also mixed goldenseal rootwith bear grease to make an insect repellent (Fern 1997-2000, McCaleb1994, Miller 1988; Small and Catling 1999). Market Trends According to Sievers (1949), before 1880 the price for goldenseal averaged8 to 12 cents per pound. Decreasing supplies increased prices to 58 centsper pound in 1890. Prices fluctuated in the following decades, showing ageneral increase over time with several periods of low prices (Lloyd andLloyd 1884-1887, Harding 1936, Sievers 1949). Current prices for goldenseal roots range between $30 and $50 per pound (Davis 1999). Variations in price depend on the quality, cleanliness, and9alkaloid content of the roots. Wholesale prices of $100 per pound have been reported (Foster 2000). Decreasing supplies of wild roots have increasedprices, which dropped as low as $8 to $11 per pound in the early 1990s(Foster 2000). In 2002, retail prices from various goldenseal vendors ranged from $5.50 to $11 per ounce or $.80/g of cut whole roots, and $6.50 to $12 per ounce or$.90/g of powdered root (with the higher prices for certified organic roots orwild harvested roots); $11 per $12 $3 cut and leaf; and $.30/mLfluid leaf extract n.d.; Viable cultivation purposes, goldenseal is available $5 to $8 for in quartpot; $1.50 to $3 per live rootlet; and $11 per packet (number Farm Gardensof the Blue Ridge, n.d.; Richters Herbs, n.d.). Lloyd and Lloyd (1884-1887) estimate the total annual consumption of goldenseal roots in the late 1800s at 140,000 to 150,000 pounds. A total of15,000 pounds of roots was exported to Europe in 1883, though theEuropean market was considered at the time to be \"spasmodic.\" Fifty yearslater, Grieve (1931) estimated the market for goldenseal roots to be 200,000to 300,000 pounds, with one-tenth of that amount exported and the rest useddomestically. The current annual consumption is estimated at more than250,000 pounds of dried roots (Foster 2000). It takes approximately 200 to250 rhizomes to make 1 pound dry weight (NatureServe Explorer 2002). According to a market report by Bannerman (1997), the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) lists goldenseal as one of thebest selling herbs internationally. The herb is listed in the officialpharmacopoeias of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy and is a componentin homeopathic remedies produced in Australia, France, Germany, Spain,Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Most of the exported goldensealgoes to France, Germany, and Italy to make tinctures, extracts, dilutions,and other phyto-therapeutic products. Many of these finished products arethen exported back to the United States. The Tonnage Survey of North American Wild-Harvested Plants by the American Herbal Products Association (2003) shows a decrease ingoldenseal consumption over the last 4 years with an increase in the amountof cultivated root supplying the market.10Cultivation In the late 1800s, eclectic physicians began expressing concern about the sustainability of goldenseal, observing that overharvest and loss of habitatwere quickly reducing the abundance of wild goldenseal (Harding 1936,Lloyd and Lloyd 1884-1887). Harding (1936) wrote extensively aboutpropagating and cultivating goldenseal. His book \"Ginseng and OtherMedicinal Herbs\" included methods of goldenseal propagation, markets,conservation, and stories of growers' experiences. Numerous articles and books have been published detailing current research on goldenseal propagation and cultivation (Beyfuss 1998, Davis 1999,Davis and McCoy 2000, Haage and Ballard 1989, Konsler 1987, Sinclairand Catling 2001). Older articles on goldenseal cultivation (Harding 1936,Henkel and Klugh 1908, Lloyd 1912, Van Fleet 1914) are often referencedin current literature; many of the cultivation and propagation methods havenot changed significantly in the last century. Although information on cultivation is readily available, cultivation itself is not a fast or easy undertaking. Before the crop can be harvested, goldensealmust be grown for 3 to 5 years when propagated from rhizomes, or 5 to 7years when propagated from seed (Davis and McCoy 2000, Sievers 1949).Plants can be grown for an additional year if market conditions are notoptimal; however, the rhizomes begin to become overcrowded anddeteriorate after reaching maturity. Leaves are occasionally usedmedicinally, so there is a small market for fresh or dried leaves (Davis1999). Germination rates for purchased seeds range from 10 to 90 percent (Davis 1999). Better results can be obtained by growers who collect their own seedsand sow them immediately. Seeds must be planted as soon as possible or bylate autumn (Fern 1997-2000). Regardless, Davis (1999) states that\"propagation of goldenseal from seed can be difficult and unpredictable.\" A more reliable method of propagation involves dividing healthy rhizomes into 1/2-inch thick or larger pieces, each containing a bud and rootlets. Therhizomes are planted in the fall or early spring in the southern part of theplant' s range (Cech 2002, Davis 1999, Fern 1997-2000). The NationalCenter for the Preservation of Medicinal Herbs (1999) is conductingresearch on the various methods of propagating rhizomes and successivegrowth rates at various sites.11Once goldenseal plants are established, they can be transplanted to woods or cultivated beds. Wooded areas should be cleared of undergrowth that willcompete with roots for nutrients (Davis 1999). The optimum sites forgoldenseal are wooded areas that support several of the other plant speciesassociated with the herb (Cech 2002). Plants grown in cultivated beds mustbe mulched to retain moisture, reduce weeds, and protect roots during coldweather (Davis 1999, Sievers 1949). Cultivated goldenseal requires a shadestructure that provides 60 to 75 percent shade (Davis 1999, Grieve 1931,Sievers 1949). According to Davis (1999), goldenseal has relatively few pest problems when grown in natural wooded settings; however, several pest and diseaseproblems are known to occur in large cultivation operations. Some of theproblems most often encountered by goldenseal growers include slugs,which can eat the entire crown of the plant; root nematodes, whichreduce plant growth; moles and voles; and Botrytis leaf spot, which can be controlled by removing the affected foliage in mild infestations or byreplacing mulch during the over-wintering period in more severe cases.Other diseases known to infect cultivated goldenseal include Alternaria , Rhizoctonia , and Fusarium. Accurate yield estimates for goldenseal are not available due to variations in cultivation practices. An estimated average yield per acre is 1,000 to 2,000pounds dry root, though lows of 800 pounds and highs of 3,000 poundshave also been reported (Davis 1999). A national survey of goldenseal harvest conducted by the American Herbal Products Association reported a total of only 140 acres of goldenseal incultivation in 1998. At that time, they estimated an annual harvest of 35,000pounds of dried roots per year, projecting a future total of 82,000 pounds bythe fall of 2000 (McGuffin 1999). Conservation Issues Like many other valuable medicinal herbs in the Appalachian region, wildgoldenseal populations have substantially decreased and are more difficultto find than in the past. Many factors contribute to this decline:unsustainable collection of roots; loss of habitat due to the expansion ofurban areas, agricultural lands, and roads; and increased fragmentation ofremaining forested lands from timber harvest and recreational use.Goldenseal is particularly sensitive to soil disturbance and does not grow onland that has been cleared or plowed (Lloyd 1912).12It is estimated that there are 1,000 to 5,000 populations of goldenseal globally, each with approximately 70 to 500 individuals (NatureServeExplorer 2002); however, populations are not tracked or monitored, so theaccuracy of these estimates is unknown. Goldenseal is listed as\"endangered\" by the States of Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts,Minnesota, North Carolina, and Vermont; \"threatened\" in \"of specialconcern\" in Wisconsin. In addition, the plant is on the \"rare plants\" list inAlabama; the \"to watch\" list in Delaware, Virginia, and Indiana; and isreported but unprotected in Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi,Ohio, and West Virginia (Bannerman 1997, NatureServe Explorer 2002,U.S. Department of Agriculture 2001). Goldenseal is on the United Plant Savers \"At-Risk List,\" which includes native plant species widely used in commerce that have significantlydeclined throughout their range (United Plant Savers, n.d.). The globalheritage status rank for goldenseal is G4, or \"apparently heritage the UnitedStates, and N2, or \"imperiled\" in Canada (NatureServe Explorer 2002). Since 1997, goldenseal has been listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora(CITES), which monitors international trade in live plants, whole and slicedroots, and parts of roots\u2014excluding manufactured parts or derivatives (i.e.,powders, pills, extracts, tonics, teas, confectionery, etc.) (Robbins 2000;U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Management Authority 1998; U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior 1999; U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, International Affairs, Office of Management Authority1999). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) is responsible forimplementing CITES within the United States. The export of goldensealrequires an individual dealer to apply for an export permit. All dealers mustkeep documentation of their goldenseal transactions, with completeverifiable information from the point of harvest to sale (i.e., harvest permits,landowner permission, area and date of harvest, amount of harvest,individual contact information, etc.). Before a dealer can actually exportgoldenseal roots, these documents must be reviewed by the USFWS toensure that the roots were legally collected and that the wild harvest ofgoldenseal was not detrimental to the species (Robbins 2000; U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, Office of Management Authority 1998; U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, Department of the Interior 1999; U.S. Fish and WildlifeService, International Affairs, Office of Management Authority 1999).13Discussion Sustainability of goldenseal has been a concern since the times of the first eclectic physicians who reported dwindling occurrences of wild populationsas early as the 1800s. In the last few decades, conservation strategies havebeen implemented, such as listing goldenseal in Appendix II of CITES,which regulates export and ensures that harvest of roots stays withinsustainable limits. However, goldenseal is not monitored or tracked in theStates where it occurs, and there is insufficient information available on theabundance and distribution of the species. Furthermore, there is littleinformation on the rate of regeneration and sustainable harvest amounts. Future efforts should focus on collecting data, particularly the number of occurrences of wild populations and the rate of regeneration after rootharvest, so that accurate sustainability levels can be determined. Cultivationcan reduce pressure on wild populations; therefore, research into optimalproduction strategies is a key component in conservation. Finally, educatingconsumers about the inappropriate uses of goldenseal (i.e., cold preventionand drug masking) can reduce unnecessary overconsumption of goldensealproducts.

Provides details on the structure, properties, and actions of berberine. The plant alkaloid berberine is a constituent in the roots, rhizomes, and stems ofseveral plant species. Berberine has been used medicinally throughouthistory, showing significant antimicrobial properties against bacteria,viruses, fungi, protozoans, and other infectious organisms. In modernmedicine, berberine is most commonly used to treat infections such asbacterial diarrhea, intestinal parasites, and ocular trachoma. The variouspharmacological actions include inhibition of metabolism and enterotoxinproduction for certain pathogens, inhibition of smooth muscle contractionand fluid accumulation in intestines, inflammation reduction, andstimulation of bile and bilirubin production, among others. The specificphysiological actions against these organisms are discussed. Berberine is notconsidered toxic in moderate doses, though high dosages can result ingastrointestinal problems, low blood pressure, and heart damage.

Summarizes the ecological growingconditions for potential growers to reproduce for successful wild-simulatedcultivation. A brief history of goldenseal collection and markets is provided.It is noted that Native Americans used goldenseal more than Americanginseng in their remedies. Goldenseal grows in a rich, moist, shady forestenvironment with other herbs such Site preparation can range from simply raking back leaves and broadcasting seeds to removing small trees and other understory plants,tilling soil, and arranging raised beds. Some details are provided on plantingand fertilization. The worst problems encountered in cultivating goldensealinclude slugs, poachers, Alternaria , Phytophthora , and Botrytis. Plants are harvested 3 to 4 years after planting. Roots start to die off if they are left forlonger periods of time. Cleaned roots are dried on screens in the shade or inair driers. When drying, roots lose approximately 70 percent of their weight.Total yields per acre are estimated at 1,000 to 2,000 pounds. Pricesfluctuate, making it difficult to predict the costs and returns of cultivation.23Keywords: Associated herbs, cultivation, drying, habitat, Native American uses, pests and diseases, site preparation, yield estimates.

Goldenseal is only found inNorth America, growing in moist shady hardwood forests with other herbssuch as such timber harvesting, agriculture expansion, roadexpansion, and increased urbanization have contributed to the decreasingnumbers of wild populations. The Network of National Heritage Programshas assigned goldenseal a \"fragile\" ranking. Trade is regulated in 7 of the 26States where goldenseal is found; wild harvest is prohibited in NorthCarolina, Vermont, Connecticut, Georgia, Massachusetts, and Minnesota.Goldenseal is reported, but unprotected, in Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa,Kentucky, Mississippi, Ohio, and West Virginia. It is on the \"rare plant\" listin Alabama; the \"watch\" list in Delaware, Virginia, and Indiana;\"threatened\" in Maryland, Tennessee, and New Y ork; special concern\" in Wisconsin. The United NationsFood and Agriculture Organization lists goldenseal as one of the top sellingherbs worldwide. It is listed in the official pharmacopoeias of France,Britain, Germany, and Italy. A large proportion of the goldenseal exported toItaly and France is used to make tinctures, dilutions, extracts, and otherproducts. Export amounts imply an enormous harvest of roots; but, withoutknowledge about sustainable harvest levels, the impact on the species isunknown. Because of concern over the conservation of resources,goldenseal was included in the Convention on International Trade inEndangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II in 1997.Research into cultivation methods and practices has increased in an effort toreduce the demand on wild plants.

Goldenseal is found in rich soils in shady forests throughoutthe Eastern United States and is primarily collected in the Ohio Valley andsold from Cincinnati. Goldenseal is a perennial herb with a horizontal,knotted, bright yellow 1/4- to 3/4-inch-thick rhizome. The rhizome iscovered with numerous rootlets and marks left by stems from previousyears. Stems are 6 to 12 inches tall, rounded with small hairs, and havescales at the base. Each stem has two dark green, wrinkled, and veinedleaves, palmately arranged with five to seven lobes, and irregularly toothedmargins. Flowers have only three small greenish-white sepals that fall awaysoon after opening, leaving no petals and numerous stamens. Characteristicsof dried roots are provided. The medicinal properties of the root arediscussed along with the chemical constituents. Native Americans used theroots as a tonic, a treatment for sore eyes and ulcers, and as a yellow dye.Goldenseal is most commonly used to treat digestive disorders, catarrh,appetite loss, nausea, hemorrhoids, and constipation.

In the 1930s, most of thecommercial supply was collected in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and WestVirginia. Goldenseal is a perennial, growing to a foot in height, andconsisting of a single stem with two leaves. Leaves are wrinkled and onlypartially developed at the time of flowering, but continue to expand as theplant matures. Flowers open in April and May, but only last 5 or 6 days. Thefruit appears in July or August, is shaped like a raspberry, and contains 10 to20 hard black seeds. The rhizomes are bright yellow and contain raised cup-like scars left by the previous years' stems. The scars resemble waxed seals,hence the common name goldenseal. Dried roots are crooked, wrinkled, andknotty, 1/8 to 1/3 inch in diameter, dull brown externally, and bright yellowinternally. Rootlets break off easily, leaving the rhizome almost bare. Rootsare collected in autumn after the seeds mature. Scarcity of native plantsfrom overcollection and habitat loss has increased the need for cultivatedresources. Cultivation is done in areas that are similar to the native habitatwith moist, rich soil and shade.

Goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ): an annotated bibliography. Gen. Tech. Rep. SRS-88. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department ofAgriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station. 67 p. Goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), a member of the buttercup is an herbaceous perennial found in rich hardwood foreststhroughout the Northeastern United States and Canada. Originally used by Native Americans as both a medicine and a dye, the herb was eventually adopted by the settlers and eclectic physicians in the 19 th century. The alkaloids in goldenseal have been found to have antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, antispas- modic, and tonic effects. Scientists and physicians continue to expand on the knowledge of the clinical applications and disease-fighting potential of theplant. Growing awareness of possible medicinal benefits has increased worldwide consumption, which, combined with a continual loss of habitat, has greatly reduced wild populations. Goldenseal has been listed under Conventionon International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) Appendix II protection since 1997. Demand for cultivated roots has increased as wild populations become scarce, motivating research intopropagation and cultivation techniques. More attention should be focused on: educating consumers about the appropriate uses of the herb in order to reduce overconsumption; working with growers to increase the profitability ofcultivation and reduce pressures on wild plants; and identifying and tracking wild populations to determine the most effective management and conservation practices.
