In the state of Tennessee, acute care hospitals have been required to report data on healthcare worker influenza vaccination to NHSN since January 2013. Long-term acute care (LTAC) hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) and ambulatory surgery centers have been required to report healthcare worker influenza vaccination data beginning with the 2014/2015 influenza season. Outpatient hemodialysis facilities and inpatient psychiatric facilities are required to report healthcare worker influenza vaccination data beginning with the 2015/2016 influenza season. Despite 2018 CMS changes, LTAC hospitals, and IRFs are still required to report health care worker influenza data in Tennessee. Please see the Quick Reference guide below for details. Facilities must report vaccinations received between July 1 and March 31 of each year by healthcare personnel at the facility, vaccinations received outside the facility, medical contraindications, and declinations. Data must be reported for all employees on payroll; licensed independent practitioners (physicians, advanced practice nurses, and physician assistants affiliated with the hospital but not on payroll); and students, trainees, and volunteers aged 18 or older.
