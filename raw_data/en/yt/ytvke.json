I give myself spiritual protection daily, when I work with a client and when I do spirit work. This blog will cover the various essential oils I recommend you can use to promote your own spiritual wellbeing and give spiritual protection.

I would recommend either diffusing, which is not only very safe but speaks to the Eastern, spiritual elemental Air. Given that we're in the age of Aquarius, this is very on point and will provide total spiritual protection for your Aura. However, for a small amount of people, diffusing may cause irritation, therefore stick to dry inhalations or anointing your chakras. Essential Oil Chakra Protection Another simple way to use essential oils would be to physically anoint your Chakras with them. Chakras are our energetic gateways, keeping them protected during any spiritual work is a must. For without spiritual protection, all sorts of negative, damaging energies can attach themselves to you. Essential oils offer really easy, powerful spiritual protection.

So, if you are carrying or suspect you are carrying a negative spiritual bogey, this is the essential oil for returning your spiritual protection. Similarly, in terms of good practice, use Cedarwood essential oil to cleanse your spiritual working space to eliminate any residual energies that maybe lurking from previous spiritual work. Or, if it's a new space, always clear it because you can't be sure what maybe there. I recommend using Cedarwood essential oil at the beginning of your spiritual work to cleanse your aura, chakras and environment. This essential oil is ideal for the Root chakra.
