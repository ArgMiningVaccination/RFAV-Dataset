Crystals have opened the door for healing and becoming more spiritual for many people. There are crystals for every occasion, emotion, problem, and goal that you might have. You can get crystals that help with everything from friendship to creativity to get a better night's sleep to healing old wounds. Whatever you're looking for in your life there is a crystal out there to help you with it. Remember to trust your gut when looking for a crystal, it's all about learning to trust yourself and letting your intuition guide you. If we learn to tap into that well of wisdom, we know exactly what we need for our own self-care and we know where in our wellness journey we are rising and where we may be falling. Taking this knowledge and finding crystals that can help strengthen our strengths and build resilience in places we may have fragility is a glorious act of self-care just in itself. As a beginner, it also helps to have a little background information - below, you will find 10 crystals that should be the basis for your collection; however, I would also like to give a disclaimer. When shopping for your stones always check their sourcing because some crystals can be collected unethically or they can just be completely fake. Shop local and from small reliable businesses. Also, be sure to cleanse your crystals once bought, as energy is transferable, and you want to choose the energy that you want, don't allow the previous owner's intentions to linger. While there is no right or wrong crystal to choose as a beginner, as you should always pick one that feels right for you, sometimes, your eye will automatically wander towards a certain shape or colour of crystal, other times your curiosity is sparked by the name or something within connects when you hear about the healing properties - a tiny whisper inside that says yes. We understand that with so many crystals out there it can be overwhelming to choose one which is where this beginners guide to the most popular crystals comes in handy. Here is a list of must-have crystals to get you started! 1) Clear Quartz This clear crystal is considered a 'master healer.' It's said to amplify energy by absorbing, storing, releasing, and regulating it. It's also said to aid concentration and memory. Physically, clear crystals are claimed to help stimulate the immune system and balance out your entire body. This stone is often paired with others like rose quartz to aid and enhance their abilities. 2) Rose quartz Just as the colour may suggest, this pink stone is all about love. It's said to help restore trust and harmony in all different kinds of relationships while improving their close connections. It's also claimed to help provide comfort and calm during times of grief. It isn't all about other people, though. Rose quartz is said to also encourage love, respect, trust, and worth within one's self \u2014 something we could all use in this day and age. 3) Amethyst This violet and purple quartz nurtures deep contemplation, a calm frame of mind, and an everlasting sense of serenity. It also aids in decision making too. On the physical level, those who struggle with sleep will find Amethyst helps to gently shut down your mind so you can rest easy. It also boosts immunity and takes care of migraines too. For those who crave calmness and positivity, Amethyst is your perfect starter stone. 4) Obsidian An intensely protective stone, black obsidian is said to help form a shield against physical and emotional negativity. It's also said to help get rid of emotional blockage and promote qualities of strength, clarity, and compassion to help find your true sense of self. For your physical body, it may aid in digestion and detoxification while potentially helping reduce pain and cramps. 5) Citrine Bring joy, wonder, and enthusiasm to every part of your life with citrine. It's said to help you release negative traits from your life like fear, and in turn help encourage optimism, warmth, motivation, and clarity. It's also claimed to provide motivation as well as enhancing mindful qualities, like creativity and concentration, and encourages self-expression. 6) Moonstone Moonstone is white and pearlescent in colour that also shines like, well, the moon. This crystal inspires emotional balance and inner peace that encourages you to go with the flow when life seems to become overwhelming. Known for 'new beginnings,' moonstone is said to encourage inner growth and strength. Moonstone is, of course, connected with the moon cycles that help you smooth out the emotional highs and lows of your life. With that said, it aids in emotional healing, menstrual health, and general wellness in women. Interestingly enough, it can help men relate to their feminine side as well. 7) Hematite Crystal users looking for a sense of balance often reach for silvery-black hematite. This healing stone is said to balance the energy between the body and the mind, providing a sense of equilibrium that helps people move through down days and past their anxious moods. This iron-rich stone was something of an obsession back in ancient Greece. They believed that it had incredible healing powers and could protect everyone from warriors on the battlefield to women in the birthing bed. These days, we recognise that Hematite is a strength bringer. It roots us right down, taps into our survival instinct, and helps us to overcome all that we fear and to call on our courage. 8) Pyrite Taking its name from the Greek word for fire, Pyrite is also known by the nickname of Fools Gold. Similar to gold in looks, Pyrite is all energy and is awesome at keeping negative vibes and electromagnetic field (EMF) effects at bay. Pyrite is a great stone for building up strength and stamina not just in the physical sense but emotionally too. It helps people to move out of stagnant and depressive energies and invites confidence levels to soar. 9) Blue Calcite Delicate-looking blue calcite is one of the most relaxing stones out there, and is a great crystal to use to relax during times of deep healing and to bring emotional peace. This crystal inspires calm and peace for your mind and your space in times of stress. It also helps with peaceful communication with others. The stone is said to reduce negative feelings by encouraging energy flow: Bad energy is eased out, and soothing energy is drawn in. 10) Black Tourmaline Another warrior stone to turn to when you need protection from electromagnetic field, Black Tourmaline is hugely powerful and having it in your collection is like wearing a cloak of protection. Black tourmaline is known for removing bad feelings left by negative people or events and creating a refreshed atmosphere that's more upbeat and positive. This stone can get you grounded in seconds and when our root is tethered to the floor we no longer need to worry about external forces shaking our foundations. This fact alone can be a huge boost in power and keep us stable in body, mind, and spirit. Pro tip: Always cleanse, then charge your crystals before each use! They can be cleansed by other crystals with cleansing properties, salt, or smoke from incense, sage or palo santo. They can be charged by the sun, moon, your energy, or even the energy from your pets. Conclusion: Crystals can have the power to change your life. They encourage us to be gentle with ourselves, to practice self-care, and to carry intention with us wherever we go. They provide a gateway into building ourselves up and working to align our body, soul, and spirit. "}
