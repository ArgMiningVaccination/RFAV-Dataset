An episode of care consists of all clinically related services for one patient for a discrete diagnostic condition from the onset of symptoms until the treatment is complete. Thus, for every new problem or set of problems that a person visits his clinical care provider, it is considered a new episode. Within that episode the patient will have many encounters with his clinical care providers till the treatment for that episode is complete. Even before the resolution of an episode, the person may have a new episode that is considered as a distinctly separate event altogether. Thus, there may be none, one or several ongoing active episodes. All resolved episodes are considered inactive. Hence they become part of the patient's past history. A notable point here is that all chronic diseases are considered active and may never get resolved during the life-time of the person, e.g., diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc.Varchar 50 PGWD Episode Type 05.009.0002This data element describes the type of the episode.

It is essential to retain permanent records of all patient encounters. Unique ID to be assigned for each patient encounter. A clinical encounter is defined as (1) an instance of direct provider/ practitioner to patient interaction, regardless of the setting, between a patient and a practitioner vested with primary responsibility for diagnosing, evaluating or treating the patient's condition, or both, or providing social worker services. (2) A contact between a patient and a practitioner who has primary responsibility for assessing and treating the patient at a given contact, exercising independent judgment. Encounter serves as a focal point linking clinical, administrative and financial information. Encounters occur in many different settings - ambulatory care, inpatient care, emergency care, home health care, field and virtual (telemedicine). It must be ensured that no encounter number is arbitrarily assigned. The system will need to ensure this. When linking records from diverse systems, episode and encounter reconciliation through appropriate merging and demerging will need to take place. Varchar 18 PGWD 10.

A system of categorization, with similarities to Pareto analysis, the method usually categorizes inventory into three bands with each band having a different management control associated. Although different criteria may be applied to each category the typical method of \"scoring\" an inventory item is that of annual stock value of said item (quantity in stock X cost of item) with the result then ranked and then scored (X, Y or Z). Bandings may be specific to the industry but typically follow a 70%, 90%, 100% banding in that X class items represent 70% of the stock value (although they may account for 20% number wise), Y class items fall between 70% and 90% of the annual stock value with C class the remaining. In practical terms the complex high cost materials typically fall into the X class items, with the consumable, low cost (and typically fast moving) classed as X class.
