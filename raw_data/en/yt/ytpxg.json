It is caused by various bacteria and viruses, long-term stress, but also irritating gases, dust, etc. Bronchitis is also often associated with colds such as inflammation of the upper respiratory tract (nose, throat, trachea) and various lung diseases. The most common signs of bronchitis are cough and a large amount of sputum. Signs of Bronchitis - The most characteristic feature of bronchitis is a relentless cough. - Because bronchitis makes it harder for air to move to the lungs, the lung tissue is often irritated and more mucus can come out. - Bronchitis can start with a dry, annoying cough, which often develops into coughing attacks, accompanied by a clear, white, yellowish or even green sputum. - Other symptoms of bronchitis may include a sore throat, tiredness, shortness of breath, chest discomfort or tightness, and a wheezing sound when breathing. - Patients with acute bronchitis may also have fever, chills, headache and muscle pain. - Young children may also vomit when they cough. Chronic Bronchitis Chronic bronchitis may occur when you suffer often from acute bronchitis. The normal cleansing capacity of the bronchial mucosa decreases, mucus production increases, mucus becomes thicker and its excretion deteriorates. This causes an infection and development of inflammation. Signs of chronic bronchitis are the constant excretion of large amounts of sputum, accompanied by large and often unbearable coughing. Occasionally, coughing attacks can become so severe that it can cause bleeding ulcers in the respiratory tract. In people with an impaired immune system who also suffer from chronic bronchitis, bronchitis can turn into pneumonia. Chronic bronchitis common causes: - smoking, - air pollutants - persistent inhalation of harmful substances (dust, car exhaust fumes, smoke), - climatic conditions (cold and humid air), - frequent respiratory infections or infectious inflammation, - long-term stress, depression and anxiety, - deficiency of certain cells in the body's defense system. Tobacco smoke is a constant irritant to the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. Therefore, smokers develop chronic bronchitis easily. The causes of exacerbation of chronic bronchitis are the same as for acute bronchitis - pneumococcus, hemophilia, etc. Complications of chronic bronchitis may include: - pneumonia, - excessive bronchodilation, - abscess in the lung, - chronic pulmonary and heart failure. How Long Does Bronchitis Last? - Acute bronchitis lasts from a few days to a couple of weeks. Home remedies such as hot drinks, herbal teas, and herbal expectorants are all suitable to support your treatment. If the bronchitis is caused by contamination, your body may also need cleansing preparations. In the acute phase of bronchitis it is recommended to stay at home. If the symptoms of bronchitis do not want to go away or are very severe, see your doctor or other medical professional, as you may need antibiotic treatment. - Chronic bronchitis is a more serious health condition. This disease is considered chronic if a person has a sputum-producing cough for at least three months in two consecutive years. Bronchitis Also Occurs Due To Long-Term Stress, Depression and Anxiety Bronchitis often also begins with long-term stress, depression and anxiety. For example when a person works too much or is overwhelmed with feelings such as guilt, regret or resentment. All this stress and feelings often manifest as unnoticed breathing and strong tension in the upper body in the lung area. Bronchial problems are often related to the ability to share one's true feelings. If you have to get something out what has been bothering you for a long time - your body forces you to cough that out. This area of the body is also related to how we receive an independent life through breathing. All the doubts, uncertainties, and fears you may feel about isolation or loneliness can manifest here. What do you need to let go or release? - Like for example that you are not good enough? - Do you feel like someone is suffocating you? - Is there anything disturbing or painful you want to get rid of? - Maybe you have said or done something you would want to take back? - Or do you feel that circumstances have taken over you? - Do you feel that it is difficult for you to maintain your personality? - You do something for others or to the liking of others? - Do you have conflicts with your independence and setting boundaries? - Did you recently end a relationship that made you emotionally addicted? - Do you feel that what you take in your heart emotionally burdens you? Emotions and thought patterns that may cause bronchitis Strength You may feel that all your negative experiences have made you stronger, and that this strength is based on how much you have experienced heroically in life. This illusion of strength and endurance testing comes at a price - exhaustion. This thought pattern can be changed by knowing that everything can be created with ease. Forgiveness You may also face the issue of forgiveness. Forgiving someone means giving up your strength, which is a sign of weakness for you. But by not forgiving, you are hurting yourself in the first place. There is no need to justify and approve of another act here, but forgiveness is important to release the resentment and anger within you. Feeling undervalued It might also be that you have been overwhelmed by a recent challenge in life. For example, you have given your project or goal your best, but you have been rejected or given only neutral feedback. As a result, you may feel emotionally undervalued and unhappy. Here it can help to acknowledge that you know how valuable you are, whether you are recognized or not. Talking about it will also help your employer, partner, or with whoever you are having this issue. While this may not change the attitude of your employer or partner, this kind of self-expression may help you. Feeling guilty You may also feel that you are not doing something right and you are being ridiculed for not following the expectations and demands of influential people, or you just feel that you are being expected to do more than you can give. This constant guilt and tension drains you out of energy and results in exhaustion and illness. This pattern changes as you learn to stand up for yourself, love yourself, and value yourself as you are. Being yourself and accepting your unique nature and sharing it with the world is so important first and foremost for yourself and all those who share it. Everyone has something that is their natural gift and strength, and it is definitely worth finding and sharing for. Suppressing feelings Also, you may not allow yourself to explore emotions, instead you will suppress your sadness if you could simply accept that feeling. For example, yes, I am very sad and unhappy and it is okay to feel that. You may also fear that if you let your emotions come to the surface, you will lose your temper and flood people over with your volcanic rage. Expressing yourself and expressing your needs equates to fear of being punished and criticized. You got this pattern as a child, but it's over and you don't have to be afraid anymore. Holding on feelings Or you have been in the grip of earning love or unresolved grief for too long. Bronchitis often starts after a long conflict between you and someone who has caused you great grief, stress, anger or rage. Releasing all these negative and difficult feelings will help you heal faster. Bronchitis needs a decision that this situation can no longer continue, ant it must change now. 29 Home Remedies To Support Bronchitis Treatment - Vitamins, Minerals, Foods, Herbs and Other Essential Nutrients Vitamins - Vitamin A - protects lung tissue. - B vitamins - [improve nervous system](https://ecosh.com/b-vitamins-necessary-for-the-function-of-the-nervous-system-brain-and-cardiovascular-system/)and overall health. - Vitamin C - neutralizes [free radicals](https://ecosh.com/free-radical-damage-22-diseases-caused-by-free-radicals/)that can [damage](https://ecosh.com/free-radical-damage-22-diseases-caused-by-free-radicals/)your cells, DNA and the [immune system](https://ecosh.com/13-helpful-ways-and-16-top-healthy-foods-to-boost-your-immune-system-and-fight-off-disease/). - Vitamin E - increases the oxygen supply to the lungs.
