The Chemicals To Avoid In Fitness Yoga Balls Phthalates: Phthalates are primarily used to soften plastics. They have been linked to reproductive organ damage, cancer, obesity, and allergies. Unfortunately, some manufacturers add phthalates to their fitness yoga balls without disclosing the information on the label. When purchasing a yoga ball, look for labels that explicitly state \"phthalate-free.\" BPA: BPA (bisphenol A) is a chemical found in many types of plastic containers and bottles. It has been linked to various health issues such as infertility, heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. It is especially dangerous for pregnant women or children as its effects can be especially devastating during these sensitive periods. To ensure your safety when using fitness yoga balls, look for ones labeled \"BPA-Free\" or \"Non-toxic\" on their packaging or online product descriptions. The 5 Best Non-Toxic Yoga Balls 1. Bean Products Gym Exercise Ball - 30 inch diameter - Dual-action pump - Available in 3 size Customer's story: I had heard about Bean Products through a friend of mine and was excited to try out their yoga exercise ball. When the package arrived, I could hardly contain my excitement as I pumped it up with air. It only took me a few minutes before it was ready for use! The 45cm ball felt very firm in my hands and I knew that this would be perfect for doing yoga poses. Despite its small size, this ball seemed like it had plenty of space on which to rest or do exercises without feeling cramped or squished. One thing that did catch me off guard, however, was how slightly egg-shaped the ball appeared to be when inflated - something I wasn't expecting from such a high quality product! But aside from that minor drawback, I have been thoroughly pleased with the performance of my Bean Products yoga exercise ball so far and can definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable way to get started with their own home practice. 2. GalSports Exercise Ball Yoga Ball for Home Gym - 65 Centimeters - SGS Certified Latex-free PVC Customer's story: When I first bought the yoga ball, I was skeptical. How could something so small and seemingly insignificant help me with my sciatic nerve pain and back issue? But to my surprise, it worked better than anything else I had tried before. The yoga ball was very easy to inflate, which made it a great choice for my office chair. Not only did it support my back, but also allowed me to move around more freely throughout the day. And when sitting became too uncomfortable or boring, I would switch over to standing up instead - something that quickly became part of my daily routine! But what really set the yoga ball apart from other chairs and treatments were its exercises. As instructed by my physical therapist, each time I used the yoga ball for work, I would take a few minutes out of each hour to perform specific stretches and exercises designed specifically for relieving sciatic nerve pain and strengthening muscles in order to support good posture. At first these exercises felt strange and awkward as they required stretching areas of my body that had been neglected due to years of bad habits; however after just a few months of using them regularly, those same movements began feeling natural - like an extension of myself rather than an obligatory task that needed completing every day. I'm now grateful for having such an accessible tool at home as well as in the office that makes working while dealing with back issues far easier than expected! 3. Trideer Yoga Ball Exercise Ball 5 Sizes Ball Chair - Latex-Free PVC - Non-slip Surface Customer's story: I had heard of yoga balls, but I never thought they would be useful to me. Then my doctor suggested one after I had injured my knee in a soccer accident. He said it was important for rehabilitation and that the ball could help me strengthen my core muscles so as not to put too much strain on the injured knee. At first, I was skeptical, but then after trying it out I realized how great these things are! Not only did it help me with physical therapy exercises, but I also found myself using it while sitting at home watching TV or doing other activities requiring long periods of sitting. It's like getting a workout done without having to leave your seat\u2014it's amazing! For those new to this type of exercise ball, you may need someone nearby who can spot you if you start losing balance. But aside from that minor detail, there is nothing else bad about these balls - they are incredibly helpful and effective tools when used properly. And even better - they're affordable too! I definitely recommend buying one if you suffer from back problems or just want an easier way to stay active during your leisure time - because trust me when I say this thing is worth every penny! 4.

When I saw this Yoga Ball from Professional Physical Therapists, I knew it was the perfect addition to my routine. The ball is great for improving stability and coordination, maximizing strength and endurance, and strengthening the core muscles - all of which are must-haves in any good yoga practice. The ball has proven itself time and again during my sessions: its construction is strong enough to support me no matter how intense the pose may be, while also being soft enough that it doesn't cause me discomfort or strain on any part of my body. It's definitely one of those pieces of equipment that you can tell were designed with both safety and effectiveness in mind; not too hard but not too soft either! I've even started using it outside of just yoga classes - sometimes we use it in Pilates classes as well as physiotherapy exercises at home. Its versatility gives me so much more flexibility when creating workouts tailored to whatever goals I want to achieve that day (or week!). All in all, this Yoga Ball from Professional Physical Therapists has become a valuable asset in helping me move better every day! 5.

Customer's story: I recently purchased a yoga ball to help me with my abdominal strength and flexibility, as well as for active sitting. As I am expecting a baby soon, I was also planning on using it as a birthing ball in order to make the birth process easier and safer. I chose this particular yoga ball because it is free of harmful phthalates or other toxins which can be dangerous during pregnancy. After receiving the package, I opened it up eagerly and blew up the yoga ball with an air pump (which came included). The instructions were very easy to follow! After inflating the yoga ball, I tested its surface by pressing down on it gently. It felt strong enough for me to sit on without any worries about popping or deflating - just what I wanted! So far my experience with the product has been great. My abdomen feels stronger and more flexible after using it daily, and my back no longer aches from sitting too long in one position at work thanks to its supportiveness when used for active sitting. Finally, I'm confident that this will help me have an easier labor due to its lightweight design yet sturdy texture - exactly what you want when giving birth!
