FY 2010 Annual Report 3From the Dean As i look over the accomplishments of the college each year, i am always astounded and proud of the amazing work that is carried out by our students, faculty, staff and volunteers. This tradition has been at the heart of the institution since its inception 125 years ago. Faculty continued this tradition of excellence. w e were all thrilled when not one, but two compounds of Ching-Shih Chen began clinical trials. Milap Nahata received the Richard A. Helms Award of e xcellence in Pediatric Pharmacy Practice, and Marialice Bennett was elected president of the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) , an event we will be celebrating this spring. Our students were extremely active as well. Students received numerous awards, fellowships and scholarships, including Ana Azevedo, who received the Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) for i ndividual Predoctoral Fellowships (F31) to promote Diversity in Health-Related Research from the National Cancer i nstitute (NCi). Our PharmD students provided over 12,850 hours of service related to community health. it is a testament to the dedication of our students to the field of pharmacy and to the health of our community. As we look back upon the year, and the previous 124, the strong academic programs in professional, graduate, and undergraduate education are a reflection of the high quality faculty, students, researchers, and staff of the College. i encourage you to contact our faculty to learn more about the important research and scholarship being conducted here at The Ohio State University.

Our graduate program and research interests are strongly tied to interdisciplinary approaches to the solution of chemical and biochemical problems. Our faculty are also active participants in The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center and are responsible for the operation and research of the Radiochemistry and i nstrumentation Laboratory of the Cancer Center. Some of our faculty also participate in the Ohio State Biochemistry Program on campus. The research within the Division involves interaction with all other units of the College of Pharmacy as well as studies involving the Colleges of Biological Sciences, Medicine, v eterinary Medicine, and Dentistry. PharmaceuticsDivision members teach drug delivery systems, pharmacokinetics and biopharmaceutics to BSPS, PharmD and graduate students. PhD graduates of the division enter careers in the pharmaceutical industry and academia, and perhaps surprisingly, in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration where nine former students work on new drug approval. The FDA employs more of the division's PhD graduates than any other single employer. Pharmacology The Division of Pharmacology is dedicated to research, with a focus on cardiovascular pharmacology and neuropharmacology. Students in the Division of Pharmacology become involved in discovering the mechanism of action of drugs, using drugs as tools or probes to learn how body systems work, and studying disease models to find new targets on which drugs can act. Pharmacy Practice & Administration The Pharmacy Practice area of the Division plays a key role in the college's professional programs including the entry-Level Doctor of Pharmacy Program (eLPD) and the Non-Traditional Doctor of Pharmacy Program (NTPD). Pharmacy Practice courses are also offered in an undergraduate BSPS program. The Programs in Pharmaceutical Administration at The Ohio State University emphasize the understanding, analysis and solutions of the major administrative problems and challenges facing pharmacy practice and the pharmaceutical industry, primarily through excellence in teaching, research and public service in the academic setting and through facilitating sound decision-making in non-academic settings. The active interaction of faculty members and students within the programs allows students to develop and maintain high standards of professionalism, and provide the capacity of adapting to the changing pharmaceutical and health care environment.Overview6 The Ohio State University College of PharmacyAdministration Robert W .

Na-onal Science Founda-on (NSF) Pharma 18 The Ohio State University College of PharmacyResearch Two Ohio State Cancer Drugs i n Clinical Trials Testing For the second time within a year, an experimental drug invented by cancer researchers at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research i nstitute (OSUCCC- James) is being tested on patients in a clinical trial. Adult patients began receiving doses of the potentially groundbreaking drug, which is designed to treat relapsed or treatment- resistant multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma, said Dr. John Byrd, associate director of clinical translational research at OSUCCC-James and a leukemia specialist who initiated the drug's development with Ching-Shih Chen, an Ohio State cancer researcher and medicinal chemist. The new phase i/ii a clinical trial will assess the safety and initial evidence of activity of the oral drug AR-42, which belongs to a new class of drugs called histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors - compounds designed to reactivate genes that normally protect against cancer but are turned off by the cancer process. Ohio State is the only site worldwide accepting patients to the clinical trial, said Byrd. \"early tests in cancer cell models showed that AR-42 is 10,000 fold more potent than the starting/parent agent, \" said Chen, a professor of pharmacy, urology and internal medicine who holds the Lucius A. w ing chair of cancer research. i n 2003, Byrd asked Chen to try to improve the potency of a short-chain fatty acid known to have a weak inhibitory effect against cancer growth. Chen worked with cancer center and pharmacy colleagues at Ohio State to develop the drug originally called OSU-HDAC42, a broad spectrum histone and non-histone deacetylation inhibitor (pan-DAC). to the biopharmaceutical company Arno Therapeutics, i nc., for clinical development. \"it is exciting to see this very potent broad class i/ii HDAC inhibitor enter the clinic for treatment of blood cancers and we look forward to generating meaningful clinical results from in this Phase i/ii a study, \" said Byrd. \" we are incredibly grateful to organizations that have supported this effort to bring this drug forward to our blood cancer patients. Dr. Michael Caligiuri, director of Ohio State's Comprehensive Cancer Center and chief executive officer of the James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research i nstitute, praised the collaborative efforts of Ohio State researchers who worked more than 7 years to develop this drug. \"we are encouraged by its preclinical activity, and feel that this molecule could have meaningful clinical implications in a variety of cancers, \" said Caligiuri. Dr. Michael Grever, chairman of the department of internal medicine at Ohio State and co-leader of the e xperimental Therapeutics program at OSUCCC-James, was instrumental in moving this experimental agent from bench to bedside. The research was supported by funding from the National Cancer institute, U.S. Department of Defense Prostate Cancer Program, Ohio State's Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State's College of Pharmacy, Hearst Foundation, Prostate Cancer Foundation, Lucius A. w ing Chair, Stefanie Spielman Fund for Breast Cancer Research at OSUCCC-James, Susan G. Komen for the Cure, Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, MMORe, Harry T. Mangurian Foundation, i nc., and the D. w arren Brown Family Foundation. Ohio State researchers involved in developing the novel agent include Sam Kulp, David Lucas, Dasheng w ang, Aaron Sargeant, Qiang Lu, en-Shen Lu Po-Hsien Huang. OSUCCC-James hematologist and oncologist Dr. Craig Hofmeister is the principal investigator on the clinical trial. Last August, Ohio State's Comprehensive Cancer Center began enrolling patients in a clinical trial for AR-12, another anticancer agent designed by Chen and his team that also is being developed by Arno Therapeutics. AR-12 inhibits solid-tumor growth by triggering cancer cells to self-destruct. Cancer researcher Ching-Shih Chen worked with cancer and pharmacy colleagues at Ohio State to develop the small-molecule agent, originally called OSU-03012.. The agent is being developed AR-12 by Arno Therapeutics, i a therapeutics. \"The by inhibiting PDK-1 and P i3k/Akt pathways, a fundamental signaling point in cancer cells, making AR-12 potentially effective in a wide range of cancer types, \" said Chen. \" we are very excited. As bench scientists, our goal is to see our research translated into the clinic. \" The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research i nstitute (cancer.osu.edu) is one of only 40 Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the United States designated by the National Cancer i nstitute. Ranked by U.S. News & w orld Report among the top 20 cancer hospitals in the nation, The James is the 180-bed adult patient-care component of the cancer program at The Ohio State University. The OSUCCC-James is one of only seven funded programs in the country approved by the NCi to conduct both Phase i and Phase ii clinical trials.Ching-Shih Chen, PhD FY 2010 Annual Report 19National Recognitions and Aw ards Marialice Bennett e lected President of the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) George Hinkle 2010 APhA-APPM w illiam H.

Kirschstein National Research Service Award (NRSA) for i ndividual Predoctoral Fellowships (F31) to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research from the National Cancer institute (NCi), a division of the National institutes of Health (NiH). \"This award made it possible for me to become full-time in the lab sooner, allowing me to focus on my research, \" said Azevedo, \"The preparation of the proposal was also of great benefit to me. The intensive process helped me grow as a scientist and gave me insight into the current funding mechanisms. it is an honor to have NiH recognize my research and my achievements as a student with such a competitive award. \" Azevedo's research will focus on microRNAs, a relatively new class of gene regulators that have been shown to affect cancer progression and metastasis. Specifically, the project aims to determine the role of an important oncogenic microRNA, mir-21, in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most lethal types of cancer and is approximately 99% fatal. Reasons for the high death rate from this cancer include limited detection strategies, poor treatment options, and the fact that by the time it is diagnosed, the cancer has metastasized. Therefore, better understanding of the mechanism(s) responsible for pancreatic cancer metastasis could lead to improved treatment options. The study will examine the effects of modulating miR-21 expression in pancreatic cancer cells focusing on invasion and metastasis phenotypes. Successful completion of the study will provide new information about microRNAs' role in cell invasion/metastasis. Thomas Schmittgen, PhD, associate professor and Azevedo's major professor is pleased with her accomplishment. \"The F31 fellowships are extremely competitive and what makes Ana's case even more notable is that it was awarded on the very first submission, something that is rarely achieved with NiH grants. This says a lot about Ana's training thus far and her potential as an independent scientist. \" As part of the award, Azevedo will receive funding to cover tuition as well as a stipend to supplement the remainder of her graduate career. Azevedo, born in Goiana, Brazil, relocated to the United States as a teenager with her mother who was pursuing a PhD at Ohio State. Ana became involved in research early, working as a laboratory assistant during her junior year in high school. Prior to coming to Ohio State, Azevedo earned her bachelor's degree from the College of w ooster (OH), majoring in biochemistry and philosophy, where she was actively involved in many student groups. As a graduate student, she continues to participate in many organizations around campus including student government, University Senate, and the Graduate School's Graduate Council. i n the College of Pharmacy she is currently chair of the student chapter of the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists (AAPS), student representative in the Ohio State University Graduate Research Council, and was co-chair of the Pharmaceutics Graduate Student Research Meeting 2010. The Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards for i ndividual Predoctoral Fellowships to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research provide up to five years of support for research training leading to the PhD or equivalent research degree, the combined MD/PhD degree; or another formally combined professional degree and research doctoral degree in biomedical, behavioral, health services, or clinical sciences. These fellowships enhance the diversity of the biomedical, behavioral, health services, and clinical research labor force in the United States by providing opportunities for academic institutions to identify and recruit students from diverse population groups to seek graduate degrees in health-related research. The overall goal of this program is to increase the number of scientists from diverse population groups who are prepared to pursue careers in biomedical, behavioral, social, clinical, or health services research.

Students provided 12,850 hours of service related to community health24 The Ohio State University College of PharmacySchieber Presented with Champions Award Alumnus, Larry Schieber, RPh, was named the first recipient of the 2010 Cardinal Health Generation Rx Champions Award for excellence in community-based prescription drug abuse prevention. This award, which was presented at the Ohio Pharmacists' Association (OPA) 132nd Annual Conference held in Columbus (OH), is presented to honor a pharmacist who has demonstrated excellence in community-based prescription drug abuse prevention. The award is intended to recognize outstanding efforts within the pharmacy community to raise awareness of this serious public health problem. i t is also intended to encourage educational prevention efforts aimed at patients, youth, and other members of the community. Outreach & e ngagement Generation Rx The Generation Rx i niative continues to build momentum as a new online toolkit, developed by The Ohio State University College of Pharmacy with funding from the Cardinal Health Foundation, aims to help pharmacists work with concerned citizens, local schools and civic organizations to fight this growing social health problem in their communities. The new Generation Rx toolkit, available for free public download at go.osu.edu/generationrx, is a key component of a broader partnership between the two entities to increase public awareness of prescription medication abuse and to encourage health care providers, community leaders, parents, teens and college students to actively work to prevent it. Developed with input from pharmacists, the Generation Rx toolkit contains the communications materials needed to educate local schools and community organizations about the scope and consequences of prescription medication abuse and misuse. Partners for Promotion Partner for Promotion is a collaboration of The Ohio State College of Pharmacy faculty and students with community pharmacists to provide training and guidance for implementing expanded patient care services to both students and community pharmacy preceptors, as well as develop a collaborative environment in which students and preceptors who are interested in creating and implementing expanded patient care programs in community pharmacies are partnered together to develop these programs. The aquisition of grant funds from the Community Pharmacy Foundation allows the program to share the program model with five partnering colleges of pharmacy to assess the feasibility of adapting this model into various educational settings.
