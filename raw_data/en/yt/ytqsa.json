Cold Laser Therapy was recently approved by the FDA as a treatment for musculoskeletal conditions. Cold Laser Therapy uses the application of low-level, low-energy laser to the skin surface in order to stimulate cellular metabolism and enhance biochemical functioning in the underlying body tissue. How does Cold Laser Therapy work? The term laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. A simplified explanation of what a laser does is to amplify and direct light into a focused, coherent beam. When many people consider lasers they think of hot lasers. A hot laser outputs at least one million watts of energy which produces heat and causes damage to body tissue. Cold laser treatment utilizes the Erchonia, or True laser, which outputs less than one-hundredth of a watt and does not have a thermal effect on body tissue. The True laser \"bio-stimulates\" the cells as the light the laser produces is absorbed by photo acceptor sites on the cell membrane. The light then re-energizes the cell aiding in healing and cellular regeneration. Why use cold laser therapy? Cold laser therapy is a non-toxic, non-invasive treatment that heals injuries, reduces pain, and decreases inflammation. There are over 1500 published studies on Cold Laser Therapy which prove that when used correctly, this treatment has no negative side effects. Additionally, in comparison with the use of medication for long-term pain management, cold laser therapy is non-addictive and can be used for varying lengths of treatment. Who should use Cold Laser Therapy? Cold laser therapy has been shown to significantly accelerate and enhance the body's natural defenses and recuperative abilities following an injury. If you experience acute or chronic pain, stress disorders, soft tissue strains, sprains, and inflammation then you should consider incorporating cold laser treatment into your treatment plan. Cold laser treatment is commonly used to treat the following conditions: Inflammatory conditions Pain management Connective tissue disorders Joint injuries and disorders Muscle injuries or disorders Neurological injuries or disorders REIKI TREATMENT FOR PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, MENTAL, AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH Reiki or \"Universal Love Energy\" is a therapeutic process of integral healing. The therapist, known as the Reiki Master, channels energy and transfers it to the patient through the hands; harmonizing the patient's physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual bodies. Reiki is a non-physical healing technique that works with the body's natural energies. These energies are generated from the Ki; the force that animates and keeps the health of the body's tissues and organs. Our Ki is directly affected by our conscious and unconscious thoughts and feelings, which when negative, can cause a disruption in the Ki. When the flow of the Ki is disrupted, we may experience illness or unexplained injury. Western medicine acknowledges that as much as 98% of illness is caused directly or indirectly by the mind. As the nervous system is comprised of the brain and spine, which connects directly to all the nerves and corresponding limbs and organs, it stands to reason that our negative thoughts may travel from the brain to our extremities. As negative thoughts accumulate in certain areas of the body, disrupting the Ki, we begin to experience pain, discomfort, or injury in that region of the body. Reiki uses the energy channeled by the Reiki Master to eliminate the Ki-inhibiting thoughts and feelings. This energy, which is inherently healthy and intelligent, flows where it is needed, breaking up and washing away negativity. As the energy is inherently healthy it cannot be used to cause harm and since the energy has its own intelligence, it is not guided by the mind nor is it limited by the experience or ability of the practitioner. As negativity is washed away, a normal healthy flow of Ki returns to the organs and tissues, allowing them to function fully and reducing pain. Call (410) 760-4141 today to "}
