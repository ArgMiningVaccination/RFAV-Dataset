It is important to understand how to use essential oils. Many massage therapists work with essential oils during a massage therapy treatment. [Aromatherapy Massage Therapy ](https://returningbalance.com/index.php/2019/11/19/returning-balance-therapies-new-location/)and different aromatherapy treatment combinations can be most effective for many issues, not only on a physical level, but also mentally and emotionally. Our skin in the largest organ in our bodies. When essential oils are applied to the skin they are absorbed and travel around the body via the bloodstream can deliver a wide range of benefits to the body's systems and organs. What a perfect combination for a massage therapy treatment! It is best to contact someone who is either certified in massage and aromatherapy, or who is a distributor that knows and understands the proper amount and the use of application methods. Essential oils are extracted from parts of plants. These plant parts are distilled. Aromatherapy massage can be applied in several different methods such as nose inhalation, direct application to the skin and vapor. There are also many essential oils in shampoos, conditioners, soaps, bath salts, candles, nasal inhalers, essential oil diffuser and sprays available. Oils can be used by themselves, or combination of different group oils can be used to work together. It is also important to dilute your oils with another oil, such as jojoba or coconut oil in your palm before application to the skin. Oils derived from seeds are the best for skin applications. The Blood Brain Barrier A very important role of Essential Oils is that it passes the blood brain barrier. The Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable border of endothelial cells that prevents solutes in the circulating blood from non-selectively crossing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system where neurons reside. More simply stated; The BBB is semi-permeable; meaning it allows some materials to cross, but prevents others from crossing to protect the brain. In most parts of the body, the smallest blood vessels, called capillaries, are lined with endothelial cells. Endothelial tissue has small spaces between each individual cell so substances can move readily between the inside and the outside of the vessel. However, in our brains, the endothelial cells fit tightly together, and substances cannot pass out of the bloodstream into the brain. This protects our brains. The cellular membrane is composed of lipids. Because essential oils are lipid soluble and small, they easily pass from the blood into the brain. The BBB is the most secure tissue barrier in our bodies. What is the Limbic System About? When we use our nose to smell oils it stimulates the smell receptors in the nose which sends messages through the nervous system, and then to the Limbic System, passing the BBB. The Limbic System is a network of brain structures (amygdala (emotional center), hippocampus (formation of new memories / past experiences), thalamus, hypothalamus, and cingulate gyrus. located beneath the cerebral cortex. The Limbic System is important because it controls our behaviors that are essential to our [well-being](https://returningbalance.com/index.php/2020/01/11/cleanse-and-detox-with-a-professional/) and life such as self-preservation, motivation and emotional behaviors. Frankincense Oil One example of how an oil can help is with Frankincense oil. There have been many case studies using FDA guidelines treating disorders with success, such as seizure disorder, neurological stimulation to improve cognitive function, and others when Frankincense oil is applied directly to the skin and inhaled through the nose. (Journal of Traditional Complementary Medicine in 2013) \"Further studies (according to Essential Oils Desk Reference), have shown that a compound of frankincense resin protects the nervous system and that many of the biochemicals in essential oils, particularly sesquiterpenes, can increase blood oxygen levels in the brain and release negative emotions that have been stored there. Many people with Lyme disease are hypoxic; that is, their body and brain don't receive enough oxygen due to hyper-coagulation and other factors. Frankincense may therefore help to increase oxygenation, while also facilitating the release of negative emotions, which are another common factor in Lyme. Another way in which frankincense may assist with the emotions is by calming and sedating the nervous system through compounds called aldehydes and esters. It may therefore alleviate anxiety that results from inflammation, pathogens and other factors.\" Aromatherapy Massage Therapy Treatments Find out more how Aromatherapy Massage with Essential Oils can benefit you and improve your health and wellness.
