Unlike many other treatment methods, there are no side effects. Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Centers for Complementary and Integrated Health, a branch of National Institutes of Health (NIH) acknowledge the benefits of acupuncture. Acupuncture practitioners recognize that vital life energy, Qi, circulates within the body through a series of pathways called meridians. The meridians transport Qi providing nourishment to every cell, tissue, muscle, organ and gland in the body. A blockage or excessive flow of energy through one or more meridians may lead to a variety of health problems including acute or chronic pain. By stimulating acupuncture points along specific meridians, we can break up the blockages or slow the flow of excess energy by insertion of fine, sterile needles. Acupuncture is especially helpful as an adjunct to chiropractic adjustments, stretching, yoga and massage. A typical acupuncture treatment will last 30-60 minutes and is usually painless. Common health problems that respond to acupuncture are tension-type and migraine headaches, low back pain with or without sciatica, neck pain and stiffness, knee pain, and shoulder pain, among others. Please contact us if you would like to discuss acupuncture as an alternative method of pain management. "}
