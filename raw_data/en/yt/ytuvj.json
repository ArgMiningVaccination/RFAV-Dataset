It should be noted that some rotation sites may not accept the QuantiFERON Gold Blood Test. Tetanus Toxoid, Diphtheria Toxoid, and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (Tdap) All students are required to have had a Tetanus Toxoid, Diphtheria Toxoid, and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine (Tdap) booster prior to matriculation and must maintain immunity by continuing to remain current, according to the CDC recommendations for health care personnel, during their program. Due to the increased risk of pertussis in a health care setting, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices highly recommends that health care workers receive a one-time Tdap (ask your health care provider). Tdap is required, without regard to interval of previous dose of Tetanus-Toxoid (Td). Varicella (Chicken Pox) One of the following is required: proof of two vaccinations or positive antibody titer. (Lab report is required.) Any Other Vaccinations Required by Clinical Sites Clinical practicum or rotation sites may require additional immunizations not listed above. Students should contact their dean or program director for further information regarding site-specific immunization requirements. Arrangements: Students may request that the Student Medical Center administer these immunizations. Students may call (954) 262-4100 to make an appointment. Once made, the appointment becomes the student's obligation and must be kept. For students at other NSU campuses, appointments may be scheduled with the NSU-designated physician for their area. Students may request that the NSU Clinic Pharmacy administer the influenza vaccination. Students are financially responsible for all required immunizations. Failure to comply: The university is not required to provide alternative sites for clinical practicum or rotations should immunization be a requirement for placement. Therefore, failure to comply with this policy may result in students' inability to satisfy the graduation requirements in their programs. Relative to clinical rotation site requirements, students are expected to consult their specific college/ program handbooks for compliance with any college/program-specific requirements. Urine Drug Screen HPD students may be required to submit to urine drug screen testing. Students who test positive for illegal or illicit drugs, such as marijuana (even if prescribed or certified by a physician), or for a controlled substance they do not have a prescription for, will be referred to their college's appropriate committee. Certain colleges may have additional policies. Students are expected to check the college section of their student handbook for "}
