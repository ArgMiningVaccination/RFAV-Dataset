Administer the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine intramuscularly. After dilution, vials of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with orange caps and labels with orange borders contain 10 doses of 0.2 mL of vaccine. Low dead-volume syringes and/or needles can be used to extract 10 doses from a single vial. If standard syringes and needles are used, there may not be sufficient volume to extract 10 doses from a single vial. Irrespective of the type of syringe and needle: - Each dose must contain 0.2 mL of vaccine. - If the amount of vaccine remaining in the vial cannot provide a full dose of 0.2 mL, discard the vial and content. - Do not pool excess vaccine from multiple vials. Contraindications Do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to individuals with known history of a severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (see [Full EUA Prescribing Information](#full_eua)). Warnings Management of Acute Allergic Reactions Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Monitor Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html). Myocarditis and Pericarditis Postmarketing data with authorized or approved monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within the first week following receipt of the second primary series dose or first booster dose, with most booster doses likely administered at least 5 months after completing primary vaccination. For the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, the observed risk is higher among adolescent males and adult males under 40 years of age than among females and older males, and the observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management. Information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae. The CDC has published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination, including for vaccination of individuals with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html). Syncope Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, in particular in adolescents. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Limitation of Effectiveness Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine may not protect all vaccine recipients. Adverse Reactions Adverse Reactions in Clinical Trials Adverse reactions in children 5 through 11 years of age following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine included pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, injection site redness, injection site swelling, muscle pain, chills, fever, joint pain, lymphadenopathy, nausea, rash, malaise, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and vomiting (see [Full EUA Prescribing Information](#full_eua)). Adverse Reactions Identified in Post Authorization Experience Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., rash, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema), diarrhea, vomiting, pain in extremity (arm), syncope, and dizziness have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Additional adverse reactions, some of which may be serious, may become apparent with more widespread use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.

Warnings and Precautions 5.1 Management of Acute Allergic Reactions Appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs following administration of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Monitor Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients for the occurrence of immediate adverse reactions according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/managing-anaphylaxis.html). 5.2 Myocarditis and Pericarditis Postmarketing data with authorized or approved monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines demonstrate increased risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly within the first week following receipt of the second primary series dose or first booster dose, with most booster doses likely administered at least 5 months after completing primary vaccination. For the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, the observed risk is higher among adolescent males and adult males under 40 years of age than among females and older males, and the observed risk is highest in males 12 through 17 years of age. Although some cases required intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that most individuals have had resolution of symptoms with conservative management. Information is not yet available about potential long-term sequelae. The CDC has published considerations related to myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination, including for vaccination of individuals with a history of myocarditis or pericarditis (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/myocarditis.html). 5.3 Syncope Syncope (fainting) may occur in association with administration of injectable vaccines, in particular in adolescents. Procedures should be in place to avoid injury from fainting. 5.4 Altered Immunocompetence Immunocompromised persons, including individuals receiving immunosuppressant therapy, may have a diminished immune response to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. 6. Adverse Reactions/Side Effects It is MANDATORY for vaccination providers to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) all vaccine administration errors, all serious adverse events, cases of myocarditis, cases of pericarditis, cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults and children, and hospitalized or fatal cases of COVID-19 following vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. [7](#footnote-7) To the extent feasible, provide a copy of the VAERS form to Pfizer Inc. Please see the [REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS](#S8) section for details on reporting to VAERS and Pfizer Inc. - [7](#footnote-reference-7) - Vaccination providers administering COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) must adhere to the same reporting requirements. Primary Series In a clinical study in children 5 through 11 years of age who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine containing 10 mcg of a nucleoside-modified messenger RNA encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 (10 mcg modRNA), adverse reactions following administration of any primary series dose included pain at the injection site (84.3%), fatigue (51.7%), headache (38.2%), injection site redness (26.4%), injection site swelling (20.4%), muscle pain (17.5%), chills (0.3%), malaise (0.1%), and decreased appetite (0.1%). Post Authorization Experience Severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Primary Series The safety of the primary series Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was evaluated in participants 5 years of age and older in 3 clinical studies conducted in the United States, Europe, Turkey, South Africa, and South America. Study BNT162-01 (Study 1) was a Phase 1/2, 2-part, dose-escalation trial that enrolled 60 participants, 18 through 55 years of age. Study C4591001 (Study 2) is a Phase placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection (Phase 1) and efficacy (Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled approximately 46,000 participants, 12 years of age or older. Of these, approximately 43,448 participants [21,720 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA); 21,728 placebo] in Phase 2/3 are 16 years of age or older (including 138 and 145 adolescents 16 and 17 years of age in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively) and 2,260 adolescents are 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 and 1,129 in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively). Study C4591007 (Study 3) is a Phase 1/2/3 multicenter, observer-blind, immunogenicity and efficacy (Phase 2/3) study that has enrolled 4,695 participants 5 through 11 years of age, of whom 3109 participants received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and 1538 participants received placebo in Phase 2/3. In Study 2 and Study 3, all participants 5 through 11 years of age, 12 through 15 years of age, and 16 years of age and older in the reactogenicity subset, were monitored for solicited local and systemic reactions and use of antipyretic medication after each vaccination in an electronic diary. Participants are being monitored for unsolicited adverse events, including serious adverse events, throughout the study [from Dose 1 through 1 month (all unsolicited adverse events) after the last vaccination or 6 months (serious adverse events) after the last vaccination]. Tables 1 and 2 present the frequency and severity of solicited local and systemic reactions, respectively, within 7 days following each dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and placebo in children 5 through 11 years of age. Children 5 Through 11 Years of Age In an analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3, based on data up to the cutoff date of September 06, 2021, 2,268 participants [1,518 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA); 750 placebo] were 5 through 11 years of age. Of these, 2,158 (95.1%) [1,444 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and 714 placebo] participants have been followed for at least 2 months after the second dose. An analysis of Study 3 Phase 2/3 adverse event data also included another 2,379 participants [1,591 Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and 788 placebo], of whom 71.2% had a follow-up period for at least 2 weeks after Dose 2 up to the cutoff date of October 8, 2021. The safety evaluation in Study 3 is ongoing. Demographic characteristics in Study 3 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants 5 through 11 years of age who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and those who received placebo. Among the 4,647 participants 5 through 11 years of age who received at least 1 dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) or placebo, 51.8% were male and 48.2% were female, 77.3% were White, 5.8% were Black or African American, 16.9% were Hispanic/Latino, 8.3% were Asian, and 0.4% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Reactions The mean duration of pain at the injection site after Dose 2 was 2.3 days (range 1 to 11 days), for redness 2.2 days (range 1 to 10 days), and for swelling 2.2 days (range 1 to 10 days) for children in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) group up to the cutoff date of September 06, 2021. |Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine| Dose 1 N n Dose 1 N [](#footnote-10), [\u00b6](#footnote-12)=748 n [\u00a7](#footnote-11)(%) [](#footnote-9) Dose 2 N [](#footnote-10), [\u00b6](#footnote-12)=740 n [\u00a7](#footnote-11)(%) - [*](#footnote-reference-8) - Randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of the study intervention. - [](#footnote-reference-9) - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA). - [](#footnote-reference-10) - N = Number of participants reporting at least 1 yes or no response for the specified reaction after the specified dose. - [\u00a7](#footnote-reference-11) - n = Number of participants with the specified reaction. - [\u00b6](#footnote-reference-12) - The denominators (N) used in the percentage calculations for redness and swelling were 749 after Dose 1 and 741 after Dose 2 in the placebo group, due to an e-diary error. - [#](#footnote-reference-13) - Mild: 0.5 >7.0 with activity; Moderate: [\u00de](#footnote-14) |Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Dose 1 1 N [](#footnote-17), [\u00b6](#footnote-19)=748 n [\u00a7](#footnote-18)(%) [](#footnote-16) Dose 2 N [](#footnote-17), [\u00b6](#footnote-12)=740 n [\u00a7](#footnote-18)(%) - [*](#footnote-reference-15) - Randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of the study intervention. - [](#footnote-reference-16) - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA). - [](#footnote-reference-17) - N = Number of participants reporting at least 1 yes or no response for the specified event after the specified dose. - [\u00a7](#footnote-reference-18) - n = Number of participants with the specified reaction. - [\u00b6](#footnote-reference-19) - The denominators (N) used in the percentage calculations for fever and use of antipyretic or pain medication were 749 after Dose 1 and 741 after Dose 2 in the placebo group, due to an e-diary error. - [#](#footnote-reference-20) - Mild: does not interfere with activity; Moderate: some interference with activity; Severe: prevents daily activity. - [\u00de](#footnote-reference-21) - Mild: 1 to 2 times in 24 hours; >2 in - [\u00df](#footnote-reference-22) - Mild: 2 to 3 loose stools in 24 hours; Moderate: 4 to 5 loose stools in 24 hours; Severe: 6 or more loose stools in 24 hours. - [\u00e0](#footnote-reference-23) - Severity was not collected for use of antipyretic [\u00e0](#footnote-23) Unsolicited Adverse Events In the following analyses of Study 3 in children 5 through 11 years of age (1,518 of whom received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) and 750 of whom received placebo), 99.5% of participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Serious Adverse Events In 1 group of participants (initial enrollment cohort) with a median of 2.3 months follow-up post Dose 2, no serious adverse events were reported that were considered related to vaccination. In a second group of participants (expansion cohort) with a median of 2.4 weeks follow-up post Dose 2, no serious adverse events were reported that were considered related to vaccination. Non-Serious Adverse Events In 1 group of participants (initial enrollment cohort), non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 up to the cutoff date of September 06, 2021, in ongoing follow-up were reported by 10.9% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) recipients and by 9.1% of placebo recipients. In this group of participants, >99% had follow-up 30 days post Dose 2. In a second group of participants (expansion cohort) for which the median follow-up was 2.4 weeks (range 0 - 3.7 weeks), non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through the cutoff date of October 8, 2021, were reported by 7.1% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) recipients and by 6.3% of placebo recipients. In the initial enrollment cohort, from Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, lymphadenopathy was reported in 13 (0.9%) participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) group vs. 1 (0.1%) in the placebo group. In the expansion cohort from Dose 1 through the cutoff date, lymphadenopathy was reported in 6 (0.4%) participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (10 mcg modRNA) group vs. 3 (0.4%) in the placebo group. There were no other notable patterns between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Adolescents 12 Through 15 Years of Age In an analysis of Study 2, based on data up to the cutoff date of March 13, 2021, 2,260 adolescents [1,131 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA); 1,129 placebo] were 12 through 15 years of age. Of these, 1,308 (660 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 648 placebo) adolescents have been followed for at least 2 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among adolescents who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the adolescents who received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, 50.1% were male and 49.9% were female, 85.9% were White, 4.6% were Black or African American, 11.7% were Hispanic/Latino, 6.4% were Asian, and 0.4% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Unsolicited Adverse Events In the following analyses of Study 2 in adolescents 12 through 15 years of age (1,131 of whom received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 1,129 of whom received placebo), 98.3% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Serious Adverse Events Serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.1% of placebo recipients. There were no notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Non-Serious Adverse Events Non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 5.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 5.8% of placebo recipients. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy plausibly related to the study intervention were imbalanced, with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (7) vs. the placebo group (1). There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Participants 16 Years of Age and Older At the time of the analysis of Study 2 for the EUA, 37,586 [18,801 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA) and 18,785 placebo] participants 16 years of age or older had been followed for a median of 2 months after the second dose. The safety evaluation in Study 2 is ongoing. The safety population includes participants 16 years and older enrolled by October 9, 2020, and includes safety data accrued through November 14, 2020. Demographic characteristics in Study 2 were generally similar with regard to age, gender, race, and ethnicity among participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and those who received placebo. Overall, among the total participants who received either the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, 50.6% were male and 49.4% were female, 83.1% were White, 9.1% were Black or African American, 28.0% were Hispanic/Latino, 4.3% were Asian, and 0.5% were American Indian/Alaska Native. Unsolicited Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events In Study 2, among participants 16 through 55 years of age who had received at least 1 dose of vaccine or placebo (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 10,841; placebo = 10,851), serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported by 0.4% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.3% of placebo recipients. In a similar analysis, in participants 56 years of age and older (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine = 7,960, placebo = 7,934), serious adverse events were reported by 0.8% of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients and by 0.6% of placebo recipients who received at least 1 dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine or placebo, respectively. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. Appendicitis was reported as a serious adverse event for 12 participants, and numerically higher in the vaccine group, 8 vaccine participants and 4 placebo participants. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of serious adverse events (including neurologic, neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Non-Serious Adverse Events In Study 2 in which 10,841 participants 16 through 55 years of age received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 10,851 participants received placebo, non-serious adverse events from Dose 1 through up to 30 days after Dose 2 in ongoing follow-up were reported in 29.3% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 13.2% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. Overall in a similar analysis in which 7,960 participants 56 years of age and older received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, non-serious adverse events within 30 days were reported in 23.8% of participants who received Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and 11.7% of participants in the placebo group, for participants who received at least 1 dose. In these analyses, 91.6% of study participants had at least 30 days of follow-up after Dose 2. The higher frequency of reported unsolicited non-serious adverse events among Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine recipients compared to placebo recipients was primarily attributed to local and systemic adverse events reported during the first 7 days following vaccination that are consistent with adverse reactions solicited among participants in the reactogenicity subset. From Dose 1 through 30 days after Dose 2, reports of lymphadenopathy were imbalanced with notably more cases in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group (64) vs. the placebo group (6), which is plausibly related to vaccination. Throughout the safety follow-up period to date, Bell's palsy (facial paralysis) was reported by 4 participants in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group. Onset of facial paralysis was Day 37 after Dose 1 (participant did not receive Dose 2) and Days 3, 9, and 48 after Dose 2. No cases of Bell's palsy were reported in the placebo group. Currently available information is insufficient to determine a causal relationship with the vaccine. There were no other notable patterns or numerical imbalances between treatment groups for specific categories of non-serious adverse events (including other neurologic or neuro-inflammatory, and thrombotic events) that would suggest a causal relationship to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. 6.2 Post Authorization Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post authorization use of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to vaccine exposure. Cardiac Disorders: myocarditis, pericarditis Gastrointestinal Disorders: diarrhea, vomiting Immune System Disorders: severe allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, and other hypersensitivity reactions rash, pruritus, and (arm) Nervous System Disorders: syncope, dizziness 8 REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS AND VACCINE ADMINISTRATION ERRORS8 See [Overall Safety Summary (Section 6)](#S6) for additional information.

Drug Interactions There are no data to assess the concomitant administration of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine with other vaccines. 11. Use In Specific Populations 11.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Available data on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccine-associated risks in pregnancy. In a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, 0.06 mL of a vaccine formulation containing the same quantity of nucleoside-modified messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (30 mcg) and other ingredients included in a single human dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered to female rats by the intramuscular route on 4 occasions: 21 and 14 days prior to mating, and on gestation days 9 and 20. No vaccine-related adverse effects on female fertility, fetal development, or postnatal development were reported in the study. 11.2 Lactation 11.3 Pediatric Use Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized for use in individuals 6 months through 17 years of age. This authorization is based on safety and effectiveness data in this age group and adults. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is not authorized for use in individuals younger than 6 months of age. 11.4 Use in Immunocompromised Safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in children with immunocompromise has been extrapolated from adult data. An independent report (Kamar N, Abravanel F, Marion O, et al. Three doses of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in solid-organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med) described the safety and effectiveness of a third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in adult persons that received solid organ transplants. In this report describing 99 individuals who had undergone various solid organ transplant procedures (heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas) 97\u00b18 months previously who received a third vaccine dose, the adverse event profile was similar to that after the second dose and no grade 3 or grade 4 events were reported in recipients who were followed for 1 month following post Dose 3. The administration of a third dose of vaccine appears to be only moderately effective in increasing potentially protective antibody titers. Patients should still be counselled to maintain physical precautions to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, close contacts of immunocompromised persons should be vaccinated as appropriate for their health status. 13.

Covid-19 Vaccine Pfizer, Monovalent,5 yr to 11 yr - Clinical Pharmacology 18 CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTS AND SUPPORTING DATA FOR EUA 18.1 Efficacy of Primary Series in Participants 16 Years of Age and Older Study 2 is a multicenter, multinational, Phase 1/2/3, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-finding, vaccine candidate-selection, and efficacy study in participants 12 years of age and older. Randomization was stratified by age: 12 through 15 years of age, 16 through 55 years of age, or 56 years of age and older, with a minimum of 40% of participants in the 56-year stratum. The study excluded participants who were immunocompromised and those who had previous clinical or microbiological diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants with preexisting stable disease, defined as disease not requiring significant change in therapy or hospitalization for worsening disease during the 6 weeks before enrollment, were included as were participants with known stable infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or hepatitis B virus (HBV). In the Phase 2/3 portion of Study 2, based on data accrued through November 14, 2020, approximately 44,000 participants 12 years of age and older were randomized equally and received 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA) or placebo separated by 21 days. Participants are planned to be followed for up to 24 months, for assessments of safety and efficacy against COVID-19. The population for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included, 36,621 participants 12 years of age and older (18,242 in the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine group and 18,379 in the placebo group) who did not have evidence of prior infection with SARS-CoV-2 through 7 days after the second dose. Table 5 presents the specific demographic characteristics in the studied population. |Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine| (N=18,242) n (%) (N=18,379) n (%) - [*](#footnote-reference-25) - All eligible randomized participants who receive all vaccination(s) as randomized within the predefined window, have no other important protocol deviations as determined by the clinician, and have no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection prior to 7 days after Dose 2. - [](#footnote-reference-26) - Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (30 mcg modRNA). - [](#footnote-reference-27) - 100 participants 12 through 15 years of age with limited follow-up in the randomized population received at least 1 dose (49 in the vaccine group and 51 in the placebo group).

From an independent report (Kamar N, Abravanel F, Marion O, et al. Three doses of an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine in solid-organ transplant recipients. N Engl J Med), a single arm study has been conducted in 101 individuals who had undergone various solid organ transplant procedures (heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas) 97\u00b18 months previously. A third dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was administered to 99 of these individuals approximately 2 months after they had received a second dose. Among the 59 patients who had been seronegative before the third dose, 26 (44%) were seropositive at 4 weeks after the third dose. All 40 patients who had been seropositive before the third dose were still seropositive 4 weeks later. The prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 68% (67 of 99 patients) 4 weeks after the third dose. 19. How is Covid-19 Vaccine Pfizer, Monovalent,5 yr to 11 yr supplied The information in this section applies to the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine that is supplied in multiple dose vials with orange caps and labels with orange borders. These multiple dose vials are supplied in a carton containing 10 multiple dose vials (NDC 59267-1055-4). After dilution, 1 vial contains 10 doses of 0.2 mL. During storage, minimize exposure to room light, and avoid exposure to direct sunlight and ultraviolet light. Do not refreeze thawed vials. Vial Storage Prior to Use Cartons of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine multiple dose vials with orange caps and labels with orange borders may arrive frozen at ultra-cold conditions in thermal containers with dry ice. Once received, frozen vials may be immediately transferred to the refrigerator [2\u00baC to 8\u00baC (35\u00baF to 46\u00baF)], thawed and stored for up to 10 weeks. The 10-week refrigerated expiry date should be recorded on the carton at the time of transfer. A carton of 10 vials may take up to 4 hours to thaw at this temperature. Alternatively, frozen vials may be stored in an ultra-low temperature freezer at -90\u00baC to -60\u00baC (-130\u00baF to -76\u00baF) for up to 18 months from the date of manufacture. Do not store vials at -25\u00b0C to -15\u00b0C (-13\u00b0F to 5\u00b0F). Once vials are thawed, they should not be refrozen. If cartons of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine multiple dose vials with orange caps and labels with orange borders are received at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (35\u00baF to 46\u00baF), they should be stored at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (35\u00baF to 46\u00baF). Check that the carton has been updated to reflect the 10-week refrigerated expiry date. Regardless of storage condition, the vaccine should not be used after 18 months from the date of manufacture printed on the vial and cartons.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOUR CHILD GETS ANY OF THESE VACCINES WHAT IS COVID-19? COVID-19 disease is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. You can get COVID-19 through contact with another person who has the virus. It is predominantly a respiratory illness that can affect other organs. People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness leading to death. Symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Symptoms may include: fever or chills; cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; muscle body new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting; diarrhea. HOW ARE THE PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE AND THE PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, BIVALENT RELATED? The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent is made in the same way as Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine but it also contains an Omicron component to help prevent COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. For more information on EUA, see the \" [What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?](#what)\" section at the end of this Fact Sheet. WHAT SHOULD YOU MENTION TO YOUR CHILD'S VACCINATION PROVIDER BEFORE YOUR CHILD GETS ANY OF THESE VACCINES? Tell the vaccination provider about all of your child's medical conditions, including if your child: - has any allergies - has had myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) or pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) - has a fever - has a bleeding disorder or is on a blood thinner - is immunocompromised or is on a medicine that affects your child's immune system - is pregnant - is breastfeeding - has received another COVID-19 vaccine - has ever fainted in association with an injection HOW ARE THESE VACCINES GIVEN? The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent will be given to your child as an injection into the muscle. Primary Series: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is given for the primary series. The vaccine is administered as a 2-dose series, 3 weeks apart. A third primary series dose may be administered at least 28 days after the second dose to individuals with certain kinds of immunocompromise. Booster Dose: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent is administered as a single booster dose at least 2 months after: - completion of primary vaccination with any authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine; or - receipt of the most recent booster dose with any authorized or approved monovalent COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccine may not protect everyone. WHO SHOULD NOT GET THE PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE OR THE PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, BIVALENT? Your child should not get any of these vaccines if your child: - had a severe allergic reaction after a previous dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. - had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in these vaccines. WHAT ARE THE INGREDIENTS IN THESE VACCINES? The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and sodium chloride. HAVE THESE VACCINES BEEN USED BEFORE? In a clinical trial, approximately 3,100 individuals 5 through 11 years of age have received at least 1 dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Millions of individuals have received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine under EUA since December 11, 2020. In a clinical trial, approximately 300 individuals greater than 55 years of age received 1 dose of a bivalent vaccine that differs from the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent in that it contains a different Omicron component. WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THESE VACCINES? The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has been shown to prevent COVID-19. FDA has authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent to provide better protection against COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2. The duration of protection against COVID-19 is currently unknown. WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THESE VACCINES? There is a remote chance that these vaccines could cause a severe allergic reaction. A severe allergic reaction would usually occur within a few minutes to 1 hour after getting a dose. For this reason, your child's vaccination provider may ask your child to stay at the place where your child received the vaccine for monitoring after vaccination. Signs of a severe allergic reaction can include: - Difficulty breathing - Swelling of the face and throat - A fast heartbeat - A bad rash all over the body - Dizziness and weakness Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) have occurred in some people who have received the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent. In most of these people, symptoms began within a few days following receipt of the second dose of vaccine. The chance of having this occur is very low. You should seek medical attention right away if your child has any of the following symptoms after receiving the vaccine: - Chest pain - Shortness of breath - Feelings of having a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart Side effects that have been reported with these vaccines include: - Severe allergic reactions - Non-severe allergic reactions such as rash, itching, hives, or swelling of the face - Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) - Pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) - Injection site pain - Tiredness - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Joint pain - Fever - Injection site swelling - Injection site redness - Nausea - Feeling unwell - Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy) - Decreased appetite - Diarrhea - Vomiting - Arm pain - Fainting in association with injection of the vaccine - Dizziness These may not be all the possible side effects of these vaccines. Serious and unexpected side effects may occur. The possible side effects of these vaccines are still being studied. WHAT SHOULD I DO ABOUT SIDE EFFECTS? If your child experiences a severe allergic reaction, call 9-1-1, or go to the nearest hospital. Call the vaccination provider or your child's healthcare provider if your child has any side effects that bother your child or do not go away.

Individuals becoming aware of any potential violations of the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program requirements are encouraged to report them to the Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, at 1-800-HHS-TIPS or https://TIPS.HHS.GOV. WHAT IS THE COUNTERMEASURES INJURY COMPENSATION PROGRAM? The Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program (CICP) is a federal program that may help pay for costs of medical care and other specific expenses of certain people who have been seriously injured by certain medicines or vaccines, including these vaccines. Generally, a claim must be submitted to the CICP within one (1) year from the date of receiving the vaccine. To learn more about this program, visit www.hrsa.gov/cicp/ or call 1-855-266-2427. [WHAT IS AN EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION (EUA)? ] An EUA is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical products, including vaccines, during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. An EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic. A product authorized for emergency use has not undergone the same type of review by FDA as an FDA-approved product. FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of the scientific evidence available showing that the product may be effective to prevent COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks of the product. All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used during the COVID-19 pandemic.
