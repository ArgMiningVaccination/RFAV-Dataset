Article 14 TRANSFERS Change of Shift Within Work Location 14.01 Prior to considering a transfer under this Article and prior to issuing a Job Posting under Article 15, a new or vacant day, afternoon or night shift(s) shall be offered to qualified employee(s) in order of seniority in the classification within the work location, unless the employee has indicated in writing they do not wish to be considered for such shift. Employee Requests for Transfer The parties agree that the following language will supersede any and all divisional or Corporate transfer policies: 14.02(a) An employee wishing a transfer within his/her division and same classification to another location, shall submit a request in writing to his/her Division Head. 14.02(b) An employee wishing a transfer outside his/her division (within the same classification) to the same or another location, shall submit a request in writing to the Human Resources Division. 14.02(c) An employee wishing a transfer to a temporary assignment of one year or more in another location within his/her same classification within his/her division shall submit a request in writing to his/her Division Head. 14.02(d) Once an employee submits a transfer request in writing, it shall remain on file until he/she is transferred, refuses the transfer or withdraws the transfer request. The City will acknowledge in writing to the employee receipt of such request for transfer within fourteen (14) days of receipt. 14.02(e) All transfers under this article shall be offered to qualified employees in order of seniority in the classification, taking operational needs into consideration.

Transfers To Temporary Assignments 14.04(a) Where the City establishes a temporary assignment of one year or more, such opportunity shall first be offered to employees in the same classification within the Division who have submitted a transfer request form indicating their request for consideration for a temporary transfer. 14.04(b) Once such transfer has been offered and accepted, the employee will remain in that assignment for the agreed duration and will not be permitted to transfer until such assignment is completed.

Reorganization/Service Consolidation - Related Transfers 14.05 The City recognizes that a change in an employee's permanent work location may have an effect upon employees. The City further recognizes that Local 79 has a legitimate interest in ensuring that their members are treated in a reasonable and consistent manner where it becomes necessary to transfer employees on a permanent basis within the context of the City's reorganization/service consolidation activities. In this regard, where such transfers are to take place, and consistent with the City's operational requirements, the following guideline will apply: 1. Local 79 will be notified in writing prior to the scheduled transfer of staff, including an invitation to meet and discuss issues arising from the transfer. Wherever possible, such notice will be at least four (4) weeks prior to the scheduled transfer(s). 2. Employees will also be given written notice of their reassignment (or the potential for reassignment, if not all employees will be similarly affected). Wherever possible, such notice will be at least four (4) weeks prior to the scheduled transfer(s). 3. When a reassignment does not affect all employees, or where the reassignment involves more than one new location, where qualifications meet the operational needs of the location(s), seniority will be the determining factor in making such reassignments. The foregoing procedure does not prevent Local 79 from requesting a meeting to discuss issues relating to staff movement in circumstances which are not covered by the above procedure. If requested, such meeting shall be arranged and held as quickly as possible. - 50 - Rebuilding or Building a Long Term Care Home 14.06 If the City of Toronto rebuilds a Long Term Care Home or builds a new Long Term Care Home that necessitates the movement of residents, full-time staff and part-time staff, the City will meet with Local 79 to review the capital project plans and staff redeployment plan prior to implementation. The staff redeployment plan will include how the multiple criteria of continuity of resident care, recognition of special resident needs and staff seniority will be addressed. The parties will make best efforts to negotiate a mutually acceptable Memorandum of Agreement to guide the redeployment of staff.

Assessments 15.05(a) The Executive Director of Human Resources and the Division Head concerned will decide jointly on the need for an examination(s) for the purpose of determining qualified candidates for the permanent position and/or temporary assignment. Should passing an exam be required to qualify for a particular permanent position and/or temporary assignment, it will be conducted in a manner that will provide a fair assessment of those candidates being assessed using the same set of standards. 15.05(b) Examinations will take the form of written test(s), practical, physical / skill tests, interview panel or any combination thereof to ensure candidates are examined for the qualifications and skills considered most important to the permanent position and/or temporary assignment. 15.05(c) Where an applicant has performed the duties of the specific permanent position and/or temporary assignment that is the subject of the Job Posting, for at least one (1) year or the equivalent aggregate hours, and the employee has performed this work within the six (6) months preceding the Job Posting, then the candidate will be deemed to be qualified and will not be required to participate in an assessment. 15.05(d) Where there are more candidates than required to fill the posted vacancies, the Executive Director of Human Resources and the Division Head may jointly determine that not all candidates will be assessed. In this case, the most senior candidates will be assessed. Upon request by the union, the City shall provide the number of Local 79 applicants and a list of Local 79 applicants, in seniority order, who were assessed.- 53 - 15.06 Should an examination(s) be required, candidates will be advised in writing by the Executive Director of Human Resources of the type of examination(s) and when and where the examination(s) will be conducted. 15.07 Interview panel members will jointly complete a candidate evaluation form. Evaluation forms will be retained by the Executive Director of Human Resources and copies will be available for review by the Human Resources Division with the approval of the candidate within forty-five (45) days of being advised of the interview panel decision. Candidate evaluation forms completed on a candidate for a specific position will have no relevancy to any other position for which an employee might apply. The Interview Panel is responsible for qualifying candidates for the position. 15.08 Within forty-five (45) days of notification of the results of his/her examination and upon request to the Executive Director of Human Resources, candidate(s) will receive feedback on his/her interview and/or review his/her test paper, by appointment with staff of the Human Resources Division. 15.09 Candidates who do not comply with the procedures and guidelines established for conducting examinations shall be disqualified from further consideration as a candidate. 15.10 Upon completion of the examination(s), the Executive Director of Human Resources will advise all candidates in writing of their results, and will forward to the Division concerned, in order of seniority, the names and seniority dates of the successful candidates for selection. 15.11(a) The selection decision will be based upon the criteria as set out in sub- clause 15.01(a) hereof. If other than the senior candidate(s) from the list of candidate(s) who meet the required qualifications is selected, the Division Head will advise the Executive Director of Human Resources in writing, giving reasonable justification for the selection of candidate(s) with less seniority. Such justification must demonstrate a fair and objective basis for the selection decision and for the separation between the successful candidate(s) and the unsuccessful senior candidate(s). 15.11(b) The Executive Director of Human Resources will notify all candidates who were not selected for the permanent position and/or temporary assignment. Where a less senior candidate is selected, candidates with greater seniority shall be provided with the Division Head's justification. 15.12(a) A list of the qualified candidates from each Job Posting shall be either: (i) a Candidate List which shall only be valid for the filling of the posted permanent position and/or temporary assignment, or (i) an Eligibility List which shall be valid for the filling of future permanent positions and/or temporary assignments in the specific position(s) that were the subject of the Job Posting during the period that the Eligibility List is in effect. Upon request an electronic list of qualified candidates and their seniority will be supplied to Local 79 for any specific job posting . The identity of non-Local 79 candidates will not be included. 15.12(b) The Candidate List or Eligibility List will be formed in accordance with clauses 15.04 or 15.10, as the case may be. Eligibility Lists will become effective upon receipt by the Division concerned. Subject to sub-clause (f) below, Eligibility Lists will be used to select the successful candidate for each - 54 - successive permanent position and/or temporary assignment which arises during the period that the Eligibility List is in effect. 15.12(c) An Eligibility List shall remain in effect for six (6) months unless depleted before that time. If the Eligibility List is depleted, or upon the expiry of the six (6) months, whichever comes first, any permanent position and/or temporary assignment in question shall be the subject of further Job Posting(s). 15.12(d) Notwithstanding the first sentence of clause 15.01(a), further Job Postings shall not be issued for the permanent position and/or temporary assignment in question during the period the Eligibility List is in effect. 15.12(e) Each selection decision for the Job Posting shall be made in accordance with clause 15.11 from the candidates on the Candidates List or Eligibility List. Should a less senior candidate be chosen from the Candidate List or Eligibility list, the candidates with greater seniority shall be notified. 15.12(f) Candidates on the Eligibility List shall have the right to decline an offered permanent position and/or temporary assignment once. In the event that a candidate on the Eligibility List declines a second offered permanent position and/or temporary assignment, his/her name shall be struck from the Eligibility List and he/she shall not be considered for any future permanent positions and/or temporary assignment during the remainder of the period that the Eligibility List is in effect. In the event that all candidates on an Eligibility List decline the same offered permanent position and/or temporary assignment, the City shall have the right to fill the permanent position and/or temporary assignment externally without any obligation to re-post it. 15.12(g) Eligibility lists will only be established by the City in respect to Job Postings where: (i) a large number of placements are anticipated in the specific permanent position and/or temporary assignment that are the subject of the Job Posting in question during the six (6) months following issue of the Job Posting; (ii) a high turnover is anticipated in the specific permanent position and/or temporary assignment that is the subject of the Job Posting in question during the six (6) months following the issue of the Job Posting. Reversion Period 15.13(a) All successful candidates in either a permanent position and/or temporary assignment shall be subject to a three (3) month assessment period which will be extended when an employee is absent in excess of ten (10) working days during the period of assessment. In this case, the assessment period will be extended by the length of the absence. 15.13(b) A joint performance review will be conducted between the employee and the Division Head after the employee's first six (6) weeks in his/her new permanent position and/or temporary assignment to evaluate the employee's performance and suitability or to determine the possibility of reversion. 15.13(c) Should the permanent position and/or temporary assignment be confirmed, the three (3) month assessment period shall count toward the six (6) month probationary period defined in Article 4 if said employee had not completed such period prior to promotion. 15.13(d) Should a reversion be necessary, the three (3) month assessment period or any part thereof served in his/her new permanent position and/or temporary - 55 - assignment shall not count towards the six (6) month Probationary Period if said employee had not completed his/her Probationary Period prior to promotion as set out in Article 4. 15.14(a) Should a reversion be necessary or requested by an employee who was a permanent employee prior to his/her promotion to either a permanent position or temporary assignment, the employee shall be reverted to his/ her former position and wage rate, if the position has not been filled during the interim period. If the former position has been filled, the employee will be reverted to a position reflecting the wage rate earned by the employee prior to the placement. The time served in the position prior to his/her promotion to either a permanent position or temporary assignment will count towards the service required to qualify for an increment as set out in clauses 6.03 and 6.04 of Article 6. 15.14(b) Should no substitute position be available for such permanent employee, a supernumerary position at the pre-placement wage rate will be created for the employee until such time as a position becomes available. The time served in his/her former position prior to his/her promotion to either a permanent position or temporary assignment will count towards the service required to qualify for an increment as set out in clauses 6.03 and 6.04 of Article 6. 15.15 Any employee who is no longer capable of performing his/her full required duties by reason of disability, may be placed in a suitable position, if such position is available, on the recommendation of the Executive Director of Human Resources without regard to the other clauses of this Article. Scheduling of Examinations 15.16 Whenever possible, examinations will be held during working hours. The Division Head will grant leave of absence with pay to those employees in the Division who have made application for and have been accepted for admission to such examinations. For employees subject to shift work, every effort will be made by the Division Head to re-schedule the employees so that the employees will not be required to work a shift immediately before or after an examination.

ARTICLE III FACTORS OF JOB DESCRIPTION AND RATING 3.01 The job description serves to record the conditions from which the job is rated and, from time to time, to judge significant changes in job content which result from new or changed circumstances. 3.02 The description of a job shall be in sufficient detail to serve as the basis from which to identify and rate the job. The rating of a job shall serve only to assign the job into a proper wage grade for application of the Wage and Salary Schedule. 3.03 The rating of jobs on the basis of job content involves certain basic determinations with respect to the composite of the Skill, Effort and Responsibility normally required in the performance of the work and the Working Conditions under which it is normally performed. In order to accomplish this objective, these factors have been subdivided under the following categories in order to assess the relative worth of each job: SKILL 1. Job Knowledge 2. Human Relations 3. Dexterity JOB RESPONSIBILITY 4. Responsibilities 5. Judgement EFFORT 6. Mental Effort 7. Physical Effort WORKING CONDITIONS 8. Working Conditions 3.04 Job Ratings serve to: (a) group jobs having relatively equivalent point values into the same wage and salary pay grade, and (b) provide the basis from which to establish and maintain equitable wage relationships between jobs, 3.05 In the application of the aforesaid Rating manual (attached hereto as Schedule \"C\"), the following rules shall apply: (a) It is the job that is under consideration and not the individuals who work on the job. (b) The job description and rating of each job in each factor level shall be relative to, consistent with and in conformance with the job description and ratings of all other jobs in the Bargaining Unit.- 115 - ARTICLE IV CREATING AND MAINTAINING JOB DESCRIPTIONS AND RATINGS Job Evaluation Representatives 4.01 The City and the Union shall designate in writing to each other, their representatives for handling all matters relating to job descriptions and ratings in accordance with the terms of this Manual.

A failure to notify within the aforesaid time limits shall be deemed to constitute a rejection of the recommendation. Where the Union and the City each accept the recommendation, the job shall be deemed to have been installed on the day of the mediator's recommendation and the job shall be re-assigned to the appropriate Wage Grade in accordance with Article 6, with such assignment becoming effective from the aforesaid date of installation. (7) The mediator shall issue a written certification to the parties that mediation has been held and completed and specifying the date agreement on all outstanding issues was reached at mediation, if such is the case.

A permanent accommodation is any accommodation where there is no reasonable expectation, medically supported, that the employee's disability will diminish within a reasonable period of time to the extent that the employee will be capable of resuming work with or without accommodation within the employee's own position. 9. When a Local 416 member is temporarily accommodated in the Local 79 Full- Time Bargaining Unit the employee shall be covered by paragraphs 11. or 12. below. However, notwithstanding anything contained in this Carriage of Seniority Memorandum, a disabled employee covered by the Local 416 Collective Agreement and accommodated temporarily in the Local 79 Full-Time Bargaining Unit shall, for hours worked, receive 100% of his/her regular earnings or the rate of the position whichever is greater for the duration of the temporary accommodation and subject to regular reviews, or for hours not worked: use available sick credits and entitlements in accordance with the Collective Agreement, or receive insurance coverage through WSIB, LTD or a private carrier subject to their regulations and the employee shall continue to be covered by the following provisions of the Local 416 Collective Agreement: Article 13 (Vacation Savings Pay and Vacation With Pay) Clause 14.15 and Schedules 3 and 4 (STD Plans) Article 17 (Pensions and Retirement) Article 46 (Modified Work Program) 10.

Notwithstanding paragraph 3., when a disabled employee covered by the Local 416 Collective Agreement is temporarily accommodated in the Local 79 Full-Time Bargaining Unit, the disabled employee's dues shall continue to be remitted to Local 416 for the entire duration of the temporary accommodation in Local 79.

ARTICLE 12 EXTENDED HEALTHCARE/DENTAL/GROUPLIFE AND LTD Private Duty Nursing This will confirm the City of Toronto's administration of Private Duty Nursing claims for members of CUPE Local 79. All private duty nursing claims established after the implementation of the new benefits carrier (August 1st and November 1st) are subject to the terms of the Local 79 Collective Agreement. In reference to private duty nursing claims it states \"Private duty nursing at home when medically necessary, to a maximum of $25,000 per person per three (3) benefit years.\" All existing ongoing private duty nursing claims (established prior to the date of the new benefit carrier) are not subject to the above limitations. These claims are being adjudicated according to past contracts and practices. It is not our intent to apply a limitation to an existing claim that has been established and ongoing prior to the new Local 79 Collective Agreement. However, if the existing claim ends, any new claims for private duty nursing coverage will be subject to the terms of the Local 79 Collective Agreement. BULLETIN BOARDS Dedicated space on bulletin boards will be made available to the Union for the posting of official Union notices in convenient locations determined by the City and the Union. Such bulletin boards shall be in areas where employees will have access to them. The Union shall have the right to post notices of meetings and such other notices as may be of interest to its members. Problems may be identified by either party and shall be the subject of discussion.- P1 - CITY OF TORONTO POLICIES The attached City of Toronto policies were in place at the time the City and Local 79 agreed to append them to the Memorandum of Agreement. For the most up-to-date version of these and other City of Toronto policies, please log on to the City of Toronto intranet website.- P2 - Human Resources Policies Earned Deferred Leave Category: Absence From Work Policy StatementThis policy allows employees who wish to take an extended period of leave for personal reasons, to plan and self-finance that leave of absence. Application All employees listed below who have completed their probationary period are eligible for Earned Deferred Leave. Non-union full-time permanent employees CUPE local 79 full-time permanent employees in the Full Time Unit CUPE local 416 permanent employees TPFF Local 3888 permanent employees (with specific limitations) as provided in the Earned Deferred Leave - Letter of Intent attached to the collective agreement. Definitions Earned Deferred Leave : an authorized leave for six months or one year, in which an employee receives reduced pay during the enrolment period and receives the accrued deductions and interest during the leave period. The leave period must commence within 6 years from entering into the program. Conditions Leave Options Employees may apply for any of the following earned deferred leave options: 90% Option: 4.5 years of work at 90% pay and 6 months of leave 80% Option: 4 years of work at 80% pay and 1 year of leave or 2 years of work at 80% pay and 6 months of leave 75% Option: 3 years of work at 75% pay and 1 year of leave or 1.5 years of work at 75% pay and 6 months of leave Under each of these options, an employee receives the specified percentage of their salary for the period worked and receives the banked percentage plus accrued interest during the leave period, paid out in equal pay period installments. The accrued interest is taxable on an annual basis during the enrolment period and will be reported on an employee's T4 form. Enrolment An employee may apply for enrolment in the plan at any time of the year. An employee must obtain approval to enrol in the plan, from his/her executive director/general manager/division head or designate.- P3 - The executive director/general manager/division head or designate may: approve the request for immediate enrolment approve the request but defer enrolment for a year deny the request. The executive director/general/division head manager or designate must send written approval, deferral or denial of the request to the applicant. If the request is deferred he/she should indicate when the employee's request can be granted. If the request is denied he/ she must explain the reasons to the employee. The executive director/general manager/division head or designate should evaluate applications on the basis of consistent criteria to ensure employees are treated in a fair and equitable manner. In a situation where a number of employees within the same division or section apply for leave at the same time the executive director/general manager/division head or designate may need more information to prioritize requests. Guidelines for Assessing Competing Requests are included in this policy under the Implementation Section. The division will most often receive notice three or four years in advance of a leave; this will provide substantial opportunity for planning. The terms of the enrolment in the plan are documented in an Earned Deferred Leave Contract signed by both parties, when a leave is approved. This can be changed in one of the following ways: The terms of the contract are changed by mutual consent. An executive director/general manager/division head may require an employee to withdraw from the plan if the employee transfers or is promoted to a different division that did not authorize the leave and that division cannot accommodate the employee's absence because of operational requirements. An employee, who wishes to withdraw from the plan during the enrolment period, may do so in exceptional circumstances only e.g. financial hardship. If the employee withdraws from the plan he/she receives one lump sum payment for deferred salary and accrued interest, which becomes fully taxable in the year of receipt. An employee must take an Earned Deferred Leave all at once i.e. the leave cannot be split up. Employees on Earned Deferred Leave may not work in any city division in either a full-time or part-time capacity during the period of leave. The Earned Deferred Leave program and Earned Deferred Leave Contract are governed by and administered in accordance with Section 248(1) of the Income Tax Act and Regulation 6801. An employee is not allowed to enter into more than one Earned Deferred Leave Contract at a time.- P4 - While an employee is on leave a position may be filled with acting or temporary staff, or left vacant. Return from leave An employee returning from Earned Deferred Leave will return to his/her former position if available, or a suitable alternate position. In accordance with regulation 6801 of the Income Tax Act, employees are required to return to their employment after the leave for a period that is not less than the leave of absence. Implementation Guidelines for Assessing Competing Requests for Earned Deferred Leaves Requests will be received a year or more in advance of the leave, providing substantial opportunity to prepare for the period of absence. On some occasions, two or more employees may request leaves at the same time. If it is not possible to accommodate all those applicants, an attempt should be made to negotiate some satisfactory alternative schedule with the parties involved. If no satisfactory resolution can be obtained, the following criteria can be taken into account when making the decision. Priority should be given to employees requesting a leave under the following circumstances: an employee plans to use the leave as a means of easing the transition to full retirement, subject to conditions stated above a leave is being requested on \"compassionate\" grounds, for example to provide care to an ill family member an employee has been appointed to a leadership position with a professional or volunteer organization, and requires a leave in order to take the position a leave has been requested for a specific time-dated activity that cannot easily be postponed (e.g. attendance at a course of studies). The executive director/general manager/division head or designate may also wish to take the following factors into account when determining priority among competing requests: a leave date has been requested to co-ordinate with that of other family members. a leave date has been requested to provide for a specifically seasonal activity. If it is not possible to resolve the conflict given these factors, it is recommended that an objective criterion such as seniority or date of application be used to determine priority.- P5 - Starting the Leave Employees should begin their leaves as soon as the deferral period is over. In exceptional circumstances, employees may defer their leaves, however, income tax regulations require that the leave of absence must begin no later than six years after the start of the deferral period. For example, if the deferral begins on June 1 2001, the leave of absence must start no later than June 1, 2007. Illness during Leave If an employee becomes seriously ill during the leave, and wishes to defer part of the leave, the employee should contact his/her executive director/general manager/division head or designate. These situations will be dealt with on a case by case basis. Adjustments will be made in cases where the illness is of such severity and duration so as to effectively frustrate the purpose of the leave, and are within the latitude allowed by Revenue Canada regulations. Salary & BenefitsSalary During the enrolment period, an employee receives and is taxed upon the elected percentage of his/her current salary. While on leave the employee receives and is taxed upon the deferred amount plus accrued interest paid out. During the enrolment period, interest credited on deferred amounts is reported for tax purposes each December 31. Performance Pay - non union employees There are two kinds of pay increase: Across the Board Increase (ABI) A pay increase based primarily on cost of living allowance, subject to Council's approval. The ABI is applied as an across-the-board increase to the salary ranges and the employee's salary, provided the employee received a performance level of \"met objectives\" or \"developmental\". Performance Pay A pay increase that is determined by the employee's performance level, i.e. 1% (developmental) or 3% (met objectives). This increase is added to the employee's current salary up to the maximum salary of the range. The employee receives no ABI or performance pay increase while on earned deferred leave. When the employee returns, he/ she receives a prorated performance pay increase for the time worked prior to his/her earned deferred leave. Payroll adjusts the employee's pay to reflect any missed ABI increase(s), effective on the employee's return date.- P6 - Example The employee and manager set objectives on January 1, 2005 . The employee starts an earned deferred leave on April 1, 2005 and returns on April 1, 2006 . A closing review meeting is held with the manager before the employee begins the leave. The performance pay increase, based on performance is prorated for three (3) months ( January 1 to March 31, 2005 ) The prorated performance pay and full ABI are applied to the employee's base salary upon the employee's return from his/her earned deferred leave. The manager completes the Pay for Performance Form and sends it to Payroll for processing upon the employee's return. The employee returns from leave on April 1, 2006 , and sets objectives with the manager for nine months ( April to December ). A review is held in the first quarter of 2007 and any performance pay increase is prorated for nine (9) months. The full ABI is applied from January 1, 2007. Benefits The employee receives his/her usual benefits during the enrolment period of the plan and the leave period. Most employee benefits are not related to level of income. There are some exceptions: Group Life Insurance Long Term Disability Pensions Contributions and premiums for these programs during the enrolment period will be based upon full (100%) salary. During the leave period benefits related to salary shall be at the salary level (100%) at the time the leave started. During the leave period an employee may elect to maintain any optional life insurance coverage that he/she has and pay the appropriate premiums. If the employee declines to maintain this coverage, upon return from the leave it may be necessary to provide proof of insurability to re-instate optional coverage. Pension Under the OMERS Plan, the leave period is considered broken service. When the employee returns from leave if he/she wishes to buy back pension service he/she must pay both the employee and the employer's contribution to the pension plan, for the period of the leave. If the employee elects to purchase this period of broken service, the city will make a one-time lump sum payment equal to the employer's contribution to the employee. This lump sum is a taxable benefit. The Income Tax Act restricts the number of broken service periods for which an employee can purchase pension credit to a lifetime maximum of 5 years plus up to an additional 2 years for periods of parental leave.- P7 - Vacation Employees do not earn vacation while on leave. Any vacation that is owing to employees when they begin the leave will be available to them when they return from leave. The period of the leave counts towards service requirements for calculating increases in vacation entitlements. For example: On January 1st 2002 an employee begins his 7th year of employment and has 15 days entitlement in his vacation bank when he goes on leave on January 1st 2002. He takes 6 months leave. He still has 15 days entitlement when he returns to work on July 2nd 2002. However, in 2002 he works for 6 months only and therefore earns 7.5 days of vacation, which is made available to him on January 1st 2003. On January 1st 2004, in the employee's 9th year he is entitled to 20 days of vacation. Canada Pension and Employment Insurance Employment Insurance premiums are deducted during the enrolment period on the full salary. During the leave an employee does not contribute to employment insurance and the leave period is not counted as insurable employment. If this is of concern to an employee he/she should check the implications of his/her particular situation by contacting the local Employment Insurance Commission office. Canada Pension Plan deductions are calculated on the reduced salary during the enrolment period and during the leave CPP is calculated on the deferred amount. Sick pay No sick pay is accrued during the leave. Any sick credits owing to employees when they begin the leave will be available to them when they return from leave. Approved by Workforce Strategy Team for the Executive Management Team. Date Approved April 12, 2001 Revised December 5, 2006- P8 - Human Resources Policies Family Medical Leave Category: Absence From Work Policy StatementThe City of Toronto provides up to eight weeks unpaid Family Medical Leave to employees who need to take a leave to provide care and support to a family member who has a serious medical condition where there is a significant risk of death occurring within a period of 26 weeks. Application This policy applies to all City of Toronto employees and shall be administered in accordance with the Employment Standards Act. Definitions For the purpose of this policy, family member is defined as: 1. The employee's spouse ( includes common law and same sex partner) 2. A parent, step-parent or foster parent of the employee 3. A child, step-child or foster child of the employee or the employee's spouse. 4. A brother or sister of the employee. 5. A grandparent of the employee or of the employee's spouse. 6. A grandchild of the employee or of the employee's spouse. 7. The father-in-law or mother-in-law of the employee. 8. A brother-in-law or sister-in-law of the employee. 9. A son-in-law or daughter-in-law of the employee or of the employee's spouse. 10. An uncle or aunt of the employee or of the employee's spouse. 11. The nephew or niece of the employee or of the employee's spouse. 12. The spouse of the employee's grandchild, uncle, aunt, nephew or niece. 13. A foster parent of the employee's spouse. 14. A person who considers the employee to be like a family member. Note: In numbers 4 to 8 a reference to a relationship includes the corresponding \"step\" relationship. Provide care and support : providing psychological or emotional support, arranging for care by a third party provider or directly providing or participating in the care of the family member.- P9 - Conditions Requirement for medical certificate An employee is entitled to a leave of absence without pay of up to eight weeks to provide care or support to a family member, if a qualified health practitioner issues a certificate stating that the individual has a serious medical condition with a significant risk of death occurring within a period of 26 weeks or a shorter period. Duration of leave When the health practitioner issues a certificate, an employee may take the Family Medical Leave within the 26-week period specified in the medical certificate. For example an employee may begin the leave as soon as the certificate is issued or may choose to wait to start the leave, as long as the leave does not extend beyond the designated end of the 26-week period. The employee may remain on a leave for eight weeks or the last day of the week in which the family member dies. The eight (8) weeks of a Family Medical Leave do not have to be taken consecutively but an employee may only take a leave in periods of entire weeks. \"Week\" is defined for Family Medical Leave purposes as a period of seven consecutive days beginning on a Sunday and ending on a Saturday. Week is defined in this way to correspond with the beginning and end of the week set for Employment Insurance (EI) entitlement purposes. Sharing the leave If two or more employees (employed by the same or different organisations) take this leave to provide care and support for a specific family member, the eight weeks of Family Medical Leave must be shared between them. For example if one spouse takes six weeks to care for his or her child, the other spouse would be able to take only two weeks of Family Medical Leave. Extension of leave If employees request an extension beyond the eight weeks leave, they must submit a written request to their supervisor. The supervisor decides if this extension can be granted. If the request is approved, the extended leave can be covered by vacation, Voluntary Leave, Leave without Pay as well as personal leave provisions contained in the applicable collective agreements. Subsequent leaves If an employee takes a leave and the family member does not die within 26 weeks, the employee may take another leave at a later time and requires another medical certificate for that purpose. Employment Insurance Benefits All employees covered under the Employment Standards Act are entitled to take a Family Medical Leave. Those employees who qualify can also access Compassionate Care Employment Insurance (EI) benefits for up to six weeks. In order to access these benefits, employees must serve a two- week unpaid waiting period.- P10 - Employees entitled to EI benefits can apply for employment insurance. Employees are required to provide a medical certificate to Employment Insurance in order to receive the benefit. The medical certificate can be found on the EI website. Employment Insurance permits the sharing of the six-week benefit by two or more working members of the family. If the benefit is shared, only one employee serves the waiting period. Employees may take the eight-week leave all at once or divide it into parts with a minimum of one-week segments. Note: For details on eligibility on employment insurance benefits refer to the Employment Insurance (EI) Compassionate Care Benefits website (see link below) Examples Jane takes leave from Sunday August 8th to October 2nd and returns to work on October 4th, having completed the eight-week leave with six weeks EI benefit. Abdul takes leave from August 8th to September 4th and returns to work on September 6th. (Four weeks: two-week waiting period and two-week leave with benefit). Abdul takes further leave from September 19th to October 2nd and returns to work October 4th (two-week leave with benefit). Abdul takes further leave from November 14th to November 27th and returns to work on November 29th (two-week leave with benefit). Julia takes leave from October 10th to October 30th and returns to work on November 1st. She takes three weeks leave with benefit. Her brother had previously taken leave with three weeks benefit and had served the waiting period. The EI benefits can be paid regardless of where the family member lives. If employees are required to travel to other countries to look after a dying family member, they are still entitled to the benefit and can access the benefit by application through the Internet. The EI benefit ends at the end of the week in which the person dies if this occurs during the benefit period. Salary & Benefits Benefits Basic benefits coverage (health, dental, group life insurance, STD and LTD) continues during Family Medical Leave. Benefit coverage for part-time employees continues to be on a pro-rated basis. Employees are responsible for premiums that they would normally pay for benefits that are not covered by the basic plan, for example additional coverage for group life insurance. Pension If employees want to maintain pension service credits they must pay their pension contributions for the duration of the leave. The city will match these contributions.- P11 - Vacation Employees' annual vacation entitlement is not affected by this leave. Sick Pay Employees, who accumulate sick leave credits, continue to earn sick credits during the period of leave. Service and Seniority Employees accumulate full service and seniority during the leave. However, Family Medical Leave days are not counted towards the completion of the probationary period. Increments and Pay for Performance Bargaining unit employees' increments are not affected by this leave. Non-union employees receive the full merit level increase based on their performance for the duration of the Family Medical Leave. Any further leave without pay is subject to pro-ration of the merit level increase and market rate adjustment. Implementation Notifying supervisors Employees who wish to take Family Medical Leave must advise their managers/supervisors before taking the leave. If prior notice is not possible because of the urgency of the situation, employees should inform their managers/supervisors as soon as possible. Employees must submit their requests in writing, stating: the date that they want to start their leave and the date when they expect to return to work the amount of leave requested and the scheduling e.g. eight weeks together; four weeks taken in weekly segments whether the employee is the only family member taking the leave and if sharing the leave with another family member how many weeks he/she is taking i.e. less than eight (8) weeks. If employees are not sure when they will be returning to work, they should contact their supervisors at a later date to advise of their return to work. If there is a change in the return to work date, supervisors must e-mail the new return to work date to Payroll as soon as they receive the information from employees. Information for Payroll Supervisors must ensure that a Leave of Absence Request/ Notification form is completed stating \"Family Medical Leave\" in the Comments section, Section B, and submit the form to Payroll. The payroll control clerk sends a Record of Employment form directly to the employee. At the start of the leave, the Pensions, Payroll & Employee Benefits Division sends a letter to the employee to explain that benefits will be protected on condition that proof is submitted that the requested leave is a Family Medical Leave. - P12 - Employees who are collecting EI benefits must submit confirmation that their leaves have been approved by Employment Insurance by sending the original EI pay stubs to Payroll as soon as they receive them and continue to provide the pay stubs as they are received. Supervisors may ask an employee for a copy of the certificate as appropriate, for instance, in the situation where employees are not entitled to EI benefits because they do not have sufficient insurable hours. These employees must provide a certificate to their supervisor, from a qualified health practitioner stating that the employee's family member has a serious medical condition with a significant risk of death occurring within a period of 26 weeks or a shorter period. This certificate should be attached to the form submitted to Payroll. The certificate can either be a copy of the certificate used for EI purposed (available from the EI website) or a note from the health practitioner with the relevant information. The federal government has developed a \"Compassionate Care Benefits Attestation\" form that is required for those persons applying for the Employment Insurance Compassionate Care Benefit under the \"like a family member\" category. The form needs to be signed by the gravely ill person or his or her legal representative, confirming that the caregiver is \"like a family member\". In situations where the employee is applying for Family Medical Leave to care for a person who considers the employee to be like a family member, supervisors can request this document from an employee to confirm the employee's eligibility, regardless of whether the employee is applying for the Employment Insurance Compassionate Care Benefit. Approved by Executive Management Team Date Approved November 8, 2004 Revised December 6, 2006- P13 - Human Resources Policies Leave without Pay Category: Absence From Work Policy StatementThis policy allows employees who wish to take an extended period of leave for personal reasons to do so. Application All employees listed below are eligible for Leave without pay. Non-union full-time permanent employees who have completed their probationary period CUPE local 79 employees CUPE local 416 employees Definitions Leave without Pay: an authorized leave for up to a year without pay or benefits. Conditions Employees may apply for a leave period of up to one year. An employee must give notice of leave to his/her executive director/ division head to give the division time to plan for the employee's extended absence. The minimum advance notice should be one month. Employees may apply for a leave without pay at any time of the year. The leave of absence must be approved by an employee's executive director/general manager/division head or designate. When he/she receives a request, he/she may: approve the request approve the request but defer the leave deny the request. The executive director/general manager/division head or designate must send written approval, deferral or denial of the request to the applicant. If the request is deferred or denied he/ she must explain the reasons to the employee and indicate whether the employee's request can be granted at some future date. The executive director/general manager/division head or designate should evaluate applications on the basis of consistent criteria to ensure employees are treated in a fair and equitable manner. In a situation where a number of employees within the same division or section apply for leave at the same time the executive director/general manager/division head or designate may need more information to prioritize requests. Guidelines for Assessing Competing Requests are included in this policy under the Implementation section.- P14 - The terms of the plan leave are documented and agreed to by both parties, when a leave is approved. This can be changed only by mutual consent. Return from leave An employee returning from leave without pay will return to his/her former position or a suitable alternate position if available. While an employee is on leave a position may be filled with acting or temporary staff, or left vacant. Implementation Guidelines for Assessing Competing Requests for Leaves On some occasions, two or more employees may request leaves at the same time. If it is not possible to accommodate all applicants, an attempt should be made to negotiate some satisfactory alternative schedule with the parties involved. If no satisfactory resolution can be obtained, the following criteria may be taken into account when making the decision. Priority should be given to employees requesting a leave under the following circumstances: an employee plans to use the leave as a means of easing the transition to full retirement a leave is being requested on \"compassionate\" grounds, for example to provide care to an ill family member an employee has been appointed to a leadership position with a professional or volunteer organization, and requires a leave in order to take the position a leave has been requested for a specific time-dated activity that cannot easily be postponed (e.g. attendance at a course of studies). The executive director/general manager/division head or designate may also wish to take the following factors into account when determining priority among competing requests: a leave date has been requested to co-ordinate with that of other family members a leave date has been requested to provide for a specifically seasonal activity. If it is not possible to resolve the situation given these factors, it is recommended that an objective criterion such as date of application be used to determine priority. Salary & Benefits Benefits This is a leave without pay and at no cost to the city. An employee has the option of discontinuing benefits or maintaining all benefits coverage at his/her own expense. An election form must be completed prior to the commencement of the leave and the employee must pay the benefit premiums before the leave begins.- P15 - OMERS Pension A leave without pay is a break in service. If an employee wants to maintain pension service credits he/she must pay both the employee's and city's pension contributions for the duration of the leave. An election form will be forwarded to the employee following the completion of the leave. Vacation Vacation is reduced for the period of the leave taken, on a pro- rated basis. For example, if an employee is on leave for six months he/she does not earn any vacation during the period on leave but earns vacation for the balance of that year. The period of leave is not counted towards service requirements for calculating increases in vacation entitlements. Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance On a leave without pay an employee does not contribute to the Canada Pension Plan or employment insurance and the leave period is not counted as insurable employment. If this is of concern to an employee he/she should check the implications of his/her particular situation by contacting his/her local Employment Insurance Commission office. Sick pay No sick pay is accrued during the leave. Approved by Workforce Strategy Team for the Executive Management Team.
