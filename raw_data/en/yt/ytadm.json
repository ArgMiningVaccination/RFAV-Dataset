While some are mild, others are irritating or frightening and even lethal. Unfortunately, the Joe Biden administration is paying little attention to the side effects, repercussions and [harm these vaccines bring](http://vaccineinjurynews.com) to innocent children. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has repeatedly denied the dangers brought about by these vaccines, the facts the federal agency uncovered proved otherwise. The children weren't spared from the side effects of these vaccines granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to the data released Sept. 1, the most common systemic reactions were \" [fatigue, fever and irritability](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/babies-toddlers-systemic-reaction-covid-vaccine-cdc-et/).\" (Related: [Spike proteins in Pfizer, Moderna Covid-19 vaccines linked to deadly blood clots, brain inflammation and heart attacks](https://naturalnews.com/2021-04-16-spike-proteins-pfizer-moderna-vaccines-clots-inflammation.html).) The data were collected through a program called V-Safe - a smartphone-based monitoring system that operates through a downloadable app, which uses text messaging and web surveys to provide health check-ins after getting COVID-19 vaccination. After thorough scrutiny of the information relayed by parents through V-Safe, the CDC found that 55 percent of 8,338 children aged six months to two years who received the Moderna vaccine experienced systemic reaction after the first dose and 58 percent after the second dose. For the Pfizer vaccine, parents of 4,749 children in the same age range submitted reports showing that 55.8 percent had a systemic reaction after the first dose. Surprisingly, the percentage of those who felt reactions fell to 47 percent after the second dose of the vaccine. Other than the information culled from V-Safe, reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) and the Vaccine Safety Data Link (VSD) were also analyzed. Done earlier, these are ideal moves. But the thing is, all three systems look at the safety of vaccines after they've already gone to market and have been administered to large numbers of people. Now, these health collaborators even dare to put the children's health on the line, just for big profits that run into billions. This year alone, Pfizer and Moderna are projected to earn a combined $93.2 billion, with Pfizer getting $54.5 billion and Moderna 38.7 billion. As expected, the [CDC tried to shield itself](http://cdc.news) from criticisms hurled during the data presentation. Tom Shimabukuro, the head of the CDC's vaccine safety team, told committee members that no \"statistical signals\" of COVID-19 vaccine reactions were found for young children in the VSD data. Downplaying the systemic reactions, Shimabukuro said such occurrences were \"commonly reported\" following vaccinations. Other medical professionals, including Dr. Meryl Nass of Children's Health Defense, were not convinced by Shimabukuro's claims. They expressed caution over the high number of reported reactions among very young children. On Sept. 2, Nass told the Epoch Times that the government should collect and present more information on these cases, which are of paramount importance as they involved the future generation. According to the CDC, 599,460 children have received the Pfizer vaccine and about 440,770 have received the Moderna vaccine. The CDC also assuaged the parents' fears that the reactions could lead to serious injuries. It claimed that more than 98 percent of reports are considered normal in nature and do not require hospitalization or prolonged treatment. However, there are VAERS reports that could sow fear among parents. Following a COVID-vaccine injection, at least 220 children aged five months to five years were taken to the emergency room. A two-year-old boy in Arizona even had a life-threatening episode after receiving the Pfizer vaccine. After vomiting and having difficulty breathing, the boy \"turned blue,\" got \"limp,\" was \"non-responsive\" and \"fully stopped breathing for two minutes.\" Fortunately, he was revived and survived. Another CDC report stated that 3,150 people were \"unable to work or perform normal daily activities\" after being given the COVID-19 vaccine. No wonder even medical practitioners are divided on the issue of giving the vaccine to young children. Some doctors swear the vaccines are safe and effective in preventing serious illnesses, while some doctors remain skeptical - especially with the adverse reaction data that Big Pharma and the government health agencies were discovered trying to hide from the public. The bottom line is innocent children should be spared these injections. After all, several studies have shown they are naturally well-protected from viruses.
