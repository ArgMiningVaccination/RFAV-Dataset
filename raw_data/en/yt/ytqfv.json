More than half of 503 children surveyed at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital reported using complementary and alternative remedies in the previous 12 months, the researchers reported in the Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health. But in 63 per cent of those cases, paediatrician Alissa Lim and colleagues found parents had not informed the child's treating doctor. \"Most commonly, families do not tell their doctors about complementary and alternative medicine use and doctors do not ask,\" they wrote. \"Given the potential risk of adverse events associated with the use of complementary and alternative medicine or interactions with conventional management, doctors should ask about their use as a part of routine history-taking.\" The most likely reasons children surveyed used complementary therapies was for promotion of general health and treatment of colds. Other reasons included as a dietary supplement, skin conditions, gastrointestinal ailments, relaxation and sleep. Common alternative medicines taken were vitamin and mineral supplements, herbal remedies and homeopathic treatments, the researchers said. Use of such medicines were more likely to have been initiated by the children's parents rather than a medical practitioner. \"The high rate of parent-initiated complementary and alternative medicine use for general health or common childhood illnesses suggests that families are seeking alternative ways to boost or maintain the highest possible level of health for their child,\" the authors wrote. \"This highlights the fact that any child may be using complementary and alternative medicine and not just those who traditionally have been considered to be high users, for example those with serious or chronic illness.\" The researchers found medicinal use was higher in children aged over two years and those with private health insurance. Children in the survey ranged in age from young babies to 19 years. They were selected from those admitted to hospital following presentation to the emergency department and children attending outpatient clinic appointments over a five-month period. The results were consistent with a 1998 study of children with asthma attending hospital in South Australia which found 55 per cent used alternative remedies. The Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health is a journal of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians which represents 9,000 specialists in Australia and New Zealand. "}
