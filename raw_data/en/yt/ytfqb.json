Editor, Advancing Medicine with Food and Nutrients \"As a colleague of Dr. Charles Moss in integrative medicine since the 1970s, I can attest to his pioneering work in nutritional medicine, and to his wide-ranging knowledge and contemporary application of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), the world's oldest mind-body medicine model. In this book he blends the wisdom of the latter with his thirty-five years of practical clinical experience with cutting-edge nutritional medicine. The result is a book that helps the reader deal with modern health risks with clear and practical suggestions and with the wider understanding of how our diet itself directly affects our stress levels. Both TCM and modern Western medicine would agree that our overall ability to handle stress is a foundational skill for vital living and the single most important preventive principle for all modern diseases.\" Ronald Puhky, MD, BAc Dip Ac.
