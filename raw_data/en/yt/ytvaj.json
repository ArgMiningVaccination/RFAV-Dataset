Watch out for the many scams out there advertising foods, supplements and other products claiming to instantly boost your immune system to fight off COVID-19. If it sounds too good to be true, it is and can be health damaging. Here are some sure-fire ways to boost your immune system! Eat smart While there is no convincing evidence that a particular food or diet can boost your immune response, there are multiple nutrients that DO play a role in supporting a healthy immune system. These include vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and E as well as folic acid, iron, selenium and zinc. The best way to meet those needs is through foods, by consuming a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. Fresh or frozen, the nutrients are the same. Take a look at some key nutrient to support immune function, and where to find them in foods: -Vitamin A: yellow/orange foods (carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, and oranges) -Vitamin C: strawberries, citrus fruits -Vitamin D: fatty fish (salmon, and fortified dairy products -Vitamin E: almonds, avocado, broccoli, spinach -Iron: lean beef, poultry, fish; tofu, beans spinach -Zinc - lean meat and shellfish, chickpeas [RELATED: 5 sure-fire ways to avoid stress eating during this uncertain time](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nbcnews.com/know-your-value/feature/5-sure-fire-ways-avoid-stress-eating-during-uncertain-time-ncna1170356__;!!HXCxUKc!jNuc6QR0m4GnZsfTCCYAcvNwOyAv7fi3YsHA-Hfw5wAYNp75a8sZ_ZxC4IDPlac$) Remember that supplements only support - but do not replace - what you're eating. If you don't have a lot of variety in your diet, you might consider a daily multivitamin-mineral supplement, with 100 percent of the daily requirements. But when it comes to supplements, more doesn't mean better; too much of certain nutrients (like Vitamin D or zinc) can make you sick. And while it's natural - and tempting - to throw healthy eating out the window at times of stress, make a commitment to your own health by focusing on healthy eating, with regularly scheduled treats.

But restorative sleep can be more challenging during stressful times. It's most important to schedule a regular bedtime and wake-up time. While it might be skewed a little later or earlier than usual, aim for seven to eight hours of sleep. And your eating and activity patterns matter when it comes to sleep. Regular exercise can help (allowing at least three hours between exercise and bedtime) as well as cutting out caffeine after 3 p.m. (noon if you are caffeine sensitive). Your sleep environment, can make a big difference too. Be sure to: -Keep your room cool and dark (or use eye shades) -Keep it quiet (or use white noise) -Avoid TV, video, or phone use at least an hour before bedtime. Keep moving Physical activity of all kinds support your immune system. With the gyms closed, and most of us mainly homebound, there are still many ways to be physically active, whether you're a beginner or already committed. Remember: -Daily activity at home goes a long way towards keeping you fit. Household chores - like cleaning, vacuuming, disinfecting, and laundry -all keep you moving.

Create your own routine, or go on-line and look for your favorites. Some national chains and many smaller gyms are offering personalized classes to members. Change your response to stress While you can't change the stress of coronavirus, you can change your response. Stress is a physical hardship on the body, with the release of stress hormones. By adjusting your response, you can block this cascade, and support a healthier immune system. When stress starts to creep up (and it will come and go), pick an activity that helps distract and relax you, so the physical response never comes. Here are some idea to get you started: [RELATED: Celebrity trainer Anna Kaiser: 5 ways to stay active during this unprecedented time](https://www.nbcnews.com/know-your-value/feature/celebrity-trainer-anna-kaiser-5-ways-stay-active-during-unprecedented-ncna1172296) -Take a break, and go for a walk, call a friend, clean out a closet, or practice deep breathing.
