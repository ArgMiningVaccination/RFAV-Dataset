Many of these remedies have been around since 1500 B.C. In Columbia, practitioners are using alternative healing to bring balance to our 21st century community. Movement of energy Reiki is a Japanese therapy that involves working with someone's lifeforce energy. \"It's just shifting energy,\" says Angie Butts, owner and holistic energy practitioner of [Triple Flame Healing](https://tripleflamehealing.com/about/). \"It's moving that energy, getting it out of your system, so you can be balanced and in alignment with your higher self.\" Butts struggled with conventional healing methods after a 2007 car accident. She had two spinal surgeries, tried physical therapy and used steroid injections and opioids, but nothing worked. Butts began her reiki journey in 2016 after spending hours one day at a metaphysical supply store, Heart, Body and Soul. She found resources that helped her understand herself better and led her to opening her own practice. Butts focuses on reiki, healing touch, quantum resonance and anything intuitive. She finds areas of the body that have trapped, stagnant energy and coaxes that energy out. Butt says this energy can affect people's emotions, abilities and physical body. \"Reiki knows where to go, what to do,\" says Amy Dove, who offers sound healing and reiki at [Heart, Body and Soul.](https://heartbodyandsoul.org/classes-events/reiki-sessions-with-amy-dove/) Dove and Butts align their clients' chakras at the beginning of sessions. Dove uses singing bowls, tuning forks and chimes to help her sense whether the person's chakras are balanced. There are seven main chakras along the spine. Chakra, meaning \"disk\" or \"wheel\" in Sanskrit, is an energy center in your body. Originating in India in 1500-500 B.C., the system has been passed down by Indo-Europeans through oral tradition. Get to the point Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine in which very thin needles are strategically placed into the body. Mary Cruise, acupuncturist at [Mary Cruise Healing Arts](https://marycruisehealingarts.com/), uses this method to restore \"qi\" or vital energy, balance the body's energy, stimulate healing and promote relaxation. Her website states acupuncture can help conditions including arthritis, insomnia, stress and chronic pain. More than martial arts Qigong is a coordinated movement of breathing and meditation to increase health and spirituality along with a type of martial arts training. It \"takes time, dedication and perseverance to gain an in-depth understanding of how energy flows in the body,\" [Cruise's website states](https://marycruisehealingarts.com/?p=87). Qigong techniques teach people to control the distribution of one's qi to improve mood, flexibility, concentration, stress management and lower blood pressure, according to Cruise's website. Finding peace of mind People who struggle with their relationship with their bodies tend to feel disconnected from them, says [Lynn Rossy](https://www.lynnrossy.com/), a health psychologist. Rossy, who's also a yoga teacher at [alleyCat](https://alleycatyoga.com/), says teaching people to embrace themselves in a kind, compassionate way is extremely healing. She teaches Kripalu yoga, which helps target stress, pain, depression and eating behaviors. Meditation is a method for practicing mindfulness and achieving a stable state of mind. Meditation and yoga can open the door to other healing practice, as most of these practitioners began with some form of meditation and yoga. "}
