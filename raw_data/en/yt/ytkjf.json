In July 2014, the family nally joined me, once my son's A Levels were over - we have been living a somewhat complicated life between here and London, not unknown among Heads of Houses! And we look forward to settling fully into the Lodge and opening its doorsmore regularly to all our members - thoughwe have an almost superhuman standard of generosity and warmth to live up to in our predecessors in the Lodge. It has been wonderful to enter into the inheritance of Duncan and Lisa, and to have such a spectacular example of how to do this job well. One or two kind friends have enquired whether the job of cat-herding that is undoubtedly an aspect of being a Head of House is harder or easier than it was in Another Job I have done: I can truthfully say that there is no comparison, and that my new colleagues' willingness to pull together and support each other is some- thing from which some other institutions might learn. But welcome is the word for so many College-related events in more far-flung locations too. The lot of a Master these days includes a good deal of fund-raising for the College in the Far East or the United States; and what has struck me is the enormous commitment of our alumni to the College family, the sense of still being part of a community they really love and appreciate. It has been a great encourage- ment to see how and why Magdalene matters to so many, and has conrmed my own sense of commitment to the College. Thanks to a stellar team in College, the whole world of Development and alumni relations has continued to grow and flourish; the numbers who have attended events in far-flung locations like Hong Kong or Boston, or Shropshire, tell their own story. And the success of more focused networks like Magdalene in the City and the Law Association promises well for the future, as well as offering welcome opportunities for our current under- graduates to meet alumni and build relations. The percentage of our alumni who Photo: Paul Rogers9are committed donors continues to grow by leaps and bounds; and the impressive success of this year's telephone campaign has shown how important it is to keep relations between current and former students concrete and personal. The last full year in fact saw a record level of donations to the College, in the order of \u00a33,000,000 in total value. The priority of course remains student support; we want to maintain our proud claim that no-one need be deterred from applying here because of nancial stringency; and in fact we offer levels of support that compare very favourably with many wealthier colleges. Financial support for Higher Education has not been a popular policy among our political masters for a good while, and the colleges have to struggle to maintain their distinctive ethos and excellence. Without our alumni, this would be entirely impossible, and it would take all the space I have to record all the support we receive. But among many generous benefactions, I might perhaps mention just a few of particular interest. The ongoing municence of the Cripps family has secured for us a handsome property in Southwold which is already being used for College reading parties and as a retreat for Fellows and staff; and Mark (Lord) Malloch-Brown and Sir Richard Jolly have together funded a major new prize in memory of our great eighteenth century Master, Peter Peckard, who played such a signicant part in the agitation against the slave trade. This prize is offered across the University for an innovative study of some contemporary form of slavery. On top of this, we were delighted to receive from the estate of T S Eliot's widow a collection of translations and rst editions of his works, a number of books from his working library, and his Nobel Gold Medal: a tting reminder of Magdalene's literary heritage and the succession of Honorary Fellows who have brought reflected glory to us. Mention of Honorary Fellows and Nobel Laureates reminds us of two major losses this past year - Seamus Heaney and Nelson Mandela, whose obituaries appear on pp 11-22 and whose deaths were felt by so many across the world with a personal intensity not always in evidence when public gures depart this life. We were immensely proud to have them as part of the Magdalene family, and are determined to honour their memory appropriately. An unforgettable day this last March to celebrate Seamus brought together a hugely distinguished assembly of literary and scholarly gures from Britain and Ireland and further aeld; the presence and active participation of Marie Heaney was a special joy and privilege. And we are now in process of setting up a Magdalene Mandela Foundation which will extend the existing provision of Mandela scholarships to the whole of Africa and also allow the endowment of some more senior positions in African studies in College and University. Heaney and Mandela were among the most powerful witnesses we could have had to the global prole of the College and its commitment to nourishing and celebrating lives that transform the whole of our human environment. This prole and commitment was also signally upheld by Andrew Brown, whose obituary appears on p 23, in his world-wide work for Cambridge University Press. His untimely death was remembered at a huge gathering in Great St Mary's Church in the Lent Term.10We continue to attract a distinguished array of Visiting Fellows from around the world, and are particularly pleased at the number and calibre of candidates for Research Fellowships and Bye-Fellowships. It has been more than usually difcult this year to decide between an assortment of unmistakably brilliant applicants, and we feel we have done very well in the appointments we have made in a variety of elds. Academically, in terms of Tripos performance, last year was not the best in recent history; but, with well over 70% of our nalists achieving a First or 2.1 (with a notably strong showing in Law, where our results were among the best in the University), it is very clear that we are not going to slip back to a position at the lower end of the tables. The plans for a new Library building, which many readers will have been made aware of, signal our commitment to the best provision for our students' academic work; our hope is that a new building will not only create more study space and at last provide a proper home for our archives, but will free the Pepys Building for more diverse use and public access. As I write, we are in the process of deciding on an architect, and there is every chance of our having a building that will sit happily with the understated elegance of the rest of the College, but will also have the flexibility to cope with the fast changing demands of contemporary styles of study. We are not completely persuaded that the book is about to become obsolete, as some claim; but we know that any new provision forstudy must allow for a future of growing diversity. Our intention is to launch a prospectus for this project in a few months' time. Leisure activities have been as vigorous as ever; and it is a pleasure to record the ne performance of the Women's Second Boat last year in the Bumps, an excellent production of 'Joseph and His Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat' in the Cripps Auditorium in the early spring, and an open-air 'Winter's Tale' in the Master's Garden. A successful May Ball in 2013 reinforced the College's reputation as regularly providing both one of the most stylish and one of the most relaxed of the college balls. It has been good to see how much overlap there has been between students (graduate and undergraduate) involved in activities like all of these and those who have distinguished themselves academically; in a properly functioning College, there should not be a sense of either/or about academic quality and social and creative engagement. I am profoundly grateful to all, colleagues and students and College staff, who have helped me to be at home here, as well as to all our alumni who have in various ways given support to the Williams family as they settle in. It is a delight to be here, a delight to get to know Magdalene men and women, past and present, and above all a delight to know that across the generations there continues to be the same generous and demanding vision of what a good college can and should be. It's a vision I am proud to serve as best I can, and I gladly look forward to the help and support of all our members in doing so in the years ahead.

Born 13 April 1939. Educated Anahorish Primary School, St Columb's College, Derry and Queen's University, Belfast. Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize, 1968; E M Forster Award, 1975; PEN Translation Prize, 1985; Whitbread Prizes, 1996 & 1999; Golden Wreath of Poetry, 2001; T S Eliot Prize, 2006, Nobel Prize in Literature, 1995; Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et Lettres, 1996; Lifetime Recognition Award for the Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry, 2012. Professor at Harvard, 1981-1997 and Poet in Residence, 1988-2006. Professor of Poetry at Oxford, 1989-1994. Honorary Fellow 1999. Married Marie Devlin 1965 (two sons, one daughter). Died 30 August 2013, aged 74. 12Seamus Heaney was the most celebrated Irish poet since W B Yeats. Like Yeats, he won the Nobel Prize for literature and, perhaps even more than Yeats, his reputation and influence spread far beyond literary circles, and across the world, making his work a social as well as a literary phenomenon. He was a translator, critic and essayist of distinction, and an absorbing and engaging presence on the platform, whether as speaker or reader. But his poetry was his most remarkable achievement, for its range, its changing forms, consistent quality, and its impact on millions of readers: love poems, elegies, poems about memory and the past, poems about conflict and civil strife, poems about family and the natural world, poems celebrating friendship, poems that found signicance in the everyday, and poems that delighted in the possibilities of the English language, grounded always in the diction of his native County Derry. Heaney's international reputation, nurtured amidst what he called 'the dolorous circumstances of my native place', was sealed when in 1995 he was awarded the Nobel Prize, in the words of the citation'for works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past'. By the end of his life, his books accounted for two-thirds of all sales of poetry in the UK by living poets. He acquired a reputation not only for consummate craftsmanship and integrity of utterance, but for humanity and wisdom. He was a poet who took seri- ously his public role (he called it 'a vocation'), and was prepared to engage with the real world in work that embodied the rare combination of emotional depth, sensuous music, and ready accessibility. Seamus Justin Heaney, the eldest of nine children, was born at Mossbawn near Castledawson, Co. Derry, in a traditional one-storey farmhouse a few miles from the shores of Loch Neagh. His father was a farmer and cattle-dealer, his mother from a family of skilled workers in the local linen mills. Heaney, always alert to symbolic collocations, felt himself heir both to Ireland's ancient Gaelic cattle-breeding traditions, and to the Industrial Revolution which had shaped Ulster's more recent past. Much of his poetry would explore and exploit the tensions between these two aspects of his inheritance. He was educated at St Columb's College, Derry, the Catholic boarding-school whose stellar roster of pupils included the dramatist Brian Friel, the politician John Hume, and the novelist, poet and critic Seamus Deane. In 1957 Heaney went up to Queen's University, Belfast, to study English literature. Ulster's 'Troubles' had not yet erupted, and Ulster's Catholics were still a seriously disadvantaged minority, though the Butler Education Act was beginning to bring a stream of upwardly mobile Catholics into higher education. Many of Heaney's contemporaries at Queen's, therefore, were Catholics like himself, but none of his teachers were, endorsing a sense of dislocation between the tribal loyalties of religion and home on the one hand, and an education into a more sophisticated but alien modernity on the other. As an undergraduate at Queen's Heaney had published apprentice poems under the characteristically self-deprecatory pen-name 'Incertus'. But while13lecturing in a teacher-training college in the early 1960s he became a member of the Belfast Group of poets meeting in the home of Philip Hobsbawm, and formed lifelong friendships with Derek Mahon and Michael Longley. In these years, too, encounter with the harshly authentic rural poetry of Ted Hughes and of Patrick Kavanagh helped Heaney to nd his own distinctive voice. His rst book, Death of a Naturalist, published by Faber in 1966, established him at once as a major talent: In the age of the Vietnam War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the Beatles, Heaney's poetry vividly evoked the sounds and sights of an older and apparently immemorial way of life, ..........the squelch and slap Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge Through living roots. The rst poem in the book, 'Digging', from which those lines come, and Heaney's heart-rending elegy for his dead four-year-old brother, 'Mid term Break', almost immediately found their way into anthologies and school syllabuses, launching him on the trajectory that would make him the world's best-known poet. But it was the publication of his fourth collection, North, in 1975, that catapulted Heaney into international celebrity. The poems of Northaddressed the horrors of the Northern Irish Troubles both directly, in mordant and sometimes angry verses on road-blocks and police harassment, the voice of what he once described as 'a young aggravated Irish Catholic male', and more symbolically, through powerfully disturbing poems evoking the brutalities of the prehistoric andViking past, most famously a series of poems based on photographs of the 'bog bodies' of Scandinavian Iron-age victims of ritual murder. Northsharply divided opinion. Helen Vendler, the most influential American critic of modern poetry, hailed it as a major achievement and a 'signature' volume comparable to Eliot's Prufrockor Yeat's The Tower. By contrast, the Belfast poet Ciaran Carson denounced Heaney as the 'laureate of violence', and dismissed the mythologising poems on the bog bodies as mythic prettication of the unheroic savageries of the Troubles. Most of the poems in Northwere fact written not in Ulster but in the rural seclusion of a borrowed cottage in County Wicklow. Heaney, by now married to Marie Devlin and with two small sons, had left Belfast in 1972, to take his chances as a full-time writer and broadcaster in southern Ireland. Inevitably at the height of the Troubles, some viewed the departure of the most celebrated Catholic writer in the Province as desertion in the face of the enemy. Heaney himself felt the urgent need to give his writing space, and to resist the 'quest for poetry as a diagram of political attitudes'. Northwas to prove the turning-point of Heaney's career, and its impact was consolidated in 1979 by the publication of Field Work, Heaney's own favourite among his books. He was increasingly in demand on the lecture and reading14circuit on both sides of the Atlantic, and by 1980 Faber had published both his Selected Poems, and a volume of his critical essays. In 1981 he became a visiting professor at Harvard, and four years later was elected as Boylston Professor of Rhetoric there. From now on he would spend four months of each year teaching at Harvard, and the rest of the year writing at home with his family in Ireland. Major works continued to pour out, most notably Sweeney Astray (1983), a remarkable version of a medieval Irish verse saga, and Station Island (1984), a Dantesque journey to the other world set on the pilgrimage island of Lough Derg, in which Heaney confronted his own past and his vocation as a writer. Honours now began to descend on him in drifts, and in 1989 he was elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford. The lectures he gave there, eloquent exercises in empathic appreciations of poets he loved or admired, and unfashionably free of techni - calities, resulted in his most important prose volume, The Redress of Poetry (1994). Heaney's association with Magdalene began in May 1995, a few months before the announcement of his Nobel Prize. His friend and Harvard colleague Helen Vendler was that year's Parnell Fellow. She suggested that the College might host a public conversation between herself and Heaney about his work, which duly took place on May 31st. It was a remarkable occasion, full of characteristically vivid utterance. Heaney, a gifted translator from several languages, was at work at the time on his celebrated version of Beowulf, and he spoke revealingly about the relationship between that work and his own original poetry. His recent writing, he explained, had striven towards the higher, lighter and more self-consciously crystalline vocabulary which characterised the radiant twelve-line 'squarings' in Seeing Things , (1991), but he was aware of the danger of losing touch with his own original diction. 'When I began to write , I think that the Anglo-Saxon thumps and grunts were part of the noise that I made that I liked...I wanted it to be fairly thick- witted, and refusing the lambent.' Now, having moved away from that beginning, he felt the need to recover something of that massiveness of language, a problem in modern English because 'the Anglo-Saxon line is made up of huge kind of ingots - dungh, dungh, dungh - and all we have is a little set of tinkles to match'. That same summer, Heaney was awarded the Nobel Prize. The College sent him as a congratulatory gift a ne rst edition of Yeat's Winding Stair, with the signature of the poet Edwin Muir, whom Heaney greatly admired, and which had, with perfect timing, turned up just then in Galloway and Porter's rare books department. Friendly contact with several members of the College continued and grew, and in 1999 Heaney was offered and accepted the Honorary Fellowship in the Arts whose previous occupants had included Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, and T S Eliot. During his 1995 visit Heaney had spent a long time poring over the Hardy poetic manuscripts in the College's Old Library. Characteristically, the clinching factor for him in accepting the Fellowship was not the association with Eliot, but the fact that he would be a successor to Hardy. Heaney's visits to Magdalene were always joyously sociable occasions, and he greatly valued his Fellowship. When in 2005 the College was outbid by its rich15Oxford sister-College for a portrait of Heaney by Peter Edwards, Heaney himself generously gave us a cast of the ne 1968 portrait-bust by the Belfast sculptor, Carolyn Mulholland, (now displayed in Cripps Court). One specially notable visit was in November 2008 as part of the College's 'Festival of Landscape', when, in tandem with the palaeoecologist Professor Valerie Hall (subsequently Parnell Fellow), Heaney delighted a packed audience by reading and discussing eleven poems related to the theme of 'bogs and fens'. Heaney sometimes suggested that the Nobel Prize had come to him too soon, fearing that the consequent surge in celebrity, and the responsibilities to the culture which he felt that celebrity imposed, might have deflected him from his proper work. In fact, despite a stroke in 2006, he remained astonishingly productive. There were four further collections of poems, including his movingnal book, Human Chain (2010), full of tender memorialisation and intimations of mortality. There were also many volumes of translations, from Middle English, Old Irish, Scots Gaelic, Italian, Russian, and Czech (the latter carried out in collaboration). Despite growing frailty, he continued to read and lecture to huge audiences, invariably gracious, modest, and electrically memorable. Thanks to Marie's presence of mind in seeking immediate medical help, Heaney had made a remarkable recovery from his 2006 stroke. But it left him frail, with a permanent heart condition - he joked, characteristically, 'Blessed are the pace-makers'. Always driven by a sense of his obligations to his readers and duty as a public intellectual, he continued with a reduced but still demanding round ofappearances and readings, till in August 2013 a fall during an evening out with friends revealed a serious heart problem which required remedial open-heartsurgery. The operation, scheduled immediately, would certainly have left him greatly diminished. Mercifully, he died on the way to the operating theatre, minutes after texting Marie the message noli timere- don't be afraid. It was a measure of his impact on the wider culture that on the Sunday after his death, an 80,000-strong crowd of Gaelic football fans in Dublin's Croagh Park Stadium stood for a three minute ovation when Heaney's photograph was projected on to the screens. It was Magdalene's immense privilege to have as an Honorary Fellow one of the greatest writers of our age, who was also a radiantly good man. Heaney combined a realistic awareness of his own literary stature, with great personal warmth and an utterly unaffected modesty. Two Magdalene anecdotes illustrate this rare combination of apparently contrasting qualities. When Cambridge awarded Helen Vendler an honorary doctorate, Heaney came over for the ceremony, staying with Magdalene friends. He bought an antique book from David's as a gift for Helen, but forgot to get a card. His host was able to supply one, but then noticed that Heaney was inscribing it in pencil, although he normally used a fountain-pen and jet black ink. Asked why he was writing in pencil, he said simply, 'It's such a beautiful card, she might want to reuse it'! An equally eloquent incident occurred in 2008, when Heaney took part in the Magdalene 'Landfest'. Having a free day to ll, Heaney eagerly accepted the16suggestion of a trip to Helpston near Peterborough, to visit the birth-place and the grave of the 19th-century peasant poet, John Clare, whom he greatly admired, and who had formed the subject of one of the best of his Oxford poetry lectures. Clare's grave-stone carries a translation of the classical tag 'A poet is born, not made', apt for the unschooled talent of a peasant poet. After viewing it, Heaney visited the church, and was invited to sign the visitor's book. He took his fountain pen, smiled, and wrote: 'Seamus Heaney: born, and made'. It's not a bad epitaph for an inspired poet who was also master craftsman.

Born 1918. Educated at Methodist schools, University College, Fort Hare and University of Witwatersrand. Johannesburg Legal Practice, 1952. Imprisonment, 1963-11 Feb 1990. President of the Republic of South Africa, 10 May 1994-1999; President of the SA African National Congress, 1991-1997. Jawahlarlal Nehru Prize, India, 1979, Simon Bolivar Prize, UNESCO, 1983, Sakharov Prize, 1988, Nobel Peace Prize, jointly 1993. Honorary Fellow, Magdalene College, 2000. Married Gra\u00e7a Machel (third wife). Died 5 Dec 2013, aged 95. 'The most respected man, the most admired leader, in the world', John Simpson (1963) called him, and it was our unique privilege to have him as an Honorary Fellow for the last thirteen years of his life. The College's portrait of Nelson Mandela, prominently displayed in Cripps Court, is paired with one of the College's most illustrious Masters, Peter Peckard (1781-1797). The rationale for this is that Peckard was a pioneer advocate of human rights and equality regardless 18of ethnicity, the friend and patron of Olaudah Equiano 'the African', the black abolitionist; Peckard preached the rst sermons against the Atlantic Slave Trade which launched the campaign which lead to its abolition in 1807. Slavery itself ended in most of the British empire from 1833, after a further campaign in which Magdalene men were prominent. Then on 26 December 1835 Charles Grant, newly created Lord Glenelg, as secretary of state for the colonies, issued a momen- tous state paper announcing his decision to disallow the military annexation of Xhosaland in the Eastern Cape of South Africa, a claim he rejected as resting 'on no solid foundation of international law or justice'. Lord Glenelg was very much a Magdalene man (1795, Fellow 1802-1818) who had been deeply influenced by Peckard's teaching and sermons, and he was determined to preserve Xhosa independence, insisting on the doctrine that justice and conciliation required respect for the 'inalienable rights of nations to their lands' as 'the only policy which it becomes this country to observe'. This was not, however, the way in which the British empire developed. Xhosaland lost its independence in 1847. Mandela was born there seventy years later, son of the Chief of the Thembu tribe. Mandela went to a Methodist school at Qunu at the age of seven, proudly wearing trousers for the rst time instead of a pinned tribal blanket. On his rst day Miss Mdingane gave him an English name (missionaries disapproved of African ones), so Rohihlahla became Nelson - the teacher never explained why she had chosen this name. He received an English education, which continued at the Methodist mission school at Mqhekezweni in Thembuland. Young Mandela attended church every Sunday. In order to study Law, he went to the (non-European) University College of Fort Hare, and then to the University of Witwatersrand. He devoted years to the study and practice of Law. But in the face of the over- whelming oppression and evils of the apartheid regime established after 1948 by a hard-line doctrinaire Afrikaner government which denied the most basic human rights to the majority of the South African population, Mandela found the call to lead the freedom struggle increasingly insistent. For daring to challenge the apartheid regime he was put on trial for treason between 1956 and 1961 but was acquitted. All his legal and forensic skills could not, however, avert the inevitable, and in 1962 he was sentenced to ve years in prison; tried on further charges from 1963, he was sentenced to life imprisonment on the notorious Robben Island (off the coast of Cape Town). For his courageous leadership of black Africans he was thus made to pay dearly in the disruption of his family and professional life. He endured his incarceration and its attendant hardships with exemplary fortitude and considerable creativity. When he emerged from it in 1990 after 27 years, it was with astonishing good humour and magnanimity. Treading now the path of political conciliation, the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, jointly with South African President F W de Klerk, signalled to the world the new situation emerging in the Republic. In April 1994 for the rst time in his life Mandela was able to cast his vote. A month later, in May 1994, he became the rst black President of South Africa.19So what enabled 'a child of farm-workers [to] become the president of a great nation'? (his own words). Mandela had no doubt that education was the key: 'Education is the great machine of personal development, it is what we make out of what we have, not what we are given, that separates one person from another' (Long walk to freedom, p 194). It was not the least of the cynical iniquities of apartheid that the Bantu Education Act of 1953 was designed to compromise and degrade the education of those 90% of African children who attended various English-language (as opposed to Afrikaans) mission schools. Better educational opportunities at all levels was thus at the heart of the programme of Mandela's government. Mandela responded enthusiastically when a South African businessman, Chris von Christierson (1969) and friends in 1995 were able to fund post-graduate scholarships to Magdalene, and suggested to him that he might like to attach his name to the scholarships. He readily gave his approval, expressing his gratitude to the College for their initiative in a scheme which would assist the development of South African post-graduate expertise. Mandela could not at his age accept all the associational invitations which came his way, and his patronage was carefully guarded. But with the Mandela/Magdalene Scholarships successfully established, it was a relatively short step towards his seeing the logic of accepting an honorary fellowship here in 2000. His admission ceremony took place on 2 May 2001 during a short visit to London. The occasion was attended by the Vice-Chancellor and the College Visitor (with Lady Braybrooke), HE the High Commissioner for South Africa, and representa- tives of the Cambridge Commonwealth Trust. He came out of the skies at 10.30 in the morning by helicopter, which somehow managed to land on the croquet pitch in the Fellows' Garden. After his admission ceremony in Chapel he addressed the assembled company in Hall. Although he was 82, his voice was strong and clear and he showed remarkable intellectual vigour and oratorical command. There was a certain aura of regality about him, despite the easy informality. We felt we were, perhaps for the rst time, in the presence of unmistakable greatness. R H Mandela's visit on 2 May 2001 must surely have been the most memorable event the College has ever witnessed. Later that day, Sir Derek Oulton recorded his impressions for his family to read. We reproduce here an edited version of his account. As we sat in Chapel waiting for him, we heard the helicopter descending noisily just outside. And then suddenly the familiar gure was there among us, in his trademark coloured shirt under his scarlet honorary Cambridge doctorate gown. His knees give him some trouble and he had to be helped up the steps, but he then walked pretty condently forward, leaning on the Master's arm, as our new organ crashed out a triumphant salutation. For the long walker to freedom, the opening hymn, Bunyan's 'He who would valiant be/ 'Gainst all disaster' was movingly apt. And then Professor Cornish, the20President, read out a formal citation for the conferring of the fellowship, the compo- sition of which he had shared with his predecessor Dr Hyam. He started by saying: Master, I present Dr Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela for admission as an Honorary Fellow. Who could approach this task otherwise than with a mixture of deep pleasure and awe? He is one of the world's most admired, courageous and noble- minded leaders. His is a remarkable story: from champion stick-ghter among the boys of Thembuland to 'father of the nation', from Johannesburg attorney to freedom ghter, from the mysterious 'Black Pimpernel' of the resistance movement in his country to its rst black State President. We are proud to associate him with a line of Honorary Fellows, not previously undergraduates ofthe College, who have brought us their special distinction: Thomas Hardy, Rudyard Kipling, T S Eliot, C S Lewis, Benjamin Britten and Seamus Heaney, three of them Nobel Laureates. Before inviting the Master to admit him, the President ended by saying: 'Locked away in that island cell, now so notorious, he was a portent which could not be hidden. After his release, when he stood with F W de Klerk to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, a clarion of high hope rang out round the world. Even then there was still no easy walk to freedom; but once he was elected President of a new, and newly-respected, South Africa, he was determined to stamp on it the virtues of democracy, reconciliation and non-racial progress.' Mandela signed the Order Book and was admitted to his Fellowship. The cere- mony concluded with the Choir singing Tippett's marvellous arrangement of the spiritual Steal away, which seemed to express perfectly the moment and the man. Nelson Mandela with the Master, Sir John Gurdon We then went into Hall and Mandela came in while the Choir, by now up in the gallery, greeted him with a really splendid rendering of Nkosi Sikelel' i-Africa , the South African national anthem. By great good fortune they had recently been on a 21recital tour of South Africa, and had practised it to such good effect that Thabo Makapula, our rst Mandela scholar, now back for a second time and reading for a PhD in anthropology, told us afterwards that he turned round to look, because so good were their accents that he was convinced it was a black choir that was singing! Nelson Mandela meeting Mandela Scholars Mandela's scarlet university robe was exchanged for his black, Honorary Fellow's gold-corded gown, and Professor Gurdon, the Master, made him a warm speech of welcome. Mandela was then helped to the lectern. He's a strikingly big man. Very tall, grey-haired and most impressive in appearance. He gave an immensely generous speech. He started, splendidly, by saying that he was very nervous because he was quite unsuited to the honour that had been done to him, rstly because he was a pensioner (polite laughter), secondly because he was unemployed (louder laughter), and thirdly because he had a bad criminal record (uproarious laughter and applause). He spoke of his gratitude for the honour being done to him, but went on to speak of the great legacy that Britain had given to South Africa, in particular in introducing the country to the rule of law, and in respect of education (a topic that all his life has been very close to his heart). On the rst, he told a story against himself. He said that one of the rst things he had done on becoming President had been to make an order adversely affecting the Western Cape Province. The Western Cape had taken him to the Constitutional Court which, he said, was now the highest court in the country, and the President of which had been his attorney when he had been tried for treason. The President of the Court decided the case against him and, when his own supporters were very indignant, Mandela disagreed and said that it was of the greatest importance that everyone should see that the President himself was not above the law. The contrast between Mandela, who upheld the rule of law, and Mugabe in Zimbabwe who had recently forced his Chief Justice to retire because he disliked his judgements, was blinding. 22At the end of his speech the whole Hall rose and gave him a standing ovation. It was a very moving occasion. The Master presented him with a leather-bound copy of The Cries of London and of The Illustrated Pepys. He went on to say, which got a good laugh from Mandela, 'and, which may or may not be of use to you, some Magdalene cuff-links and, which will certainly be of value to you during the rest of your stay in England, a College umbrella'. The Choir then broke into Mbube, a song traditionally sung by South African mineworkers when the going underground was very tough. Mandela obviously knew it well, sprang to his feet and did a little dance. It was this which provoked (almost) everyone into swaying and dancing in the aisles, which came out so splendidly on the television news that evening. And then, just as the honoured guests were leaving, an unplanned inter - vention occurred. Jongi Klaas, one of the Mandela Scholars, smartly dressed in collar and tie, and with his graduate gown on, leaped into the air, crouched down by the ground, leaped up again, pointed at Mandela and poured out a volley of xhosaat him. We were all stunned, Security momentarily alarmed, but Mandela realised it was a 'praise poem', acknowledging it with a broad smile and nods of appreciation. Jongi was greeting him in a traditional ukubongaas 'our great Chief, who gave us hope when we had none'. A D M O Nelson Mandela signing his autobiography, Long walk to freedom 23in memoriam ANDREW BROWN Fellow-Commoner ' Photo: Cambridge University Press Andrew Missak Cleverley Brown, MA, PhD. Born 27 January 1950. Educated at Cranleigh School and Magdalene (1967: Exhibitioner in English; Research student 1972; PhD 1979). Donaldson Bye-Fellow in English 1974; Fellow-Commoner 1 January 1993. Joined Cambridge University Press 1976; Managing Director of Academic Publishing 2002, and Development Director; retired June 2013. Married Lorna Williams 1990; 1 son, 1 daughter. Died 21 January 2014, aged 63. You could say Andy Brown's background was unusual, perhaps even exotic. His father was Capt Edgar George Brown, RN, CBE, his mother Odette Vivian Ekserdjian, an Armenian. His combination of personal skills was equally unusual, both a ne scholar and a successful publishing-executive. He was also a man of rare quality. 24The scholar Andy was fortunate in his supervisors for the English Tripos, who included John Stevens, George Steiner, and Arthur Sale, together with recent Magdalene graduates, John Batchelor (1960) and Gary Waller (1966). (In his turn, as a Bye- Fellow, Andy became one of the supervisors; Alan Rusbridger was one of his pupils.) As for so many other Magdalene students reading English, Arthur Sale was the biggest influence. Arthur regarded him as 'a born scholar, fastidious, meticulous and incredibly industrious': an outstanding and deeply engaged student. John Stevens as Director of Studies found his intellectual qualities as a freshman 'rather over-powering - and, indeed, they seem to over-power him too!'. There was an ebullience and prolixity which he hadn't quite got under control when it came to Tripos; disappointingly, he did not get a First. John and Arthur were convinced that research in literary history would bring out the best in him. However, Andy decided to go off to teach English as a foreign language with the British Council in Tehran, Iran, followed by a year as a Visiting Lecturer at Michigan State University, 1970-71. A M C Brown as an undergraduate (1967) The two years abroad proved to be crucial for his intellectual development. An excellent linguist, he published a little book on The Aeolian harp in European literature, 1591-1892 (Bois de Boulogne Press, 1970). He decided against specialising in Turkish studies. But above all he hit upon a brilliant idea for a research project in Victorian literature. Edward Bulwer Lytton (1803-1873) wrote 27 novels, and a quantity of poems and plays. Mostly the novels were historical (The last days of Pompeii, 1834), but The coming race(1871) was one of the earliest examples of science ction (about the emergence of a super-race, the Vril-ya). He was a phenomenally popular author, and by the end of the nineteenth century there was a gigantic corpus of multi- volume editions of Bulwer Lytton. Yet subsequently he fell into a mysterious total 25obscurity, without any comprehensive critical evaluation. Andy realised that Bulwer Lytton was, despite his twentieth-century neglect, a fascinating and important gure in the Victorian literary and political world, reflecting, perhaps more than anyone, 'the energetic multiplicity of the Victorian age'. Politically Bulwer rose to be Secretary of State for the Colonies in Lord Derby's Tory administration from 1858 to 1859, making decisions signicant for Canadian and Australian constitutional development. As a central gure in the literary world - and this was something Andy was to prove - Bulwer's novels were out-sold in his life-time only by Dickens. Andy's ambitious research project was approved and Professor Ian Jack became his supervisor. His dissertation, 'The \"metaphysical novels\" of Edward Bulwer Lytton', was awarded a doctorate in 1979. By then, however, having decided an academic career was problematic, he was professionally engaged in publishing other people's work and had no time to turn his own thesis into a book. Had he done so, it might have forestalled what he regarded as a lamentable development, the establishment in 1983 (at San Jose California) of a 'Bulwer Lytton Prize', a competition for the worst opening sentence of a novel, mockingly inviting comparison with Bulwer's own beginning, 'It was a dark and stormy night' (Paul Gifford, 1830). Not, he thought, at all a bad opening for a story about a high- wayman, and in any case the nal sentence was rather good, 'The very worst use to which you can put a man is to hang him'. Andy would far rather Bulwer Lytton was remembered for the most famous words he ever wrote, 'the pen is mightier than the sword'. In 1993 Andy edited George Eliot's novel Romola(1863), ironically for Oxford University Press, which re-issued it as a 'World's Classic' paperback in 1998. With his luminous Introduction, it is surely the denitive edition of an exceptionally complex and erudite work, convincingly set in Renaissance Florence. Andy was able to bring to it all the requisite textual expertise and knowledge of Italian language and history. If he thus produced an edition worthy of what many consider a great novelist's best book, the lesser Bulwer Lytton too was eventually to have his day. Andy was invited to contribute a long essay on him for the prestigious Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). It is one of the star entries in the new ODNB, sensitive and stylish, magisterial and memorable. R H The publisher Andy joined the Cambridge University Press in 1976 as a Graduate Trainee, and remained there for the rest of his working life. He worked initially as a junior editor in the humanities, becoming Senior Editor for Literature in 1983 (having established our signicant presence in American literary studies). He then assumed managerial positions in the Humanities group, prior to becoming26Director of the newly-merged Humanities and Social Sciences group at the end of 1997. He was asked to take on a gradually expanding role across the whole of academic publishing (extending to STM - Science Technical Medical - and journals), culminating in his appointment as Managing Director, Academic and Professional Publishing in 2002. Andy did all this with a unique and distinctive personal style, 'sometimes grumpy but never grand' to use his own self-description. Forensically sharp (and funny) in his criticism of ill-thought-out or misconceived publishing projects, but (as many colleagues will know) hugely supportive of the careers and aspirations of individual members of the Academic team worldwide, Andy was never a great believer in complex systems or managerial structures. In essence he controlled the Academic books business worldwide through three pieces of paper (and they were paper throughout his tenure): the Syndicate [Directors'] Paper, the Sales Forecast, and the Staff Salary progression form, over each of which he exercised careful scrutiny. Andy always believed that the most important single decision for any publishing organisation is what to publish, and under his leadership the rigorous quality control enshrined in the whole 'Syndicate process' was never allowed to lapse. The growth in both sales and protability of the Academic group during Andy's tenure as Managing Director was considerable and sustained, and well above industry norms. In addition to very careful control, always, of the question what are we going to publish, Andy also focussed sharply on the two related primary publishing questions of how many are we going to print (reflecting still a largely physical world of book-buying), and how much are we going to charge? At the same time Andy presided over the signicant expansion of CUP's digital presence, rstly in journals and then extending into books, and he played a signicant personal role in the global expansion of the academic business, with a particular interest in and afnity for the development of the Cambridge publishing propo sition throughout Asia-Pacic and the Middle-East, regions that now represent perhaps 20% of CUP's global academic sales (about \u00a3112m in 2012). This agenda he continued to pursue in the nal phase of his Press career, as Development Director for Academic Publishing, and the substantial sales contract with Saudi Arabia that went through during April 2013, a transaction initiated by Andy and colleagues nearly four years ago, was perhaps a tting conclusion to his Press career. As a publisher and indeed scholar and bibliophile in his own right Andy of course had his own particular enthusiasms, and he always enjoyed a good editorial tussle, notably with the legendary gure of Jerome Lindon, Samuel Beckett's publisher at Editions de Minuit and one of the principal obstacles to the edition of the Letters of Samuel Beckett which the Press is so proud now to be publishing. It is hard to think of anybody who in modern times cared more than Andy about what the Press stands for and the delivery of its core scholarly and pedagogic mission.27He was one of the most energetic and enquiring minds any of us has ever met. He will be great missed, both by the wider Press and academic community around the world, by the Fellowship and Staff of Magdalene College, byVictorian scholars and biographers, by retailers and airline staff the world over for whom an encounter with Andy was one never to be forgotten. Peter Phillips & Richard Fisher Andy, the man Some people become important, achieving success and recognition in their eld; they know it and they let you know it. Andy Brown became important, a scholar and publisher of global distinction, but you never quite knew it. He came across as straightforward, likeable, and lively, attentive and fun in conversation; but apart from a vague awareness that he was 'something big in the Press', the breath and scale of his achievements was not immediately apparent. In particular, the global dimension of his network of friends and colleagues (built up over many years of travelling, especially to North America and South-East Asia) was never fully obvious. This is partly because Andy spent more time asking people about them- selves than talking about himself, a surprisingly rare quality in any workplace or community. Andy spent time in College regularly, often brightening up even the dullest Thursday Fellows' lunchtime with a loud laugh and an even louder bow-tie. He was always interested and interesting, keen to talk and listen to anyone regard- less of their status. Many junior colleagues at Magdalene, on meeting him, were delighted by the careful interest he showed in them and their research, the fluency and warmth with which he asked questions and made connections. There were hints too of that convivial sharpness which, as Michael Wheeler writes, made him 'a master of the outrageous comment that puts the other person, or a meeting at ease'. He also displayed immense passion for a remarkably wide range of interests, which included classical music, lm, and Liverpool FC; he was a keen cricketer, at one time playing for a local club, the Remnants. He could switch between interests instantly. At one memorable St Mary Magdalene Feast, Andy was revelling in the publication of the new Cambridge editions of the King James Bible, demon- strating a familiar and rm grasp of the details of translation, exegesis, and printing. Within minutes he was bringing similar critical enthusiasm to bear on the wartime convoy story The Cruel Sea, including a closely-argued analysis of the differences between the book and lm versions. Andy brought to the family home in Queen Edith's Way a lot of books, but also conversation, care, and a strong sense of humour and the ridiculous (generally aimed at himself). He leaves behind Lorna, their children Daniel and Helena, and his brother Anthony, all of whom will of course miss him the most; but the Senior Combination Room in Magdalene will also be a little less lively for the many of us who enjoyed his attentive and enthusiastic company.

After having taught in secondary education in Spain for some years, he embarked on a DPhil in Economic History at Oxford University. Broadly speaking, he is interested in the relationship between institutions and economic development. His doctoral dissertation, focusing on 19th and early-20th century Spain, addresses the dissolution of the communal regime and its influence on different social and economic dimensions. His current research deals with the factors behind different levels of inequality andits repercussions on economic development. Outside academia, he loves playing tennis, reading sci- novels and, occasionally, cooking. HANNAH MALONE has been elected to a Lumley Junior Research Fellowship in Philosophy and History ofArchitecture from 1 October 2014. Irish by birth, she moved to Italy as a young child, and later developed a fascination for the history and culture of that country. She is interested in how politics shapes buildings and cities, and has worked exten- sively on monuments to the dead and on the architecture of Italian Fascism. Following her BA at Trinity College, Dublin, she undertook an MPhil and a PhD at Cambridge. For her doctoral research, she travelled throughout Italy in order to research monumental cemeteries of the nineteenth century. After a year spent at the British School at Rome, and further research relating to Fascist war monuments, Hannah has joined Magdalene to undertake work on Marcello Piacentini who, as the most prominent architect of Mussolini's Fascist regime, might be seen as the Italian equivalent of Albert Speer. Parnell Fellow JANE OHLMEYER is the Parnell Visiting Fellow for 2014-15. She is Erasmus Smith's Professor of Modern History and the founding Vice-President for Global Relations at Trinity College, Dublin (2011-2014).

Senior Tutor's Report With the disappointments of the last couple of years it is pleasing to see a return to our rightful position somewhere within the top ten of the Baxter tables. The bad news rst: relative to the rest of the University our nalists again proved to be a great statistical disappointment, having sunk in the rankings year on year and with the Scientists in particular ending their career at the bottom of the pile. However with data covering all years the picture is far rosier: the percentage of Firsts increasing to an historic high, at just under 25%, some good individual subject performances and both the rst and second years nishing with Tripos results above the University average.37Finalists' ranking. Our nalists again performed particularly poorly overall, indeed appearing relatively weak every year of their Cambridge career. They ended their careers well below the University average. Over the last ve years we have fallen from a signicant 5th place to this year's signicantly poor 22nd, our new position at being the worst showing since 2006 (when we were bottom). In registering this outcome, their tally was 21 Firsts (=23%) and 56 2.1s. However, including fourth years, 87% of the graduating cohort achieved a 2.1 or better, up 5% on last year - this has to be viewed as a success by the wider world. Broader results. It is a healthier picture if we consider all three years as a whole: we have risen nine places to be Baxter-ranked at 9th. The raw number of Firsts recorded (78) has broken the 20% barrier for the eighth time since we rst breached that particular barricade in 2003: the overall percentage of Firsts is 24.2%, the highest in our recorded history. The First/2.1 brigade also rose to just over 78% while at the other end of the spectrum the 2.2s hit our second-lowest level (just over 11% compared to over 16% last year). Our Baxter score indicates we are comfortably above the University average, and our 9th place berth is our third highest position in recent memory. The second year with 23% Firsts & 62% 2.1s have risen sharply to 8th place from last year's dismal 20th and are almost a whole standard deviation above average. Last year they also performed well as Freshers (ranked 7th), so there is hope for an excellent year ahead. The Freshers are also a strong year group - and with 24% Firsts they rise to 5th place overall and are also well above the average. Arts versus Sciences. Our overall Arts position improves from 18th last year to 11th this year, a healthy enough showing somewhere in the middle of what we've achieved since 2005 (when we were bottom). Our overall Science position has also risen from 16th last year to 13th this year, our third best showing in ten years. The Arts nalists improved from last year's 18th to this year's 12th while, as noted above, the Scientists have worsened year-on-year from 16th (as Freshers) to ending life with the wooden spoon this year. Fresher Scientists ranked at 8th look very promising, and the second years, ranked at 7th look even better statistically. Fresher Arts at 5th also look excellent. Five major subjects nd themselves above the University average: Engineering (ranked 2nd overall), Economics, History, Law and MML. University Prizes.

In our rst two terms as the 2014 JCR Committee, we have carried on much of the work of the previous committees, whilst also starting a number of our own initiatives. We have continued the established traditions of hosting 'JCR Superhall' dinners, providing all students with 'Week 5 Welfare Food Packs', offering Pilates on Sunday mornings during exam term, and organising the College BOPs (the fancy dress parties that bookend the Michaelmas and Lent Terms). However, in addition to this, our Welfare Ofcer, Hermione Cox, has introduced a Wednesday Night 'Coffee and Cake Break' for those working late in the Library, whilst our Green and Ethical Ofcer, Rosie Adamson, hosted a very successful inaugural Fair-trade Formal. The most signicant development in JCR business has however been the introduction of a Women's Political Ofcer. At the beginning of the Lent Term a referendum was passed that saw the introduction of an elected Women's Political Ofcer on the Welfare Sub-committee, with separate responsibilities to the Female Welfare Ofcer. Vicky Salt won the subsequent election, and has since worked on a new Sexual Harassment Policy. As well as the more general running of the JCR, all of the individual ofcers have been busy in their distinct areas: Elise Larkin, our Access Ofcer, has worked hard on a number of excellent schemes. She organised the second annual residential scheme, which saw 70 school-children visit Magdalene during the Easter vacation; she has worked to ensure that this year more schools from a broader variety of regions have visited the College than ever before; and she has also initiated a 'Magdalene Ambassador Scheme', establishing a stronger base of student volunteers. Hannah Shaw organised regular events in College, helping to attract people back to the College Bar. As well as the more typical pub quizzes, Hannah has also organised karaoke nights and a casino evening in the bar. She has also worked closely with Alex Lockyer, the Charities Ofcer, so that many of the events have raised money for our three JCR charities, Jimmy's Night Shelter, Marie Curie Cancer Care and Orchid Project. As well as fundraising for the JCR charities, Alex has worked to promote events organised by Cambridge RAG, the University's central charity organisation. Emily, the SAD (Services, Domestic and Academic) Ofcer, ensured the smooth running of the ever-stressful room ballot; and as well as the Fair-trade41Formal, Rosie Adamson, the Green and Ethical Ofcer, has organised the running of the student recycling scheme as well as a student-run bike-workshop. Although the main bulk of their work still lies ahead, Harri Lamden, the Freshers' Rep, organised an excellent range of activities for'Re-Fresher's Week' at the start of the Lent Term, and Alex Gazi, our Open Portfolio Ofcer, masterminded a truly memorable Half-Way Dinner. Middle Common Room President: R Proust; Secretary: A Treasurer: IT Ofcer: D Robertson; Consultant: G Peters. The new committee elected and assembled during the Easter Term continued the previous committee's long-established traditions of regular events: BA dinners, Parlour talks, Parlour dinners, Ceilidh banquets, and a garden party. On the novelty side, the MCR hosted the rst themed banquet under the Cuban colours of the 1960s: the missile crisis era. Exotic cocktails and Latin jazz music welcomed diners into a Benson Hall lled with pineapples, paintings and bunting. The MCR room is being refreshed; various appliances are being replaced and a spring-cleaning brought the whole room to a shiny state. Some changes to the MCR constitution were proposed to graduates in a referendum - twice. However, because there was no quorum - for either vote - the constitution remained unchanged. 2SOCIETIES, CLUBS AND SPORTS The Editor received the following club and society reports for 2013-14: Boat Club. (Captain: A Knights). The Michaelmas Term began promisingly for Magdalene Boat Club in the Fairbairn Cup, with ve new novice crews, a Senior Men's IV and VIII and two Senior Women's VIII. Notably, the rst Novice Men's crew nished a very impressive 7th, and the Senior Men's IV came in 5th overall. This provided a strong platform for the two bumps campaigns coming later in the year. Lent Bumps saw each Men's crew bumping at least once, with the 3rd Men moving up two places, the 2nd Men nishing eventually down two, and the 1st Men's crew ghting to stay level on the divide between the rst and second division, being bumped twice and bumping twice. The 1st Women's boat was bumped on days 1 and 4 while rowing over on 2 and 3 to nish down two places. Following the Lent Bumps the Magdalene Boat Club was also represented in both Goldie and the Blue Boat on the 6th April in the Boat Race. Angus Knights stroked the Goldie crew, while Helge Gruetjen sat in the 5 seat of the Blue Boat - some achievement for the Magdalene Boat Club which taught both athletes to row from scratch at Magdalene.42The May Bumps, the pinnacle of the rowing year in Cambridge, were extremely positive for the club. No Men's crew was bumped at all during the campaign. The 3rd Men's crew got off to a flying start, bumping up to be the sandwich boat and then into the fourth division! They bumped again on day 3 to go up three in total. The 2nd Men's crew ended a gutsy string of row-overs by bumping Emma III in a ght to keep away from Clare Hall I, going up 1 overall. The 1st Men's boat did their fair share of rowing-over as sandwich boat on days 1 and 2, bumping Homerton and then Girton to go up 2, rmly back in the rst division and delivering Helge Gruetjen (Blue 2014) his rst two bumps in 25 days of bumps racing! The 2nd Women's boat was in a difcult position, following in the footsteps of last year's crew who moved up seven places on the river. Being chased by either rst or second boats, they moved down four, but showed a character which bodes well for next year. The 1st Women's boat avoided spoons with a row-over on day 2, ending down 3. Women's Football. (Captain: Sophie Canham). The team have been going from strength to strength since joining forces with Sidney Sussex three years ago. We have gained many talented and enthusiastic players from both colleges who have contributed massively to the team making the past season our most successful yet. We won the intercollegiate plate after a 3-1 win over Downing/Kings in the nal, despite being a player down for most of the game. We were also unbeaten in the league, leading to our promotion to division 2. We are grateful to Calum Harvey- Scholes and Jamie Abbots for coaching our training sessions and refereeing matches throughout the year. Mixed Hockey. (Men's Captain: James Heaven; Ladies' Captain: Grace Taylor). With limited numbers and some exceptional women hockey players, the men's hockey team has now most denitely become a mixed hockey team, and one that it is great to be a part of. We have had a difcult season this year, losing some key players and only having two or three enrolments. However, all of those have shown excellent commitment, with many players playing every match despite some heavy defeats. Indeed, the spirit of the team was perhaps best demonstrated by a rst half performance mid-way through the season in which despite playing with only seven players (against an all male team of eleven) we went in at half time only 1-0 down, having conceded only from a short corner. Mixed Netball. (Captain: Sophie Kelly). This year has been excellent for the Magdalene Mixed Netball team. We have managed to win almost all our matches and nish second in the division - a real achievement as we were only promoted last year. The team has beneted from many new players and their height and enthusiasm, but would be impossible to run without the core mixed netballers. Rugby Club. (Captain: A Goodwin). We are this season's Spanish Cup Champions with an emphatic win over Magdalen, Oxford. After a stop-start league due to43particularly inclement winter conditions, Magdalene also enjoyed semi-nalist status at the sun-soaked university-wide Rugby Sevens Tournament. Club Secretary and College Marshal Bob Smith's nurturing guidance has the squad in healthy shape with a high percentage of returning players. Two Magdalenites, Beth Price and Charlotte Browning, played part in a stunning University Women's Rugby season winning 9 out of 10 league games, including all home games, narrowly missing out on the Midlands 1A title on points difference. Swim Team. (Captain: Samantha Mullender). From a single representative in 2011-12, the Magdalene swim team has denitely gone from strength to strength. Despite being one of the smaller colleges, we have elded both men's and women's teams for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 competitions, one of only six colleges this year to do so. This year a strong women's team coming from a variety of past swimming backgrounds managed to nish 6th, bringing the College to a respectable 6th place overall and only 2 points behind John's in 5th. English students at Hatfield House Old Palace English Society. The Annual Magdalene English Dinner took place this year at a nearby restaurant and there was a very nearly full turn out of graduates, under- graduates and Fellows along with several much-valued supervisors and members of the wider 'team'. The post-prandial quiz was on characters in ction, and Professor Cooper maintained the time-honoured tradition of heading up the winning team. The highlight of the summer was our annual trip, which this year included a morning visit to Hateld House (where Elizabeth I was brought up before her accession to the throne). We travelled to Ascott House (the site of a Jacobean house demolished to make way for a mock-Jacobean house in the 1830s) and Wing Church in Buckinghamshire, which has a plausible claim to be among the oldest churches in the country. The day concluded with an excellent Italian meal in Letchworth, the rst Garden City. 44History Society. (Presidents: Aiden Irwin-Singer and Chris Thomas). The History Society had another active year. Aside from the usual programme of social events, members heard a variety of talks: in November, Dr Sujit Sivasundaram (Caius) on 'From the UL to Ebay: the visual history of the port of Colombo c.1900 and some problems with connected histories'; in February, at the annual Parlour Dinner, Dr Colin Shindler (Caius), on his life and career as a writer and cultural historian of the late twentieth century; in March, Professor Elisabeth van Houts (Emmanuel), on 'Medieval voices in favour of clerical marriage: the curious case of Serlo of Bayeux (d. before 1122)'. On a very different note, in February the Society also played host to a large audience in the Cripps Auditorium for 'The rst draft of history' when Dr Andrew Arsan (St John's) chaired 'a conversation on the Middle East and its recent past', between two former UK diplomats in the region, Stuart Laing (Master of Corpus Christi, and former ambassador to Oman and Kuwait) and Edward Chaplin (former ambassador to Jordan and Iraq). An enthralling afternoon of third-year dissertation presentations was again well attended. Law Society. (President: Sebastian Witte; Secretary: Will Thong). This year saw the usual Law Society combination of academic, careers, and social events. In the Michaelmas Term we held our annual exhibition moot against Jesus College, sponsored by 4 New Square, Lincoln's Inn, in which the College was represented by Will Thong and Vivian Chow, and we were glad to welcome back a number of non-resident members now in the legal profession for our annual law careers evening. In the Lent Term we held the annual Magdalene Mooting Competition for new law undergraduates, sponsored by Maitland Chambers, Lincoln's Inn. The nal, judged by Mr Mark Cunningham QC and Mr Laurie Scher of Maitland Chambers, was won by Natalie So. The annual moot against Downing College, sponsored by Clyde & Co., on a difcult problem concerning criminal joint enterprise liability, was won for Magdalene, by Natalie So and Annabelle Atkins. It was a great pleasure to welcome Ms Julia Dias QC as guest of honour at the annual Magdalene Lawyers' Dinner, an event founded - as is so much legal at Magdalene - by her late father Mr R W M Dias. The year was rounded off by a garden party after exams, at which the Society was able to thank Dr O'Keefe for all that he has done for law at Magdalene, and to wish him well as he moves to UCL to take up his Chair. Ars David Matthews, Phoebe Jayes, Lauren Brown; Blog editors: Arthur Goodwin, James Dobbyn, Rosalind Dobson). The College's arts magazine, which is delivered free to all undergraduate pigeonholes, has been building on the artistic innovations of previous editors upon celebrating its 25th anniversary last year. With a new editorial team, Ars Magnahas attracted an increasing number of contributors and a greater readership due to its new thematic issues and improved design: themes included45'Pantheon', 'Liminal', and 'Change', which sparked some interesting responses. We have even been contacted by the JCRs of other colleges wishing to use our model for their magazines. Though our attempt to expand to other media via a blog has been slow, we are hopeful that this will become a key component, and will continue to attract the wealth of creative writing (ction and articles) which has characterised the past. 3 SPORTING DISTINCTIONS The following obtained Full Blues (*) or Half-Blues during 2013-14: Athletics: A Stanley* format S B Eton Fives: Abbott Pentathlon: T Wilson* Rowing: H F Gruetjen* Rugby League: O R J Holmes, S Rylands Rugby Union: W Briggs*, F W B Sanders* Squash: G Johnson Tennis: S J Ashcroft * Women's Athletics: K Turner* Women's Eton Fives: E Browning* Women's Swimming: S Mullender Women's Trampolining: H Smith (The Editor is grateful to Mr Keall for verifying this list.)

Our new Deputy College Librarian, Annie Gleeson, began work at the end of April 2014. She brings a valuable range of skills, including a detailed knowledge of the Heritage circulation system. She has already taken steps to improve the Library's responsiveness to book requests, and is currently exploring the use of social media to promote new holdings. Physical improvements to the Library are also taking effect: window-seats have been recovered, new waste-paper bins have been installed, and a periodic 'deep clean' established to prevent the build up of dust. In the summer, worn carpeting was replaced, the table and desk-tops renovated, and paint-work redecorated. Mrs Gleeson is working on projects of shared concern with the new Libraries Assistant, Sophie Connor, and the new Deputy Pepys Librarian, Catherine Sutherland. A blog has been started which will make available our Library news to all members of the College and more widely. The Library received a number of gifts, including a major donation to the collection of Kipling books, made in memory of her late husband by Mrs Millie Johnston-Jones. Mr Robinson and Professor Boyle also have made substantial donations of books to the College Library. PEPYSLIBRARY .During 2013-14, the Pepys Library attracted 73 scholars to work on the collection, as well as 2893 members of the public at the regular opening times. In an expanded provision for pre-booked tours, we welcomed 26 groups(including school groups) with 397 visitors. It is always a pleasure to see members of the College in the historic Libraries and this year we had 16 special openings for College events (reunions, general admission etc). During the year, the Pepys Librarian gave 28 specialist talks on aspects of the collection to groups, seminars and conference delegates. The papers of Mr Robert Latham, editor of the Diary and formerly Pepys Librarian, which came to the College in 1995 after his death, have been assessed, sorted, arranged for readers' use, and catalogued by Dr Hyam and Dr Hughes. The papers will be stored in the Pepys Reference Library. Miss Sutherland, the Deputy Librarian (Pepys and Special Collections) has reviewed the small bookstall for visitors to the Library; and we now offer several attractive cards depicting the Pepys Library and some of its treasures, as well as other items, which are proving popular with visitors. OLD LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES . It is probably true to say that there have been more visitors to the Old Library in the past twelve months than in the whole period since it was located in its present rooms in 1850. Though partly owing to an initiative to welcome scholars more actively, this is most properly attributable to an imaginative series of exhibitions which revealed the astounding store of treasures in the historic holdings of the College. During the year, 63 readers47worked on materials from the Old Library and Archives, with the diaries of A C Benson and Dean Inge, as well as our small but important collection of medieval manuscripts, attracting particular attention. The following exhibitions were mounted in the Old Library, attracting a total of 576 visitors: Traces of Italy in the Old Library. Maps of Genoa and Florence from Georg Braun, Civitates Orbis Terrarium (1572) 20 September to 13 October 2013: 'Traces of Italy in the Old Library: Maps and Early Printed Books of Italy', curated by Dr Hughes to coincide with a conference run by Dr Stoddart. 9 November to 18 November 2013: 'Masters of Magdalene, 1713 to 2013, Waterland to Williams', curated by Dr Hyam. The Art of the Scribe and the Printer. Notice the Chinese scrolls displayed, from the I A Richards Collection. 16 January to 30 January 2014: 'The Art of the Scribe and the Printer: some of the treasures of the Old Library in manuscript and ne printing', curated by Dr Hyam. 4813 February to 'The Old Library: Work in Progress': curated by Dr Hughes, to show current conservation projects. 7 June to 24 June 2014: 'The College and the Great War, a Centenary Exhibition', curated by Dr Hyam. The Battle of the Somme, 1916, taken from a photograph album compiled by George Turner, the brother of Francis Turner, Fellow, and displayed at the 'Great War' Exhbition The Old Library was open for members of the College and their guests on four Thursdays before dinner during the Michaelmas and Lent Terms, and also welcomed a visit from the Buckingham Society. Dr Hughes has overseen the production of a revised catalogue of the forty- ve medieval and early modern manuscripts in the Old Library, updating M R James's catalogue (1909) and making it available online from October 2014. Dr Wang is producing a hand-list of the Chinese scrolls in the I A Richards Collection. Miss Sutherland and Miss Connor have begun a programme of cataloguing the books of the Old Library on to the Newton catalogue. 49VI CHAPEL AND CHOIR Sacristan:W T Helms. Wardens:R Adamson, H M T Bee, T Boniface, J Brewster, S Burston, D Dold, H Hill, Z Lloyd, K S Macfarlane, M Nussbaumer, O C Dalseme-Stubbs, J Redburn, M T E Robinson, M L Skipsey. Organ Scholars: R Colman, P Sosnina. The ftieth anniversary of the death of C S Lewis (Fellow 1954-1963) was marked by a packed Commemorative Evensong in Chapel when the Master spoke. He also preached at a Service in Westminster Abbey for the dedication of the CSL memorial in Poets' Corner; Bishop Barrington-Ward KCMG, the Chaplain, and Professor Cooper (as the then current holder of Lewis's chair) represented the College. As well as the ever-popular Advent and Christmas Carol Services the Choirsang a concert of sacred and secular Christmas music at St Matthew's Westminster which was packed with alumni from London and nearby; a second Christmas Concert - at Pepys's church, St Olave's Hart Street - will take place this year. Other popular services included the Corporate Communions in the Michaelmas and Lent Terms, where around 90 members of College enjoyed the service, and the ensuing curry in the light and airy environment of the Cripps Court Gallery. Professor Duffy preached at a well-attended service ofVespers in Latin sung by monks of Douai and Ealing Abbeys. Preachers we welcomed included the Bishop of Chelmsford, Bishop Anthony Priddis, the Deans of Ely, Melbourne, and Guildford Cathedrals, and theArchdeacon of Huntingdon and Wisbech. We also heard from the Vicar of St Bene't's, the Vicar of Hateld Broad Oak and Bush End in Essex, the Revd Dr Rob McDonald (Ridley Hall), Dr Simon Gathercole (Faculty of Divinity), the Revd Canon Dr Simon Oliver (University of Nottingham), and Mgr Jeremy Fairhead (Camden Town parish). The Chaplain of the Fleet preached on Remembrance Sunday. A particular delight was the return of two former Magdalene under - graduates to preach - the Revd Dr Stephen Hampton (1990, now Dean and Senior Tutor of Peterhouse) and Mgr Mark Langham (1979, now Roman Catholic Chaplain to the University). Donations from Chapel collections went to Jimmy's Night Shelter, the Cambridge Foodbank, and Christian Aid, while the Remembrance Sunday collection was given to the Soldiers', Sailors', and Airmen's Families Association, and the Commemoration of Benefactors' collection to the College Student Hardship Fund. CHOIR REPORT .The year began with Mr Jonathan Bielby MBE standing in for Mr Hellyer Jones who was on sick leave for the Michaelmas Term. There was a happy coincidence of Mr Bielby having retired in 2010 from his position as Director of Music at Wakeeld Cathedral, where he had latterly been the most senior50Cathedral Organist in the UK, and being known to Mr Hellyer Jones when Mr Bielby was Organ Student at St John's College in the early 1960s. Mr Bielby's contribution to the musical and social life of the Choir was highly valued in the College. There have been several Choral Evensongs outside College: in Norwich Cathedral in November, in Wymondham Abbey in February, and a service sung jointly with the choir of Corpus Christi College, in Corpus Chapel, in May. The Choir of Homerton College visited us and joined our choir in singing Evensong in November. In March, Raphael Colman conducted a liturgical performance of JS Herr, zu dir (BWV 131) with instrumental support. In late June, after Graduation, the Choir made a tour to Belgium. Ghent was the base and concerts were given in Sint-Baafs Cathedral in Ghent and Brussels Cathedral. The Choir sung at Mass in St Pauluskerk in Ghent.

Last summer, water was found below the floor when central heating was being installed in Mallory Court B. Further investigation uncovered a large well beneath the cloakroom, the lower bricks of which were eighteenth-century - from which clear water was flowing into a culvert. This seems to relate to a stream or navigable channel ('the Cambridge watercourse') which once continued until emptying into the Cam about half-way down the Fellows' Garden, but which was believed to have silted up and been lled in with rubble by about 1300. A new underground channel has now been cut for it behind Mallory Court, taking the excess water into the Bin Brook (near the Lutyens Building), where it continues to flow merrily. Less unexpectedly the new Kitchens is a major project brought to a successfulconclusion on schedule and on budget. Together with the Buttery, this involves a surprisingly large area, the footprint of which has not had to be enlarged. The David Roberts building of 1968 has however been raised in height to accommo- date modern facilities. The genius of Roberts's design has been maintained and enlivened: the modest brick structure provides a clever architectural bracket between First Court and Bright's Building, and still allows a glimpse of the Pepys Building from the street. The River Court carriageway in red brick (1985) has been replaced by cobbles. Also as part of the project, Hall seating has been upgraded, the benches (not inelegant, about 1911 in date) being replaced by designer-chairs of traditional character. The appearance of First Court has been enhanced to stunning effect by conserving, repainting and gilding of the heraldic arms and the shields above the doorways (designed by Kruger Gray, 1928). Next to Cripps Court, No 7 Chesterton Road (early Victorian) has been renovated, and the front gardens of Nos 5-11 have been unied by re-landscaping, nished off with railings above a low brick parapet. 52THE GARDENS . In First Court we have recently aimed to have a completely different design of bedding every year. This year, we had a formal Edwardian-style layout with a handful of poppies scattered through it to commemorate those who lost their lives in the First World War. The Second Court herbaceous borders, new last year, have been added to, refreshed, lled out and are now looking superb with the 'cold' and 'hot' sides adding interest to this court. A condition survey of all the trees in College by an experienced arborist in autumn 2013 brought to light a number of serious problems with several of the mature trees, resulting in their removal. In the Scholars' Garden a sycamore was found to be structurally unsafe and a willow erupted with Honey Fungus, while in the Fellows' Garden the three Lombardy poplars were found to have Kretzschmaria deusta (syn. Ustulina deusta), a particularly dangerous soft-rotting fungus. Also, sadly one of the walnuts in the Fellows' Garden fell over in the very wet winter. At Cripps Court the three Cupressus sempervirens had become too large and started to fall over so had to be removed In River Court, the grass embankment was re-aligned; four cherry trees were removed in December 2013 as they were reaching the end of their lives, and were replaced with Amelanchier'Robin Hill'. The Acer cappadocicum on the bank near the bridge had to be removed as it was dying of verticilliumwilt, a fungal disease. The gardeners planted trained fruit trees, ivy (to be trained into a diamond pattern) and herbs (with advice from the College chefs) in the new beds around the rebuilt kitchen. The bed in River Court next Bright's Building was also replanted for a white and blue theme with spots of yellow. Second Court: 'cold' (right) and 'hot' sides (above)53Dr Patel (the Garden Steward): ceremonial planting of the new Amelanchier trees in River Court The area behind the Pepys Building in the Fellows' Garden has been improved. As we imagine the Pepys Building to be the 'house' in the English landscape of the Fellows' Garden, we felt it was important to have the look and feel of a shrubbery that Humphrey Repton might be familiar with, although some of the plants are new such as Mahonia'Soft Caress'. The path all along the building was re-made with the same plastic honeycomb and gravel that was used by the riverside, with a generous space for a bench. It is hoped that this area will become a focal point for this part of the garden. At the same time as doing this work we removed the old roses from the bed at the side of the Pepys Building, pruned the shrubs under the splendidYew tree, and grass-seeded the area to make a more suitable setting for the Yew tree and an area that could be used to serve refreshments. C C S Photos: Colm Sheppard 54VIII COLLEGE STAFF The most important changes in stafng during the year 2013-14 occurred in the Libraries department, where a complete restructuring followed the departure of Phillipa Grimstone in January, after six years as Sub-Librarian. The duties of that ofce have now been divided in a way which better reflects the increased specialisation of responsibilities. Mrs Annie Gleeson became Deputy Librarian (College Library), Miss Catherine Sutherland Deputy Librarian (Pepys Library and Special Collections, including the Old Library and the Archives), with Miss Sophie Connor as part-time Libraries Assistant and Invigilator. Beccie Hunt has left the Domestic Ofce after nine years in charge; her kindness and helpfulness will be missed by all. Tony Fusco, who for 27 years cleaned our public rooms, left us to enjoy a fuller retirement; always the cheerful Italian, he entered with wry amusement into the English obsession with the weather, while keeping us closely informed as to the possible presence of ghosts in the inner recesses of First Court. Colm Sheppard resigned as Head Gardener in order to work for Madingley Hall; although here just under three years, these saw welcome improvements in the Gardens, thanks to the able and dedicated team he put together; we were delighted that one of them, Mark Scott, has been promoted to Head Gardener, seeing off all competition for the widely-advertised post. In the Porters' Lodge, Mike Flanagan resigned as Deputy College Marshal, and Tony Norris retired. John Cotton left his post as Conference and Events Porter in Cripps Court. Among other changes, Sarah Reynolds joined the Alumni and Development Ofce as an Assistant (part-time). Jo Hornsby, veteran of many years as secretary to the Master and President, becomes the Master's PA, while Louise Foster has been appointed (part-time) to look after the President's business and the Fellowship more generally. Two members of staff went on maternity leave: Jenny Woodhead, Human Resources Manager, and Andrea Hoskins of the Gardens Department. We said goodbye to Seb Matusik, who is returning to Poland after eight years' service in the Buttery. On Saturday 28 June a cream afternoon tea was held in Cripps Court organised by the Staff Social Club. Attended by many past and present members of Staff, the idea was to honour the memory of Brian Deakin who was a generous friend and supporter of Staff social occasions. We were delighted to welcome as guests Mrs Deakin and his son and daughter, as well as a number of Fellows.55IX EVENTS AND COMMEMORATIONS 25THANNIVERSARY OFTHEADMISSION OFWOMEN . On Saturday 9 November 2013 a Dinner was held in Hall to celebrate the anniversary of the admission of women to Magdalene. The celebration started in the late afternoon with a panel discussion in the Sir Humphrey Cripps Theatre, 'Women pioneers of Magdalene', chaired by Professor Cooper, and featuring Ms Kate James, Ms Lateh Dubash, Judge Kyrie James, and Ms Katie Derham (all Baroness Kennedy, QC, FRSA, gave the after-dinner speech. PARNELL LECTURE .This year's Parnell lecture was given by Professor Clair Wills in the Sir Humphrey Cripps Theatre on 25 February 2014. Her title was Late Irish Style: contemporary Irish poetry and the problem of belatedness . SEAMUS HEANEY : A COMMEMORATION AND CELEBRATION .Magdalene celebrated Heaney's writing and association with the College on 5 March 2014. Roy Foster, Carroll Professor of Irish History at Oxford and the biographer of W B Yeats, launched the day with a magisterial lecture on 'Seamus Heaney in his times', in which he developed the parallels and contrasts with Yeats. A panel of distinguished critics, which included two former Parnell Fellows, Professors Declan Kiberd and Edna Longley, reflected on key aspects of Heaney's work. A group of poets - the Master, taking the chair but also in his own right as a poet, Bernard O'Donoghue, Leontia Flynn, Don Paterson, and Heaney's life-long friend and colleague, Michael Longley - each introduced and read from Heaney's work. The day ended with a round-table discussion, rendered especially memorable by Michael Longley's affectionately hilarious reminiscences. During the proceedings, a recently-acquired charcoal portrait of Heaney by the painter Peter Edwards was unveiled (see p 11). The quality of all the contributions, and the participation of Seamus's widow Marie and their daughter Catherine, made for an unforgettable occasion. SOUTHWOLD READING PARTY FOR HISTORIANS . In late March the Historians' Reading Week relocated from its former venue in Clay, to the College's spacious and luxurious modern house in Southwold, Suffolk, the municent gift of our Honorary Fellow, Robert Cripps. A party of undergraduates (historians and one theologian) was led by Professor Duffy and Dr Atkins, their wives, and supervised by the red border collies Molly and Jess. Studious silence prevailed in the mornings and late afternoons, as members of the group toiled on topics ranging from the medieval world cult of St Foi to the British social housing policy between the World Wars. Study was relieved by invigorating walks on the beaches, marshes and reed- beds of Southwold and Walberswick, for which the sun shone obligingly. Trips56further aeld included a church-crawl to the fascinating neighbouring Blythburgh, Westhall, Wenhaston and Brameld, where Mrs Duffy and Mrs Atkins shed a sisterly tear over the 18th-century grave of Bridget Applewaithe who, as her tombstone informed them, endured'the Fatigues of a Married Life, Born by her with Incredible Patience, For four Years and three Quarters, bating [less] three weeks'. Sadly, an expedition to Orford found the Castle locked and barred against us: but the party consoled themselves with a visit to the splendid parish church, scene of the rst performance of Britten's Noye's Fludde, The Burning Fiery Furnace, and Curlew River, where Dr Atkins played the organ while Professor Duffy sang. After dinner each evening the College's merciless version of Hearts was played, stories by M R James and Arthur Conan Doyle read aloud, and the week was rounded off with a sh supper from the excellent chippy two doors along from George Orwell's house, followed by an evening of Adnams in the snug of the Admiral Nelson. Other subject-groups are urged to take advantage of this marvellous new College facility, and the congenial setting it provides for work, friendship, and relaxation. MAGDALENE TRIENNIAL FESTIVAL 2014-15: SOUND. The College is delighted to announce that the fourth Magdalene Festival takes place from October 2014 to June 2015. Following on from the previous themes, Literature, Landscape, and The Image, the topic of Soundhas been chosen. We draw on expertise both from within the College and from the wider international academic community to present a programme of lectures, symposia and performances. Members of the College and their guests are very welcome to attend events, which take place on most Thursdays of Full Term (Michaelmas and Lent Terms) at 5.00 pm, in the Sir Humphrey Cripps Theatre and are followed by receptions in the Denis Murphy Gallery; there are afternoon events on certain Saturdays as well. Details are available on www.magd.cam.ac.uk or from the Festival Directors, Dr Jane Hughes and Ms Silke Mentchen, litfest@magd.cam.ac.uk.

Nigel Groom (1942). Nigel St John Groom, OBE, came up to Magdalene from Haileybury. He left after one year (with a 2.1 in History Prelims) to join the Indian Army (3 Gurkha Rifles) in 1943. After the War he entered the Colonial Service; posted to the Western Aden Protectorate, a murderously dangerous region, in 1950 he fended off a tribal assassination attempt. He rose to become Assistant Chief Secretary. After a brief tour of duty in Kenya, he was recruited as an ofcer in MI5 in 1962. An early success was uncovering a KGB spy, Warrant Ofcer Douglas Britten, embedded in the RAF. He became one of MI5's most senior and experienced counter-espionage ofcers, with an unrivalled knowledge of the sophisticated techniques employed by the USSR. Many of the major spy cases of the 1960s and 1970s passed through his hands. He investigated the allegations of Peter Wright that Sir Roger Hollis, the Service former Director-General, had been a Soviet mole, concluding that the evidence was at best inconclusive. Groom never lost his interest in the Arab world, especially its pre-Islamic history and archaeology. Apart from many scholarly papers, he compiled A dictionary of Arabic topography and place- names(1983). He was also an expert on Arab scents and perfumes, about which he published handbooks, and in Frankincense and Myrrh (1981) explained not only the growth of the trade, but the association with Christ's divinity. He died aged 89 in March 2014. Stephen Sebag-Monteore (1944). Stephen Eric Sebag-Monteore read Natural Sciences for Medicine, gaining a second class degree in his BA (1947) and obtaining his MB, BChir qualication in 1950. His intelligence as a student was not matched by ease of expression, but he soon gained a reputation as a Kensington GP both conscientious and trustworthy. After training as psychotherapist, he built up a fashionable clientele, including Peter Sellers, Dudley Moore, and Peter Cook,60who satirised his sweet and gentle manner in a sketch for their 1965 television series. Monteore was a scion of haut juiverie, the son of an almost archetypical British army ofcer. He himself had four high-achieving sons, two of them at Magdalene. He died aged 87 in June 2014. Leslie Jaeger (1959). Leslie Gordon Jaeger, CM, DSc, a graduate of Gonville and Caius, was a Fellow of Magdalene and Director of Studies in Engineering, 1959-1963, and a most lively and fertile presence among a small and predomi- nantly elderly Fellowship. Before becoming Regius Professor of Engineering at Edinburgh, he specialised in advance structural analysis, especially bridge engi- neering. He emigrated to Canada as Professor of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics at McGill University, the rst of several leading Canadian appoint- ments. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His pre-eminence in Canadian engineering was recognised by his election as a Member of the Order of Canada (2002). He died aged 87 in August 2013. Development Director's Report The Magdalene community has continued to respond to the challenges the College faces in this brave new world of diminished public funding for Higher Education by giving more and giving more often. We raised just less than \u00a32,400,000 in cash and pledges this nancial year - a wonderful testament to the unceasing support of our Members and Friends. A $2 million (\u00a31,173,500) gift from an anonymous donor established a Fund for History and Economics at Magdalene to our Centre for History & Economics. This means that almost half the funds raised this year have been for 'Teaching and Research'; although if we exclude the anonymous gift, more than half of donations received were for Student Support, either for the Student Hardship Fund or for Bursaries & Scholarships. We have again been successful in nding donors to undertake to support the funding of individual undergraduates for the duration of their courses. We now have a total of 28 students receiving signicant named bursaries worth up to \u00a34,500 per year on top of a government grant of \u00a33,250, enabling them to cover their living costs for the past academical year in full, thereby mitigating the large debts they will face on graduation. The rst bursary in honour of the former Master and his wife, the 'Duncan and Lisa Robinson Bursary', worth \u00a34,500 per annum, was awarded for the rst time in Michaelmas 2013. In addition, dozens more students receive nancial assistance on a sliding scale which means that we are able to award over 70 undergraduate bursaries (out of a total undergraduate population of around 315), year on year, to help alleviate nancial difculties. Indeed, every one of our students in need of nancial support receives help, often generous help, which we are able to provide thanks to our Members and Friends. 61The difference this generous continued support makes is best summed up in the words of one of our students receiving a full undergraduate bursary: 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank my patron and all those who gener- ously give to the bursary scheme. Coming from a relatively humble background and a one parent family, I was very worried about the costs of university, especially in a university such as Cambridge.... indeed, money became one of my biggest concerns upon arrival. ...The necessary purchase of books, gown and a laptop... caused a large amount of stress for not just myself but my family also. However(when) I received a letter outlining the unbelievable generosity of the bursary scheme and my specic patron my nancial situation changed dramatically from a worried state of micromanaging expenses and overdrafts to one which removed all cause for such concern and allowed me to fully enjoy my course and worry about the more pressing issues of a student - namely exams! The Annual Fund has grown to just over \u00a3220,000 and the annual telethon continues to play its part in that success story. Once again our student callers did an exceptional job representing the College and the response from Members has been excellent. As I write, over \u00a3203,000 has been received in response to a fortnight's calling in March this year. Two of our Members, Edward Benthall (1981) and William Salomon (1975), to whom we are most grateful, hosted small dinners at their respective homes to raise funds for the College. Indeed, so many of you responded to our appeals this year that we have reached a new high in terms of participation as over 18% of our Members made a gift to Magdalene this year - thank you. A special Alumni Rugby Dinner was held in College to mark the occasion of Magdalene students Will Briggs' (2009, Medical Sciences) election to Captain, and Frank Sanders' (2009, Medical Sciences) election to Secretary of the CURUFC. The Annual Donors' Day in September included afternoon lectures by Professor Raven (Thomas Lord Audley, refounder of Magdalene), and Dr Skinner (Climate change by creeps and by jerks), followed by a keynote speech by the Master - C S Lewis 50 years on. The Buckingham Society luncheon for Members of our legacy club, was well attended and offered a choice of afternoon activities, including a tour of the Old Library, led by Dr Jane Hughes, featuring an exhibition from the Archives: The College and the Great War, arranged by Dr Hyam; or a talk by Bamber Gascoigne (1955) entitled Driving to India in 1969 in search of the Great Moghuls. Family Day attracted generations of Magdalene Members and guests, despite the Great British Weather not playing ball and torrential rain forcing a last minute move from the Fellows' Garden indoors to Cripps Court. Those attending enjoyed a range of entertainments, including a jazz band, balloon artist, face-painters, and our 'Code-Breakers Challenge' quiz. Dr Hughes also led three well attended tours of the Pepys Library, looking at Samuel Pepys and the Great Fire of London. A 'Magdalene in the City' (MiC) drinks party at Close Brothers kindly hosted by Preben Prebenson (1975) attracted around 100 Members and 17 current under- graduates who were able to attend thanks to coach transport provided by the62generosity of MiC members. The Magdalene Law Association (MLA) continues to forge ahead with the guidance of its Honorary President, Sir Christopher Greenwood, and Chairman, Mark Parker (1979), Vice-Chairman, Paul Stibbard (1966), the Secretary, Katharina Stanford (2000) and Treasurer, Emma Khoo (2001). The MLA annual dinner was held in College and a summer drinks party at Hogan Lovells, courtesy of Joseph Banister (1981). The rst Choir Carol Concert was held in St Matthew's Westminster for Members and their guests. This was a most popular event which sold out and we are most grateful to the College Choir and the Director of Music for undertaking this. We visited Boston, Washington DC and New York and are indebted to Alistair Adam (1980), Frank Crantz (1969) and Robert Chartener (1982), recently elected as a Fellow-Commoner in recognition of his outstanding assistance to the College as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Magdalene College Foundation (MCF). He and his fellow Directors, Geoffrey Craddock (1977), Jason Hafler (2004), William Wilson (1982) and Graham Walker (1982) have helped to steer the Foundation, the College's 501(c) 3, a tax-efcient giving vehicle for US tax-payers, through its rst eight months of operation and the results have been most grati- fying. The participation rate in the USA has overtaken every other alumni cohort for the rst time and over 22% of our Members in the USA have made a gift via the MCF - thank you! We also visited Singapore and Hong Kong and warm thanks are due to Henry Pang (1986) and MengHan Kuok (1997) who both continue to do so much for the College in their respective regions. This year a small delegation led by the Master also visited Kuala Lumpur to attend a number of events, among them a wonderful dinner for Magdalene Members hosted by our Honorary Member, HRH Sultan Dr Nazrin Muizzuddin Shah. He was a most generous host and his affection for the College was evident in his arranging the dinner to be held by candle-light, reminiscent of Hall. Two-and-a-half thousand Members and their guests attended our events this year and we are most grateful to the Fellows, Members and Friends who give their time, expertise and nancial support to help make our alumni relations programme varied and entertaining. We are, as always humbled by the warm welcome we receive on our travels, evidence indeed of the affection in which the College is held by its Members wherever in the world they may now be. Indeed, the Master and Fellows would like to thank all our Members who remain committed to the Magdalene community and have supported the College so generously over the last year. C D L A complete list of donors who made gifts to the College (1276 between 1 July 2013 and 30 June 2014) will be published in the Annual Donors' Report which will be circulated to all members with the autumn issue of Magdalene Matters.63the college and the great war MAGDALENE 'S'LOST GENERATION ', 1914-1918 Of the hundred undergraduates expected to come into residence in October 1914, barely half turned up. During the course of the next four years it was said that practically the whole College enlisted. Of the schoolboys with awards or places, 45 immediately joined the forces instead of coming up; of these twelve were killed in action. By October 1916 there were only six freshmen admitted, three the following year, six in October 1918. By the Easter Term 1915 there were 29 undergraduates in residence; in the Easter Term 1918 the number had fallen to nine, of whom three were medically unfit for the services, two were Indians, four from Siam - young men stranded in Europe for whom the College provided a refuge. Physically-fit eighteen-year-olds from the UK were simply expected to fight and were unlikely to be very welcome in College. (In the autumn of 1914 the Master, S A Donaldson, had resigned his honorary presidency of Cambridge Town Football Club in protest against its decision to play a full fixture-list, when the men were needed for the army.) Empty College rooms were quickly filled by officers on training courses. Magdalene was still a very small College, with fewer than 200 students passing through it between 1908 and 1913, yet 65 members were killed in action or died of their wounds. The following account, based on reports in the College Magazine during the war years, tells their story. It is an edited extract from a more comprehensive article by Professor Ged Martin (1964, formerly Research Fellow). Devotees of Blackadderwill recall the story of the Trinity tiddlywinks team rushing to the recruiting ofce on King's Parade the day the war broke out. In fact the Germans attacked in the depths of the Long Vacation, but a few students were in residence. The Magdalene Tutor, A S Ramsey, returned on 5 August 1914 from an examiners' meeting in Oxford to discover that three of his tutorial pupils 'had left Cambridge at midnight on their motor-cycles to offer themselves as despatch- riders for service with the expeditionary force.... They did not wait to ask leave or to consult their parents, but just left a message to say that they had gone'. Ramsey saw their gesture as 'signicant of the spirit of the times'. All three joined the Royal Engineers. Two survived the war. T Daish was mentioned in despatches in 1916, and won the Military Cross the following year; J N Perks also served throughout. A product of Rugby School, Roger Paul Hepburn graduated in 1914 with a First in Natural Sciences. After eight months as a despatch-rider on the Western Front, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant - a junior rank with a notoriously high death-rate - and retrained as a signaller. He returned to the front in November 1915 as a brigade signal ofcer, was wounded in February 1916, went back to the trenches, where he was awarded the Military Cross in June 1917, two months before he died of his wounds. Magdalene ofcers made light of the dangers they faced. In November 1914, one gave his initial impressions to the Magazinefrom the trenches near Armenti\u00e8res, 'It's not too bad.... The one I'm in now is known as the \"Death Trap\"'. Mercifully, there was a lull in German shelling. 'I must say that some of their64gunners are infernally good shots.' They were also methodical. 'It is funny that they almost always shell at the same time' - around 10 a.m., again at 12.15, 'always knock off from 12.30 for 1 hour, the luncheon interval'. The Germans trenches were only 300 yards away, 'and one can easily see them shovelling the dirt out. Occasionally they put a head up and we have a shot. They sometimes signal misses with their shovels. It's a bit parky at night...'. Roger Paul Hepburn, 1893-1917 The rst College fatality came on 20 October. Meyricke Entwisle Lloyd was an Etonian who had spent a year in Magdalene in 1898-99, before joining the exodus of undergraduates to the South African War. The Magazineplaced him in Northamptonshire, but the family came from Montgomeryshire. Lloyd had remained in the Regular Army after the South African War, and was promoted to Captain in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. Lloyd would be the rst in a death-toll that would eventually reach 65, although the grim total was slightly inflated by including twelve young men who had been admitted to the College but had enlisted before they came into residence. The death-toll was roughly equivalent to wiping out two matriculation years in the period between 1909 and 1913, or four years from the 1890s. The war claimed victims from relatively distant cohorts. Robert Harvey had graduated as far back as 1894, and had founded an elite private school in Victoria, British Columbia in 1901. In his early forties when war broke out, he might have honourably left the ghting to younger men. He was captured during the second battle of Ypres in April 1915, and died soon after of wounds in a German prison camp. From an even earlier intake was George Williams, who came to Magdalene from King Edward VI Grammar School, Birmingham in 1875. With an Honours degree and fteen years' experience as secretary of the Ranelagh 65Club, the largest polo club in the world, he secured an appointment on the General Staff and died, the College's last ofcial war victim, during the influenza epidemic in January 1919. 'He always spoke affectionately of his old College.' Around 350 members of the College took part in the War in some form or other, not all of them in a military capacity - equal to the entire number of matricu - lations between 1895 and 1913. Unfortunately, it is difcult to build up an overall picture of social background and educational achievement. The Magazine'sshort tributes to the fallen were inconsistent in the biographical information supplied, although enough was conveyed to give colour to the 'lost generation' theory, the haunting sense that the brightest and best were sacriced. Godfrey Bull, who was killed at the Dardanelles, had joined an engineering works in Manchester after Cambridge. 'He was making very satisfactory progress in his profession,' a friend wrote, 'and was one of the very many whom England can ill afford to lose.' While it is possible to construct some impressionistic overall picture of those who died, the absence of biographical information makes it harder to know whether they stood out among their contemporaries - perhaps the victims of their own dash and brilliance. The cox and three members of the 1914 May Boat were killed, and a fourth was wounded. However, rowing was a minority interest in Magdalene, and it would be unsafe to draw deductions from this record, however tragic. Godfrey J O Bull, 1890-1915 The list of those serving in the war was also eclectic in its denition of service, for instance including two former members who worked with the YMCA. 'Somewhere in Flanders' was a YMCA centre called, with the permission of the Master, 'Magdalene'. Located in a cellar - everything above ground in the village 66had been destroyed - 'Magdalene' provided free hot cocoa, a warm re and reading matter. Second Lieutenant Arthur S Macpherson of the Labour Corps appealed for novels, cheap editions of the classics and magazines. Also included in the list was I A Richards, later one of the College's most notable intellectuals, who had suffered from tuberculosis, but was included thanks to his service in the Inquiry Bureau at a military hospital - an episode omitted from standard accounts of his life. B Winnington Hill ('Guy'), 1892-1917 Kenneth F Watson, 1893-1915 Given the popular perception that ghter pilots were young public school heroes, it seems remarkable that Magdalene produced only a handful of airmen. Yorkshireman Kenneth Watson read for the Diploma in Agriculture, and was tipped to get his Rugby Blue in the Michaelmas Term of 1914. Instead he joined the Royal Naval Air Service, and was lost at sea on patrol in August 1915. Beresford Winnington Hill, known as 'Guy', was a Classics Scholar who was a member of the University's Ofcers' Training Corps (OTC) throughout his three years in Cambridge. This secured him a commission in the Rifle Brigade at the outbreak of war, but he switched to the Royal Flying Corps after being wounded in the trenches. Life expectancy for pilots was short: posted to the front in February 1917, Hill was killed on 4 March. The news shattered his closest friend, who had rowed in the same boat and sat in the same examination rooms. 'For the past ve days I have been trying to realise that he is dead, and even now I can hardly bear to think of it.... There never was such a fellow as Guy, and what we're going to do without him I don't know.' 67The Royal Air Force was consolidated as a separate service in April 1918, when the War had seven months to run. With a high proportion of its personnel providing technical support behind the lines, it was perhaps likely to have a lower casualty rate. Only two of the eighteen members of the College then listed with the RAF lost their lives. An Exhibitioner in Classics, Harold Winton joined the Middlesex Regiment in September 1914, later transferring to the Royal Flying Corps. He was sent to the front as a pilot on 6 April 1918, and was killed in an accident fteen days later. A Scholar in Mathematics who had come up in 1912, A C Sotheron-Estcourt had won the Military Cross with the Gloucestershire Regiment before training as a pilot. He died in August 1918. Among the survivors were Francis Turner (later Pepys Librarian, Tutor and President), and the two Magdalene men who would command the Allied air forces in the invasion of Normandy in 1944, Trafford Leigh-Mallory and Arthur Tedder. Both were decorated, Leigh-Mallory winning the DSO and Tedder receiving an Italian medal. They became career flyers: in 1919, the Magazine welcomed the news of Tedder's posting to a Cambridge-based RAF unit, noting that he looked 'more like a General than anything we have seen for some weeks'. He would crown his long career as Marshal of the Royal Air Force, GCB, and by serving as Chancellor of the University. This sample of Magdalene airmen is small, but it may be worth noting that they came from the second-rank of independent schools: Hill from Malvern, Watson from Sedburgh and Leigh-Mallory from Haileybury. Sotheron-Estcourthad attended Gresham's Holt, a small but highly regarded Norfolk boarding school. Shrewsbury, which educated Winton, was a foundation with traditional links to Magdalene but lacking the prestige of Eton, Harrow or Winchester. Tedder came from Whitgift in South London, which was ofcially styled a grammar school in his time. Of the four airmen who were killed, two were Scholars and one an Exhibitioner. In 1914, Leigh-Mallory was planning to read for the Bar, while Tedder's dissertation had just won the University's Prince Consort Prize, probably the rst formal piece of post-graduate work in History to come out of Magdalene. Only around a dozen Magdalene men served in the Royal Navy, mostly RNVR who seem to have acted in a training role, plus a couple of chaplains. It seems unlikely that more than a handful of members of the College actually went to sea, although one RNVR lieutenant, J L P Lambe, in residence from 1913 to 1915, was twice torpedoed. Overwhelmingly, members of Magdalene served in the Army. Although some had been members of the OTC during their time at Cambridge, it goes without saying that few had seriously contemplated ghting in a war. At least ve of those killed in action had planned careers in the Anglican Church. George Nash, a History Scholar from Repton, was already preparing for ordination at Cuddesdon when War broke out: he was killed in June 1915. John Morris, who graduated in 1914, had planned to enter another theological college, Wells, but he accepted the 'unpalatable' advice of a friend that it was his duty to ght. He was killed at Suvla Bay, Dardanelles in August 1915: 'he would have made an excellent parish priest'. Arthur Kelk, from Leeds Grammar School, had paved68the way to ordination by taking a Third in the Theological Tripos in 1914. He received a commission from a 'pals' battalion, won the Military Cross, and was killed in 1917. Some could probably have avoided the trenches. Charles Watson was dangerously ill when war broke out, but secured a commission in 1915, and won the Military Cross. Harrovian Robert Williams refused to allow a heart defect to keep him out of the Grenadier Guards. Both lost their lives. George Nash, 1890-1915 Charles Beaumont Watson, 1894-1918 As Cambridge men, they were regarded as natural ofcer material. A few seem to have enlisted as privates but were quickly promoted. A rare exception was James Harter, an Etonian whose ve years in the school OTC would have guaranteed him a commission. However, he enlisted in September 1914, insisting that 'he must learn his work before he took the responsibility'. He remained in the ranks for nearly two years before being commissioned as a second lieutenant, and died leading an attack on a Turkish position in November 1917. The colonies were perhaps more socially democratic - Magdalene had a corporal in the Australian Army Medical Corps, a private in the Rhodesia Regiment, and a Trooper with the New Zealanders - but most of the handful who served in the overseas Empire were European ofcers commanding non-white troops - in India, Burma, Singapore and the King's African Rifles. Just thirteen members of the College held commissions in the elite Guards' regiments - compared with fourteen who were ofcers in the Royal Engineers, conventionally thought of as the brains of the Army. Guardsman Tom Musgrave, a 'youthful and charming' Etonian, was commissioned after Cambridge in the Irish Guards but went out to Kenya to 69become a pioneer farmer. He returned to his regiment when war broke out and arrived in France on 9 January 1915. Four weeks later, Musgrave out-ran his men as they attacked a German position, and was ring into the enemy trench from a parapet when a shot killed him instantly. 'He was very happy here - perhaps almost too happy to do much work!', remarked the Magazineof this 'simple, lively, and generous' personality, adding 'it is sad to think that we shall never see him here among us again'. Tom Musgrave, 1889-1915 The Magdalene soldiers were generally captains, rst and second lieutenants - the junior ofcers who led troops into action and paid the price for their heroism. And there can be no doubt that they were brave. No fewer than 47 of them won the Military Cross, three of them twice. There were ve DSOs, Owen Morshead (later Pepys Librarian and Life Fellow) also winning the MC. Francis Turner earned the Distinguished Flying Cross, and survived a plane crash that left him with life- long facial injuries. There were a few decorations awarded from Allied countries - France, Belgium and Italy - and one notable distinction for acts of courage not in the presence of the enemy. Lieutenant Henry Higgs, a 1908 Maths graduate, was an instructor in the use of hand grenades. Nervous ofcers were liable to drop their bombs and, on one occasion, one man accidently jostled his neighbour, jerking the grenade from his grasp. On more than a dozen occasions, Higgs had leapt forward and seized the bomb, which exploded harmlessly after he had thrown it over a parapet. He was awarded the Albert Medal, forerunner of the George Cross, and ended the War a lieutenant-colonel. Naturally, there was some time lag between heroic actions and the gazetting of medals. The family of John Dennis, from Wisbech Grammar School, read the announcement of his Military Cross on the same day in October 1916 that news reached them of his death. By no means every act of gallantry was honoured. Theodore Barlow was a Classics Exhibitioner who led his men into attack on the Somme. Wounded in the leg, he took refuge in a shell hole, 'cheering on his men, when a bullet hit his chest. Still he kept his head above the shell-hole to urge his men on to greater effort; a third wound put him out of action'. His men stormedtheir objective, a German trench, but Barlow died of wounds six days later. James Harter's commanding ofcer offered the consolation that he 'would most certainly have had an MC if he had come out alive' after leading his men in a successful charge against a fortied Turkish position. And the killing continued to the end, despite the modern narratives that portray the Germans as crumbling from August 1918. History Scholar John Macfadyen was a Hertfordshire Scot who became adept at managing the new war-winning weapon, the tank. Facing the German onslaught in March 1918, he kept his tank operating despite two direct hits and, on his own initiative, mounted four attacks in support of infantry. 'His courage and dash were most marked.' His Military Cross was gazetted on 17 July,but he was killed in August. Inevitably, some of the dead inspired more emotional tributes than others. Two perhaps stand out, both from 1915 but for very different men. The loss of Kenneth Watson (see p 66) with the Royal Naval Flying Corps produced perhaps the longest obituary in the Magazine, which concluded: 'Beneath a most attractive exterior lay the nest character, at once serious and engaging, affectionate and strong: when accounts come to be made up and losses reckoned, it may be said that without hesitation that it will be found that there was none of our men whose death will have left a more cruel sense of loss in the hearts of his contemporaries and elders' (ending with a Latin quotation from the Vulgate). Watson would be remembered for his athletic prowess. Leonard Herman Stern, on the other hand, achieved academic distinction and was a particular loss to the Jewish community of London's East End. Son of a rabbi and educated at the middle-class University College School, he came up as a Scholar, also holding the Cambridge Jewish Exhibition. He obtained a First in Classics in 1913 and went on to sit the Historical Tripos the following year. He played Rugby for the College, and was an active participant in its intellectual coterie, the Kingsley Club, as well as university Jewish organisations and the OTC. In Stepney he was manager of the Lads' Club, and a scoutmaster, setting an example by enlisting with a number of his lads in the 13th Battalion of the London Regiment. He later obtained his commission and left for France, where he died after just ve weeks. His commanding ofcer was quoted in the Magazine: 'he met his death leading his men in the true British way... and gave great promise as an ofcer'. 70Leonard Herman Stern, 1891-1915 Memorial in the East London Synagogue. Note 'Garde ta foy' at the top. The College death-roll of 65 represented 1 in 5 of combatants, which was about average for an Oxbridge college, though the national average was 1 in 8. A memorial tablet with all their names inscribed was dedicated in the College Chapel on 11 November 1923. The Master, A C Benson, declared: 'Few of those who are here present have known face to face these brothers of ours; but their names are held in honour, and their memories are dear. We honour them, because, in the words of our old motto, they kept their honour unstained; we love them, because they offered the sacrice of love'.

The events of 1660 were still power- fully present in people's minds. 1660: the end of the Puritan regime, the return of Charles II to the throne of England. Samuel Pepys, showing immense courage and daring for a 27 year old, had thrown his hat in the ring and joined the group who travelled to France to bring back the King. With no copper-bottomed guarantees that either the monarchy or the new personal liberties Charles brought with him would last, Pepys made the most of both of them while he could. As the decade advances, Pepys explores the way of life now permitted to him by the political changes: he organises dancing lessons, plays music, goes to the theatre (occupations frowned on by the Puritanical Commonwealth); and he enjoys good food, beautiful objects and glorious books, with their ne bindings, their distant provenances and their exotic typefaces. Drinking in public evolves to be both a pleasure for Royalist Anglicans of the 1660s like Pepys and a rather useful symbol representing their claim to a middle ground between the recently aban- doned Puritanism of the Commonwealth and what was regarded as the threat of secret conspiracy from the Catholicism of Europe: socialising openly was as key to making this statement as was the consumption of alcohol itself. Few Puritans had, in reality, practised temperance: the water supply was too lthy and infected for people readily to abandon the relative security of ale. But the justication for drinking alcohol in the Commonwealth had been based on criteria of health not of pleasure. Furthermore, with the Restoration, Anglican England took ownership of alcohol as a tool of social, political and economic progress. Wryly, in a ballad collected by Pepys himself and entitled The Loyal Subject (as it is reason) / Drinks good Sack and is free from Treason, drinking is characterised as an antidote to rebellion - a repeat of the Gunpowder plot, which was forged by 'dry-brained traitors', is inconceivable in a world of sack and ale, where the only explosions are toasts to one's comrades:1 See the Squibs, and hear the Bells, We that drink, have no such thoughts The fth day of November, Blind and void of Reason. The Preacher a sad Story tells, We take care to ll our Vaults, And with horror doth remember, With good Wine at every season. How some dry-brained traitors wrought And with many a cheerful Cup, Plots, that would to ruin brought, We blow one another up, Both King and every Member. And that's our onely Treason. 1Pepys Ballads IV/243, cols 1-2) The claim that loyalty lies in drunkenness is only half in jest. In another ballad of the period, The Courtier's Health, we hear that drinking will grow the economy - a perfect way to pay one's taxes.2So 'a pox on the fanatics', who should be forced to drink: 'they shall drink sack amain too, or they shall be chocked.'...'Let no man bawk his wine'. Drinking wine is a contribution of sorts to society; and those opposed to it are not doing their bit.3It is both a cheeky and a true claim for the importance of wine and ale to the economy. The reference to the economy is important. Money was still scarce, and for every acknowledgement in the Diary of luxury and indulgence there are many more to nancial and other worries. Pepys knows that the liberty to enjoy life comes at a price. The Diary is a record of anxiety as well as of pleasure: Pepys has to worry about paying for all his luxuries, about his health and about his servants, about the traumas of the 1660s - the appearance of Dutch ships on the coast of England, the threat of rebellion in Ireland, the plague and the Great Fire of London. Even one of his favourite occupations, drinking, was not without its attendant worries. In June 1663, Pepys recounts a shocking occurrence, with which we can all sympathise.4 2BL Roxburgh 2.88. 3Adam Smyth, ed, in Seventeenth-century England (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2004). 4All references are to Latham and Matthews. Will is Will Hewer, Pepys's secretary, who lodged with him and remained a lifelong friend. Pepys died in Hewer's house in 1703.74Tonight I took occasion with the Vintener's man, who came by my direction to taste again my terce of Claret, to go down to the cellar with him to consult about the drawing of it; and there to my great vexation I nd that the cellar door hath long been kept unlocked and above half my wine drunk. I was deadly mad at it, and examined my people round. But nobody would confess it; but I did examine the boy, and afterwards Will, and told him of his setting up, after we were in bed, with the maids, but as to that business he denies it - which I can remedy, but I shall endeavour to know how it went. Here Pepys uses the word 'terce', to describe the size of barrel in which his wine was kept. The terce or tierce was half a puncheon, a third of a butt, a sixth of a tun or approximately 160 litres. The investment of money in his collection of wine made the loss of half a grievous blow. Theft was not the worst problem to confront a man with a cellar, as Pepys had discovered three years earlier on 20th October 1660: This morning one came to me to advise with me where to make me a window into my cellar in lieu of one which Sir W. Batten had stopped up, and going down into my cellar to look I put my foot into a great heap of turds, by which I nd that Mr. Turners house of ofce is full and comes into my cellar, which doth trouble me; but I shall have it helped. Despite the rather moderate response of feeling 'troubled' by effluent in the cellar, Pepys sets about having his 'cave' restored. As we shall see, his carefully maintained supplies become for him a source of great pride. So what would Pepys have been drinking in the 1660s and what would he have stored in the newly cleansed cellar? The old favourites of the English wereRhenish, a term which really covered most German wine, and Falstaff's tipple, sack. Of these wines, Rhenish was traditionally among the more highly prized, and it was imported in large quantities, especially via Rotterdam. Back in the twelfth century, Henry II had granted the merchants of Cologne the right to sell wine within the walls of their own premises in London. By 1604, Sir Goslin Glowworm in Dekker and Webster's play Westward Hoe could send a message to invite Mistress Honeysuckle to the Rhenish winehouse: 'Will you steal forth, and taste of a Dutch bun, and a keg of sturgeon?' is the appetising offer. 5John Taylor, in his travels through London of 1636, lists foure houses in London that doe sell Rhennish Wine, inhabited only by Dutchmen. Namely: the Stilliyard; the Swan in Thames Street; the Swan in Crooked Lane; The Sun at St Mary's Hill.6 5Act II, scene 2. 6In John H. Chandler, ed, Travels through Stuart Britain: the adventures of John Taylor, the water-poet (Stroud, Gloucester : Sutton Publishers, c 1999). The 'stilliyard' is the Steelyard, off Thames Street.75By the time of the Restoration, there was also an 'old Rhenish Winehouse' some- where in King Street. This appears to have survived until the 1720s, when it features on Strype's plan of the city; it may have been pulled down to make way for the redevelopment around the Guildhall.7This establishment appears in a some- what alarming context in Pepys's Diary of 1667: After dinner away and then to Mrs. Martins, where I met with the good news que esta no con child she having de estos upon her - the fear of which, which she did give me the other day, had troubled me much. My joy in this made me send for wine, and thither came her sister and Mrs. Cragg and I stayed a good while there. But here happened the best instance of a woman's falseness in the world; that her sister Doll, who went for a bottle of wine, did come home all blubbering and swearing against one Captain Vandena, a Dutchman of the Rhenish wine house, that pulled her into a stable by the Dog tavern, and there did tumble her and toss her; calling him all the rogues and toads in the world, when she knows that ella hath suffered me to do anything with her a hundred times. Overlooking the political incorrectness of this passage, scarcely disguised by the cod-Spanish, we have here a sense of life at a time of heightened political and personal tension. Fear of a Dutch invasion had that very day given way to the hope of peace; and the double relief felt by Pepys that war was averted and that his mistress was not pregnant gives a perfect image of the mixture of national fears and local anxieties which underpinned his life. Seven years before the diarist recorded Captain Vandena's improprieties, a Rhenish wine house had been a place of less raw emotion for Pepys: in February 1660 he had taken to 'the Rhenish' for a slap-up lunch his cousin Roger Pepys, a barrister of the Middle Temple, who was about to marry and become MP for Cambridge - a position in which he served from 1661 to 1678, acting also as Recorder in the city:8 we took him out of the Hall to Priors, the Rhenish wine-house, and there had a pint or two of wine and a dish of Anchovies, and bespake three or four dozen of bottles of wine for him against his Wedding. The pint is the standard measurement for wine-drinking in the Diary. There are dozens of references to a 'pint of wine', or (more commonly) a 'pint or two' of wine! Rhenish was not the cheapest wine, but neither was it as pricey as, say, Canary wines. In the 1660s wine were charged at a set rate: the maximum prices charged 7See H P Wheatley and Peter Cunningham, London Past and Present , pp 161-2. The area is described in Strype's Survey of the Cities of London and Westminster (London 1720), Book 6, chapter 5. 8See the entry in The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.76for claret were 6 pence (6d) per pint, Rhenish 9 pence per pint, sack 11 pence per pint, and Canary 12 pence per pint.9 It might be surprising that claret was the cheapest of these wines. In fact French wines, especially reds, had not always been seen as a particularly sophisti- cated drink, and although there was a growing desire for Bordeaux in the higher echelons of society, this fashion was in its infancy. An international Burgundy wine trade was yet to develop fully.10In the section on 'The Red Wines of France' in The Country Farm, by Richard Surflet (1616), red wine is seen as distinctly inferior to the softer, sweeter whites:11 The deep red and vermilion coloured [wines of France] are for the most part harsh and rough, and so the most unpleasant and unwholesome of all other: for that they are wont to be ill concocted and digested, and slowly distributed, as also to engender many obstructions, and beget a gross and melancholic blood. And for these causes they are not convenient except for such as labour and lead a very toilsome life, in whose bodies they being once concocted and digested, do nourish very much, and make them more strong and lusty to go about and nish their work, and therewithal corroborate their stomach. And before we attribute this to the inferior tastes of the ale-swigging English, we should note that Surflet was translating from a French classic, Charles Estienne and Jean Li\u00e9bault's Maison rustique (1597). However, Surflet was writing in the earlyseventeenth century: the 1660s see the beginnings of the modern French wine trade. For the rst time, French producers opened what we would now call marketing suites in London to show off their wares. In 1666, Arnaud de Pontac sent his son to London, where he opened arestaurant, a grocer's shop and a tavern named the Sign of Pontac's Head. Such outlets would be a valuable way of showing the new wines. During the stand-off with the Dutch, imports from Rotterdam were halted and Rhenish was harder to come by; the wine routes from Bordeaux stepped in to supply the need. The style of French wine had changed or at least was changing. And the availability of these new wines was part of a wider picture: Charles II's return from exile in France brought a fascination with the French court, its lifestyle and its tastes. So French wines were growing in popularity. Yet even an aristocratic wine cellar still boasted a wide variety of wines. In 1666 the cellar of Robert Spencer, the Earl of Sutherland, contained 37 bottles of Rhenish wine, two pints of Spanish wine, 9See Tim Unwin, Wine and the Vine: an Historical Geography of Viniculture and the Wine Trade (London: Routledge, 2005), pp 242-3 and Charles Ludington, The Politics of Wine in Britain: a new Cultural History (London: Palgrave, 2013), p 20. 10However, these wines had enjoyed a high prestige back in the fourteenth century when the wine routes from Burgundy and Bordeaux to England were protected and cherished by the English Crown. The wine trade was a major underlying cause of the Hundred Years' War. 11This volume was printed in London by Adam Islip for John Bill, 1616. Cited with modernised spelling. 7738 bottles of mountain (a popular name for a sweet wine from the hills outside Malaga), 41 bottles of Cyprus wine, 22 bottles of Madeira, one bottle of Languedoc, 36 bottles of Champagne, 40 bottles of c\u00f4te r\u00f4tie (that is, Rh\u00f4ne wine), 84 bottles of Burgundy and 191 bottles of claret, along with many more unspecied bottles of white wine, brandies, beer and bitter water.12Of course, some wines in Sutherland's collection were for drinking while others enjoyed a secondary popularity as remedies or pick-me-ups. In particular, the plague of the 1660s, which was at its height in 1665/6, was treated or averted by all sorts of mixtures and confections: white wine with rubbed sage, beer mixed with sack, and the warming favourite burnt claret.13 In microcosm, Pepys's cellar of 1665 reveals the same breadth as Sutherland's: [July] 7. Up, and having set my neighbour Mr. Hudson, wine coopers, at work drawing out a tierce of wine for the sending of some of it to my wife - I abroad, only taking notice to what a condition it hath pleased God to bring me, that at this time I have two tierces of claret - two quarter-casks of canary, and a smaller vessel of sack - a vessel of tent, another of Malaga, and another of white wine, all in my wine cellar together - which, I believe, none of my friends of my name now alive ever had of his own at one time.14 Wine for Pepys is a status symbol, a lifestyle choice if you like, a luxury and (in a city of polluted water supplies) a necessity. Wine is also a gift. There is a tender letter to his father asking him solicitously whether he has sufcient supplies of wine: 'I hope you have had some Wine lately,' writes Pepys in 1677, 'and desire that before your Stocke be out, you would give me notice of it, that I may provide more for you, and whatever else your health or pleasure shall require from hence'.15And wine is a way of storing your wealth in a city without banks: so as the Great Fire advanced towards Seething Lane in 1666, Samuel Pepys rescued his diary and his books; and in the cool earth of his garden he buried his wine.16 When Pepys encounters a new claret, therefore, in 1663, it touches on many different aspects of the history of the Restoration. Pepys gives us an account of the day in 1663 when he called at the Royal Oak Tavern in Lombard Street. This was a medium-sized establishment. Three years later the landlord was William Smith, vintner, and the tavern was assessed as having nine hearths. (There was a tax based on the number of hearths, and this gure is often the best we have for knowing the size of a building).17On April 10th, 1663, Pepys records: 12Ludington, Politics of Wine, p 23. 13Pepys's friend, the more abstemious Evelyn, however, treated his maladies with 'cordum posset' and a hot bath of milk. Cordum is a type of thistle. (Diary of John Evelyn, 7 February 1682). 14'Tent' is a wine from Galicia - the word is a corruption of the descriptive tinto. 15Helen Truesdell Heath, ed., The Letters of Samuel Pepys and His Family Circle (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1955), Letter 54 (20 June 1677), p 53. 16And, famously, he buried his cheese - an expensive, imported parmesan. 17Robert Latham's Companionto the Diary provides a wealth of information regarding taverns and eating houses named by Pepys in his journal.78The Diary entry naming Ho Bryan: following his usual practice, proper names are written in long hand, while the main diary is in shorthand. Up very betimes and to my ofce, where most hard at business alone all the morning. At noon to the Exchange, where I hear that after great expectation from Ireland, and long stop of letters, there is good news come, that all is quiet - after our great noise of troubles there, though some stir hath been as was reported. Off the Exchange with Sir J. Cutler and Mr. Grant to the Royall Oak Taverne, in Lumbard-street, where Alexander Broome the poet was, a merry and witty man I believe, if he be not a little conceited. And here drank a sort of French wine, called Ho Bryan, that hath a good and most perticular taste that I never met with. Home to dinner, and then by water abroad to White-hall. My wife to see Mrs. Ferrers, I to White-hall and the park, doing no business. Then to my Lord's lodgings, met my wife, and walked to the New Exchange; there laid out 10s upon pendents and painted leather-gloves, very pretty and all the mode. So by coach home and to my ofce till late, and so to supper and to bed. Ho Bryan: Ch\u00e2teau Haut Brion. One of the new wines which changed people's view of French reds. It is a wine which was not only served at the Royal Oak Tavern. Charles II's 'livre de cave' reveals that he too had Haut Brion in his cellar.18The signicance of the reference in the Diary is not only that Pepys was discovering a taste for the ner things in life - a new wine to go with the stylish pendants and \u00e0 la modenew gloves bought on the same day. It is also the rst English reference we have to a named claret outside cellar books. The usual generic description of a wine by its country of provenance or its colour gives way to a more rened sense of taste - the possibility of distinguishing one wine from another within the same region. It signals the beginning of fashionable labels and desirable vintages. It is also a symptom of Pepys's wider interest in names: his diary is full of them - names of plays, of the streets he walks along, of the people he meets, of the dishes he eats, of the taverns he visits. This specicity is one of the great appeals of the Diary. Pepys was not the rst or the only person to taste 'Ho Bryan', but his attention to detail provides this unique reference. The appearance of a new claret on the capital's scene indicates something else, too. As it had been back in the fourteenth century, the importation of Bordeaux wines was increasingly big business. As well as opening outlets in London, merchants would travel to France and try to negotiate a good deal. Pepys recounts one such event, which he hears about in August 1666: 18Preserved in The National Archives, Kew. 79So home and late at the ofce; and then home and there found Mr. Batelier and his sister Mary, and we sat chatting a great while, talking of Wiches and Spirits; and he told me of his own knowledge, being with some others at Bourdeaux, making a bargain with another man at a taverne for some Claretts, they did hire a fellow to thunder (which he had the art of doing upon a deale board) and to rain and hail; that is, make the noise of - so as did give them an pretence for undervaluing their Merchants wines, by saying this thunder would spoil and turn them - which was so reasonable to the Merchant, that he did abate two pistollsper Ton for the wine, in belief of that - whereas, going out, there was no such thing. Why the seller didn't realise that the storm was merely a fellow with a thunder board it is hard to guess: perhaps there had been a little too much sampling of the wares. But such amusing stories of deals and prices were the very stuff of conversation in the Pepys household. His eye for nery was matched only by his eye for a bargain. Sadly, we have to go back some way to nd Haut Brion in the wine cellar of Magdalene. All the way to the Fellows'Annual Pepys Dinner of 1932. A vogue was current in Magdalene in the late 20s and early 30s - to have food and wine served which Pepys mentions in his journal. So - before they were entertained by a rendering of Pepys's own song, 'Beauty Retire' given by a young English and Modern Languages student named Michael Redgrave - the diners and their guests in 1932 sat down to a 'pie of such pleasant variety of good things as in all my life I never tasted' (a dish inspired by the diary entry of November 14th 1661) washed down by 'plenty of brave wine, and above all Bristol Milk' and, delightfully, a ne claret: none other than Ho Bryan.19 M E J H The Haut Brion entry in the Cellar Book of Charles II, reproduced by kind permission of The National Archives, Kew. 19Bristol Milk was a thick rum punch, developing by the late nineteenth century into a dark sherry. Macaulay reports a ne dining experience in his History of England: 'The repast was dressed in the furnace, and was accompanied by a rich brewage made of the best Spanish wine, and celebrated over the whole kingdom as Bristol milk.' The Haut Brion in 1932 was a La Mission, which was at that time a rival to the original chateau, though now the two labels are controlled by a single rm.80reading the seventeenth century AN OLD LIBRARY COMMONPLACE -BOOK Miscellaneous notes on the damaged flyleaf of Old Library MS F.4.21 The commonplace-books habitually kept by learned and semi-learned men in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries provide a rich body of evidence for the intellectual culture of the period, ne-grained in its particular detail but attesting to the larger structures of knowledge and methods of learning and inquiry on which that culture depended. Recommended by humanist teachers since the fteenth century, the keeping of such notebooks enabled one to record and organise useful details encountered in the process of reading. Despite the essential similarity of the instructions which numerous pedagogues gave for the compilation of such books, the many hundreds of examples that survive from early modern England are quite varied in their structure and content. Some are stubbornly miscellaneous accumulations of material added as the compiler came across it in his reading; others contain quotations dutifully entered under predetermined headings, arranged either alphabetically or conceptually. A middle way between these extremes was to enter material as one encountered it, while maintaining a cumulative alphabetical index at the back of the book. Each commonplace-book is both a record of an individual's private study and a window into the world of learning which he was trying to grasp. 81One such book is found in Magdalene's Old Library (MS F.4.21). This small leather-bound notebook is lled with hundreds of neatly written extracts from numerous printed works, most of which date from 1620-1645. There is a partial alphabetical index. Many of the extracts are unattributed, but it has proved possible to determine the source-texts for most entries. The volume is distinctive for the coherent, well-dened conceptual focus of its contents. Two authors dominate the book: Thomas Jackson (1578-1640), President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and Dean of Peterborough, well known as a Neo-Platonist and an Arminian; and Francis Bacon (1561-1626). The theologian and the reformer of natural philosophy may seem an unlikely pairing, but the compiler of the commonplace-book sees, or seeks, similar things in both writers: Jackson and Bacon are read as students of the power, extent and fallibility of human reason. From an apparently jumbled collection of reading notes emerges a fairly coherent set of attitudes and preoccupations; more importantly, the book bears witness to the potential coherence of mid-seventeenth-century culture itself, belying any crude narratives about the rise and fall of schools of thought and cutting across modern disciplinary boundaries. Theology, natural philosophy, history, ction and political tracts are read alongside each other, furnishing the materials for a complex but essentially consistent vision of human experience. The very rst extract in the book is taken from the second edition of Thomas Jackson's Justifying Faith (1631), and offers a word of caution against the dangers of pride in human knowledge and reason: To be able to sound the depth of many Conclusions better than others can, gives stayed & setled judgements a more distinct & complete measure of that knowledge they wanted than phantastick or shallow witts can have. For this cause solid learning alwaies contracts, pedanticall knowledge, or superciall skill in any facultie, dilates men's estimates of themselves; & puffs them up with prejudiciall conceits of their own worth. After this warning, there follow eighty-four pages of notes on Jackson's A Treatise Containing the Originall of Unbeliefe, Misbeliefe, or Misperswasions Concerning Attributes of the Deitie (1625). Jackson's book prepares the ground for its theological purpose by offering what is, in effect, a general account of human knowledge: The maine question of all questions, is, how we become certainly perswaded of any truth. This certainty can never be wrought but by a repercussion of the ingraffed notion upon it selfe. Thus in all contemplations fully evident & certaine, we feele a gratefull penetration betweene the object knowne, & the facultie knowing, and as it were a fastening of the truth found, unto that part of the soule, whence the desire of it sprung.82Jackson is keen to anatomise the processes by which human thinking, from the most apparently rational argument to complex matters of volition and affection, can be led astray. In the following passage, for instance, the language of 'faculty psychology', which understood the 'fancy' or 'fantasy' as the part of the mind that processed the images formed by human cognition, is used to describe the growth of sin as a form of narcissism: every predominant humour or Corruption of the heart, delights to have its picture drawne in the braine. The fancie is as a shop of devices to adorne it; and so adorned, it growes mad with love of its owne representation; as Narcissus did with his shadowe. Jackson's sense of the proliferating possibilities for human error does not amount to a position of philosophical scepticism. Some people are able, 'by profundity, or strength of wit [...] to dive into the depth of sciences', generalising and abstracting where appropriate and arriving at rm and proper judgements. Accordingly, the compiler does not only draw on Jackson's warnings about the frailties of human intellect, but on his positive doctrine too: he copies extensively from Jackson's A Treatise of the Divine Essence and Attributes (1628). Students of Francis Bacon will recognise the potential harmonies between Bacon's warnings about the human mind ('an enchanted glass, full of superstition and imposture') and Jackson's circumspection about the use of reason in theology; both writers also argue that despite these difculties one must strive to establish the rm maxims on which solid learning should rest. The compiler copies Bacon's statement in his essay 'Of Inspired Divinity' that 'There is a double excesse in the use of humane Reason in matters Divine', and the following observation from 'Of Truth': It is not onely the Difcultie & Labour, which men take in nding out of Truth; Nor againe, that when it is found, it imposeth upon men's Thoughts; that doth bring Lies in favour: But a naturall, though corrupt Love, of the Lie itselfe. More extensive Baconian extracts are drawn from The Advancement of Learning (1605) and its Latin successor, the De Augmentis Scientiarum (1623). One writer from whom our compiler quotes rather less, but who exemplies the kind of attitude which might synthesise intense religious contemplation and intense scientic experiment, is Thomas Browne. The commonplace-book draws on both his Pseudodoxia Epidemica (1646), a study of commonly held but erroneous beliefs, and his now better-known Religio Medici (1643): Where the Scripture is silent, the Church is my Text; where it speaks, 'tis but my Comment; where there is a joynt silence of both, I borrow not the rules of my Religion from Rome or Geneva, but from the dictates of my own reason.83Browne's careful reflection on the relative claims of different sources of religious teaching, and his sense of the duty that falls on the individual to look for truth within, were probably shared by our compiler, whose theological reading was extensive and not, it would seem, blindly or narrowly dogmatic. He draws on English divines of various hues, from Puritans to Laudians, with plenty of High Calvinists in between: Lancelot Andrewes, William Bedell, Thomas Fuller, Richard Hooker, Jasper Mayne, William Pemble, Robert Sanderson, Herbert Thorndike, William Twisse, John Weemes and Francis White all feature, accompanied by leading continental thinkers, including the notable anglophiles Isaac Casaubon and Hugo Grotius. From White's A Treatise of the Sabbath Day (1635) the compiler copies a critique of Presbyterianism which gives a hint of the compiler's own religious position: these newe men, undervaluing all humane learning, and rejecting, and crying down the testimony, and tradition of the Ancient Catholike Church; have let open a wide doore to Hereticks, & Schismaticks [...]. And if any hereafter will proceed further, and question the Canonicall authority of Saint John's Revelation, or the Acts of the Apostles, &c. I doe not as yet conceive what these Masters (having disannulled all Tradition and authority of the ancient Catholike Church) will be able to plead against them. Our compiler probably leaned towards the theology and policy of Archbishop Laud, without necessarily embracing them wholly; in any case, whatever his theological position, he read widely, in English and Latin, without restricting himself to works by one narrowly dened party. He copies from John Robinson's New Essayes or Observations Divine and Morall (1628) the complaint that 'Disputations in Religion are sometimes necessarie, but alwaies dangerous; drawing the best spirits into the head from the heart, & leaving it either empty of all; or too full of fleshly zeale & passion'. By virtue of its historical moment, perhaps, the commonplace-book cannot help but see religion as embedded in politics, and vice-versa, and understand both as arenas pervaded by error and deceit. It draws on Sir Edwin Sandys's Europae Speculum (1629), an account of the state of continental Christendom with a particular focus on 'policie' in the Roman Catholic Church. The compiler makes several uses of the English translation of Paolo Sarpi's Historie of the Councel of Trent (1620), commenting for instance that 'A more politique Mysterie was never found, than to use Religion to make men insensible'. The compiler makes extensive use of contemporary political literature. The flyleaves of the book contain scribbled references to The Oppressed Man's Oppressions Declared (1647) by the Leveller John Lilburne and to an issue of Mercurius Pragmaticus, a royalist newsletter published by Marchamont Nedham in the late 1640s. The compiler draws from a large number of texts published during the rst phase of the Civil War. Even when dealing with material which is deeply embedded in this dramatic historical moment, however, our compiler attempts to abstract general principles from his reading. From the anonymous 84An Answer to a Seditious Pamphlet, Intituled, Plain English (1643) he draws the following lesson about human credulity: The People's affections, being once betrayed to their weake reasons, doe beleeve they are satised, when indeed they are confounded by multiplicity of words, mistaking plenty of language for proofs, out of inability to examine the premises. From Samuel Butler's A Letter from Mercurius possesse the multitude, it makes them work not like agents, but like instrumentes, and moulds them to a Temper, t to receive impressions, from those in whose wisedomes or Loves they repose themselves. One particularly striking passage is drawn from Thomas Povey's The Moderator Expecting Sudden Peace, or Certaine Ruine (1642): State-Truth is the Brat of Imagination, and never had any reall being: no Government was ever so rened by an Innovating Reformation, but it had defects, or extravagancies; and by the miscarriage of succeeding States-men, quickly setled into as much (though not the same) corruption. In all these instances, the tumult of contemporary politics bears witness to more permanent truths about human society, truths grounded in the same sense of the fallibility of reason and will that we nd in the extracts drawn from works of theology and natural philosophy. Imaginative or ctional writing also plays its part in the work of analysis and synthesis which the volume performs. From Jackson we nd the warning that 'Many young wits nding unusuall refreshing in extemporary exchanges of jests, of pleasant discourse, or in opening some veine of Poetry, are in short time brought to conne themselves to this kind of dyet; contented to be continually fed with froth'. If any kind of poetry is to be allowed, it must be the serious kind, justied by serious reasoning. The compiler nds such an account in Bacon's Advancement of Learning, which argues that ction 'give[s] some shadowe of Satisfaction to the minde of Man in those points, wherein the Nature of things doth deny it' and 'doth raise & erect the Minde, by submitting the shews of things to the desires of the Mind; whereas reason doth buckle & bowe the minde unto the Nature of things'. In a more utilitarian vein we read: In Poets & writers of Histories we may nd painted forth with great life, How affections are kindled & incyted: and how pacied & restrayned: and how againe contained from Act, & further degree: how they disclose themselves, how they worke, how they varye, how they gather & fortie, how they are inwrapped one within another, and how they doe ght & encounter one with another; & other85the like particularities: Amongst the which this last is of speciall use in Morall & Civile matters. Perhaps the most striking use of what we would now deem a 'literary' text comes in the several pages of notes from Sir Philip Sidney's Arcadiaand Defence of Poesy . These important Elizabethan texts were frequently reprinted and very widely known in the seventeenth century; but it is chastening to nd in our commonplace-book very little sense that they were read with much idea of their aesthetic value or integrity. Instead, they are mined for the same kinds of general statement about human nature and political life that the compiler sought and found elsewhere: What assurance can be had of the peoples will or inclination? which having so many circles of imaginations, can hardly be enclosed in one point. Who knowes a people, that knowes not sudden opinion makes them hope, which hope if it be not answered, they fall to hate? choosing & refusing, erecting & overthrowing, according as the presentnesse of any fancy carries them. The compiler is not averse to modifying and even combining the quotations which he copies. He writes, for instance: It is a thing frequent, for men to put hatefull businesse, into good language; andfrom true Common-Places, to fetch downe most false applications. The rst half of this sentence is from Francis Bacon's The Historie of the Raigne of King Henry the Seventh (1622) and the second from Sidney's Arcadia. Old Library MS F.4.21, p 334, with notes from Sidney and others Sidney's warning about the misapplication of commonplaces is appropriate to the book in which it is copied. It often seems that the compiler has made his own kinds of false application: looking for little else but statements about the human tendency to error, he often errs himself, failing to acknowledge the particular qualities and arguments of the texts he encounters. There is reason to 86refrain from such a criticism; but we need rst to understand the purposes for which this book was compiled. A clue comes from the way in which the compiler organises his extracts. Not only is there an index which facilitates access to material relevant to particular themes, but some extracts are followed by intricate cross- references: 'Hooker. but rst, Num.342'. This refers to the compiler's own numbering of the extracts. His injunction to 'reade with' is an instruction for any number of repeated perusals of the book, perusals in which he will not merely browse sequentially but think about connections which exist between its various contents, sometimes sending him back to the books from which those contents originally came. The extracts are not just inert matter, left interminably in storage for some rainy day that never comes; rather, they are there to be used. The book is a tool in the never-nished ethical work of study and reflection. Who, then, was 'the compiler'? He has left no record of his name, but there are brief notes of several events in his life, which help to place the book both temporally and geographically. He mentions several places north of Cambridge, including Huntingdon, Somersham, and Earith. A damaged section of text parish register of Haddenham (between Earith and Ely) records the marriage of Katherine Wynde and William Drury on Thursday 31st October 1644; despite the slight discrepancy, this is probably the event referred to. More excitingly, the compiler records that on Thursday 20th April 1643 he was at Huntingdon in the presence of Oliver Cromwell. He also records the details of the Battle of the Downs, fought off the English coast by Spanish and Dutch forces in 1639, and the dates of the executions of Charles I and Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford. In short, this is the book of a Huntingdonshire man with at least some interest in contemporary affairs; it dates from the late 1640s or early 1650s. Detail from John Speed's map of Huntingdonshire in The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine (1627) 87M R James, in his Descriptive catalogue of the manuscripts in the College Library of Magdalene College Cambridge (1909), speculated that the manuscript may have been the commonplace-book of Simon Gunton (1609-1676), who matriculated at Magdalene in 1627, became a scholar in 1629, graduated BA in 1631 and MA in 1634. Gunton is best known as the pioneering historian of Peterborough Cathedral, which he knew intimately as a native of the town and later as a canon. He gave many manuscripts to his old college, including the f\u00eated Crowland Apocalpyse. The Donors' Book (Old Library MS F.4.33) lists among Gunton's gifts 'His own common Place Book. With an English Bible Refering to it.' (The latter item seems no longer to be in the College's collection.) Gunton is, in some respects, a good candidate for our manuscript's compiler: his family origins are rooted in Peterborough and Ely, and the Huntingdonshire towns mentioned in the book were populated by Guntons who could well have been Simon's kinsmen. However, in attempting to prove or disprove James's speculation, I have encountered one signicant hindrance to a rm identication: the handwriting in the manuscript is not that used by Gunton in the several documents which survivein his hand. The earliest of these which I have seen is an entry in the parish register of Leighton Bromswold in 1657: Gunton spent time there during the Protectorate under the patronage of James and then of Esm\u00e9 Stuart, rst and second Dukes of Richmond, having been deprived of the living of Pytchley in Northamptonshire. Leighton Bromswold barely troubles the modern cartographer, but it looms rather larger in the cultural map of the mid-seventeenth century: it is just ve miles south of Little Gidding, and George Herbert had been its prebendary incumbent in the 1620s. Other documents surviving in Gunton's hand include: his correspondence with John Cosin, Dean of Peterborough under Charles I and Bishop of Durham after the Restoration, about repairs to Peterborough Cathedral in 1660; the parish registers of St John's, Peterborough, where he was vicar from 1660 to 1667, and Fiskerton, Lincolnshire, where he was rector in the years before his death; and his autograph will. His handwriting is consistent in all these documents, and is not that found in MS F.4.21. It is possible that Gunton's handwriting changed over time, or that he employed different hands for different purposes, but this must remain mere speculation and the question of the book's authorship remain unanswered. However, the details of Gunton's life and intellectual interests can be instructively compared with the preoccupations and cast of mind on display in the common- place-book. Like the compiler, Gunton was a moderate high-churchman with wide-ranging interests. Gunton wrote two short theological books, Ortholatreia: or, A Brief Discourse Concerning Bodily Worship (1650), and Gods House, with the Nature, and use Thereof (1657). Both convey a deep sense of the importance of the dignity and propriety of religious observance. Like the compiler of our manuscript, Gunton gives little sense of contentiousness or intolerance. His history of Peterborough Cathedral only once displays anything like spite, when it recounts an accident - understood as 'a nger of divine vengeance' - that befell88Oliver Cromwell when his Parliamentarian troops ransacked the building in 1643. More than anything else, Gunton loved the institution to which he devoted much of his life: that commitment seems for the most part to have trumped any appetite for theological or political contention. Gunton was a learned man with a considerable personal library, valued at \u00a3100 upon his death in 1676 - a signicant proportion of his overall estate of \u00a3282. 14s. 2d. His will records his bequest to his son-in-law Mordecai Hunton of his copies of 'Plutarchs works, the Turkish history, & Heilyns Geography'. His dona- tion of books to Magdalene is not mentioned in the will, suggesting that the gift was made during Gunton's lifetime. Aside from his important manuscript donations, Gunton gave the College his copy of the nine-volume Critici Sacri (1660), a major compilation of Biblical commentaries produced to supplement Brian Walton's London polyglot Bible of 1657. A faint 'S.G.' is visible on the title page of the College's copy. The Benefaction Book of Peterborough Cathedral Library records his gift to that foundation of works by St Ambrose, Franciscus Lucas Brugensis, and John Cosin. Other books bearing Gunton's neat signature can now be found in various institutional libraries or listed in sale catalogues. Theological and historical books owned by Gunton can be found in Durham and Oxford, and the British Library holds his copy of Edward Hellowes' English trans- lation of the Familar Epistles of the Spanish humanist Antonio de Guevara. In 2009 Sotheby's sold a sammelband of three books which Gunton had purchased together: William Biddulph's The Travels of Foure English Men and a Preacher into Africa, Asia, Troy, Bythinia, Thracia, and to the Blacke Sea (1612), John Cartwright's The Preacher's Travels (1611), and Sir Henry Blount's often reprinted A Voyage into the Levant(1638). The overall picture is of a library dominated by heavy-weight theological scholarship but replete with varied works on other subjects - a picture of a clergyman's reading similar to the one painted by MS F.4.21. Blount's Voyage into the Levant neatly returns us to our commonplace-book, since it is the source for one of the unattributed extracts: The Authors of Superstition, when they nd Customes very usefull, knowing that reason sufces not to hold them in practice with the vulgar, they plant them amongst their other Ceremonies, and make them conscientious, which is the only way to put them upon low capacities. The commonplace-book's task was to help its compiler to analyse such customs and discern reason's limitations, to arm him against deception and insinuation, and to inculcate in him the right kinds of conscientious habit. Its work is at once anthropological, sociological, theological, philosophical, and ethical. In nearly 400 neatly written pages it offers us a rich picture of one man's attempts to take the measure of the words and world in which he lived. M H89the fox glacier, new zealand BY KATE FAGIN (1948-2012) Photo: Adam Parker The Fox Glacier in Cripps Court The Fox Glacier was painted after Anthony and Kate Fagin spent a year travelling around the world in 2007-2008 and was featured in The World, their exhibition of paintings, ceramics, film and photography which was shown at the Falmouth Art Gallery shortly before her death in 2012. It was given to the College in memory of the artist by her husband, Anthony Fagin, in 2013. The following are extracts from a conversation between the artist and her sister-in-law Rosemary Boyle in October 2011, which appeared first in the catalogue of her exhibition in 2012. When did you rst want to be an artist? When I was about 16. But life didn't provide the opportunities at that point. You didn't start to study art until you were 50. Were there any outlets for your creativity before then? I didn't have much time, running a house and bringing up four children, one of whom is severely autistic and who lived at home until she was 18. But I studied and practised flower arranging, getting books out of the library to learn the techniques. I also laid out and maintained a large garden. You studied art at University College, Falmouth. How was that? That is where I became an artist, starting out with gurative painting, using acrylics and then moving into abstract painting. I sold work from my student exhibitions, which was very encouraging. However I do think that art schools should teach technique and not simply expect students to nd their own way. 90How would you describe your work now? What subjects do you choose? I mainly use oils laying the paint on thickly to achieve a certain effect. I use about half a dozen different techniques; I also paint with acrylics and use Polylla for texture; and I take photographs, some of which have been exhibited. I would describe myself as an environmental painter. I choose subjects that excite me, often subjects which inspire fear: re, the majesty of nature, the fragility of nature. I haven't painted an avalanche yet but I could see myself being interested in doing that. A key moment in my development was seeing the painting of Gordale Scar by James Ward for the rst time in Tate Britain. I had seen reproductions in books but standing in front of it was something of an awakening, allowing me to begin to understand what it was that excited me. Can you tell me a bit more about why you like that painting so much? Is it the light or the movement or just the grandeur of the subject? It is primarily the grandeur of the subject and the way the light plays between the dark immensity of the tall cliffs and through the dark, threatening sky. It is a huge painting and the viewer feels dominated by it, helpless and insignicant before its formidable and powerful presence, represented by the size and scale of those incredible cliffs. What are the other key influences in your work? It's the nineteenth-century painters, who have provided the inspiration for many painters since then, including me: John Martin's Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrahand Caspar David Friedrich's The Monk by the Sea. And then of course there's Turner. You often use the word sublime when you talk about painting. What does that represent for you? I understand the sublime to be the quality of greatness, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual or artistic. For me it refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurements or imitation. Those nineteenth-century painters were all about striving to nd the sublime in nature. How do you approach a subject - what happens when you paint? I often paint from drawings I have made or photographs. Sadly in our 12-month round the world trip 3 years ago, when I did a lot of drawing, all my drawings were in a rucksack that was stolen in the nal month of the trip. Normally I make a grid and scale up the drawing, perhaps 16 squares for a large painting. But, unless I am trying to be exact, I lay out the work in a flexible way. One of the most important things for me - and not all artists feel like this - is to allow myself to be led by the painting as it emerges. I see things as the painting develops which I hadn't intended and then try to follow the leads I am given. I begin by under-painting a number of coats, painting in the darker shades and leaving the lighter areas. Then I draw in the lines (slopes, or animals, say) not always in very much detail. I then paint each grid in a flexible way.91When you are not painting are you thinking about your work? Yes of course! I often wake up at night and an aspect of the painting that I'm working on comes into my mind, something I am not satised with, and I might have an idea about how to re-tackle it. If I am very dissatised I paint over the picture completely. That can be quite exciting because a dialogue may than emerge between the abandoned painting and the new one and something new again can emerge, different from what I had intended when I started the second picture. Most of your exhibitions have been done jointly with your husband Anthony, the ceramicist and photographer. Your rst major exhibition 'Double Take' was in 2004 in the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society in Falmouth. Tell me about your second exhibition, 'The Creation' in Truro in 2005. Was that the beginning of your journey as an environmental artist? Yes I suppose it was, though I'd had an interest in ecology for a long time. Even in my 20s, back in the 1970s, while I was doing a brief spell nursing, I remember sharing the concern, then beginning to emerge, about pollution and the scarcity of natural resources. But I suppose it was only when I went to Falmouth College in my 50s that I became aware of environmental concerns in a more pressing way. I suppose for the rst time I had time to stop and think and I guess I took up from where I left off in my 20s. Meeting Ant was an important step. He had spent signicant parts of his professional life, prior to becoming a ceramist, working on environmental issues, latterly in a senior position at the global headquarters of the United Nations Environment programme. A meeting of minds as well as hearts? Indeed! How did you light upon The Creation theme for that second exhibition and what work did you produce? The theme emerged because at the time Ant was making large ceramic works. I had just started painting the sea and my work was changing from semi-abstract, mainly using acrylics. I was moving towards oils, influenced by Ant's work, which has a loose and free feel to it. The pictures in that exhibition were more gurative than abstract and were full of light and bright colours. We took those awe- inspiring opening verses of Genesis as our theme. What has changed since then in your work? Are you an incremental developer, stickingto one medium or theme? Or do you just follow your interest and subjects that catch your attention?My work is more fluid, less abstract and more gurative. And at the moment I am painting only in oils. But that is just the current stage and I expect to move into new things. I tend to work with a particular effect in mind for a while, through several paintings and then move on to something else.92You are now working on your second glacier grid. Why did you decide to paint the rst one, Mer de Glace? How did you go about that work? I didn't start out with the idea of a 64-painting installation. I had visited Mer de Glace and was moved by the gradual retreat of the glacier over the last 100 years and particularly by its rapidly increasing rate of retreat over the last 30. I sat and made a large number of sketches, intrigued by the forms, lines and varying shades of white, through grey to brown and black. I began by doing two oil paintings. I then decided to do another two and so on. By the time I had done eight or so, the idea of painting an installation comprising a grid came to me. The requirements of the painting stepped in I suppose. Each of the canvases was conceived as an individual work. But then I began to see, when I hung the rst eight or ten, that themes and movements began to emerge. The individual paintings disclosed a relationship between themselves. At that point I began to follow the lead the paintings were giving me as I became more aware of the possible relationships between the individual canvases I simply went with that inspiration. Of course I am very gratied that Mer de Glace has been on permanent display since 2007 at the global headquarters of the United Nations Environment Programme in Nairobi where it is seen by people responsible for forging international environmental policy. Then I was asked to do a second grid for an exhibition next April. I was inspired this time by the Fox Glacier in New Zealand. Again the forms and lines caught my attention. For this work, however, the colours include more white and a striking, pristine blue that I was able to see from close up as we hiked across the top of the glacier. What next Kate? You are now preparing for your third exhibition in April 2012 at the Falmouth Gallery where some of your photographs and Ant's are already part of their permanent collection. What themes do you want to explore? The theme for the exhibition which is entitled 'The World' is work in several different media (painting, ceramics, lm and photography) inspired by our round the world trip three years ago. It will focus on the natural phenomena and events that we witnessed on our travels such as the great migration, the desert flowering, forest res, glaciers, the Galapagos, Easter Island, the Avenue of Volcanoes in Equador and so on. As much as I have time and energy to cover! The Fox Glacier will be a substantial element in that show. All your exhibitions have been shared with Ant. Can you tell me something about that professional collaboration? How does Ant's work feed into, resonate with your work. How has his interest in and encouragement of your work helped you to develop as a painter? Ant's influence and encouragement have been huge and invaluable to me in my development as an artist. I think we help and encourage one another constantly with our work and rely heavily on each other's opinions throughout our respective processes. Working together for an exhibition is wonderfully exciting and creative. We both love it.93What matters to you as a painter? I like to feel satised. But I can be quite negative, possibly too perfectionist about my own work, feeling I haven't quite got to where I wanted to get. But sometimes - not always - I end up with something other than I had intended, achieving something else, something better than I was aiming for. I aim to try and stop the viewers in their tracks - to wow them, if you like. Not in the sense of making them think 'That's a really good piece of work'. But rather I'm hoping to encourage them to look at what I have done and think 'Goodness. What I happening there? What's all this about?'When I paint it's because I've seen something in the natural world which awes me and I want the viewer to feel what I felt. I want people to look at nature, to see its manifold beauty but also to be aware of its fragility and to be alive to the threat of losing what's so precious in this world. Rosemary Boyle Photo: Anthony Fagin 94book reviews TIMOTHY YATES, The Conversion of the Ma \u00afori:the Years of Religious and Social Change, 1814-1842 (Wm B Eerdmans Publishing Co, Grand Rapids, Michigan/Cambridge, UK, 2013, 150 pp). The dedication is to three 'historians and inspirers of historians in grateful memory', one of whom is Ralph Bennett, 'director of studies at Samuel Marsden's alma mater of Magdalene College, Cambridge'. It is worth recalling that for Ralph, 'excellence in historical writing consists of simple and solid virtues', such as clarity and careful precision, undertaken with enjoyment. He would therefore have approved of this relatively short latest book by Canon Yates (1955), not only for its subject, the establishment of Christian missions in New Zealand from 1814, but for the admirable way it is written. It covers ground which has attracted a lot of anthropological insights and historical controversies, and Yates summarises these succinctly with learned and judicious common sense. He is particularly concerned of course with the nature of religious conversion. He nds that despite a traditional society notoriously given to cannibalism, infanticide, and human sacrice, the Ma \u00afori were 'a spiritual people in whose pre-[European] contact life religion entered at every point'. Their response to missionaries was therefore far from passive, but adept at naturalising the alien religion. He concludes that 'the agents of conversion were the Ma \u00afori themselves, to whom Christianity proved attractive for a wide variety of reasons'. The results of early mission work, Anglican, Wesleyan Methodist, and Catholic, were remarkable. By 1842, when G A Selwyn became the rst Anglican bishop of new Zealand, the Ma \u00afori were substantially Christian: it was estimated that 64,000 were adherents out of a population of 110,000 - about 60%. It was also claimed that New Testaments in translation had been made available for one in every two Ma \u00afori, and even that Ma \u00afori Christianity had become 'better Christianity than that of European settlers'. The conversion process was initiated by Magdalene's Samuel Marsden, 'the Apostle of New Zealand' according to the Church Missionary Society. He rst preached the Gospel there on Christmas Day 1814, a bicentenary shortly to be celebrated, and he made six subsequent voyages from his chaplaincy-base in New South Wales. Marsden died only in 1838, providing the strategic and spiritual direction of the New Zealand Anglican mission for a quarter of a century. Before 95he came up to Magdalene in 1790 aged 25, Marsden had been a Yorkshire apprentice blacksmith, and despite his late-acquired Magdalene veneer, he remained a tough and uncompromising character, something of an ecclesiastical thug. Yates is good at presenting a fair-minded assessment of him, concluding that for all his many obvious faults and failings he was rightly appreciated for his great merits, courage and generosity, and his immense achievements. He was 'treated with something approaching veneration by the Ma \u00afori', even if he suffered from his reputation in Australia as 'a flogging magistrate'. Marsden's steadfast belief in the potential of the Ma \u00afori as 'a noble race' was matched by his vision of New Zealand as a future land of 'ne sheep walks', the 'nest country in the world for wine'. Yates's study may be commended as an attractively manageable and highly readable account of a fascinating transformation in a human society, one in which a great Magdalene man played a key part. R H The Revd Samuel Marsden 96JOHN MOLE, Treatment(Shoestring Press, 2013, 9 pp). There are circumstances in which to keep your wits about you, never mind your wit, is a tough challenge. 'Do you have a line?' asks the nurse, clutching a bag of liquid chemicals: 'No, but I'll think of one' is the Groucho-like response in this self-aware and affecting poem. To say that John Mole's course of chemotherapy in 2013 inspired his wry and reflective work Treatmentis both obviously true and clearly inadequate. The body and the mind play against each other in this lyric, vying as to which will offer the more coherent sense of the immediacy and the quiddity of a human existence. Not surprisingly, then, the naming of selves is important in the sequence. Crucial though they are, the personnel who inhabit the hospital wards are never quite promoted beyond the level of the pronoun - the 'she' who conducts a fatuous survey of levels of fatigue or the 'we' who glance supportively at each other along the rows of drips. But the names of those who populate the mind are properlynouns: Arthur [Sale] is there - the poet's former supervisor at Magdalene and a lifelong friend who died in 2000; and Mark Twain is there, as is Chaucer and the actor Richard Goolden. Harold Pinter makes a cameo appearance. And 'John Mole 12.10.41' is there, conrming movingly that he is 'who I am/ And was and hope to be'. Two-thirds of the way through the poem, another group of names is given startling presence: Retuximab,/Prednisolone, Cyclophosphamide,/ Doxorubican, Vincristine,/Filgrastin. The compounds are difcult in both a medical and a lexical sense, the intriguing and unfamiliar nature of the phonemes representing the love-hate relationship of the patient to his painful therapy. Poets love weird words, of course, and the challenge presented by their abnormal metric patterns ('I remember Adelstrop - the name', writes Edward Thomas in a famous early twentieth-century poem). But in the case of Treatment, we are reminded in this expert poetry that the cancer patient emerges from therapy coerced by fate into becoming an expert in a terminology which is far from obviously poetic. We can forgive the patient a touch of impatience: the well-meaning but vapid remark from a disembodied voice (italicised among a list of other hopelessly inadequate words of encouragement) 'Honestly. That beanie/Suits you' seems to get short shrift: the poet reminds us, when the italics end, that he is hooked to a pump for three hours. Finding words is difcult, for the well-meaning enquirer as for the poet; but Mole in the end seems to think it is worth trying - 'hope', he says, 'punching its weight in sound'.
