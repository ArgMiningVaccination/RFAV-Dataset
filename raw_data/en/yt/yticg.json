Naturopathic physicians seek to restore and maintain optimum health in their patients by emphasizing nature's inherent self-healing process. This is accomplished through education and the rational use of natural therapeutics. The Six Principles of Naturopathic Medicine First, Do No Harm Naturopathic physicians utilize methods and medicinal substances which minimize the risk of harmful side effects, using the least force necessary to diagnose and treat. The Healing Power of Nature Naturopathic physicians act to identify and remove obstacles to healing and recovery, and to facilitate and augment our inherent self-healing processes. Identify and Treat the Cause The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than to merely eliminate or suppress symptoms. Treat the Whole Person Naturopathic physicians treat each patient by taking into account individual physical, mental, emotional, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors. Because total health also includes spiritual health, naturopathic physicians encourage individuals to pursue their personal spiritual development. Doctor as Teacher Naturopathic physicians educate their patients and encourage self-responsibility for health. They also recognize and employ the therapeutic potential of the doctor-patient relationship. Prevention Naturopathic physicians emphasize the power of prevention - assessing risk factors and making appropriate interventions in partnership with their patients to prevent illness. Naturopathic medicine is committed to a the creation of a healthy world in which humanity may thrive. Naturopathic Doctors (NDs) treat all medical conditions seen in primary care practice and can provide both individual and family health care. Among the most common ailments they treat are allergies, digestive issues, diabetes, hormonal imbalances, respiratory conditions, heart disease, fertility problems, menopause, adrenal fatigue, autoimmune disease, and chronic fatigue syndrome. NDs are trained to utilize prescription drugs, although the emphasis of naturopathic medicine is the use of natural healing agents. Please note: Because NDs are not licensed in Michigan, they function as complementary health care providers. Dr Davila maintains her naturopathic physician license in the State of Oregon. NDs are not trained to treat cancer directly - instead, they are trained to offer complementary support to conventional treatment plans. For people seeking support with cancer, Dr Davila refers to her colleagues in naturopathic oncology, [Dr Jen Green](https://drjengreen.com)and [Dr Michael Walker](http://walkernd.com). NDs are not trained to treat pregnancy unless they have a midwifery certification, which Dr. Davila does not. During your first appointment, Dr. Davila will take your health history, find out about your eating habits, stress levels, social habits, and discuss your health goals and objectives. She keeps herself up-to-date on the latest scientific research and incorporates this evidence into her recommendations. Dr. Davila will work with you to set up a customized health management strategy. She can consult with your other health care providers, and if necessary, will refer you to other health care practitioners.
