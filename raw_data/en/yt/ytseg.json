It is used by itself or in conjunction with acupuncture and other therapies. Herbs are prescribed in accordance with Chinese medical philosophy and chosen for each individual specifically. Ongoing research is revealing that herbal substances contain biologically active chemicals, which explains from a scientific perspective how they work. Many modern drugs have been developed from the active ingredients in herbal medicines. Are Chinese Herbs Safe? Chinese herbs are effective and safe when prescribed by a well-trained and skilled practitioner. Reports of contamination of herbs imported from China are a valid concern. At Soaring Crane Acupuncture we only use medicines made by companies that use \"Good Manufacturing Practices\" as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulations ensure that companies follow strict quality control guidelines in preparing, testing, storing, labeling and packaging of dietary supplements and herbs. Careful attention to dosage and understanding of drug-herb interactions are covered in accredited schools of Chinese Medicine. High Quality Herbs At Soaring Crane Acupuncture we use high quality tinctures, pellets and tablets for palatability and ease of use. Tablets and pellets contain either powdered herbs or the dried extract from a decoction. Tinctures are made by extracting the active ingredients of an herb by water, alcohol or glycerin. Herbs For Children In the past ten years many herbal formulas have become available in the United States in palatable tincture form for children and babies who are unable to swallow pills and tablets. The tinctures have proven safe and effective for children's earaches, colds, respiratory ailments and digestive problems. These tinctures have also been prescribed by some alternative pediatricians who understand the long term health problems of giving children too many antibiotics and who have discovered that Chinese anti-viral herbal tinctures, when administered at the early onset of a viral infection, produce rapid results.

In China, the most common method of taking herbs is to prepare a strong decoction by simmering the herbs for one hour, and then drinking the preparation several times per day. For most westerners the decoction is deemed too time consuming, smelly and bad tasting. To address this, different methods of preparation have been developed. These include granules, tablets, tinctures and pellets, which most people find more convenient and palatable. The granular preparations are mixed with hot water and taken as an infusion. Tablets and pellets contain either powdered herbs or the dried extract from a decoction, which produces the best quality. Tinctures are made by extracting the active ingredients of an herb by water, alcohol "}
