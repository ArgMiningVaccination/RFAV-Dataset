It does not cause the [flu](https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/Patients-Families/Health-Library/HealthDocNew/The-Flu-(Influenza)-(1)?id=78147) and it helps keep kids and parents from getting sick. Getting the flu is worse than having a [cold](https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/Patients-Families/Health-Library/HealthDocNew/Colds-(2)?id=78143) and can make a person sick for a week or more. Everyone 6 months of age and older should get vaccinated before the start of each flu season, with very few exceptions. Some people are more likely to get health problems from the flu, such as the elderly, pregnant women, infants, and people with medical conditions like asthma or diabetes. Getting a flu vaccine is especially important for them and for those who live with them. Babies younger than 6 months can't get the vaccine. But they will be protected if their parents, other caregivers, and older kids in the household get it. This is important because infants who get the flu are more likely to have serious problems than older kids. Some things might prevent a person from getting the flu vaccine. Talk to your doctor to see if the vaccine is still recommended if your child: In the past, people with an [egg allergy](https://www.hopkinsallchildrens.org/Patients-Families/Health-Library/HealthDocNew/Egg-Allergy-(3)?id=78084) had to check with their doctor about whether the flu vaccine was OK for them because it's grown inside eggs. But health experts now say that the amount of egg protein in the vaccine is so tiny that it's safe even for kids with a severe egg allergy. Still, someone with an egg allergy (who has had symptoms more severe than hives) should get the flu vaccine in a doctor's office, not at a supermarket, drugstore, or other venue. "}
