Following a year o f devasta ting loss to families, communities and livelihoods worldwide, scientists had developed and administer ed the first globally authoriz ed C OVID-19 vaccines f or emer gency use just days prior to the start o f 2021. Here at Sabin, we joined the scientific and global health communities in celebra ting this extraor dinary moment and the ensuing optimism. And then, we got back to work. New vaccines meant new opportunities and new challenges \u2014 fr om the logistics o f vaccina ting the world to opportunities to build on the historic collabora tions tha t produced these lif esaving vaccines. Sabin's position a t the nexus o f vaccine stakeholders has given us a unique r ole in f ostering even gr eater understanding and collabora tion to tackle this pandemic and prevent the next one. We began with the true experts, the pr ofessionals working on the gr ound and on the fr ontlines, and the communities they serve in low- and middle-income countries. W e adapted our tools f or use in under -resour ced settings, pr oducing mini case studies, podcasts and other multimedia o fferings with firsthand insights ar ound vaccine r oll outs, equity , and acceptance. W e chipped away a t wha t the W orld Health Or ganiza tion has an tion and or journalists, immuniza tion pr ofessionals and health work ers seeking to incr ease accura te reporting, communica tion, and advocacy ar ound vaccines in mor e than 50 countries. The work we do is essential to help incr ease vaccine uptak e. A r ecent Lancet study f ound tha t COVID-19 vaccines sa ved nearly 20 million lives globally in the first year , cutting the potential dea th toll by an estima ted 63%. However , as you r ead this, just about 21% o f people in low-income countries ha ve received a t least one dose o f the vaccine and in some countries, uptak e has now stalled a t 50%. \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0012\u0001*NQBDU\u00013 FQPSU\u00011SJOU Page 54BCJO\u00017BDDJOF\u0001*OTUJUVUF At the same time, the pandemic along with an incr eased number o f childr en living in con flict z ones wer e key factors f or global childhood vaccina tions plummeting to their lowest level in 30 years in 2021; the steep decline is just mor e proof of the critical need f or continuing and str engthening our support to global immuniza tion pr ograms. W e expanded our disease bur den surveillance and vaccine impact work, drawing on established community partnerships to collect new vaccine da ta and cr eate cost-eff ective diagnostics f or typhoid. We continued to r esear ch leaders ar pa thways towar d next genera tion in fluenza vaccines to pr event an even deadlier pandemic. And we continued further r esear ch into developing vaccines against two o f the world's deadliest diseases, Ebola Sudan and Marbur g. Our vaccine candida tes ha ve each clear ed Phase 1B trials demonstra ting sa fety, paving the way f or Phase 2 efficacy trials to begin soon. The need f or Sabin's appr oach to vaccine innova tion is in Sabin's community , which ovides skill- and car eer-building tools to immuniza tion professionals, soar ed 54% to mor e than 1800 participants. Applica tions f or our signa ture grant pr ogram r esour cing social and behavioral studies a t the community level incr eased 290%. We are also str engthening our own ganiza tion. Sabin established a sta ff-level Diversity , Equity and Inclusion (DEI) committee last year and launched an action plan . New DEI initia tives curr ently underway include setting up an annual scholarship fund f or a STEM and/or public health student a t a historically black college and or ganizing a work shop to develop measurable mechanisms to track DEI -related goals within Sabin pr ogram and opera ting teams. The or ganiza tion's financial pictur e is healthy with 2021 r evenue a t $27M . We received funding fr om government agencies, founda tions, corpora te entities, and countless individuals fr om ar ound the world. \u0013\u0011\u0013\u0012\u0001*NQBDU\u00013 FQPSU\u00011SJOU Page 64BCJO\u00017BDDJOF\u0001*OTUJUVUF Your shared dedication ensures that our work will continue until every family who needs a vaccine, of any kind, can get one.

F rom typhoid to C OVID-19, these eff orts r eflected our f evidence-based and multidisciplinary collabora tions. 12th Conference on T yphoid and Other Invasive Salmonelloses In December 2021, we held the 12th Conference on Typhoid and Other Invasive Salmonelloses. This virtual event br ought together mor e than 400 r esear chers, health work ers, civil society r epresenta tives and government and industry pr ofessionals to ex change the latest findings and r esear ch on typhoid, para typhoid, and invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella disease. Nearly 90% o f attendees surveyed f elt they'd achieved their goals, which included gr eater understanding o f conjuga te typhoid vaccines ( TCV) intr oduction, new o f typhoid. 2021 Impact R eport Page 12Sabin V accine on Collabora tion: In May 2021, the Sabin- Aspen V accine Science & Policy Group r eleased its la test report exploring real-time lessons from the record-breaking development of COVID-19 vaccines for the futur e of vaccine R&D . The report shar es five \" Big Ideas\" to r ethink the development of vaccines to help pr event futur e pandemics and check ongoing disease thr eats lik e malaria, TB and HIV . Disease Burden Sur veillance Studies Our Ser o-epidemiology and Envir onmental Surveillance (SEES) study continued to build on community partnerships in Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan to valida te a more accessible, cost-effective diagnostic test for enteric fever. And the Coalition against T yphoid continued to bring evidence o f the bur den o f enteric f ever, including incr eased drug r esistance, and new vaccine efficacy analysis to high-risk countries considering adding T CV to immuniza tion pr ograms. 2021 13Sabin V accine Institute Exploring What' s Behind Vaccine Acceptance and Demand 2021 Impact R eport Page 1 4Sabin V accine Institute What fuels vaccine uptak e in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)? Sabin's V accine Acceptance & Demand team invests in a global network o f social and beha vioral scientists, academics, global health experts and community partners uncovering the complexities o f why people welcome and want vaccines fr om the gr ound up. With an emphasis on locally driven solutions, our 2021 eff orts marry evidence-based stra tegies tha t engage social scientists, journalists and health work ers to meet their communities' needs. Social and Behavioral R esearch Grants For the thir d year , our Social and Behavioral R esearch Grants program funded local r esear ch teams in LMICs exploring structural, cultural, economic and social drivers o f vaccine acceptance and demand in their communities. Following a 290% increase in applica tions r eceived, ten selected projects explored vaccine equity , marginalized communities and online messaging stra tegies. In 2021, we r equir ed pr oject teams to be multidisciplinary in expertise, ha ve established partnerships with local or ganiza tions and support o f the community in which the r esear ch was to be conducted, and outline an appropria te pr oject output (e.g., policy briefs, solution pa thway papers, case studies etc.) and f easible dissemina tion channel to reach r elevant audiences (e.g., immuniza tion pr ogram; Ministry o f Health). This wide-ranging appr oach amplifies impact o f the pr ogram, or ganiza tions to quickly transla tes pr ogram, Sabin work ed with partners to support journalists and health work ers to report, communica te or advoca te accura tely on vaccines and immuniza tion. We provided 337 media pr ofessionals fr om 53 countries with k ey in forma tion to support accura te reporting on C OVID-19 vaccines and other immuniza tion topics, as well as tools to learn mor e and connections to expert sour ces. W e also trained and mentor ed a total o f 107 journalists fr om 30 low- and middle-income countries in Africa, the Americas and Eastern Europe, helping them to develop in-depth stories on vaccines and immuniza tion. Following this training, the journalists published mor e than 200 stories and investiga tive r eports in local, r egional and global media outlets. Sabin ed with the Interna tional Pedia tric Associa tion (IP A), guiding mor e than 1,200 health work ers fr om 1 47 countries through a nine-module course covering in fodemiology , beha vioral science, advocacy and media engagement to enhance their vaccine communica tions and advocacy skills. In collabora tion with the Nursing Now Challenge, we selected seven nurses thr ough a competitive pr ocess to r eceive training on storytelling and vaccine advocacy . These nurses deliver ed their messages to the Interna tional Council o f Nurses Congr ess 2021, which was a ttended by 5 ,255 participants fr om 131 countries. This gr oup o f nurses continues to advoca te for vaccine acceptance and equity within their communities and globally . 2021 Impact R eport Page 17Spotlight on Collabora tion: V accine Acceptance & Demand and Boost teams collabora ted with the Bay Ar ea Global Health Alliance and the Alliance f or Advancing Health Online.

This includes successful Phase 1b clinical trials in the United S tates demonstra ting the vaccines wer e well tolera ted, and no sever e adverse events wer e reported. With these da ta, Sabin is designing Phase 2 clinical trials to be launched in Africa in 2023 . In September 2021, the Biomedical Advanced Resear ch and Development Authority (BARD A), part o f the U .S. Department o f Health and Human Services, ex ercised its thir d contract option valued a t $34 .5 million. This funding enables continued nonclinical efficacy and sa fety studies, the Phase 2 clinical trials and vaccine manufacturing pr ocesses to ensur e quality and safety. To date, BARD A has invested $75 million in Sabin's Ebola and Marbur g R&D pr ogram. Tackling Marburg with the W orld Heal th Organiza tion When a Marbur g virus disease outbr eak occurr ed in Guinea in August 2021, the WHO invited Sabin to join a gr oup o f experts from industry , government and academia dedica ted to the rapid development o f Marbur g vaccines, called MARV AC. As a MARVAC member, Sabin continues to support stra tegies to shar e knowledge, labora tory network s and other r esour ces to ensure communities ha ve the tests, vaccines and medicines to a vert lar ge scale health crises. 2021 Impact R eport Page 23Filovirus V accine R esearch Sabin convened mor e than 30 k ey scientific and r egula tory leaders to consider actionable steps f or br oader filovirus vaccine resear ch \u2014 Ebola and Marbur g are two o f the better -known members o f the filovirus family .
