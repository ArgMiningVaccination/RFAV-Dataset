Seeing my patients five or 10 years after their bone marrow transplant \u2014 and hearing about all they have accomplished \u2014 always puts a smile on my face. \" - Dr. Aleksandra Petrovic specializes in bone marrow transplantation for children with non-malignant conditions, such as bone marrow failure disorders or metabolic disorders. While a bone marrow transplant is a lifesaving therapy, it can be very disruptive to daily life. Dr. Petrovic guides each patient and family through this process, discussing the potential risks and benefits, sharing what to expect, working through complications that arise and providing support through the highs and lows. Dr. Petrovic also is a physician at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and an associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the University of Washington School of Medicine. - Related Pages - [Dr. Petrovic's Bibliography (NIH)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=aleksandra+petrovic) aleksandra petrovic - Search Results - PubMed - - - We look forward to seeing her every time we come there!
