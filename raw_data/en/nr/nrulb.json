PublicHealth | pp. 1-3 | doi:10.1093/pubmed/fdaa278 Results of mental support for health care professionals and mental care during the COVID-19 pandemic Lars de Vroege1,2, The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted into a global pandemic and continues to thrive until vaccines have been successfully developed and distributed around the world. The outcomes of COVID-19 contaminations range from death to minor health-relatedcomplaints. Furthermore, and not less significant, the increasing pressure on local as well as global health care is rising. In The Netherlands butalso in other countries, further intensified regulations are introduced in order to contain the second wave of COVID-19, primarily to limit thenumber contaminations but also to prevent the health care professionals for giving in to the rising pressure on them. The results of thecampaign for health care professionals in The Netherlands show that health care professionals are increasingly searching for informationregarding psychological symptoms such as feeling of uncertainty, pondering and advice regarding the support of care teams. In this shortupdate, we provide the results of the previous campaign and stress the importance of support after COVID-19 based on these results. TheCoronavirusdisease2019(COVID-19)anditspandemic has become a serious threat for public mental health and concernsmanycountriesallovertheworld.1Preventivemea- sures are introduced by governments all over the world andpeople's attitude towards these measures vary. 2Such non- therapeuticmeasures(e.g.lockdown,partiallockdown,socialdistancing, self-isolation and others) are essential in order tolimitthefurthercontinuationof thepandemic, 3butonemust not forget to address the therapeutic measures as, perhapsequally,important.Indisputably,COVID-19hasmajorimpacton mental health and decline of well-being 4during (partly) lockdown measures, social distancing and other necessarytaken measures. As a result of the pandemic, people experi-encedeteriorationinmentalandphysicalhealthastheyingen-eral accept limitation regarding mobility, which in turn maylead to loneliness or social isolation. 5,6Since the pandemic continues,thepressureonhealthcareprofessionalscontinuesas well, which calls for therapeutic support in case of, e.g.exhaustion.Moreover,suchsupportshouldalsobedevelopedfor the general population who experience symptoms afterCOVID-19. Incontrovertibly, health care professionals are exposed to long-lasting elevated psychological stress during this contin- uing pandemic, which also results in increased reports of anxietyanddepression, 7initsturncontributingtoanelevated psychologicalburdenacrosspopulationsworldwideinhealthcare professionals.

It is promising to see that the support of health care professionals gains attention(e.g. Frias et al. 10) and the development of protocols for this profession is increasing, which looks promising. Since thepandemic will continue for a while, at least until the releaseof a vaccine, the pressure on health care professionals willremainpresentforawhile. Psychosocial support after COVID-19 Furthermore, studies conducted in the USA also show clearsigns of the harmful consequences both mentally and psy-chologically of COVID-19 in the general population (e.g.anxietyanddepression). 11ResultsfromTheNetherlandsare currentlycollected12butareexpectedtoshowsimilarresults. These studies stress the necessity of the development oftreatment protocols for individuals among the general pop-ulation.Moreover,twotypesof individualscanbeidentied,individualswhosufferfromtheconsequencesafteraCOVID-19infectionandindividualswhosufferfromconsequencesofCOVID-19 pandemic (e.g. anxiety for infection, experiencefeelings of loneliness) and/or loss of loved ones. The con-sequences of COVID-19 in both groups are persistent. 13-15 Psychological symptoms of the rst group of individuals consist of post-traumatic stress disorder,16fear of stigma and/or infection, sleep and/or mood disorders,17persistent cognitive symptoms18and feeling of loneliness due to socialisolation.19It is key that both are treated adequately and, moreimportantly,asquicklyaspossibleafterclinicalsignsarepresenttopreventanylong-termconsequences.AtreatmentprogramcalledCO-Fit19iscurrentlyintroducedintheSouthof the Netherlands and individuals from both groups aregettingsignedup 20. The consequences of COVID-19 infection but also due to the COVID-19 pandemic regarding mental health areclear. Psychosocial support is pivotal in these times wherethe COVID-19 infections increase, especially for healthcare professionals for which the pressure and heightenedworkloadwillcontinue.Furthermore,twotypesof treatmentoptions can be identied for individuals from the generalpopulation. Firstly, psychosocial support for individuals whosuffer from the consequences after COVID-19 infectionis crucial. Secondly, support for individuals who sufferfrom the results of the COVID-19 pandemic is also stressed. These three therapeutic elements in psychosocial support regarding COVID-19 should be adapted in generalhealth care practice as quickly as possible to preventany long-term consequence of the COVID-19 pandemicas the consequences for mental health should not beunderestimated.
