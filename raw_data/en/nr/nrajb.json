Concerning this year's meeting, youwill note from theprogram that anacceptable basis forobserved scaling relations avariety of parameters maybejust around thecorner. Ibelieve this results from several factors. Inthefirst place, this year there aremany more than which canbecharacterized astheoretical, they aresupported by carefully obtained experimental data. Inthesecond place, these more analytical reports with their adjunct data aretaken onreal world samples, andthus areofimmediate interest toanyone interested intheresponse elements inpractical high ix power laser environments. Finally, thesamples utilized inthese tests (with the aidandinput ofmaterial scientists) have been characterized better andmore completely. Inthefuture, weexpect that thereal world response will beunraveled even further asuseofsophisticated andsensitive characterization methods become more generally available.

Working sessions oftheCommittee F-lSubcommittee were held on Monday, 29October. About 150scientists attended theSymposium, including representatives oftheUnited Kingdom, France, Canada, Japan, West Germany andDenmark. TheSymposium was divided into sessions concerning Transparent Optical Materials andtheMeasurement ofTheir Properties, Mirrors andSurfaces, Thin Film Characteristics, Thin Film Considera- tions forHigh Power Systems, andfinally Theory andBreakdown. Asinprevious years, several poster sessions were held. Thegeneral consensus ofthose presenting poster papers andthose viewing them washighly favorable. Inall, over forty technical presentations were made. Harold E.Bennett oftheNaval Weapons Center, Alexander J.Glass oftheLaw- rence Livermore H.Guenther oftheAirForce Weapons Laboratory, E.Newnam oftheLosAlamos Scientific oftheSymposium. Atthis, ourTenth lasers. Theauthors will welcome comments andcriticism from allinterested readers relevant tothis purpose andparticularly relative scheduled Boulder, power ithashadonlaser system design that areassessment needs tobemade. Insimpler terms, somewhat simple problems have been overcome primarily through theapplications ofobvious solutions such ashigh- purity starting materials, high-precision andsystem performance. Asan indication ofthis philosophy, Major Harry Windsor, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, indicated that that agency wasencouraging more fundamental work onmaterial and material/optical interactions than formerly wasthecase. Studies will undoubtedly become more experimental inattempting toidentify salient properties andfeatures ofthefunda- mental laser material interaction scenario andthus less applied. This isnottomean that applied technology will notcontinue buttheemphasis will most certainly change. Itis anticipated that thedirectly applied work will concentrate onreal world components as opposed tostudying intrinsic damage mechanisms inanattempt toreduce costs andimprove component reliability. AsfarastheU.S. Government isconcerned, increased emphasis will begiven wavelength theuv,novel polishing procedures, more stringent coating tolerances, etc., will be required. AttheSymposium, thepresented papers concentrated onmaterials andmeasurement of their properties, mirrors andoptical surfaces, thin films anddamage sensitivity, systems considerations and, asusual, theory andbreakdown phenomena. Asexpected, themajority of papers again concerned theAchilles heel ofthin films. Itwasthere, together with new revealing theoretical descriptions oftheinteraction process, that thegreatest advances were reported. manufacture elements. isproving veils improvement intheshort-pulse damage threshold strength of10while producing little, ifany, in- crease inscattering.

This is avery exciting observation butnottotally unexpected since flame polishing, acid etching oranyother process which tends toremove impurities asamethod toimprove surface damage resistance iswell-known. machining. Asanindication that wehave progressed intheunderstanding oflaser interaction with materials, particularly inthecase ofmetals, several papers dealt with both the theory ofrepetitive interaction oflaser pulses with laser irradiation. The- oretical predictions were shown tobeinessential agreement with experimental results obtained over very small areas. Ifonecontinued topulse until melt damage, theexperi- mentally measured threshold agreed with afirst principles calculation tobetter than one percent.

Oneinteresting presentation concerned theselection ofcomponents inhigh average power laser systems. These systems normally employ cooled mirrors anduncooled windows. Using anexponential Strehl relation asanindicator ofthefigure ofsystem inhigh power systems. Itwasconcluded that thewindows frequently compensate forthedistortions normally introduced bycooled mirrors.

TheWeibull distribution isappropriate tothese lowductility components and allows scaling from small tolarge samples. This should beanimportant engineering tool insystems their characterization anddamage threshold. This isnotsurprising considering that thedamage threshold ofthin films isroutinely lower than surface damage thresholds andlower still than bulk breakdown limits. However, from this year's Symposium itisobvious tonote theincreased sophistication with which this area improvement both inperformance andunderstanding offilms Of considerable importance isthecareful andphysical properties with process variables. Inthis regard, acorrelation ofthese process variables with grain size washeard. that there was aratio of8to 1indamage threshold when thegrain size changed from 20to600K.Thesmaller grain film cor- responds toaglassy coating exhibiting alower refractive index film.

But, onhigh quality films where absorption waslow, variations ofthedamage threshold with film absorption were notreadily evident. Some interesting results onthedamage sensitivity offilms subjected to800ns, 1urnlaser pulses were reported. Atthese relatively long pulse lengths correlation between film absorption anddamage threshold wasalso reported.

Historically, thesession devoted totheory andbreakdown among the most agitated. Incomparison, this year theparticipants were more attentive, primarily fortworeasons. First, some ofthepresentations were notvery controversial andsecondly, theories were supported bycareful experimental data asopposed totheconjecture previously heard when there available. Inthefirst theindividual theories duetoKeldysh, allthephoton inasingle event rather than inmany small increments asforexample inaseries of scattering processes. This approach isprobably appropriate between 1and10urn,butat shorter wavelengths afurther evaluation isnecessary. Another scattering anditsuseasalimiter ofnonlinear Methods ofpreventing feedback from SBSwere also discussed. Thetwomost important analytical revelations atthis meeting concerned thefrequency dependence ofthin film damage based onanimpurity model and aquantitative assessment of focal volume effects inrelation torecently reported Soviet work. Concerning thethin film issue, early work ontherole that metallic impurities ofbulk dielec- trics hasbeen todielectric were assumed tobenolarger than thethickness ofthefilms. Based upon this restriction, Mie invoked. thetheory predicts that asoneprogresses tothinner films the damage resistance increases. This mayoffer great benefit forultraviolet coatings. In theother prime theoretical work, aresolution ofthedifference between small focal spot size andlarge focal spot size data forbulk damage waspresented. Generally there isvery little spot-size dependence forlarge beams while there isaspot size effect forsmall beams. This difference manifests itself inadifferent frequency scaling aswell. This data nowadequately describes some heretofore confusing results reported bySoviet workers. 3.Summary ofPapers Thesubject matter oftheTenth Anniversary (Eleventh) Symposium covered sixbroad areas ofinterest tothehigh power laser community. These ofTheir Properties, forHigh Systems, and finally (6)Theory andBreakdown. These Conference areorganized accordingly. Inthis Section, aconcise summary ofeach paper isprovided. Closely related papers are discussed together, whenever possible. Theinterested reader isreferred tothecomplete isintroduced with Asistheusual case, thisyear's Symposium ledoffwith papers dealing trans- parent optical materials, themeasurement oftheir properties, andthecorrelation ofthese properties with failure. Thematerials discussed were those most useful attheextremes of thehigh power frequency regimes, namely thenear ultraviolet andtheinfrared urn. Thefirst setofpapers reported thecontinuing advances being made inthepress-forging of optical materials, namely LiF, CaF,,, andNaCl. Another paper concerned itself with the accurate prediction ofthephysical response ofZnSe windows subjected tohigh power CCL lasers. Until this year, LiFhasnotbeen seriously considered asapractical window material foruvlasers because ofitslowyield strength energy. Toovercome these objections, J.F. Ready and H.Vora oftheHoneywell Corporate Material Sciences Center have produced polycrystall ineLiFwindows using atwo-stage forging process.

However, thevalue ofthe distribution than ofthethermal model was inpredicting result oftheconsiderable uncertainty (30to100%) inthemeasured values duetothe gauges themselves. Another diverse group ofpapers dealt more with themeasurement ofoptical properties formaterials important inhigh power laser systems. These included thedetermination of non-linear indices technique offers greater detectabil ity foradsorbed aswell asincluded impurities. Finally, theuseofsynchrotron radiation to thephoto-electron band region oflowindex materials such asBeF\u00a3 glasses wasreported. Nonlinear phase distortion leading foreither cooling measurements ofthevarious KBr and KC1samples allhadthesame dominant features with slight differences attributed to various surface contaminants anddifferences incrystal linity andgrowth oftheNaval Research Laboratory andM.J. Weber of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory reported ontheir recent synchrotron radiation studies of pure beryllium fluoride (BeF^) about 5.8-eV wide (FWHM), with atail ofstates extending outto7eV. These features are consistent with previous measurements that thepractical transmission limit is150nm (8.3 eV). Thefinal group ofpapers inthis topical area dealt primarily with crystalline and glassy materials ranging from therole iron impurities play indamage tostress failure analysis their efforts toisolate thesignificant impurities inKBrcrystals that limit thelaser damage threshold.

Other factors which cancause early failure ofbrittle windows areslow crack growth caused byacorrosive agent such aswater, residual stresses introduced during parts containing critical flaws. 3.2 Mirrors andSurfaces Thepapers dealing with mirrors andsurfaces were divided between failure tometal mirrors anddielectric surfaces. Thefirst paper dealing with metal mirrors wasconcerned with theresponse ofeach element when subjected torepetitive laser pulses. Papers along these lines have been eagerly awaited bytheSymposium participants. Other papers onmetal mirrors were centered onafirst principal calculation ofanultimate melt failure criteria andexperimental verification, level 14 slip will beobserved with optical absorptance, thermal conductivity, density, specific heat, asparameters. Numerical threshold calculated forcopper using this theory are inreasonably good agreement with previously reported experimental results. Oneresult ofthis newwork isthat thetemperature rise at which plastic yield will occur isvery low, being approximately 20\u00b0 Kforpure copper under short-pulse, large spot size laser irradiation. Repetitive-pulse irradiation, where each pulse raises thetemperature bymore than 40\u00b0 K ,isexpected tocause bands, intergranular slip andfatigue cracking. Amechanism for increased optical scattering andcoating degradation caused bylocalized delamination or cracking ofthefilm under continued laser irradiation issuggested bythismechanism and should beinvestigated further. Laser damage thresholds observed experimentally areusually significantly lower than those predicted theoretically from thematerial properties oftheirradiated samples. Some ofthis oftheeffect of surface conditions ondamage threshold incopper. They obtained excellent agreement with theory when using samples with thehighest quality surface conditions. They reported that themeasured peak damage threshold forlaser-induced melting This almost exactly with afirst-principles calculation ofthemelt threshold ofcopper forthis pulse shape. agreement between theory andexperiment isvery reassuring since damage experiments agreement reduced themelt threshold even inmelt threshold andwasnearly inversely proportional melt threshold.

Silicon carbide substrates were used samples tested andthereduced melt threshold observed (50J/cm )wasattributed totheir conductivity. Themelt ifhigher conductance substrates were used, asignificant improvement indamage threshold would have been observed.

The session dealing with Theory andBreakdown always leads tothegreatest andoften most heated participation oftheattendees. This year's wasnoexception. Very basic papers ona detailed formalism describing multiphoton absorption andavalanche breakdown were heard, as well asanextended andmore comprehensive model forwavelength-sensitive, impurity-initialed breakdown onoptical thin films. wasfollowed performed experimental measurements ofbulk breakdown, which ledtoanunraveling ofdata presented atprevious symposiums this Finally, with theinfluence ofstimulated Brillouin scattering onthedamage process These theoretical expositions generally attempt tocorrelate with theexpanding data base of carefully performed experiments inshort-wavelength high- power lasers whether pulsed, rep-rated orcontinuous wave. While onegenerally feels that thermal windows duetoabsorption canbehandled semi-quantitatively, calculation oftheabsorption itself isanother ofpapers dealing with performed acritical analysis ofavailable theoretical descriptions fornonlinear absorption processes.

Concerning this latter case, there areseveral errors intheoriginal Basov treatment which have been identified andcorrected.

Ingeneral, theallowed-forbidden formulas lead togross underestimates of theKeldysh formula offers asufficiently accurate description ofthemultiphoton absorption process even when thephoton multiplicity is small. These just stated conclusions aredrawn from acomparison ofavailable experimental results andcalculations based upon theimproved theoretical descriptions.

However, theavalanche mechanism treatment offers better agreement with measured values. Themultiphoton treatment gives opto-electric field strengths substan- tially andare inbetter agreement with experimental results. Theauthors con- cluded that since neither treatment adequately explains alltheappropriate features of damage, such asfrequency andpulse length dependence, itisbetter tocombine them. This wasdone inasimple manner with improved results.

Fairly uncomplicated results fortheoretical expressions were obtained from asimplified model ofthegrowth oftheelectron energy inthepresence thedistinction lies inthecomparison ofthe optical frequency totheelectron current relaxation rate. These predictions generally agree with Manenkov's observations. Therelative values ofthebreakdown thresholds agreement with Manenkov's measurements, and threshold values forthese materials at293\u00b0 Kand1.06 ym areingeneral agreement with theobservations. Using andUhlmann's paper describing metallic impurity initiated breakdown inglass hosts asajumping-off point, T.W.

This arises from thefact that themodel predicts that different sized impurities arethemost damage sensitive atdifferent pulse lengths andfrequencies, thepulse length variation ofdamage 112goes etal., (presented tofused silica surfaces. There hasbeen acontinuing controversy arising onthesubject ofthescaling relationships governing thevariation ofdamage thresholds with spot size and frequency.

Thedamage threshold decreased asthesurface disorder increased, again in agreement with theoretical expectations. Itwould bemost desirable toqualify triumph wasthedemonstration that laser-induced slip, which occurs atmuch lower levels than melting, canbepredicted quantitatively bytheory. Such slip may increase scattered light, degrade coating performance andreduce damage threshold. Its continued development may infact precipitate catastrophic damage inlaser components. These possibilities have not, however, been demonstrated andmore experimental andthe- oretical work employing large spot sizes should bedone todetermine theimplications of this theory. Since real devices, particularly intheultraviolet, arefrequently repetitively pulsed, there isagrowing need fordamage thresholds under Also, very long quasi-cw pulse lengths (10-20 us)need tobeinvestigated.

Ring fractures arefrequently associated with surface contaminants onbrittle materials. In those cases inwhich thestrain energy from overall heating islarge, thering fractures will nucleate cracks which propagate across theheated nucleate acrack induced when stress upon cooldown following theirradiation. Thetensile stresses maydevelop either through rapid surface cooling which isunlikely inatypical window configuration which does notinvolve an active cooling system; or,more likely, thetensile stresses develop when thesurface has been permanently deformed bycompressive stresses which produce yielding while thebeam ison. Once permanent deformation hasoccurred, thematerial cannot relax generating large tensile forces.

Theacoustic wave speed inmost metals isapproximately 5x10^cm/s. propagate over .Putanother way, regions having that issubstantially heated during pulsed laser irradiation. Itcanbe shown that inmost metals acoustic waves cantravel across distances greater than thether- ofapproximately 15ps .Hence, itcanreason- ably beassumed that transient stress relaxation will exist normally through thenear-surfac heated region attimes substantially greater than 15ps .However, stress relaxation in directions parallel tothefree surface ofthestructure, orthe irradiation signifies region hastransverse dimensions substantially larger than both thethermal penetration depth andthetransverse stress relaxation distance forthepulse duration under consideration. Theanalysis presented here isconfined totheshort-pulse large-spot interaction regime, where normal stress relaxation exists through theheated near-surface region ofa metal, a1-ns tion pulse applied over atleast a10-fxm diameter spot pulse applied over atleast diameter spot, ifonly theresponse during thetrans- verse inertial confinement approximation will notbeapplicable. Although similar physical behavior will still occur, thequantitative relationships derived herewill notbevalid. 2.2. Elastic response Thetransient mechanical response ofmaterials under rapid heating conditions, ina number ofspecialized circumstances, hasbeen previously investigated. Forexample, Mura[1]\"*\"considered both asemi-infinite block and asemi- infinitely long cylinder where theplane surfaces were subjected toaninstantaneous temperature change. Boley andTolins [2]considered ahalf-space whose free White [3]analyzed considered heat neglecting heat conduction. Duley more recent work involving laser ofmaterial surfaces where surface vaporization, plasma pressure, andnormal stress waves areemphasized. None ofthese analyses directly addresses thespecific situation of interest here. However, they dosupport theearlier assertation that thenormal stress in thenear-surface region quickly tothefree surface value.

However, experimental studies [11to17]ofthefatigue failure ofpure copper under alternating stress-strain conditions consistently show that afatigue life greater than increases asstrain strain as illustrated OAB, thestress increases totheyield stress andthen remains con- stant during plastic contraction fromAtoB.Now, upon returning ABisgreater than theelastic ^yield strain, then path must also include plastic strain, asshown inOABDFGE.

This regime ends, andtheplastic regime begins, when theoctahedral shear stress reaches thevalue occurs areillustrated inthestress-strain diagram infigure 2.Note that mechanical strain (AT )isless thanAT y atthesurface will both heating andcooling oneach cycle. Theincrement ofplastic deformation that is thefirst isapparent from figure as described above, theplastic deformation tends tooccur along closely spaced slip planes that form slip bands. These bands widen across thesurface andform more prominent extru- roughening toplastic strain accumulation. Eventually fatigue cracks occur attheslip bands. Thus, thefatigue life ofametal under cyclic deformation also depends onthetotal accumulated plastic strain. 3.Metal surface heating Thetemperature rise ofametal surface under radiation isdeposited toheat) within thenear-surface region (electromagnetic skin depth) normal ambient wavelength > range, longer than 25ps.

Because theelastic response regime extends over only asmall temperature excursion, surface displacement will be 2approximately 0.6nmperincident J/cm intheelastic response regime. 4.Theoretical-experimental correlation Direct correlation oftheoretical predictions based ontheanalysis presented herewith presently available experimental data isdifficult forseveral reasons. Early evidence [20] ofplastic yield under pulsed wasobtained under small-spot where transverse andstress relaxation effects would beactive. Furthermore theincident fluence levels were high enough tocause surface melting. However, plastic yield effects were observed outside ofthemelt zone, aswould beexpected.

Special thin films were fabricated toexercise various capabilities oftheanalysis Theresults presented arefrom wasapproximately inorder excessive sputter times functional coating design foranenhanced reflector including thebase metal reflector were utilized assubstrates inorder toprovide aconducting medium which could break inthecoating foredge profiles. Thesamples were Ar+sputtered with SIMS data recorded during thesputtering process. AES andXPSdata would betaken between sputtering sequences toproduce profiles ofthe coatings. Analysis wasconducted, when feasible, wasused formost electron microscope (SEM) photographs stages oftheprofile. Several prominent dust particles areevident ontheotherwise featureless surface which provide areference fortheremaining photographs. After sputtering into theZnSlayer, several point defects orimpurity sites appear. Further sputtering down toapproximately o 1500 Aexposes additional impurity sites, allofwhich Each ofthese disk shapped areas house oneoftheimpurity sites. This point defect and halo region remain intact even into theThF4layer. Insulating properties ofThF4reduce, tosome extent, theresolution halos are al<;n visually observable. Themicrograph indicates possible heiqht differences between halo regions andthe surrounding area. Height variations could beaconsequence ofdifferent orbiased sputtering rates. Thegeometrical ingreater detail incorporating various microanalysis techniques. Thecontrasting horizontal line extending through thehalo region waselectron beam induced during AESline scans. Although thehalo itself maybeanartifact ion bombardment during thesputtering process, asimilar consequence isapparent intheAuger analyzed areas which subjected totheelectron beam. Inaddition, thesurface isalso disturbed, toamuch since sputtering wasterminated intheThF^ layer. Inaddition to these elements, however, there isasubstantial amount of0present. Thelarge amount of oxygen present, other films such asZnS, ZnSe, Ag,Cr,CeF, andA^O-j, indicates substantial water content intheThF^ film. This concurs with corresponding SIMS analysis inwhich both Hand0areobservable andalso supports the conclusions ofanindependent signatures arerelatively unchanged. Thefluxofincident argon ions during the sputtering process collide andinteract with theThF^ compounds driving offsome ofthe loosely especially XPSdata taken onanewly exposed surface from sputtering indicate that the oxygen concentration increases asafunction oftime. This implies shown infigure 7.Again fluorine andoxygen dominates theenergy compared onthehalo. Both elemental maps, also provide useful information andverify many oftheconclusions stated above. AnFelemental map, figure 8,illustrates thelack ofFinthehalo region. Themapping technique displays four levels ofelemental concentrations ranging from black, representing nondetectabl eamounts, areas exhibits theeffect Incomparison elements. Ascan wasmade across thehalo region, through increases, thehalo concentration decreases. Theamounts detected radically change asthedefect center isreached. This sequence isreversed astheprobe beam moves beyond detection ofpoint defects isenhanced through these processes. Line scans across theedgeofafilm exposed after thesilicon chip iscleaved are also possible provided thethickness ofthethin film layers isgreater than the resolving power oftheanalysis beam. This does occur formost films designed for operation intheinfrared. Toobtain anedge scan onthecoating designed forand utilized inthis study, film edge created upon sputtering during aSIMS profile wasline scanned from thebottom ofthecrater, which was respectively, representation of asputtered elemental line scans ofthefilm. Contaminants can befollowed inthismanner also. Definite boundaries areevident indicating the compositional structure ofthethin film stack. With ahigh resolution probe, point areas within layers canthen beanalyzed inmuch greater detail analysis wasconducted with RAP processed ThF. andtheother with Balzers ThF^. Both E-beam through thefirst layer ofZnSandwell made onthebulk materials with thesame conclusions. Independent analysis [4]onsimilarly coated films support, ingeneral, theconclusions presented here. Theexact history and handling procedures ofthese isnotknown andmayhavecontributed vender, supplier ofbasic coating materials, deposition techniques, ordeposition facilities. Under aspace radiation program conducted byNWC[5], several coatings ofZnSandThF^ were found toexperience similar point defects with corresponding halos. Other films in atypical storage environment were found todeteriorate asafunction oftime. The latter degradation isprobably appear shaped more ThF^ denominator atthis point appears tobeThF^.

None ofthefilms studied, however, were totally free from point defects orimpurity sites. Itwasobvious that anydefect orimpurity became readily apparent during the analysis process.

Forabsorptance values above 100ppm, there isastrong correlation between damage threshold andabsorption. However, forabsorptance 100ppm, itappears that damage threshold isnotrelated film.

Cleaning thesurfaces wasimportant because dust onthesurface will burn andinduce damage atfluence than thebulk damage threshold ofBK-7. Apossible major cause ofthesurface threshold being significantly less than the bulk isthat theoptical grinding andpolishing process leaves aphysical-disturbed and chemically-contaminated surface layer called theBeilby layer, with thickness of10-100 urn. Measurements ofabsorption asafunction ofthesample indicate cm-lto10cm-!.Polishing compounds areanapparent, obvious surface-layer impurities. In fact, chemical analysis atLLLofavariety ofcommon polishing compounds andlap materials found metallic impurities atconcentrations of10^ppm. Table 1lists the species andconcentrations which were measured. Later, achemical analysis ofthe surface layer, removed byacid etch, demonstrated that these impurities did infact become imbeded inthesurface during polishing. Werecently have obtained polishing compounds with metallic impurities reduced to1-10 ppmconcentrations, andarepolishing glass with them. Believing that surface-layer absorption limits damage thresholds, wealso have explored removing thesurface layer byvarious methods. Results have been largely discouraging, probably because themany processes forsurface-layer removal recontami nate orphysically aCO2laser beam wasscanned caused melting andvaporization thesurface than twotimes the16J/cm^ hasbeen observed.

Although fractured surfaces would appear tobethelogical beginning ofdetailed surface interaction studies, clearly additional work isrequired tocharacterize fractured surfaces. If, inaddition, thecause ofthese stack (QWS) creates astanding-wave electric field distribution which has a large maximum outside thecoating andthen alternating substrate interface isvery weak. This field distribution accounts forthefact that HR coatings normally damage atthefirst orsecond layer interface. Wehave found that Alarge intheovercoat layer.

Thebreakdown phenomenon that isreported work isthesame process that hasbeen called \"intrinsic\" damage byother workers. Measurements were conducted with pulsed (31to140nsec), simple spatial mode lasers atwavelengths of10.6, 3.8, 2.7, ym. Theresults indicate breakdown isalikely forlaser-induced failure inthese materials over thewavelength range studied. Forsmall focal volumes, volumes smaller than breakdown fields decrease with increased laser frequency. Forlarge focal volumes, the free electrons initially present inthecrystal initiate thebreakdown, and thefrequency dependence isdetermined bytheelectron-phonon relaxation time. Thus, forlarge focal volumes, thelaser-induced breakdown fields increase with increasing laser frequency. From these results itisclear that crystal defects andimpurities play animportant role inwhat hasbeen called \"intrinsic\" damage. Asthis breakdown techniques forincreasing thelaser damage resistance ofhighly transparent materials. Threshold measurements were made onspecimens from three different classes ofmaterial purity atfour laser wavelengths 3.8, 2.7, and1.06 ym)andthree different crystals atdiffer- entfocal volumes were used toestablish empirical scaling laws forthebreakdown fields of these materials. These scaling laws were then applied todetermine thedamage threshold as a.function offrequency for thelaser damage thresholds decrease with decreasing wavelength, while inthelimit of large focal volumes (volumes greater than 10_ltcm-3),thelaser damage thresholds increase with decreasing wavelengths.

There areseveral plausible physical arguments that could explain observed size dependence, andthese are examined inturn inthediscussions that follow.

Forlarge spots requiring high total power, thespot size dependence would have saturated ataquadratic dependence. Higher threshold specimens would have shown this quadratic dependence forthesmallest spot sizes. Exactly theopposite type behavior was observed inthese experiments. Asthefocal spot sizes were increased ,thedependence of threshold intensity onthefocal-spot radius decreased and insome cases disappeared.
