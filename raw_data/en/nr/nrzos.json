Feeling out of balance? Balance your energy Change your life Energy healing is the medicine of the future... ... and the future is NOW! Your body knows what it needs to balance and restore, whether you are recovering from injury, coping with chronic illness, going through life transitions or simply need a tune-up. We offer intuitive, personalized sessions that combine [Reiki,](/reiki) [Craniosacral Therapy](/craniosacral-therapy) and [Therapeutic Massage](/massage) to help you achieve your wellness goals. The New Science, with concepts from quantum physics like non-locality, entanglement, and zero point field, is giving us a framework to understand how energy healing can happen from a distance. Clients tell us that receiving [distance energy healing](/distance-healing) is powerful, sometimes even more than a hands-on session. Perhaps it is because we can go right to the heart of an issue, release energy blocks and promote deep healing. And, you can relax in the convenience of your home! Homes and workplaces can hang on to the energies and emotions of the people who live and work there. Clearing those energies can help you move forward in more creative ways. It's helpful to schedule a clearing when moving into a new place, going through life transitions, or after stressful situations. You could think of it like getting your carpets cleaned regularly. Realtors have found that homes sell more quickly and easily when the energy is clear and inviting. If you're new to meditation, we have some free guided ones to get you started. They are infused with reiki and the healing music of the Gong. If you already have a meditation practice, give us a listen. They are available on the [Resources](https://www.innerbalance-healing.com/resources) page, on my [ YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbWGQ8klLRKeAfENlHMktuA/featured), and on the meditation app [Insight Timer](https://insig.ht/YjNtjpvN36). We are also introducing [Personalized Meditations](https://www.innerbalance-healing.com/personalized-meditation) that are created just for you. Give yourself or a loved one a unique gift that supports healing, connection and peace. Reiki is easy to learn and fun to practice. We offer all levels of [Reiki training](/events-workshops).
