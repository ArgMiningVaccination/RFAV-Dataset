This allows the various substances to penetrate into the body's cellular tissues at a much higher concentration and helps the body to assimilate key nutrients where it matters most, deep in the cellular structures. Improve cellular metabolism, lower inflammation and help detox the body with IV therapies. Our medical director overseeing IV therapies is \"Certified in Chelation Therapy\" by the prestigious American College for the Advancement of Medicine (ACAM). We have three Registered Nurses on staff who specialize and administer our customized IV therapies. We offer a variety of customized intravenous (IV) treatments including: Myers Cocktail Named after the late Dr John Myers, MD, a pioneer in IV nutrient therapy, the original formula has undergone several changes but the essential mix remains the same and the Myers cocktail is still the benchmark recipe for IV therapies. The Myers consists of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and vitamin C, is great for overall energy and immune support, and has been found to be effective against acute asthma attacks, migraines, fatigue, fibromyalgia, acute muscle spasm, upper respiratory tract infections, chronic sinusitis, seasonal allergic rhinitis, cardiovascular disease, and other disorders. High dose Vitamin C Vitamin C (ascorbate, ascorbic acid) is a major water-soluble antioxidant that also increases collagen production, is important for proper immune cell functioning, plays key roles in L-Carnitine synthesis, cholesterol metabolism, cytochrome P-450 activity, and neurotransmitter synthesis. High dose IV vitamin C (IVC) makes it possible to achieve blood levels up to 100x higher than possible with oral supplementation, which allows rapid restoration of vitamin C in body tissue. IVC is found to be beneficial for boosting immune function, recovery from surgery and illness, and published case studies report anti-cancer efficacy, improved patient well-being, and decreases in markers of inflammation and tumor growth. We follow the \" [Riordan Protocol](https://riordanclinic.org/research-study/vitamin-c-research-ivc-protocol/)\" when treating patients with cancer as the Riordan Clinic Research Institute (RCRI) has been researching the potential of intravenous vitamin C therapy for over thirty years. Their efforts have included in vitro studies, animal studies, pharmacokinetic analyses, and clinical trials. Glutathione Glutathione is known as the \"mother of all antioxidants\" for good reason. It reduces the amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress in the body while regenerating other antioxidants such as Vitamin C and E. It also turns down the expression of inflammation provoking genes. Just about every chronic illness, as well as normal aging, is associated with lowered glutathione levels. Patient's often follow the Myers infusion with glutathione for an extra boost. Alpha-Lipoic Acid Another potent anti-oxidant, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a fatty acid found in the body's producers of cellular energy, the mitochondria. It has shown benefit for various forms of oxidation and inflammation. These effects protect against heart diseases, liver diseases, diabetes, and neurological decline associated with aging. Amino Acids Amino acids are basic building blocks used in the body to build proteins, such as muscle and other tissue, and they also serve as precursors to neurotransmitters. Humans utilize 20 amino acids and 9 of those are called \"essential\" because we can't synthesize them and they must be obtained from our diet. Amino acid therapy may be used to treat a variety of conditions, including Parkinson's disease, restless leg syndrome, anxiety, depression, attention deficit disorder, addictions, migraines, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, and more. NAD NAD is short for Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide. NAD is derived from vitamin B3 or niacin and is essential for cells to make energy. When a hydrogen atom (H) is attached NAD is converted to active NADH. By then contributing the hydrogen to react with oxygen NADH helps generate energy stored in a chemical form known as ATP or adenosine triphosphate. ATP is fuel for the body, especially heart and skeletal muscle, and brain function. Low NAD is associated with numerous conditions including chronic fatigue, weakness and pain, drug and alcohol addiction, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and chronic diseases in general. NAD given intravenously is a powerful way to restore cellular energy systems, increase energy, and relieve mood disturbances, pain, and addiction. Chelation of heavy metals Toxic heavy metals, especially lead, cadmium, mercury, and arsenic, are common waste products in the environment and have documented potential for serious health consequences. These metals are considered systemic toxicants that are known to induce multiple organ damage, even at lower levels of exposure, and they are also classified as human carcinogens. Chelation comes the Greek word for \"claw\" meaning \"to grab\" which is what chelating agents do with heavy metals that are bound to the body tissue. A chelating agent binds stronger than the body tissue thus pulling some of the metal out of the tissue from whence it can be safely eliminated. A series of IVs can be given to aggressively remove heavy metals from the body. Chelation for artery health Chelation has been used by clinicians for decades to improve artery health. Conditions such as heart disease and peripheral artery disease are observed to improve with chelation therapy. Beyond clinical experience, with clinical trials and anecdotal evidence of benefit, the landmark Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT) study was the largest ever randomized controlled trial to show benefit for artery disease. In the TACT study, the chelation treatment reduced the recurrent cardiac events in diabetic patients by 41 percent, the number of heart attacks by 50 percent and deaths by 43 percent over five years.
