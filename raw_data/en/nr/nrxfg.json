Here's what's happening in our world today -- an enormous amount of people are aware about the importance of raising their spiritual vibration. Many of us realize that we're not some powerless beings and victims of life, but rather creators of our own worlds and reality. As soon as we are born into this disconnected world, it begins to mould us, separating us from our true expanded nature and limiting many aspects of ourselves. Right from our childhoods, we get given the foods and drinks that lead to ill health and disease, we're sent to schools that suppress our true creative selves, then most people choose jobs that pay the bills, but don't serve their higher purpose and so it continues. The kind of conscious change we are talking about is a shift in your understanding of yourself, your self-worth, your lifestyle and the world around you. When you begin to pay attention to your lifestyle, diet, thoughts, behavioural patterns and inner feelings, and start to question the accepted cultural/societal norms, the shift in consciousness occurs. How To Raise Your Spiritual Vibration With More Raw Foods We've now been on a diet influenced conscious journey for 11 years and we've experimented with many different spiritual practices, healing modalities, personal growth tools, diets and cleansing methods. The biggest shift in our life happened when we switched to a fruit-based raw food diet. My (Yulia) health issues started to balance very quickly, including Candida, hypoglycemia, chronic fatigue, hormonal issues and depression. When you eat your natural diet that is fruit based - it's light on your body, it's high in it's water content, it's got lots of sun energy, it's easy for your digestive system and it's purifying and healing for your health and your consciousness. Instead of a large amount of your energy going to your stomach to digest complex meals, all that extra energy is available to you to do other things. You experience a heightened state of consciousness and your mind becomes very clear. In the end, meditating when you have a headache, stomach ache, aching joints or a heavy body is a lot more challenging when compared to the quality of meditation in a light, healthy and raw plant-powered body.
