Since the arrival of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, new questions have emerged about how science can rally to harness future medical breakthroughs for cancer. mRNA vaccine technology shares similarities with targeted anticancer therapies. Therefore, key lessons from this pandemic could apply to the development of an infrastructure that could mean earlier cancer interventions. Dr. Maurie Markman, President of Medicine & Science at Cancer Treatment Centers of America, sat down with CancerNetwork\u00ae to discuss mRNA vaccines, what we can learn from the development of these products for COVID-19 prevention, and how these lessons can apply to cancer therapies. This segment comes from the CancerNetwork\u00ae portion of the MJH Life Sciences Medical World News\u00ae, airing daily on all MJH Life Sciences channels. "}
