Vaccine Injury Prevention Program Testimonials From Practitioners \"I recently completed the VIP course given and I have to say I was very impressed! The protocol she developed is incredibly well researched and thorough. I truly believe it covers all the bases in regards to healing the damage that vaccines can inflict on the human body. As a Homeopath, my hope is that my clients will choose to avoid vaccination whenever possible. However if they choose to or are forced to do so, I feel much more confident that I can help them mitigate a serious injury if this program is implemented correctly. I believe that I have a very valuable service that I can provide for my clients during these challenging times. I highly recommend that you learn this program and teach your clients how to use it if the need arises.\" (Elena Pollard, Homeopathic Practitioner, Colorado, CO November 2020) __________________ Vaccine Injury Prevention Program Testimonials From Parents \"Thank you so much for all of your help making me aware of vaccine dangers! I really appreciate it more than I can ever express!!! (Professional Mom of 1, Louisiana, USA, Fall 2020.) __________________ \"I am a huge proponent of homeopathy - I have been using it for myself and children for the past 7 years. My sons and I have some existing health issues and so I was extremely concerned about needing to vaccinate my 12 year old son for school. We had already followed the vaccine schedule (prior to learning about homeopathy) and did not realize that a lot of their health issues were due to those vaccines. You can imagine my concern in exposing them to even more vaccines. Luckily, I found this website through a friend whom had worked with them through a protocol. We followed the protocol that was given, which was extremely comprehensive, for his 2 vaccines of Menactra for Meningitis and Adacel for TDaP. He has not experienced any negative side effects at this point and he received the vaccines 2-3 months ago. We are now starting the Vaccine Detox Program for the previous vaccines and will also do several other detox protocols including ones for antibiotics and steroids, which was used for asthma caused by the vaccines. I cannot thank the Practitioner enough for providing the solution I have been looking for, for years! (Michele, Mother of 2 children, Pennsylvania, USA, October 2019.) __________________ I had learned a great deal about homeopathy over the years, but only was aware of simple protocols following vaccines to prevent injury, such as Thuja. This did not prevent my daughter from having a seizure after her 3rdDtap shot and I then delayed continuing with vaccination until the laws changed in California requiring vaccination for school. She then received the MMR shot and also had a strong reaction with adverse side effects and I found information about VIP program. She was able to go through the Vaccine Detox Program for the reaction to the MMR shot as well as a detox from the steroids she had used due to asthma and recurring chest infections which developed after vaccinating. Since going through these protocols, her asthma has almost completely cleared and I have felt safe enough to continue with the mandatory vaccines required for school in California under guidance. We began the VIP program and she has received 2 doses of Polio with no side effects. I have searched high and low for a homeopathic protocol to assist with tolerating vaccines as well as detoxing from prior shots and this program has been a lifesaver for us. We are so grateful to have found this remarkable VIP protocol to follow after vaccination as well as the detox program. We plan to continue with the Detox Program from antibiotics, as she had recurring infections - ear and chest - after vaccinations, to help with her allergies and gut health. We also will follow the VIP protocol for all the remaining shots required to attend school in CA. (Kathryn, mother of 1, Los Angeles, CA October 2020.) "}
