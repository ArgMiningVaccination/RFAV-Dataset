It has been known since the discovery of the biological role of NO in the 1980s, that supplying NO donors such can have many beneficial effects in different conditions by stimulating stem cells and modulating the immune response, however, there also exists a substantial risk of side-effects with long-term use. Excess NO can inhibit mitochondrial metabolism by binding to cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and can also produce reactive nitrogen species (Peroxynitrite) by interacting with reactive oxygen species (ROS). To avoid these potential damaging side-effects we propose to combine the use of NO donors with four additional components. Initially, we believe that the addition of antioxidants such as Thiols, Polyphenols and Vitamins can neutralize ROS and RNS. Secondly, we believe that application of appropriate wavelengths and dosages of light (blue, red or near infrared depending on the exact condition being treated) will dissociate NO from CCO (and other storage sites) thus restoring mitochondrial ATP production and stimulating healing in many situations. Thirdly, we think detoxification will remove the pathological free radical generators and increases the nitric oxide bioavailability Lastly, by delivering electrons to the body through electrotherapy, we might help to saturate the free radicals with electrons, thus eliminating underlying oxidative stress, stabilizing mitochondria, preventing further formation of pathological free radicals and increasing the nitric oxide bioavailability. This combination therapy may be applied to treat and prevent large variety of oxidative stressed related diseases such as degenerative diseases, immunological diseases, chronic infectious diseases, cancers and a broad range of unmet medical needs involving chronic inflammation with an emphasis on pain management. info@nitromedicine.comSalaheldin Halasa CEO,Nitromedicine, USA "}
