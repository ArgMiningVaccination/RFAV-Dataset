If we are being very restrictive with the scope of this definition. then we could caD nutrition the study of those inputs that go in via the mouth. 1.1 What do most people know about Food and Health? Most people have only the crudest of ideas on this topic. A great many have never received any proper education about it Younger people. as part of the National Curriculum, now receive a minimal outline at school but along wholly orthodox lines. and such ilstruclion often appears to be soon forgotten. The current culture does not favour the widespread application ofwhat nutritional knowledge is available to people. So many. if not completely uninterested in the subject, are generally restricted to conversation about one food or another being either .good or bad for you\u00b7 and whether or not it is a good idea to take some vitamins. Perhaps if you were to take the top 10% slice of the population with regard to education. intelligence and/or interest in nutrition you would find a more informed picture. Then you are among people who may begin to appreciate why fresh fruits and vegetables are favourable. why organic growing is worth considering and some may be vegetarians. Nonetheless. the vegeIatians may or may not understand why, apart from ethical reasons, larger scale meat eating may be negative for health. Also. there are a great many quite poor vegetarian diets. Meat eating is justone issue of many. Knowing why particular dietary measures are good or bad requires that you should understand in fair detail hOIIll' the various foods and nutrients interact with the human body. This requires at least a modicum of knowledge of human physiology. People are surprisingly ignorant of the workings of the body and where specific organs are located. You cannot expect people to have absorbed information that they are poorly prepared to undersland. Nonetheless. it is quite possible to give people simple guidelines for good nubition that they can understand wiIhout any physiological knowledge. There are some quite adequate and simple books to do this but only a small minority read them. Books that advocate quite freakish or specialised diets thalleave people not knowing upon which authors to rely also complicate the picture. Ofcourse. when people develop health problems. particularly when they spontaneously develop internal chronic problems, then we can recommend the professional nutritionist O'lVU PAGES.1 FOLDER OPE SECTION B These professionals, whom we train, often become very busy indeed. However. a great majority of the populace do not know that such professional help is available. If they do, they cannot yet see the need to visit an expert simply because they do not have enough knowledge to perceive the ooique value of the experfs speciality. Today at a guess. we possibly have about 5% of the people who are quite interested in their nutrition and its relation to healh and 95% who are, as yet, stiR most unaware. This is despite the various govemment-5f)OOsored campaigns of late to promote healthy eating and attack the growing problem of obesity. particularly amongst the young. The more perceptive of the 5% are aware that nutrition plays a determinatNe role in the nation's health and some win aetuaBy campaign to give nutrition a higher profile in the nation's life. 11.2II.I What do Doctors know about Food and Health? ~ Today we are faced with a vast scientific literature, contributed by scientists across lhe globe, demonstrating through reported research the efficacy of foods or nutrients in either preventative medicine or in clinical medicine. Yet when our patients (ie the patients of nutritional medicine practitioners) face their doctors across the desk and ask. -do you think nutrition could help mer or even -should I see a nutritional practiIionerT' the dodor is often much less than supportive. Damning with faint praise or outright disapproval are common responses. Some of the more liberally minded may actually go along with using a nutritional approach, while failing to understand that natural treatment and orthodox treatment are founded upon opposite principles. Few of these doctors have any experience at all of nutritional medidne in clinical practice. They therefore tend 10 dismiss the proven antive powers of nutrition. In those cases where a medical practitioner adopts the use of nutrients in practice. helshe often does SO with extreme selectivity. For example, the prescribing of calcium or iron is very common indeed. whereas zinc, manganese and duomium rareJy come into the picture.. There are strong (and entirely scientific) reasons for not supplementing single nmeraIs without regard to the others. So we have widespread application of incomplete knowtedge. In contrast to the rest of their profession, just a few doctors have engaged in the practice of nutritional medicine. That. in itself. is fine, though it is our experience that they are rarely whoIistic in their methods of practice. Moreover. when they do this. they tend ID want 10 reserve this area of practice just to 1hemselves, failing to acknowledge the existenee d the much more significant numbers ofwhoIistic non-medical practitioners. 1.3 What do Orthodox Dieticians know about Food and Health? , Dieticians working in the National Health Service and private clinics and hospitals are usually well trained in the basics of the subject, though they too have an entirely orthodox slant By and large they seem 10 accept the general view of most of the medical profession that nutrition does not affect iDness much. Hence. they restrict themselves 10 designing diets requRcl by the doctors for whom they work -usually for specified narrow purposes. such as low fat diets. ,PAGEIl2 OlW FOlDER ONE SECTION B low sodium diets etC. Such diets are, indeed, important in the hospital management of certain diseases (once these have become established) but they represent extremely limited horizons. Much that is in the basic and essentiallJaining of alternative nutritional practitioners is missing from the training of dieticians. As a result, most hospital diets are not very good for health. judging from the parameters that will be setdown in the following Sessions. 1.4 Relationship to Science and the Limitations of Orthodox Methods On one very important level, nutrition is a scientific subject. Science has furnished us with all the data we have about what nutrients are, which ones are essential and how much of them we need. Yet nutrition can unfortunately become a slighUy 'dry' subject if that is all thefe is. Yet in recent times science has also furnished us with access ID biochemistry and this enabtes us to understand exactly how the nutrients interact with the body processes. With this dimension added, the subject becomes a itde more complex, yet at the same time enthralling. However, the subject of Wholistic Nutrition transcends the area of human understanding for which science, alone, is appropriate. The reason is that it is 'yitaistic'*. It recognises the presence. in all life forms including the human body, of subtle (or 'etheric') energy forces not easily measurable by the physicist's eqUipment. It shares that position with the 'energy medicine' disciplines SUCh as homoeopathy, traditional acupuncture and spiritual healing. It follows an approach to those subtle energies that is embodied in the discipJine and philosophy of naturopathy. That is why naturopathic* principles are a key part of Sessions 1 &2 of this Course. The AIIemaIive ApproachID Nutrition It is WiSe to pause at this point to insert the definition of two very important concepts, which wit be used in this course over and CNer again. These are \u00b7Vitalistrf and \u00b7NaturopathY-. Vitalism is the notion that life in living organisms is sustained by a vital principle that cannot be explained in terms of physics and chemistry. This vital principle, often called '\"the life force-is something quite distinct from the physical body and is responsible for much that happens in health and disease. \" Naturopathy is a relatively modem term for an ancient concept (dating back to II 400 Be). This concept embraces the notion that the body is inherently self- . heanng and that it is the practitioner's job to stimulate and support this I process. Each patient is recognised as having a unique ife experience and a unique genetic iMeritanoe. AI diseases are seen as one and as altempts by the body to purify igeIf of toxins. TrealJilent focuses on causes rather than on symptoms and always addresses the whole ~ person. The wise words of Hippocrates (often called the Father of Medicine) express some of ~ the main tenants ofnaturopathic thought. He said: I ~ -It is only nature that heals and wherever and whenewr possible natIII'e should be given the opportunity CD do so. ~ Disease is only an expression of PUrification. ~ All elsease is one. ~ Let food be your medicine and medic8Ie be your food.\" FOLDER 0tE SECTION B These concepts provide a framework through which to observe and draw conclusions about the subtle energies that animate the human being. They serve to define important featwes of the ways in which these energies behave. Understanding that behaviour and observing and monitoring it during a person's illness and dUring the course of the nutritional treatment provides a unique key, or insight. into the patienfs recovery or response to treatment It simply is not good enough to view the human being as consisting ofjust a physical body. This level of insight is unique to 'alternative' nutritional approaches and the practitioner who works in this way enjoys a great enlivening of their work compared to working only on the material level. Hence, most 'alternative' nutritionists see conventional nutrition. as being rather rigid and unmoving. Hence. they also see it as very limited. This happens because orthodox nutritionists tend to be I~ into science alone. They fail to grasp the significance (or the reality of) the subtle energies and they reject the philosophy ofvitalism. It is generaly the view of 'alternative' nutritionists that understanding these things is a major step to healing the patient Orthodox science is well known to head down the route of specialism and detail. -Learning more and more about Jess and less-is the war it is often put. This can be commendable, but carried to the extreme, it can also be the opposiJe of whoIism (which, as the name suggests, takes into account the whole person, ie all mental, physical, emotional and spiritual aspects). Whilst both models are undoubtedly valid (and science brings us hard information about definite fads) if we lose sight of the \"whole person., then we Jose a really important dimension of our medical understanding. This even appties in respect of purely material issues. The giving of high levels of sUppJementary iron, whilst being unaware of likely damage to the body status in zinc and manganese, represents the lack of another sort of wholism at the purely chemical level. Adopting this approach blinkers the vision and fails to provide scope for thinking laterally -often regarded as an essential element of the 'alternative' outlook. 1.5 The Pressure of the Orthodox model Almost everyone who takes steps towards 'altemative' medicine experiences a backlash from others around them who have not been able to make the same conceptual change. PatienIs wanting to settle into an 'alternative' approach can be subject to negativity from their doctors (and as a result many patients do not ask the doctor's opinion). But students and practitioners aJite are frequently subjed to negative expressions and even frank hostility from relatives who can understand only orthodox. symptomatic treatment It is therefore best to be forewarned that your adherence to 'alternative' principles will be tested in these ways. At the ouIseI. Jack of knowledge may make one vulnerable to negativity, so students need to try 10 be strong in this area. Later on increased knowledge gives the power of counter-argument and confers more confidence. 1.6 The Body Consists of what has been Eaten It is advisable never to lose sight of this ultimate Jogk:al argument The diet is the only source from which the body can draw its materials. It has some ability, during digestion and FOLDER 0tE SECTION B absorption, to select favourable from unfavourable substances. However, it is inevitable that if the intake of substances is grossly out of balance and contains far too much of the unfavourable materials, then the internal composition of the body cannot do other than change in an unfavourable way. If that did not adversely affect the way in which the body processes work, then it would be a miracle. The orthodox argument that food and nutrients do not affect health is cleariy a false belief. lis refutation does not rest just upon the experience of individuals because such a wealth of scientific and medical literature exists to demonstrate the opposite. 1.7 Distinguishing between Palliation and Treating the Causes The classic 'alternative' viewpoint about. the basis of orthodox medicine is that it treats only symptoms and the disease manifestatiOns, not the fundamental cause. Moreover, it is seen that orthodox medicine treatments are designed to 'contain' the i.ness symptcms. This 'mnlainmenf is termed 'paliative' or 'palfiation'. It consists of making the illness easier to bIs. Painkillers make life easier for the sufferer. They do nothing whatever to remove or correct the causes of the pain. In some cases they are known to make those causes worse. Giving insulin to the diabetic may control, and hence palliate, a very difficult high blood sugar problem but it does nothing to correct the pancreatic insufficiency that lies at the root of the problem. Removing gallstones and the ganbladder with it, palliates the pain arising from the gaIsIDnes. In one sense it can also be seen as removing the cause too, since the stones are the direct cause of the pain. However, the sense or 'palliation' is stil there, because the reason why the gaUstones fanned in the first place has not been addressed. The fundamental reason why the gallstones form has to do with poor liver function, which results in poor quality bIe, and this is true whether you view the matter naturopathically or biochemicaDy. In gallstDne disease the more enlightened solution is to encourage better liver function. We all recognise that there are many instances when it is too late to apply that solution. The reasons for this have to do with the lack of preventative mecflCine and the general tendency only to act upon correcting metabolic errors When they have progressed too far. The alternative approach to diabetes is 10 encourage the production of the patienfs own insulin to start again. We all recognise thai: there are times when, through Ute constant use of insulin over many years, the insulin producing eels of the pancreas have died out and obviously cannot be resuscitated. Again. the lack of preventative medicine -or 'early detection' medicine -is to blame. There are strong measures available in nuIritional practice to counter adult diabetes and to have major impacts even upon diabetes appearing in childhood, just as various published works have shown. In joint pain, whilst it has to be recognised that often pain has to be alleviated, that again happens only because the process of joint deterioration has been allowed to go too far. The emergency has to be dealt with, though. of course it would hcNe been better avoided. The point is that the 'alternative' approach, which falls within the definition of 'whorlSm'. is always drawn in these circumstances to more than just a palliative, anti-inflammatory, approach. Rather, the emphasis oftreatment is placed upon rebuilding the damaged joints. It is, therefore, the palrlation aspect and the absence of measures to promote tissue repair that characterise orthodax medicine, combined with a complete denial of the very existence of the e1W PAGEB.5 The Memalive ApproachID NuIrIion FOLDER ONE SECTION B subtle energies and the life force. The toxic or inhibitory nature of orthodox medicine remedies also makes a significant contribution to the difference between orthodoxy and the 'alternatives'. This goes along with an outlook upon the causes of disease that is generaly at variance with the 'alternative' view of causes. Taking a stomach disorder as an example, i orthodoxy may say that the 'cause' is over-secretion by the stomach, or the cause is 'inflammation'. It is that thinking that leads to presaibing paDiative remedies. The real causes are always more basic. Something must have caused the stomach to over-secrete or must have caused the inflammation, 'Altemative' medicine always seeks the ultimate cause. One esteemed teacher of the subject said \"When you first study for your qualification I will1each you to find the cause, but in higher study I Will teach you to find thecause ofthe cause offt cause\u00b7, The alternative argument thus goes as follows: because, in orthodox medicine, the fundamental concepts of the causes of disease are wrong, the remedies applied by oonventional medicine are usually deIrimen1al to the Life Force. The question of the tDxiciIy of the remedies is also a major consideration. Their chemistry differs widely and the toxicity of different drugs vanes across a wide range. However, in general. the more effec:tive these remedies are, the more toxic they are and hence the more detrimental to the Life Faroe. Since orthodox practitioners do not recognise the existence of the life Force, they do not look for it and have no means of gauging its health or otherwise. \" Hence, across most of the population orthodox practitioners, even for quite minor symptoms, are applying toxic chemical remedies regularly, frequently and. it seems \"at the drop of a hat\". The problem is that the life Fon:e is being left more inhibited after each inhibitory treatment This is reputed to \u00b7drive the disease deeper\", and we sha. see more clearly as we proceed ii ..at that means. The fajo..:re to address the underlying problem is absoll.\"teIy the nub d the :: problem. The perception of most 'altemative' practitioners is that patients are sent inIo a downward spiral of in health by repeated use of chemical medicines and other measures in allopathic practice that inhibit the life Force. The result is escalation in the incidence of Iserious chronic diseases that could and should have been prevented in the first place. ~! READING: Please read lindlahr p18-22 !2 THE LIFE FORCE \"21.. . What does our Energy Consist of? 'i II AI the root of most whoIistic therapies lies the belief that all fife is animated by a subtle force. II II We call this the life Force. You either believe it or you do not It cannot exactly be proved at the moment and the belief is not in accord with the yardsticks that we call 'scientific', The belief is a IiI!Ie akin to the beief in God or in spiri!s or ghos1s, and yet at the same time I is not, because the life Force is by no means so remote from us. It is not necessarily difficul for an agnostic to accept the life Faroe. The writer was once asked for a definition of the Life Force and wrote: \"The Life Fcne is dut IR forms and dismguishes them from non-Iving matter. It Is seen as a determining PMEU OlW FOLDER ONE SECTION B Force, not as a mere accornpanimem to the phenomenon of Life. That is, it deumtines whether Ufe can exist of not: it delennines the physical form that a nre form takes: by Its quality and its strength it determines the health, vigour and lIiaIty of the Ife form. Hence it determines om- freedom from, or our smcepdJlily to illnesses, and our geneJ'3I ability to come IhrougfI and to ~r I fran Life's stresses and traumas.\" I The Life Force concept is fundamental to Western Naturopathic thinking, in which the strength I\" of the Life Force is seen to be a crucial factor determining patterns of heallh and disease. The i aspect of philosophy, which lies behind such therapies, is termed -Vitalism- (as defined I earlier). I The life Fon:e There is, of course, a whole literature available on this topic. \u00b7It is non-scientific work, some of II it by possibly gifted 'seers', some of it -by investigators who feel sure they perceive some . shades of the Life Fon::e emanating through its interactions with various forms of physical I mailer. There is no absolute need to pursue that literature, but it is there for those who are : aIIracted to it In this sectiOn we simply quote what some of the influential writers have said about it This will give something of the 'feel' of the subject Miner & Smart (1976) deduce that all matter on earth is accompanied by -etheric energy\"', even inanimate \"'..atIer. They suggest the e:xistence of four differe. ..,t levels of such energy that are associated with differing levels of physical matter and physical energy. The highest is the wlife elheric force\", ie the Life Force. The earth-bound human is only able to perceive this energy indiredly. Ail the different etheric forces are seen as influencing and associating with physical maUer. but the low etheric energies do so more directly. The Iife-etheric force has m act thr9Ugh these lower energies to exert any effects upon the physical level. This book is a compencium of experiments concerned with the ways in which the etheric energies express 1hemseIVes through the medium of physical matter. These considerations seem to mean that the life Force as such is very close to the earth, not far removed from the physical level. The belief in sublle energies is akin to religious conviction, ie it is not scientifically provable. Yet II these energies are very close indeed to the level of our everyday lives. Watson (1974) approached the matter by considering in detail the nature of death. That is, indeed, one route into the problem in theory, because explaining death should throw light upon lie. Perceiving that the individual cells of the body could 'live' to a degree after the death of the person or aninal, he proposed that they were in an intermediate condition, 1aIting the view that there were actually three states, life, death and the ~between state, 'goth'. However. he found the relationship d the subtle energy fields to the personaity intriguing. He goes on: -There is 00 irrefutable sdentific evidence for an aIternati\\Ie system to the f.mDiar sonudc one, but 1IIe discovery of Ire fields suaesu that we have by no means explored all the po55ibi1ides. the prevalence and consistency of out-of\u00b7body experiences suggest that separacion in space may weD be poIliibIe. There is nothing in biology that denies dIis possiI)rJty, and much Ihat could be simply and logically explained by the exiKence of a relatively independent second system. 000 FOlDER ONE SECllON B We Jcnow that tIssociation within the body and brain is of conunon occurrence, and It seems there is no valid reason for setting spatial and temporal limits to the process.\" l1le postulale of a subtle life Force makes a natural connection with such topics as out.o<Jf\u00ad body experiences. astral tJavel and even survival after death. This happens because the subtle life Force appears by its very nature to be -life within a different medium\" and if life can exist in a different medium, then why should it not exist quite independently of the physical body? You do not have to address such matters at all, though many doubtless will. or have already done so. During the person's life, or most of it, this life Force is seen as being very dOSely associated with the body. watson further writes: -Burr concluded that Ids field both determines and is determined by the OIplism with whkh it is involved. This reciprocal action fits well with the new qu~ mechanics. II The work of Burr being rvferred to concerns an electrodynamic field and win be referred to again below. Gerber in (1988) writes very extensively. indeed, on this topic. The foIowing passage. under the heading \"The Physico-Etheric Interface\" gives an indication of his thoughts: II... lhere is considerable evidence to suggest that there exists a hoIop'.1phic energy temPlate associated wiIh the physical body. This ed1eric: body is a body which looks quite simIar to the physical body 0\\'8\" which k is superimpmed. WIthin the etheric energftic map is carried infonnadon which guides the cellular growth of the physk;a1 stI'1J(:b.Ire of the body. It carries die $p3tIaI infonnadon on how the developing foeblS Is to unfold in utero, and also the struCbnl daL1 for growth and repair of the adult organism should damage or disease ocwr.\u00b7 i To assist with this whole concept we reproduce below a quotation from Finlay (1951). It ~ represents his concept and understanding of the life Force, but he does. we think. paint a!picture that is quite easily understood. In particular. he emphasises that it is a determi'lingi force. which. apparently, decides how it will employ matter for its own purposes -not just a '\" fon:e of energy, which accompanies a living organism . .-------~-----,: \"'What is the cause of a IRe in full bloom retaining its shape and Iits leaves, while another, whkh is called udead,\" breaks In pieces Iat a toUch and OlIIdJIes awq into dust? There must be a Isomed1ing, to which we give the tenn lIife,\" which animates the .Owing organism and is absent in the dead organism. That isomed1ing bas the power to give the subsrance fann and expression, whereas, when the something is absent, form and ppression go, and the substance which was previously aMnaed =-------' returns to fmn part of the earth. FOlDER ONE SECTION B Evidently, there is something we cannot see or handle, which is nevenheless real and powerful, besides having this faculty of aeating forms out of Inanimate earth. I say it must be powerful, because it is capable of raising matter\" apinst the fon:e of gravity, and retaining ~ in an e~ oositioo-l as, when it leaves the substance, the force of gravity again assumes control and the substance in question is affected by all die forces of nature. A man, an animal, a tree, can srand erect when I:his life force permeates them, but when it does not they fall to die crouncL Life, therefore, is an ~g fOKe which can counteract the Imdency in matter to dimr-g;mise kself. ure is a formative, thinting force, entering matter and arranging ~ whereas matter without it is inert and void of penonality. Ute, therefore, cannot be a part of matter any more than the potter can be a part of the day he uses in his moulds, and besides this, it has personality. [wry living' thing has personality, because every thing alive is cIffetent from every odter living thing. This fife force, by dBs process of MJUinI.. 1m powers quite beyond the powers attributed to matter. It is more powerful than mauer, it can orpnise matter, and themore things. Besides that: it has individuarny. ConsequemIy we can safely take a funfJer step forward, and say thai: this Olgalising force is innu.ced by M'1IId and that what we call M\"md must be die living, active, dominating, controlling force in the Universe. M\"md controls life and Ute controls matter. Death can therefoR! be described as a severance of Hind from Its association with matter, and it would be illogical to conclude d1at Mmd aid its Iife-expressing fthide, the etheric body, which have such power over matter, cease to exist when we lose siIht of their orpnising powers. Though we do not see Mind at wort, It is logical and reasonable to assume dIat what can control matter cannot be destroyed. These general argmnentS, had we not direct evidence, might never lead us to anything tangible. We might always be right in assuming the indestruetlJilty of Hind, and Its expJ mkm, Ute, but had psychic phenomena not come to our aid we would have been only halfway to OlD\" goaL The goal, however, has now been reached, and the path has been prepared for die human mind to tr3ftl the whole road. Whether Or not you fclow him down \"the whole road\". this passage certa8lty conveys the full nature of the Life Force as conceived by vitalists. 2.2 Evidence Concerning the Life Force Since our 'usual' human senses only work through the medium of the human body we can only expect to detect the Life Force. or other subtle forces, through their interactions with matter. It is dear that these interactions are themselves subtle and sensitive because one level. or state, is impinging upon another. It is postulated that they are not entirely of our world, not physical, only detectable with physical apparatus under special conditions. Often they are descnbed as -umtwhich science cannot see\". Not surprisingly, therefore. when investigators come forward. convinced that they have a phenomenon that demonstrates the Life Force. the physicists, e1W. FOLDER ONE SECTION 8 looking at it with a steely scientific eye, are not usually ready to accept the condusions claimed. Hence, we have several delicate phenomena that are often claimed to be manifestations of the life Force, yet not accepted as such scientifically.I ~ Some of the best examples of these are: !1 JII. The experiments done by Haroldsaxton performed on ~g and Homoeopathic Chinese 'energy pulses' at the human wrists. , i I These are not topics that you necessarily need to study. From experience it is dear that many 1 students wiD simply accept lhe Life Force as 'obvious'. Some will say they have always known about it. 0Ihefs are able to accept the concept now as a reasonable principle. Others perhaps (though we have ri1re1y corne across it) will n8V8f accept the Life Force. If that occurs, it seems a shame, for it removes some of the eccifement from whoIistic nutrition\" but it is nonetheless perfectly possible to proceed without this conviction. It is stiD even possible to follow the energy changes within the patient, but you have then to think in tenns of biochemical energy r.ather than subtte energy. Here, it is possible to offer just minor comments upon the sources of evidence cited above. 2.3 The Fields of Life Milner and Smart (1976) write: \u00b7Burr has found . ~ there are electromagnelic fields mociated with all &ving matter, from sfme mould up to man, which he caUs the L-fields (ure-fields). In trees the l-fleld shows a diurnal rhythm and a lunar rhythm: it varies with sunspot activity and varies with die aIJnQ5pheric and geophysical electrical acdvitY of iIs environment. The L-fields of seeds are rebted to their subsequent IfUIlIdt characteristics. /; Burr, (1972) also shows that disease patterns are associated with a certain deformation of the ~ L-fields that can be detected before any physical symptDms appear. The claim is made that !. the ovulation of the female. the effects of injury, the healing process and the advent Of ~ malignancy are all reflected in changes in the L4ields. 1 2.4 Kirlian Photography The technique of -high voltage photography'\" lhat displays fields-. has been named after Semyon and Valentina Ki1ian, who devoted much of their rIVes to studying it Notwithstanding that other workers had found the phenomenon before (Carsten, Navratil. Baraduc, Nikola Tesla), the Kirfians were eventually responsible for drawing it to wider aIlentiOn. The technique shows up a pattern of energy racrrating from human hands and feet, or a pattern of energy around cut leaves, that gradually fades with time after the leaf was PAqE;B.18 01W FOLDER OlE SECTION B separated from the plant It also shows brightly displayed energies emanating from live, fresh ij foods and next to nothing from processed. preserved and refined foods. The technique is famous for having shown up the -phantom lear effect.. If a leaf with many IeafleIs has one leaflet removed. it shows up the energy pattern of the missing Ieaftet The energy fBd of the leaflet, it seems, survives the excision of its physical form. References on this topic inckJde -The Unseen 5eIf' by Band M Snellgrove (1979) and -Psychic Discoveries behind the Iron Curtain- by S Ostrander & L SChroeder (1970). 2.5 Capillary Dynamolysis GapiIary dynamolysis is, as Milner & Smart put it -a simple method by which these shaping forces of plants can be freed and made manifesf. Solutions of plant sap or juice are allowed to permeaIe through a filter paper, mUted with or without a soluble inorganic salt, such as copper chloride. It would be expected that simple concentric rings would be formed. but insIead complex feathery and ferny patterns develop that are characteristic: of the plant or substance added. It is daimed that plants of the same family produce retated patterns and that the nature of any fertilizer used for growing the plant affects the pattern in disaete ways. The technique has been studied for investigating the quanty of a water supply. A version of Ihe method exists in which ayslallisation occurs. contributing to the patterns. This is alleged to provide a diagnosis of a person's health by adding a little of their blood to the crystallising solution. The contention is that in these techniques, whereas known physical forces 'A'OU1d provide only simple straight forward patterns, the intricacy of the patterns actually realised comes from the qualities of the Life Force associated with the living material that has been used. 2_6 Homoeopathic Effects Itis not unti Nutritional Medicine students have qualified and got into practice that they usually employ any homoeopathy as an adjunct to their therapy in anything oIher than a first-aid rofe. That is because homoeopathy is a complex training in lis CNIIl right and a quite separate cflSCipline. However, any demonstration of the effectiveness of homoeopathic medicines at potencies higher than 12C is evidence for the existence of the subtle etheric energies. Such remedies have been diluted beyond the point at Which the last traces of material substance. derived fmm the Mother tincture, have been removed, leaving only the residual energy associated with the origN! material. Today it is commonplace to have controlled clinical trials of homoeopalhic remedies carried out in pa.nuit of legal medicine licences. Many of these are fully successful in demonstrating the efticacy ofthe remedy for a particular ailment or symptom. However, this has been done mainly with lower potency mixed (or complex) remecies in which the 12C potency was not reached. Nonetheless it seems highly likely that the same mechanism was involved. since the maIeIiaI substance of the remedy present would have been vanishingly smaB. For examples of conIroIIed successful clinical trials of homoeopathic complex remedies see Zenner & Melelmann (1990), Claussen et aI (1984) and Salehian (1992). 01W The Life Fon:e FOLDER ONE SECT10N B 2.7 The Chinese 'Energy Pulses' at the human wrists These pulses that are subjectively 'measured', or rather, sensed, in Chinese medicine acoompany the blood pulse, yet are quite distinct from it, since they do not depend upon its volume or frequency. The variations in the quantity and quality of the 12 pulses are diagnostic in a detailed manner and change in very specific ways in response to needle treabnent or moxa. They are widely considered to be a manifestation of the life Force, referred to as the 'Chi'. In fact Chinese medicine recognises not one Life Force, but several, identified by individual Chinese names. If you wish to study this point further, please refer to Pulses and Impulses\u00b7 by Townsend & De Donna (1990). 2.8 General Reference to Subtle Energy Forces in Nature There are several books on\u00b7the subject of subtle energies in Nature. These do not necessarily have much specific relevance to nutrition, though some students may wish to fill themselves in on this as additionai background. These inciude such works as \"'Sensitive ChaoS' by Schwenk (1965) and \"Living energieS' by Coats (1996). 2.9 Toxic Effects upon the Life Force The Life Force is generally seen as an abundant ebullient and beautiful manifestation of Nature's energy. Although some fonns of acupuncture take in the concept of a fum of polluted Life Force called\u00b7AggressiVe Energy\", that idea is not shared much by other whoIistic disciplines. We are left for the most part with the idea of a rather perfect form of energy. In Western Naturopathic thought, the enemy of the life Foree is toxicity. The life Force inhabits a potentialy perfect physical body. The main threat to the integrity of that body consists of Ihe body's own metabolic wastes, if they are not properly cleared out. plus environmen1a1 toxins that gain access to the body from outside, or that are generated in the bowel. In that way the bowel gains a high level of importance in Naturopathy and '\"Nature Cure\". The Life Force, then, with its almost holy purity, is in danger of being inhibited. dampened down and threatened by what amounts to some entirely physical dirt that gains access to that I: 1ernpIe of the sou~ the human body. Whilst in Traditional Chinese Medil2le impurities in 1he ~. mind, emotions cw spirit are just as important as physical impurity, it is naturopathy that II focuses upon the actual physical sewers of the body. It does not seem quite right to set aside the toxins of the higher levels and we do not suggest that you should entirely do so. Nonetheless, nabJropathy and nutritional therapy inherently are set to work towards the higher teveIs through the physical, so that route of approach has to be accepted. we shall tum shortly to consider those toxins in some detail. The inability of naturopaths in the past to identify specific toxins or to point with sufficient exactitude to the ways in which theV can be removed. has been the Achilles Heel of the naturopaths in trying to represent their views in the past to orthodox doctors cw medical scientists. These things are changing today, as we shall see in due oourse. Toxicology and detoxification are becoming exactsciences and this is a process which has been going on for some time. ,,:lU2 OlW FOlDER ONE SECTION B Henry Lindlahr, whose book \"Philosophy of Natural TherapeuticS\", will be the subject of some ofthe sbJdent's first course reading, pinpointed this aspect of the subject as foRows. The three contributing factors to a worsening condition were: Jowered vitality abnormal composition of blood and lymph accumulation of morbid matter and poisons. Lowered vitality signifies a reduced Life Force. Abnormal composition of blood and lymph denotes abnormality of physiological function and imbalance. To have thiS happening in the blood and lymph almost certainly signifies abnormality offunction and imbalance in the tissues also. Finally, the reference to Mmorbid matter and poisons. is the nub of what we are dealing with here. The term \u00b7poisonsM is easily .understood, though the term \"morbid matter\" possibly signifies thallhe body is coping with dead tissue, dead cells and damaged cell constituents, such as chemicaly damaged proteins coming from damaged ce!!s. If so. this is certai.\"'lty accurate, since modem pathology recognises all these factors as being true components of tissue and cell damage and death. 1l1e ure Force. then. is seen as struggling to oppose these adverse events and their consequences, as a perfect essence grappling with the adversities of having been attached to a physical form that has defects. It isasif the job of the Life Force is continually to make perfect. whilst perfection is not in the nature of this world order. Burr (1972) thought that to some degree, the Life Field and the life form were interdependent and co-determined one another. Without detracting at all from this probable truth, most sources regard the Life Force as the higher element 2.10 Nubitional Effects upon the Life Force 2.10.1 Bulk nutrients The taking in of food is the nolB'ishmem. of course, of the physical body. At this point. you might well wonder Whether the Life Force is concerned in this process. But of course. it must be. The food itself, ifwe believe the evidence of Kirlian photography, is accompanied by some Life Force anyway. So the first concern is whether or not the food being taken offers any viIaIity to cOntrtbU1e to or to strengthen the Ufe Force ofthe human body. Next comes the consideration of the bulk nubients -the protein. carbohydrate and fat. These are our source of biochemical energy and we obviously staJve without them. Their purity is crucial. Ifthey have been chemically modified or damaged by 1Dxic interactions, then they wi' entrain toxicity and also be hard to break down. Even at best. their digestion and assimilation cosIs energy, which may well be both biochemjcal i!!d subtll!.. We have to consume a given amount. Consuming more than enough of these things is clearly debirnental on account of the energy cost of breakdown and the energy cosIs of disposal of the waste products that result from 1he excess. Moreover. there is reason 10 think that cells do not function well if loaded with surplus bok nulrients. e1W FOLDER ONE SEC110N B 2.10.2 Food intake costs energy Taking in food costs energy. Since food intake is essentiat, food is a necessary part d our energy balance, subtle and otherwise. However, !he negati'A impact upon e....erg/ of surplus nutrients is dear and, in particular, the negative effect upon energy balance of the most energy-demanding bulk nutrient -protein. A low pro1ein diet therefore helps the energy balance. This provides a relief from the energy expenditure of digesting and assimilating protein and then getting rid of the waste products. More energy can then be used for other activities. inctuding detoxification. For most people a spell on the rice cflet (not IIlOR! than 10 days), which is a low protein diet. or even a rice and vegetable diet, will free up energy for other uses. It may produce feelings of energy surge. By comparison, diets of the type so common today, loaded with high protein and fat, tend to exert negative effects upon energy and upon detoxification. TIlat is a basic tenet of naturopathic theory and practice. 2.10.3 The micronutrients When you practice nutritional therapy in a naturopathic setting, being aware at the same time ofthe on-going biochemisby, you become aiIicaUy aware of the role of the micronulrienls in a II way that the classical naturopaths were not. What we call the life Force must be ctoseIy linked into the biochemical energy systems of the body. As indicated above, anyone who found the ute Force concept 100 much to swallow could still practice nutritional medicine by focusing upon the heath of and the fluctuations in the biochemical energy systems. The micronutrients perfonn a number or roles in the body, but above an they are required to make enzyme systems work.. Or, to put It ano1her way, they are reqUired to make biochemical transformations work. Enzymes wil be disaJssed fully in later sessions and we wiD not pause to describe them now. However, it is important to know at this point that a very IitIIe d the important minerals win make a great cftfference to the biochemical activities of the body. 8iochemicar reactions win flow better when they are present in the conect balance. Therefore tt-.e minerals have a key interaction with the Ufg Fo.\"C8. Without the right minerals the life Foree can be conceived of as pushing forward to achieve high activity in the body, yet being blocked through the chemical composition not being correct. If you apply the minerals in this situation, there may, indeed. be a surge forward of the energy. That can be true whether you regard the matter as a naturopath and vitalist or as a biochemist. Minelals can 1Iieiefure release the life Force from inhibition and increase tissue activities. Some vitamins. especiaIy B Group vitamins, have some of the same effect. However, the tangible benefits of the vitamins are rarely so dramatic as in the case of the minerals. for reasons that will be seen in later Sessions. 2.11 Non-Material Effects upon the Life Force In addition to the toxic negative effects on the ute Force. most naturopaths and whoistic practitioners generally would PAG6 B,14 OTW FOLDER ON: SECTION B the Lie Force also. On the negative side, harrowing experiences, trauma, separation, bereavement cIearty afflict the whole person. The Life Force wanes or wins, it would seem. under the force of such even1s. Under those conditions, it is believed, detoxification slows down and mineral and other nutrient losses from the tissues may well occur. The health outlook fhen darkens. On the other hand, the experiences of joy and laughter probably have the reverse effects. So we must recognise that life events interact rather cJosely with the Life Force and never fan inlD the trap of regarding our patient as though he or she were a mechanism. life events have therefore, indirect nutritional effects. But. without any doubt, nubition can make us better suited to cope with life and provide a biochemically sound physical body for the ute Force to inhabit _READING: Please read Vlthoulkas p58 -86. \u00b7~r-------------------------~~ IiCheckpoint One a.

Nutritional Deficiency and Imbalance Toxic Attack These three factors. it is clear. are strongly associated with each other. If some causative fac10r afIIids the life Foree. then the defences that arise from the subtle forces are -dr:Mn-. Then nubients are lost and toxins aCQJmulate. If nutritional error or deprivation are the I'I'1OIe strongly implicated primary cause, then the Life Force struggles with an unbalanced physical body, getting the tissue biochemistry to wort: at full integrity is impossible; hence. the body's detoxification system becomes incompetent and the body's toxic burden may rise steeply. At the same time the life Force ails. So, focusing as we do now upon elimination of toxins (the very nub of classical naturopathy), we perceive that it is a process that depends upon a good strong Life Force and also upon adequate nutrient intake. Therapies that cfJredly stimulate the life Force (hornoeqJa1hy. awpundure and spiritual healing) therefore make an indirect. though real. contribution to toxic efimination through increasing the Life Fon:e or otherwise improving its health and balance. Changes to'Nards a toxin free Iifestyte, diet and environme.\"1t obviously have the effect of alleviating toxic input. These give the body more chance to increase its toxic output if it sm has the vitility to do so. But the ctassical naturopaths were always bound to be right that the ultimate ouroome of any confrontation between a human body and is toxic load would be determined by the ability to deIoxify. Above all that parameter needs to be optimised. If that does not happen, then we are usually headed upon a downward path. Although we will focus more clearly upon the toxic burden and toxicology later. at this point you do need to comprehend the implications of a failure to detoxify. As the toxic load increases. so does the mnsequent tissue damage. The first: eIfecIs comprise an impairment of biochemical function, .\" including the ability to produce cell energy. Indeed. this consiSts ofa slowing down of most d .. the key processes of metabolism. After that the cell membranes and other structures may become progressively damaged. The cells that comprise the living parts of the body tissues are normally in a constant state of repair and replacement, but accumulation of toxins leads to a loss of the abiJity to repair and replace faulty components. Eventualy this process leads towards necrosis. or cell death. Degenerating tissues contain many serni-moriJund cells. fully moribund ceds and dead cells_ Tissue activity has then to be performed by the remaining cells, which may also be biochemicaUy impaired. Different tissues become the prime targets of chronic destruction, dependent upon where the toxins accumulate. This is what is meant by the chronic condition_ It features a sluggishness. the presence of a toxic load, the inflicting of toxic damage. partial loss at least of specialised functions and progressive loss of the ability to seIf;epair. FOLDER ONE SECTJON B Examples are readily provided. The arthritis sufferer has impaired biochemistry and necrosis in his or her joints. For others it may be an endocrine gland that fails, giving diabetes. pancreatitis or Addison's disease. The location of the most intense degeneration depends upon other factors, which will be discussed IaIer in the course. The crucial point is that unless necrosis and degeneration can be stopped, there will be no recovery, no light at the end of the tunnel. The eventual outcome, of course. is deattt We aft face that anyway, but the point is that 10 permit ever increasing toxicity is either to head towards a much earlier death than is necessary or10 head toward a long speD of fife liVed in relative decrepitude. 3.2 The Idea of Elimination The idea of \u00b7fuming back\" from the spectre just described has become commonplace in aIIemative medicine circles. Bernard Jensen, the celebrated American naturopath, has cIearfy speIt out the options related to this in a Chart. Jensen's chart shows the human body heading downward, foIowing the line of a graph, through regions of reactive toxicity, exemplified by hay fever and eczema, towards darker regions of chronicity that end up in cancerous states. The German homoeopath, Hans Heinrich Reckeweg, who was clearly also a naturopath at heart. perceived six stages of toxification of human tissues. representing progressive steps in the acetITIUIation of a toxic load and of toxic damage. These stages will be reviewed as they are very signjfica1t in a clinical setting. Also, a popular type of book by Hampton (1993), caRed -The Way BacK, is about retracing steps from the abyss of chronic iUness, towards the brighter' prospects of better health. Whichever of the naturopathic writers you follow, the process requires the activation of the pathways of de1nXification. That means getting the toxins out of tissues in which they are lying. It may call for their biochemical transformation. It always calls eventually for transporting them ouIside the body. We now look at various proatSses Ihat are involved in deIoxification, not yet from the standpoint of a biochemist, but rather from that of the naturopath's. 3.3 Acute Conditions -Fevers, Crises, Inflammation and Hyperactivity You could take an attack of the common cold as an example. Let it be a realy acute one with streaming nasal disdlarge. The orthodox approach is to try to suppress the symptoms to make the subject more comfortable in the short term. The naturopath takes the view that the cold is an elmination of toxic waste products from the body and that it is therefore important not to inIerfefe with the eliminatory process. Slopping the discharge that is a part of the cold OlW \u00b7\u00b7v'r \"'~. FOLDER atE SECTION B would, according to naturopathic theory, result in toxins that the body was maq,g an effort to discharge, being retained within the body instead, where they would persist in doing harm. Nothing divides the orthodox outlook from the alternative more thoroughly than this particular disagreement Much the same can be said of acute red rashes on the sIOO. boils and carbuncles, and other outflows from many of the body orifices, be they through the bowel (eg.as diarrhoea), from the liver (as a blious attack, perhaps with nausea and vomiting), or from ears, mouth, nose, even the eyes, urinary passage or vagina. So ear infections with cischarge, thrush in the mouth, short, sharp attacks of cystitis and acute vaginal discharge all i fBI into this distinct category of -acute- conditions that do succeed in getting some foul malerial out ofthe body. It is difficult for people to accept at first that these unpleasant events and processes should reaDy be regarded as beneficial. The usual reaction of most people these days (for it is a time of instant solutions), is to request the doctor to prescribe a drug, if one is available, that wiD quash the symptoms and make the person more comfor1able for POW. The orthodox remedy is theletore Ikely to be an antibiotic for the infection or something to inhibit the produdiQn of surplus secretions. The true nature of what is going on in the patienrs body simply gets no attention either from patient or doctor. The idea of putting up with discomfort now in order to make oneself better in absolute terms afterwards is unpopular throughout the greater part of our society. However, education can Change this.JAI ~IREADING: Please read Lindthar p28 -41. I ! 3.3.2 Fevers i j Another unpleasant health event that natumpaths regard as beneficial in the longer run is a fever. The clear distindion between the chronic and the acute is whether tiSsUe actiVity is being stimulated or depressed. Sluggishness Characterises Chronicity: hypelactivity characterises the acute condition. In fever the temperature rises (by definition) and the pulse tends to quicken and deepen in volume, whle there is frequenUy redness in the face. 1be fever is therefore an 'all systems go' condition. The rise in body temperature and the enhanced flow of the circulation that accompanies it ensure that ceDular processes inaea5e. Oxygen consumption increases. To an approximation, the rates of chemical reactions tend to increase with inaeasing temperabJre, doubling for every 10 degree Centigrade rise. With enzyme reactions the effect may be greater. The surge in biochemical activity that resuIIs leads to a major increase in the tissue resources of energy and a greater ability ID synthesise necessary substances. Hence, the resources are being mobilised in fever to boIh repel invading organisms and also to detoxify and remove toxic substances. That role of a fever is not recognised in orthodoxy. Instead, medicines will often be administered that reduce the fever artificially, depriving the body, as the nabJropaths would say. ofthe opportunity to expel a proportion of the stored toxins. AIlemative Medicine therefore has CD be against the use of surJ1 medicines that foil tlte body's efimination attempts and compel it to retam \"PAGE\". OlW FOlDER ONE SECl10N B 3.3.3 Crises \\/\\/here the surge in tissue activity reaches a crescendo and the activily level is overwhelming, the condition is refen'ed to as a 'crisis', or a 'healing crisis'. There is no absolute definition of such a aisis except that it tends towards the upper rmits of the acute state, to seriously lnaJrnlenience and even temporarily incapacilal.e the patient and that it tends to be systemic, ie to involve the whole of the patienrs system. The classic example, that has been cited many lines, dates back to before the time when alternative medicine had become a recognisable entity. The doctors of the early 20'\" CenUy' had no sulphonamides or antibiotics and ineVIabIy resorted to the naturopathic management of patients. With only caring and pa!Iative nursing att8ntion available, such patiBnts wou!d largely be left to their own devices while in fever. Doctors would then observe that pneumonia patients, who always developed a fever, vrould develop a crisis in that fever at a particular point in the course of the illness. Some patients might not: survive that crisis if the infection was too much in the ascendancy, but in oIhers the aisis proved to be a turning point and they would be out of danger quire soon after 1he crisis itself passed. In a case like that, where life itself is threatened, there is nothing very beneficial, of course, about the infection having occurred. The infectious organism in such cases is itself quite a serious '1Dxin', in the broadest sense and, indeed, is a biological entity that manufaclures lOxins. Nonetheless. the naturopathic principle at work here is that, in response to a threat, the body galvanises its resources of resistance. including its detoxification abilities. These having been unleashed upon the infection, they will, in the course of dealing with the infection ilsel, be capable also of effecting the elimination of some of the body's other long-stored toxins, thereby reducing the body's overaU toxic burden. In the case of life-threatening pneumonia, as we said above, nothing has been gained, since the patient win afterwards be found to be much depleted of resources. However. that does not invalidate the principle that more mtnor infections can act as inducers of an eliminatory response in the body that ends up having a markedly beneficial overall effect Classical natumpaths and orthodox practitioners have developed vastly different views about infectic:Ins. The orthodox view is that tre infe(;tiQn is an entirely negative ~ ~~ of trouble within a human body that might have been doing very well before the infection arrived. This view makes the influence at the infection absolutely adverse, a concept that is employed to justify the or1hodox onslaught With antibiotics. 'nstead, the naturopathic practitioners of the past toc* the view that the human body that had reached a certa~ point of toxic accumulation wiIh~ woqld 'seize upon' the opportunity presented by the infectious organism to mount a major elimination. This would be based upon and fuelled by, the acute activity surge that I would accompany the attack upon the infection. Infections were, therefore, not seen as just 'opportune' but were seen as occurring at appropriate moments to 'fit in with' the naturopathic needs of the body. Since you can, of course, die from an infection. and since there are such things as infections 1hat are capable of afflicting a high percentage of a given population. their negative or destructive aspects often outweigh naturopathic benefits. Where then does that leave us today? Today, there is no doubt that we shoUld see virulent infedioIlS as a very toxic hazard. What for example, could be the possible advantages of PIQ to central America and dying of yellow fever? In fact. the very serious tropical diseases over which we have least control do help us to put the matter into perspective. Tt-Bf are 01W The EhIAlnce ofIhe Life Fon:e ....... RllDER ONE SECTION B dangerous. The fact that some infections are not onfy toxic at the time they are in progIess. but also leave behind damage, like measles or rubeDa, also helps to disperse the i:tea that they can ever be an overall benefit to human kind. On the other hand, in defence of the long existing naturopathic position that non-life\u00ad threatening infections can be a benefit, we can see no reason why it should not be true that they often succeed in setting up a useful surge of immune and detoxifying activity. Hence. the body may end up in a more toxin-free state than at the outset This seems to fit in with clinical observation, wherein some forms of infectious episode lead to an improved condition afterwards. In other cases. infections appear. to the eye of the naturopath, to be at least an attempt at e5mina5on, but it is root always effective if the surge of actiYity that can be raised is insufficiently powerful. Suffice it to say here, at this early stage, that healing crises comprise a part of the Imanifeslations that arise from naturopathic and nutritional trealment. They must be spoiled, monitored and prescriptions must be attered to take account of them. Patients with n0n\u00ad threatening troubles must be steered clear of them whenever possible. Patients with threatening conditions should actively seek and grasp at a healing crisis. regardless of temporary inconvenience. for the sake of the detoxification it will engender. ~~Ai..~..~I READING: Inflammation is a high activit.y stale in the tissues that is recognised in the paIhoIogy books as being a normal body reaction to trauma or loXic damage. As such, it is a process that facilitates the access of the i'nmune system to the site of damage to ward off infections.. but it also lays down the early foundations for healing to occur. InflanwnatiOn can be either acute or chronic. Chronic inflammation has special significance of its own. Here we address acuIIe inflammation such as that which accompanies a cut finger. The area is affected by pain, swelling, redness and heat -the classical signs -denoted often by their rhyming latin names, dolor, tumor, rubor and calor. The swelling, redness and heat in the area reflect a greatly increased blood supply that brings in nUbienls. oxygen and elements of the inmune system, al in increased amounts. There is a weeping of coagulable fluid into the area that wiI eventually form the ground substance for healing growth of new cells to occur. This local acute inflammation is a form of hyperactivity that prepares for fighting infection and for repair . and replacement of damaged parts. it is a little different from hyperactivity that may arise spontaneously, ie without traumatic injury, in the internal organs in response to treatment We now address that phenomenon. c ........- , \"....., .... ... ~.... READING: II 3.3.5 Hyperactivity I Fevers. as discussed above, are a form of high activity throughout the entire body, accompanied by a raised temperature. Hyperactivity may occur without the raising of temperature. usuaiiy in individuai organs and systems. it could be in the nervous system, it 11 i I MGEIUD O'NU FOLDER atE SECTION B could be in the bowel, or it coold be in individual small organs like, for example, the thyroid gland. This hyperactivity is chronic inflammation. It is in many respects like the hyperactivity of acute inflammation. in that the tissue activity level is raised, perhaps dramaticaHy and perhaps quite suddenly. The reason for this is usually because the organ or system concerned was toxic and perhaps damaged. At the very least. being toxic. it was chronic and suffering from low activity and under-functioning. The change from the chronic condition towards the acute can only come about through a change in circumstances with regard to the life Force. toxic inputs, or nutJitional balance. These events occasionally occur incidentaDy to fluctuations in life style. They are, of course, inherentty likeI'f to occur under treatment. So we hawe hype.-actMtj of indrYidual OfgallS artd systems as well as feverish whole body hyperactivity. These more local spates of hypelactivity can nonetheless exert quite an impact upon the patient. with actual soreness of the affected area, swelling ofthe organ ~ it is one that can be palpated (ie felt). or the effects of IempOrary over-function. AI of these hyperactive (acute) states are ones that potentially may be taken before the doctor\"s attention for the administration of suppressive medicines. In all cases. as seen by the naturopathic practitioner. this is a very retrograde step. preventing the body's normal seIf\u00ad preseMng processes d self-deansing and seIf-repair. 3.4 Smoother Eliminations The great advantage of smoother eliminations. if they can be produced, is that they cause no cflSWiilfurl, no marked hyperactivity and no risk of putting the patient into bed for a week of recuperation. The ability to achieve this or not is partly a matter of case-management It is a matter of matching the strength of treatment to the constitution of the patient, so as to give trealment, without excessive fast reaction. This is not always possible because patients with S8W!re conditions may need to detoxify urgently. Moreover. there are limits to the practitioner's abifity to judge the strength of treatment. Sometimes healing crises are produced when not really wanted on account of idiosyncrasies ofthe patienrs constitutional make-up. When smooth e\"'minations are achieved. the strength d treatment is just right to give rise to a shedding of toxins from the tissues at a rate that the excretory organs can handle without uncomb1able symploms developing. 3.5 The Law of Cure We have above depicted the move from relative health to chronic iHness as a downward path. Equally, the route back from the edge of the abyss of chronic illness is one of revitalisation and detoxificatiolli. The idea of the 'route back' was spotted years ago by the homoeopath, Constantine Hering, and has become known as 'Hering's Law of Cure'. A core idea that is embodied in his Law is that as you progress downward towards in health. you pass through dJJerent stages of disease characterised by different symptom paltems. Then, if you take up naturopathic (or homoeopathic or nutritional) treatment and begin 10 retrace your steps, these earier symptom patterns win recur. This, then, leads to the idea that there tends 10 be a recapitulation of former symptom patterns during recovery. OlW The EbuIience ofthe Life Force FOLDER ONESECTION B The Law further embodies the notion that toxins. and therefore symptoms. tend\u00b7 to move outward from within as recovery or deansing occurs. This is fully in accord with the classical naturopath's ideaS. Toxins close to the surface of the body are conceived to be most likely on lheir way out The skin is an eliminatory organ and toxins at or near the skin level are not so much of a threat to weD being. Naturally, the patient may well be honified at the disfiguring rash that may be seen by al. Nonelheless, the patient is seen to be far better off than when ii having these toxins deep within the body. held, perhaps within essential organs that are becoming progressively damaged. It also embodies the idea of the hierarchy of organs whereby, during cleansing, the most important organs are cleared first The full statement ofthe Law reads: MCure proceeds from above downward, film within outward, from the most impol't.1nt 01'1305 to ~ imporum: organs and in the rewrse order of ~ ofsymptomS. tr Some of us may not feel quite so sure as Hering that 'from the top downward' is necessarily always such an important parameter. However, clinical experience leaves little mom for doubt about the impor1ance Qf the other two components of this Ylw. These are much c;eIebIa(ed in alemative medicine circles for bringing understanding about the inter-relationship of symptoms and conditions. Vithoulkas (1986) adds to this a corollary: \"Cure proceeds by amelioration on internal planes coupled with die appearana! of a dkcharge or eruption of skin or mucous membranes.\u00b7 This does not add any different idea, but illustrates the type of change to be expected during the healing process. When we obsenIe. on the other hand, the progression d diseaSe from milder, more reactive conditions, towards more serious ones, the processes desaibed in Hering's Law all tend to go in reverse. The progression of disease is therefore best desaibed as Hering's law of Cure working in reverse. The writer has often been tempted to can it I Plasketrs Law. just because it seems never to have been stated clearty as such, and it goes as follows: \"The progression of chronic disease proceeds from the bottom upwMd, from without to within, from the I~ important organs to the most important organs and in a pattern of increasing severity of the symptoms or labelled conditions leac:lng onward towards more under-function, loss of function and death.\u00b7 The naturopath sees a complete inevitabiity about this process whereby the only answer to Slopping this onward deterioration is to reverse the process and detoxify. Since the toxins, and the accompanying low life Force and nutritional stress or imbalance, are the actual and real cause ofthecondition ofthepatient, nothing useful wi. be likely to happen unless they are addressed. If paHiation should be achieved by toxic means then, of course. the overall mndilion can only worsen. This is the usual experience with chronic illness treated wiIh drugs. ME8.22 OlW FOLDER ONE SECTION B 3.6 Suppression Naturopathic Law states that there is an especiaUy high price to be paid for suppressing, ie stopping an acute elimination. For example, simply stopping the rhinitis and discharge associated with a cold prevents the toxins from being elininated by these routes. That much has been coveted. Simiariy, cutting out the gaiibiadder because it contains galistDnes and has become inflamed and painful, is perhaps a solution of a sort. but the reasons for the gallstones forming in the first place have not been addressed. The fact that the cause has to do with the incorrect function of the liver has not been realised and nothing has been done to remedy 1hat underlying problem. The likelihood is that. even though gallstones cannot recur. The EbuIiencetbere wil be other distinctty adverse effecIs from the wrong fundion of the Irver. These have ofb! ure Force almost certainly not been taken into account Hence, the disease is still present and nothing has been done towards eradicating it. Boils use 10 &well up into a red sore and then burst Y\u00aby bad ones, or carbuncles, might be lanced 10 cause the pus (morbid matter) to run out These days, boils and carbuncles tend 10 occur much less than formerly, presumably because of the lower life Force of the population and the generaly suppressive medical culture. The chances are that they get treated with an antibiotic long before they get a chance to come to a head and burst Such treatment is suppressive. in the sIrictIy naturopathic sense of the word. The same is absolutely bue with regard 10 bringing down artificially the temperature during a fever, whereas 'sweating it out' is the natural thing 10 do. , II It is the 'offence' or 'insult' that is being committed against the Life Force that is the subject d ! sharp focus by naturopaths in having to deal with these situations. They reckon to be able to I oIJserw in their patients that the body (or rather the bod(s Life Force) prepales iIseIt for some I\" time before it launches an energetic assault upon its toxic burden. There is considered to be a stDrirlg up d subtle energy that, through its close relationship with the biochemical energy of 1 the body, will eventually translate into a major immune system response and a celular : deloxD:ation response. When this bUilding up of energy has oa:urred it is considered to be a! vefY adverse step to stop it and thwart it by artificial means. The penalty to be paid is that the Life Force is considered to suffer a really serious set back to a point lower than it was before the build up started. It is also considered that the task of eliciting elimination in the future, either by a smoother process. or by a second healing crisis, is rendered far more difficult. We suggest that anything that offends and depletes the Ute Force can be regarded as suppressive and that this extends beyond physical realms and includes emotional. mental and even spiritual fadprs. Today we have an OI1hodox medical culture that is dominated by the 'pin to solve this and pin to solve that' kind of philoSOphy and it has led to a position in which suppression with drugs is rife. Infections, in particular, occur, are attacked with antibiotics, only to recur and to be atIaCked with antlJiotics again. In the course of this, any naturopath would say, the body's immune defences are being both hampered and inhibited, the life Foree set upon a path towards giving up, and the detoxifying mechamm is being over-blded and inhibited by the I unquestionably toxic drugs that are being used. The first key point of alternative medical I philosophy here is the role of the acute incident as an important detoxifying phase. The . second is 1he particularfy damaging effeet from stopping such incidents by artificial means. If I II OMJ FOLDER ONE SECTION B chronic diseaSe. Often, however, the position is finely balanced so that only a slight move towards a lowe.-Ioxie intake or a better micronutrient intake can make the difference between slow deterioration and slow recovery. Alternatively, only a slight knock to the life Force might make the difference between slow recovery and the start 01 a slow deteriolation. From the practitioner's standpoint this explains quite well how some patients respond at once to minor measlR\"eS taken for the good of their health, while others need really major moves to have any discernible effect 3.9 The Concept ofthe Chronically Acute The EbI6lnce The vision we have of the acute detoxifying reaction is simple enough. We picture. to use ofIhe Life Fon:e graphic terms. an army of leukocytes (white blood cells) launching an attack upon an infection by micro-organisms. coupled with a rapid production of detoxifying enzymes, with heightened tissue activity and oxygen consumption: However. we now consider what happens when the acute reaction cannot be overwhelmingly successful. Perhaps the acute reaction is mounted and gets under waty, but the toxic burden and the underlying under-function of the tissue, limit the strength ofthe mmune and enzymic onslaught Hence. the acute incident can only be half-hearted. It may fade away, due to lack of impetus. Or. aIIemativeIy, it may grind on wilhout noIabIe progress. The result of that is an on-going a!!empt in the tissues at an acute reaction, but it neither succeeds in getting off the ground nor does it fade away altogether. It is not clear that this slale has ever been fully recognised within the annals of naturopalhy. but this author has coined the tenn \u00b7chronically acute\u00b7 to descri>e it in naturopaahic terms. It has a definite equivalent in or1hodox pathology and 1bat is simply \u00b7chronic inftanwnalion\u00b7. Itcan be conceptualised as a \u00b7battIe\" between the forces of cleansing and the forces of toxicity that cannot be resolved. It becomes a \"war of attrition\u00b7. Neither side can win and, of course. the life Force is sapped away in the process. The inflammation that forms in arthritic joints is chronic inflammation. Note that the usual orthodox remedies are drugs to inhibit the inftammatory part. ofthe problem but they do nothing whatever to solve the initial reason for the inflammatiOn. ObvioUsly the inflammation itself is due to damage occurring in the joints. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are most commonly used for arthritis are aetuaDy known to increase joint damage -reference. Vidal y Pharmacal Res Commun 10 (6), 551-69 (1918). : They do this by inhibiting the repair of the joint substanCe as it wears. That alters the balance betWeen the breakdown of the joint substance and i1s replacement. in a wholly unfavourable direction. Hence, as is so often the case with orthodox drug treatment,. some relief from sympmms is gaMed in the short term but at the cost of long te..rm worsenil1g of the undeJ1ying condition. OlW MGE8.25 FOLDER ONE SECTION B 3.10 Summarising those Actions and Conditions that Encourage Toxic Elimination From an the foregoing it follows that elimination of toxins and. therefore. the patienfs recovery are fawured by: A light diet that is adequate but not excessive in bulk nutrients.

FME8.2I OlW 4 FOLDER OE SECTION 8 MOVEMENTS OF TOXINS WITHIN AND AROUND THE BODY 4\"1 The Concept of Toxic Deposits The purpose of this section is to focus more specifically upon the toxins themselves and their role in disease. We also wish to show something of the behaviour of toxins in the body whenever they are-shifted from the location where they have been deposited. Practitioners need to beoome familiar with the signs of these different forms of behaviour by toxic deposits. From the clinical standpoint it is by no means time to Ieam this. Here you simply Ieam of what the behaviour consists. Toxins must locate themselves somewhere. Upon being absorbed from the gut (if that is their route of enby) they wiD generaly enter the hepatic portal vein and be carried to the liver. This is a major organ of delDxification and elimination, so the toxins may be trcIlsfonned or removed here. We have to assume that for one reason or another that fails to happen and the toxins are able to flow through the liver into the blood that suppfies the general circulation. The toxins then have access to the whole body, though they may yet have to run the gauntlet of the kidneys. Again, assuming they are not picked out of the cireuIation here, they may 'lodge' anywhere. Skeletal muscle is the biggest mass of tissue, but many fat-soluble toxins dissolve in the fat of the fat depots (fat storage tissues) of the body. However, other solid OrgCBlS, such as the spleen may well take up toxins, but the fact is that they can lodge anywhere, according to mariathat are to be described below. Having been drawn preferentially to a specific tissue or tissues, the toxinS first reside there JemporariIy. We may then see what happens next through the eyes of Hans Heinrich Reckeweg. His six stages of toxifieation have been described eartier as a deepening interrelationship between the toxin and the tissue. The connection is seen as loose at first and the toxin is most easily dischargeable at the start It is susceptible to being erminated by even quite slight acute reactions that do not cause much symplDm trouble. The progression from this state to a tight bond with the tissue depends upon both time and toxic cOllceilbation. In the next stages (or phases, as Reckeweg calls them), the toxin is still reasonably readily dischargeable, though with a higher price to pay in respect of symptoms experienced. Thereafter a process develops that Reckeweg refers to as -impregnation-. This implies a ~ing to 1he tissue substance. In the terms that this writer uses, 1his aso implies . that tissue damage is being inflicted, because, as the toxin readS with the tissue, it is almost r certainly undergoing some chemical change too. The distinction that Reckeweg offers us, between the \"reaction phases-and the \"impregnation phases\", implies a great deallhat has to do with the seriousness of the situation. Reckeweg's -impregnation- certainly implies that the toxin is now very hard to remove, being combined with tissue substance. However, he recognises three stages of \"impregnation-, representing different degrees of chemical binding to tissue and hence different degrees of reversibility, though reversal is always said to be difficult. MovemenIs of Toxins within and around the Body OlW FOUlER ONE SECTION III 4.2 How lridology Helps us to See Toxic Foci As mentioned above, toxic foci (deposits) in the body show up in the iris of the eye. The iris is arranged so as to encompass a complete 'map' of the body. with an the organs and systems laid out upon it. Hence the location of a toxic deposit in the iris shows the iridologist its position within the body. The toJcins may appear as colours, spots. blobs and smears in particular places in the iris, or as darkened areas. Toxic deposits on the iris Reproduced w;th pennission hom Fenda ShafBIJ, School of f'JallJlal Medicine, www.prneheallh.com Where the Toxins Go -Weak Organs and Systems VVhilst is win not be obvious at first why toxins locale themselves in particular pa1s ofthe body, we have nonetheless provided a basic explanation. Since the opposition between toxIIs on the one hand and the life Force and the nutrients on the other exists. it follows that the balance between these factors may be different in different organs and systems. The iris again furnIShes us with information about how the person's constitutional strength varieS from II one part to another. It is, perhaps, falr1y obvious that regardless of whether a constiIution is strong or weak, the strengths and weakness vary from part to part:. If discomfort and misfunction, when they occur, most often occur in our kidneys, then it seems likely that the kidneys are the weakest organ. In fact organs tend to vary from very strong to quite weak and the pattern shows a marked genetic inheritance. We do not always need iridoIogy to show this. We have vert adequate diagnostie procedures in Nutritional Medicine apart from using the iris. However, when distinguishing between the conditions of different organs it is useful to mention the evidence that comes from iridology. Some forms of toxin have an affinily for cer1ain organs or systems of the body and so wil tend to locate there anyway. Hence, it seems that organophosphorus pesticides have a strong 1endency to locate in the neIVOUS system, including the brain. Apart from that kind of phenomenon, the tendency is for toxins to locate most heavily in the organs and systems that are constitutionally weaker than others are. Hence we find that a person's toxin burden is usually distributed according to a characteristic and unique personal signature. Another factor that can strongly influence their distribution (1hough this is also a part of that personal signature) is inheritance. because components of the toxic burden can be inherited diredly from parents, along with toxic location. FOLDER atE SEC110N B 4.4 What Detennines which Diseases we Get? Orthodox Medicine really has very little forecasting ability to determine which disease or diseases a person is likely to develop. One that it has recently acquired is genetic _lysis. though it is not yet much in use. It is, however. rather a blunt instrument in most cases. Although genetically determined illnesses may be uncovered. of course, these usually exist already and we are not talking about a forecast at an. For the major and common diseases all that genetics can normally provide is information about a tendency or an increased risk of a named concfltion. Orthodox medicine is also a source of potential infonnation about environmental effects. Ifyou are a smoker or a drinker. then it wiH influence your ilness risk in defined ways. but again you are only speaking of altered,. Of course. if your have had exposure to a carcinogen above certain levels. then you will be at increased risk. perhaps much increased risk of cancer, but almost no cancer is actually detected as a result of such information. Of course. naturopathic information about the weakness of particular organs, since these organs are the ones liable to suffer tom acctmulation and therefore tissue damage, gives us a clear pointer to the likely future sites of trouble. We can see that an individuafs pattern of illness will be determined in part by their vitality. nutrition, inheritance and toxic exposure. However. the individual pattern of strong and weak organs (which is a part of inheritance) is most likely to prove determinative of the location and nature of chronic complaints. All the time. dt.D1g a person's life, these various factors are interacting in a dynamiC way, producing diIferent patterns. It seems that only aItemative medicine has any real hope of seeing those patterns. Within the Orthodox field, genetic analysis is promising, if expensive. but we are only just starting to leam what to look fur. It may be a long time before this approach even begins to be as useful as the \"weak and strong organ\" diagnosis. 4.5 First Movement of Toxins: Elimination from Tissue Level When the toxins lie in the tissues. be it in a \"reactive\" state or an impregnated state. nothing dynamic is happening to the person except that in time, if the toxic condition is bad enough, 1here wi! eventually be some disease consequences probably slow in onset Rapid and more dynamic things tend to happen if these toxins are disturbed. Tc\u00bblins that have been Iocaled in weak organs C31 be regarded as having been '\"tucked away\" fur the timebeing. However. When they come out of the tissue in which they have lodged, they are reactive and symptDm-causing. Now ftowing freely in the blood plasma, in the intercellular ..lid and free to reach sensitive tissues anywhere in the body, they may well give rise to a -poison reaction-. as you might get if you took something pungent and destructive. It wiH be an appropriately robust tissue reaction unless the Life Force is very loW. 'MIen a person has toxins in the organs. they will find it most comtor1abIe to \"let sleeping dogs Iie-. As soon as something is done to disturb them, the sleeping dogs are no longer sleeping. To achieve a disturbance of the toxins you must usually apply naturopathic I nutritional treatment In doing so, we speak of applying an keliminatory pressure\". In each case the amount of such pressure required to generate significant reEase of toxins from the tissues is not exactiy known, though clues arising from our thorough diagnosis should be infolmative. OlW MavemenIs of TOlIins wiIhin and .-ound the Body PME&2I FOLDER ONE SECTION 8 Suffice to say here that each individual is going to take different degrees of SUCh pressure to instigate elimination from the tissue deposits. This is termed \"tissue level eliminatiOn\" and it is obviously the first necessary step towards getting rid of the toxins. Hence. there is no elimination totaUy free from the risk of \"poison reactions\". though at best they may be very short-lived or may be avoided altogether by correct management. Tissue level elimination anounts. therefore. to an expulsion of toxins from the tissues that are holding them. though. with some tissues, a certain level of biochemical transformation of the toxins may also occur at this stage. Obviously. the treatment applied to produce this eliminatory pressure will be a precisely defined combination ofthe various measures given above to encourage detoxification. 4.6 Relation to the Lymphatics The next stage in the overall process of efnnination is transportation from the tissues. a PlDCe$S that initially relies upon the lymphatic circulation. The tissues themselves are bathed in a filtrate of the blood called the intercellular fluid (or. alternatively. extracellular fIuid). TISSue level elimination implies expufsion from the tissues. The only way toxins can get out of the cells is via the intercellular fluid, which drains into the Iymphalic vessels. These vessels then drain to a number of lymph glands (which lymph glands will depend upon the aiall:lltlY of Ihe local lymphatic drainage). The really early \"poison reactions- may. therefore. occur in Ihe tissue from which the toxins are draining or else from the lymph glands or lymph vessels leading away from the site. They are most likely 10 consist of swelling. pain, inflammation and maybe infection. The point needs to be made that nothing is more vital at this stage than that the lymphatic vessels should be clear of obstruction and that a reasonable flow of lymph should be attained. lymph vessels do become clogged with mucus and certain sources blame the plasticizers from today's plastic utensils as another cause of such blockage. Treatment exists to help to clear blocked lymphatics. Nutritional. herbal and massage methods can all be brought to bear if needed to clear the way for proper tissue level elimination to take place unimpeded. 4.7 Movement of Toxins: Systemic Effects The lymphatic vessels link up into larger ones and eventually drain into the blood cin::uIaIion by . enlering the subdavian vein (in the shoulder area) via the thoracic duet. After that point the toxins that have come from the tissues are freely circulating and can reach any site in the body. From this point on the -poison reactions\" may occur anywhere. Obviously. this will tend to be in the most sensitive and reactive organs. those most easily \"triggered\" into this kind of activity. Therefore, the nature of any reaction that occurs can be quite varied. The brain and nervous system is often in the front line and the results may be headache. migraine. agilation, confusion or insomnia. to mention only a few. General muscle aches and pains. or pains in the joints. are also common. especiaDy if these body parts are in a vulnerable condition. Any body part or organ. particularty if already in an irritated state, through inflanunalion. is likely to respond at this point with increased reactivity. pain and other symptoms, as it becomes subject to Ihe effects of the circulating toxicity. 'PMiEUO 01W FOLDER OlE SECTION B Obviously, the practitioner who is monitoring the patient will identify the arousal of such systemic effects. The positive aspect of this type of event is that it confirms that tissue level elimination has occurred. The question that now arises is just how effective can be the elimination of the disturbed toxins. Fruit fasts, especially so-called \"grapefruit fasts-are, depending upon the way you look upon them, either famous or notorious naturopathic means of elimination. They are famous on account of rather wide use. They are notorious because ofthe .poisOn reaction- effects that they produce. In the long run there is little point in arousing tissue level etiminations unless they can be matched with effective work by the e1iminatory organs. This wortt is either to transform the IDxins to non-toxic, or onty slightly toxic products {called by Reckeweg '\"homotoxones-), or to pass them right out ofUle body in excretions, or preferably both. Too many patients treated by practitioners of nutritional medicine succeed with tissue level elimination (sometimes called Level 1 efimination), only to fail at the level of the elimir.atDr; organs (level 2). The results are as described below. 4.8 Frustrated Attempts to get Outside: Aggravations A few oomments on terms would be helpful at this stage. An \"'elimination\" is a very general term, because it can be applied to any successful or partialy successful voiding of toxins from the body. This is so whether the eliminatiOn is gradual or precipitate, comfortable or distressing. The term \"tissue level elimination- only refers to eliminations from the individual tissues, not from the body. Because so many patients, as just stated, respond to treatment by eliciting Level 1 elimination but fail aI Level 2, we are often faced with the consequences of \u00b7circulating toxicity\". This is a -stand-ofI'\" siluation between the toxins and the body forces seeking to eliminate them. But it does not amount to a \u00b7chronic inflammation\u00b7 situation, ie the \u00b7chronically acute-. as set out above, because those situations are long term, on-going wars of attrition and represent the basic reason for the prime symptoms of many chronic ilnesses. By contrast. the .sIand-off' that we now seek to recognise is short term and acute. It is the equivalent of a healing crisis that does not come off. nus means that the tissue level elimination is intense and -poison reactions- ocwr around the body. They occur intensely and often distressingly because, with the failure of level 2 elimination, there is no Iet-up from, nor amefioration of, the toxic symptoms. At the height ofthe problem, of course, the forces that set in motion the efmination from tissue level, go on working, intensifying the '\"poison reactions-. Since there is failure to remove theSe ciraJlating poisons from the blood, the adverse reactions go on until eventuaRy the tiSsue level elimination subsides and the toxins can be taken up again by tissues. either the tissues from whence they came, or by other tissues. In either event, the whole exercise has been pointless. This poindess -arousal\u00b7 of the body's toxin stores is referred to as an -aggravation-, Please note how distinct it is from a healing crisis or from a smooth elimination. It is specificaly the result of blockage at Level 2 accompanied by rather intense activity at level 1. It is likely to be of relativety short tem1, like a healing crisis, often just days, at the most a few weeks. That IalIer point about timing cIear1y demarcates it from chronic inflammation. which is usually at a IolIIler intensity and really long term. Movements of ToJlins wiIhin and aroood the Body FOLDER OlE SECTION B Hence, aggravations comprise a common problem to practitioners in the management of their cases. They have to calm down tissue Ievet elimination, while seeking, through longer run measures. to open up the channels to the outside. The intention is that, as treatment develops. a similar amount of etiminatory pressure may be applied to the patient. and that it will then prove effective. Obviously, aggravations may occur at all sorts of differing degrees of severity. Sometimes lesser aggravations may be experienced when the tissue level eliminatory pressure is slight, or when the blockage at level 2 is only a partial one. lIME... OlW Fa.DER ONE SECTION B Suffice to say here that each individual is going to take different degrees of such pressure to instigate elimination from the tissue deposits. This is termed utissue level elimination\u00b7 and it is obviously the first necessary step towards getting rid of the toxins. Hence. there is no elimination totally free from the risk of \u00b7poison reactions\u00b7, though at best they may be very short-lived or may be avoided altogether by correct management Tissue level elimination amounts, therefore. to an expulsion of toxins from the tissues that are holding them, thoUgh, with some tissues, a certain level of biochemical transformation of the toxins may also occur at this stage.

The tissues themseIYes are bathed in a filtrate of the blood called the intercellular fluid (or. alternatively, extracellular fluid). TISSue level elimination implies expulsion from the tissues.

FOLDER. ONE SECTION B weaned progressively off the antibiotics. The antibiotics had become a part of his disease. It will be no surprise that the doctofs open-mindedness did not extend that far. Attempts to work with orthodox practice will aJways hit that type of problem very early unless there is a real understanding about it on both sides. It also calls for the medical people involved to drop any false sense of superiority over the other. A doctor can refer the patient. but such a patient needs to be allowed to place faith in the alternative practitioner's methodS. The patient in the above example was actually beyond the help of the doctor, but having to consent to the cautious removal of antibiotics from the treatment proved to be a step 100 far. 5.3 Do Drugs have a Place? Yes they do. People are surprised sometimes to hear us say so. Any symptoms that are genuinely of a potentiaDy life-threatening nature, or which are so severe that you cannot ask the patient to bear them. should be remedied by orthodox means. if altemative treatment is lD1availabie or would take 100 long to take errect. However, if this situation occurs. then we have to recognise that opportunities to act earlier with ahemative solutions have most probably been missed. Alternative therapy is ideally suited to the prevention of illness or CD the ireaiment of chronic illness that is in eariy stages or in rnickourse. Advanced chronic illness may be IJealabte too. but will require a great deal of time and attention. Hence, intense pain of sudden onset may demand drugs. Very serious asthma cases may need steroids. but only because no one attended to their needs soon enough and an emergency developed. In the absence of universal availability and, indeed, universal application, of aIIemative preventative measures on the Health service and similar availability of alternative bealment for ailments in their early stages, drugs wi. have to be used. Since the continued use of drugs in a serioUs chronic illness is likely to hefald a further downward spiral into even more serious conditions, due to toxicity. we need flexibility lIbout what happens next Since to treat wiIh toxic chemical drugs is an anathema to the principles of wholistic medicine, any attempt at alternative treatment at this point will necessitate a commitment to a cautious and well\u00ad supported withdrawal ofthe drug in the future. Those who commit themselves to follow alternative medicine treatment for all their minor ailments are relatively unlikely to ever reach an emergency that positively demands the use of drugs. All the foregoing appfles to -acquired metabolic disease- and does not apply, of course, to simpie injury or to the results of past operations that may leave the palienls minus cer\\ain organs. or with organ transplants. 5.4 What Place for Surgery in Acquired Disease? The position of sul1JE!fY in relation to aItemative medicine is rather like the position mdrugs. butwithout the toxicity elemenls, excepting in respect ofthe necessary anaesthetics. Hence. it may become, of course, quite dramatically pressing to have the appendix out. By the time that FOLDER atE SECTION B happens there is an emergency. Whatever else. you must hand to surgeons an unlimited accolade in respect of their skills in dealing with these situations. as also in dealing with an fonns of physical injury. These people are great masters of sewing up the physical body when it has been tom apart But we would far rather save the patienfs appendix. tonsils, or gallbladder ifat all possible. Removal is only really necessary if the situation has already been atrowed to become dangerous. Otherwise. alternatNe medicine. especially nubitional medicine, has a good record of helpfng to save these body parts. From time to time cancer patients seek our advice. We oniy assist such patients when they have decided for themseIYes to adopt a nutritional approach. Sometimes they have decided to reject at or1hodox forms of treatment, though that is not necessarily recommendable. It can often help for them 10 have the primary tumour removed and then apply nutritional treatment to combat any cancerous residue or simply to inhibit recurrence. In that sense surgery and alternative treatments can be co-operative. However. untif orthodox practitioners recognise and value what aIIernative therapists can achieve. tbeIe can be no real co-operatiorl For tbe patient simply 10 decide to undergo the two forms of treatment in sequence does not imply c0\u00ad operation. 5.5 What Place for Immunisations? Here we shalf restrict ourselves to saying as little as POSSible. We shall. indeed. make no recommendations. However. the classical naturopaths and homoeopaths have aU been of one voice in condemning the use of morbid diseased matter for injection into the human body to prevent disease. It was not, they said, a proper procedure. There has also been much disagreement about how effectNe such measures are. Of course. whenever there is danger of infection. it is wrong to do nothing. At least you stIoufd use the homoeopathic equivalent Ireatmenl As to 1he effectiveness ofthose methods, that is beyond the scope ofthiS course. As to the pet'SOI1al 'liew of the writer. it is that the natural therapists who tlaVe declared 1hernseUes on this topic in the past are probably right They have mainlained that inmLmisalion is just another form of toxin and an especially potent one capable. on its own. of sparking a downward spiral into ill health in susceptible people. As to what extent that effect might be balanced by benefit. that is an Lmresolved argument The writer does not use immunisations to IheMedicaI 0rIh0daxy I I I II II I ~ I 1$ I i~ elW ,I ~ l\u00bb THIS IS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NUTRIENTS, TOXINS AND THE LIFE FORCE.

What significant difference Is there between the terms -alternative medicine- and -complementary medicine-; what are the objections to the latter? b. When might you accept the use of drugs? c. What is the difference in principle between orthodox and altemative treatment? ~ ~ . . 7 ANSWERS TO CHECKPOINTS Due to the diVeI'sily ofthe checkpoint questions some ofthe answetS below ate prrMded only as a guideline for students to aid with comprehension and revision. Some questions ate open to a degree ofirJtefpretation and students are enoouragecl to include their own opinions wheI'e appropriate. 7.1 Checkpoint One a. Naturopathy is based on the philosophy that the body is inherently seI-healing and the practitioner is there to stimulate and support this process. Naturopaths view al diseases as one and as the body's attempts to rid itself of toxins. The patient is perceived as an individual with hislher own genetic inheritance, constitution and lire expeliellces. NabJro.. palhic treabnent is primarily focused on causes not symptoms and addresses the whole person not simpfy the diseased organ or system. b. Palliative care addresses the symptoms and manifestation of a disease without expb'\u00ad ing and treating the cause. Treatments are designed to contain and suppress jllness l symptoms and make the ecndition easier for the patient to bear. They do nothing to re\u00ad move or correct the causes ofthe discomfort and in some cases are known to exacer\u00ad bate the undertying problem An horlStic treatment approach ~ seeks the undertying causes of disease S)iiiptomS and emphasis is placed on er.couraging the body to rectify the fundamental cause ofthe problem. In holistic treatment consideration is given not just to the affected organ or system but also to the whole person including physical body, emotional state and the life force. c. MaIy orthodox practitioners do not accept the link between nutrition and heaIIh and are usually sceptical and damning about the application of nutritional treatment Where a medical practitioner does adopt the use of nutrients in practice. it is often done for rea\u00ad sons of pallation and with extreme selectivity. Single supplements such as calcium or iron are often prescribed, with the exdusion ofmany very important nutrients such as magnesium. zinc and manganese. Prescription drugs are given regularly for the paU. tion of symptoms no matter how minor. Many are inhibitory in nature and are detrimental to the life force. The toxicity ofthe drugs and the effect of these toxins on the body\"s systems must be considered. Although this varies widely from drug to drug in general, FOlDER OlE SECl10N B the more effective the drug the more toxic they are. The lie force is left more inhlJited after every treatment and this is reputed to drive the disease deeper, which may lead to more frequent severe disease manifestations. 7.2 Checkpoint Two a. As the toxic load increases so does the tissue damage. The first effects comprise an impairment of biochemical function, including the ability to produce cell energy. This cansisIs of a slowing down of the most key processes of metabolism. After that the ceO membranes and key structures become progressively damaged. The aceumuiation at toxins leads to a loss of the ability to repair and replace faulty components. Eventually this process leads to necrosis, or cell death and tisSue activity has then to be perfonned by the remaining cells. which may also be biochemically impaired. b. Fevers; crises; inflarnmation; hyperactivity. An acute reaction is an important eliminatory mechanism bywhich the body attempts to rid itself oftoxic waste products. It is charac\u00ad terised by stimulation of tissue activity resulting from hyperactivity and increased bi0\u00ad chemical function. This results in a major increase in the tiSsue resources of energy and a greater ability to synthesise necessary substances. A chronic reaction can be de\u00ad scribed as an unsuccessful acute reactiOn that is unable to fade away. White blood cells and detoxifying enzymes are mobilised at the point of damage or infection but are un\u00ad able to launch an adequate immune response. This may be due to toxic burden or cern\u00ad promised tissue function but wi!1 continue indefinitely causing inftammation, tissue dam\u00ad age and necrosis. c. The law of cure was developed by the homeopath Constantine Hering. He beieved that as you progress downwards fO'Nard ill health you pass through different stages of dis\u00ad ease characIerised by different symptom patterns. If one begins 10 work towards better health these former symptom patterns will be revisited during recovery. The law also siaies that symptoms move outward from within as recovery occurs and from abOVe downwards. Hering believed in a hierarchy of organs with elimination ofsymptoms DC\u00ad CUfTing in most important organs first to the least important last d. Suppression is the stopping of an acute eimination withoot addressing the cause of the disease sIaIe. Suppression within orthodox medicine can consist ofblocldng or inhiHting eIminatory pathways or, more aggressively. surgical removal of eliminatory products or organs. The effects ofsuch suppression usually resultS in recunence of the same pr0b\u00ad lem at a later date or, if this is not possible due to the removal of tissue. then other ad\u00ad verse effects will manifest at another site. later symptoms may be more severe as the toxins accumulated from administered drugs add to the toxic burden ofthe body and push it further along the path towards disease. Suppression advefseJy affects the life force as it is thought that it prepares iIseIf for some tme before it launches an assauft uponits toxic burden. When this accumulation of energy is suppressed it is thought to give adverse consequences. The life force is thought to suffer a serious set back to a point lower than it was before and future eliminations become more difficult. e. The siZe of the toxic burden, the strength of the life force and micro nutrient status strongly influence a person's response to treatment. Therefore a person '4Irith a low loxie burden, high micro nutrient status and strong life force should respond well to very litUe treaIment. These factors are all interrelated and mllectiveiy enabie a person to success\u00ad fufty detoxify as and when it is necessary. OlW fWE... .rotDER ONE SECTION B 7.3 Checkpoint Three a. Toxins absorbed from the gut will generaly enter the hepatic por1al vein and be carried to the liver, here they should be transformed or removect However ifthis process faIs U1e toxins are able to flow through the liver into the blood that supplies general circu1a\u00ad tion. If they are not picked out ofthe circulation by the kidneys they can lodge anywhere. Many fat soluble toxins dissolve in the fatty storage tissue ofthe body but other solid organs such as the spleen take up toxins. b. The impregnation phase when a toxin has lodged in a tissue for some tine and begins to chemicaDy bond to the host tissue. This implies damage occurring to the tissue as it is said to incur chemical changes. The toxin is then thought to be very hard to remove as it is now combined with the tissue substance. co Some loons of toxins have an affinity to certain organs or systems of the body and will tend to locate there. However, the tendency is for toxins to locale most heavily in the organs and systems that are constitutionally weaker than others. Inheritance can also influence toxic load because components ofthe toxic burden can be inherited direcUy from parents, along with toxic location. d. TISSue level elimination is the process oftoxins leaving their host tissue and entering the blood plasma in the intercellular fluid. This is usually achieved by naturopalhiclnutritional treatment and is a necessary first step in the process ofdetoxification. e. An aggravation reaction occurs when the intense tissue level elimination has occurred but the body is unable to fflroove d1e circulating toxins from the body. It is a short term acute reaction as once tissue level elimination ceases the toxins will be taken up .... by the tissues. Toxins resting in the tissues generally cause few dynamic reactions. However, once out ofthe tissues they may well give rise to a poison reaction, similar to ifyou took something pungent and destructive. This win continue to worsen until tissue IewI elimination ceases as plasma toxin levels increase. f. Healing aises and aggravations are both acute, systemic reactions to elimination. H0w\u00ad ever, an aggravation is the pointless arousal of the body's toxin stores wneh in no way leads to detoxification ofthe body whereas a healing crisis is a response to neePStay and successful detoxification. The crisis occurs where a surge in tissue activity, as a fflsporlse to disease. reaches a aescendo and causes intense efimination oftoxins. Unlike aggravations, successful phaSe II elimination rids the body of these toxins. 8 EXAMPLE ANSWERS FOR POINTS TO PONDER There are no right or wrong BnswefS to the questions given belaw. They are simplyincluded 10 encourage students to explore their beliefs. Sample answetS are merely given as a guideline. 8.1 Relating to section B. subsections 1 and 2 a It is the notion, not as yet scientifically proven. that the life in any living organism, inc1ud\u00ad ing the human body. is sustained by a vital principle that cannot be explained in tenns of physics and chemistry. It is believed to be a subtle non-material, organising energy force quite distinct from the physical body that determines whether life can exist, the physical form an organism takes and the vigour and vitality it displays. It is thought to be a auciaI facIDr in determining patterns of health and disease as it de1ennines our ability to ~ coYer from stress and trauma. PME8AO OlVU --- FCI..DER OlE SECTION B b. The life force inhabits a potentially perfect physical body. The main threat to the integ\u00ad rity ofthat body is from hannful toxins acquired from environmental sources and the bodies own metabolic waste. These cause biochemical imbalances and abnonnalities of physiological function, which in tum inhibit and dampen the life force by acaKnUIa\u00ad tion of pollution in its physical home. The life force is then seen to struggle to oppose these adverse events and recreate a perfect environment This task expends much energy and can manifest in lowered vitality if persistently required. The macronubients are our source of biochemical energy. Some energy is expended on digestion and as\u00ad similation ofthese nutrients. Ifexcess amounts are consumed, particularly of protein. excess energy is utilised for breakdown and disposal ofwaste products. cells do not function optimally if loaded with surplus nutrients and waste and therefore the life force rnis affected. Chemical modification of bulk nutrients during processing can produce tox\u00ad..ins and aller their structure malUng them difficul to break down. This again requires the body to employ excess energy, which couJd be used for other activities inclUding detoxffication. The micronuments perform a number ofroles in the body ensuring the functioning of biochemical pathways and reactions will flow better ifthey are present in the correct balance. WJthout the micronutrients the life force is seen to shive for high activity in the body whilst being blocked by biochemical imbalances. With adequate micronutrients intake the life forQe is released from inhibition and tissue activity in\u00ad creases. c. I believe that Kirlian photOgraphy is Ihe most convincing evidenoe for the existence of the life force because it is a phenomenon that has been observed by multiple scien\u00ad tists before drawing wider attention. The photographs produced are visual evidence and could be attributable to little else beside some kind ofenergy field. Perhaps 1he most compeling aspect of Ki1ian photography is the diminishing ofthe energy pat\u00ad 1ems seen around leaves once they are cut from the plant and the negligible energy field visible around processed foods. 8.2 Relating to section Bt subsection 5 a The Ierm -alternative medicine\u00b7 suggests a group of discipines that is autonomous from and a replacement for orthodox treatment The tenn -complementary medicine\u00ad suggests that it is a discipline that is used alongside orthodox medicine for the benefit of the patient It suggests that the two disciplines complement each other. Objections arise to the latter term as orthodox and alternative medicine practises are based on opposing philosophies that often work against what the other is trying to achieve. Fur\u00ad thermore many orthodox practitioners show littte respect or understanding for a1terna\u00ad tive treatment and are unwilling to work with afternative practitioners. b. The use of drugs may be accepted when symptoms are potentially life threatening or too severe to bear and altemative treatments are either unavailable or would take too long to take effect. Intense pain of sudden onset may demand drugs, as may very se:1\u00ad ous asthma cases where steroids need to be administered. Alternative theJapy is ide\u00ad ally suited to prevention of illness or to the treatment of chronic illness in itS early to middle stages. Advanced chronic illness may aiso be treatabie but it is likely to take a great deal of time and effort. If these situations occur then it is probable that ear1ier opportunities for intervention using al1emative therapy have probably been missed. making the use of drugs unavoidable. c. The basis of the lfdJerences between orthodox and alternative treatment rleS in their handling and interpretation of symptoms of disease. Orthodox medicine is predomj.. nanUy palliative in nature and seeks to suppress and reduce symptoms using any means necessary whether such treatments are toxic or not They seek to stop the body's response to a disorder without righting the disorder itself. AlternatiVe medicine regards symptoms as a necessary elimination progress undertaken by the body to re\u00ad move an underlying condition. It is concemed with actively encouraging that elimina\u00ad tion whilst seeking to address the fundamental cause ofthe problem using natural products designed "}
