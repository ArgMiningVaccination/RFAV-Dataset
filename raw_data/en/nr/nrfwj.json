Introduction Viral immune evasion Each viral pandemic reminds the biomedical community of the need for a deeper understanding of mechanisms used by viruses to evade the organism`s immune defense. Multiple strategies by which a pathogen evades the host, such as viral epitope escape mutations [1-3], latency, and reservoir formation [4-6]; but also induced immunomodulatory mechanisms, such as cellular apoptosis dysregulation [7-9], viral [12, 13], the macrophage blocking of viral antigens on major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules [13, 15], interference with the antibody and complement functions [16, 17] and inference with the glucose metabolism [18] and cytokines [19, 20] have been described. The number of mechanisms outlined here is not complete and stems from an inseparable virus-host co-evolution. Some of the co-evolved viruses employ multiple mechanisms of evasion and host immune subversion to establish chronicity. Months or years can pass before the host-destructive pathogenicity of a virus is revealed in the form [21]. How can viruses replicate, form reservoirs and establish persistence with very little recognition from the host immune system? How can the immune response be modulated toward an efficient viral clearance? Although our understanding of the viral immune evasion has improved over the years and has been extensively studied from the perspective of T cell-mediated immunity and MHC presentation, less is known about the mechanisms regulating B cell responses in chronic infections. B cell responses in chronic viral infection Acute viral infections, such as influenza in humans or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in mice, are transient and rapidly eliminated by the host immune systems. Chronic viral infections, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV), pose a protracted burden on the host immune system, and despite the extensive research in the respective fields, there is no cure for either HIV or HBV, or vaccination (HIV, HCV). As a model, the advantage of the LCM virus is its ability to establish either acute or chronic viral infection, depending on the strain [22]. Here we concentrate on the chronic, LCMV Clone 13 infection model, which is characterized by a protracted viremia and viral antigen persistence in the organs of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice for months [23, 24]. The T cell mediated immune response, in the form of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and CD4+ T helper cells is exhausted later in the infection course [25, 26], and viral clearance depends on the B cell response [27]. Both, early induced immunoglobulin M (IgM) [28, 29] and IgG can reduce the viral load and mediate clearance of the chronic infection [30], the latter being a characteristic isotype of antibodies identified and studied for their ability to prevent entry of the virus into the target cells or in other words to neutralize the virus [31, 32]. However, neutralizing antibodies (nAb) against chronic pathogens arise late, if at all [33-37]. To date, virus neutralization is a correlate of protection for most vaccines in clinical use ([38], WHO). It is dependent on the formation of long-lasting antibody secreting cells. In addition, as manifested by the HBV vaccination, immunological memory can be a prerequisite for protection, after the initial high antibody titer subsides [39]. The development of a successful vaccine against HIV and HCV still requires more mechanistic insights into the immunology of neutralizing antibody formation. Thus far, several reasons for the insufficiency in the B cell response have been postulated; they are directly linked to the recognition of the viral antigen by the B cell receptor (BCR). Viruses escape the neutralization by mutating their surface proteins [40, 41]. Immune evasion also results from conformational masking and glycosylation of the BCR-targeted viral epitopes [42-45]. B cell maturation towards neutralizing specificity is a continuous, multifaceted process throughout the course of a viral infection. Activation of a na\u00efve B cell by an antigen can happen in a T cell-independent or dependent fashion, in the antigen contact zones such as the peritoneum, marginal zone (MZ) or B cell follicles (FO), respectively. Na\u00efve circulating B cells are chemotactically attracted to the follicular zones in the lymph nodes and spleen. They interact with soluble antigens or antigens presented on macrophages and dendritic cells [46, 47]. The peptides, presented on the B cells` major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II), are recognized by CD4+ T cells, which increases the expression of CD40 ligand (CD40L) and IL-4, to further stimulate B cell proliferation [48-51]. The interaction between the B and T cells and the subsequent proliferation leads to a germinal center (GC) formation. Further B cell clones with the specificity for immunizing antigens can enter the GCs [52-55]. Thus, both starting affinity and frequency of na\u00efve specific precursors may be limiting factors for GC reactions [56], where the BCR is modified by class switch recombination and affinity maturation [55]. High BCR affinity is (Ig) genes [57, 58] and shapes the B cells` fate upon germinal center exit [59]. Random non-productive SHM can potentially lead to the formation of autoreactive B cell clones [60, 61]. Self-antigen binding within the GC activates tolerance mechanisms, which includes but is not limited to Fas-regulated clonal deletion [62-64]. B cell clones binding to self-antigen to the same or lower extent than foreign immunogens are transiently or terminally positively selected [65-68]. Moreover, autoreactivity is not an uncommon feature in the pool of antibody producing B cells that can neutralize a broad spectrum of viruses within the host [69-72]. How exactly these specificities are formed within the high GC clonal diversity remains an open question. In addition to the affinity, the BCR isotype may play a role in the B cell fate and non-IgM classes bias towards plasma cell differentiation [73-75]. Long-lived plasma cells (LLPC) are a later result of the GC reaction when compared to memory B cells [76]. Both LLPC, residing within the bone marrow, and memory B cells confer effective responses following repeated viral exposures [77-79]. Additionally, a GC-independent subset of IgM memory B-cells and IgM LLPC have been recognized [80] [81]. Both IgG and IgM memory B cells can re-enter the GCs upon secondary recall [82, 83] Most of the above-mentioned understanding of B cell responses is based on immunization studies, and we will discuss it further with our observations of B cell populations and antibody responses in the physiological infectious context. B cell repertoire diversity The na\u00efve B cell repertoire is the starting material for the generation of antibody responses in chronic viral infection. In LCMV, we do not know the number of antigen-specific, non-experienced B cells with a binding ability for neutralizing epitopes. It has been recognized that precursor frequencies of B cells, specific for some viral proteins, and particularly neutralizing epitopes, are low [84-86]. Studies of HIV and influenza patients show that B cells with a correct neutralizing epitope specificity may be rare or have a very low affinity and thus are outcompeted in GC reactions [87-90]. The pre-immune B cell repertoire is formed in the bone marrow and adjusted by tolerance mechanisms. BCR diversity generation starts with the recombination activating gene (RAG)- dependent functional rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. The diversity (DH) gene is first rearranged to the joining (JH) gene before joining to the (VH) region; this is followed by the immunoglobulin light chain rearrangement of VL and JL regions [91]. Combinatorial diversity of just functional rearrangement creates a repertoire capable of recognizing 5x1013 different antigens (for comparison, there are approximately 1014 cells in the human body, 1013 of those are human) [92]. BCR rearrangement depends on the formation of double-stranded breaks (DSB) and is guided by the recombinant signal sequences (RSS); conserved sequences with 12 and 23 base pair spacers, adjacent to the recombination site. Subsequent DNA repair via signal joint formation or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is imprecise, adding base pairs in the process and further contributing to the immunoglobulin variability through junctional diversity [93]. The antibody molecule interacts with an antigen at the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), while framework regions (FRs) are a structural component of the antigen-binding antibody fragment (Fab). There are three CDRs with unique VH/VL combinations, contributing to the antibody diversity. CDR3 is often longer and contains hydrophobic residues in the antibodies, which can neutralize persistent viruses [94, 95]. BCR diversity of the na\u00efve immunoglobulin molecules, therefore, comes from the number of V, D, J genes, combinatorial diversity of the V - (D)J joining of either the heavy or the light chain, junctional diversity of the recombination process, and further combinatorial diversity of the VH and VL pairing. The B cell reactivity to foreign pathogens has to be achieved without generating potentially harmful autoreactivities; hence, the central-tolerance checkpoint plays a key role in reducing the frequency of autoreactive cells in the naive, pre-immune B cell repertoire. The successfully rearranged BCR is expressed in an IgM membrane isoform and is tested for reactivity towards self-antigens at the immature B cell stage [96]. Non-self-reactive B cells egress from the bone marrow and initially, due to the alternative mRNA splicing, express IgM and IgD immunoglobulin isotypes on the surface. A later expression of other isotypes, such as IgG, is a result of the class-switch recombination and takes place outside of the bone marrow. IgD is mostly expressed on the cell surface in conjunction with IgM. The function of IgD is mostly unclear; however, differences in baseline signaling via IgD and IgM immunoglobulins were recently recognized. This suggests a role for IgD in B cell quiescence and differentiation restriction into autoantibody secreting cells [97]. Self-reactive B cells follow one of the four possible faiths depending on the degree of self-reactivity: - Programmed cell death and clonal deletion [98] - Receptor editing via RAG re-induction, replacing the self-reactive receptor before bone marrow egress [99, 100] - Anergy; a functionally unresponsive state with downregulated IgM expression in the periphery [101] - Antigenic ignorance while expressing both IgM and IgD isotypes on the surface [102] Recent studies show that receptor editing, rather than clonal deletion, is the main repertoire-modulating mechanism of bone marrow B cell development [103, 104]. Clonal deletion and anergy are concepts established using transgenic mice expressing hen egg-white lysozyme (HEL)-specific BCR crossed to mouse lines expressing membrane-bound or soluble form of the HEL, respectively [105, 106]. Furthermore, other transgenic models, including those with knocked-in neutralizing antibody specificities, seem to follow similar regulatory principles [98, 107, 108]. Regulation of B cell responsiveness by autoantigen-binding IgM and IgD surface molecules have recently been shown using nuclear receptor 77 (Nur77) reporter mouse model and allow for further studies of the polyclonal pre-immune repertoire [109, 110]. Immunoglobulin engineering In our studies, we use both, recombinant antibodies and specific B cells with an engineered immunoglobulin. In the recombinant antibody technology, variable chains of the antibody are sequenced and cloned into expression vectors that encode also the constant region with an isotype of choice. For the light chain and for the heavy chain, two expression vectors are then typically transfected into a human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) or a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) with derived cell lines for antibody production. Recombinant monoclonal antibody production has become a large category of biopharmaceuticals used in immunotherapy, included that of infectious diseases [111-114]. In basic research, the versatility of the technology allows for rapid sequence mutagenesis to generate, among other things, a high-probability unmutated common ancestor antibody for the study of its maturation pathways towards neutralization [115-117]. Antigenic exposure during LCMV infection, as opposed to soluble proteins, induces IgG2a antibody isotype in mice [118, 119]; however, recombinant antibody technology is not restrictive in this regard. For germline B cell immunoglobulin engineering, pronuclear injection of a foreign DNA into the single-cell stage mouse embryo was developed in the 1970-ties [120]. B cell receptor expression in genetically modified mouse models first depended on the heavy and light chain as transgenes (tg), randomly integrated into the genome. The second approach of precise immunoglobulin knock-in, originating in the 1990s, involves embryonic stem cells transfected with foreign DNA recombining via homology-directed repair (HDR). Multiple selection rounds proceed with identifying the HC or LC locus integrated clones before they are injected into blastocysts and implanted into a pseudo-pregnant foster mother [121, 122]. Mouse models generated by these ways were instrumental in elucidating tolerance mechanisms, such as central deletion [98, into peripheral niches [128, 129]. After 2009, immunoglobulin knock-in strategies created mouse models with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAb) against HIV, extending the knowledge of tolerance involvement in chronic viral infection [130-134]. Additionally, mouse models with knocked-in germline-reverted bnAbs laid ground for the understanding of BCR maturation in the context of sequential immunization [135-138] The limitations of the conventional techniques lie in the unproductive (transgenesis) and time-consuming (ES cell knock-in) nature, compared to the novel technique using CRISPR/Cas9 genetic scissors. Cas9 is a Streptococcus pyogenes-derived enzyme capable of introducing double-stranded breaks precisely, in the desired genomic position, as navigated by the guide RNA (gRNA) coupled to the enzyme [139-141]. This, together with HDR, ensures precise immunoglobulin gene integration with a single pronuclear injection and a rapid generation of genetically modified mice expressing desired BCRs [142-144]. With the emergence of CRISPR/Cas9, primary B cell engineering became a new territory that we and others decided to explore. Gene editing of T cells and hematopoietic stem cells for immune therapy is being established in the clinics [145, 146], with further CRISPR/Cas9 optimizations of the editing techniques ongoing [147, 148]. The fragility of the primary mouse B cells precluded in vitro manipulation prior to the CRISPR/Cas9 era. Even then, the first BCR-engineering techniques were optimized on cell lines, hybridomas or Cas9-expressing transgenic mice [149-152]. Human primary BCR engineering protocols were more rapidly established than those for mouse B cells [153-155]. Additionally, human B cells seem to be more permissive to genetic manipulation than mouse B cells [156, 157]; however, this is inconsistent and may depend on the way the cells are activated before transfection or infection with an antibody gene delivering virus [158]. Optimal in vitro activation protocols prevent B cell end-differentiation and isotype switch, which is an advantage for adoptive transfer studies of GC-dependent viral clearance [159]. During primary BCR rearrangements, immunoglobulin repair is mediated via NHEJ, whereas most of the CRISPR/Cas9 editing techniques rely on HDR. In other non-immune cells, the microhomology-mediated non-homologous repair is functional [160-164]. It is essential to optimize different B cell activation, transfection and infection protocols, gene templates and repair mechanisms in order to achieve primary BCR-engineering efficiencies and viability for mouse adoptive transfer experiments. The lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection model LCMV is an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus of the Arenaviridae family. There are 45 other viruses within the family that can infect mammals (Mammarenaviridae) [165]. Mammalian viruses are classified according to their regional origins into Old World viruses, including LCMV and Lassa virus, which are endemic in West Africa, and New World viruses found in South America [166-171]. Natural hosts of LCMV are rodents. In adult mice, transmission via blood, saliva, urine or feces, leads to a transient infection. A transplacental transmission of the virus causes a life-long asymptomatic persistence. LCMV has been found to be circulating among European rodent populations [172, 173]. Its seroprevalence in humans seems to be dependent on the potential of rodent contact and was reported worldwide [174-178]. Human LCMV infection can cause aseptic meningitis [179-182] in adults and, upon congenital infection, possibly fatal neural deficits [183-185]. Other viruses of the Arenaviridae family, such as the Lassa virus, can cause a lethal hemorrhagic fever [168, 186]. LCMV glycoprotein and neutralizing antibodies LCMV has now been used for almost 100 years to study viral persistence, immunological tolerance, and immunopathogenesis [187, 188]. The viral genome consists of two single-stranded negative-strand RNA segments, encoding the nucleoprotein (NP) and the glycoprotein (GP) on the short segment (S) and the viral polymerase (L) and matrix protein (Z) on the large segment (L) [189-191]. The RNA-binding NP is required for polymerase activity, while the Z protein is essential for viral budding [192-194]. The GP mediates attachment of the virions to the cells through -dystroglycan (-DG) as a receptor and membrane fusion with endosomes [195-197]. More recently, many tools have been developed in the experimental model to study B cells and antibody responses. Reverse genetics techniques allow for an assembly of \"design\" viruses directly from cDNA [198, 199]. Recombinant acute (Armstrong) and chronic (Clone 13) viruses, expressing the GP of the WE strain, are ideal for the studies involving B cell-mediated neutralization. Hence, a recombinant virus, rCl13/WE GP, is persistent but can be neutralized by the monoclonal antibodies KL25, WEN 1, WEN2, WEN3. KL25 is the most studied LCMV neutralizing antibody and was isolated from a BALB/c mouse after a sequential LCMV-WE immunization [31]. Genetically engineered BCR-transgenic models were generated bearing this specificity. Historically, KL25 HC and LC transgeneses were successfully expressed [29, 30], but only the HC gene was targeted to the immunoglobulin locus [200]. Despite the limitations, adoptive transfers of KL25 specific B cells provide new means to study neutralizing B cell responses. The neutralizing antibody KL25 binds to the only surface determinant of LCMV, the WE glycoprotein. Its complex (GPC) consists of a 44kDa GP1 globular head shielded by an array of a 35 kDa GP2 subunit, anchoring the GPC [201, A single amino acid change resulting from a \"hot-spot\" mutation in the GP1 subunit prevents epitope-binding and neutralization by the KL25 antibody in vitro [28]. The asparagine at position 119 of GP1 is particularly crucial in this regard. Several substitutions (N119S, N119K, N119D) can significantly decrease the binding of the KL25 antibody [28]. These mutations represent a viral escape, which is a consequence of applied selective pressure, when KL25 transgenic, cytotoxic T lymphocyte deficient mice are neonatally infected with the LCMV-WE virus [40, 203]. Analogously, we observe the same escapes forming upon an adoptive transfer of KL25 knock-in B cells into LCMV carriers. rCl13/WE GP carrying an N119S mutation can, therefore, be considered a low-affinity antigen for KL25 antibody or KL25 B cells. 1.

Abstract Persistent viral infections subvert key elements of adaptive immunity but the impact on germinal center (GC) B cell responses remains ill-defined. To compare GC B cell responses in chronic and acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection we exploited activation-induced deaminase (AID) fate-reporter mice and performed adoptive B cell transfer experiments. GC B cells of chronically infected mice were similarly hypermutated as those emerging from acute infection. Chronic infection yielded GC B cell responses of higher cellularity than acute infection, more memory B cell and antibody secreting cell output for longer periods of time and higher titers of protective neutralizing antibodies. These differences were supposedly driven by the persisting virus, warranting for an optimal representation of the late B cell repertoire in the serum immunoglobulin of chronically infected mice. Efficient mutational adaptation of B cells to viral escape variants attested to unimpaired GC functionality, and even in hypermutation-impaired AID-mutant mice chronic infection selected for GC B cells with hypermutated BCRs and neutralizing antibody formation. This demonstrates that, unlike for CD8+ T cells, chronic viral infection drives a functional, productive and protective GC B cell response. Protracted GC responses of high cellularity and productivity represent correlates of neutralizing antibody induction, which should be mimicked for B cell-based vaccination against persistent viral diseases. Introduction Persistent viral diseases such as HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection represent major global health challenges and affect several hundred million people worldwide [204-206]. A commonly held concept suggests that viral persistence requires subversion of the host's adaptive immune defense. CD8+ T cell exhaustion, caused by chronic antigenic stimulation, represents a paradigmatic example [26, 207, 208]. In contrast to T cells, the effects of chronic antigenic stimulation on B cell responses to persisting viruses remain less well defined. In chronic HBV and HIV infection, the B cell compartment is subject to phenotypic alterations, with an accumulation of atypical CD21negCD27neg memory B cells and plasmablasts in peripheral blood [209, 210]. In these patients, circulating antiviral B cells express a range of inhibitory receptors such as FcRL4 and PD-1 [210-212]. Moreover, HBV-specific B cells of chronically infected patients fail to differentiate into antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) upon in vitro re-stimulation and produce inadequate amounts of immunoglobulin, both of which can be partially restored by PD-1 blockade [210, 212]. Impaired antibody responses to vaccination with third-party antigens [213] and a shortened life-span of memory B cells [214] can be interpreted to reflect generalized suppression of the humoral immune system in HIV-infected individuals. Similarly, chronic LCMV infection in mice is associated with suppressed antibody responses to third-party antigens [23, 215]. Counterintuitively, however, significant LCMV nAb responses are typically elicited under conditions of chronic infection but only rarely when acute LCMV infection is efficiently cleared [33]. Analogously, broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAbs) responses to HIV itself are most commonly found in patients with long-term uncontrolled viremia [216]. These findings raised the possibility that, unlike for CD8 T cell responses, high levels of persisting viral antigen may result in an efficient antiviral GC B cell response. In line with this hypothesis, the spontaneous resolution of HBV infection is associated with the formation of protective anti-HBs antibodies [217], and evidence is accumulating that spontaneous HCV clearance relies on the timely formation of bnAbs [218-221]. Of note in this context, the envelope proteins of HIV, HCV and LCMV represent challenging targets for antibody neutralization owing to structural immune evasion features such as prominent glycan shields [41, 44, 222]. Accordingly, these viral envelope proteins commonly fail to induce potent neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses when presented to the immune system in the context of vaccination [44, 223-225], but they do so in the context of chronic infection [2, 27, 33, 216, 218-221]. Taken together, these observations raised the possibility that the humoral immune system meets the challenge of glycan-shielded antigens preferentially under conditions of chronic viremic infection. Such a response pattern - weak in vaccination and acute infection but potent in chronic infection - would seem counter-intuitive in light of the opposite findings for CD8 T cells. Only limited information is, however, available with regard to the functional efficiency of antiviral GC B cell responses in the chronic viral infection context. At the onset of LCMV infection antiviral B cells are largely deleted as a consequence of interferon-driven inflammation, a process also referred to as \"decimation\" [226-228]. In light of the finding that na\u00efve B cells can readily be recruited into an ongoing antiviral response [229, 230], we and others have proposed that antiviral B cell responses in the chronic phase of infection rely on a repertoire replenishment by new bone marrow emigrants [226, 229, 231]. Pioneering studies on chronic bacterial and parasitic infections have revealed striking deviations from the \"canonical\" B cell response as it has been defined in protein - adjuvant immunizations. A dominance of very low-affinity B cell clones at the onset of the response and their subsequent extrafollicular affinity maturation was observed in chronic murine salmonellosis [232]. In similar violation of commonly held concepts, hypermutated IgM+ memory B cells were found to dominate the recall response to Plasmodium parasites [233], altogether emphasizing the need to better understand how B cells respond to chronic microbial exposure. Here we set out to investigate how viral persistence impacts on the functionality of the GC B cell response. We report that the neutralizing capacity of murine LCMV envelope specific antibodies, as generated in the chronic infection context, requires their mutational maturation, analogously to human HIV and HCV neutralizing antibodies [234-239]. Most importantly, we found that chronic viremic infection drives a long-lived germinal center reaction with potent selection of hypermutated clones. The resulting output of memory B cells and plasma cells exceeded the cellular yields upon acute infection. In conclusion, our observations characterize the GC B cell responses underlying potent nAb formation in persistent viral infection. These insights should help to better mimic chronic infection when designing B cell-based vaccination approaches against persistent viral diseases. Results LCMV nAbs arise preferentially in chronic infection and require somatic hypermutation To compare B cell responses in acute and chronic infection we made use of two genetically engineered variants of LCMV, both carrying the identical LCMV-WE strain envelope glycoprotein (WE-GP) as sole target for nAbs. The two viruses are based on either the Armstrong (rARM) or Clone 13 backbone (rCl13) and differ in a single amino acid position of the polymerase gene, which is essential for rCl13 persistence [23]. High-dose i.v. infection with high-level viremia whereas rARM, administered intraperitoneally at lower doses, represents a prototypic model of acute aviremic infection (Fig. 1.1A) [26, 44, 240]). These two extremes of a spectrum, both in terms of antigen load and persistence, yet with identical antigenicity allowed us to study the impact of viral chronicity on antiviral B cell responses in general, and on the size and dynamics of the GC response in particular. When measuring antibodies against the highly glycosylated outer globular domain of WE-GP (GP-1) by ELISA, those developed continuously over a period of sixty days and reached significantly higher titers in rCl13- than in rARM-infected mice (Fig. 1.1B). Also, most rCl13-infected mice mounted nAbs by day 62, whereas rARM infection elicited detectable nAb responses in only a minority of animals and at lower titers (Fig. 1.1C). Altogether these findings confirmed earlier observations that protracted LCMV infection was a more potent driver of GP-1 binding and neutralizing Ab responses than acute infection [33]. For some acute viral infections such as influenza virus or vesicular stomatitis virus it has been shown that germline-encoded antibodies can potently neutralize and, accordingly, these responses can be mounted within a few days [241, 242]. Conversely, nAb responses to HIV or HCV typically take weeks to months before they arise [2, 243]. Isolated monoclonal nAbs are often substantially hypermutated and the ability of unmutated ancestor antibodies to bind and/or neutralize the respective virus can be limited or undetectable [234]. In light of the finding that LCMV nAb responses arose only between day 40 and day 60 after infection, we hypothesized that neutralizing activity required antibody maturation by hypermutation. To test this we studied two LCMV-neutralizing antibodies (WEN-1, WEN-3), which we reverted to their respective unmutated sequence (UA, WEN-1UA, WEN-3UA). WEN-1 and for HIV bnAbs [244]: The WEN-1 heavy chain features an extraordinary 25 amino acid-long CDR3 but diverges from its UA by only 7 amino acid changes, whereas the VH of WEN-3 stands out for its high mutational load (33 nt mutations, 16 amino acid divergence from its UA, Supplementary Fig. 1.1). Both WEN-1UA and WEN-3UA bound detectably to WE-GP but only did so at ~10-100-fold higher concentrations than their respective hypermutated wt antibody counterparts (Fig. 1.1D). In line with impaired binding, neither of the UA antibodies retained detectable virus neutralizing capacity (Fig. 1.1E). LCMV envelope-binding non-neutralizing antibodies may, however, still exert protective antiviral effects [28]. To test whether the UA antibodies may afford antiviral protection, we passively immunized rCl13-infected mice with either hypermutated or UA antibodies on day 3 after virus inoculation (Fig. 1.1F). When either one of the hypermutated antibodies was administered, viremia was effectively suppressed, resulting in clearance of rCl13 by day 15. In contrast, neither of the UA antibodies reduced viral loads to a detectable extent and all mice remained viremic throughout the observation period of 20 days. Taken together, these data indicated that hypermutation of LCMV glycoprotein-specific antibodies was required for potent binding, virus neutralization and antiviral protection. AID reporter system identifies LCMV-specific B cells in a polyclonal response To investigate the underlying cellular correlate of LCMV nAb formation we embarked on a comprehensive long-term study of the LCMV-specific GC B cell response in rCl13 and rARM infected mice. First, we set out to test whether our AID reporter mouse model (AIDrep [245]) was suitable for that purpose. AIDrep mice are hemizygous for an engineered aicda locus (naturally encoding for activation-induced (TAM-) Additionally, AIDrep EYFP reporter gene in the ROSA26 locus, such that TAM administration induces EYFP expression selectively in approximately 10-20% of (AID expressing) GC B cells [245]. Thereby, timed TAM administration allows for the fate mapping of the GC B cell compartment of a given time window including these cells' progeny. Within the population of EYFP-labelled cells we used GL7 and B220 staining to discriminate memory B cells (GL7-B220+), GC B cells (GL7+B220+) and plasma cells (GL7-B220-). In keeping with our earlier findings [246, 247] EYFP-reporting GL7+B220+ B cells in rARM- and rCl13-infected were CD38- and bound PNA, identifying them as GC B cells, while GL7-B220+ memory B cells exhibited an inverse staining pattern (Supplementary Fig. 1.2A,B). To test whether EYFP reporting identified virus-specific B cells, we infected AIDrep mice with rCl13, while control groups were given the antigenically unrelated vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or were left uninfected. TAM was administered to all mice on day 0, 5 and 10, with a resulting labeling window extending approximately from day 0 - day 15 after infection (Fig. 1.2A). When analyzed on day 50, ~20 % of EYFP-reporting B cells of rCl13- infected mice bound the LCMV nucleoprotein (NP) in flow cytometry (Fig. 1.2B,C, Supplementary Fig. 1.2), which was several-fold over background of VSV-infected or uninfected controls. Given that NP represents approximately 17% of the viral proteome, these numbers were compatible with a faithful labeling of LCMV-reactive B cells in AIDrep mice. To further assess whether EYFP-reporting B cells in AIDrep mice were indeed mostly LCMV-reactive we performed adoptive B cell transfer experiments (Fig. 1.2D). We infected AIDrep mice with either rCl13 or with Vaccinia virus (Vacc) on day 0, followed by TAM treatment as above. On day 30 we isolated splenic B cells from these donor mice, containing a population of supposedly rCl13- or Vacc-specific EYFP-labeled B cells, respectively. These (CD45.2+) B cells were adoptively transferred into syngeneic (CD45.1+) recipients, which had been infected with either rCl13 or Vacc beforehand. The recipients were infected ahead of the transfer rather than thereafter to avoid the \"decimation\" of adoptively transferred B cells by interferon-driven inflammation [226-228]. When analyzed six days after transfer, sizeable populations of EYFP+ CD138- B cells and EYFP+ CD138+ antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) were detected in rCl13-infected recipients but not Vacc-infected recipients of B cells from rCl13-infected donors and vice versa (Fig. 1.2E,F). This result confirmed that AIDrep mice identified mostly virus-specific B cells rather than non-specifically activated polyreactive B cells, validating the AIDrep mouse model for our ambitions to study LCMV-specific GC B cell responses. Chronic infection triggers a sustained GC response with prolonged plasma cell and memory B cell output To compare the generation and maintenance of B cell responses in chronic and acute viral infection, we inoculated groups of AIDrep mice with either rCl13 or rARM and treated them with TAM in a manner corresponding to labeling windows from day 0 - 10 (early), day 10 - 20 (intermediate) or day 30 - 40 (late), respectively (Fig. 1.3A). On day 60 after infection we enumerated EYFP+ ASCs (Fig. 1.3B, Supplementary Figure 1.3A, B). Thereby we assessed LCMV-specific B cells and plasma cells fulfilling two criteria: First, these cells or their precursors had expressed AID in the early, intermediate and late labeling windows, respectively. Secondly, they were still present at the d60 time point of analysis as either GC B cells, MemB cells or ASCs. This experimental approach did not, however, inform about the clonal relationship between cells labeled in different time windows. We found that EYFP+ GC B cells were approximately 3-fold more numerous in rCl13- than in rARM-infected mice, irrespectively of the TAM labeling window (Fig. 1.3C). Conversely, the total number of GC B cells in rARM- and rCl13-infected animals was not significantly different (Supplementary Figure 1.3C). This indicated that antiviral GC responses were maintained at lower levels in acute as compared to chronic infection, with a proportional reduction in cells that had expressed AID during the early, intermediate and late labeling windows (\"early-labeled\", \"intermediate-labeled\" and \"late-labeled\" cells). For the intermediate and late labeling windows, reduced virus-specific GC B cell responses in rARM- as compared to rCl13-infected mice were also reflected in a lower proportional representation of AID-reporting cells amongst total GC B cells (Supplementary Figure 1.3D). In contrast, early-labeled MemB cell (Fig. 1.3D) and early-labeled ASC (Fig. 1.3E) pools were of comparable size in rCl13 and rARM infected animals, suggesting that in the early phase after virus inoculation, the MemB cell and ASCs output of acute and chronic infection was comparable. With transition from the early to intermediate and late labeling windows, however, the MemB cell and ASC output of rARM-infected mice declined progressively, which contrasted with sustained levels in rCl13 infection. These observations found independent support in immunohistochemical analyses from spleens of early-labeled mice, showing that EYFP+ cells inside splenic GCs were more numerous in rCl13 than in rARM infection (Fig. 1.3F). Taken together these observations indicated that GC responses in chronic infection were sustained at higher levels over time and in the long-term drove higher MemB cell and ASC output than acute infection. Chronic infection is a potent long-term driver of B cell responses We aimed to corroborate the hypothesis that at intermediate to late time points after virus inoculation chronic infection was a more potent driver of B cell responses than acute infection. For this we performed adoptive transfer experiments with Cell Trace Violet- (CTV-) labeled B cells of AIDrep mice, which express the monoclonal LCMV envelope-specific B cell receptor KL25 from a heavy chain knock-in and a light chain transgene (KL25HL-AIDrep mice, CD45.1; Fig. 1.4A). Twenty days prior to transfer, the syngeneic (CD45.2) recipients were infected with genetically engineered rCl13 or rARM variants (rCl13*, rARM*) carrying the N121K point mutation in their WE-GP envelope protein (WE-GP*). This envelope variant is only poorly neutralized by the KL25 antibody owing to only intermediate affinity binding as opposed to high-affinity interaction with WE-GP [28]. Intermediate affinity B cell receptor interactions were chosen for these experiments with KL25HL-AIDrep B cells in order to facilitate affinity maturation and render the experimental conditions more physiological. For induction of the AID-driven Cre reporter the recipients were given TAM on the day of B cell transfer and again three days later (d20, d23). Within five days after adoptive transfer (d25), virtually all KL25HL-AIDrep B cells had diluted CTV in both, chronically and acutely infected mice (Supplementary Fig. 1.4), indicating antigen-driven proliferation [230]. The proportion of KL25HL-AIDrep cells, which had activated AID (EYFP+) and/or expressed the GC marker GL7, increased from d25 to d35 both in rCl13*- and rARM*-infected recipients (Fig. 1.4B, Supplementary Fig. 1.4). Also, the EYFP/GL7 subset distribution, i.e. the proportion of KL25HL-AIDrep B cells activating AID and participating in GC reactions, was similar in acutely and chronically infected mice. Importantly, however, the number of KL25HL-AIDrep B cell progeny recovered from chronically rCl13*-infected mice exceeded those emerging from rARM* infection by ~5-fold (Fig. 1.4C). These numeric differences manifested in the AID-reporting (EYFP+) and non-reporting (EYFP-) compartments and were similarly prominent for GC B cells (GL7+) as they were for MemB cells (GL7-). Accordingly, KL25HL-AIDrep B cells produced substantially higher antibody titers when transferred into chronically infected mice than upon transfer into acutely infected animals (Fig. 1.4D). This suggested that B cell clones recruited into the ongoing response or generated by hypermutation at later time points after infection were better represented in the serum immunoglobulin pool of chronically than acutely infected mice. Differential expansion of the adoptively transferred KL25HL-AIDrep B cell population was also evident at the histological level with markedly more EYFP+ KL25HL-AIDrep B cells inside GCs as well as outside GCs (Fig. 1.4E). In summary, these experiments established that in the time window from d20 - d35 after infection, virus-specific B cells expanded more vigorously in chronically than in acutely infected mice. They produced more antibody and yielded approximately five-fold more AID-reporting GC B cell and MemB cell progeny. Comparable VH and JH intron mutation frequencies in B cells of acutely and chronically infected mice Next we investigated whether chronic and acute infection settings differed in their ability to drive B cell hypermutation. We performed adoptive transfer experiments with KL25HL-AIDrep B cells on d20 after infection and sorted GL7+ GC B cell progeny on day 35 as outlined in Fig. 1.4A. We determined both, intronic sequences downstream of JH as a readout of overall AID activity in the transferred KL25HL-AIDrep B cells and also KL25 VH sequences as an indicator of affinity maturation. Neither of these target sequences provided clear evidence for a differential rate of hypermutation in acute as compared to chronic infection (Fig. 1.5A,B). This conclusion found independent support when we compared JH after rCl13 and rARM infection (Supplementary Fig. 1.5A,B). Hence we performed a detailed analysis of coding mutations in the KL25 VH region of KL25HL-AIDrep B cells emerging from acute and chronic infection. We found evidence for an enrichment of recurrent mutations both in complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FRs) of the BCR (Fig. 5C). When systematically analyzing these sequences for evidence of affinity maturation we noted three CDRH3 mutations (W104L, F106L, Y108S), which were found in at least four out of eight individual mice infected with either rARM* or rCl13* (bold red residues in Fig. 1.5C). With the exception of F106L, these recurrent CDRH3 mutations were found in KL25HL-AIDrep B cells recovered from chronically as well as from acutely infected animals. We recombinantly expressed the three KL25 point mutant antibodies with amino acid changes in CDRH3 (W104L, F106L and Y108S) and assessed their ability to bind WE-GP* and to neutralize the corresponding WE-GP*-expressing virus rCl13*. KL25-W104L was the most prevalent mutant antibody (7 out of 8 mice studied) and it bound considerably better to WE-GP* than to the parental KL25 antibody, while the latter was a better binder on WE-GP (Fig. 1.5D). Most importantly, KL25-W104L neutralized rCl13* more potently than KL25wt, altogether indicating that the W104L mutation was acquired as a result of affinity maturation on the WE-GP* envelope protein of the infecting rCl13* virus (Fig. 1.5E). Improved WE-GP* binding and rCl13* neutralization by KL25-W104L was acquired at the expense of a relative reduction in the antibody's capacity to bind and neutralize rCl13. Similar trends were also noted for the other two CDRH3 KL25 mutants (KL25-F106L, KL25-Y108S; Supplementary Fig. 5C-F). Taken together, these data suggested that KL25HL-AIDrep B cells underwent affinity maturation upon adoptive transfer into either rCl13* or rARM* infected mice, and that this process was at least equally efficient in chronic infection as it was in acute infection. Potent selection of hypermutated B cells in chronically infected mice We report here that the generation of LCMV nAbs depends on hypermutation (Fig. 1.1D-F), and that nAbs are preferentially mounted in chronic as opposed to acute infection (Fig. 1.1C, [33]). Moreover, we have previously shown that the formation of nAbs and also the control of chronic LCMV infection fail in aicda-/- mice lacking class switch recombination and affinity maturation [27]. Hence we aimed to test whether AID-driven hypermutation, which apparently functions efficiently in chronically infected mice (Fig. 1.5), is rate-limiting for nAb generation and virus control. As a model of hypermutation-impaired B cells we made use of gene-targeted mice, which carry one deleted and one G23S-mutated allele of aicda (AIDG23S/- mice, [248]). The AID-G23S mutation allows for class switch recombination while causing a substantial reduction in hypermutation rates [248]. We infected AIDG23S/- and wt control mice with rCl13 to follow viremia and nAb kinetics. To our surprise, rCl13 control in AIDG23S/- was only very modestly delayed, if at all (Fig. 1.6A). Also nAb responses followed similar kinetics as in wt mice, and reached comparable titers (Fig. 1.6B). Hence we sorted polyclonal GL7+ GC B cells on day 60 after infection for IgH locus sequencing. The analysis of JH intronic sequences as a readout of overall AID activity confirmed our expectations [248] of approximately 10-fold reduced mutation frequencies in AIDG23S/- mice (Fig. 1.6C). This difference between AIDG23S/- and wt mice persisted when excluding non-mutated sequences from the analysis (\"mutated introns\" in Fig. 1.6C) and was also reflected in a paucity of highly mutated clones (Fig. 1.6D). To understand how AIDG23S/- mice generated LCMV nAbs despite substantially reduced hypermutation frequencies, we determine the mutational burden in polyclonal VH sequences by unbiased high-throughput RNAseq. In marked contrast to the intronic sequences, a very modest 1.3-fold reduction in the number of VH mutations was observed in AIDG23S/- mice (Fig. 1.6E), with a fair representation of highly mutated clones (Fig. 1.6F). It therefore appeared that the efficient selection of mutated clones enabled the formation of nAbs and the control of rCl13 infection even in hypermutation-impaired AIDG23S/- mice. Taken together, these findings indicated that chronic infection provides a formidable selection machinery, which even under conditions of substantially reduced AID-driven mutation rates yields GC B cells with highly mutated VH sequences. Discussion Our study establishes that the humoral immune system and GC B cell responses in particular are very effective at coping with chronic viral antigen exposure. Long-lived GC B cell responses, efficient selection of hypermutated clones and high MemB cell and ASC output altogether argue against humoral immune subversion, a conclusion which finds independent support in the accompanying paper. Intriguingly, this response pattern reflects the opposite of CD8 T cell exhaustion, yet from an evolutionary standpoint seems logical and beneficial for the host. Exhaustion is commonly thought of as nature's strategy to avoid fatal immunopathological consequences of inflammatory cytokine release and overshooting T cell cytotoxicity [249]. nAb-mediated virus clearance, on the contrary, is an innocuous and virtually non-inflammatory process. Immune complex disease, the only known side-effect of humoral immune defense in chronic viral infection, is rare and may selectively occur in a subset of patients with genetic predispositions [250]. It therefore appears that with progression to the chronic phase of viral infection, the relative efficacy of humoral immune defense increases while CD8 T cell responses undergo exhaustion. Interestingly, the CD4 differentiation profiles that predominate under these respective conditions is predicted to support a shift from cellular to humoral immune defense: With progression to chronicity Th1 responses become exhausted [251-253], similarly to CD8+ T cells, while Tfh cells start to dominate the CD4 T cell response [254-256]. Chronic infection also favors the emergence of Tfh cells with distinct functional profiles such as the ability to co-produce IL-10 and IL-21 [257]. Accordingly, potent Tfh responses represent an essential component of efficient GC reactions in the chronic infection context [257-259]. Equally importantly, sustained high-level antigen supply for continuous B cell receptor signaling fosters potent GC B cell responses and likely is accountable for more sustained ASC output in rCl13-infected animals. Our observations help understand why nAbs to LCMV in mice, analogously to HIV and HCV in humans, are more readily elicited in chronic infection than upon acute infection or vaccination [33, 44, 216, 218-221, 223-225]. One widely held concept relates to the longer evolutionary trajectory of B cell receptors, which result from prolonged antigenic stimulation and continuous affinity maturation [260]. Our findings of comparable BCR hypermutation rates in chronically and acutely infected mice, although not contradictory to the above, suggest that additional mechanisms may be at work. (i) We propose that the continuously high ASC output even at late time points after the onset of chronic infection warrants for a better representation of the hypermutated GC B cell repertoire in the circulating serum antibody pool. Conversely, the hypermutated B cell pool emerging from acute infection would merely be available for accelerated nAb formation upon re-infection [230, 261]. The observation that not only rCl13- but also a few rARM-infected mice mounted nAb responses (Fig. 1.1C, right panel), supports this concept. It demonstrates that B clones of neutralizing capacity can be generated in acute infection, too. (ii) A second independent element that we assume is favoring nAb formation in chronic infection consists in the elevated cellularity of the GC B cell response. Studies in HIV-infected children as well as the search for minimally mutated HIV-bnAbs suggest that neutralizing B cell clones may be the product of a few serendipitous yet improbable mutations rather than of accumulated mutational load [235-238]. Similarly, HCV-bnAbs can apparently be generated with a limited number of critical somatic mutations [239]. A large pool of randomly mutated and efficiently selected B cell clones is therefore most likely to readily yield a few potently neutralizing ones. In line with this mechanism the accompanying paper describes that chronic infection results in higher intra-clonal diversification of responding B cells than acute infection. (iii) Last but not least, the combination of multiple weakly neutralizing antibodies can synergistically create substantial neutralizing activity [262-264]. Based on higher cellularity of the GC response and higher diversification (see above and accompanying paper), we expect chronic infection to yield a broader spectrum of virus-specific serum antibodies and therefore more synergy-based neutralizing activity than acute infection. A limitation of our study consists in its focus on B cells, without a concomitant analysis of CD4 T cell responses. Over the past years, however, a series of elegant studies have investigated the key contribution of Tfh cells to GC B cell responses in chronic LCMV infection, documenting also their impact on virus control [257-259]. Further, we acknowledge that our study focuses on late stages of infection, i.e. from three weeks after infection onwards. This choice was based on the late appearance of nAbs in rCl13-infected mice, with an intention to better understand the B cell correlate thereof. Accordingly, the present study complements previous reports from our lab and others, which have investigated B cell responses at the onset of LCMV infection [226-228]. Finally, LCMV infection in mice represents a versatile model to investigate the impact of chronic antigen load on immune responses, whereas other features of human infections such as the progressive loss of CD4+ T cells in human HIV infection are not recreated in the LCMV model but may also impact B cell responses. In summary, our findings and those in the accompanying paper characterize GC B cell responses as an imperturbable element of antiviral defense, which operates effectively and even excels when continuously faced with high amounts of viral antigen. Thereby our study portrays the natural context in which GC B cell responses yield potent nAbs or even bnAbs against persisting viruses, depicting also the challenges yet to be met when attempting to safely mimic these processes for prophylactic vaccination. Methods Mice and Ethics statement C57BL/6J wildtype mice were purchased from Charles River, France, CD45.1-congenic C57BL/6J have been obtained from the Swiss Immunological Mouse Repository, (SwImMR). AID-Cre-EYFP (AIDrep) a Cre-inducible EYFP reporter gene in the ROSA26 locus have been [245]. KL25HL mice, which express the monoclonal LCMV envelope-specific B cell receptor KL25 from a heavy chain knock-in and a light chain transgene, and KL25L mice, which express the light chain of the monoclonal LCMV envelope-specific B cell receptor KL25 as a transgene have been described [226]. KL25HL-AIDrep mice have been obtained by crossing AID-Cre-EYFP mice with KL25HL mice. AIDG23S mice (carrying a targeted G23S mutation on the aicda locus) were generously provided by Dr. T. Honjo [248]). F1 offspring resulting from the intercross of homozygous and homozygous AID-Cre-EYFP mice were used as hypermutation-impaired AIDG23S/- mice for experiments. All mice were on a C57BL/6 background and were bred at the Laboratory Animal Science Center (LASC) of the University of Zurich, Switzerland, under specific pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. Experiments were performed at the University of Basel and at the University of Geneva, in accordance with the Swiss law for animal protection and with authorizations from the Veterin\u00e4ramt Basel-Stadt and from the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la Sant\u00e9, Domaine de l'Exp\u00e9rimentation Animale of the Canton of Geneva, respectively. Assignment to experimental groups was based on sex- and age-matching. Adult animals of both genders were used to reduce the number of animals bred for research purposes. Study sample sizes in mouse experiments were chosen based on experience in our labs with respect to group sizes readily revealing biologically significant differences in the experimental models used. The groups were neither randomized nor were experiments conducted in a blinded fashion. Viruses and Cell Lines The recombinant LCMV strain Cl13 (rCl13) and Armstrong (rARM) expressing the surface glycoprotein of and variants (rCl13*, rARM*) have been described [44] and were engineered by standard procedures [198]. Recombinant Vaccinia virus expressing VSVG and vesicular stomatitis virus serotype Indiana (VSV) have been [265]. production titration BHK-21 cells (Clone BSC40 cells (ATCC) and NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC) were used and were confirmed to be mycoplasma-negative. Owing to their origin from renowned international repositories they were not authenticated. Flow cytometry and cell sorting Single cell suspensions were obtained from spleens by mechanical or enzymatic digestion. Spleens were harvested in PBS containing 5% FCS and for mechanical digestion spleens pushed through a metal mesh in a petri dish and homogenized by pipetting. For enzymatic digestion spleens where cut into small pieces and incubated with collagenase D (Roche) and DNaseI (Calbiochem) at 37\u00b0 C for one hour on magnetic rotators and then washed with PBS. Dead cells were excluded using the Zombie UVTM or Zombie YellowTM Fixable Viability Kits (BioLegend), then washed with PBS. The following fluorophore-conjugated antibodies were used for polyclonal rat IgG were added to the staining mixture to block Fc receptors. When adoptive cell transfers were performed, donor and recipient cells were distinguished using CD45.1- and CD45.2 - fluorophore-conjugated antibodies (Biolegend). Cells were co-stained for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C with combinations of the fluorophore- and biotin-conjugated antibodies and with fluorophore-conjugated streptavidin, then washed with FACS-Buffer. Subsequently, the cells were fixed using PBS containing 4% PFA. NP-binding cells were detected using a bacterially expressed, Alexa647-labelled recombinant NP [226, 230]. All media were adapted to mouse osmolarity. Labeled EYFP+ (AID- reporting) cells (see section \"mice\") were detected using an LSRFortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Absolute splenocyte counts of ARM-infected and Cl13-infected mice were indistinguishable when compared at either five or eight weeks after infection. For sorting of KL25HL-AIDrep B cell progeny, splenocytes were positively enriched for CD45.1+ cells by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec) following the provider's instructions. The cells the PBS containing 5% FCS (1'000 to 10'000 cells). Dried pellets were frozen in liquid nitrogen and DNA was prepared by cell lysis [266]. For sorting of AIDG23S/- GC B cells, 5'000 B220+GL7+ splenocytes from each mouse were sorted directly into TRI Reagent LS (Sigma-Aldrich). RNA was extracted as described below (see section \"high throughput sequencing\"). DNA was extracted using chloroform phase separation according to manufacturer's procedures (Sigma-Aldrich), yeast tRNA (Sigma-Aldrich) was added as a carrier. Cell sorting was performed using a FACSAria II cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). Adoptive B cell transfer, Tamoxifen and passive antibody administration For adoptive transfer of CD45.1+ KL25HL-AIDrep B cells, CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen) -labeled bulk splenocytes (2 x 106 cells per recipient) or purified B cells (2 x 105 cells per recipient) were injected intravenously in balance salt solution. B cells were purified by magnetic activated cell sorting using the Pan B Cell Isolation Kit for untouched B cells (Miltenyi Biotec). Syngenic (CD45.2+) C57BL/6J mice served as recipients for short-term transfers. Transfers of KL25HL cells for analysis >1 week later were performed in KL25L recipients to avoid rejection by anti-idiotypic responses [226]. For adoptive transfer of Vaccinia virus- or LCMV-experienced EYFP+ B cells we infected AIDrep mice on day 0 with the respective viruses, followed by tamoxifen treatment on day 0, 5 and 10. On day 30 splenic B cells were MACS-purified (Miltenyi Biotec Pan B Cell Isolation Kit for untouched B cells) and labeled with CTV. 2x106 - 8x106 B cells (purity > 95%) containing between 105 - 1.5x105 EYFP+ B cells were into Vaccinia Clinoleic (Baxter) was administered by gavage. Passive antibody administration was performed three days after infection by an intravenous bolus injection of 300 \u00b5g purified antibody in PBS. Immunohistochemistry and image analysis For the histological sections shown in Fig. 1.3, tissues were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck) for at least 4 hours at 4\u00b0C, then washed with PBS and cryoprotected with PBS-30% sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. Tissues were then embedded in Tissue-freezing-medium (Leica Microsystems) and frozen on dry ice. For the microsections shown on Fig 1.4, tissues were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde (Merck) for at least 4 hours at 4\u00b0C, then washed with PBS and embedded in paraffin. Immunostaining was performed on 3 m-thick sections using antibodies against GFP (ICL lab), Alexa Fluor 647-directly labeled Quenching Kit to remove autofluorescence signal (Vector Laboratories). Stained sections were scanned using a Panoramic Digital Slide Scanner 250 FLASH II (3DHISTECH) at 200 x magnification. Contrast was adapted using the \"levels\", \"curves\", \"brightness\" and \"contrast\" tools in Photoshop CS6. Viruses, virus production, titration and infection For LCMV batch production, BHK-21 cells (ATCC) were infected with the respective viruses at MOI = 0.01 and virus-containing supernatant was harvested 48 hours later. Recombinant Vaccinia virus expressing VSVG was produced on BSC-40 cells and vesicular stomatitis virus serotype Indiana (VSV) was grown on BHK-21 cells (MOI = 0.01 for 24 hours) [265]. LCMV infectivity in blood was determined by immunofocus assay [267]. In brief, blood was collected 1 IE/ml heparin (Na-heparin, Braun). Ten-fold serial dilutions were performed and were mixed 96-well plates and with NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC) in 24-well plates, followed by 3 hours of incubation at at 37\u00b0C. Then, overlay (1% methylcellulose in DMEM) was added and the cultures were incubated for two days. On the third day, supernatant was removed, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized (1% TritonX100 in PBS). infectious visualized using VL4 rat-anti-LCMV-NP antibody and secondary HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rat-IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), followed by a color reaction (DAB). rARM and rARM* infections were performed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 200 units (PFU). rCl13 and were administered and respectively. Determination of neutralizing antibody antibodies were measured in standard immunofocus assay-based [267] reduction neutralization tests. Serial two-fold dilutions of antibody-containing sera and of purified monoclonal antibodies were conducted in MEM 2% FCS in a 96-well format. Approximately 50 PFU of virus was added to each well, followed by 90 minutes of incubation at 37\u00b0C. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were added and incubated with the virus - antibody mixture at 37\u00b0C for 90 minutes, allowing the cells to adhere. Thereafter, overlay (1% methylcellulose in DMEM) was added. Two days later, infectious foci were identified as described for the LCMV immunofocus assay. Neutralizing titers in mouse sera were determined as the highest serum dilution yielding at least 50% focus formation reduction. For monoclonal antibodies, the number of infectious foci at a given antibody concentration was expressed as a percentage of the number of foci in control wells without antibody added. Analysis of somatic mutations at the IgH locus The JH4 intronic sequence flanking rearranged VH gene segments was amplified by PCR from DNA of sorted B cell subsets, from 10,000 to 1,000 cells. The PCR primers used are: in 5', a mixture of five (JH4rev: CACCAGACCTCTCTAGACAGC), with a nested amplification performed in cases of low cell numbers (using JH4-nested: TGAGACCGAGGCTAGATGCC and the same VH primer set) (2 min at 98\u00b0C and 50 cycles of 15 s at 98\u00b0C, 30 s at 64\u00b0C and 30 s at 72\u00b0C, with Phusion\u00ae DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs); or 30 cycles plus 25 additional cycles in cases of nested PCR). Mutations were determined within 448 base pairs of the JH4 intron. For knock-in performed: one encompassing the VHDJH2 (V1-53) coding sequence, and the other one based on the flanking intronic sequence, consisting in a fused JH2-JH4 segment present in the knock-in construct, using the following (2 min at 98\u00b0C and 40 cycles of 15 s at 98\u00b0C, 30 s at 64\u00b0C and 30 s at 72\u00b0C). Mutations were determined for the 324 bp sequence of the VH gene (including CDR3), and for 570 bp of the intronic sequence, immediately downstream of JH2. PCR products were cloned with the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequences were determined with an ABI Prism 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. Mutations were analyzed with the help of the CodonCode Aligner software. Between 16 to 91 sequences per sample were determined for mutation frequency determination. High throughput sequencing Preparation of antibody libraries from rCl13-infected wt and AIDG23S/- mice: Library preparation by RT-PCR was performed similar to the protocol described in Menzel et al. [268]. Total RNA was extracted (25 L elution volume) using the TRIzol Plus RNA Purification Kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with AccuScript High-Fidelity (Agilent Technologies) using total RNA and primers (Thermo Scientific) following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR- amplification was performed with Q5 Hot Start High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) in 50 L reaction volumes with adjusted cycle numbers. For the eight germinal center samples an IgG-specific reverse primer was used. PCR1 products were purified using SPRI select beads (Beckman Coulter) at a ratio of 0.8X (elution in 30 L water). Purified PCR1 products were submitted to PCR2-amplification, which adds full-length Illumina adapters to the library. were gel-purified from 1% agarose gels. All amplicon libraries were quantified qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems). Based on qPCR results, samples were diluted to 7 nM concentrations and a pool was prepared with equal amounts of library. Last, the pool was checked on a Fragment Analyzer (DNF-486 High Sensitivity NGS Fragment Analysis Kit, Advanced Analytical), the exact concentration determined (Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer) and diluted to a final concentration of nM. Illumina sequencing and data preprocessing: Illumina MiSeq sequencing was performed using 2x300 bp reads. Forward and reverse reads were paired using PANDAseq (Version 2.7, [2]) with parameter -0 300. Full length VDJ region annotation and somatic mutation enumeration of successfully paired sequences was performed using ImMunoGeneTics (IMGT)/HighV-QUEST [3, 4]. For downstream analyses, sequences were pre-processed and reads only retained based on the following criteria: (i) the IMGT-indicated \"Functionality\" of the sequencing was \"productive\"; (ii) CDR3s were of minimal length of 4 amino acids; (iii) CDR3 were present with a minimum abundance of 2. Nucleotide mutation numbers were based on IMGT. Number of reads in analyses shown ranged between 1.3 and 1.5x106 per individual across both C57BL/6 and AIDG23S/- mice. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), recombinant proteins and monoclonal antibodies GP-1-binding antibodies in mouse serum were determined using recombinant HEK293 cell-derived GP-1-Fc fusion protein as a substrate the KL25-Y108S determined using a synthetic HEK293 cell-derived fusion protein consisting of the extracellular WE-GP and domains, respectively, fused to human Fc WE-GP*-Fc, [28]). For the aforementioned ELISA assay formats, 96-well high binding plates (Greiner Bio-One) were coated 0.7 \u00b5g/ml goat anti-human NaHCO3 35mM, pH9.6) at 4\u00b0C overnight. Then, the plates were blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with PBS / 0.05% Tween / 5% milk (also used as buffer in the subsequent steps). Subsequently, GP-1-Fc, WE-GP-Fc or WE-GP*-Fc was added and incubated for 1h, followed by three wash steps with PBS / 0.05% Tween (PBS-T). Serum samples or monoclonal antibodies were added in a serially diluted manner and were incubated for 1h at RT. Following three more PBS-T wash steps, goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate antibody (1:750, Jackson) was added. Excess secondary antibody was washed away and HRP activity was detected using ABTS as a chromogen (Pierce). OD405 was determined in an ELISA reader. The GP-binding capacity of WEN-1, WEN-1UA, WEN-3 and WEN-3UA was determined using as an ELISA substrate a HEK293-derived extracellular WE-GP domain with a C-terminal The ELISA assay was performed analogously to the above, except that GP-Streptag was captured by coating ELISA plates with 0.5ug/ml of Strep-TactinXT (Iba), and that the plates were blocked with 0.2% BSA in PBS. Monoclonal antibodies 1.1 [32, 33]) were identified by IgBlast (IgBlast) sequence analysis. All mutations deviating from the closest germline V(D)J heavy (HC) and light chain (LC) sequences were reverted. The corresponding cDNAs were synthesized (Genscript) and introduced into HC and LC expression cassettes for recombinant expression in a mouse IgG1 format (provided by Dr. Shozo Izui, University of Geneva). The antibodies were produced by transient co-transfection of the HC and LC expression plasmids in CHO cells (Protein Expression Core Facility, PECF, of the Swiss Federal Technical Highschool, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). The antibodies were purified on an \u00c4KTAprime plus purification system using Protein G columns (GE healthcare). After 24 hours of PBS dialysis, the purified antibodies were quantified by IgG ELISA. MOPC-21 (BioXcell) served as isotype control antibody. The KL25-W104L, KL25-F106L and KL25-Y108S antibodies as well as a matching KL25 wildtype control antibody were obtained by analogous procedures, except that a mouse IgG2a expression format was used for these experiments. Statistical Analysis The GraphPad Prism software version 7 (GraphPad Software) was used for all statistical analyses. Unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests were performed to compare one parameter between two groups. For comparison of one parameter between multiple groups one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and for comparison of multiple parameters between two or more groups two-way ANOVA was used, both followed by Bonferroni's post-test for multiple comparison. For statistical analysis of absolute cell counts, values were log- converted to obtain a near-normal distribution. P values 0.05 were regarded as not statistically significant (ns), p values < 0.05 as significant (*, #) and p < 0.01 as highly significant (**, ##). The number of experimental animals \"n\" per group, number of experimental repeats \"N\", the type of error bar displayed and the tests performed for statistical analysis are indicated in each figure legend. ELISA quantification and curve fitting For titer determination in mouse serum based on standard curve fit, GEN5 software (BioTek Instruments) was used. Binding and neutralization curves of monoclonal antibodies were fitted using GraphPad Prism software 7 (GraphPad Prism).

Protective antibodies against chronic systemic viral infection emerge from an IgMlow B cell population pruned by RAG2 Affilitiations 1 Department of Biomedicine - Haus Petersplatz, Division of Experimental Virology, University of Basel, 4009 Basel, Switzerland. 2 Nuffield Department of Clinical Medicine, Division of Structural Biology, University of Oxford, OX3 7BN Oxford, United Kingdom Corresponding author: Daniel D. Pinschewer, Department of Biomedicine - Haus Petersplatz, Division of Experimental Virology, University of Basel, 4009 Basel, Switzerland. Daniel.Pinschewer@unibas.ch One sentence summary IgMlow, IgD+ phenotype and restricted peripheral egress of virus specific B cells is a direct consequence of their ability to bind the viral glycoprotein. Abstract Protective neutralizing antibodies against chronic viral pathogens arise late after the onset of the infection and are not trivial to elicit with immunization. Both in the polyclonal B cell repertoire and upon characterizing the newly generated neutralizing antibody, KL25 heavy and light chain knock-in mice, expressing B cells with high affinity to the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) glycoprotein (GP), we observed an IgM molecule downregulation on the surface of the na\u00efve B cells that was indirectly proportional to the LCMV GP binding. IgMlow IgD+ phenotype did not negatively affect the activation potential, adaptation and antibody production upon germinal center entry of the GP-binding B cells in chronic viral infection; however, RAG2-dependent negative selection during light-chain receptor editing renders glycoprotein binding specificity a rare phenomenon in the peripheral B cell repertoire. Introduction Multiple chronic viral infections in humans, such as HIV and HCV, and an experimental mouse lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) have a common denominator in a delayed neutralizing antibody formation [269], [33, 243]. In addition, can depend on a very limited starting B cell repertoire [270, 271] One of the hypotheses that provide explanations for both low viral antigen immunogenicity and low precursor frequency is viral host antigen mimicry, whereby structural similarity between the viral and endogenous host antigens leads to an immune response dysregulation. In this context, a limited interaction with heavily glycosylated viral epitopes of the envelope glycoproteins [41, 44] [272] as well as immune tolerance as a barrier in neutralizing antibody development [108] have been recognized. However, only B-cell receptor (BCR) engineered mouse models expressing virus neutralizing specificities can address the relevant functional and regulatory context of the host immune response. The penetrance of a specific virus-neutralizing BCR in BCR knock-in animals into the pool of the peripheral B cells can vary depending on a mouse model and ranges from complete abrogation of specific B cells by the central check-point deletion [130] to a largely physiological B cell development [273]. Additionally, virus specific B cells have a spectrum of functionality or can remain anergic [110]. Immunoglobulin gene knock-in strategy from gene expression and ensures physiological germinal centre affinity maturation. It relies on the employment of homology-directed repair, with the respective rearranged V(D)J cassettes, replacing J segments of immunoglobulin heavy or kappa loci [121]. More recently, the use CRISPR/Cas 9 genetic scissors allows for performing analogous targeting strategies rapidly.[142] [144] In the model of chronic LCMV infection, antibodies elicited later, rather than early, in the infection course are neutralizing [33, 34]. In particular KL25 specificity, induced as a result of a sequential immunization, was pivotal for the recent studies of B cell response subversion in the context of chronic LCMV infection and adoptive B cell transfers [30]. Here we report a rare phonotype of LCMV GP1 binding B cells, using a newly generated HkiL mouse and their functionality in chronic LCMV infection. Results Generation of LCMV neutralizing antibody knock-in mouse model KL25 neutralizing antibody heavy chain (HC) knock-in was previously generated via homologous recombination to replace the DQ52 and JH segments of the endogenous immunoglobulin locus on chromosome 6 of the wild type (WT) C457BL/6 mouse [200]. We crossed these mice to C57BL/6 RAG2 knock-out mice, resulting in the TgH-RAG2 strain, which served as a background strain for further genetic manipulation, creating a condition where no B cells are present in the periphery, unless the light chain (LC) gene is inserted into the genome for BCR expression. In the closest possible proximity to the homology arms, we designed two guide RNAs navigating the double-stranded break induced by CRISPR/Cas 9 ribonucleoprotein, deleting the IgK J segments of chromosome 12. The guide RNAs were tested for cutting efficiency in vitro. The homology-directed repair ensured an insertion of the KL25 LC cassette consisting of the antibody VJ region with its native promoter (Fig. 2.1A). Fertilized oocytes were injected with the Cas9 RNPs and a plasmid template and implanted for a surrogate pregnancy, yielding 4 out of 11 founder animals with the KL25 LC knock-in. As measured by flow cytometry, the presence of B cells in blood serves as a simple detection method for identifying the founders (Fig. 2.1B). In addition, to confirm the precise integration, we performed a long-range PCR with primers inside the cassette and outside in the genomic region (Fig 2.1A,C). To confirm the specificity of the knocked-in BCR we developed a flow cytometric co-staining with two different recombinant LCMV glycoprotein, one consisting of the trimeric GP complex (GPC), and GP1 subunit only, we could confirm the strict monoclonality of the peripheral B cells of the founder animal bind the LCMV GP1 subunit in isolation and not only in the GP1-GP2 heterodimeric context (Fig 1D). We named this newly created KL25 expressing mouse line HkiL-Rag and crossed it to WT C57BL/6 Ly5.1 mice to restore RAG 2 expression in the HkiL mouse line. Analogously to the above, we used the KL25 antibody heavy chain to develop a molecular strategy for immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC) knock-in targeting by CRISPR/Cas9 and flow cytometry-based identification of founder animals using the aforementioned GP staining (Appendix 1). IgM downregulation is characteristic of the phenotype of GP1 binding B cells in blood and lymphoid organs Previous mouse lines generated to express KL25 BCR relied on LC being expressed from a randomly integrated transgene. Examples are the TgHL [30] and BasL36 lines (Narr K., et al. unpublished). We set out to compare the peripheral B cell repertoire of these several mouse models expressing a monoclonal repertoire of KL25 expressing B cells (Table 1). Both HkiL-Rag and BasL36 mice exhibited high levels of KL25 BCR expression in and strictly monoclonal population of peripheral B cells (Fig. 2.2A), with more than 99% of the splenic B cells being specific TgHL mice with LC transgene has a lower KL25 expression of approximately 60% (Fig. 2.2B). In HKiL mice, The RAG2 sufficiency had no detectable effect on the monoclonality of the B cells in the periphery (Fig. 2.2C). As compared to C57BL/6 WT mice, the number of B cells in the spleen and periphery was slightly reduced for all of the transgenic animals, with up to 2.5-fold reduction in HkiL mice (Fig. 2.2D, Sup. Fig. 2.1B). A reduction in the peripheral B cell compartment of BCR-transgenic mouse models can be accounted for by autoreactive specificities. Hence, we further analyzed the B lymphocytes for their levels of surface IgM expression. We observed that GP1 binding B cells of monoclonal Basl36 and HkiL-Rag mice exhibited a strong downregulation of surface IgM, both in blood (Fig. 2.2 E,F) and spleen (Sup. Fig 2.1C, D). Additionally, the B cell compartments commonly characterized by IgM expression, were depleted. This affected germinal center B cells (B220+, CD23-, CD21+) (Fig. 2.2G, Sup. fig. 2.1E) with only 5% of the splenic B cells of HkiL mice expressing the CD21 marker (Fig.2H). Due to their anatomic location, marginal zone B cells are considered the first T-independent line of defense against bloodborne pathogens, while follicular B cells are associated with secondary high-affinity antigen interactions [274]. Analogously, IgM expression is characteristic of the B1 B cell population in the peritoneal cavity. We found that HkiL B cells do not differentiate into B1(B220+, CD11b+) B cells (Fig. 2.2H, I). The contribution of BCR signaling to these HkiL differentiation pathways remains to be investigated. Taken together, the peripheral B cells of BasL36 and HkiL mice expressing neutralizing specificity have IgMlow, IgD+ phenotype and fail to differentiate into compartments, where antibody production is rapid and independent of T cell help. IgM downregulation rather than secondary V(D)J rearrangement characterize the bone marrow development of HkiL B cells Since the monoclonal B cells in the periphery were found to be of a strict IgMlow IgD+ phenotype, flow cytometry was used to examine the bone marrow (BM) development of the KL25 specific B cells (BasL36, HkiL), to investigate a potential contribution of central tolerance mechanisms on this phenotype. IgM expression is crucial for central tolerance check-point and secondary V(D)J rearrangement, or receptor editing, occurs in the IgM-expressing stage of immature B cells in the bone marrow[275]. Therefore, we specifically looked at the E (immature B cell) and F (mature B cell) fractions of the bone marrow (BM) B cells [276], which have been defined based on B220 and IgM expression. We observed no difference in the size of the total late mature BM B cell population (B220high, CD43-) of RAG2-sufficient KL25 B cells when compared to WT mice. In contrast, the immature B cell subpopulation (B220int, CD43-) was significantly reduced in KL25 expressing B cells (Fig. 2.3A). Additionally, the IgM expression of this sub-population, undergoing tolerance check-point, was lower than that of WT mice, with subsequent further downregulation at the pre-egressing mature B cell population (Fig. 2.3B). Hence, we identified that the IgM downregulation was imprinted early at the To investigate whether other BCR transgenic models available to us, namely vesicular stomatitis virus-specific (VI10) and hen-egg lysozyme specific (MD4) B cells, exhibit similar alterations in their B cell development, namely premature IgM downregulation, we stained splenocytes of MD4 and VI10 mice for IgM/IgD expression and LCMV GP binding (Fig. 3C). Both IgM and IgD, were expressed on the surface of the splenic B cells (Fig. 2.3C), and these B cells did not bind LCMV GP, as expected (Fig.D). Additionally, the bone marrow development in these models included a B220int, IgMhigh stage, before IgD was upregulated on the surface of pre-egressing B cells (B220high, CD43-)(Fig. 3E, F). These findings suggested that LCMV GP1 specific B cells follow an unusual bone marrow development, characterized by very transient or almost absent IgM expression as previously found for certain autoreactive BCR specificities (REFS). In contrast to the findings reported from these BCR transgenic / knock-in models with known autoreactivity, however, RAG-competent HkiL B cells did not undergo BCR rearrangement that would have measurably altered their specificity. IgM downregulation correlates with LCMV GP1 binding and is restored upon B cell activation Inhomogeneous levels of GP1 binding by TgHL B cells revealed an inverse correlation between LCMV GP1 binding and IgM expression (Fig. 2.4A blue). HkiL B cells represented an extreme of this spectrum in terms of GP1 binding and IgM downregulation (Fig. 4A, red). IgMlow, IgD+ B cells have previously been described as anergic or were found to respond only when stimulated with high-affinity antigen. Therefore, we set out to investigate whether HkiL B cells can are responsive to stimulation. We co-cultured HkiL B cells with fibroblasts stably expressing CD40L and Baff [159], which in conjunction with added soluble IL-4 simulate antigen independent T cell help and stimulate B cell proliferation and memory formation (REF). Both IgM and IgD were upregulated on the surface of HkiL B cells after 4 days of co-culture (Fig. 2.4B), alongside elevated levels of the activation markers CD86 and Fas (Fig.2. 4C). To determine whether the lack of IgM expression on B cells of HkiL mice was due to the animals' monoclonal B cell repertoire, and to test these cells' survival in polyclonal WT recipients, we transferred 1 million HkiL or WT B cells, expressing the CD45.1 congenic marker, into na\u00efve CD45.2 recipients. During the observation period of seven days, there was no change in the IgD/IgM profile (Fig. 4D) of the transferred HkiL cells, and they homed to the spleen and survived comparably to WT cells, as evident in equal numbers of HkiL and WT B-cells recovered on day 7 (Fig. 2.4E) When we modified the transfer settings, and the HkiL B cells were transferred into chronically LCMV-infected recipients, we observed almost immediate IgM upregulation on day 1, followed by loss of both, IgM and IgD by day 7, supposedly as a result of isotype class switch (Fig. 2.4F). Taken together, KL25 BCR-transgenic and -knock-in B cells downregulate IgM as a function of GP1-binding but re-express IgM upon activation in vivo and in vitro by antigen-independent and -dependent stimulation, respectively. KL25-expressing IgMlow B cells enter germinal centers and produce antibody in chronic viral infection To assess the functionality of KL25 B cells in chronic LCMV infection, we inoculated CD45.2+ recipients with rCl13/WE-GP and six days later transferred 5x10e3 CD45.1+ KL25 B cells (Fig. 2.5A), which results in approximately 250 cells engrafted in spleen. HkiL, BasL36 and TgHL B cells were used in parallel for this assessment. The experimental setting was chosen to ensure high-affinity BCR interaction and allowed KL25 to neutralize the virus. Within 7 days after adoptive transfer, all types of transferred B220+ B cells had measurably expanded in spleen (Fig. 2.5B). However, the expansion capacity was different, depending on the donor mouse type. The expansion and the long term maintenance was significantly lower for the previously published TgHL mice (Fig. 2.5C, E), with differences obvious already on d7, when TgHL B cells accounted for only ~0.2% of splenic B cells, as opposed to HkiL-Rag and BasL36 cells amounting to ~0.9% and ~1.8%, respectively (Fig. 5D). All types of KL25 B cells participate in the germinal center reaction, as evident in up to 80% and ~97% of the transfered B cells exhibiting a GL-7+ CD38+ phenotype on day 7 and day 54, respectively (Fig. 2.5F). While there was no obvious difference in the capacity of the various donor cell types to undergo isotype class switch (Fig. 5G), KL25 antibody production (determined as anti-GP1 titers by ELISA) differed substantially between them. They were highest in recipients of HkiL-Rag B cells, supposedly as a result of immunoglobulin expression from the natural IgH and IgK loci, followed by BasL36 and TgHL (Fig. 2.5H). To assess whether KL25 B cells can be triggered by low affinity antigen, we used rCl13 WE virus with a mutation in the GP, N119S, which arises from the selective pressure of GP binding B cells in viral escapes [28]. We confirmed the minimal binding of the mutated N119S GP to the KL25 antibody (Fig. 2.5I) and designed an experiment, where animals were infected with the rCl13 WE N119S virus and transferred KL25 specific B cells 6 days later (Fig. 5J). To prevent a possible adaptation disadvantage of the donor HkiL or BasL36 B cells, we also restricted the number of KL25 HC genes to one, as opposed to the bi-allelic expression in HkiL-Rag, creating a physiological immunoglobulin in HkiL-Rag het mice. Prior to transfer, HkiL Rag B cells bound both WE and WE N119S GP, albeit to a lower extend for the later (Fig. 2.5K). The ability of the B cells to adapt to the lower-affinity virus escape variant was unique for the mouse models with the LC targeted in the immunoglobulin locus, HkiL-Rag, HkiL Rag Het, as measured by the serum antibodies binding N119S GP in Elisa (Fig. 2.5L). Correct LC gene regulation withing the IgK locus is essential for the formation of the neutralizing antibodies, since only HkiL-Rag and HkiL-Rag het, but not BasL36 were able to mount a neutralizing antibody response. Moreover, the time and extend of it is dependent on the singular expression of the immunoglobulin genes, as HkiL-Rag Het donor cells produce higher neutralizing titer, sooner, on day 24 post transfer (Fig. 2.5M). Taken together, our findings demonstrate the importance of precise knock-in strategies for the correct expression and regulation of the antibody genes in the viral infection studies and adaptability of LC knock-in but not LC transgenic B cells to the low-affinity virus. Rare GP1 binding B-cells in oligoclonal and polyclonal repertoires downregulate IgM and report elevated levels of baseline BCR signaling The KL25 BCR has undergone substantial affinity maturation from ist unmutated common ancestor. Hence, we investigated whether a GP1-binding B cells in the na\u00efve polyclonal B cell repertoire exhibit an analogous phenotype. In the polyclonal B cell population of wild type, GP1 binding cells (GPC+/GP1+) were undetectable (Fig. 2.6A, B). A restriction of B cell specificities by bi-allelic knock-in of the KL25 heavy but not light chain (TgH mice) leads to the enrichment of both GPC (GPC+/GP1-) and GP1 (GPC+/GP1+) binding cells (Fig. 2.6C). GPC-only binding cells (GP1-) exhibited very high surface IgM, indicating it was not the KL25 heavy chain per se that dictated surface IgM levels but the antigenic specificity, which depended on endogenous light chain resulted in a 10-fold enrichment of GP1-binding B cells as compared to TgH RAG2+/+ mice (Fig. 2.6E). Therefore, RAG2 availability, which supposedly represents a rate-limiting factor for BCR editing, limited the egress of an thereby the availability of GP1- binding B cells in the peripheral BCR repertoire of TgH mice (Fig. 2.6C, E). Analogous to GP1-binding B cells of WT mice, GP1-binding B cells of TgH RAG2+/+ and mice an IgMlow surface phenotype (Fig. 2.6D, F). This phenotype was most pronounced in HkiL mice expressing high levels of both KL25 HC and LC (Fig. 2.6G, H). Low surface IgM levels are only one hallmark of phenotype. The orphan nuclear receptor Nur77 is activated by tonic BCR signaling and was found to be upregulated on self-antigen specific B cells [109]. Hence, we crossed TgH mice to Nur77-GFP BAC-transgenic reporter mice [277], where eGFP under control of the Nur77 regulatory context, serves as a surrogate for self-reactivity. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated elevated GFP reporting in naive GP1-binding cells as compared to GPC+/GP- and GPC-GP1- B cells in the same animals, indicating that the BCR of naive GP1+ cells provide elevated tonic stimulation (Fig. 2.6I). We set out to characterize endogenous light chains the pair with the knocked-in KL25 heavy chain of TgH RAG2+/+ mice to result in GP1 binding (GPC-/GP1+) cells (Fig. 6I). We identified 5 different variable-joining region (VJ) rearrangements, which included the unmutated common ancestor LC of KL25. When recombinantly expressed, the antibodies consisting of the KL25 HC and these endogenously paired LCs bound GPC as well as GP1, as expected (Fig. 2.6J, K). The highest-affinity antibody amongst them, based on the IGKV14-111 LC V element, even modestly reduced viral infection in the in vitro plaque reduction assay (Fig. 2.6L, M) and in vivo upon passive antibody therapy (Fig. 2.6N). We demonstrate that multiple BCR rearrangements binding to GP1 lead to the downregulation of IgM and the upregulation of Nur77 receptor. GP1-binding IgMlow B cells but not GPC-only-binding IgMhigh B cells control chronic LCMV infection With HkiL B cells being efficient in clearing chronic infection, we tested the relative antiviral efficiency of GPC+/GP1- B cells (IgMhigh, IgDlow phenotype) and of GPC-/GP1+ B cells (IgMint/low, IgD+). For this, we sorted three groups of TgH B cells according to their GP-binding capacity (GPC-/GP1-, GPC+/GP1-, GPC+/GP1+; Fig. 2.7A) and transferred 10 000 of either cell subsets into Cl13 WE infected animals. HkiL B cells (IgMlow/ IgD+) served as positive control, negative control mice were left without adoptive cell transfer (Fig. 2.7B). In the first 14 days after adoptive transfer GP1-binding antibody responses were only detectable in recipients of GPC+/GP1+ TgH B cells or of HkiL B cells, confirming that the sorting according to surface antigen binding corresponded to the specificity of antibodies produced by the B cells (Fig. 2.7C). HkiL B cells were most effective at clearing chronic LCMV infection upon transfer. Additionally, the transfer of GPC+/GP1+ binding cells but not of GPC+/GP1- binding B cells resulted in the premature clearance of LCMV from blood (Fig. 2.7D). As judged based on the cloned BCRs, GPC-/ GP1+ TgH B cells commonly have a lower GP1 binding affinity than HkiL B cells, yet, which may be due to longer-term antigen exposure of the former, they expand to a higher extend on day 31. (Fig. 2.7E). In case of the former this may be due to rapid elimination of the cells' cognate antigen, while the latter cells' expansion likely was hampered by poor antigen recognition. All donor cell types enter germinal centres, and we noted a trend for the proportion of cells in GCs on day 31 binding and affinity (Fig. 2.7F). On day 25 post-transfer, a higher proportion of high-affinity, IgMlow HkiL B cells had differentiated into isotype switched memory B cells than of any of the TgH cell subset. In contrast, HkiL B cell progeny contained the lowest proportion of CD138+ antibody secreting cells in spleen (Fig. 2.7G, H), and also low-affinity GPC+/GP1+ TgH B cells exhibited significantly lower proportions of CD138+ B cells progeny than GPC-/GP1- B cells (Fig. 2.7H). Taken together, these results demonstrated efficient LCMV control by GP1- binding IgMlow B cells Discussion We report a particular phenotypic signature of LCMV GP1 binding B cells, characterized by the IgM downregulation, present already in the immature B cell stage in the bone marrow. In addition to this, we observe a RAG2 dependent reduction of the GP1 binding B cell repertoire in both monoclonal HkiL, and the TgH mice when pairing endogenous light chains. Given that virtually 100% of B cells in heterozygous HkiL and BasL36 mice bind GP1 and there is no substantial reduction of peripheral B lymphocyte counts in the BasL36 mouse model with the LC as a transgene, the decrease in B cell number is unlikely a result of incomplete allelic exclusion or aberrant heavy chain rearrangement. The receptor editing, on the other hand, is thought to happen at the immature/mature stage of the B cell development and be largely dependant on the LC secondary rearrangement [278]. Upon monoallelic deletion of the RAG 2 gene, decreased receptor editing leads to an enrichment in GP1 binding population. The nature of the LC knock-in in HkiL mice, deleting all J elements and thus prohibiting VJ rearrangement, results in a peripheral B cell reduction, since editing-induced specificity changes are not possible. Since the KL25 light chain employs the IgK J1 element, it would be of interest to investigate, whether targeted replacement of only this element with a KL25 VJ knock-in cassette would lead to a different, more polyclonal B cell repertoire in HkiL mice, which might emerge based on receptor editing. It has previously been suggested that there was a \"hole\" in the virus-specific BCR repertoire [271]. Thus far, the rarity of the virus-neutralizing specificities among na\u00efve B cells have not been manifested in such a manner, that identifies light chain mediated BCR revision as a main causative element. Despite the IgMlow, IgD+ phenotype and higher expression of Nur-77 in LCMV GP-1 binding B cells, we have not detected the activation of additional tolerance mechanisms such as anergy or deletion employed in the periphery influencing the B cell functionality Extensively studied model of self-tolerance in B cell, based on hen egg lysozyme specificity placed grounds for behavioral concepts of self-reactive B cells, with anergy being a hallmark of IgMlow B cell phenotype in the periphery [279, 280]. In the context of chronic viral infection, several HIV mouse models with the knocked-in neutralizing-autoreactive BCR specificity, such as 2F5, 4E10, lead to clonal deletion of the B cells. Only small populations of specific B cells can egress the bone marrow are shown to be functionally silenced. [130, 281, 282] However, we do not observe anergy of the IgMlow IgD+ B cells, nor functional disadvantage in the infectious settings with high and low-affinity antigens. On the contrary, upon adoptive transfer IgMlow, IgD+ B cells are more effective at viral clearance than IgMhigh B cells binding other glycoprotein epitopes. Similarly, one of the most potent HIV broadly neutralizing specificity antibody to date, isolated from an elite virus controller, does not upon knock-in lead to obvious tolerance hinders [273], although being found to be engaging with the self-antigens [70]. In addition, a possibility of a \"sweet spot\" has been described, where mild self-reactivity primes the B cells for optimal functional potential with respect to foreign antigen [110]. Together, with the possibility of B-cell \"redemtion\" [65, 66, 283] we observe a paradigm shift in the importance of self-reactive foreign antigen-specific B cells in the repertoire and self-reactive B cells having a functional spectrum. Given the dual potently neutralizing - tolerant nature of KL25 B cells, it would be of crucial importance to elucidate how the process of affinity maturation contributed to this phenotype and how this differs from the B cells carrying KL25 unmutated germline ancestor specificity, especially given our observation of largely reduced affinity and neutralizing potency of such antibodies. B cell binding for LCMV GP1 correlates directly with IgM downregulation, depicting foreign antigen affinity as a sole activator of B cell tolerance mechanisms and repertoire restriction. Consequence of this is implicit in the difficulty to elicit protective antibody immunity in HIV infection, unless tolerance mechanisms are taken into account. HkiL mouse model provides a platform to study the viral antigen immunogenicity, in the context of affinity maturation of hard-to-elicit neutralizing antibodies for pathogens evading host tolerance mechanisms. Methods Genotyping, PCR reactions Long range PCR used to confirm the correct integration of KL25 VJ gene was performed using Phusion polymerase (NEB) and primer pairs targeting the gene and region outside of the homology arms with respect to both 5 and 3 AAT AGT AGG C). The following cycling conditions were used: 98\u00b0C for 1 min; 35\u00d7 (98\u00b0C for 10 s, for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min); 72\u00b0C for 10 min. For each reaction 50ng of the genomic DNA purified using Qiagen DNA purification kit was used. PCR reaction to generate genomic DNA fragments flanking the IgL J region for gRNA testing was set up using Phusion polymerase (NEB) and specific primers (appendix table) using the following conditions: 98\u00b0C for 1 min; 35\u00d7 (98\u00b0C for 10 s, for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s); 72\u00b0C for 10 min. PCR products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and diluted to a 50 ng/ul concentration. Guide RNA identification sgRNAs were identified using CrispRGold (https://crisprgold.mdc-berlin.de/), given that they fulfill the condition of flanking the J1-J5 exons in the intronic region and are not included in the homology arms. Two such sgRNAs for each 5 crRNA31: proximity to the homology arm were chosen, synthesized (IDT) and tested in vitro for cutting efficiency (unpublished). Subsequently, crRNA52 and crRNA32 were used for the pronuclear injections. In vitro sgRNA testing for cutting efficiency Equimolar ratios of crRNA and tracrRNA (IDT) were mixed for a final concentration of 100uM and heated at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, and cooled down to room temperature. RNP complexes were created by mixing 1ul (100 pmol) of sgRNA and 1.6ul (100 pmol) of S.Pyogenes Cas9 protein (IDT) in IDT buffer. The coupling reaction was allowed to proceed for 30 min at RT. Subsequently, 400ng (8ul) of DNA substrate was added per reaction and filled up with IDT buffer to total volume of 50ul. Such Cas9 digestion reaction was incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Analogous reactions without Cas9 protein were prepared as controls. For analysis, the samples were stained using Ethidium bromide and separated through 1% agarose gel. Pronuclear injection Pronuclear injections and breeding of founder animals were performed by the Institute of Laboratory animal services center (LACS) at the university of Zurich. Further breeding was performed under specific pathogen-free (SPF) in LACS Zurich. Experiments were performed at the University of Basel in accordance with the Swiss law for animal protection and with authorizations from the Veterin\u00e4ramt Basel-Stadt and from the Veterin\u00e4ramt of the Canton of Zurich, respectively. For pronuclear injection mix, first 10 pmol of S. pyogenes Cas9 protein (IDT), 18.4 pmol of each crRNA and tracrRNA (IDT) were mixed together minutes. After that 1ug of plasmid DNA was add and the reaction was filled up to 50ul with double destiled H20. 200 fertilized oocytes were injected and after a brief incubation implanted into the pseudo pregnant foster mothers. Mice WT C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River laboratories. TgHL and Basl36 mice carry an immunoglobulin heavy chain (HC) knock-in (KI) derived from the neutralizing KL25 specificity [200] and a light chain (LC) in a form of a transgene, with and without Thy1.1 ectodomain respectively ([284], Narr K., unpublished). HkiL Rag intercrossed with a C57BL/6 on a CD45.1 congenic background to restore the RAG 2 expression (HkiL). For adoptive transfer experiment either HkiL Rag mice or HkiL Rag het mice with for HC and LC of the anti-hen egg lysozyme were generously provided by C. Goodnow [279], VI10 mice, carrying transgene K., unpublished), were used in the phenotyping experiments. TgL mice transgenic for KL25 light chain used as recipients in the transfer experiments were generated in our laboratory [30]. All mice were kept under specific-pathogen-free conditions for colony maintenance and experiments. They were bred at the Institute of Laboratory animal sciences at the University of Zurich or ETH Phenomics Center Zurich. Experiments were performed at the University of Basel, Petersplatz in accordance with the Swiss law and cantonal animal protection authorities (License BS-32652/2654 and BS-31800/2653) Recombinant protein and antibody production LCMV GP proteins for flow cytometric staining: An LCMV WE GP1 gene fragment (encoding residues 81 to 241) was cloned into the pHLsec vector for transient expression as a secreted, hexahistidine-tagged protein in HEK236T cells, according to Aricescu et al. (2006). Five days post-transfection, the expression medium was collected, supplemented with NaCl (to a final concentration of 0.75M) and Tris pH 8.0 (15mM), clarified (10,000 x g, 20 min, 4C), and brought over a 5-ml HisTrap excel column (Cytiva). Protein was eluted using a 15-750 mM imidazole gradient in 10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, and further purified by size-exclusion chromatography over a superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva) using 15 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl as running buffer. Labelling with Alexa Fluor 647 was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific). An LCMV GPC gene fragment (encoding residues 1- 431) with or without N119S mutation in mammalian expression vector, containing a CMV promoter and a Twin-Strep-tag fused to the C-terminal of the glycoprotein, was used for transient transfection of CHO cells (3mg of vector/litre of culture) at Protein Expression Core Facility, PECF, of the Swiss Federal Technical Highschool, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland. Supernatant was collected 7 days later and titrated for the use in flow cytometric staining. Flow cytometry analysis All organs were collected and cell suspensions kept on ice in B cell medium (DMEM, 10% FCS, HEPES, Sodium Pyruvate, NEAA). Spleens were pushed through a metal mesh in a Petri dish and homogenized by pipetting. Bone marrow was flushed with a syringe and needle and homogenized by pipetting. Peritoneal cavity was lavaged with 5ml medium, using syringe-needle system. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis using Zombie UV Viability kit (Biolegend). For founder identification, following antibodies were used for staining: CD3-PE, CD19-FITC, B220-PE-Cy7. Specificity staining was performed using GPC recombinant proteins. Cells were incubated at 37\u00baC for 30 minutes while shaking in 200ul GPC-StreptagII supernatant, 5ug of Fcg blocking antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) and 0.3 ug of GP1-AF647. Samples were subsequently washed and resuspended FACS and lymphocyte population was characterized from blood, spleen, bone marrow and peritoneal cavity. The following antibody panel in 50ul FACS buffer was used for the staining: 5ug incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature before washing and acquisition. For adoptive transfer experiments, spleens were collected at the final time point and homogenized. One tenth of the spleen was used for staining. Splenocytes were incubated with GPC-Streptag II protein and 5ug of Fcg blocking antibody at 37\u00b0C for 30 minutes, shaking. Afterwards washed cell suspensions were stained 50ul of FACS buffer supplemented with following antibodies: Dickinson) and data analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Absolute spelnocyte counts were performed using fluorescent labeling (CTL labeling kit) and visualization via CTL counter (CTL). Viruses and cells lines The infections and subsequent focus forming assays were performed using the recombinant LCMV strain Clone 13 virus (rCl13) expressing the WE glycoprotein (WE-GP). Alternatively, for the experiments investigating the B cell adaptation, a virus variant of rCl13 with a N119S mutation in the WE-GP (WE GP N119S) was used [44, 198]. The cell lines used for virus propagation and titration were BHK21 (ECAAC) and NIH fibroblasts, expressing BAFF and CD40L were used for B cell activation in vitro [159] Virus production, Titration and Infection The virus stocks for the experiments were propagated on BHK-21 cells (ATCC), which were infected at MOI 0.01 for two hours, after which the supernatant was replaced and collected 48 or 72h post infection. LCMV infectivity from the virus stocks or blood of infected animals was determined via Immunofocus forming assay in 96-well plate format [285]. A drop of blood was collected in 950ul of BSS supplemented with 1IE/ml Heparin (Braun). For three-fold dilutions were made and subsequently incubated with NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC) for 2 hours, before a viscous overlay (DMEM 1% methylcellulose) was applied. 48 hours later, the medium was discarded and the cell layer fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes and permeabilzed (BSS 1% Triton X-100). After blocking (PBS 5% FCS), staining for infectious foci was performed with VL4 rat-anti-LCMV-NP antibody, by a secondary HRP- cojugated goat-anti-rat IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch), each for one hour. The DAB colour reaction was applied subsequently. Experimental animals were infected with the viruses, rCl13 or rCl13*, intravenously with the high dose of Neutralizing titer measurement The neutralizing antibody titer from the serum of experimental animals was measured using immunofocus reduction neutralization test. 5ul of the serum was and 1:2 in 2% in 96-well plate. Diluted antibody containing sera were incubated with 60 PFU of rCl13/WE GP or rCl13/WE GP N119S\u00fc virus for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were added and mixture further incubated for two hours until the cells adhere. DMEM 1% Methylcelulose was added as a last step before a 48 hour incubation at 37\u00b0C. After two days a staining procedure was performed (see above) and number of foci counted using an immunospot analyzer (CTL). Neutralizing from the sera was determined from the highest dilution yielding at least 50% reduction in foci number. TgH chain sorted and genomic DNA extracted (Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue kit). Rearranged light chain immunoglobulins were amplified using multiple PCRs with forward primer binding to variable domain coding regions and reverse primer to the light chain kappa or lambda constant region. Second round of PCR included analogous primer sets extended by restriction sides allowing for later cloning of amplified fragments into expression vectors (Mouse IgG Library primer set, Progen). Briefly, the PCR reaction was carried out with 5U of Phusion HF Polymerase (NEB), 50ng of DNA template, 10uM of each primer (Microsynth) and 2.5mM dNTP (NEB), completed with ddH20 in 40ul reaction volume. The following cycling conditions were used: 98\u00b0C for 1 min; 30\u00d7 (98\u00b0C for 10 s, for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 2 min); 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Second PCR reaction was caried out analogously, using 5ul from the first reaction as a template. Purified PCR fragments (Qiagen PCR purification kit) were cloned into vectors using MluI (5`) and NotI (3`) restriction sides and resulting colonies sequenced with Sanger sequencing. Functional VJ sequences were identified using IgBlast, synthesized (Genescript) and introduced into HC and LC expression cassettes for recombinant expression in a mouse IgG2a format (provided by Dr. Shozo Izui, University of Geneva). Statistical Analysis The GraphPad Prism software version 9 (GraphPad Software) was used for all statistical analyses. For comparison of one parameter between multiple groups one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed and for comparison of multiple parameters between two or more groups two-way ANOVA was used, both followed by Turkey's post-test for multiple comparison. For statistical analysis of absolute cell counts and percentage values were log-converted to obtain a near-normal distribution. P values 0.0021 were regarded as not statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed in Figure 5. The number of experimental animals \"n\" per group, number of experimental repeats \"N\", the type of error bar displayed and the tests performed for statistical analysis are indicated in each figure legend. For titer determination in mouse serum based on standard curve fit, GEN5 software (BioTek Instruments) was used. Antibody titers were log-converted to obtain a near normal distribution.

Daniel.Pinschewer@unibas.ch One sentence summary Primary B cells engineered to express an LCMV glycoprotein-specific, neutralizing antibody clear chronic viral infection upon adoptive transfer and have a distinct differentiation pathway in vivo. Abstract Effective vaccines preventing the viral mutational escape of chronic infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remain a challenging, yet urgent medical need. A recently developed strategy proposes that primary B cells can be engineered with CRISPR/Cas9 to express broadly virus-neutralizing antibodies for prophylactic and therapeutic use against persisting viral pathogens. Here we exploited the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection model to assess the efficacy of CRISPR/Cas9-engineered primary B cells as a therapy for persistent infection and compared it to germline-edited B cells expressing the equivalent receptor. Somatically gene-edited B cells, expressing a neutralizing antibody (KL25) as receptor, transiently produced neutralizing antibody and were efficient at clearing chronic infection upon adoptive transfer into viremic hosts. However, these gene-edited cells exhibited lower B cell receptor (BCR) expression than germline-targeted KL25 B cells. The expression of the KL25-engineered cells for the viral antigen decided over their germinal center homing capacity and memory formation. Taken together, these results underscore the promising character but also persisting limitations of B cell receptor engineering-based therapies for persisting viral diseases. Introduction Passive antibody therapy has proven to be effective in multiple infectious diseases, such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Ebola, dengue, and Zika; however, it requires repeated administration over a possibly lifelong period [111]. New therapeutic approaches with continuous long-term antibody administration are based on the intramuscular expression of virus-neutralizing, antibody-encoded adenoviral vectors and have been shown to protect against a viral challenge in nonhuman primate models [103, 286-288]. Despite the potential of this method to be further translated, critical issues in vector immunogenicity or its potential selective pressure for the viral escape variants will have to be addressed. Protective vaccines modulate multiple aspects of the immune response, including B cell affinity maturation towards the immunogen, the result of which, the antibody production, is the best surrogate of protection and vaccine efficacy to date (WHO). It is of concern that, for specific pathogens, such as HIV and HCV, developing a successful vaccine remains a challenge. Investigating the underlying reasons goes hand-in-hand with understanding how these viruses manage to persist within the host and establish chronicity. A limited starting B cell repertoire of precursor specificities binding viral epitopes [289], as well as rarely successful, epitope-dependent, antibody maturation [290], are challenges that need to be overcome for a successful humoral response. While our knowledge of viral immunopathology grows constantly, genome-editing techniques have brought new possibilities of immune response modulation [291]. Clinical outcomes from treatments using ex-vivo genome-edited chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) or T cell receptor (TCR) engineered T cells show promising efficacy [292-294]. At the same time, their safety lays the ground for the development of other therapies with lymphocytes possessing engineered functions. We and others have attempted proof of concept for B cell receptor (BCR) genome editing of B lymphocytes in mice. Indeed, it has been shown that genetically engineered B cells enter germinal centers, produce antibodies and respond to immunization [156-158, 295]. Given their ability to produce neutralizing antibodies and the possibility of adaptation to viral escape variants, engineered B cells could serve not only as a prophylactic therapy, creating a new B cell pool upon autologous adoptive transfer, it also holds the potential of curing chronic viral infections altogether. We used the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model of chronic viral infection and introduced the neutralizing monoclonal antibody KL25 B cells to assess both the potential and limitations of this technology. Results CRISPR/Cas9 B cell editing optimization using a GFP reporter insert In the initial set of experiments, we evaluated optimal conditions for the culture, activation, and permissibility of primary na\u00efve B cells to the targeted genomic insertion of a foreign DNA introduced via transfection or transduction. Before editing, primary mouse B cells need to be activated. For this, we cultured splenic B cells on a CD40LB feeder layer supplemented with IL-4 [159]. B cells way exhibit a germinal center-like phenotype (GL7+, Fas+) but do not isotype switch. Green fluorescent protein (Neon) expression from the template vectors three days after the intracellular delivery served as an efficiency readout. Initially, our vectors consisted of Neon and Puromycin resistance genes, but not a promoter, to ensure the expression from the targeted locus. As a template delivery vector, baculovirus has a large cargo capacity of 100kb and can be efficiently used for primary cells' editing [296, 297]. Indeed, we observed that activated primary mouse B cells were permissive to the infection with a yellow-fluorescent protein (EYFP)-expressing baculovirus with a transduction efficiency of up to 60%. Also, difficult-to-transduce non-activated primary B cells were permissible to the infection, albeit to a lower extent (Sup. Fig. 3.1A, B). Upon transduction, however, B cells downregulated the B220 surface marker (Fig. 3.1C). When using the same transduction protocol for AAV-GFP vectors of different serotypes, we could not reach comparable efficiencies (Fig 3.1D). Due to its versatility, we eventually resorted to double-stranded DNA templates (dsDNA) as a template gene delivery method. However, further investigation of baculoviral vectors as templates for homology-directed repair (HDR) remains to be undertaken. was a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) preassembled with guide RNAs (gRNAs). designing the targeting strategy for immunoglobulin knock-in, we foresaw the importance of maintaining the BCR-engineered B cells' capacity to isotype switch, as different isotypes confer different effector functions during chronic viral infection. The strategies used for the germline antibody knock-ins, replacing the joining region (JH1-JH4) gene segments in the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH), are not feasible in the primary B cells, as one or both alleles are rearranged. Furthermore, targeting to replace a hybridoma's rearranged variable, diversity, and joining region (VDJ) gene with a green fluorescent protein (Neon) reporter template led to a significant culture lethality (Sup. Fig. 3.1E, F, G). In the alternative, non-lethal strategy, we introduced a single double-stranded break (DSB) in the intronic region downstream of the JH4. Although JH-segment replacement was not feasible as a targeting strategy, the hybridoma's lethality is a readout of gRNA's high cutting efficiency. Additionally, we induced two DSBs, removing only the last JH4 element and a part of the downstream intron (Sup. Fig. 3.1G). Homology-directed repair (HDR) with a Neon template was less efficient in the JH4 targeting strategy than in the targeting strategy using intron-specific gRNA only (Sup. Fig. 3.1H, I). Since the single-cut intron targeting, 374 base pairs (bp) downstream of JH4 element, was the most efficient and allowed for a relatively long conserved 5-prime homology arm (HA) in a DNA template, we used it as a standard strategy for our experiments. As a further step in optimization, we intended to investigate whether 20 bp microhomology arms, rather than a few hundred bp, would be sufficient for homology-directed repair (HDR) [160, 162]. Such an approach could reduce the template size and hence ease the intracellular delivery. We designed Neon-expressing double-stranded (ds) templates without a promoter (2A_Neon) with different length homology arms (Fig. 3.1A) and electroporated them together with Cas9 RNP into activated primary B cells (C57BL/6J). Three days later, the efficiency of integration was measured by the Neon expression. Transfections using the long HAs cassette favoring HDR yielded higher IgH editing efficiencies in primary B cells (Fig. 3.1B, C). To evaluate the possibility of an aberrant Neon expression, for example, from an off-target active gene, we performed a set of control transfections. We targeted the HPRT gene as a control locus to which the cassette could potentially recombine via non-homologous end-joining. We observed that the expression of Neon cassette is dependent on a correct IgH integration via HDR (Fig. 3.1D). In the case of the promoter-less cassette, 2A_Neon, the Neon gene expression depends on the strength of the endogenous VDJ promoter. Some studies elucidated the possibility of an allelic inclusion and bi-specific BCR expression [298]. Therefore, we hypothesized that adding a promoter into the Neon cassette (Fig. 3.1E) may increase the knock-in efficiency, as the number of alleles available for a repair-gene integration is doubled. Indeed, we could measure higher knock-in efficiencies and expression levels with a promoter-containing (prom_Neon) HDR cassette. Additionally, the second-in-tandem gene expression, tomato-fluorescent protein, was higher in the promoter-containing cassette. More specifically, only the Neon-high expressing B cells also expressed the tomato (Fig. 3.1F). Although the risk of off-target expression from the promoter-containing cassette was higher, we found an advantage in its increased expression of both template genes in tandem and, therefore, used it for our antibody studies. KL25 antibody expression from the IgH locus of CRISPR/Cas9-edited mouse B cells For an antibody expression from the IgH locus, we maintained the intron targeting strategy (Fig. 3.2A) and designed an LCMV glycoprotein (GP)-binding, neutralizing antibody, KL25, expression cassette, where the light chain (LC) gene, consisting of the variable, joining, and constant regions, precedes the heavy chain (HC) VDJ. A P2A self-cleaving peptide sequence between the LC and HC ensured the individual protein expression (Fig 3.2B). Both antibody cassettes with a promoter (prom_KL25) and without it (2A_KL25) were tested on primary B cells from various mouse strains differing in the number of in-germline recombined alleles available for somatic targeting. To investigate the possibility of a dual-BCR expression and allelic inclusion in genetically modified B cells, we crossed the BasL36 mouse, transgenic for KL25 antibody binding LCMV GP, and the VI10 mouse, transgenic for VI10 antibody, binding GP of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). B cells of the progeny mice had both LCMV and VSV-specific BCRs expressed on their surface in a co-dominant fashion, as measured by flow cytometry (Sup. Fig 3.2B, C). When targeting the activated primary B cells of WT mice, with one productively rearranged allele, we observed higher KL25 expression with the promoter-containing KL25 cassette (Fig. 3.2C, D). The higher expression of the prom_KL25, as opposed to the 2A_KL25 cassette, was further accentuated when another non-functionally rearranged allele was added to the pool of potential targets. This was demonstrated by the higher BCR- expression in the edited MD4 B cells (Fig 3.2E, F). Next, we utilized primary B cells of KL25HC mice, in which the KL25 VDJ gene is rearranged and knocked-in in the germline of both IgH alleles (Fig. 3.2G). These mice also express an LC transgene of the VI10 antibody to reduce the germline pool of LCMV GP-binding cells. When both targeted alleles are functionally rearranged and we further edit them with the prom_KL25 or the 2A_KL25 cassette, we obtain comparable knock-in efficiencies (Fig. 3.2H). Hence, using the promoter-containing dsDNA construct for primary B cell editing yields higher BCR knock-in efficiencies and allows for immunoglobulin expression from the allelically excluded locus. Lower LCMV glycoprotein binding of KL25 engineered B cells is independent of the targeting construct The overall engineered BCR expression, as measured by the percentage of LCMV GP-binding B cells three days after editing, was more than 3x higher in the KL25HC than in the WT mice for both prom_KL25 and 2A_KL25 constructs (Fig. 3.3A). The number of the IgH alleles available for targeting alone cannot, therefore, account for the difference. Additionally, compared to the KL25 germline knocked-in B cells - HkiL (KL25tg), the primary engineered KL25 B cells (KL25eng) have a lower binding capacity for the LCMV GP, and this is independent of the targeting cassette construct (Fig. 3B). Given the low KL25 expression of the KL25eng B cells and the decreased expression of the second-in-tandem fluorescent protein (Fig. 3.1F), we devised an experiment where engineered BCR expression is dependent solely on the second-in-tandem KL25 VDJ gene element. We used KL25 LC transgene expressing primary B cells of BasL36 mice to knock in the prom_KL25 cassette or a cassette without the LC gene (prom_KL25HC), thus making the KL25 VDJ gene the only knocked-in element (Fig. 3.3C). We observed slightly higher knock-in efficiency with the non-tandemic template; however, there was no enhanced expression of the engineered BCR for the LCMV GP (Fig. 3.3D). Hence, the in-tandem joining of the LC and HC engineered into the IgH locus does not negatively impact the antibody expression. To circumvent the necessity of the P2A linker between the KL25 LC and HC genes, which could potentially interfere with the correct folding and expression of the immunoglobulin molecule, we designed a cassette with two different HC promoters in an ambi-sense orientation - one driving the expression of the HC, the other, reversed, that of the LC (ambi_KL25) (Fig. 3.3E). We saw no KL25 BCR-engineered B cells using this cassette in the primary B cells of WT mice (Fig. 3.3F, G). The engineering of the ambi_KL25 cassette into the KL25HC primary B cells rescued the KL25 antibody expression; however, the percentage of KL25 expressing B cells decreased slightly compared to the prom_KL25 cassette (Fig 3H). Therefore, using the ambi_KL25 cassette, as suggested here, does not improve the expression of the engineered-BCR. Our findings indicate that with the expression driven by neighboring ambi-sense promoters, the forward-reading is silenced, as opposed to a functional reverse transcription of the promoter, here LC, in the IgH targeting locus. KL25 engineered cells clear chronic viral infection and enter germinal centers It has been demonstrated that KL25 transgenic B cells can clear chronic LCMV infection [226]. To compare the efficacy of the KL25 germline-knocked-in HkiL B cells (KL25tg) to the primary KL25-engineered cells (KL25eng), we transferred one million of the KL25eng cells into chronically infected animals on day six after infection (Fig. 3.4A). Taking into account our mean BCR-editing efficiencies, this number corresponds to approximately 5000 edited B-cells. Therefore 5000 KL25tg B cells were transferred in parallel. As a control, mock-engineered (NEONeng) cells were transferred. The chronic LCMV infection was cleared on day eight post-transfer in both KL25eng and KL25tg groups but not in the controls (Fig. 3.4B). The IgG titer of LCMV GP1-binding antibodies peaks on day 14 post-transfer in the KL25eng group, after which the antibody production ceases. In the KL25tg group, however, the antibody production remains constant (Fig. 3.4C). Both KL25eng and KL25tg B cells expanded in the infectious environment, while nonspecific NEONeng, B cells failed to proliferate and were not present on day 29 post-transfer (Fig. 4D, E). We observed different differentiation patterns of KL25eng and KL25tg B cells. While KL25tg cells were exclusively germinal center (B220+GL7+) phenotype on day 35 of analysis, only 40% of the KL25eng cells expressed the GL7 marker at this time point (Fig. 3.4E, F). The majority of the KL25eng transferred cells were of CD38+, GL7- phenotype (Fig. 3.4E, G). While all the germinal center KL25eng B cells were isotype switched, only 50% of the CD38+GL7- cells were, with the rest retaining an IgM+/IgD+ phenotype (Fig. 3.4H, I). Such a differentiation pathway may be reflective of the germinal center independent stimulation and memory differentiation. The B cells' entry to the germinal center during chronic viral infection has been shown to depend on the BCR affinity for the triggering antigen [6, 19]. Since the antigen-binding capacity of KL25eng cells for the LCMV GP is lower than that of KL25tg cells (Fig. 3.3B), we investigated whether the difference also accounted for the participation rate of the KL25eng B cells in the germinal center reaction. We engineered C57BL/6, MD4, KL25HC primary B cells with KL25 specificity. Before an adoptive transfer into infected animals, we measured the binding capacity of the different KL25eng cells for LCMV GP. Only the KL25HC KL25eng cells contained a high-affinity B cell population comparable in BCR expression to the transgenic, HkiL cells (Fig. 3.4J). Upon transfer into the chronically infected animals, they preferentially homed to the germinal center, while only a lower percentage (20-40%) of the KL25eng low-affinity BCR-expressing cells of MD4 and WT mice did so (Fig. 3.4K). In conclusion, KL25-engineered B cells were able to clear the chronic infection, despite their decreased ability to bind the LCMV GP when compared to germline knocked-in KL25 B cells and their binding ability decides the differentiation pathway. Discussion Genetically engineered primary B cells carrying a neutralizing antibody are the next anticipated step in the development of cell-based pharmaceuticals for the treatment of chronic viral infections. While this work has been ongoing, several comparable studies have been published, confirming that BCR-engineered B cells can expand, somatically hypermutate, and are functional when tested in the context of immunization and infection studies [156, 158]. To add to this knowledge, we confirm that B cells engineered with neutralizing specificity can suppress viremia and, therefore, functionally cure a chronic viral infection. To what extent this applies to other infections, such as HIV, remains to be elucidated. However, the cumulative knowledge of the protective capacity of the broadly neutralizing antibodies and the adaptability of the engineered cells encourages further research in the preventive, B cell pool-diversifying, and curative potential of the BCR-engineered B cells. Off-target genome modification is of significant concern when using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Combining the technological and immunological knowledge of highly specific sgRNAs and immunoglobulin locus regulation should guide the future investigation. A particular way to reduce the off-target expression that we and others show to be feasible is to use antibody templates without a promoter [157, 299]. However, we do observe a reduced protein expression of the second-in-tandem gene when the cassette is knocked in 376bp downstream of the last JH4 element. Therefore, the expression of bi-cistonic antibody cassettes may depend on the distance and/or the strength of the endogenous promoter. There is increasing evidence that engineered B cells participate in the immune response in viral infectious settings, transiently producing antibodies [157, 299]. Upon immunization, engineered B cells differentiate to form the memory compartment (B220+, CD38+, GL7-) [158, 295]. Similarly, KL25-engineered B cells enter the germinal center, mature, and form an isotype-switched memory compartment. However, we observe \"non-physiological\" differential pathways of the engineered B cells depending on the BCR antigen-binding capacity post-transfection. While germline transgenic neutralizing B cells with high affinity for the antigen primarily enter the germinal center and persist there, primary engineered B cells of the same specificity both enter the germinal center but mainly differentiate into CD38+, GL7- sub-population, within which IgM+/IgD+ B cells are present. Whether this population of cells is functional or an artifact remains to be investigated. Our comparison of the same specificity engineered and transgenic B cells suggests that for a physiologically predictable differentiation of BCR-engineered B cells, primary B cell editing techniques need to be improved towards higher BCR expression. Methods Cell lines, Primary B cell culture CD40LB fibroblasts were obtained from and first described in Nojima et al., 2011. They were passaged in DMEM 10% FCS after the initial one-week passage containing 2.5ug/ml Puromycin and 0.5mg/ml G418. PnP-mRuby hybridoma, used for the targeting optimization was cultured as recommend and kindly provided by S. Reddy [150]. Primary na\u00efve mouse B cells were of C57BL/6, TgH, TgL, MD4 and TgHxVI10 mice and purified using negative selection, EasySep mouse B cell isolation kit (StemCell). Resting as well as activated B cells were cultured in B cell medium: DMEM (Sigma) supplied with 10% FCS (Life Biosciences), 2 mM l-glutamine, 2 mM 2 mM cell activation culture 1x105 CD40LB cells were seeded in T25 flasks (TPP) and their proliferation stopped with 80Gy Gamma irradiation. Subsequently, medium was replaced with 2.5ml fresh B cell medium and 12h later 2.5ml of freshly isolated B cells (2x106/ml) were added. The co-culture was supplemented with 1 ng/ml IL-4 (BioLegend) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours. B cells were post-transfection cultured analogously, however in 12-well plate (TTP), where 5x105 of irradiated CD40LB cells in 500ul B cell medium were seeded a night prior to transfection. Post-transfection co-culture was supplied with 500ul of fresh B cell medium with IL-4 every day for 3 days. After this time, expansion to 6-well plate or T-25 flask is required. B cell RNP transfection and post-transfection culture To form an RNP one transfection, equimolar ratios, 1ul of tracrRNA (IDT) were incubated at 95\u00b0C and allowed to cool to RT. After hybridization, 2.4ul (150 pmol) of S. pyogenes Cas9 and so-prepared Cas9 RNP complex was incubated for further 30 minutes at RT. B cells in suspension were carefully aspirated without detaching the CD40LB feeder layer. 2x106 of B cells per sample were washed twice with 37\u00b0C warm PBS (Sigma). In between washings, the cells were span at 90g for 5 minutes each time. The B cells were thereafter resuspended in transfection mixture consisting of 80ul freshly prepared transfection (P4 Primary cell 4D Nucleofector X kit, Lonza), 15ul of DNA template in buffer (IDT), 4.4ul of RNP complex (IDT) and 1ul Electroporation enhancer (IDT). Electroporation was executed immediately after, using Primary B cell program of AMAXA Nucleofector (Lonza). After nucleofection, the transfection cuvettes were 500ul of B cell medium pre-warmed to 37\u00b0C, B cells aspirated and transferred onto a pre-prepared CD40LB feeder layer culture in 12-well plates (TTP) supplemented with IL-4. Based on the targeting strategy, different crRNAs were used for hybridization and RNP coupling; for intron targeting of Neon J4 + and crRNA_3HA-Ruby (CATGCCGTTGATCACCGCC) were used. dsDNA production expression cassettes with florescent proteins, prom_Neon_Tom, 2A_Neon_tom, and KL25 antibody, prom_KL25 and 2A_KL25 flanked by the XhoI and NsiI restriction sides were synthesized (Genescript) and subsequently subcloned into the vector containing Has, using the same restriction sides. (Complete maps upon request). These vectors were used as templates for PCR reaction, producing dsDNA templates. Per experiment, multiple PCR reactions were prepared. 5U of Phusion polymerase (NEB), 10uM forward primer (dsTEMP_long_fwd were completed ddH20 to 40ul following conditions: min; 35\u00d7 (98\u00b0C for 10 s, 69.9\u00b0C for 25 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min 40 s); 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Sample PCR reaction was run on 1% agar gel to ensure a single DNA fragment amplification. DNA was purified and eluted in 2 steps (Qiagen PCR purification kit) from the remaining reactions. DNA content was measured using Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher) and adjusted to 14ug in 560ul. Volume subsequently reduced to 15ul using SpeedVac DNA Concentrator (Eppendorf). Flow cytometry analysis On day 3 and 7 post-transfection, the cell cultures were dislodged and 500ul of single cell suspension filtered for staining. In adoptive transfer experiments, splenocyte cell suspension was obtained by pressing the spleens of experimental animals through the grid and homogenizing by pipetting. Splenocytes were resuspended in B cell medium (see section Cell culture) and 1 ml of the suspension was used for staining. Dead cells in both cases were excluded from the analysis using Zombie UV Viability kit (BioLegend) and samples washed with PBS. LCMV GP1 and/or GPC recombinant proteins were used to identify specific cells among cultured cells or splenocytes. Samples were incubated at 37C for 30 minutes while shaking in 200ul GPC-StreptagII supernatant, 5 ul of Fcg blocking and 1 ul (0.3 ug) of GP1-AF647. Subsequently, washed were resuspended 50ul buffer 0.2ul Streptactin-PE (IBA) and 0.5ul of B220-BV421(BioLegend) and incubated at RT for 15 minutes. Finally, samples were washed and resuspended in FACS buffer for acquisition. Adoptively transferred cells were distinguished from those of recipients` using CD45.1 and CD45.2 markers. Following staining panel 15 minutes at room temperature preceded washing step and fixation with PBS 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma). Samples were acquired with LSRFortessa flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and data analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). Viruses and transduction A recombinant virus LCMV strain Clone 13 (rCl13) expressing the WE glycoprotein (WE-GP) was used for the high dose i.v. infection (2x106 PFU/ml) in all the adoptive transfer experiments. The virus stocks were propagated on BHK-21 cells (ATCC) via a cell infection at MOI 0.01 for 2 hours, after which the medium was replaced. The supernatant was collected 48 or 72 post infection and titrated on NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC) using a standard protocol. A MultiBac baculovirus with integrated genes encoding eukaryotic yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) and tubulin were a kindly provided by M. Mansouri and P. Berger [296]. AAV vectors of different serotypes with green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the transcriptional control of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter were obtained from University of Pennsylvania Vector core facility. Primary B cell transduction was performed at the MOI of ~100 for Baculovirus and ~1x10e5 for the AAV were used. Briefly, primary B cells were isolated from the spleens of C57BL/6 mice using and negative selection B cell isolation kit (Stemcell) and resuspended in the B cell medium at a density of 5x10e4 cells/ml. 2ml of B cells were then plated on pre-prepared irradiated CD40LB feeder layer (5x10e4 cells/ml) and IL-4 in 6-well plate. 24h later, the supernatant with the B cells was collected, washed twice with PBS and resuspended in 0.5ul DMEM medium to an adjusted density of 1x10e5 cells/ml in a six well plate. Subsequently, 0.5ml of virus containing medium was added and the plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hour while shaking. Finally, 3 ml of fresh pre-warmed medium was added, and the cultures were allowed to sit at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours before washing and plating on a new CD40LB feeder layer. For spin transduction on non-activated B cells, the protocol was performed analogously, except the B cells were not plated on a CD40LB feeder layer, but were cultured in B cells medium, prior to the infection, which was performed at RT, by centrifugation at 180g for 1h. Mice As donors, CD45.1-congenic C57BL/6J have been used and obtained from the Swiss Immunological Mouse Repository, (SwImMR). C57BL/6J wild-type mice (CD45.2) used as adoptive transfer recipientswere purchased from Charles River. KL25L mice , which express the KL25 light chain were used as the recipients in the adoptive transfer experiments. KL25 heavy chain knock-in TgH [200] mice were crossed with the VI10 light chain transgenic VI10Ltg mice (unpublished) to generate KL25HC mice. B cells of this mouse strain, as opposed to TgH mice, do not bind to LCMV GP and hence the background in flow-cytometric staining was eliminated. MD4 mice, expressing anti-hen egg lysozyme HC created in tour laboratory (Narr K., unpublished) Adoptive transfers of engineered B cells Engineered donor B cells (CD45.1+) from C57BL/6, MD4 and KL25HC mice were transfected and cultured for three days prior to transfer. On day 6 of the infection, one million of the engineered B cells were transferred i.v. into recipients (CD45.2+). B cells from the HkiL donors (CD45.1) were purified using a negative selection B-cell isolation kit (Stemcell) and 5000 of such cells were transferred i.v. into the infected recipients. As a control, one experimental group was left without a cell transfer. GP1-binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay GP1-binding antibodies in using recombinant HEK293 cell- derived GP1-Fc fusion as a substrate.[33]. The Bio-One) were coated Fc antibody (Jackson) at a dilution buffer (Na2CO3 15mM, NaHCO3 35mM, pH9.6) at 4\u00b0C overnight. The plates were then blocked in a binding buffer (PBS / 0.05% Tween / 5% milk /0.2% BSA) used for every subsequent step. GP1-Fc fusion protein supernatant was diluted in binding buffer and added to the plates to be incubated at the room temperature for one hour. The plates were then washed with PBS/ 0.05% Tween (PBS-T) three times. 5 ul of the sera in binding buffer were serially diluted in the plate and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. After the triple washing with PBS-T goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP conjugate antibody (Jackson) was diluted 1:750 and added for further 1 hour incubation. After washing, HRP activity was detected using ABTS as a chromogen (Pierce). OD405 was determined in an ELISA reader (Saphire II).

General discussion Role of B cell affinity and adaptation in protecting against chronic LCMV infection In our manuscripts, we show that somatic hypermutation of antibodies is essential for high-affinity binding of the viral glycoprotein. We and others also demonstrate that upon adoptive transfer, physiologically rare virus-specific cells are sustained and compete for antigen presentation in the germinal center, given they possess a high or intermediate affinity for the viral antigen [284, 300]. The above is also true for the KL25 BCR engineered B cells. The KL25 B cells in the chronic infection setting can adapt to a lower affinity virus escape variant, highlighting the main potential therapeutic advantage of the engineered B cells over passive monoclonal antibody administration. Antibodies of KL25 unmutated antibody light chain coupled to KL25 HC, found in the rare repertoire of the GP1-binding cells within TgH mice, as well as completely germline reverted KL25, Wen 1, and Wen 3 antibodies have a marginal affinity for the LCMV glycoprotein. They are unable to protect against viral challenge. However, the KL25 neutralizing antibody is a result of affinity maturation during viral immunization challenge and is, therefore, a manifestation of the possibility to elicit high-affinity, strongly neutralizing antibody within the tolerance spectrum upon immunization, from a rare, low-affinity B cell repertoire. The potential of the LCMV infection model in studies on B cell tolerance mechanisms The concept of molecular mimicry between virus and host may have far-reaching consequences for the development of autoimmune diseases, if proven as suggested by the clinical, epidemiological, and experimental evidence from multiple infections [301]. The correlation between multiple sclerosis and EBV [302], EBV [305] as well as chronic infections of HIV, and HCV with rheumatoid arthritis [306], calls for more experimental investigations of pathogen-induced autoimmune reaction. Using the HkiL mouse model, we have demonstrated the connection between the viral specificity and immune tolerance modulation in an infectious physiological context. Presumably, our infectious setting can be used to study immune dysregulation and self-tolerance loss during chronic viral infection. The treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors in humans, monkeys, and mice enhances not only T cell mediated immune response, but also B cell mediated immunity and neutralizing antibody output, leading to a decreased viral load [307, 308], indicating a host benefit of tolerance breakdown for the immune response in chronic viral infection. However, as shown in the chronic LCMV infection, the success of the treatment with checkpoint inhibitors is dependent on the time of administration and can lead to a lethal immunopathology [309, 310]. In light of our findings, the mechanisms of tolerance breakdown and its effect on antibody formation can be investigated in the context of a monoclonal specificity. Assuming there is a self-antigen with which KL25 B cells interact, and it could be identified, dual virus and self- binding nature of these cells could favor new insights into how autoantibodies are formed in viral infection. Viral host-mimicry as a caveat for an efficient B cell response in chronic viral infection The delayed neutralizing antibody formation, completely absent at the onset of chronic viral infection and hardly inducible by vaccination, can be explained by the virus-host co-evolution and based on the hypothesis of molecular mimicry, where pathogen antigenic determinants resemble that of a host [311, 312]. The consequences are the decreased immunogenicity of the viral antigen and a very limited starting B cell precursor repertoire available for neutralizing antibody formation [270, 271]. In the model of LCMV, the glycan-shield decreases the immunogenicity of the viral glycoprotein and is deterministic for the KL25 antibody affinity [44]. Similarly, in HIV, the B12 antibody binds the N-glycosylated V-3 loop of glycoprotein 120 [313], and glycan-binding antibodies are correlated with the long-term non-progression of the viral disease [314]. Is there a link between the epitope glycan shield and the tolerant B cell state? Important implications for delayed neutralizing antibody formation can be drawn from a lower on-rate engagement with glycosylated epitopes [41, 44]. Can this be modified by differential BCR signaling or a B cell isotype? Is glycan host-mimicry, as implied by the LCMV model, the only kind that can lead to the formation of a potently neutralizing, mildly self-reactive B cell response? New infectious models with recombinant viruses with glycan-deficient glycoproteins [44] and adoptive transfers of either HkiL or KL25-engineered would be necessary for the answers. Concluding remarks B cell mediated viral clearance depends on the formation of neutralizing antibodies. It has been shown that neutralizing antibodies alone are sufficient for viral clearance, both in the macaque model of simian immunodeficiency virus [315] and mouse models of hepatitis C [316] and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [32], however, their delayed formation precludes viral control. In our studies we demonstrated how neutralization capacity in LCMV chronic infection is achieved through an efficient process of affinity maturation in the germinal centers. (Manuscript 1) However, limited starting B cell repertoire and employment of the immune tolerance mechanisms contribute to, if not cause, a delayed neutralizing antibody formation (Manuscript 2). This can be potentially therapeutically circumvented by the infusion of engineered B cells with high affinity, neutralizing BCRs. (Manuscript 3). III. References 1.

Appendix Appendix 1 Figure 1: Heavy chain knock-in, KL25H-Cki mice (A) Targeting strategy for the generation of KL25H-Cki mice. The IgH locus of C57BL/6 mice was targeted with a 5`gRNA (CGCTAAAGTTCTCGAGCCTG) and 3`gRNA (GGAGAGGCCATTCTTACCTG) (grey arrows) deleting the DQ52 element and joining regions (JH1-JH5). IgH variable regions (VH1-VHN). Prior to mouse generation, gRNAs, targeting the IgH locus in the closest proximity to the cassette`s homology arms (HA) were chosen (http://crispor.tefor.net/, https://crisprgold.mdc-berlin.de/) and tested on mouse embryos for their cutting efficiency. The most efficient gRNA pair, deleting the DQ52-JH5 segment in 2/20 pups, as confirmed by PCR was chosen. The targeting cassette was generated via DNA synthesis in pUC57 vector (Genescrit) and consists of 1.2kb 5 prime homology arm (5`HA) 173bp downstream of (prom), KL25 variable-diversity-joining 3 prime homology Both arms are identical to C57BL/6 genome (IMGT). The pronuclear injections of 234 fertilized oocytes delivered both Cas9 RNPs, including depicted gRNAs (IDT) and an enzymatically linearized plasmid targeting cassette. Zygotes were then transferred to pseudopregnatnt foster mothers, which delivered 14 pups, including 2 founders. The pronuclear injections and PCR genotyping was performed at the Centre for transgenic model (CTM) at the University of Basel.

Contributions to the work The vast majority of the experiments and analyses presented here were performed by myself. Manuscript 1 is a collaborative work of three main autors, including me, where I contributed with the neutralizing antibody and revision studies shown in the Fig. 1D, E, F; Fig. 6D, E; Sup. Fig. 1; Sup. Fig. 2A, B; Sup. Fig. 5C, D, E, F. Manuscripts 2 and 3 show only my work. Pro-nuclear injections leading to the generation of HkiL and KL25H-Cki mice were performed by the experts at the core facilities for animal transgenic models at University of Zurich or University of Basel respectively. Acknowledgements This work would not be possible without the input, help, and support of many people, who I would like to mention here. First, I thank my PhD committee members for accompanying me in this journey, namely professor Jean Pieters and professor Doron Merkler. Thank you for your patience, helpful comments, and kind encouragement. Also, many thanks to professor Hanspeter Pircher for stepping in as my external supervisor. My utmost gratitude goes to my supervisor, professor Daniel D. Pinschewer. Daniel, thank you for giving me the opportunity to join your lab and allowing me to experiment in the truest sense of the meaning, while learning about infectious immunology. I must say, your broad knowledge and complexity of thinking still amazes me, but I think I grew, and my interest in the topic is even bigger thanks to our discussions. Your support in whatever I found important and optimistic patience when things did not go well are extraordinary. I think only a great teacher can ask, \"Is there something I can help you with?\" on Friday evenings. I hope the significance of our work and other projects currently running in the lab will be well recognized. I would like to thank all the lab members, especially the early-morning faces Min, and Karen and the late-night one, Mehmet. You are more than colleagues to me by now. The work would not be such a pleasant experience without the positively charged people working in the lab. Thank you, Kerstin, Katrin, Peter, Weldy, Mirela, Anna, Tiago, for all the well-intentioned advice that helped my work. Thank you, padawans, Lena and Matias, for guarding my place. I thank my all-accepting, all-supporting parents. I know it was not easy to let your child leave for the world at such early age, but you recognized my passion and allowed me to always follow my dreams. For that, I am infinitely thankful, and I hope you can be proud. I would also like to thank my friends Satomi, Julie, Fabio, and Dany for filling my work-free time with climbing and joy. Many thanks to a special man, Christopher, whose thumbs must be hurting by now from all the pressing. Lastly, I dedicate this work to the memory of the dearest people that I lost during my PhD. My beloved grandparents who showed me the meaning of unconditional love and kindness. My best friend and a brilliant scientist, Katarina, whose curiosity and need for objective inquiry was almost infectious. Without them, I probably wouldn't be here, and I hope to carry their greatness with me until my last day. Curriculum Vitae Marianna Florova, MUDr., Dr. Med.
