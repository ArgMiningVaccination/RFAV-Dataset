Nunez Abstract | Aromatase, an enzyme located in the endoplasmic reticulum of estrogen-producing cells, catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of androgens to estrogens in many tissues. The clinical features of patients with defects in CYP19A1 , the gene encoding aromatase, have revealed a major role for this enzyme in epiphyseal plate closure, which has promoted interest in the use of inhibitors of aromatase to improve adult height. The availability of the selective aromatase inhibitors letrozole and anastrozole \u2014currently approved as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer\u2014have stimulated off-label use of aromatase inhibitors in pediatrics for the following conditions: hyperestrogenism, such as aromatase excess syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, McCune-Albright and functional follicular ovarian cysts; hyperandrogenism, for example, testotoxicosis (also and hyperplasia; pubertal gynecomastia; and short stature and/or pubertal delay in boys. Current data suggest that aromatase inhibitors are probably effective in the treatment of patients with aromatase excess syndrome or testotoxicosis, partially effective in Peutz-Jeghers and McCune- Albright syndrome, but probably ineffective in gynecomastia. Insufficient data are available in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia or functional ovarian cysts. Although aromatase inhibitors appear effective in increasing adult height of boys with short stature and/or pubertal delay, safety concerns, including vertebral deformities, a decrease in serum HDL cholesterol levels and increase of erythrocytosis, are reasons for caution. Wit, J. M. et al. Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 8, 135-147 (2012); published online 25 October 2011; doi:10.1038/nrendo.2011.1 61 Introduction Aromatase inhibitors were originally developed for the treatment of estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer,1 and these drugs have been used in clinical trials for other conditions in children and adolescents since the 1980s. However, interest has increased in the past decade owing to a potential effect of these agents on adult height. Novel insight into the use of aromatase inhibitors for this indica - tion was based on the discovery of tall (>+2 SDS) patients with defects in the genes encoding aromatase and the estrogen receptor.2-7 The potential of aromatase inhibitors to increase adult height in boys with short stature and/ or pubertal delay was further underscored by the results of four placebo-controlled clinical trials.8-11 Although it has been emphasized that their use should be considered experimental,12-18 aroma tase inhibitors are often pre - scribed off-label to short boys, although actual data on the frequency of this practice are lacking. After short introductions to the physiology of aroma - tase and chemical characteristics of aromatase inhibi - tors, this Review will focus on the efficacy and safety of aromatase inhibitors in pediatrics. The US public health grading system was used to grade the evidence and strength of recommendations.19 Although this Review is not a practice guideline, we aimed to adhere to modi - fied appraisal of guidelines research and evaluation (AGREE) criteria.20Physiology of aromatase The hemoprotein-containing aromatase enzyme is formed two proteins, cytochrome P450 19A1 (also known aromatase) and the NADPH-cytochrome reductase.14,21 The protein aromatase is encoded by the CYP19A1 gene, which is located on chromo - some 15q21.2. The entire gene spans more than 123 kb of DNA, but only the 30 -kb-long 3 '-region encodes aroma tase, whereas a large 93 -kb-long 5 '-flanking region serves as the regulatory unit of the gene. Tissue-specific expression of aromatase results from the interplay of organ- specific enhancers and promoters,22,23 which prob - ably explains the large variation in protein expression in various tissues. Aromatase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the conversion of testosterone estradiol and andro - stenedione to estrone, but are also substrates for aromatase.14 In men, most estrogen is synthesized in peripheral tissues through local aromatization of circulating andro - gens. These androgens are produced mainly by the adrenal glands,13,24 whereas the testes form only very small amounts. The principal site of aromatization is adipose tissue (stromal cells), but aromatase activity can also be found in many other tissues, such as the brain (hypo - thalamus, limbic system and cerebral cortex), breast, pla centa, liver, muscle, bone (osteoblasts and chondrocytes), testis (Leydig cells and germ cells), vasculature (smooth muscle cells) and skin (fibroblasts and hair follicles).17,25 Estro gen that is synthesized in peripheral tissues is assumed to act only locally.13,24,26Competing interests The authors declare no competing interests.

Aromatase inhibitors The effect of aromatase inhibitors on growth appears to be mediated primarily via reduced estrogen production Key points Aromatase is expressed in many tissues and converts androgens to estrogens in a tissue-specific fashion The third-generation anastrozole and letrozole suppress estrogen production by 97-99% and are highly selective Animal experiments have shown that the role of estrogen in growth regulation is different from that in humans, but have highlighted possible adverse effects of aromatase inhibitor use Contrary to theoretical expectations, aromatase inhibitors appear ineffective in the treatment of pubertal gynecomastia Evidence from controlled and uncontrolled studies in boys with short stature and/or pubertal delay suggests a positive effect of aromatase inhibitors on adult height, but more follow-up data are needed The use of aromatase inhibitors in prepubertal boys is not advised because of an association with vertebral deformitieswithin the epiphyseal chondrocytes, but a decrease of circulating estrogens also affects growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF -1) secretion.28 The current view is that, in men as well as women, estrogen does not participate in the regulation of linear growth before puberty but plays a major part in inducing the pubertal growth spurt (at low levels) and in epiphyseal maturation and closure (at high levels). Pharmacology Two types of aromatase inhibitors\u2014nonsteroidal and steroidal\u2014exist, which can be divided into three tions (Table 1).1 The first steroidal aromatase inhibitor (testolactone) was used in various pediatric studies but had disadvantages compared with newer agents, because it required a dosage of four times per day. Second- generation inhibitors (formestane, fadrozole) were soon and letrozole and the steroidal exemestane (Figure 1), which can be taken orally once daily (Table 1). A theoretical advantage of steroidal over non steroidal aromatase inhibitors is that covalent binding of the drug to the active site of the enzyme irreversibly inhib - its aromatase action.12,13 However, exemestane has not been used in pediatrics, except for one pharmacokinetic study.29 Non steroidal aromatase inhibitors form a rever - bond with enzyme.12 Anastrozole is a very selec - tive inhibitor of aromatase, in contrast to basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol syn thesis.30-32 Anastrozole is rapidly absorbed (maxi - mum after 1 h) and slowly eliminated (terminal half-life of 46.8 h) after oral dosing.33 This drug had no negative metabolic effects over a period of 10 weeks in young healthy men.34 Letrozole is also rapidly absorbed but has a longer half-life (2-4 days) and suppresses aroma - tase activity slightly more than anastrozole (Table 1),35 which is illustrated by the higher plasma testosterone and gonadotropin levels found in patients treated with letrozole compared with anastrozole.8-10 Animal experiments Knockout models for estrogen receptors, androgen receptor and aromatase have elucidated the role of sex steroids in multiple physiologic processes, includ - ing growth, but have also shown important differences between mouse and man and even between different rodent species. The effects of estrogen receptor and inactivation vary with sex and age of the mice.36 More - over, male and female aroma tase knockout (ArKO) mice appeared pheno typically normal at birth,37 but adult appendicular growth was significantly retarded in male but not in female ArKO mice.38 Both sexes displayed osteo porosis.39 Female ArKO mice had underdeveloped uteri and ovaries and were sterile due to anovulation.37,40 Male mice were fertile, but to a lesser extent than wild- type littermates.39 Increased abdominal fat deposition and insulin resistance was present in both sexes.41 Studies on the effect of gonadectomy, chemical cas - tration with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) Table 1 | Aromatase inhibitors Compound Type Suppression of estrogen production [%] First generation Aminoglutethimide (250 mg four times daily) Nonsteroidal 90.6 Testolactone (10 mg/kg four times daily) Steroidal <90.0 Fadrozole (2 mg twice daily) Nonsteroidal 92.6 Formestane (Intramuscular injection of 250 mg every 2 weeks)Steroidal 91.9 Third generation Anastrozole (1 89 (E1 64, E2 Exemestane (25 mg (E2 62||) Data derived from Geffner et al.,17 unless stated otherwise. *Data from Geisler et al.35 Data from Dixon et al.150 \u00a7Data from Publishers Limited.

In male rats, the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor vorozole decreased weight length was normal.43 Exemestane or letrozole treatment of young male rats caused osteopenia and prostatic hyperplasia and reduced body weight, tail length and IGF -1 levels.44,45 By contrast, in male mice, letrozole increased body weight and tail length gain, the width of the epiphyseal growth plates and GH levels.46 Anastrozole administration to adult male rats had no effect on the number of Sertoli cells or germ cells, or on the volume of the seminiferous epithelium, tubule lumens or interstitium.47 In female rats, exemes - tane increased weight gain and growth plate width, but less prominently than in ovariectomized rats. Trabecular bone was negatively affected, and the ovaries contained multiple cysts and were lighter than those of controls.48 Aromatase inhibitor use in pediatrics Aromatase inhibitors are approved solely for the pallia - tive or adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer;49,50 how ever, these drugs have also been used off-label for ovulation induction51 and several other conditions.52 In men with low fertility associated with a decreased testosterone:estradiol ratio, for example, in In pediatrics, aromatase inhibitors have been used off-label for the treatment of the following four groups of conditions: hyperestrogenism, hyper - androgenism, pubertal gynecomastia, and short stature and/or delayed puberty. Hyperestrogenism Aromatase excess syndrome Aromatase excess syndrome is a rare, dominantly trans - mitted syndrome caused by the transposition of a consti - tutively active cryptic promoter in front of the aromatase gene54,55 or a mutation in the promoter.56-58 The clinical picture is characterized by prepubertal or peri pubertal gynecomastia, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and compromised adult height in men, and precocious thelarche, macromastia, enlarged uterus and menstrual irregularities in women.56-58 Treatment with anastro - zole was effective and increased the initially reduced testicular volume to normal size, promoted virilization and normalized serum estrone and testosterone levels in three Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a rare, autosomal increased predisposition due to estrogen-producing large- cell-calcifying Sertoli cell tumors. In an affected 7 -year- old boy, treatment with testolactone reduced breast base diameter and bone age advance.59 In three other patients, treatment with anastrozole decreased estradiol levels, gynecomastia, growth and skeletal maturation, as well as Sertoli cell markers (inhibin A, inhibin B and anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone).60,61 McCune-Albright syndrome McCune-Albright syndrome is a rare disorder classically defined by the triad of peripheral precocious puberty, poly - ostotic fibrous dysplasia and caf\u00e9-au-lait pigmentation. These symptoms are caused by a postzygotic activating missense mutation (Cys or His to Arg201) in exon 8 of the GNAS1 gene, which encodes the -subunit of the stimu - latory G protein that regulates the coupling of hormones and receptors to adenylyl cyclase.62 This mutation results in a constitutive ligand-free activation of cellular func - tion in a mosaic distribution, leading to a high variability of organ involvement and degree of severity.63 Affected ovarian tissues form large estrogen-secreting cysts.64 Precocious puberty is the most common endocrino - logic manifestation of McCune-Albright syndrome and is more frequently diagnosed in girls than in boys. In girls, precocious puberty is caused by the estrogen-producing ovarian cysts, independent of gonadotropin action.64 Girls with McCune-Albright syndrome frequently present with sudden onset of painless vaginal bleeding due to with - drawal of estrogen's effect from the resolving ovarian cyst, as early as the first year of life.65 Breast development can be slow or develop rapidly. Although prolonged intervals of quiescence occur between vaginal bleeding episodes, some girls with McCune-Albright syndrome experience progression of precocious puberty with frequent men - strual bleeding, associated development of other secon - dary sexual characteristics, acceleration of linear growth and advancement of skeletal maturation leading to early closure of the epiphyseal growth plates and compromised adult height.65 Treatment with testolactone initially appeared benefi - cial,66 resulting in a decrease in estradiol level, mean ovarian volume and cessation of menses, as well as a decreased rate of bone maturation, in three girls who were menstruating regularly. However, the response to O OO O NN N Figure 1 | Chemical structure of currently available aromatase inhibitors. REVIEWS \u00a9 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved138 | MARCH 2012 | VOLUME 8 www.nature.com/nrendotreatment beyond 6 months was mixed, indicating pro - gressive decline in efficacy or escape from therapeutic effects after 2-4 years and/or poor compliance.67 Also, the effect of fadrozole on mean serum levels of estrone and estradiol, ovarian volume, frequency of menses or rates of bone age advance was disappointing in a study of 16 girls.68 Fadrozole caused a dose-dependent inhibition of cortisol and aldosterone biosynthesis, which returned to normal following its discontinuation, except in one patient.68 Letrozole was used in an open-label therapeutic trial comprising nine girls with precocious puberty as part of the McCune-Albright syndrome.69 Response to treat ment after the initial 6 months and after long-term treatment up to 36 months showed partial efficacy; mean serum estradiol and ovarian volume fell markedly in the first 6 months, but increased toward or above the pretreat - ment level by 24 months due to recurrence or increase in size of the ovarian cysts in some girls. Skeletal matura - tion and growth velocity were significantly decreased at 36 months. Cessation of menses was incomplete in three of the nine girls, but the frequency of bleeding decreased. The other six girls had complete cessation of menses in the 12-36 months of letrozole therapy. Adverse effects included an increased ovarian volume and cyst enlarge - ment, and one girl experienced ovarian torsion.69 By con - trast, anastrozole treatment over 1 year was ineffective in achieving the therapeutic targets.70 The limited efficacy of aromatase inhibitors in patients with McCune-Albright syndrome is probably owing to the inherent heterogeneity in the tissues involved in this syndrome and due to the underlying genetic abnor - mality, that is, the resulting constitutive activating effect of the genetic mutation might be too aggressive to be counteract ed by these medications. Functional follicular ovarian cysts Increased estrogen secretion from ovarian cysts can cause peripheral precocious puberty. These cysts are usually self-limiting and resolve spontaneously; however, in some cases these cysts can persist, and, rarely, surgical inter - vention is required. Anastrozole has been reported to be successful in treating a girl who presented with unilateral enlargement of the ovary and a recurrent autonomous ovarian cyst, without adverse effects.71 Hyperandrogenism Testotoxicosis Testotoxicosis, also known as familial male-limited precocious puberty, is caused by an activating muta - tion in the luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor, which is associated with increased testosterone production from early childhood onwards, independent of gonadotropin regulation. This increase leads to early pubertal develop - ment, advanced skeletal maturation and early closure of the epiphyseal growth plates, thus resulting in short adult height.72 Testolactone combined with spironolactone decreased growth velocity and skeletal maturation over 6 months,73 but no change occurred in the predicted adult height (PAH).74 However, in a follow-up report in 10 boys treated with testolactone for at least 6 years, who received the GnRH analogue deslorelin following onset of central precocious puberty, growth rate normalized within 1 year and remained normal during the next 5 years of treat - ment. The rate of bone maturation normalized during the second year of treatment and remained normal thereafter. PAH increased by 13 cm after 6 years of therapy.75 Later studies using the potent antiandrogen bicaluta - mide and anastrozole or letrozole in four boys had a clear effect on growth velocity and skeletal maturation and preserved or increased PAH,18,76,77 as did the combina - tion of anastrozole and cyproterone acetate.78 The results of a phase II study on the combination of anastrozole and bicalutamide ( n = 14) showed that, after 1 year, the mean height velocity decreased by 1.6 cm per year, the mean bone age or chronological age ratio decreased from 2.1 to 1.0, and aggressive behavior was reduced by 50%.79 Gynecomastia, breast tenderness and central preco - cious puberty the most common treatment-related adverse events.79 Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Long-term studies on growth in children with the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency, who are treated with corti - costeroids and mineralocorticoids, have shown that average adult height is decreased, presumably caused by a combination of androgen excess (undertreatment) and corticosteroid excess (overtreatment).80-82 In an effort to improve these results, a combination of testolactone, the antiandrogen flutamide, fludrocortisone and a low dose of hydrocortisone was compared with standard treat - ment with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. A trend toward increased PAH was observed but did not reach statistical significance.83 In 2004, patients in the experi - mental group were switched to letrozole,14 but no results have been reported to date. Other causes of hyperandrogenism Theoretically, aromatase inhibitors could be useful in conditions treated by the use of high doses of androgens, as these drugs prevent the consequences of androgen to estrogen conversion. One possible example is the treat - ment of men with hypogonadism caused by the partial androgen insensitivity syndrome. In theory, the combi - nation of high-dose testosterone in combination with an aromatase inhibitor might give better results than treat - ment with testosterone alone,84 but no reports on this approach exist thus far. Pubertal gynecomastia Gynecomastia is a frequent phenomenon in boys during puberty and is thought to result from an imbalance of the stimulatory effects of estrogen relative to the inhibi - tory effects of androgen in breast tissue.14,85,86 In most boys, this imbalance resolves spontaneously, although it persists for more than 2 years in 25% of boys.14,87 In an open-label study of 42 boys with gyneco mastia (mean age 13.0 years), treatment with anastrozole for REVIEWS \u00a9 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reservedNATURE REVIEWS | ENDOCRINOLOGY VOLUME 8 | MARCH 2012 | 1396 months reduced breast area and volume by 63% and 57%, respectively.33 However, in the only randomized, placebo-controlled study,88 anastrozole treatment of 80 boys with gynecomastia (mean age 14.6 years) for at least 6 months had no effect on the percentage of boys achieving >50% reduction in breast volume (38.5% ver sus 31.4% for anastrozole and placebo, respectively), although a clear effect was seen on the serum testosterone:estradiol ratio. The difference in apparent efficacy between the uncontrolled and controlled study could be due to the difference in mean age\u2014in boys with early gyneco mastia, the breast development would have largely resolved without treatment. A retrospective uncontrolled study has suggested that an estrogen receptor modifier (tamo - xi fen or raloxifene) might be more efficacious than aromatase inhibitors.89 Short stature and/or delayed puberty Based on the observations of unfused epiphyseal growth plates in adult men with tall stature due to a disruptive mutation in the aromatase3-7 or estrogen receptor gene,2 it was postulated that blocking endogenous estrogen syn - thesis (or bioactivity) might result in retardation of bone maturation, thereby prolonging the time for growth and increasing adult height.12-18,90,91 A GnRH analogue alone has minimal efficacy for this indication92 but can increase adult height by 5 cm in combination with GH,93,94 albeit at the expense of a decreased BMD.94,95 A retrospective study on seven pubertal boys with the estrogen recep - tor antagonist tamoxifen suggested that this agent might delay skeletal maturation and increase PAH,96 but no controlled studies have been performed. Randomized controlled trials Three trials have been performed in boys with various combinations of short stature and delayed puberty (Table 2), and one study was done in GH -deficient boys.8-11 In a Finnish study, 23 boys with delayed puberty (mean age 15.1 years) were randomly allocated to two treat - ment groups: 1 year of letrozole (2.5 mg once daily) or placebo. Both groups also received testosterone injec - tions for 6 months and were evaluated 18 months after initiation of therapy.8 A third, nonrandomized group received no treatment. PAH increased significantly more in letrozole-treated boys than in placebo-treated boys (5.1 cm versus 0.3 cm), owing to a significant reduction in bone maturation with letrozole treatment (Table 2). The nonrandomized, untreated controls gained approxi - mately 2 cm. Serum levels were testosterone, LH, follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) and were increased. In a follow-up study,97 near-adult height of the letrozole-treated group was 6.9 cm more than the placebo group and only 1.3 cm lower than target height, a mean increment of 0.6 SDS. In placebo-treated boys, near-adult height was 4.8 cm below target height, con - sistent with previous reports on sponta neous growth (or growth after low-dose testosterone therapy).98-103 Some additional observations can be made from this study. First, almost all participants had entered into puberty at the start of the study, were not extremely short and had a PAH in the normal range, so most clini - cians would offer reassurance or a short course of andro - gens, with a generally good outcome. Further more, the results might have been affected by selection bias at the start of treatment (boys receiving letrozole tended to be taller, have a higher PAH and taller parents than placebo-treated controls) and in the final analysis (the difference between the groups with respect to PAH at the start of treatment was larger in the 17 patients followed until near-adult height than in the 22 patients initially included). Moreover, the results obtained with a com - bination treatment (letrozole plus testosterone) cannot automatically be extrapolated to letrozole alone, and no adult height data were reported for the untreated boys. Finally, the real adult height might be considerably higher than the near-adult height, as the range of bone ages at Table 2 | Letrozole vs placebo in boys with short stature and/or delayed puberty Characteristics Wickman et al.8,97* Hero et al.9,104Salehpour et al.11 Population (at baseline) Diagnosis Delayed puberty ISS CDGP Treatment Letrozole vs placebo (+ 6 months testosterone)Letrozole vs placeboLetrozole vs placebo Duration (months) 12 24 24 n 10 vs 10 16 vs 14 31 vs 30 Age 15.1 11.0 13.5 Bone age 13.1 vs 12.6 9.1 vs 8.9 12.1 vs 11.7 Height (cm) 155.3 vs 151.9 128.5 vs 127.5 NA Height -2.4 176.5 vs 175.3 vs -0.3 vs -0.8 -1.8 vs -2.0 NA Evaluation Time after start (months)18 24 24 Growth velocity (cm per yr) 7.6 vs 7.9 5.3 vs 5.2 NA Height SDS change NA NA +0.5 vs 0.0 bone age 0.9 vs 1.7 per 1.5 years1.2 vs 2.1 per 2 years1.1 vs 0.5 per 2 years PAH (cm) 182.1 vs 175.2 172.9 vs 166.9 173.7 vs 173.3 PAH (cm) 5.1 vs 0.3 5.9 vs 1.1 6.1 vs 1.4 Follow-up Age (years) 19.9 vs 18.2 16.9 vs 17.3 NA Bone age (years) 16.9 vs 16.7 15.8 vs 16.6 NA Height (cm) 175.8 vs 169.1 159.1 vs 161.1 NA PAH (cm) NA 166.5 vs 162.4 NA *Besides the two randomized groups, 10 patients did not wish to undergo medical intervention (untreated controls).

REVIEWS \u00a9 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved140 | MARCH 2012 | VOLUME 8 www.nature.com/nrendofollow-up was quite wide (15.8-18.0 years). The results of this study might, therefore, have been overstated. In a second Finnish study, 30 boys with idiopathic short stature (ISS) aged 9.0-14.5 years were randomly allocated to receive either letrozole or placebo for 2 years (Table 2).9 Most of them (81% and 93%, respectively) were prepubertal at the start, and 44% remained pre - pubertal after 2 years. Their height at the start was either <-2 SDS or >2 SD below target height, and bone age was <14 years. Letrozole-treated boys showed similar height velocities to those receiving placebo, but bone age advanced less with letrozole therapy. Given that letro - zole delayed bone maturation similarly in prepubertal and pubertal boys, regardless of bone age, the investiga - tors concluded that estrogen already plays a part in the maturation process of the growth plate before puberty. Height SDS for bone age improved by 0.7 SD, whereas no change occurred in the placebo group, and the PAH increased by 5.9 cm.9 However, at follow-up 6 years after the start of the study, the difference in PAH between the letrozole-treated and placebo-treated group was not statistically significant (166.5 cm versus 162.4 cm).104 A critical comment on this study is that most participants were prepubertal, a patient group to whom most clini - cians would be reluctant to give aromatase inhibitors owing to the frequency of vertebral deformities in this population (see below).104 Furthermore, no near-adult height data are available yet. In the third study, from Iran, 91 boys with constitu - tional delay of growth and puberty were randomly allo - cated to three treatment groups: letrozole, placebo or oxandrolone for 2 years (Table 2).11 Letrozole increased PAH more than placebo; however, remarkably, letrozole appeared to increase height velocity (difference in height SDS +0.5 versus 0), and bone age advance (1.1 year per 2 years versus 0.5 year per 2 years) was surprisingly slow in both groups. Clarification of these issues and follow-up data until adult height is reached are awaited. The efficacy of anastrozole co-treatment with GH in GH-deficient males has been investigated in two studies from the USA.4,105 An open-label pilot study on 20 patients treated for 1 year did not show an effect on PAH.105 In a later study, 52 male adolescents with GH deficiency were randomly allocated to co-treatment with anastro - zole (1 mg) or placebo for 1-3 years.10 Inclusion criteria were GH deficiency and GH treatment (0.3 mg/kg per week) for at least 6 months before the start of the study. Moreover, the study participants had to be pubertal and have a residual height potential. PAH increased in the anastrozole-treated group (+1.3 cm, +4.5 cm and +6.7 cm after 1, 2 and 3 years, respectively), whereas only 1 cm of PAH gain was observed in the placebo group.10 The decrease in growth velocity during the course of the study was greater in the placebo group than in the anastrozole group at 36 months.10,91 No adult height data are available to date. Retrospective studies In a retrospective study in 24 male adolescents with various endocrine conditions who exhibited short stature and low PAH (mean age 14.0 years), letrozole treatment for a mean duration of 1 year led to an increase of PAH of 5.5 cm, independent of co-treatment with androgens or GH.12,32 Two other retrospective studies in boys with delayed puberty also reported an increased PAH.106,107 Although bone age progression appeared to decrease in one retrospective study on the effect of aromatase inhibi - tors (in combination with a GnRH analogue) in girls with a relatively low PAH and rapidly progressing bone age,12 we believe that aromatase inhibition for growth enhance - ment in girls with ISS is contraindicated, in view of potential adverse effects such as virilization due to hyper - androgenism and the development of ovarian cysts. Safety concerns Estrogen receptors and aromatase activity are ubiquitously present throughout the body, illustrating that estrogen signaling is crucial. Potential safety concerns of inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis can be deduced from findings in patients with aromatase deficiency,4,5,7,108-112 patients with estrogen deficiency or hyper testosteronemia, and from animal studies.18,44,45,48,113 However, lifelong estrogen deficiency, such as in patients with aromatase deficiency, as well as postnatal exposure to aromatase inhibitors in animal models\u2014equivalent to treating from infancy through puberty\u2014do not translate to the same level of exposure achieved in humans thus far. In this section, we shall only discuss safety concerns in men treated with aromatase inhibitors. Hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal axis In early and midpubertal boys, estrogen is the primary sex steroid responsible for the central negative feedback effect on gonadotropin secretion.9,114 After the onset of central puberty, blockade of estrogen biosynthesis by letrozole increases the circulating levels nocturnal LH pulse amplitude, not influence nocturnal LH pulse frequency.9,114 As a result of increased secretion of LH, gonadal testo - sterone production is stimulated. Mean serum testosterone concentration at Tanner stage IV (genital stage) reached supraphysiological levels of 30.9 nmol/l and slightly over 50.0 nmol/l during letrozole treatment in boys with ISS and delayed puberty, respectively,8,9 a value approximately three times higher than that in controls. This increase may enhance the progression of physical signs of puberty.9 Treatment with anastrozole results in less stimulated androgen secretion,10 presumably owing to the lower potency of this agent compared with letrozole.115 Whether aromatase inhibitor therapy influences the timing and progression of puberty is unclear. In a study in young prepubertal boys, aromatase inhibitor treatment did not influence circulating sex steroid concentrations or basal gonadotropin levels, nor the onset of puberty.9 In boys with constitutional delay of growth and puberty, a greater proportion of letrozole-treated individuals entered puberty compared with placebo-treated boys.11 No reports on severe androgenic adverse effects, such as facial acne, have been published.11 Theoretically, aromatase inhibitors might have an effect on prostatic REVIEWS \u00a9 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Hypertestosteronemia might cause erythro - cytosis,15,116 which has indeed been observed in puber - tal boys treated with aromatase inhibitors18 and in men with aromatase deficiency.111 In boys treated with letro - zole and in hemoglobin levels corre lated with levels.117 Erythrocytosis can increase the risk of thrombotic events.18 To our knowl - edge, the influence of hypertestosteronemia on behavior has not been systematically studied. Another theoretical risk of hypertestosteronemia is a decline in adiponectin. However, serum adiponectin levels declined similarly in letrozole-treated boys with ISS and untreated controls, although a trend towards lower values was observed in letrozole-treated boys.118 Treatment of adolescent boys with letrozole,8,9,11 but not with anastrozole,10 enhanced testicular growth, most probably due to elevated gonado - tropin levels. Circulating inhibin B increased in letrozole- treated pubertal boys in a similar manner9 or even more8 than in placebo-treated boys. Findings in knockout animal models have suggested that some level of estrogen receptor activation and aromatase activity is required for normal spermato genesis,13,119-121 and letrozole treatment of monkeys resulted in reduced sperm count and quality.122 In humans, estrogens pro - duced locally in sperm can influence its fertilizing capac - ity.123 However, no differences in sperm parameters were found between GH -deficient boys who received anastro - zole several years earlier and controls.124 In fact, aromatase inhibitors have been employed to increase FSH secretion in the treatment of male infertility.53,125 Bone health Sex hormones have an important role in bone develop - ment and remodeling, particularly in puberty, with a distinct sexual dimorphism.126 As indicated by the bone phenotype of men with aromatase deficiency or estro - gen resistance, long-term deprivation of estrogen action results in low bone mass.2,4,5,7 Furthermore, aromatase inhibitors in women have been shown to increase bone turnover and fracture risk.127 This finding has raised con - cerns that aromatase inhibitor therapy during childhood or adolescence could adversely influence the accrual of peak bone mass and increase the risk of osteoporosis. BMD BMD has been monitored in four controlled trials using aromatase inhibitors in adolescent boys.8-11 During treat - ment with letrozole for 1-2 years in boys with delayed puberty8,11 or ISS,9,128 areal BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck increased in a similar fashion to placebo, as evaluated by dual-energy X -ray absorptio metry (DXA). Similarly, in a study of GH -deficient boys, 3 years of anastrozole treatment in combination with GH had no adverse influence on areal BMD.10 Letrozole treatment also had no adverse effect on bone mineral apparent density, a measure of volumetric BMD.8,9,11 Furthermore, short-term treatment of adolescent males with anastro - zole did not influence kinetically measured rates of bone calcium turnover.34These observations suggest that aromatase inhibi - tor treatment for 1-3 years in male adolescents has no adverse influence on bone mass accrual. This neutral effect on BMD is potentially explained by bone-protective effects of stimulated androgen secretion, which stimu - lates periosteal bone formation and bone expansion.128-130 However, DXA is a 2D measurement technique and gives no data on bone quality in different bone compartments or on bone geometrical properties. Considering that peripubertal aromatase inhibitor treatment of male rats impairs bone geometry and trabe - cular bone quality,44,45 more data are needed on the effect of aroma tase inhibitors on trabecular bone density and structure in adolescent boys. In addition, the relation - ship between development of muscle mass and bone mass during aroma tase inhibitor therapy has not yet been characterized. Bone turnover Longitudinal follow-up data of serum and urine markers of bone turnover have been reported in two studies on letrozole treatment in adolescent boys.128,131 In the placebo groups, the levels of bone turnover markers increased during follow-up and, as expected, correlated positively with growth velocity. In letrozole-receiving boys, the levels of some markers of bone resorption and formation remained at the pretreatment level, suggesting lower bone turnover rate. In contrast with the placebo group, the changes in markers of bone turnover corre - lated poorly with changes in circulating estradiol, testo - sterone or IGF -1, or with growth velocity.128 As boys with delayed puberty or ISS had elevated levels of circulating testo sterone after the onset of puberty, the lower rate of bone turnover might reflect androgen-induced inhibition of bone resorption.132,133 The effect of this finding on bone strength is unclear. Cortical bone Letrozole treatment in boys with ISS resulted in enhanced cortical bone growth, as evaluated by the metacarpal index.128 The change in metacarpal index correlated positively with mean testosterone:estradiol ratio during treatment, supporting the view that androgens increase and estrogens decrease periosteal bone formation.129,130 Cortical bone size is an important predictor of bone strength,134 and the metacarpal index associates negatively with the risk of wrist and forearm fractures in children, even after adjusting for DXA-measured BMD.135 Findings in a 17-year-old boy with aromatase deficiency and sufficient testosterone level suggest a more com plex regulation of cortical bone growth by sex steroids. In this boy, estrogen treatment increased bone cross-sectional area and cortical thickness, but not volumetric BMD.136 Indeed, a certain level of signaling through the estrogen receptor in bone tissue might be required for the androgen-induced cortical bone anabolic aromatase inhibitor treatment have been associated with impaired trabecular bone REVIEWS \u00a9 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved142 | MARCH 2012 | VOLUME 8 www.nature.com/nrendodevelopment in male mice,38,43,44 and low bone mass with severe kyphoscoliosis was evident in a 27-year-old man with aromatase deficiency.7 These findings raise the concern that aromatase inhibitor treatment during adoles cence might impair the strength of vertebral bodies rich in trabecular bone. Post-treatment vertebral body morphology has been evaluated by MRI in two cohorts of men who had received letrozole.104 In men with ISS, letrozole treatment for 2 years during prepuberty or early puberty was associated with a significantly increased risk of vertebral body deformities compared with placebo, with five of 11 letrozole-treated men showing mild anterior wedging or compression deformities. These mild deformities probably reflect disturbed vertebral body growth rather than true compression fractures. By contrast, in men with delayed puberty treated for 1 year during early or midpuberty, letrozole had no effect on vertebral morphology.104 Body proportions and composition From observations in aromatase-deficient men, one would expect therapy with aromatase inhibitors to decrease trunk length and increase leg length. In a follow- up study on boys with delayed puberty and ISS, this phe - nomenon was indeed observed, although the differences between groups were not statistically significant.104 Therapy with aromatase inhibitors has no effect on BMI.10,118 In a study of boys with GH deficiency, no dif - ference in fat free mass or percentage fat mass (as evalu - ated by skin fold measurements) between anastrozole and placebo groups was found during 3 years of treatment.10 By contrast, letrozole decreased the percentage of fat mass after the start of puberty in boys with ISS.118 The difference between letrozole and anastrozole in fat mass response might be explained by GH co-treatment in the anastro - zole study and/or by the higher androgen levels induced by letrozole than by anastrozole, because the change in testo - sterone correlated negatively with the change of percentage fat mass in letrozole-treated boys.118 Metabolic parameters Letrozole treatment effectively blocked the pubertal increase in both circulating estradiol and IGF -1 in two studies,8,9 but this finding was not confirmed in the Iranian study.11 This relatively low IGF -1 level probably reflects a lack of pubertal stimulation of GH secretion, which is known to be estrogen-mediated.138 This suppression of the GH-IGF -1 axis was also observed in healthy male adoles - cents treated with anastrozole,34 but not in boys with GH deficiency,10 presumably owing to the co- administration of GH. LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels were not affected by aroma tase inhibitor treatment in male adolescents.10,11,118,139 By contrast, during progres - sion of puberty, letrozole reduced HDL cholesterol levels (particularly the HDL2 cholesterol subclass) by approxi - mately 0.5 mmol/l,118,139 due to increased HDL cho lesterol catabolism.140,141 A similar decrease was noted in apolipo - protein A-I levels. The change in HDL cholesterol con - centration was negatively associated with the change in testosterone levels and positively associated with the change in adiponectin levels.118 After discontinuation of treatment, HDL cholesterol levels were similar in the letrozole-treated and control groups. This reduction in HDL cholesterol levels has not been observed in puber - tal boys treated with anastrozole, which is potentially explained by GH co-treatment and/or lower testo sterone levels in these indivi lipoprotein(a) decreased in pubertal boys treated an inverse relationship to serum testosterone.118,139 Aromatase inhibition during male puberty results in a hormonal milieu characterized by normal to high testo - sterone concentration, low estradiol concentration and low IGF -1 concentration. The net effect of these changes on insulin sensitivity appears to be neutral10,34,118 or benefi - cial,139 as evaluated by levels of fasting serum insulin, glucose or homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index. Fasting insulin concentrations of adolescent boys decreased during treatment with letrozole and increased in boys receiving placebo; the changes in fasting serum insulin and IGF -1 levels correlated positively, suggesting that aromatase inhibitor treatment attenuates the develop - ment of insulin resistance of puberty by preventing the activation of the GH-IGF -1 axis.139,142 Adiponectin levels declined similarly in letrozole-treated and placebo-treated pubertal boys.118 Cognitive function Several lines of evidence suggest that estrogen has a role in the regulation of cognitive functions.143 Temporal lobe neurons are capable of synthesizing estrogen locally through aromatization of androgenic precursors, and estrogen receptor is expressed abundantly in the hippo campus of the human brain,144 an area known to be important for memory function. Estrogen might have a role in the regulation of verbal memory performance, also in adult men, whereas direct androgen effects are possibly more important for spatial memory.145 Given that aromatase inhibitors cross the blood-brain barrier,146 aromatase inhibitor treatment might theoreti - cally result in disturbance of cognitive function. How ever, this observation was not documented in studies includ - ing adult women and men.147,148 Also, in adolescents, no effect of letrozole on cognitive performance was found, as evaluated by a selection of cognitive tests focusing on verbal and visuospatial performance and memory.149 How ever, the number of patients was small and only a few boys reached late stages of puberty in that study, making further investigation of this issue necessary. Safety parameters during follow-up If a clinician decides to prescribe aromatase inhibitors off-label to pediatric patients, we propose to follow up several efficacy and safety parameters (Box 1). The primary concern is still the treatment's influence on bone health, so we recommend performing BMD measure - ments and evaluation of vertebral morphology every year. Suggestions to assess vitamin D status have been made, and at least standard doses of calcium and vitamin D sup - plementation are recommended in patients treated with aromatase inhibitors.18 At present, we do not recommend REVIEWS \u00a9 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reservedNATURE REVIEWS | ENDOCRINOLOGY VOLUME 8 | MARCH 2012 | 143using aromatase inhibitors in children or adolescents with a known primary or secondary disease that affects bone health. Hemoglobin and hematocrit are to be checked, in view of the risk of erythrocytosis. In girls with McCune-Albright syndrome, whether or not aromatase inhibitors are used, it is necessary to follow up basal and stimulated gonadotropin levels to recognize the onset of central puberty. When pubertal onset occurs, a GnRH analogue should be added, to avoid exces - sive stimulation of the ovaries.69 Furthermore, regular sonography of the uterus and ovaries is mandatory. Design of future studies The use of aromatase inhibitors in childhood and adoles - cence is off-label and, therefore, by definition experimen - tal. For clarification of its potential role and benefit-risk ratio in increasing adult stature, studies are needed to directly compare letrozole, anastrozole, GH, GH plus an aromatase inhibitor, and placebo in boys with short stature in an early stage of puberty. Outcome parameters should include predicted and achieved adult height and extensive safety parameters, including thorough assess - ment of vertebral abnormalities. Although, admittedly, no study comparing various ages at treatment start and durations of treatment exists, we believe that, in future studies, aromatase inhibitors could be administered to boys in an early stage of puberty (Tanner stage 2-3) for a duration of 2-3 years. Conclusions For the practicing clinician the answers to two questions are important: first, which are the medical conditions in which off-label use of aromatase inhibitors can be con - sidered in pediatrics, given current data on efficacy and safety; and second, which aromatase inhibitor should be used preferen tially? The answers to the first question are summarized in Table 3. We believe that sufficient argu - ments are in favor of the use of aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of aromatase excess syndrome and for an aromatase inhibitor plus antiandrogen to treat patients with testotoxicosis, in spite of the low number of cases reported. Aromatase inhibitors can be considered in the management of patients with Peutz-Jeghers syn - drome or McCune-Albright syndrome, but the results are sub optimal and variable. Data to support the use of aroma tase inhibitors in congenital adrenal hyper plasia and girls with functional follicular ovarian cysts are insufficient. Aroma tase inhibitors appear ineffective in pubertal gynecomastia. For the treatment of boys with short stature and/or delayed puberty, considerable evidence indicates that aromatase inhibitors effectively delay bone maturation and thereby increase PAH.8-11,97 When compared with GnRH analogues, advantages of aromatase inhibitors include that pubertal development and growth spurt are less affected, which is expected to have positive effects on psychosocial wellbeing. Furthermore, bone mass accrual as well as body composition appear to be less affected by aromatase inhibitors than by GnRH ana - logues. However, near-adult height was only reported in one study, and studies differed widely in trial design, diagnosis, age, pubertal stage, height, preparations, dura - tion and co-treatment with other compounds (GH or testo sterone). Certainly, safety concerns remain, par - ticularly an increased risk of vertebral deformities in Box 1 | Follow-up of aromatase inhibitor therapy Medical history and physical examination Signs of androgen excess (for example, acne) Height, weight, sitting height Pubertal staging, testicular growth Musculoskeletal symptoms (joint and back LDL cholesterol Hemoglobin, hematocrit Blood leukocytes Vitamin D Radiological assessment Bone age BMD and bone mineral apparent density of the lumbar spine and femur Peripheral quantitative CT (pqCT) Vertebral morphology by radiography (lateral projection) Suggested co-treatment Calcium and vitamin D supplementation Table 3 | Off-label use of aromatase inhibitors Conditions according to efficacy of off-label aromatase inhibitors usen* Quality of evidence Probably effective Aromatase excess syndrome 3 IIIB Testotoxicosis (if combined with bicalutamide)20 IIB Probably effective, but safety concerns Short stature and/or delayed puberty 83 IB Probably partially effective Peutz-Jeghers syndrome 3 IIIB McCune-Albright syndrome 37 IIB Probably ineffective 82 Congenital of patients treated with third-generation aromatase inhibitors.

We, therefore, believe that aromatase inhibitors must be considered experimental in all growth disorders, and their use should ideally be limited to well-controlled studies. If a clinician still con - siders aromatase inhibitor treatment in an individual case, thorough monitor ing of possible adverse effects, particularly vertebral deformities, is mandatory. With respect to the comparison between letrozole and anastrozole, the difference in potency would suggest that in boys with testotoxicosis and in girls with McCune- Albright syndrome, letrozole might be more effective than anastrozole. In boys with short stature, a less severe blockade of aromatase may have advantages, for example, less elevated serum testo sterone levels and possibly a milder effect on vertebral bone health. Review criteria The following databases were searched: PubMed (1946 to March 2011), EMBASE (OVID-version, 1980 to March 2011), Web of Science (1945 to March 2011) and COCHRANE Library (1898 to March 2011). For the three concepts, all relevant keyword variations were used, not only in the controlled vocabularies of the various databases, but the free text word variations of these concepts as well. This search strategy was optimized for all consulted databases, taking into account the differences of the various controlled vocabularies as well as the differences of database-specific technical variations (for example, the use of quotation marks).
