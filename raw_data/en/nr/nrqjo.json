Some people may start \"picking\" at their skin, experience things like hearing voices or seeing things that are not really there and become paranoid. Taking crystal meth repeatedly over a long period time can result in longer lasting health effects which may or may not be permanent such as: - weight loss - non-healing ulcers and sores - brittle fingernails - tooth grinding - chronic chest infections - liver disease - hypertensive disorders (define) - depression - psychosis If you are sharing drug using equipment such as stems or bowl pipes with others, you can become infected with the viruses that cause HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. A person who is experiencing an overdose on crystal meth may experience some or all of the following; - red face - sweating heavily - fever - very rapid or irregular heartbeat - rapid breathing and/or eye movement - shaking or trembling (jerky body movements) - hallucinations - seizure - aggression, anxiety, extreme paranoia - stroke or heart attack [Tips for Preventing Crystal Meth Overdoses](http://librarypdf.catie.ca/PDF/ATI-20000s/26545.pdf) - Stay with the person if it is safe to do so. - Call 911; - If the person is having seizures. - Not breathing or swallow breathing. - Is a risk to themselves or others. - Encourage rest until help arrives. - Apply cool clothes to back of their neck or forehead to help them cool down. - If they are not breathing or have no pulse start CPR. - If they are having a seizure; clear the space, place them into the recovery position, support their head and make sure their airway is clear.
