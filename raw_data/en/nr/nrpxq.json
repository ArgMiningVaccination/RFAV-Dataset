Panch means \"five\" and Karma means \"procedure\". It is a unique treatment in the sense that includes preventive, curative, and promotive actions for different diseases. The goal of Panchakarma is not only to eliminate toxins from the body but also to maintain a balance between the mind, body, and spirit. The five procedures of Panchakarma are Vamana (Emesis), three steps followed during Panchakarma treatments: - Poorva Karma: It is the preparatory stage that is done before the main procedure to enable a person to receive full benefits of the Panchakarma treatment. It consists of two main processes: Oleation (Snehanam) and fomentation (Swedanam). This procedure helps to dislodge the accumulated toxins from the body and thus preparing the body for complete removal of toxins. - Pradhan Karma: It is the main procedure done after the completion of Poorva Karma in which toxins are eliminated from the body. - Paschaat Karma: It is a post-therapy procedure that includes a dietary regimen to restore the body's absorptive and digestive capacity into its normal state. Dietary modification: Each dosha requires a specific diet. An individual as per their body constitution is supposed to avoid foods that are believed as a trigger for toxin buildup in the body. Ayurveda recommends water as a primary beverage during detox. It recommends mono-diet along with the diet to be taken at the same time each day to rebalance the dosha. Massage: An ayurvedic massage during detoxification moves impurities in the body towards the digestive system and thus it helps to flush out toxins from the body.
