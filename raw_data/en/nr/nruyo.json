From the beginning, the support of faith leaders has ensured that all Chicagoans have access to lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines. Chicago Day of Prayer Saturday, November 5, 2022 No matter where you live, or how you worship - prayer is universal. Many faith communities across the city on Saturday, November 5 gathered to give their holiday season a BOOST in a shared moment of prayer for COVID-safe celebrations. COVID-19 is still here, and being up-to-date on vaccines offer the best protection from severe outcomes. This includes updated vaccines/bivalent boosters designed to protect against the Omicron variants currently circulating. Last year, on November 6, nearly eight thousand Chicagoans across all denominations in all of Chicago's 77 neighborhoods paused for a shared moment of prayer for COVID-safe holidays - in churches, on street corners, at local police stations alongside officers, and more. More than 150 places of worship took part in Day of Prayer activities, praying for healing and comfort for families who have suffered illness, loss, and pain over the past 20 months, and for safety in the City of Chicago.
