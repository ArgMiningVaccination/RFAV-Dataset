Claude Hemphill III, MD, Chief The highlights of the report are as follows: 1. Mission and Scope of the Clinical Service a. Missions Clinical Mission - To provide the highest quality neurology specialty and selected subspecialty services for patients of ZSFG and SFHN within the context of a complementary academic agenda Research Mission - To support and encourage clinical and translational research complementing the clinical mission, focusing on the following: (1) Acute Care - stroke, TBI, brain injury after cardiac arrest, seizures ; (2)HIV neurology ; and (3) Global Health , Equity Teaching Mission - To support UCSF teaching and training of students and post -doctoral trainees in neurology b. Clinical Scope Inpatient Services - Personnel for all these services includ e attending physician s, residents, and medical students. Servi ces for General Consultation and Neurocritical Care also have interns. o General Ward Service - inpatients with primary neurological problems (not in ICU); major teaching focus for residents and students o General Consultation Service - inpatients with consult ation requests from a primary service, majority of which are from Emergency Department; consult services especially consult residents are first point of contact with Neurology for emergency such as \"Code Stroke\"; calls from SFHN providers outside ZSFG; key rotation for resident development o Neurocritical Care Service - patients in ICU or Neurology Service; co -manage patients in ICU or Neurosurgery Service; consult/co -manage patients in ICU with critical neurological problems on cardiology/MICU services (post -arrest) and trauma surgery; attending and fellow coverage for Acute Stroke Activations Outpatient Services o General Neurology Clinics - venue at 4M; big clinics operating at 3 half days/ week with 2 half days for new patients ( 25 patients ) and 1 half day for follow -up (60 patients); staff includes attendings, residents, NPs, students o Sub-Specialty Clinics (biweekly) o Issues New Patient Clinic -High no -show rate causing difficulty for providers to have individual panel of patients -Data currently unavailable for provider accountability related to number of patients seen and duration of visits Follow -up Clinic - primarily due to physical plant issues -No rooms for attending follow -up clinics or separate subspecialty clinics -Only 2 -3 attendings for 50 -70 resident patients Neurodiagnostic Laboratory Services o EEG (includes continuous monitoring) - This program has significantly expanded for the part 6 - 8 years with its shift from outpatient to inpatient service. Strong collaboration with nursing Problem with te chnician staffing even with reasonable number of machines for outpatient and inpatient EEG; goal is to have 7 -day coverage for patient safety EEG machines due for upgrading o EMG - 1 EMG machine, 1 EMG room, 2 MD s pg. 2 2. Faculty and Residents a. Trainees in Clinical Programs Neurology Residents (UCSF) with assigned ZSFG 'Chief' - 4 daytime residents and 1 night resident Outside service interns and residents - 3 from Neurosurgery UCSF, 2 from Internal Medicine UCSF, and 6 fro m St. Mary's Med Neurocritical Care Fellows - 2 each month ; currently non -ACGME (will probably be ACGME latest 2025); key to ZSFG Stroke Program coverage Medical Students - 4 3rd year students, sub interns and electives, 1st year UCSF students b. Attending and Staff ZSFG -Based - There are 8 full -time staff based at ZSFG and around 20 staff who work clinically at ZSFG who are based in other UCSF campuses. Faculty members and administrators were acknowledged for their expertise, experience, and coll aborative efforts. Other Attending Staff o UCSF (Parnassus & Mission Bay) - There is reliance on collaboration across various parts of UCSF Neurology Department due to strong relationship with parent department. o Community Volunteers - Before, about 40% of inpatient/outpatient service was covered by volunteers. Currently, there are none; they have either retired or moved on. o Geriatric Cognitive Disorders Clinic at ZSFG - There is a collaboration between the UCSF Memory and Aging Center and ZSFG Geriatrics , DGIM (Division of General Internal Medicine) . c. Faculty - All faculty members are involved in local and national service. The following were noted: Dr. Eddy Amorim - Writing Committee Member, American Hospital Association (AHA) Post - Cardiac Arrest 2025 Guidelines Dr. Alexandra Brown - Associate Residency Director, UCSF Department of Neurology Dr. Felicia Chow - local and national involvement in Neuro-Infectious Diseases Dr. Claude Hemphill - administrative and research roles in local and international gr oups Dr. Nicole Rosendale - involvement in diversity and equity aspect at UCSF, ZSFG, LGBTQ+ (national), and others Dr. Vineeta Singh - Vice -Chair, Neurocritical Care Test Committee; 2022 Master Clinician Award (1st awardee chosen from 130 clinicians) , UCSF Department of Neurology 3. Performance Improvement Activities a. General - faculty meeting (monthly), morning report (each weekday), professor rounds (twice monthly) b. Projects Joint Commission Primary Stroke Center metrics o tPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator) for Acute Ischemic Stroke: DTN (Door -to-Needle) rate by year - Complianc e with national metrics dropped significantly during the COVID -19 pandemic (2020) which was a common finding. At ZSFG, the decline was partially due to families not accompanying family members into ED; there were challenges in finding out when strokes started especially in patients who were non -native English speakers. Neurology Service exerted extensive efforts to improve DTN rate as manifested in increased rates since 2021. o Count of Embolectomies (from ED) - There has been strong collaboration not only bet ween Neuro -IR and Neurology but also between ED and Anesthesia. Embolectomy is done less than 1 a week for stroke. This procedure has really become routine in care of stroke patients. Resident Duty Hour supervision - Significant improvement work has been accomplished . o Major priority of overall Neurology Department - There was an R RC citation. The Neurology Service has been much concerned about PR regarding house staff morale and resident recruitment. o Currently no duty hours violation at ZSFG campus - The ci tation issue was lifted. pg. 3 o Corrective Measures - The citation was lifted due to \"zero tolerance\" policy instituted by the Department Chair to solve the problem. There were neither additional inpatient resident staffing nor additional NP staffing . Inpatient residents are given extra weekday off every 2 weeks. Twice weekly running total report of individual resident duty hours is generated. If at risk, residents are sent home, and attending physicians cover service themselves. Resident rotation length reduced from a month to at times as short as a week. o Current State - There are no duty hour violations . However, there has been additional work (sans additional pay) for attendings which is occasionally last-minute/unanticipated, and there has been les s continuity of inpatient care. The attending physicians, nurses, and neurocritical care fellows have voiced complaints. Lastly, it has been difficul t to fully staff all inpatient rotations (attending preference for Consu lt over Ward Service). o Long -Term So lution - Neurology Service is working with Residency Program and Dean's Office on a long -term solution . Faculty Compensation - parity with UCSF Health SURF CPG \"Cardiac Arrest resuscitation care exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic and opioid crisis\" - There is a disproportionately large percentage of cardiac arrest patients due to drug overdoses. c. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion - The Neurology Service aimed to see itself as the \"Equity Division\" within the overall department. There are indivi dual activities emphasizing women leaders, URM (Underrepresented member) in research , national and local diversity, and resident curriculum. Furthermore, the new program BALANCE (GloBAL Neurology, Neuroinfe Ctious Diseases, and Health Equity) is being dev eloped and led by Drs. Felicia Chow and Nicole Rosendale within the Department of Neurology (across all various campuses). The BALANCE Journal Club and BALANCE Faculty Panel Series were started in the past year. Additionally, there has been collaboration w ith residents to create a \"resident section\" , along with application for 2 NIH training grants. 4. Research - Many research projects with NIH funding were presented. Awards recei ved by faculty members were recognized. 5. Financ ial Report a. Income/Expenses - The Department transitioned from volunteers to full -time faculty. There were efforts to increase faculty compensation. A higher percentage of revenues arise from Affiliation Agreement. b. Billable Clinical Activity - This has leveled off over the last 2 years after a huge increase that was disproportionately high in comparison with increase at ZSFG. Without changes, the current volume could be used as a model for future appropriate staffing. 6. Summary a. Assets - These include mission -driven junior and rising faculty ; strong ties with UCSF Department of Neurology ; collaboration across multiple S ervices ; grant support ; collaboration with ZSFG ; quality of UCSF Neurology residen cy & fellowships ; and reputation of programs . b. Challenges - These include change in resident workforce and expectations; EEG staffing; outpatient clinic infrastructure; and absence of Inpatient and Emergency Child Neurology consultation. c. Goals - These include planning and implementing better delivery model; adequate staffing of neurodiagnostic (specifically EEG) program; re -engineering outpatient Neurology service; continued capitalization on strong relationships while keeping mission -driven faculty who are also involved in scholarly activi ties; enhancement of philanthropy; and maintenance of morale with move to new Research and Academic Building. The various efforts by the Neurology Service certainly exemplify the aspects of True North Goals.

NEUROLOGY SERVICE ORGANIZATON The Neurology Service is an academic component of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). The Service also, therefore, conforms to the UCSF regulations and policies and to the policies of the UCSF Department of Neurology. These affect particu larly: staff appointments; resident training; policies and allocations; medical student teaching programs; research programs; and financial oversight. There are no perceived conflicts between the UCSF policies and the policies of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital , but if a conflict should arise that relates to patient care activities, the ZSFG Medical Staff Bylaws and Rules and Regulations of ZSFG and this document will take precedence. The Neurology Service conforms to the Medical Staff Bylaws and Rules and Regulations of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital (ZSFG ). This document is therefore supplementary, defining some of the specific rules and regulations that pertain to the Neur ology Service and its activities. The Rules and Regulations of the Neurology Service define certain principles, standards of practice and other rules of the organization of the Neurology Service and the duties of its members. A. SCOPE OF SERVICE The mis sion of the Neurology Service follows the traditional tripartite goals of an academic medical center: Patient Care, Education, and Research. However, in the immediate setting of patient care and patient interactions (inpatient services, outpatient clinics , telephone contact or consultation, etc.) the Neurology Service patient care mission takes precedence whenever there is a conflict or discrepancy among the three mission components. The policies and approaches to clinical service are outlined more specif ically in greater detail in a separate document, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Neurology Service: Description of Service (Appendix B).

Organization of the Neurology Clinical Service The activities of the Neurology Clinical Service are divided into the following: a) Inpatient Adult Neurology Ward Service b) Inpatient Adult Neurology Consultation Service c) Inpatient Neurocritical Care Service d) Outpatient Adult Neurology Clinics e) Neurodiagnostic Laboratories f) Child Neurology Service Each of the above activities, including their organization, goals and schedules, are described in greater detail in the supplementary docume nt, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Service: Description of Service , (Appendix B ), and are briefly outlined below. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 7 Inpatient Adult Neurology Ward Service The Inpatient Adult Neurology Ward Service provides hospital care for adult patie nts with neurological diseases and their complications. The purpose of this Service is to provide optimal diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients for whom neurological disease or dysfunction is the predominating reason for hospitalization and the need for acute medical care. This embodies both specialized (care of the neurological condition, itself) and principal (medical care of associated conditions related to the neurological disease, when appropriate) care to this group of patients. Inpatient Adult Neurology Consultation Service The Adult Neurology Consultation Service provides specialized consultation to inpatients hospitalized under the care of other services and to emergency department or outpatients requiring urgent consultation in order to assist in providing optimal care of these patients . Inpatient Neurocritical Care Service The Inpatient Neurocritical Care Service provide s primary hospital care and consultation for patients with acute and subacute neurological problems requiring critical care services. This includes management of acute stroke and is coordinated with the activities of the ZSFG Joint Commission certified Prim ary Stroke Center. Outpatient Adult Neurology Clinics The Outpatient Adult Neurology Clinics provide specialized neurological evaluation, management and consultation for patients suffering neurological dysfunction. It is the outpatient venue for both neurological consultation (advice to other physicians providing care) and principal neurological care (continuous direct care provided by the Clinic neurologist where appropriate). Neurodiagnostic Laboratories The Neurodiagnostic Laboratories cu rrently have t wo components: the Electroencephalography (EEG) Laboratory (which includes Evoked Potentials) and the Electromyography (EMG) Laboratory. Each laboratory provides diagnostic services for both inpatients and outpatients. Child Neurology Servi ce The Child Neurology Service provides neurological services for pediatric patients and is organized together with the Pediatrics Service and provides specialized neurological consultation for selected inpatients and outpatients in the pediatric age group (0-18 years).

TEMPORARY PRIVILEGES Temporary Privileges sha ll be authorized in accordance with the ZSFG Bylaws and the Rules and Regulations. IV. PROCTORING AND MONITORING A. REQUIREMENTS Monitoring (Proctoring) of individual neurologists shall be the responsibility of the Chief of the Neurology Service (or designee) and the Director of Performance Improvement and Patient Safety (PIPS) for the Neurology Service and is based on observation a nd review of the care of five patients for each privilege (see Appendix A). V. EDUCATION The Chief of the Neurology Service is responsible for Education and Research and is accountable to the Vice Dean and the UCSF Department Chair for the conduct of graduate and undergraduate medical education and UCSF based research programs conducted throug h the Neurology Service. The Neurology Service is an important teaching site for the UCSF Neurology Residency Training Program (See Section VI). Surgery Interns destined for the UCSF Neurosurgery Residency Training Program and St. Mary's Internal Medicin e Residents serve one -month rotations on the service intermittently through the year. The Service is also a major teaching site for the UCSF School of Medicine, including Brain, Mind, and Behavior apprenticeships (15 -20 MS1s per year) and Neurology 110, t he Core Neurology Clerkship (45 MS3s per year). Additionally, 2 -4 UCSF and extern MS4s complete Neurology 140, the Consultation Elective in Neurology, at ZSFG yearly. VI. NEUROLOGY SERVICE HOUSESTAFF TRAINING PROGRAM AND SUPERVISION The Training of Neuro logy Residents from UCSF is a major commitment of the Neurology Service. Part of this training involves graduated responsibility as the residents advance in their training. The role and responsibility of house staff at each level of training and their su pervision, along with a description of the supervision of medical students is delineated in detail in the document , Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Neurology Service: Description of Service (Appendix B). The Neurology Service is intended to be a \"Resident -Directed Service\" so that whenever appropriate the senior resident on the service will function as the principal coordinator and director of patient triage, evaluation and discharge. Since responsibility is 'graduated' according to the experience , ability and capability of individual house staff, it will be the responsibility of the Attending Physician to judge these qualities and act accordingly; the Chief of Service and other Attending Physicians will assist in this judgment according to their c ollective experience and the experience within the UCSF Neurology Residency program. Housestaff independently enter all orders, but all DNR orders must be cosigned by an Attending Physician within 24 hours and discharge orders can only be signed by a licen sed physician. The Attending Neurologist in each of the clinical venues is responsible for maintaining the highest quality of patient care, and assumes ultimate responsibility for patient management. This includes assuring that resident -directed activiti es, and indeed intern and medical student activities, adhere to the highest ethical and professional standards and that they compromise neither patient care nor patient amenities. The supervising Attending Neurologist must appropriately step to the foregr ound when needed, either for direct patient care or to assure patient understanding and Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 10 communication, but also step back when the residents are able to assume this responsibility and perform these duties at the highest level according to their level of tr aining ability and experience. The capacity to adjust in this way, depending upon both the residents' abilities and the patients' needs, will be taken into account when evaluating Neurology Service faculty performance. Attending Neurologist coverage is a vailable 24 hours a day either in -person or by telephone. Residents are expected to communicate in a timely fashion with the responsible Attending Neurologist in the following circumstances: 1) Patients being considered for admission or transfer to the Neuro critical Care Service. 2) Patients being considered for cooling after cardiac arrest. 3) Patients who die on the Neuro critical Care or Neurology Ward Service without a DNR order. 4) Children seen for neurologic consultation . Resident evaluation is coordinated through the evaluation process centralized in the Department of Neurology at UCSF. This involves a web -based evaluation system with each Attending Physician filling out a performance assessment at the end of the residents ' monthly rotation. This evaluation is discussed with the resident and also the aggregate assessments are reviewed and contribute to the overall performance evaluation of each resident. These are used by the Residency Director and the individual resident's faculty advisor as a basis for assessment of performance and advice regarding improvement. Resident performances are also discussed among Attendings at monthly faculty meetings . Feedback for individual errors or management issues is also discussed at the time of their occurrence by the Attending Physician and by the Chief of Service (or their designee) at Morning Report. All deaths on the Neurology Service are reviewed monthly by the PIPS Director and quarterly by the PIPS Committee, with attention to impl ications for resident and Attending management issues. Transfers from the Neurology Service are tracked by the Committee quarterly. VII. NEUROLOGY SERVICE CONSULTATION CRITERIA Refer to IX.G. below: Attending Physician Responsibilities. VIII. NEUROLOGY SERVICE DISCIPLINARY ACTION The Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations will govern all disciplinary action involving members of the ZSFG Neurology Service. IX. PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT/PATIENT SAFETY (PIPS) AND UTILIZATION MANAGEMENT The Neurology Service is committed to the maintenance of the highest standards of practice and dedicated to the continued efforts to improve Neurology Service performance. The PIPS effort is embedded in the day -to-day activities of the Service a nd in structured activities, including Morning Report, Attending Rounds, Professor's Rounds and the PIPS Committee. The Chief of Service, or designee (e.g. Director of PIPS), is responsible for ensuring solutions to quality care issues. As necessary, assistance is invited from other departments, the Performance Improvement/Patient Safety Committee, or the appropriate administrative committee or organization . The goals and objectives of the Neurology Service PIPS Program include, but are not limited to: 1) To ensure appropriate care and safety of all patients receiving care in the Neurology Service. It is understood that this care is provided chiefly in the 4M Clinic and acute medical -surgical areas (wards, ICU s, Emergency Department); 2) To minimize morbidity and mortality, as well as to avoid unnecessary days of inpatient care. Efficiency in delivery of service remains a prime objective. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 11 The Neurology Clinical Service PIPS Program is delineated in the document, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Neurology Service PIPS Plan.

Medical Records shall include complete documentation of patient's clinical information, diagnosis, and current status and management plan in the chart. The details of the formats and responsibilities of each member of the clinical \" team\" with respect to this documentation are outlined in a separate document, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Neurology Service: Description of Service (Appendix B). F. INFORMED CONSENT All decisions for treatment (or withdrawal of treatment) sho uld involve the active participation of the patient or his/her surrogate, and should be made after appropriate discussion of the risks, benefits, and alternatives. G. ATTENDING PHYSICIAN RESPONSIBILITIES The responsibilities of each member of the clinical n eurology \"team\" a re delineated in detai l in the document, Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital Neurology Service: Description of Service (Appendix B). The Attending Neurologists assigned to the individual components of the Neurology Clinical Service have the ultimate responsibility for patient management. In brief: Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 12 1) The Attending Neurologist assigned to the Adult Inpatient Ward Neurology Service will assume overall responsibility for the care of patients admitted to that Service. This entail s: - Direct evaluation of these patients, initially within the first 24 hours of their admission, and throughout their hospital stay. - Supervision of all aspects of their care, including major decisions in management and close supervision of the resident staf f. - Documentation of this participation in the form of daily notes in the medical record (weekend cross -coverage may be shared with the Attending Neurologists assigned to the Neurology Consultation Service) - Availability by pager or telephone 24 hours per da y. 2) The Attending Neurologist assigned to the Adult Inpatient Consultation Neurology Service will assume overall responsibility for inpatient consultations. These include: - Direct evaluation of inpatients within 24 hours of the request for consultation usually following initial evaluation by the consultant resident. - Review of all neurology consultations evaluated by the neurology resident in the Emergency Department not resulting in admission (and hence not covered by the above consideration or not assumed by the Inpatient Service Ward or Neurocritical Care Attending). This may be performed at the time of evaluation or retrospectively, the following day, depending upon the complexity and acuity of the problem. This may also take place at Mor ning Report, with the faculty member staffing Morning Report serving as the designee of the Neurology Consultation Service Attending for purposes of case review. - Assure that the advice of the Neurology Service is accurate, appropriate, and well founded, an d that this is communicated in a clear and timely manner. - Availability by pager or telephone 24 hours per day. 3) The Attending Neurologist assigned to the Neurocritical Care Service will assume overall responsibility for the care of patients admitted to tha t Service. This entails: - Direct evaluation of these patients, initially within the first 24 hours of their admission, and throughout their hospital stay. - Supervision of all aspects of their care, including major decisions in management and close supervisi on of the resident staff. - Documentation of this participation in the form of daily notes in the medical record . Daily attending documentation notes may also be completed by the Neurocritical Care Fellow assigned to the service if that fellow holds a facult y Clin ical Instructor title and is in a non -ACGME position - Assure that the advice of the Neurology Service is accurate, appropriate, and well founded, and that this is communicated in a clear and timely manner. - Supervise any neurocritical care procedures p erformed, depending on the level of experience, training, and expertise of the fellow or resident performing the procedure - Availability by pager or telephone 24 hours per day. 4) The Attending Neurologist assigned to the Child Neurology Service will assume t he overall responsibility of all neurology consultations involving patients in the pediatric age group in conjunction with the Child Neurology Fellow based at Benioff UCSF Children's Hospital . This includes: - Staffing of Child Neurology Outpatient Clinic o n the ZSFG campus - Direct evaluation of inpatients as deemed appropriate by the requesting service and if available and on campus . Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 13 - The adult Neurocritical Care Service Attending may participate in the care of children with critical neurological emergencies admitted to ZSFG (e.g. neurotrauma) - The adult Neurology Consult Service may staff inpatient consults for children ages 17 years and older - Other neurological consultations will be directed from the ZSFG Pediatrics Service to the Chi ld Neurology Fellow on call for UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital 5) The Attending Neurologists assigned to supervision of the Neurology Clinic will assume ultimate responsibility for the patients evaluated and cared for in the Neurology Clinic. The degree of direct supervision of outpatient evaluation will depend upon the: - Training level , individual experience, and proven ability of the resident staff also caring for the patient, as well as - The complexity and difficulty of the patient problem. - This w ill range from complete and thorough evaluation by the Attending in cases where students are first evaluating patients to a brief review of the findings and plan in the case of advanced residents. - The Attending Neurologists in the Clinic will also serve to assure the efficient and timely triag e and evaluation of patients and the highest standards and courtesy and professionalism in the clinic. 6) The Attending Neurologist assigned to either perform and interpret EMG's or interpret EEG's and Evoked Potential s will have received appropriate subspecialty training (Board Eligibility or Certification) and will assure that these are performed in a timely manner commensurate with optimal clinical care and that interpretations are made and conveyed to the referring physician in useful form , usually within one to two (1 to 2) days of their performance, depending upon the reason for the test. If privileged to do so, an attending neuromuscular neurologist may also perform botulinum toxin injections in patients for whom this is indicated. X.

It serves as a supplement to the document, Rules and Regulations, Neurology Service, Zuckerberg San F rancisco General Hospital . The Neurology Service at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital is divided into several principal components that contribute to fulfilling its clinical mission. These include the Adult Inpatient Neurology Ward Service, Adult Inpatient Neurology Consultation Service , Neurocritical Care Service, and Neurology Outpatient Clinics . The service also oversees the Neurodiagnostic Laboratories , electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG) laboratories (in combin ation with the Hospital) and cooperates with the Pediatric Service in providing Child Neurology Service specialty care. These are complementary components that contribute to the continuity of patient care and the continuity and breadth of education, as wel l as provide a platform for clinical research. These activities are driven by a strong commitment to the overall service mission of Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and by the association with and commitment to the University of California, San Francisco and particularly its Department of Neurology. The Neurology Service believes that specialized neurological care is an essential component of the patient care services at ZSFG . Likewise, the Neurology Service at ZSFG is an important component of the UCSF Neurology Department and both enhances the academic activities of the Department and benefits from the programs, leadership and resources of the 'parent' Department. This document focuses on the clinical services and emphasizes the organization an d hierarchical responsibilities of physician members of 'team' in relation to the component activities. It also explains the weekly schedules for the three inpatient services that are included at the end of this document. Mission of the Neurology Service The mission of the Service follows the traditional tripartite goals of an Academic Medical Center: patient care, education and research. Patient Care. This is the principal focus of day -to-day activity of the Service and the component of our mis sion that underlies the Service's very existence. The Service's objective is to provide exemplary patient care and clinical service to the patient community served by ZSFG within the limits of available resources. This is the first priority of all activiti es related to patients. The Service aims to provide timely, knowledgeable and humane service to all individuals within the framework of the institution. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 2 Education. ZSFG is a major postgraduate and medical student teaching venue in the UCSF system. The maj or educational emphasis of the Service, and one that lies at its very core, relates to the UCSF Neurology Residency Training Program. The Neurology Resident rotations at ZSFG are among the most important of the three years of this specialty training. This importance is based on the nature and traditions of this Institution and to the patient populations served. In turn, the Resident Trainees provide critical service to the Hos pital and to these patients. The supervision of residents is aimed at allowing graduated responsibility based both upon the years of training and upon the individual capabilities of the trainee, while at the same time providing the safeguards of appropriat e Attending Staff supervision. This training is effected principally through experience and instruction at the bedside and organized formally through the various inpatient teaching and work rounds and individual review of patients in the outpatient setting . Medical student teaching, particularly at the third year level, is also an important activity that receives major attention of the Service. Customarily 4 -5 students rotate monthly on the Service as part of their mandatory neurology clerkship. They rotate among the inpatient Ward, Consultation, and Neurocritical Care services . Fourth year students may also elect rotation on the Inpatient Consultation and Neurocritical Care Service s. Teaching of students involves bedside rounds as well as group didactic s essions centering on 'case vignettes; designed to broaden their familiarity with the full spectrum of neurological disease. Research. The ZSFG Neurology Service considers the development of Clinical and Translational Research directed at elucidating and ameliorating the diseases afflicting the patients cared for at ZSFG to be critically important and a central aspect of its mission. There is a direct connection with the UCSF Brain and Spinal Injury Center at ZSFG . There are now ongoing clinical research s tudies in HIV -AIDS, stroke, and traumatic brain injury . Without vigorous and strong commitment to each of the three components of the mission, the Neurology Service would lose its identity and raison d'etre , at least in its current form. Each of these co mponents contributes directly (e g. shared personnel and resources) and indirectly (e.g. quality of personnel and intellectual rigor) to the strength of the other. None can be sacrificed or compromised without important impact on the other. The following section describes each component of the Clinical Service. Inpatient Adult Neurology Ward Service The Inpatient Neurology Ward Service provides specialized care for patients with neurological Diseases and their complications. Its purpose is to admit and care for patients in which the need for neurological diagnosis and treatment is preeminent and for those who have received principal care from the Service when they develop other complica tions requiring hospitalization . The physician and physicia n-in-training personnel centrally contributing to the Service include: the General Inpatient Ward Attending Neurologist, the Senior neurology Resident, the Junior Neurology Resident, PGY1(s) when present, and the third -year Medical Students spending their required Neurology Clerkship on the Service. Other personnel are also Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 3 critical to the operation of the Service, including particularly the Neuroimaging unit of the Department of Radiology, the nurses on the various units, the Social Worker assigned to the Service, and the Neurorehabilitation 'team' from Physical, Occupational and Speech Therapy; these components will not be discussed further here, however, except as they relate to the schedule and expectations of the Service. The following describes some of the expectations and responsibilities of each of the aforementioned physician and physician -in-training team members. Ward Service Attending Neurologist - The general Ward Service Attending Neurologist is ultimately responsible for care of patients on th e Service except for those housed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This involves both supervisory and direct patient evaluation and management. With respect to the latter, the following rules should be followed, with rare exceptions: S/he will directly e valuate and provide an admission note on all new patients within 24 hours of admission and earlier if indicated by the type or complexity of the illness. S/he will directly evaluate and provide a progress note on all patients daily . This will generally be done in the context of daily Attending Work Rounds made with the Neurology Resident s. Weekend cross -coverage may be shared with the Inpatient Neurology Consult Attending. S/he will oversee the entire staff but generally confer with and communicate with the Senior Resident in directing the Service. S/he will directly participate in all decisions regarding invasive diagnostic studies, therapy and life support. Since the Serv ice is committed to functioning as a 'Resident -Run' service, the Attendi ng Physician needs to make judg ments and adjustments with respect to when s/he needs to assume the primary physician role and when s/he can delegate this role to the resident staff. Th is will depend on the individual capabilities of the resident and on the complexity and nature of the patients' illnesses. At all times the Attending must be sufficiently familiar with the details of the patients' management to assure that optimal care is being administered. The latter includes not only the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriateness of therapies, but also the manner and thoroughness of communication with families and other personnel involved in the patients' overall care. The Attending must set and assure the standard with respect to professionalism and highest ethical and personal interactions. The Ward attending physician also plays an overall role in coordinating the educational experience of the MS3 students rotating on the various ZSFG neurology services. Case vignettes (standardized and provided by the Department of Neurology medical clerkship director) should be discussed with the entire group of rotating MS3 students at least once each week . Ward Service Senior Neurology Resident - This resident directly manages the Ward Service and serves as the overall \"Practice Group Leader\" for all the Neurology residents rotating at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 4 ZSFG at a given time. This resident importantly oversees the details of day -to-day decisions regarding triage and admission, as well as diagnosis and therapy. S/he rounds daily with the Attending Neurologist on Ward Attending Work Rounds and participates in Resident Work Rounds. S/he directs patient -related decisions in consultation with the Attending Physicians as needed. S/he also plays a major role in teach Medical Students the fundamental aspects of neurology, including the neurological examination and basic care of those with neurological impairment. The formal duties thus include: Directly supervising care o f all patients on the Ward Service. This requires direct evaluation of each patient and ongoing monitoring of all diagnostic studies, therapy and patient status. Overseeing the quality and timeliness of chart documentation by the Junior Resident and adding a formulation, clarification summary note on complex admissions or during the course of a complex course of illness. Assuring the timely completion of discharge notes, including sharing this duty with the Junior Resident. Reporting to, consulting with, an d rounding with the Attending Neurologists daily. Assisting and filling in for the Junior Resident during the daytime when they are absent or too busy to provide timely coverage of patients on the Service, or consultation on other services including the Em ergency Department. Attending Morning Report. Planning the biweekly Professor's Rounds, including case selection and organization. Planning the on -call and other house staff scheduling (after the first few months, this may be delegated to the Junior Reside nt). Participating in Outpatient Clinics. Overseeing Resident Work Rounds during the week. Coordinating rounding schedules and resident responsibilities for the weekend days. Ward Service Junior Neurology Resident - Although not the neurologist of record (since this is the Attending Physician) , the Junior Resident serves as the neurolog y Ward team member who is the primary interfac e with the patient (and family, associates, etc.). S/he provides documentation of the patient's illness, manages and schedules tests, and deals with the logistics of care with the assistance of the PGY1 (when available). This resident will usually carry the 'Ward Service Pager' ( 415-327-WARD ) during the day. Rounds each weekday on all patients on the service, and on weekends assigned, overseeing evaluation and care during these rounds. After the initial months of the new academic year, the Junior Resident can 'run' these rounds at the discretion of the Senior Residen t. Provides a full admission note emphasizing neurologic aspects of diagnosis, formulation, planned evaluations and therapies. Provides independent daily progress notes summarizing the patient's status (including disposition) , analysis and formulation of d iagnosis and plan. The junior Ward resident also review s, amends, and co -signs medical student notes. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 5 Presents patients to the Attending or Professor on Rounds if the students are not available for this duty. Additionally, presents and demonstrates the sal ient neurological findings and discusses diagnosis and rationale of the plan at the bi -weekly \"Professor's Rounds\" Clinical Case Conference. Attends Morning Report. Participates in Outpatient Clinics Student Clerks - The primary responsibility of medical students relates to their education. However, because the Service adheres to the general philosophy that their active participation in the patient care team is an important vehicle for education, the students will also participate in the care activities. T hese include: Rounding daily on all patients on the Service . Assisting in patient care by: evaluating assigned patients on admission, following those patients daily, performing (under direct supervision) lumbar punctures and similar procedures on these pa tients, contributing daily notes summarizing results of diagnostic studies, patient status and changes in therapies and plans (not to substitute for the Resident notes), and contributing a recent review of the literature as a further guide to those caring for the patient. The students should also summarize the Attending Round evaluation of patients, including the principal new find ings revealed by the history and examination and the diagnostic opinion and plan provided by the Attending Neurologist. Neurology Inpatient Consultation Service s The Neurology Inpatient Consultation Services are divided into two components: an Adult Neurology Consultation Service and a Child Neurology Consultation Service. Together they provide specialized neurological con sultation for the other inpatient services, the Emergency Department and, when needed, outpatient clinics of ZSFG . They are staffed by an Attending Neurologist assigned to each Service who assumes ultimate responsibility for the performance of the Services and the care delivered, and a Junior Resident who is the focus of the activities of both components. A student subPGY1 and MS3 student clerk s may also be assigned to the Service to assist in these tasks. Rules of Consultation Service - In order to provid e optimal service for the care of patients and assistance to the primary physicians caring for patients requiring neurological expertise, there are expectations requiring the timeliness, level of expertise, and communication of this service. These are embo died in the following guidelines: All requested routine consultations will be seen by the consulting resident on the day of the request unless the requesting physician directly stipulates that a delay of up to 48 hours is acceptable. This means that consu ltations not seen by the daytime coverage will be evaluated by the resident on duty at night. SubPGY1 students may evaluate these patients, first, but the resident will still see them on the same day. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 6 All urgent consultations will be seen by the consulting resident within two hours of request and emergency consultations seen even more rapidly. Exceptions may relate to conflicts among urgent patients; these should be explicitly triaged by the consultation resident in agreement with the requesting physician o r seen by another resident (e.g. Ward resident) if needed. Acute Stroke Activations represent an important exception to the expected time of evaluation. Acute Stroke Activations (also referred to as \"Stroke Codes\") are formal emergency activation in the hospital which specify the location of the relevant patient. Neurology residents are expected to respond in person immediately (physical presence within 5 minutes), and in the rare case in which they are performing a procedure (e.g. lumbar puncture) that c annot be safely immediately interrupted, then they are to call the hospital location (usually ED) in order to notify of the delay. All adult inpatients should be presented to and evaluated by the Attending Adult Neurologist within 24 hours of the requested consultation. Difficult or urgent patients should be discussed by telephone or directly evaluated more rapidly. Exceptions include Emergency Department consultations in which patients are discharged; these cases should be discussed before discharge or ret rospectively the next day, depending upon the complexity of the pr oblem. Patients evaluated on Sa turday may be reviewed and evaluated by the Attending on Monday if they are not complex and such review is not urgent. In the case of patients seen in the Emergency Department or outpatient clinics during daytime hours who clearly require admission to the Neurology Ward or Neurocritical Care Service, the Consultation Resident should serve as a triage officer. This entails entering a brief note, seeing that emergency management is begun and that appropriate laboratory studies are ordered, and then turning the patient over to the Inpatient Service team for definitive admission evaluation (and admission note) and care. The exc eption to this policy will be when the inpatient resident team is not immediately available due to other patient care responsibilities; Attending Rounds are not a sufficient reason for the Inpatient Resident Staff to defer this task. The conclusions and re commendations of the Consultation Service should be clearly and rapidly communicated to the physicians of the primary service caring for the patient. This principally involves inclusion of the consultation note in the chart with designation of who has revi ewed the case. For non -routine consultations and at times for routine consultations as well, the resident is also responsible for more active communication to the physicians requesting the consult . This entails direct telephone contact and discussion or, under certain circumstances, faxing of a copy of the Consultation Note or e -mail communication. In some cases, the Attending Physician will undertake telephone communication. All contact and communication with other services, as well as with nursing and oth er personnel should be conducted with the highest level of professionalism and courtesy. Residents must recognize that there is no such thing as an \"inappropriate\" request for consultation or assistance. If assistance is requested, it is needed. The respo nsibilities and expectations of the members of the team are outlined as follows: Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 7 Attending Adult Neurologist - The Attending Adult Neurologist is responsible for the overall quality of the Consultation Service. This physician must review all patients consulted. With the exceptions enumerated above (discharged ED patients) this entails direct evaluation of the patients in a timely (within 24 hours) manner. More urgent consultation are discussed by telephone or directly seen within a shorter time frame depending upon the complexity or urgency of the problem. In the case of those patients directly evaluated, a note reflecting the evaluation and describing any additions or corrections of the resident's evaluation (or students and resident's notes) as well as a clear set of recommendations should be placed in the chart. In brief, the Attending: Oversees all aspects of the Consultation Service, assuring the quality of its evaluations, recommendations and service delivery. Evaluates and provides a note on all patients within 24 hours of the request. This note should clearly articulate the problem and recommendations and also invite further questions and discussion if needed. Reviews in detail all patients seen by the resident but not available for direct evaluation (e.g. ED patients). A designee such as the Neurology attending supervising Morning Report may serve this fun ction. Attending Child Neurologist - The practice and standards for the Attending Child Neurologists are the same as for the Attending Adult Neurologist as just described with the exception that when emergency consultation is needed and the Attending Child Neurologist is not directly available, the ZSFG Pediatrics Service will contact the Child Neurology Fellow on call at UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital by telephone for advice. If bedside immediate evaluation is deemed necessary (such as in the case of a critically ill child) , an adult neurologist may initiate the Attending duties (Consult Attending if child age > 17, Neurocritical Care Attending if child is admitted to the hospital and is critically ill) until the Child Neurolog y Attending or Fellow is available. Neurology Consultation Resident - This individual serves as the focus of the Service, triaging all Consultations and evaluating all patients seen during the daytime hours as well as following up on all patients evaluated by the covering residents during night or weekend hours. This resident is the primary interface of the Neurology Service with other services in the Hospital. S/he is therefore expected to provide courteous, friendly and willing service at all times. Their evaluation of patients sh ould address the broad spectrum of patient needs conveyed by the individuals caring for these patients. This resident will be responsible for the Consultation pager (415-327-NERV) carrying it during the daytime and passing it on to the night or weekend cal l resident. Among the specific responsibilities are the following: Evaluation of consultations in the various venues (inpatient wards, ED and outpatient clinics) following the time guidelines above. Providing an initial note at the time of the initial evaluation (designated, \"will present to the Service Attending\" or the like before evaluation by the Attending) in the medical record , and pr oviding follow -up notes as indicated (usually at least every other day, depending upon the patient's condition and the availability of results of diagnostic studies Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 8 and the effects of therapeutic intervention). If patients are no longer to be followed by t he Service, an explicit note in the chart should say this and invite re -consultation as needed. Supervising student sub -PGY1 and MS3 clerks on the Service and directly evaluating any patients seen by these individuals before they are presented to the Atten ding Neurologist. This requires an independent note by the resident documenting her/his examination and finds. Communication with the primary service as outlined above. Attending Morning Report. Student Clerk - The primary responsibility of medical students relates to their education. However, because the Service adheres to the general philosophy that their active participation in the patient care team is an important vehicle for education, the students will a lso participate in the care activities. These include: Rounding daily with the Consult Service. Assisting in patient care by: evaluating assigned patients and following those patients as appropriate. The students should also summarize the Attending Round evaluation of patients, including the principal new findings revealed by the history and examination and the diagnostic opinion and plan provided by the Attending Neurologist. Inpatient Neurocritical Care Service The Neurocritical Care Service provides primary and consultative coverage for patients with critical neurological conditions. These include patients with acute stroke, neurotrauma, seizures, and neuromuscular conditions. Additionally patients on other clin ical services, including neurosurgery, trauma surgery, medical intensive care, and cardiology, who have critical neurological issues are seen. The Neurocritical Care Service provides faculty coverage for acute stroke intervention as part of the Primary Str oke Center and comprehensive stroke center services. Neurocritical Care Attending - The Neurocritical Care Attending will assume supervision of care for patients on the Neurology Service while they are in the ICU. S/he will directly evaluate and provide an admission note on all new patients within 24 hours of admission to the ICU and earlier in indicated by the type or complexity of the illness. S/he will directly evaluate and complete a progress note on all patients daily . Attending notes may be complet ed by a neurocritical care fellow with faculty status as a Clinical Instructor who is in a non-ACGME position . S/he will generally confer with and communicate with the Neurology Neurocritical Care resident in supervising this component of the Service. S/he will directly participate in all decision regarding invasive diagnostic studies, therapy and life support. Since the Service is committed to functioning as a 'Resident -Run' service, the Neurocritical Care Attending Physician needs to make judgments and ad justments with respect to when s/he needs to assume the primary physician role and when s/he can Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 9 delegate this role to the resident staff. This will depend on the individual capabilities of the resident and on the complexity and nature of the patients' ill nesses. However, all major decisions and procedures will be reviewed by the Neurocritical Care Attending. At all times, the Neurocritical Care Attending must be sufficiently familiar with the details of the patients' management to assure that optimal care is being administered. The latter includes not only the accuracy of diagnosis and the appropriateness of therapies, but also the manner and thoroughness of communication with families and other personnel involved in the patients' overall care. The Attendin g must set and assure the standards with respect to professionalism and highest ethical and personal interactions. The Neurocritical Care Attending w ill staff the weekly Stroke Clinic. The Neurocritical Care Attending will be available by pager and telepho ne 24 hours a day. Neurocritical Care Fellow - As ZSFG is a principle teaching institution for the UCSF Neurocritical Care fellowship, the Neurocritical Care Fellow will serve the function as team leader for morning work rounds. The fellow will also serve as the primary contact for the Neurology Consult resident regarding a cute stroke and neurocritical care cases. Neurocritical Care Neurology Resident - The Neurology resident rotating on the Neurocritical Care Service will be responsible for daily rounding and notes on all patients on the Neurocritical Care Service. This resident will be responsible for ordering or recommending tests and treatments for s ervice patients. Additionally, the resident will Serve as the primary conduit for communication with families of patients on the Neurology Service in the ICU. Serve as the primary conduit for communication with other clinical services seeking neurocritica l care consultation Provide basic teaching to the student clerk on the service Student Clerk - The primary responsibility of medical students relates to their education. However, because the Service adheres to the general philosophy that their active participation in the patient care team is an important vehicle for education, the students will also participate in the care activities. These include: Rounding daily with the Neurocritical Care Service. Assisting in patient care by: evaluating assigned patie nts and following those patients as appropriate. The students should also summarize the Attending Round evaluation of patients, including the principal new findings revealed by the history and examination and the diagnostic opinion and plan provided by the Attending Neurologist. Neurology Resident In -house Night Coverage Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 10 Resident Night Coverage - Neurology overnight in -house coverage is provided seven days a week by a Night Resident who serves from approximately 7 PM through Morning Report the next day. This night coverage system was instituted in response to changes in housestaff duty hours. The overnight resident will handle all consultations and ove rsee the care of the Ward and Neurocritical Care patients during this period. S/he will also be available by telephone as a resource for advice and consultation by the SFHN. S/he will carry all service pagers during this time. All admission and consultati ons will be 'checked out' with the daytime r esident staff before or during Morning R eport or in a sign -out session on the weekends . Cases requiring attending or fellow input will be discussed by telephone or by direct presentation to the Attending or Neurocritical Care Fellow/Attending on call. Neurology Outpatient Clinics As Neurology evolves increasingly to an outpatient specialty, the importance of this activity will c ontinue to increase, both with respect to service delivery and teaching. The outpatient clinic activity of the Adult Service now uses the 4M Clinics facility and includes three regular weekly sessions: two General New Patient clinics ( Thursday afternoon and Friday morning) and one follow -up clinic (Tuesday afternoon). There are also four subspecialty clinics: a weekly Stroke Clinic , a monthly Geriatics -Neuro Clinic , a monthly Neuroimmunology Clinic which is imbedded into a new patient clinic , and a monthly Epilepsy Clinic . The Child Neurology Clinic meets Friday mornings in the Pediatric area. Because the allotted time (including room and nurse availability) for the principal Neurology Clinics is constrained, it is critical that the clinics start on time and that patient flow is maintained so that they can end on time as well. Attendings, Residents and Students are therefore expected to arrive on time. The Clinics have become important teaching vehicles for students, expanding their range and volume of experience. This must continue, yet not unduly inconvenience patients nor impede patient 'throughput.' Much of the patient care in the clinics is performed by Residents for similar reasons, along with economic considerations. The following outlines some of the responsibilities of the personnel in the Adult Neurology Clinics. Attending Neurologists - Usually three Attendings are assigned to each New Patient clinic session and two or three to the Follow -up clinic session. Their duties include: teaching students and PGY1s and directly evaluating in detail all their patients; overseeing residents and any nurse practitioners , applying the principles of graduated responsibility described earlie r; and direct evaluation of patients as needed to facilitate patient flow. Their activities in this context include: Directing the Clinic. One of the Attending Neurologists in each clinic will assume the role of director for that session. Associated dutie s include triaging (when each patient is to be seen, by whom, and into which room); assigning patients based on their complexity and suitability for teaching is an important duty. These activities are important to increase the efficiency of the session and require someone to maintain an overview for the day. Evaluating the patients seen by the students. Each of these patients requires a careful review of history and examination and plan of further evaluation and treatment performed Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 11 by the Attending. The At tending must also plan for follow -up of each of these patients, either by him/herself or my direct assignment to another Attending or Resident. The Attending Physician's note must document the independent complete evaluation, formulation and plan. Evaluati ng patients seen by Residents. The requirement for Attending supervision varies according to the experience and capability of the individual residents, as well as the problem of the patient. Hence, the supervision requirements range from careful and thorou gh assessment of new patients seen by PGY1s or beginning first -year Neurology Residents to brief review of the findings and plan of Senior Residents seeing patients in follow -up. The Attending Physician is responsible for knowing the patient flow and assig nments and providing judgment regarding the supervisory needs of the patients being seen. Direct evaluation of patients. Because of the need to maintain patient flow and the limited value of some patients as 'teaching cases,' the Attending Neurologist assi gned to Clinic often needs to join directly in the effort to evaluate patients not seen by the Resident, PGY1s or Students. In these instances, the Attending will assume full responsibility for care of these patients or triage for resident follow -up. Neurology Residents - The Neurology residents providing Outpatient Service to ZSFG do this as part of an independent outpatient rotation, as well as during their inpatient rotation at the Hospital and during other rotations when they participate in their Cont inuity Clinic here. Adult Neurology New Patient Clinics: Neurology residents on the dedicated outpatient rotation at ZSFG as well as mixed outpatient rotations across the UCSF -staffed hospitals staff the adult Neurology New Patient Clinics. The Neurology Residents assigned to the ZSFG Ward and Consult services also participate in a limited role in the ZSFG Adult Neurology New Patient Clinics, usually once weekly . At the early Junior level, the resident's patients will usually be reviewed in some detail wit h the Attending , while at the Senior level the review is much less detailed. Since this is a graduated process, the judgment of how much supervision is needed should be determined by the Attending Physician. It is imperative that the Residents arrive in th e clinic on time and that they begin seeing patients as soon as they are available. Results of evaluations should be conveyed to the referring physicians by computer ized note , fax, e -mail or telephone. Adult Neurology Follow -up Clinics: Each UCSF Neurology Resident maintains a continuity clinic at ZSFG and they generally staff this clinic once monthly during the time slot for the Adult Neurology Follow -up Clinics. The residents should consider the clinic as a time assignment rather than strictly on the basi s of patients scheduled. In general, they will see only those patients that they have been following long -term. However, if they are not fully booked with follow -up patients, they will be assigned to evaluate either patients that are new to them, but who w ere seen in new patient clinic by a provider who does not have a follow -up clinic, or follow -up patients who need to be seen before the availability of their 'continuity' neurologist permits. Assignment will be made by the Attending Physician supervising t he clinic session. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 12 Child Neurology Clinic: these clinics are staffed by Child Neurology fellows and attendings as designated. Neurodiagnostic Laboratory The Neurodiagnostic Laboratory represent a joint enterprise with ZSFG in which the Neurology Service provides the professional expertise in overseeing and interpreting test results and the Hospital provides the facilities, equipment and technical support. This document considers only the aspects supplied by the Neurology Service - the \"professional component.\" The Laboratory is organized into two sections operating separately except for aspects of scheduling and support: EEG, and EMG. EEG - the EEG Laboratory is an important resource for patient care with its value relating principally, although not exclusively, to the diagnosis of seizure disorders and toxic -metabolic brain disease. The EEG's are interpreted by one of the Neurology Attend ings who provides special expertise in EEG and epilepsy. It is important that this is done on a timely basis. Networking arrangements allow digital EEG records to be transmitted. The scheduling and responsibility for the timeliness of service is assumed by the Clinic clerks, in conjunction with the technician. In addition to the high -level specialized expertise, the requirements of the Laboratory include: Timely interpretation of records. Interpretation of routine records should be within 72 hours and inte rpretation of urgent records within 12 hours. If requested, these reports can be available to the referring physician immediately after reading by voice, fax or computer entry into the medical record. The office can be contacted for an earlier reading. While it is desirable that scheduling of routine testing occurs within one week of request, current resources do not allow this. Exceptions for both inpatients and outpatients will be triaged by the Senior Neurology Resident. Emergency EEG's are occasionally performed by the Neurology Residents after hours. This extra service will vary with the training of the resident on call, the medical need and the concomitant workload with the decision being made by the resident, after evaluating the patient, in consultat ion with the Consult Attending. EMG - The EMG Laboratory likewise provides a needed on -site facility for evaluation of nerve and muscle disorders. Since the EMG examination is more akin to a physician consultation than to a simple (mechanized) laboratory test, the professional staff is rate -limiting for this facility. The Director of this Laboratory will assure not only the quality of the Service, but its timeliness, in order to assure high standards of care for the Hospital and Neurology Services at ZSFG . The goals of the laboratory are to provide timely and quality service similar to that of EEG, including: Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 13 Availability of the unit for scheduling routine studies as soon as possible, and for acute needs (e.g. for diagnosis of myasthenia gravis or inpatie nt studies) within two days of request. Unfortunately, due to other responsibilities, the availability of the present Director is limited and, hence, there are unwanted delays in scheduling studies. Urgent studies are performed upon request, however. Repor ts should be available to the referring physician immediately after reading by voice, fax or computer entry into the medical record. The office can be contacted for an earlier reading. Conferences and Rounds The formal aspects of the teaching and patient care activities of the Service are structured in a series of conferences and rounds. Some of these are included in the schedule that follows in this document. The structure and purpose are discussed here. House Staff Work Rounds - This is a critical aspe ct of patient care. Th ese are the daily morning work rounds on the various services and involv e the residents and students assigned to the specific services. During these rounds all inpatients on the Neurology Ward Service are evaluated by direct examinati on and chart (including laboratory results) review, and the plans for diagnosis and treatment are discussed, reviewed and assigned for implementation. These begin first thing in the morning, usually at 7:00 A.M. (Monday through Friday). On Neurocritical Ca re Work Rounds, patients on the Neurosurgery Service are seen beginning at 7:00 A.M. each weekday, with other patients on the Neurocritical Care Service to follow. Neurology Consult work rounds are usually done prior to Morning Report by the Inpatient Neur ology Consultation Resident. Residents from the various services then meet at Morning Report. Morning Report - This is held each weekday and is attended by the neurology Residents assigned to ZSFG inpatient Neurology services and the night coverage Resident. The primary purpose of this exercise relates to Quality Management of the Service, with teaching an important secondary goal. All new inpatients seen by any of the adult inpatient services (Ward , Consultation , Neurocritical Car e) will be briefly (beginning with a concise one minute synopsis) presented to the Chief of Service or their designee , and those presenting diagnostic or therapeutic difficulty will be highlighted for further discussion. This includes patients seen in the ED and sent home. Similarly, any active or unsettled diagnostic or therapeutic issues with patients admitted or initially consulted earlier will be discussed. The Attending neurologists rotating on the inpatient services are encouraged but not required to attend Morning Report. The objective of this exercise is to provide a consistent and uniform level of care and oversight for the Neurology Service through this common reporting mechanism. This also facilitates subspecialty consultation and entry of patient s into clinical research protocols. Consult Attending Rounds - These are held daily and are a mixture of patient care (first priority) and teaching rounds. Teaching is at the Resident level and directed to issues of diagnosis and practical management. The timing of these rounds will vary with the Attending's schedule of other activities but generally will begin either early in the morning or in the afternoon, allowing all patients to be evaluated by the Attending within 24 hours of the consultation. Proble m or Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 14 difficult diagnosis/management patients will be staffed outside of this schedule. When the regular Attending assigned to this rotation for the month cannot be available, another Neurologist needs to be available to substitute. Ward Attending Rounds - During these rounds the Attending Neurologist reviews (visiting each patient and reviewing their diagnostic studies and progress generally) the Service with the Senior resident (and/or Junior resident if available) and completes the Attending note s. These notes are generally brief and relate to overall diagnostic and care summary issues; they are supplementary, but not a substitute for the more detailed Resident notes. These are almost exclusively patient care rounds with some supplementary teachin g if time allows. These rounds are generally done immediately after Morning Report each weekday and in the mornings on weekends. Neurocritical Care Attending Rounds - These are held daily after Morning Report. Patients are presented to the Neurocritical Care Attending by the student or resident primarily responsible for the patient. Diagnostic and treatment plans are reviewed and updated. These rounds also serve an important teaching function and may be supplemented by didactic teaching and medical literature review when appropriate. Professor's Rounds - This conference is held on Tuesday mornings, usually biweekly. One or two cases are presented to a visiting profes sor. They will generally be chosen from the inpatient and outpatient services because: 1) they represent interesting examples of diagnoses that are worthy of sharing with others, or 2) represent difficult diagnostic or management problems. The Senior Resid ent on the Ward Service will be responsible for organizing the cases and seeing that the patients and other material (neuroimages, electrophysiology) are available for review. For the Case Conferences, the Junior Resident will generally present the case (s uccinctly) and demonstrate the relevant (but not extraneous) findings; the Junior or Senior Resident will also present a brief review of the problem related to the major issues exemplified by the patient. Participation by physicians and consultants from ot her services is encouraged. Neuroimaging Conference - This is presented by Neuroradiology in combination with Neurology and Neurosurgery every Wednesday . A list of cases to be presented is submitted by the Junior Ward Resident the afternoon before the con ferences; late additions may be added on to the conference. Additionally, on other days pertinent neuroimages will be reviewed with the Neuroradiology staff on an ad hoc basis. Resident Neurology Didactic Conference - This is a weekly conference, usually at noon on Mondays, during which a faculty member provides an educational lecture on a specific topic directed at residents and students. As part of this, once a month there is a journal club in which a specific article of interest is reviewed and once a m onth there is a Neurology M&M session in which the Senior Ward resident reviews one or more cases for quality improvement purposes.

Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 19 Appendix E - ZSFG Neurology Ward and Consult Attending Expectations ZSFG Ward Attending Expectations 2022 -2023 Typical ward attending schedule Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday 7:30 AM - 8:00 AM Morning report Morning report 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM Attending rounds Attending rounds Attending rounds Attending rounds Attending rounds 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM Conference (3C + Zoom) Assisting in completing tasks 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM Assisting in completing tasks Neuroradiology conference (HB 247 + Zoom) 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM Assisting in completing tasks Resident clinic (4M) Daily clinical responsibilities 1. The ward attending is expected to be on the SFGH campus during regular working hours each weekday for clinical, teaching, and supervisory duties. Workspace will be made available for attendings from non -SFGH sites. a. If an attending must leave campus during this time for other professional activities, they are expected to be available by pager and/or cell phone. The attending should be available to return to campus during regular working hours to assist in patient care if needed. b. The ward attending serves as secondary attending for consults when the consult attending is in clinic and can staff ED consults being discharged home when schedule allows. This should not significantly delay the patient's discharge from the ED. 2. Attendings must be available each week day and during assigned weekends to round with the ward resident. a. Weekdays: Attending rounds are from 9AM -10:45AM M -Th and 9AM -11AM on Friday. Any patient not seen by the end of rounds will be seen by the attending alone (students and rotators also allowe d to accompany if not otherwise needed, but the neurology residents should be dismissed to begin the work of the day). i. Seeing stable follow -up patients without the residents and then \"card flipping\" during rounds is acceptable before going to see the new patients and anyone who is unstable as a team. The specific style of rounds can be coordinated between the attending and the Ward Senior resident. ii. The last 5 minutes of rounds should be reserved to divide tasks for the day, including the tasks with which t he attending can assist (i.e. calling families, running family meetings, calling PCPs or other outpatient providers, assisting with LPs, etc.) Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 20 b. The ward attending is expected to attend multidisciplinary rounds with the junior resident, Utilization Management, Social Work, and PT/OT/SLP. These are currently held in person in H4009 M -Th from 10:45AM -11AM. c. If there are lower level of care (LLOC) patients on the service with complex discharge needs, the attending h as the opportunity to discuss barriers to discharge with UM/SW leadership during Complex Care Rounds on Thursday from 1:25PM -1:35PM via Zoom (call information in Cate's orientation email). The team SW can guide if this conversation is needed during the tea m's MDR M -Th. d. If the ward attending is scheduled for Neuro -New Clinic on Friday morning, rounds should occur prior to clinic starting at 9AM (being attentive to morning report from 7:30AM -8:00AM and to restrictions on the time residents are allowed to com e in in the morning). The recommendation is for this to occur as work rounds (aka discovery rounds) where the attending joins the residents during their normal pre -rounding process from 8AM -9AM. e. If the ward resident is scheduled for Neuro -New Clinic on Fri day morning, rounds can occur prior to clinic starting (as above) or can occur with the remaining resident in the typical fashion. The specific workflow should be coordinated between the attending and Ward Senior. f. Weekends: See below for further details. It is strongly recommended that rounds with the residents be completed by 11AM on Saturday and Sunday. 3. The ward attending is expected to assist in ensuring no resident violates duty hour requirements . a. The attending is expected to check in with the Ward Sen ior at 3PM M -F to discuss updates for the patients, determine what tasks still need to be completed (or assist the resident to triage what work can be deferred to the following day), and assist in completing any necessary tasks to ensure the residents are able to sign out on time. Examples of tasks include, but are not limited to, calling families, calling PCPs or other outpatient providers, writing patient letters or filling out disability paperwork. b. The attending and ward residents will receive an email e ach Wednesday and Thursday morning detailing the number of hours worked by the residents that week (calculated Sunday to Saturday). Residents are not allowed to work >79 hours. The attending should work with the resident to ensure they stay within those re quirements. If further coverage is needed, jeopardy will be activated to cover the remaining hours of the week. c. To meet duty hour requirements, each Ward resident is given 2 Tuesdays off / month (alternating Ward Senior and Ward Junior). The attending is expected to assist in completion of the necessary tasks for the day. This can include, but is not limited to, writing progress notes for the day (attending only templates have been shared), coordinating follow up appointments with PCPs, family updates, run ning family meetings or performing LPs. Specific workflow needs for the day should be an ongoing discussion between the resident and attending during the day to ensure the resident signs out on time. d. On the day a resident is assigned to swing shift (cross cover and consults between 5 - 7PM) they are not to come in prior to 7:30AM. Pre -rounding duties may therefore be incomplete prior to rounds. Flexibility in workflows to accommodate this on rounds is encouraged (i.e., seeing patients together that were not seen during pre -rounds, reviewing labs or imaging in the moment on rounds, etc.). e. Residents must have at least 8 hours off between shifts. On rare occasions, this may result in a resident needing to come in later than 7:30 am. On such occasions, the resident is expected to notify their attending by email upon leaving the hospital of their expected arrival time the next morning. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 21 f. The attending running morning report will check in with night float to ensure their work can be completed and that they leave no later than 9AM . The recommendation is for residents to complete the notes for any patient they sent home from the ED followed by any admission notes (ICU then ward) followed by any inpatient consult notes. Any notes not completed can be shared and complete d by the appropriate day resident. 4. Notes / EHR responsibilities a. Each patient must be seen daily (7 days a week) and an attending attestation must be written for each resident note . The attestations are templated to optimize billing (see Epic PowerPoint f or screen shots of how to access). The attestation must be signed no later than 8AM the day following the attending's evaluation (i.e. if the patient is seen on Monday during rounds, the attestation is required by 8AM Tuesday morning). b. All newly admitted patients must have an H&P from the attending in the chart within 24 hours of hospital admission. This occurs in the form of the attending attestation to the resident H&P OR attestation to the initial consultation note (marking clearly in that attestation that that is the H&P and not consultation only note). The H&P attestation is templated to optimize billing (see Epic PowerPoint). If the resident H&P was signed after midnight, no resident progress note is needed the day the patient is first staffe d by the attending (ex: if admitted by night float and the H&P signed after midnight on Tuesday, staffed during rounds on Tuesday, no resident progress note is needed for Tuesday). If, however, the H&P is signed before midnight, the resident must write a p rogress note for the following day (ex: admitted by night float and note signed Monday before midnight, staffed by the attending on rounds Tuesday, attending attests the H&P and the resident progress note for Tuesday). The attestation for the progress note can refer to the H&P attestation (a dot phrase for this that you can use - \".nlrhp\") but the progress note must still be attested. c. Residents are expected to write a discharge summary on the day of discharge for each patient. This counts as the note for t he day and does not require an additional progress note. d. The resident notes for patients who were discharged home without being staffed by an attending should be signed by the ward attending on the days they are assigned for morning report. These notes do not require the attestation template, and require only a statement that the patient was not personally interviewed or examined by the attending, that you agree with the recommendations as stated (or adjust those recommendations in the attestation dependin g on the conversation), and that it is not a billable note. (Feel free to steal the dot phrase created with this wording - \".nlreddc\") e. On the first day of the rotation, the attending must reassign themselves as the attending for all ward patients (see Epic PowerPoint for screenshots on how to do this). This is essential to ensure Secure Chat messages are appropriately routed. f. Each weekday and assigned weekend, the ward attending must check their inbox for orders and PT/OT/SLP documentation to co -sign (see Epic PowerPoint for instructions). i. The PT/OT/SLP services will send their initial evaluation notes to you to co -sign. Do not attest , just click the \"co -sign\" button and cancel any charge session that pops up automatically. This serves as confirmation that you authorize their treatment plan but does not trigger billing on our end. ii. Each newly admitted patient must have an \"admit to inpatient\" order OR \"admit to observation\" order signed within 24 hours of admission. This order will be in your Epic inbox to c o-sign. If the patient will be in the hospital for 2 or more midnights, they should be admitted to \"inpatient\". If in the hospital overnight only, the order should be for \"observation\" (the residents will know how to change the order type if needed). Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 22 5. Clinic: For most weeks, the ward attending will be assigned to staff one half day of resident clinic each week. Typically, this is the Neuro -New Clinic on Thursday from 1PM -5PM, however will occasionally be the resident continuity clinic on Tuesday 1PM -5PM or the Neuro -New Clinic on Friday from 9AM -12PM (see Cate Freyer's orientation email for assignment). a. During clinic, the ward attending is expected to staff patients with the residents and NPs (including physically seeing all new patients), sign Epic attesta tions (see Epic PowerPoint guide for screenshots), and co -sign resident orders/prescriptions as needed. Weekends, Call and Signout 1. It is the responsibility of the ward and consult attendings to divide up the weekends during their half-month block. 2. When covering a weekend, the attending is responsible for staffing all ward patients and all new and active follow -up consult patients. It is not expected for the attending to be onsite all day to staff new consults/admits in the afternoon. 3. The consult and ward attending will split night and weekend call. Call entails receiving calls from the residents overnight to discuss patient management , logistics, or other questions. 4. It is the responsibility of the ward and consult attendings to create a call and weekend schedule and submit this to Cate Freyer before the start of their half -month block. 5. Attendings who are covering the weekend will take call from 5 PM on Friday until 7:30 AM (beginning of morning report) on Monday. 6. Weekday night call starts at 5PM and ends at 7:30AM the following day. 7. The attending must sign out the service either verbally or via email to the incoming attending at the e nd of the rotation and each weekend for which they are not working. Conference and teaching responsibilities 1. Conferences a. Attendings are expected to attend neuroradiology conference every Wednesday at 1pm. These occur both in person and via Zoom. b. Attendings are welcome to attend Monday educational conferences and are particularly encouraged to attend the journal club and M&M conferences for the month. These occur in person in 3C as well as over Zoom. c. Attendings are welcome to attend 4 -Hospital morn ing report, which occurs once per month from 8AM -9AM (see morning report schedule in Cate Freyer's orientation email for details). 2. Teaching / feedback a. Attendings are encouraged to sign up to provide a 1 -hour didactic educational session during their half -month rotation, if space is available. This can cover a topic of their choosing, be a formal presentation or chalk talk, and can be a talk (or variation of a talk) they have previously given. b. Attendings are primarily responsible for medical student teachin g. This includes weekly clinical vignettes with the student rotating on the ward service. The students have access to these vignettes, and you will receive an email from Karl Kanner with the faculty guide for the vignettes. The goal is to review 2 -4 with t he student / week when the service schedule allows (if service is busy with good patient mix, vignettes can be deferred). c. Attendings are also encouraged to give informal chalk talks to students, rotators and residents as time allows. d. Attendings are require d to perform an observed exam with the students rotating on the ward service. This should be scheduled at the end of week 2 or the beginning of week 3 of the students' rotation block. The goal of this exercise is to provide feedback on exam techniques for the student, both verbally after the observation as well as through a feedback form the student will send through MedHub. Ideally, the student would not be Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 23 familiar with the patient at the time of the exam, and the patient should speak English if possible. e. Attendings will provide verbal feedback to students and residents and evaluate them using MedHub at the end of the half -month rotation (although mid -rotation verbal feedback is also welcomed). i. Student MedHub evaluations are due within 1 week of the end of their rotation f. Attendings may also be asked to fill out BBOTs (Brief Bridges Observational Tool) for the students. These are brief feedback forms sent to the attending through MedHub to reflect feedback given on presentations, exam, or other aspects of cl inical care. The students are also able to fill these forms out themselves and send to the attending for review. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 24 ZSFG Consult Attending Expectations 2022 -2023 Typical consult attending schedule Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday 7:30 AM- 8:00 AM Morning report Morning report 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM Attending rounds Attending rounds Attending rounds Attending rounds Attending rounds 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM Conference (3C + Zoom) 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM Neuroradiology conference (HB 247 + Zoom) 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM Staffing ED consults Resident clinic (4M) Staffing ED consults Staffing ED consults Staffing ED consults Daily clinical responsibilities 6. The consult attending is expected to be on the SFGH campus during regular working hours each weekday for clinical, teaching, and supervisory duties. Workspace will be made available for attendings from non -SFGH sites. a. If an attending must leave campus dur ing this time for other professional activities, they are expected to be available by pager and/or cell phone. The attending should be available to return to campus during regular working hours to staff a patient if needed. b. The consult attending serves as a secondary attending when the ward attending is in clinic and can assist in clinical tasks (including, but not limited to, discussing clinical questions or assisting with LPs) as needed. 7. Attendings must be available each weekday and during assigned weeken ds to round with the consult resident. a. Weekdays: Attending rounds are from 9AM -11AM M -F. Any patient not seen by 11AM will be seen by the attending alone (students and rotators also allowed to accompany if not otherwise needed, but the neurology resident should be dismissed to begin the work of the day). b. If the attendi ng or resident is scheduled for Neuro -New Clinic on Friday morning, rounds should occur prior to clinic starting at 9AM (being attentive to morning report from 7:30AM -8:00AM and to restrictions on the time residents are allowed to come in in the morning). The recommendation is for this to occur as work rounds (aka discovery rounds) where the attending joins the resident during their normal pre -rounding process from 8AM -9AM. c. Weekends: See below for further details. It is strongly recommended that rounds with the residents be completed by 11AM on Saturday and Sunday. 8. Attendings should make every effort to staff ED consultations throughout the day . a. All new ED consults M -F between 8AM -5PM (within reason) who are being discharged home should be seen and staffed by the consult attending prior to discharge. This should not significantly delay the patient's discharge from the ED. This includes patients seen by Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 25 the night float resident who remain in the ED the following morning if possible. The resident is not requir ed to join the attending to see the patients, depending on workflow, but should discuss their findings and recommendations with the attending prior to the attending staffing the patient. b. The consult attending should provide sign out (either verbal or emai l) to the ward or ICU attending for all consults they staff who are then admitted to the primary neurology service. c. At the discretion of the consult attending and resident, new inpatient consults (med/surg, ICU, inpatient psych, PES and 4A) seen by the res ident after attending rounds can be staffed by the attending the same day or can be staffed the following day during attending rounds. 9. The consult attending is expected to assist in ensuring no resident violates duty hour requirements . a. The attending is ex pected to check in with the resident at 3PM M -F to discuss updates for the patients and plan who needs to be seen the following day, determine what tasks still need to be completed (or assist the resident to triage what work can be deferred to the followin g day), and assist in completing any necessary tasks to ensure the residents are able to sign out on time. This can include, but is not limited to, writing follow up consultation notes or discussing recommendations with teams / patients. b. The attending and consult resident will receive an email each Wednesday and Thursday morning detailing the number of hours worked by the resident that week (calculated Sunday to Saturday). Residents are not allowed to work >79 hours. The attending should work with the resi dent to ensure they stay within those requirements. If further coverage is needed, jeopardy will be activated to cover the remaining hours of the week. c. On the day a resident is assigned to swing shift (cross cover and consults between 5 - 7PM) they are not to come in prior to 7:30AM. Pre -rounding duties may therefore be incomplete prior to rounds. Flexibility in workflows to accommodate this on rounds is encouraged (i.e., seeing patients together that were not seen during pre -rounds, reviewing labs or imagin g in the moment on rounds, etc.). d. Residents must have at least 8 hours off between shifts. On rare occasions, this may result in a resident needing to come in later than 7:30 am. On such occasions, the resident is expected to notify their attending by email upon leaving the hospital of their expected arrival time the next morning. e. The attending running morning report will check in with night float to ensure their work can be completed and that they leave no later than 9AM . The recommendation is for reside nts to complete the notes for any patient they sent home from the ED followed by any admission notes (ICU then ward) followed by any inpatient consult notes. Any notes not completed can be shared and completed by the appropriate day resident. 10. Notes a. All new consults must have an attending attestation within 24 hours of the initial resident note. The attestations are templated to optimize billing (see Epic PowerPoint for screen shots of how to access). The attestation must be signed no later than 8AM the d ay following the attending's initial evaluation (i.e. if the consultation is first staffed on Monday during rounds, the attestation is required by 8AM Tuesday morning). b. All follow -up consults should have a resident note and attending attestation for every day they are seen on rounds. If the resident has not completed the follow -up notes by 3PM, the attending is encouraged to write an attending -only follow -up note for that day. The follow -up attestations and attending -only follow -up notes are templated to o ptimize billing (see Epic PowerPoint for screen shots of how to access). The attestation must be signed no later than 8AM the day following the follow -up evaluation. Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 26 c. The resident notes for patients who were discharged home without being staffed by an attending should be signed by the consult attending on the days they are assigned for morning report. These notes do not require the attestation template, and require only a statement that the patient was not personally interviewed or examined by the attending , that you agree with the recommendations as stated (or adjust those recommendations in the attestation depending on the conversation), and that it is not a billable note. (Feel free to steal the dot phrase I created with this wording - \".nlreddc\") 11. EHR res ponsibilities a. It is recommended that the attending assign themselves as the consult attending in EPIC on the first day of the rotation (details for how to do this are included in Cate's orientation email). This ensures that any primary team will contact th e appropriate person for follow up questions. b. Each assigned weekend, the attending must check their inbox for orders and PT/OT/SLP documentation to co -sign (see Epic PowerPoint for instructions). i. The PT/OT/SLP services will send their initial evaluation notes to you to co -sign. Do not attest , just click the \"co -sign\" button and cancel any charge session that pops up automatically. This serves as confirmation that you authorize their treatment plan but does not trigger billing on our end. ii. Each newly admitted patient must have an \"admit to inpatient\" order OR \"admit to observation\" order signed within 24 hours of admission. This order will be in your Epic inbox to co -sign. If the patient will be in t he hospital for 2 or more midnights, they should be admitted to \"inpatient\". If in the hospital overnight only, the order should be for \"observation\" (the residents will know how to change the order type if needed). 12. Clinic: In most weeks, the consult att ending will be assigned to staff one half day of resident clinic each week. Typically, this is the resident continuity clinic on Tuesday 1PM -5PM, however will occasionally be the Neuro -New Clinic on Thursday 1PM -5PM or Friday 9AM -12PM (see Alexandra Brown' s schedule for assignment). a. During clinic, the consult attending is expected to staff patients with the residents and NPs (including physically seeing all new patients), sign Epic attestations (see Epic PowerPoint guide for screenshots), and co -sign reside nt orders/prescriptions as needed. Weekends, Call and Signout 8. It is the responsibility of the ward and consult attendings to divide up the weekends during their half-month block. 9. When covering a weekend, the attending is responsible for staffing all war d patients and all new and active follow -up consult patients. It is not expected for the attending to be onsite all day to staff new consults/admits in the afternoon. 10. The consult and ward attending will split night and weekend call. Call entails receiving calls from the residents overnight to discuss patient management, logistics, or other questions. 11. It is the responsibility of the ward and consult attendings to create a call and weekend schedule and submit this to Cate Freyer before the start of their half -month block. 12. Attendings who are covering the weekend will take call from 5 PM on Friday until 7:30 AM (beginning of morning report) on Monday. 13. Weekday night call st arts at 5PM and ends at 7:30AM the following day. 14. The attending must sign out the service either verbally or via email to the incoming attending at the end of the rotation and each weekend for which they are not working. Transfers Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital 1001 Potrero Avenue San Francisco, CA 94110 August 8, 2022 27 1. The consult attending is responsible for screening potential transfers to the neurology service, except in the case of neurologic emergencies. The patient will be staffed on attending rounds, and the consult attending will determine if the patient is appropriate for transfer afte r staffing the consult. If the patient is stable, the transfer would then occur at 7AM the following morning, with transfer orders being placed by the ward team and the patient staffed on ward rounds. The consult attending should provide sign out (either v erbal or email) to the ward attending. a. For neurologic emergencies (hemorrhage, status), the transfer request will be triaged through the ICU fellow/attending, and the patient can be transferred immediately once approved. 2. The hospital is currently not tran sferring patients from other facilities. Conference and teaching responsibilities 3. Conferences a. Attendings are expected to attend neuroradiology conference every Wednesday at 1pm. These occur both in person and via Zoom. b. Attendings are welcome to attend Monday educational conferences and are particularly encouraged to attend the journal club and M&M conferences for the month.
