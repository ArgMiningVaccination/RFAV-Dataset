METHODS We used nationally representative surveillance data from 63 emergency departments obtained from 2004 through 2013 to describe visits to U.S. emergency depart - ments because of adverse events related to dietary supplements. RESULTS On the basis of 3667 cases, we estimated that 23,005 (95% confidence interval [CI], 18,611 to 27,398) emergency department visits per year were attributed to adverse events related to dietary supplements. These visits resulted in an estimated 2154 hospitalizations (95% CI, 1342 to 2967) annually. Such visits frequently in - volved young adults between the ages of 20 and 34 years (28.0% of visits; 95% CI, 25.1 to 30.8) and (21.2% of visits; 95% CI, 18.4 to 24.0). After the exclusion of unsupervised ingestion of dietary supplements by children, 65.9% (95% CI, 63.2 to 68.5) of emergency department visits for single-supplement-related adverse events involved herbal or complementary nutritional products; 31.8% (95% CI, 29.2 to 34.3) involved micronutrients. Herbal or complementary nutritional products for weight loss (25.5%; 95% CI, 23.1 to 27.9) and increased energy (10.0%; 95% CI, 8.0 to 11.9) were commonly implicated. Weight-loss or energy products caused 71.8% (95% CI, 67.6 to 76.1) of supplement-related adverse events involving palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia, and 58.0% (95% CI, 52.2 to 63.7) involved persons 20 to 34 years of age. Among adults 65 years of age or older, choking or pill-induced dysphagia or globus caused 37.6% (95% CI, 29.1 to 46.2) of all emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events; micronutrients were implicated in 83.1% (95% CI, 73.3 to 92.9) of these visits. CONCLUSIONS An estimated 23,000 emergency department visits in the United States every year are attributed to adverse events related to dietary supplements. Such visits common - ly involve cardiovascular manifestations from weight-loss or energy products among young adults and swallowing problems, often associated with micronutrients, among older adults.

However, the regula - tory framework differs from that for prescription or over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. Manufac-turers of dietary supplements containing ingre - dients that were introduced after October 15, 1994, are required to notify the FDA before marketing and to provide a rationale for the safety of the ingredients, such as historical use. However, neither safety testing nor FDA approval is required before the marketing of dietary sup - plements. 7 Postmarketing reporting of adverse events by dietary-supplement manufacturers is required only for serious 8 adverse events (e.g., those resulting in hospitalization, significant disability, or death), and voluntary reporting may substantially under - estimate the adverse events associated with dietary supplements. 9,10 Postmarketing regulatory actions to remove adulterated supplement products from the market have received public attention. From 2004 through 2012, more than 200 recalls were issued for dietary supplements containing unap - proved regulated substances or impurities, 11 and calls for changes in oversight have followed.4,12-18 The safety of dietary supplements that are not known to be adulterated remains poorly de - scribed,19 however. Data are lacking to quantify the frequency of adverse events associated with dietary supplements in the United States.4,20-24 We used nationally representative surveillance data to estimate the number of emergency de - partment visits for adverse events related to dietary supplements and to identify the associ - ated characteristics of the patients, products, and types of adverse events. Methods Data Collection We estimated the number of emergency depart - ment visits for adverse events associated with dietary supplements in the United States using 10 years of data (from January 1, 2004, through December 31, 2013) from the 63 hospitals partici - pating in the National Electronic Injury Surveil - lance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance (NEISS-CADES) project conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Preven - tion (CDC), the FDA, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These hospitals make up a nationally representative probability sample drawn from all hospitals with at least six beds and 24-hour emergency departments (excluding psychi - atric and penal institutions) in the United States and its territories, with four strata based on hospital size and a fifth stratum for pediatric hospitals. Trained abstractors at each hospital reviewed the clinical records of every emergency depart - ment visit to identify physician-diagnosed ad - verse events and reported up to 2 implicated products and 10 concomitant products, as de - scribed previously. 25 Abstractors also recorded narrative descriptions of the event, including preceding circumstances, physician diagnoses, testing, treatments administered in the emer - gency department or by emergency medical ser - vices, and patient outcome. Narrative data were coded with the use of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 9.1. Since data collection is considered to be a public health surveillance activity, no approval from institutional ethics committees or review boards was required. 26 Study Definitions Cases were defined as emergency department visits for problems that the treating clinician explicitly attributed to the use of dietary supple - ments.

Additional products that are often used by consumers for comple - mentary health but do not fall under the regula - tory definition of dietary supplements (e.g., topically administered herbal or homeopathic products) were also included in the analysis. Herbal or complementary nutritional products were categorized according to common reasons for use. (For detailed definitions and specific products, see Tables S1 and S2 in the Supple - mentary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) Adverse events were categorized as adverse re - actions, allergic reactions, excess doses, unsuper - vised ingestion by children, or other events (e.g., choking). Cases involving death on the way to the emergency department or after arrival were excluded because death registration practices vary among participating hospitals, and details about event circumstances are often lacking. Visits in - volving intentional self-harm, drug abuse, thera - peutic failures, nonadherence, or withdrawal were also excluded. The categorization of symp - toms was based on MedDRA-coded narratives. Statistical Analysis The Consumer Product Safety Commission weighted cases of adverse events on the basis of the inverse probability of selection after adjust - ment for nonresponse and hospital nonpartici - pation and accounting for changes in the num - ber of U.S. emergency department visits each year. We calculated national estimates as the sum of the number of cases multiplied by their respective weights and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals, using the SURVEYMEANS procedure in SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Insti - tute). Cumulative estimates and corresponding confidence intervals were divided by 10 to calcu - late average annual estimates and confidence intervals. We used the SURVEYFREQ procedure with the Rao-Scott modified chi-square test to assess differences in weighted proportions. We used SURVEYLOGISTIC and SURVEYREG proce - dures to assess linear trends in biennial esti - mates of emergency department visits. Biennial estimates were used to allow trend analyses to be conducted for categories of supplements as - sociated with a small number of cases. We used intercensal estimates from the Census Bureau to calculate population rates. All analyses accounted for weighting and complex sample design. We considered that cumulative estimates of less than 1200, estimates that are based on fewer than 20 cases, or estimates with with coefficients of variation of more than 30% are statistically un - reliable and are thus noted. Analyses of impli - cated products and symptoms were limited to cases in which a single dietary supplement prod - uct was implicated; unsupervised ingestions by children were analyzed separately. Results Supplement-Related Emergency Department Visits On the basis of 3667 cases identified from 2004 through 2013, we calculated an average of 23,005 (95% confidence interval [CI], 18,611 to 27,398) emergency department visits for adverse events associated with dietary supplements an - nually and further estimated that these visits would result in an average of 2154 (95% CI, 1342 to 2967) hospitalizations annually (Table 1). In 88.3% of emergency department visits, clinicians attributed adverse events to only one supplement (as compared with multiple supplements). More than half of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events involved fe - male patients. The mean age of patients who were treated for supplement-related adverse events was 32 years; more than a quarter (28.0%) of emergency department visits that were attribut - ed to supplement-related adverse events involved persons 20 to 34 years of age. Persons 65 years of age or older were more likely to be hospital - ized than were younger persons, with rates of 16.0% and 8.4%, respectively (P = 0.003) (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). One fifth of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events involved unsupervised in - gestion by children. Products Most emergency department visits for unsuper - vised ingestion of supplements by children in - volved a micronutrient product (61.9%; 95% CI, 56.5 to 67.3).

After the exclusion of unsupervised ingestion by children, 65.9% of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events in - volved a single herbal or complementary nutri - tional product; 31.8% involved a single micro - nutrient product ( Table 2). After the exclusion of unsupervised ingestion by children, a weight-loss product was implicated in 25.5% of emergency department visits and an energy product in 10.0% of such visits. According to Sex of Patients Weight-loss products were implicated in an esti - mated 3399 (95% CI, 2618 to 4180) emergency department visits per year by female patients, almost three times the number of emergency department visits by male patients associated with these products (1223; 95% CI, 858 to 1588) (Fig. 1). Of the total number of emergency de - partment visits for supplement-related adverse events, weight-loss products were implicated in 30.4% (95% CI, 27.4 to 33.4) of such visits among female patients, as compared with 17.6% (95% CI, 14.3 to 20.9) among male patients. Sexual-enhancement products or bodybuilding products were implicated in 14.1% (95% CI, 10.5 to 17.7) of emergency department visits for sup - plement-related adverse events among male pa - tients; there were too few cases among female patients to calculate a reliable estimate. According to Age of Patients After the exclusion of unsupervised ingestion by children, micronutrients were implicated in two thirds of emergency department visits for sup - plement-related adverse events among children 4 years of age or younger (67.3%) and adults 65 years of age or older (62.7%) (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). In contrast, herbal or complementary nutritional products were most commonly implicated among the other age groups. Weight-loss products or energy products were implicated in more than half the emergency de - partment visits for supplement-related adverse events among patients 5 to 19 years of age (51.2%; 95% CI, 44.2 to 58.3) and those 20 to 34 years of age (56.4%; 95% CI, 51.8 to 61.1) (Fig. 2). Weight-loss products were implicated in 2661 (95% CI, 1995 to 3326) emergency depart - ment visits per year for supplement-related ad - verse events among patients 20 to 34 years of age, a number similar to that for visits associated with all other products combined among pa - tients in each of the older age groups (Table S5 in Supplementary Appendix).

Symptoms Cardiac symptoms (palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia) were the most common symptoms associated with weight-loss products (in 42.9% of patients) and energy products (in 46.0% of patients) ( Table 3). Weight-loss or energy products were implicated in 71.8% (95% CI, 67.6 to 76.1) of all emergency department visits for supple - ment-related adverse events involving palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia. Most of the visits for cardiac symptoms (58.0%; 95% CI, 52.2 to 63.7) involved persons 20 to 34 years of age. Cardiac symptoms were also commonly documented in emergency department visits attributed to body - building products (49.8%; 95% CI, 34.5 to 65.0) and sexual-enhancement products (37.3%; 95% CI, 25.3 to 49.3). Most patients with palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia associated with sup -plement-related adverse events were discharged from the emergency department (89.9%; 95% CI, 87.2 to 92.6). The most common adverse effects from most micronutrients (excluding iron, calcium, and potassium) were mild-to-moderate allergic reac - tions (40.6%) and swallowing problems (combi choking and pill-induced dysphagia or globus, 41.0%; 95% CI, 32.4 to 49.7). Swallowing problems caused most emergency department visits involving calcium products (54.1%; 95% CI, 40.9 to 67.2), whereas abdominal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) were frequently associated with iron or potassium products. Emergency department visits for supplement- induced swallowing problems were not common among patients 6 to 64 years of age (9.4%; 95% CI, 7.3 to 11.4) but were more common among those 65 years of age or older (37.6%; 95% CI, 29.1 to 46.2). Among older adults, 83.1% (95% CI, 73.3 to 92.9) of emergency department visits for supplement-induced swallowing problems involved micronutrients.Figure 1.

All rights reserved. n engl j med 373;16 nejm.org October 15, 2015 1537Emergency Department Visits and Dietary Supplements Trends over Time The estimated number of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events was 20,517 (95% CI, 15,187 to 31,854) annually in 2012-2013. However, after account-ing for population increases, the incidence of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events did not significantly change during this period (P = 0.09). There were no significant changes in the estimated numbers of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events associated with herbal or complementary nutritional products, micronutri-ents, weight-loss products, or energy products or for unsupervised ingestion of dietary supplements by children. However, emergency department visits for adverse events associated with micro-nutrients (excluding iron, calcium, and potassium) increased from 3212 (95% CI, 1930 to 4493) annually in 2004-2005 (95% CI, 3397 to 5759) annually in 2012-2013 (P = 0.03 after accounting for population increases). Discussion On the basis of reports from a nationally repre-sentative sample of emergency departments from 2004 through 2013, we estimated that dietary supplements were implicated in an average of 23,000 emergency department visits and 2000 hospitalizations annually. Although the numbers of emergency department visits and hospitaliza-tions were less than 5% of the numbers that have been reported for pharmaceutical products previously, 27 dietary supplements are regulated and marketed under the presumption of safety. Although the incidence of emergency depart- ment visits for adverse drug events is reported to be low among young adults, 27 more than one quarter (28%) of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events in our study involved young adults between the ages of 20 and 34 years. Weight-loss or energy products caused more than half these visits, commonly for cardiac symptoms (palpitations, chest pain, or tachycar-dia). Notably, cardiac symptoms were document-ed more frequently in emergency department visits for adverse events associated with weight loss (43%) and energy products (46%) than for prescription stimulants. In a previous study 28 that used the same data source as the one used in our study, cardiac symptoms were document-ed in 23% of emergency department visits that were associated with prescription stimulants, which have label warnings for sympathomimetic adverse effects. Unlike over-the-counter or pre-scription medications, there are no requirements to identify adverse effects on dietary-supplement packaging. Clinicians could be encouraged to educate patients about potential cardiac effects from these products. However, since dietary-supplement histories are infrequently obtained, 29-32 particularly among young adults,31 other oppor- tunities for informing users of these potential adverse effects may be needed. Unsupervised ingestions by children caused more than one fifth (21%) of all estimated emer-gency department visits for supplement-related adverse events, with almost two thirds involving micronutrients. Child-resistant packaging is not required for dietary supplements other than those containing iron, 33 and despite such pack-Figure 2.

Innovative safe - ty packaging and targeted education on safe storage are potential interventions to reduce un - supervised ingestion of supplements by children. 34 Among older adults, swallowing problems caused nearly 40% of emergency department visits for supplement-related adverse events, with micronutrients implicated in more than 80% of these visits. The FDA recommends limiting the size of pharmaceutical tablets to 22 mm and requires the reporting of tablet size and shape on abbreviated new-drug applications. 35 However, there are no size recommendations or similar reporting requirements for dietary supplements. Large amounts or multiple types of micronutri - ents are often packaged in a single large pill, and many micronutrient products approaching or exceeding 22 mm are commercially available. 36 Considerations for reducing the number of emer - gency department visits for swallowing prob - lems include decreasing the size of supplement pills or using other delivery vehicles (e.g., liquids, gels, or powders), particularly for micronutrients for older adults, along with educating patients on methods for avoiding swallowing problems. Limitations of our analysis should be noted. The number of emergency department visits at - tributed to supplement-related adverse events that we identified is probably an underestimation, since supplement use is underreported by pa - tients, and physicians may not identify adverse events associated with supplements as often as they do those associated with pharmaceuti - cals. 29-31,37 Physicians also may have more limit - ed knowledge of interactions between prescrip - tion drugs and dietary supplements than they do interactions between prescription drugs. In ad - dition, we did not collect data on emergency department visits associated with products that are generally considered to be foods or drinks by consumers but that may be considered to be dietary supplements under the Dietary Supple - ment Health and Education Act (e.g., energy drinks). However, it is also possible that emer - gency department physicians may incorrectly at - tribute certain symptoms to supplements, which could lead to overestimation. The relatively wide confidence intervals around the reported national estimates indicate the pre - cision limitations of using a relatively small, al - beit representative, sample of hospitals. Sample size and design also prevent identification of differences among metropolitan areas, states, or regions. Nonetheless, population-based active surveillance can quantify adverse events better than voluntary reporting. 10 A limited regulatory framework makes it challenging to accurately monitor the safety of supplements. 18 It was not possible to calculate rates of emergency department visits for adverse events associated with supplements according to specific ingredient, product, or type, because data quantifying supplement use are extremely SymptomEmergency Department Visits estimated % (95% CI) Supplements for weight loss Palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia 42.9 (38.4-47.4) Headache, dizziness, presyncope, or other acute sensory or motor impairment32.1 (26.2-38.0) Nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain 18.6 (13.6-23.7) Mild or moderate allergic reaction 14.3 (9.5-19.2) Anxiety 12.9 (10.2-15.5) Severe allergic reaction 4.2 (2.3-6.2) Seizure, syncope, or loss of consciousness 4.0 (2.1-5.8) Supplements for energy Palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia 46.0 (39.1-52.9) Headache, dizziness, presyncope, or other acute sensory or motor impairment34.3 (25.7-43.0) Nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain 23.0 (15.9-30.1) Anxiety 17.5 (11.4-23.7) Micronutrients Mild or moderate allergic reaction 40.6 (34.2-47.1) Pill-induced dysphagia or globus 23.6 (17.1-30.0) Airway obstruction from choking 19.4 (10.7-28.0) Headache, dizziness, presyncope, or other acute sensory or motor impairment7.0 (3.8-10.2) Nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain 6.5 (3.2-9.7) Severe allergic reaction 6.1 (3.7-8.6) Palpitations, chest pain, or tachycardia 3.8 (2.2-5.4) * Cases of unsupervised ingestion of dietary supplements by children are not listed here.

Estimates of overall supplement use are available from national surveys, but studies have used varying categorizations, and most lack product-specific data. 5,38 Identifying specific ingre - dients is also challenging because dietary supple - ments often contain multiple ingredients, and similarly named products can have different in - gredients. For example, a product called Pro Clini - cal Hydroxycut Lose Weight lists 10 active ingre - dients, none of which are the three listed active ingredients in Hydroxycut Appetite Control. 39 We categorized supplements on the basis of common reasons for use. In some cases, products were identified only by intended use (e.g., weight-lifting supplement). In other cases, specific prod - ucts or ingredients were named, but because some products and ingredients are marketed for multiple uses (e.g., to improve energy and sexual performance), patients' reasons for use might have differed from assigned categories. In conclusion, we estimate that more than 23,000 emergency department visits annually in the United States from 2004 through 2013 were for adverse events associated with dietary sup - plements. Such visits commonly involved cardio - vascular adverse effects from weight-loss or energy herbal products among young adults, un - supervised ingestion of micronutrients by chil - dren, and swallowing problems associated with micronutrients among older adults. These find - ings can help target interventions to reduce the risk of adverse events associated with the use of dietary supplements.
