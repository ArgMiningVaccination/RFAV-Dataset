As of early June, there were about 130 product types listed on FDA's drug-shortage webpage. Most of the affected products are cancer medications, anesthetics used for patients undergoing surgery, emergency medica-tions, and intravenous electrolytes. Sterile injectables dominate the list and are prime targets for shortages because of limited production lines and capacity challenges, explains the FDA webpage. The reasons given for the various shortages include everything from manufacturing delays to increased market demand to material (API) shortage to product discontinuation. FDA points out that shortage informa- tion is provided \"voluntarily by manu-facturers\" and that the agency \"cannot require firms to report the reason for shortage or duration of the shortage or any other information about shortages.\" This may soon change however. Earlier this year, FDA issued a draft guidance, Notification to FDA of Issues that May Result in a Prescription Drug or Biological Product Shortage. The guidance is meant to address growing concerns about drug shortages, which have tripled from 61 in 2005 to 178 in 2011, states the draft guid-ance. In 2011, FDA tracked over 250 drug shortages. These shortages can prevent pa-tients from getting the crucial medications they need, when they need them. In addi-tion, shortages can lead to larger problems. For example, in late May, FDA warned the public about a counterfeit version of Adderall being sold on the Internet\u2014the counterfeit version contained the incorrect API. The drug just happens to be on the shortage list due to API supply issues. Although the agency cannot do any- thing to stop drugs from being discontin-ued\u2014that is the manufacturer's choice\u2014it can do something about supply and quality problems that lead to shortages and about the way shortages are reported and tracked. A goal of the guidance is therefore to in-crease communication between industry and regulators in an effort to protect the public health. Reporting planned discon-tinuations of life-saving drug products to the authorities has been a requirement of manufacturers since about 1997 under Sec-tion 506C of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. However, the new draft guidance goes further by clarifying who has responsibil-ity for such reporting: the \"sole manufac-turer,\" defined by the draft guidance as \"the only applicant currently supplying the US market with the drug product\" where drug product includes specific strength, dosage form, and route of administra-tion. The draft guidance also redefines the term \"discontinuance\" to include \"any interruption of manufacturing of a drug product described in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(a) for sale in the United States that could lead to a potential disruption in supply of the drug product, whether the interruption is intended to be temporary or permanent.\"In October 2011, FDA reminded man- ufacturers via letter of their mandatory reporting requirement and encouraging them to voluntarily report any disruptions in supply that could lead to a product short-age. That same month, President Obama ordered FDA to \"use all available adminis-trative tools to expand the Agency's efforts to combat the problem of drug shortages.\" The new draft guidance aims to carry out that order and to further enforce Section 506C. The draft document specifically calls out certain actions that may lead to a temporary or permanent drug supply problem, such as delays in acquiring ac-tive or inactive ingredients, equipment failures, and manufacturing shutdowns, whether for maintenance or routine mat-ters. Manufacturers will need to notify FDA of these issues if they could lead to a disruption in supply. The agency also asks industry in the draft guidance to notify it on a voluntary basis (the above items would be mandatory with the final guidance) when certain problems could \"reasonably\" be expected to lead to a drug shortage or disruption (e.g., stability concerns, facility transfer, etc.) I have high hopes for the guidance. In 2010, for example, 38 shortages were pre-vented because companies notified the agency of potential problems. Just as we tell our children, it's always best to tell the truth\u2014even if it hurts a little to do so\u2014because in the end, it's simply the right thing to do. PT Comments on the FDA draft guidance were due at the end of May 2012. According to the FDA press office, 16 comments were submitted and a final guidance is expected to be issued promptly. In the meantime, companies and suppliers can send relevant shortage information to drugshortages@fda.hhs.gov.The Truth About Drug Shortages Manufacturers willing to report the bad news about supply can help reverse the shortage trend.Angie Drakulich Angie Drakulich is editorial director of Pharmaceutical Technology.

Jill Wechsler The main result of the Supreme Court decision in late June to uphold the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is that it ends all the rampant speculation and uncertainty about the future shape of the US healthcare system. Now healthcare providers, insurers, medical products makers, and government agencies can move forward with the complex process of establishing new programs and poli-cies to expand coverage to millions of Americans. Patients can expect more coverage options and improved access to care, including prescription drugs. The much-anticipated ruling produced an audible sigh of relief from the health-care industry, even those parties that would have preferred to see much of the program disappear. For biopharmaceu-tical and biotechnology companies, the decision means that FDA can continue to implement the new biosimilars pro-gram and that industry will continue to pay higher Medicaid rebates and provide discounts to Medicare patients who reach the Part D doughnut hole. In return, some 33 million more people will gain help in paying for drugs and med-ical products over the next decade through health-insurance exchanges and expanded state Medicaid programs. It is this antici-pated market increase that prompted the industry to support the Obama adminis- tration's healthcare reform initiative three years ago and agree to provide more than $80 billion in fees and rebates to support the program. Companies also have to pay hefty excise taxes, a requirement op-posed by medical-device makers, who are pushing for repeal of a $30-billion tax on their sector over the decade. The decision also will encourage more comparative ef-fectiveness research under the auspices of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which is authorized by the ACA. Yet, biopharmaceutical companies and some providers continue to press for elim-inating the Independent Payment Advi-sory Board (IPAB), which they predict will lead to price controls. At a recent seminar on biomedical innovation sponsored by the Brookings Institution, Amgen Chair-man Kevin Shearer described IPAB as \"a really bad idea\" that could derail biotech product development. Jim Greenwood, president of the Biotechnology Indus-try Organization (BIO), said that IPAB \"threatens patient access to needed cures and medical breakthroughs.\" With regard to Medicaid, although the High Court declared the individual mandate constitutional, it curbed the requirement that states expand Med-icaid eligibility or face a loss of federal Medicaid funds. The Justices supported the program expansion, but limited the penalty for states that choose not to comply. States that decide not to ex-pand eligibility would lose only the ad-ditional payments for broader coverage, and not all federal Medicaid funding. It's not clear how states will respond to this more flexible option. Even if they decide on expansion, legal experts believe that the Medicaid decision has the potential of imposing more long-term limits on the growth of federal social welfare pro-grams, and may end up having a signifi-cant impact on government initiatives and future court decisions. In addition, states face the enormous task of estab-lishing insurance exchanges, overhauling health IT systems, and implementing a host of ACA provisions. Overall, the decision to uphold the constitutionality of the ACA is a major political victory for the Obama admin-istration. In ruling that the individual mandate is a legal tax and that individu-als can decide to pay the tax instead of purchasing health insurance, Chief Jus-tice John Roberts took a step that will in-trigue legal scholars and Supreme Court experts for years. In rejecting the Com-merce Clause as the basis for expanding health coverage, though, the ruling may place significant limits on future federal government expansion. The future of healthcare in the US now depends on who controls the White House and Congress after the Novem-ber elections. Republicans have pledged to dismantle Obamacare if they win in November, and health reform will be a prime campaign issue. Reform advo-cates won a major battle, but the war over healthcare will continue. PTNo matter the upside or downside to the Affordable Care Act, there's work to be done.

In March 2012, Pfizer Japan, a subsidiary of Pfizer US, set up a Rare Disease Division with the objective of becoming a global leader in treating rare diseases. China's Beijing Genomics Insti- tute (BGI) in the Yantian District of Shenzhen, formed BGI Japan in Kobe, in September 2011, to increase its range of partners and to conduct joint research with Japanese companies. Golden Bio-technology Corporation in Taipei, Taiwan, established a Tokyo- based subsidiary in April 2011 to push out its proprietary health supplements. And the list goes on. Report from: Japan Jane Wan contin. on page for PharmTech.com 18 Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 PharmTech.comIN THE FIELD The well-established Japanese pharmaceutical market con- tinues to attract extensive foreign interest and investment. Alan Thomas, director of business planning and analytics at IMS Japan K.K., says: \"An increase in chronic disease, such as dia- betes and cardiovascular related, and the number of treated pa- tients within these diseases continues to see expanded access to pharmaceuticals. Additionally, an increase in specialty-related disease areas, such as oncology and osteoporosis, drives growth with increased use of biologics and specialty pharmaceuticals. With these emerging and expanding disease areas, the number of innovative treatment options available is also improving.\" Japan's stagnating economy and aging population have urged the government to reshape healthcare policies that favor the entry of foreign firms. The agency has taken steps to shorten the drug- approval process and facilitate easy access to better treatment op- tions. The median drug approval has fallen from 22 to 15 months in the past two years; and the approval time for products under priority review has dropped from 15 to 9 months. The government is considering \"a compassionate use\" system that allows seriously ill patients to use drugs yet to be approved for use in Japan. This program is meant for patients who have not responded to standard treatments and where domestic options are unavailable. The government is also looking to allow health insurers to shoulder some of the costs incurred by patients under this system. Japan has spent time examining the sector's clinical trials and pricing as well, and under new initiatives, the increased acceptance and use of global clinical-trial data has reduced cost and sped timelines. The so-called \"clinical triangle\" comprising of China, Korea, and Japan, also helps to reduce development time in Japan because of the additional trial data available. In addition, the extension of Japan's \"premium for development of new drugs and elimination of off-label use\" is applicable to the National Health Insurance (NHI) price revisions established in April 2010. Under this system, manufacturers are encouraged to develop new drugs and provide additional information for existing ones when prod- ucts are eligible for a lower NHI price revision. Recently, the government shifted its focus to generic drugs with the goal of increasing market share to 30% by 2013 in a bid to address to the country's overburdened healthcare system. To dis- pel the common public perception that generic drugs are inferior, generic drugs and their active ingredients are placed under rigor- ous quality control. Generic-drug manufacturers are required to supply all of the strengths and dosage forms of the branded version. The Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare (MHLW) also requires manufacturers to supply strengths of the same dos-age form as those of the branded products, and that the generic versions be a perfect match to the branded products. Ranjith Gopinathan, program manager of life sciences and healthcare practice at Frost & Sullivan, adds, \"Strongly backed by the government, the generics market is encouraged by initiatives such as relaxing registration procedures and providing incentives to doctors prescribing them over branded drugs.\"Interestingly, foreign presence has reshaped the business strate- gies of domestic players. Jamie Davies, head of pharmaceuticals and healthcare at Business Monitor International, says, \"Typically, Japanese pharmaceutical companies are conservative in nature and focus primarily on the domestic market and have limited exposure in less developed states. However, the dual effect of pat-ent expiries and reduced research productivity has forced them to increasingly look abroad for sales growth. As a result, several are looking to emerging markets to generate new growth.\" Japan's stagnating economy and aging population have urged policies that favor the entry of foreign firms. Domestic companies have started to forge strong links with international firms and foreign markets. All the leading Japanese firms derive around 40% of their revenue from overseas markets, mainly the US, although exposure to emerging markets is in- creasing, adds Davies. In October 2010, Takeda Pharmaceutical in Tokyo announced plans to form alliances with Indian compa- nies to sell its patented drugs and to offer basic business services. The M&A quest has also gained momentum in Japan with Takeda's acquisition of Nycomed, based in Zurich, Switzerland, for $13.7 billion in September 2011. Takeda Farmac\u00eautica Brasil has signed an agreement to acquire Multilab Ind\u00fastria e Com\u00e9r- cio de Produtos Farmac\u00eauticos, based in Rio Grande do Sul, Bra- zil, by the end of the second quarter of 2012. Of course, there are exceptions. Recently, Eisai, based in Tokyo, has shifted its focus back to East Asia, citing the region's enormous potential, especially now that the Japanese market is becoming attractive again thanks to government initiatives. Likewise, Sawai Pharmaceutical in Osaka is concentrating on the Japanese market and exploring partnerships with larger pharma- ceutical companies to expand its therapeutic range. Thomas adds, \"From a portfolio perspective, Japanese phar- maceutical companies will put their focus on speciality pharma, oncology, and biological platforms. This acquisition activity will gain momentum as a strategy for market entry and portfolio ex- pansion.\" Although domestic firms control 66% of the Japanese pharmaceutical market share, the market remains attractive to foreign big players for its lower risk and exposure compared with other markets. In fact, a Bloomberg source indicates that the prominent companies are doing quite well. Pfizer grew Japa-nese sales to $7.3 billion last year and GlaxoSmithKline figures were up by 28% in the same year. Large-scale companies are well- positioned due to their strong late-stage pipelines and aggressive launch objectives to continue to grow over the next two to three years. On the other hand, smaller-scale players with no presence in Japan may have to opt for out-licensing or partnering to main- tain growth.

Our supplier noted the filter was difficult to make and expe-rienced many rejects. Some filters failed during integrity testing. We were the last customer they had for this specific nanofil-ter as they had convinced their other cus-tomer to change over to a new filter. The suggested replacement for our older filter was $700. The filter was a new technol-ogy filter priced at $5000\u2014still single-use. However, we did not make the replacement filter pass qualification testing in our pro-cess. Because the supplier was insistent on canceling production, we looked at other suppliers. We finally found a filter that would fit in our process (at $3000 each). However, the integrity test required use of suspended and standardized gold par-ticles which added several thousand dollars to each use. People wonder why pharma-ceuticals cost so much, well, our costs went up a half-million dollars a year because the supplier discontinued its product.\" Caustic quality \"When your bioburden trend goes out of control, you need to take action,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place noted. \"We had a nonster-ile process in which the bioburden was increasing, and the manufacturing staff was not finding the source. The Quality team spent time on the manufacturing floor during all shifts to watch the activi-ties. While we were there, the bioburden went back to historic levels, although no new activities had been instituted. It was only when the investigation team started reviewing equipment log books that they realize that during the bioburden excur-sions, the standard operating procedure that required caustic soak of the vessels had been forgotten.\" Confusing configuration \"We had just switched from distributing our product directly from the manufactur-ing site to using a third-party logistics (3PL) partner,\" said our stunned GMP Agent-In-Place. \"Our release computer system was linked to the 3PL's computer system, which used a two-step release process. Step one involved the manufacturing site release information and step two focused on the transit temperature review. When these requirements were met, the computer sys-tem would automatically release the batch. After our usual validation testing and ap-proval, we turned the process on. Unfortu-nately, there was a bug in the configuration of the live system and some batches were released without the proper prerequisites. Luckily, we were carefully watching the system during the first couple of days from two different sites and caught the issue be-fore unreleased product was distributed. We quickly tweaked the configuration and now the system works as desired. Lesson learned: the test system isn't always com-pletely identical as the live system.\" Spring cleaning \"We had two manufacturing sites located in the same city,\" said our GMP Agent-In-Place as he began his complaint. \"The sites shared the Quality department. Also, the supplier-qualification process included testing and auditing. Both sites performed extensive remodeling, which required several automated cleaning pro-cesses, and each site had new procedures for cleaning and disinfection. The proj-ects were run by separate groups, so each picked its own new clean-in-place agents and disinfectants. Each group needed ex-tensive laboratory characterization and test development as well as numerous sup-plier audits. And each team insisted that its different equipment vendors 'required' these new and unique materials. Yes, we did get all the necessary laboratory work completed and did successfully perform the audits. But a little coordination up front would have saved several hundred-thousand dollars.\" PTMeticulous system configuration can prevent the machines from taking over your product batches.Technology Fights Back Pharmaceutical Technology's month- ly \"Agent-in-Place\" column distills true-life cautionary tales from the files of Control, a senior compli-ance officer.

The instrument has a range of 0.1-1000 ppb TOC and a resolution of +/ O.1 is measured using UV oxidation and differential conductivity detection, with results in less than two min- utes. The analyzer is designed for ease of performing a system suit- ability test (SST). Standard sucrose or benzoquinone solutions are auto- matically added, and grab samples can be taken by pushing a button. In addition, automatic sensor verifica- tion uses less expensive, durable, concentrated standards that are automatically diluted, which allows the user to verify the accuracy of the measurement without performing a SST. The analyzer's electronic drift stabilization provides long term, stable analysis results.System reduces sample preparation for mass spectrometry PerkinElmer's AxION Direct Sample Analysis (DSA) system is designed to introduce liquid, solid, and gas samples directly to PerkinElmer's AxION Time-of-Flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. The DSA system eliminates sample prepara-tion steps and removes the need for front-end gas or liquid chromatography separa-tion because samples can be directly in-troduced to the mass spectrometer. Using the DSA system reduces sample prepara-tion time from a typical 25 min. down to 25 s. The integrated DSA system is entirely enclosed to prevent atmospheric contamination of samples and fully auto-mated for fast data acquisition.

Th e bill (S. 3187) enables FDA to collect ap - proximately $6 billion in fees over th e next five years from pharmaceutical an d medical device companies. These fee s are crucial to maintaining an efficien t prescription drug regulatory system . At the same time, the Supreme Cour t upheld the constitutionality of the Af - fordable Care Act. The decision ende d speculation that FDA might lose au - thority to establish a pathway for devel - oping new biosimilars [see Roundup] . Now the hard work begins to imple - ment new policies and prepare the mul - tiple guidance documents and report s required by FDASIA. As with mos t 300-page bills, the FDA legislation ha s something for everyone: patient advo - cates gained added incentives for devel - oping crucial medicines; providers ap - plauded policies to curb drug shortages ; and manufacturers may benefit fro m speedier approvals and stiffer penaltie s for counterfeiters . The basic user-fee program for drug s and biologics hashed out by manufac -turers and FDA officials over the previ - ous 18 months remained intact durin g the legislative process. Generic-dru g makers agreed to pay almost $300 mil - lion annually to accelerate approvals , clear up an immense application back - log, and support timely inspections o f foreign manufacturers. In addition , firms developing new biosimilar s agreed to provide upfront fees to cove r some of FDA's cost in providing guid - ance to sponsors, a program expected t o raise $128 million over five years . Supply chain security As the analysts and lawyers continu e to pore over the fine print in FDASIA , some questioned whether policymaker s should have taken more time to resolv e some contentious issues, such as how t o establish a national track-and-trace sys - tem for prescription drugs. Policymak - ers were stalemated by industry's sup - port for tracking based on lot number , instead of individual vials and bottles , as FDA preferred. Manufacturers thu s face multiple state tracking require - ments, starting with a California la w that goes into effect in 2015 . Still, the final law contains a wealt h of provisions designed to help FDA de - tect and block adulterated and illega l medical products. All drug manufactur -ers and foreign suppliers have to registe r with FDA, using a unique facility iden - tifier. Importers face a number of spe - cific registration requirements, includ - ing electronic information submission . FDA can block the import of product s from manufacturers that deny access t o inspectors or fail to submit requested re - cords. FDA has also been given author - ity to detain adulterated products at th e border instead of having to send the m back to the shipper, and in some situa - tions to destroy violative imports . Manufacturers are required to notif y FDA if a drug may be stolen or counter - feited, and intentional adulteration fo r economic gain carries stiff penalties, in - cluding jail time. The consequences ar e even more serious for anyone who in - tentionally traffics in counterfeit drugs . An important change overrides th e established, but long unworkable two - year plant inspection requiremen t and permits FDA to inspect drug - manufacturing facilities on a sched - ule that reflects risk factors. Anothe r innovative provision specifies tha t meeting cGMPs requires manufactur - ers to implement quality managemen t systems and assure the quality of ra w materials. FDA may share trade se - cret information with trusted regula - tory counterparts and gains leeway to consider inspection information fro m such regulators in evaluating the ris k level of an establishment. The bill als o specifies that US law governing drug s and medical products may be applie d to extraterritorial violations, such a s economically motivated adulteratio n of products like heparin .Jill Wechsler is Pharmaceutical Technology's Washington editor, 7715 Rocton Ave., Chevy Chase, MD 20815, tel. 301.656.4634, jwechsler@advanstar.com.Import controls and risk strategies aim to promote quality and spur new drug development.

Industry also will continue paying higher Medicaid drug rebates and hefty excise taxes to the Trea-sury, along with discounts on drugs pre-scribed to Medicare patients in the \"cover-age gap\" (see PharmTech Talk, page 14). No overtime for sales reps Another important Supreme Court deci-sion for pharmaceutical companies re-jected demands from sales representatives for overtime pay. A narrow conservative majority ruled that the detailers employed by GlaxoSmithKline are not protected by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) be-cause they are \"outside salesmen\" that do not actually sell products, but provide in-formation to physicians designed to stim-ulate prescribing. The ruling is regarded as a rebuke to the Department of Labor and the Obama administration, and it is expected to halt the wave of lawsuits filed against manufacturers over recent years. But the decision may be good for sales rep-resentatives, according to some analysts, because pharmaceutical companies oth-erwise might lay off even more detailers than they already have. FDA promotes supply-chain pilot Just as Congress approved FDA user-fee legislation without any provision for establishing a national drug track-and-trace system, the agency indicated it was moving forward with a long-planned pilot to test ways to ensure the quality and integrity of imported pharmaceuti-cal ingredients and finished products. The Secure Supply Chain Pilot Program was originally proposed in 2009 but gen-erated concerns about excessive red tape and oversight. Now FDA has revised the program and is seeking final approval from the Office of Management and Budget to move forward. FDA's plan is to select up to 100 manufacturers and im-porters that each submit information on how five drugs will be imported into the US. Applicants must maintain records documenting the product's movement through their secure supply chain, meet customs requirements to guard against terrorism, and demonstrate that they comply with good importer practices proposed by FDA. Regulating apps A fairly obscure provision in the FDA Safety and Innovation Act seeks to clar-ify how FDA may\u2014or may not\u2014regulate medical applications for smart phones and other computer devices, a hot issue with manufacturers and health authori-ties. The final bill stops short of prohibit-ing FDA from finalizing a draft guidance document issued last year that proposed agency regulation of software that links to a device, but not low-risk applications such as calorie counters. Consequently, FDA officials are expected to hold off on drafting a final guidance until it forms a working group, as required by FDASIA, to quickly (in 18 months) develop a strat-egy for an \"appropriate, risk-based reg-ulatory framework\" on health IT \"that promotes innovation, protects patient safety and avoids regulatory duplica-tion.\" FDA will consult with the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology and the Federal Communi-cations Commission and include manu-facturers, payers, venture capitalists, IT vendors, patients, providers, and others in the working group. The compromise measure reflects concerns of software and medical device companies that FDA will over-regulate this budding industry, squashing inno-vation and promising health technology. There already are some 40,000 medical apps, some developed by pharmaceuti-cal manufacturers looking to enhance patient use of treatments for diabetes and other medical conditions and to help manage clinical trials. FDA regu-lates medical software that controls x-ray machines, infusion pumps, and certain implants and recently approved a medi-cal app that displays radiological images. Some software developers support FDA regulation to gain more predictability in market requirements, despite the cost and time of compliance. Biomedical innovation in trouble? The time and cost of developing new drugs are rising, venture capitalists make no return on investments in bio-pharma R&D, and other countries are boosting support in this area while US policymakers propose funding cuts for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Experts painted this bleak picture of the \"state of biomedical innovation\" at a June seminar sponsored by the Brook-ings Institution. There is a \"relentless decline\" in biopharma R&D productiv-ity, as measured by the number of new drugs approved compared with spend-ing on R&D, pointed out Jonathan Leff of Warburg Pincus. NIH Director Fran-cis Collins warned that the US faces a decline in its scientific leadership and competitiveness as visionary scientists find research funding increasingly dif-ficult to obtain. FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg cited the impact that reimbursement and immigration policy have on innovation, and that FDA strives to serve as a gateway, and not a barrier, to advancing new product development. Amgen Chairman Kevin Shearer sounded a more optimistic tone, noting that the US biotech industry continues to \"dominate the world,\" and that no other country \"is even close\" to the US in providing the financial support and scientific infrastructure for biopharma-ceutical innovation. If you develop an innovative medicine in America \"you'll be rewarded,\" he noted. The main strat-egy for the research community, said Shearer, is to continue investing in NIH, which he termed \"a national treasure,\" and to \"leave FDA officials alone.\"Hot-Topic Roundupwww.sartorius-stedim.com/platinum turning science into solutions A New Vision of Perfection. A New Class of Sterile Filtration.28 Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 PharmTech.comRegulatory Watch To curb shortages of critical drugs and biologics, the law extends report-ing requirements for manufacturers anticipating short supply situations. FDA gains clear leeway to expedite es-tablishment inspections and applica-tion reviews to help mitigate or prevent a shortage, along with requirements to issue an annual report on drug short-ages and to maintain a drug-shortage list that will help patients and provid-ers keep informed of supply problems. The Drug Enforcement Administra-tion has to provide timely approvals or denials of requests to increase quotas of controlled substances when needed to address a drug shortage. And a new Health and Human Services (HHS) task force will examine ways to en-hance the federal response to shortages and create a strategic plan to address these problems. Accepting risk This fifth version of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFAV) offers additional assistance for research spon-sors and greater transparency in the application review process to complete more first-cycle reviews. Patient advo-cates played a prominent role in press-ing for provisions to accelerate FDA approval of new treatments for serious and life-threatening conditions, along with articulation of an FDA risk-benefit framework to clarify that new drugs are never absolutely safe, and that patients accept a certain amount of risk in using new treatments. Specific provisions provide expedited review of fast-track products and clarifi-cation of evidence and endpoints to sup-port accelerated approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening conditions. Grants for developing orphan-drug prod-ucts will continue, and revised conflict-of-interest rules will make it easier to bring in knowledgeable experts to serve on advisory committees, especially those committees dealing with rare diseases. Infectious disease experts gained in- centives for developing new antibiotics: an added five years exclusivity will apply to specific \"qualified infectious disease prod-ucts,\" which FDA has to define and list. Other provisions encourage develop- ment of new formulations and expand-ing labels for drugs for children. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act were made permanent, instead of requiring reautho-rization every five years. A new pilot pro-gram will test whether an offer of priority review vouchers, which can be redeemed for a speedy FDA review of another prod-uct, will accelerate development of new therapies for rare childhood diseases. FDA may share trade secret information with trusted regulatory counterparts A less-noticed but important provi- sion requires electronic submission of applications for drugs, once FDA estab-lishes policies and standards for doing so. In this part of the bill, the legislators take the unusual step of permitting FDA guidance to set requirements, a strategy that aims to move this policy forward without a lengthy rulemaking process. And the final bill aims to reduce dupli-cative clinical studies by encouraging FDA to accept foreign clinical trial data to support new drug applications. FDASIA also makes it easier for manu- facturers to make minor modifications in risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) programs. Generic-drug mak-ers, however, lost out in their campaign to prevent brand firms from using REMS to block access to products needed to test and develop new generic competitors, an issue that could affect biosimilar development down the road. However, other changes in generic exclusivity policy and procedures for handling citizens' petitions promise to enhance access to generic drugs. Policymakers sought to add restric- tions on the prescribing and sale of opi-oid painkillers to rein in the rampant abuse of these prescription products, but pharmacists objected strenuously. So instead, FDA will hold a public meeting on the need to reschedule hydrocodone and seek ways to exchange prescribing information across state lines to help pharmacists detect multiple painkiller prescriptions. These discussion are likely to address FDA's long-awaited REMS for extended-release opioids, which was is-sued just after FDASIA was finalized. The REMS stops short of mandating education for opioid prescribers, opening the door to further debate and legislative proposals on controlling these drugs.

In a similar way, relatively inexpensive elastomers can contribute disproportionately to the cost of running a biopharmaceutical manufactur-ing operation. Elastomers and plastics play a vital role in the operation of a bioprocess-ing plant, forming gaskets, \"o\"-rings, and diaphragms deep within the structure of the processing equipment. Their function is to prevent leaks and to separate fluids that should never come into contact. These rubber-like materials are useful because they are flexible, elastic, and can ensure tight seals between hard metal surfaces. Over time, and with the harsh tem- perature, chemical, and pressure cycles that they are subjected to, these materials can become brittle and deformed and fail. They need to be exchanged well before there is a risk of failure, the consequence of which could be a contaminated product or a dangerous breach of a system. Many biopharmaceutical plants have a large in-stalled base of valves for example, maybe 5000 or more. Each one needs to be main-tained correctly to avoid problems. Al-though the cost of failure is high, the cost of exchange is also high. It is estimated that up to 50% of maintenance activity is consumed by soft parts changeout. Add this to the plant downtime, and there is a clear target for cost-saving scrutiny. So, what scope is there for improvement? Can current practice be challenged? The currently accepted and common approach for elastomer changeout is temporal based (i.e., there is a fixed fre-quency, perhaps annually or biannually, for scheduled maintenance to replace the component). Although this approach is acceptable, it does not take into account the conditions that the elastomer has been subjected to. In cases where the component has been lightly used, it may be exchanged even though continued use would be per-fectly acceptable. At the opposite end of the spectrum, severe use could risk failure of the elastomer before its fixed time period had been reached. Several engineering leaders in biophar- maceutical operations are questioning this methodology. They are being driven by the unrelenting quest for operational excellence and more effective ways of working. As well as cost savings, there is the realization that their talented engineers could be better deployed working on high value-adding technical projects rather than routine maintenance. One such engineer got into the habit of collecting discarded soft parts from changeovers and visually inspecting them. His curiosity and dislike of waste led him to ask whether there was a better way to systemize the replacement of these items so that they were used for longer but without risking failure in opera-tion. His involvement in a cross-industry benchmarking group and discussions with his like-minded peers showed that better practices did exist. This knowledge spurred him to implement a new way of working, leading to significant cost savings. By following simple scientific and risk-based approaches, some companies are now extending the life of elastomers by three, four, or five times. The previ-ous time-based maintenance cycles have been replaced with condition-based cycles whereby the wear and tear on the compo-nents are carefully analyzed and graded so that the life of the components can be accu- rately predicted. The factors affecting wear and tear, such as the numbers of cleaning cycles, temperatures and chemicals used, are recorded to provide a rational basis for analysis and later, measurement. Operational data showing variations from predicted results are further sources of insight, shedding light on unknown fac-tors that lead to variability reduction and greater confidence levels predicting com-ponent condition. One such root-cause analysis revealed that correct or incorrect assembly of diaphragm valves can contrib-ute significantly to performance of the soft parts. Correct lubrication of fixing bolts and accurate torque setting for instance was discovered to be a contributory factor in the life of diaphragms. The question of conformance to speci- fication was another target-rich area with lack of clear standards and nonexistent or inconsistent industry wide test methods. Elastomer suppliers have a long way to go to meet the exacting needs of the biophar-maceutical environment. Performance has historically been the customer problem. Lack of control around changes being a particular concern where the supply chain of suppliers and suppliers' suppliers is not rigorously managed. The same industry best-practice shar- ing group is now advancing the cause by proposing customer-centric standards covering generic-test sequences, visual in-spection criteria, and better change control. With agreement by the various stakehold-ers, these standards will be written into globally recognized codes that set the scene for better industry compliance. In this example of a drive for best prac- tice in biopharmaceutical manufacturing, one can trace a direct line from one engi-neer examining the disassembled parts of a butterfly valve to a new industry system of standards and quality performance levels previously not experienced.

Today, faster and more sensitive quality-control equipment provides con-tinuous online vigilance. Data-collection capabilities are more robust too, which increases automation of record-keeping and validation. Vendors also are provid-ing tools to help match quality-control systems to applications. Quality-control machines, introduced in the past year or so, are indicative of the technology avail-able today and include systems for visual inspection, leak detection/seal integrity confirmation, checkweighing, and con-taminant detection. Visual-inspection systems Visual-inspection systems, such as vision sensors, smart cameras, and camera-based vision systems, confirm the pres-ence and position of caps, lids, and labels and check for particulates, label accuracy, and surface imperfections. For the most demanding applications, full-scale machine-vision systems pro-vide the highest level of programming flexibility. Although machine-vision systems are still the most complex to set up and configure, software and operator interfaces streamline configuration and simplify operation. In the mid-range of functionality and ease of use, smart cameras combine a cam-era with onboard intelligence and an array of software tools that offer considerable flexibility for application programming. The simplest and easiest to implement system, the vision sensor, also combines a camera with onboard intelligence and is optimized for optical-inspection tasks. A vision sensor can be taught to compare a captured image to a good sample and/or check for specific defects. Its capabilities are sufficient for many packaging-line in-spection tasks (1). Software is designed to be intuitive even for users who are not vision experts, said Jim Anderson, product manager for ma-chine vision at SICK, in a company publi-cation (1) (vision sensors, smart cameras, vision systems, SICK). For pharmaceutical packaging appli- cations, one robot-supported inspection machine handles almost any cylindrical container with a volume between 1 mL and 100 mL, including vials, syringes, am-puls, cartridges, cylindrical blow-fill-seal containers, and inhalers. The six-axis robot arm moves up to 15 containers per minute through three machine-vision inspection stations equipped with different camera, lighting, and container positioning options. In some cases, more than one inspection is performed at a single station. The system can check for the following: particles from a bottom or side view; proper cap applica-tion; dirt or cracks at the shoulder of the container; scratches, cracks, or chips on the neck, shoulder, or sidewall; cracks at the heel; flaws on the bottom of the con-tainer or heavy particles in suspension; and particle or cosmetic defects. The compact system is compatible with isolator enclo-sures and particularly well-suited for toxic or highly potent products (Seidenader RIM inspector with robot arm from St\u00e4ubli Group, K\u00f6rber Medipack). Another multiple-camera, machine- vision system examines tablets from six angles to confirm surface quality. Laser-slit lighting and three-dimensional images im-prove identification of chips and emboss-ing flaws, while color cameras and filters detect subtle color variations. Simulation modes shorten set-up time, and fewer, lighter change parts reduce changeover time. The system runs up to about 5800 tablets per min (Viswill TVIS-EX3-CD visual inspection system for tablets, Daiichi Jitsugyo America). A print quality inspection and barcode verifier for thermal and thermal-transfer printed labels performs a variety of in-spections. Functions include master-to-label comparison (i.e., blemish detection), one- and two-dimensional barcode veri-fication and validation, optical character recognition, optical character verification, field matching, and number/data valida-tion. Additionally, the software includes automatic setup for quick label and field identification, job retrieval for recall of pre-vious runs, and a robust alarm matrix for user-defined input/output interaction with peripheral devices.

The system is 21 CFR Part 11 compliant- ready, offering multiple security levels and comprehensive data management and re-porting options (LVS 7500 inspection sys-tem, Label Vision Systems). Leak detection/seal integrity high-speed, vacuum-based system pro-vides 100% inspection of prefilled syringes for leaks at up to 600 syringes per min. The patented system positions the syringe so its entire surface can be checked without al-tering the position of the stopper or affect-ing the product. (Wilcomat R 36 MC/LFC high-speed leak tester, Wilco AG). An inspection system based on infra- red technology confirms seal integrity in flexible packaging and between thermo-formed trays and lidstock (see Figure 1 ). A high-definition infrared camera captures an image of each seal immediately after sealing. Software analyzes the image, de-tects any abnormality in the seal, and re-jects leakers. The equipment also monitors sealer function and can provide an alert if maintenance is needed (infrared seal in-spector, Qipack BVBA). High-voltage integrity and locates pinholes, microcracks, and other defects as small as 1 micron. Seamless migration to production-scale systems simplifies testing leak system, PTI Inspection Systems). Checkweighing Checkweighing improves product qual-ity, meets regulatory requirements, and reduces production costs, according to a downloadable guide that helps drug pack-agers establish a checkweighing program and covers checkweigher design features, equipment accuracy and statistical process control (2). The document also defines op-erating goals, total cost of ownership, and metrological regulations and guidelines while supporting installation, verification, and limit setting to maximize efficiency and minimize costs ( Principles of Check- weighing Guide , Mettler-Toledo Hi-Speed). A family of mid-range, servo-driven checkweighers measures up to 7500 g at 250 per min and features a touch-screen operator interface, a 100-recipe memory, four password-protected user levels, vali-dation support, and an extended event log. Product transport belt changes require no tools, and a variety of reject devices are offered. High ground clearance simplifies cleaning (HC-M-WD washdown OCS Checkweighers). Contaminant detection Today's metal detectors can locate smaller metal fragments. One system detects ferrous fragments as small as 0.25 mm with a 95 \u00d7 22 mm head. The machine is capable of checking up to 30,000 solid dosage forms per min and successfully locating metal fragments in difficult-to-inspect liquid gels or iron-containing tab-lets by filtering out the signal emitted by the product itself. A slightly less sensitive 95 \u00d7 38 mm head also is available (Insight PH pharmaceutical metal detector, Lock Inspection Systems). Contaminant-detection systems with X-ray technology can \"see\" a wide range of foreign objects. One family of advanced X-ray detectors offers mixed product and multilane inspection and count, seal, and weight confirmation. Other features in-clude toolless disassembly for cleaning, compact 60-in overall length, low-profile design, and auto-learn mode for easy setup. One model is shown in Figure 2 (E-Z Tec XR-Pack X-Ray detector, Eriez). One of the latest models checks upright packages and containers from the side with a side-shoot beam rather than the up-shoot beam that is standard in other models in the group (E-Z Tec XR-SS X-ray detector, Eriez). Another X-ray system detects sub- visual foreign particles in lyo cakes and suspensions in vials, ampuls, or syringes with a substantially lower false reject rate than traditional camera-based inspec-tion systems. Detectable particle sizes include 20 microns for metal, 50 microns for glass and 90-100 microns for plastic or rubber. Capable of checking 200-400 products per min, the inline or stand-alone X-ray system can be integrated with modules devoted to headspace analysis and near infrared-based lyo cake moisture detection. Bubbles, which can be problematic for some inspection sys-tems, are virtually invisible to the X-ray beam, which also can confirm proper needle alignment and check for missing stopper material or splintered glass, de-fects that would ordinarily be concealed by the crimp cap (Wilcomat X-Ray par-ticle detector, Wilco AG).

Discussions of the statistical implications of Q8 and Q9 have appeared since theguidelines were harmonized (4). Little has been said, however, about the statistical content of the Q10 model, prob-ably because it is perceived to be focused only on the management of the quality system. There are many Q10 recommen-dations that affect statistical issues facing the pharmaceutical industry, however, the guideline states that it is not \"intended to create any new expectations beyond cur-rent regulatory requirements\" (1). Although no new statistics or sampling plans are explicitly required by Q10, it goes without saying that current regulatory re-quirements are, in fact, mandatory. In ad-dition, cGMPs continue to improve over time and according to Q10, \"Implementa-tion of ICH Q10 throughout the product lifecycle should facilitate innovation and continual improvement and strengthen the link between pharmaceutical devel-opment and manufacturing activities\" (1). That link should include the results of statistically designed experiments and related statistical and risk analysis. While not explicitly requesting these approaches, ICH clearly implies that companies need to be proactive when it comes to corrective and preventive ac-tion (CAPA) programs. In today's envi-ronment, it is not sufficient to be reactive alone when problems occur. The Quality department must routinely seek out po-tential problems and prevent them before they result in rejects or recalls. For exam-ple, Q10 notes that companies should \"Es-tablish and Maintain a State of Control. To develop and use effective monitoring and control systems for process perfor-mance and product quality, thereby pro-viding assurance of continued suitability and capability of processes\" (1). Having control over one's product and process is not a new expectation, al-though there is still confusion as to what a proper \"state of control\" means (4). It is not enough to ask for a state of control; the industry must provide and define addi-tional modifiers. There are several ways in which a process can be in a state of control or, conversely, in a \"state of out of control.\" A process can be in control, for in- stance, for financial and accounting, for regulatory compliance, and for organi-zational and managerial control. These forms of control are usually assumed to be in place. There are two other states of control that are germane to statistics: engineering and statistical. A process is said to be in a state of en- gineering control when the process can be changed and adjusted using control knobs and/or by setting the critical pro-cess parameters (independent variables) that affect the dependent responses (5). When in control, the product always meets its specifications even if inconsis-tent and erratic. Time plots with speci-fication lines are used to monitor the process. A process is said to be out of engineering control when it fails to meet its specifications. A process is said to be in a state of statistical control when the process has been designed, developed, and adjusted to produce product that, while still con-taining some variability in the critical quality attributes (dependent variables), is predictable in that variability over time. Statistical control charts are used to monitor the process. A process is said to be out of statistical control when it fails one or more of the eight West-ern Electric control chart rules (6). As Q10 notes, \"The pharmaceutical quality system should include the following ele-ments, process performance and prod-uct quality monitoring, corrective and preventive action, change management, and management review\" (1). Product quality monitoring can be interpreted as trending the critical qual-ity attributes. Again, proactive CAPA is preferred to reactive CAPA. As Q10 high-lights: \"Advocate continual improvement\" (1). This continual improvement should include proactive variability reduction. Also recommended in Q10 is: \"... a written agreement between the con-tract giver and contract acceptor.\" This agreement should include the acceptable Applying the recommendations of ICH Q10 to statistical analysis can help prevent product recalls.Lynn D. TorbeckA Statistical Review of ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System Lynn D. Torbeck is a statistician PharmStat Consulting,2000 Dempster, tel. quality limit (AQL) and limited quan- tity (LQ) limits for incoming sampling plans as well as the usual specification methods and acceptance criteria. Data collected in-coming and in-process can be used to determine compliance with a contract agreement. Per Q10, \"Through-out the product lifecycle, companies are encouraged to evaluate opportunities for innovative approached to improve prod-uct quality\" (1). There are many ways, statistically, to achieve this goal. Trending, designed experiments, variability reduction, and design space are just some of the tools that can be used to make process im-provements. Many of the terms in ICH Q10 imply trending of critical parameters and at-tributes. It is a given that this must be done. Q10 states: \"An effective moni-toring system provides assurance of the continued capability of processes and controls to produce a product of desired quality and to identify areas for continual improvement\" (1). Process capability is measured by comparing the variability of the prod-uct/process to the width of the specifi-cation range. This comparison can best be achieved using statistical tolerance intervals because they take into account the sample size where Cpk and Ppk do not. Per Q10, \"Identify sources of varia- tion affecting process performance and product quality for potential continual improvement activity to reduce or con-trol variation\" (1). Some Six Sigma programs have got- ten a poor reputation in certain circles because of a single-minded focus on saving money as opposed to giving equal consideration to improving qual-ity and reducing variation. It is the au-thor's opinion that management needs to give equal attention and resources to both. As Q10 calls for, \"Proposed changes should be evaluated by expert teams contributing the appropriate ex-pertise and knowledge from relevant areas (e.g., Pharmaceutical Develop-ment, Manufacturing, Quality, Regu-latory Affairs and Medical), to ensure the change is technically justified\" (1). The company's statistics department or a statistician should be included in the team. Many statements in ICH Q10 have im- portant implications for the correct and consistent use of statistics in the day-to-day implementation of pharmaceutical quality systems. Addressing these har-monized recommendations proactively and in context can help to strengthen one's quality system and thereby reduce rejects and recalls. References and notes 1.

That is the best way to sum up the manufacturing investment activity of the pharma- ceutical majors during the past year. Com-panies continue to implement restructur-ing programs as a way to reduce costs and optimize their manufacturing and supply networks. Investment, when it is made, is primarily in biologic-based manufacturing and emerging markets, with a few select projects proceeding in established product and geographic markets. Company investment Pfizer: Pfizer continues with plans to re- structure its manufacturing network fol-lowing its $68-billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009. Following the acquisition, Pfizer's manufacturing sites totaled 81, and other acquisitions added 20 manufacturing sites. Pfizer subsequently exited nine sites and operated 90 plants as of the end of 2011, with major manufacturing facilities in Belgium, China, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Philippines, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and the United States. It plans to exit a fur-ther 10 sites during the next several years. After the acquisition of Wyeth in 2009, Pfizer operated 20 R&D sites and has re-structured its R&D operations, which in-volved several site closures, including its R&D facility in Sandwich, United King-dom, except for a small presence there. In 2011, Pfizer rationalized several other R&D sites. It disposed of its toxicology site in Catania, Italy; exited its R&D sites in Ab-erdeen and Gosport, UK; and disposed of a vacant site in St. Louis, Missouri. Pfizer also shifted its cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine disease and neuroscience research units from its site in Groton, Connecticut, to Cambridge, Massachu-setts, where it signed a lease with the Mas- sachusetts Institute of Technology, with occupancy anticipated in early 2014. In 2011, Pfizer opened Centers for Therapeu-tic Innovation laboratories in Boston, New York, and South San Francisco. Novartis . In 2010, Novartis initiated a company-wide program to review its man-ufacturing footprint, which progressed in 2011, with major goals to create manufac-turing centers of excellence, reduce its cost structure, and enhance utilization rates at strategic sites to 80% of capacity. To these ends, the company has announced the exit or partial exit of 14 sites since the program started in 2010. In Liverpool, UK, and Marburg, Germany, Novartis discontin-ued certain manufacturing activities to consolidate its influenza-vaccine platforms. Novartis also divested the pharmaceuticals division's sites in Casablanca, Morocco, and Huningue, France, and Sandoz (the generic-drug business of Novartis) sites in Jena, Germany, and Buenos Aires, Ar-gentina. The company also discontinued pharmaceuticals manufacturing at sites in Tlalpan, Mexico, and Horsham, UK, and exited CIBA Vision production sites in Cidra, Puerto Rico, and Farnham, UK. Additionally, the company announced the discontinuation of certain manufacturing activities at its CIBA Vision site in Atlanta, Georgia, and the consolidation of phar-maceutical chemical operations in Swit-zerland, as well as closure of its chemical operations in Torre, Italy. Novartis continues to make prog- ress in the long-term redevelopment of its St. Johann headquarters site in Basel, Switzerland. This project, called \"Campus,\" started in 2001 with the aim of transforming the site from one of primarily pharmaceutical produc-tion into a center of knowledge with a primary emphasis on international corporate functions and research ac-tivities. Through Dec. 31, 2011, the total amount paid and committed to be paid on the Campus Project was $2.1 billion. The company expects that through 2015, it will spend more than $2.5 billion and transfer production fa-cilities to other sites in the Basel region. Novartis continues to expand in emerg- ing markets. In June 2011, Novartis began Measuring Growth in Big Pharma's Manufacturing Investment BURAZIN/PHOTOGRAPHER'S CHOICE RF/GETTY IMAGES Cover Story: Manufacturing Investment Patricia Van Arnum Pharmaceutical Technology's annual manufacturing investment update shows slight gains in biopharmaceutical manufacturing and emerging markets and continued restructuring of supply networks.Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 39construction on a new $140-million man- ufacturing plant for pharmaceuticals and generic drugs in St. Petersburg, Russia. The plant is expected to produce approximately 1.5 billion units per year (oral solid dosage forms). In China, in 2007, Novartis opened a start-up facility for a new R&D center in Shanghai, China, and broke ground in 2008 on Phase 1 of a new facility that was originally to be home to approximately 400 R&D scientists and approximately 400 other pharmaceuticals division per-sonnel. In 2009, it expanded the scope of the site with plans to invest $1 billion dur-ing the next five years to increase the size of its operations in Shanghai. Based on a re-evaluation of the site conducted in 2010, the current Phase 1 has been extended by two buildings. The cross-divisional Shang-hai campus will house 800 offices and 400 laboratory workplaces. In October 2010, Novartis announced plans to invest $600 million during the next five years to build new laboratory and office space for research activities in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 2011, the company finalized design plans for the new buildings, received necessary zoning changes from the city of Cambridge, and began preparing the site for construction. In late 2010, Novartis began a construction project on the campus of Novartis in East Hanover, New Jersey, which will continue through 2013. The company expects that through 2013, it will spend more than $545 million to complete the construction and consolidate operations there. In other recent investments, in June 2008, Novartis broke ground on a new $330-million rabies and tick-borne enceph-alitis manufacturing facility in Marburg, Germany. Construction is complete, and the facility is in the process of executing the necessary validation activities. Regu-latory approvals for products are planned for 2012 and 2013. In November 2009, Novartis opened a new cell culture-based influenza vaccine manufacturing site in Holly Springs, North Carolina. As of De-cember 31, 2011, the total amount spent on the project was $463 million, net of grants reimbursed by the US government. The total investment in this new facility is expected to be at least $900 million, partly supported by grants from the US govern-ment and prior investments in influenza cell- culture technologies at the Novartis vaccines site in Marburg, Germany. Novar-tis also began a project for a new $305-mil-lion vaccine-manufacturing facility in Re-cife, Brazil, with technical start-up of the facility planned for 2015. In 2011, Novartis' eye-care business, Alcon, completed the construction of a new $134-million man-ufacturing and R&D plant in Singapore; the plant is scheduled to produce saleable product after regulatory approval in 2012. Novartis said it is making progress for resolving quality-control issues at its con-sumer healthcare operations in Lincoln, Nebraska, and at three facilities of Sandoz. In December 2011, Novartis suspended production at is Lincoln manufacturing site in conjunction with a voluntary recall of all lots of select, bottle-packaged con-figurations of certain over-the-counter products. In December 2011, FDA cited quality-control issues at three Sandoz manufacturing facilities in Broomfield, Colorado; Wilson, North Carolina; and Boucherville, Canada. In an Apr. 24, 2012, first-quarter earnings release, Novartis said that it is making progress in remediating the quality issues at the Lincoln site and the three Sandoz production sites. Merck .

Source : The Pharm Exec 50, Pharmaceutical Executive, May 2012.40 Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 PharmTech.comary 2010, subsequent to the Merck and Schering-Plough merger, Merck began a global restructuring program in conjunc-tion with the integration of the two com-panies. In July 2011, the Merck announced the latest phase of the restructuring pro-gram, which included a further reduction of its workforce of 12-13% company world-wide. A majority of the workforce reduc-tions in this phase relate to manufacturing (including animal health), administrative, and headquarters organizations. Previ-ously announced workforce reductions of of 17% in the earlier phases of the program primarily reflected the elimination of po-sitions in sales, administrative and head-quarters organizations, as well as from the sale or closure of certain manufacturing and R&D sites and the consolidation of office facilities. Sanofi. Sanofi's subsidiary Genzyme began production of the enzyme- replacement therapy Fabrazyme (agalsidase beta) at its new facility in Framingham, Massachusetts, following approval of the fa-cility by FDA and EMA in January 2012. In May 2012, EMA and FDA approved a sec-ond operation for fill-finish at Genyzme's Waterford, Ireland, manufacturing plant, which nearly doubled capacity for fill- finish for Myozyme and Lumizyme (al-glucosidase alfa) at the 4000-L scale. These developments follow a 2010 consent decree issued by FDA to Genzyme for manufac-turing violations at its Allston, Massachu-setts, facility and resulting requirements to transfer fill-finish production out of that facility. Other investments by Genzyme include expansion of Myozyme produc-tion capacity in Geel, Belgium, Fabrazyme in Framingham, Massachusetts, Thymo-globulin (anti-thymocyte globulin (rabbit)) in Lyon, France, and the filling operations in Waterford, Ireland. Other recent investments by Sanofi are in two new Lantus production lines in Frankfurt, which complemented an earlier acquisition of the Diabel manufacturing site from Pfizer, to expand insulin produc-tion. Sanofi invested in its Brindisi, Italy, site to expand production of spiramycin, the API in the antibiotic Rovamcyin. The company also is investing in the launch of epiCard, a gas-powdered single-dose, single-use, auto-injector for epinephrine. Sanofi is continuing with its Biolaunch project, which is designed to converts its chemical facilities to biotechnology-based production. It is on track to create a monoclonal antibody production facility at its site in Vitry-sur-Seine, France, and is investing in new biosynthetic processes as its sites in Saint-Aubin-Les Elbeuf and Ver-taolaye, France. In May 2009, Sanofi began construction of a new EUR 300 million ($364 million) manufacturing center in Neuville-dur Sa\u00f4ne, with the the goal to progressively transition existing chemical production to vaccine production begin-ning in 2013. Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine arm of Sanofi, is scheduled to begin com-mercial production of a new antigen pro-duction unit in Mexico for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines in 2012, once the necessary production and marketing approvals have been obtained from Mexi-can regulatory authorities. In emerging markets, in May 2012, Sanofi inaugurated a new assembling and packaging line for producing its prefilled insulin injection pen Lantus SoloStar at its facility in Beijing.

The company reached an agreement with the King Abdulah Eco-nomic City to build a manufacturing facil-ity for solid-dosage forms in Saudi Arabia. Roche . In 2011, Roche executed 25 major engineering projects. Key proj-ects included transforming its manu-facturing facility for solid dosage forms in Shanghai from a local to a global supply operation. In early 2011, the fa-cility received FDA and EMA approv-als to produce Xeloda (capecitabine )for the US and EU markets. In June 2011, Roche completed a CHF 191-million ($193 million) ex-pansion at it facility in Penzberg, Ger-many, which upgraded and expanded the site's therapeutic protein develop-ment and production capacity. In No-vember 2011, Roche completed con-struction of a new CHF 250 million ($252 million) technical R&D facil-ity in Basel, Swizterland. The facility houses laboratories, offices, and small-scale production lines. In late 2010, Roche divested technical development and small-molecule manufacturing operations in Boulder, Colorado, to Corden Pharma. Corden will continue to supply Roche with commercial-scale peptides and chemical APIs. Roche also sold its clinical plant in Oceanside, California to Gilead Sciences. GlaxoSmithKline. In March 2012, SmithKline (GSK) announced plans to invest more than \u00a3500 million ($798 million) in the UK across its manufacturing sites, which included selecting Ulverston in Cumbria as the location for the first new GSK manu-facturing facility to be built in the UK in almost 40 years. The company also will invest in sites in Montrose and Ir-vine, Scotland. GSK's announcement followed plans by the UK government to implement a \"patent box\" to encourage investment in R&D and related manufacturing in the UK by intro-ducing a lower rate of corporation tax on profits generated from UK-owned intellec-tual property. Following a feasibility study conducted through 2011, GSK said it will locate a new \u00a3350 million ($559 million) biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Ulverston, Cumbria. Detailed planning and design of the new facility is underway with an anticipated start date for construc-tion of 2014-2015, dependent on portfolio timing and obtaining necessary planning and related consents. Once construction starts, it is likely to take at least six years before the plant is fully operational. GSK also reported in March 2012 that it is considering additional manufactur-ing investment at Ulverston, which could double the total investment at the site to approximately \u00a3700 million ($1.1 billion). GSK will invest more than \u00a3100 million ($160 million) in its two manufacturing sites in Scotland: an expansion at Mon-trose for key materials for its respiratory drug and aluminum adjuvants for vac-cines and expanded antibiotic production capacity at Irvine. GSK will also invest in sustainable green-energy production and environmentally friendly manufacturing technologies at both sites. The company is making other investments totaling \u00a380 million ($128 million) at its sites in Ware in Hertfordshire to increase manufactur-ing capacity for its respiratory-inhalation device and at Barnard Castle in County Durham to establish a dermatology-man-ufacturing center of excellence. As GSK proceeds with new manufac- turing investment, it continues to restruc-ture. In 2011, GSK met its original target of \u00a32.2 billion ($3.4 billion) in annual cost-savings and identified additional annual savings of approximately \u00a3600 million ($931 million), bringing expected total an-nual savings of \u00a32.8 billion ($4.3 billion) by 2014. GSK has cut its pharmaceutical R&D footprint by more than 45% during the past three years from 494,000 m 2 to 295,000 m2. During the same period, its manufacturing organization has achieved annual savings of approximately \u00a3600 million ($931 mil-lion) . Since 2006, GSK has exited 19 manu-facturing sites, including selling or closing four factories in 2011, thereby reducing its total number of manufacturing sites to 74. AstraZeneca . In February 2012, Astra- Zeneca announced new restructuring initiatives aimed at delivering annual cost-savings of $1.6 billion by the end of 2014. The restructuring will reduce head-count by 7300. The job cuts include 1350 positions in supply-chain and manufac-turing operations and 2220 positions in R&D, including ending R&D activity at sites in Sodertalje, Sweden, and Montreal. Overall, AstraZeneca's capital ex- penditures on supply and manufac-turing facilities were $388 million in 2011 (2010: $333 mil-lion; 2009: $360 million). At the end of 2011, approximately 9600 people at 23 sites in 16 countries were work-ing on the manufacturing and supply of products. In October 2011, Astra-Zeneca announced an investment of $200 million to build a manufacturing facility in China Medical City in Tai-zhou, Jiangsu province, China, to meet growing local demand. Bristol-Myers Squibb . In May 2012, FDA approved Bristol-Myers Squibb's biologics manufacturing facility in Devens, Mas-sachusetts, for commercial the company's arthritis drug Orencia (abatacept). The $750-million multiprod-uct bulk biologics manufacturing facility in Devens represented the largest capital project in the company's history.

What factors come into play when deciding whether to produce the amorphous solid disper-sions through HME or spray drying? Bend Research: Both spray drying and HME can be used to pro- duce amorphous dispersions that enhance the bioavailability of poorly soluble compounds. There are a number of factors that come into play when deciding to progress an amorphous disper-sion. These include performance, projected dose, stability, and manufacturability. When choosing which technology to employ for optimizing the amorphous dispersion formulation's perfor-mance, two key factors are: the physical-chemical properties of the API and the phase of development, which influences the amount of API available for formulation development. Important physical-chemical properties include the solubil- ity of the API in either a solvent (for spray drying) or polymer (for HME), the melting temperature of the API, and the LogP value of the API. For spray drying, the solubility of the API in the solvent is crucial to ensure a readily scalable and viable process, whereas for HME, the solubility of the API in the poly-mer is crucial to ensure a thermodynamically stable system. The particle size of the API, which influences the dissolution rate during processing, can also be crucial for complete dissolution into the polymer melt. The processing temperature is important for HME be- cause the API must either melt to form a dispersion or dissolve through high shear forces into the molten polymer. If the pro- cessing temperature is too high, the compound or the polymer used in the formulation can degrade. Typically, 200 \u00b0C to 225 \u00b0C is regarded as the upper processing-temperature limit for an effective HME process. Although compounds can be extruded at higher processing temperatures, this physical situation often produces a partially crystalline formulation instead of an amor-phous dispersion. The phase of development is also an important factor in pro- cess selection. For example, for early-stage or discovery-support activities, API availability is often limited. This limited API avail-ability tends to make spray drying the preferable process because its feasibility can be determined with as little as 50 to 100 mg of API, whereas several grams of API are typically required to de-velop an initial HME process. For APIs that are amenable to HME, typically after proof-of-concept clinical studies, when hundreds of grams of API are available, an initial spray-drying process can be converted from spray drying to HME. Advantages and disadvantages of each technique PharmTech: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using HME compared with spray drying to produce the amorphous solid dispersion? Bend Research: HME has two primary advantages. First, no solvents are used, so solvent cost and recovery are not a factor in cost-of-goods or environmental health and safety considerations. Second, the equipment footprint for HME is relatively small when the process is scaled up. The primary disadvantage of HME is that the compound must be melted or dissolved in molten polymer at high temperatures. Thus, it is less applicable to compounds with higher melting temperatures or those that are thermally la-bile. This disadvantage can be partially remedied by includ-ing nonvolatile and volatile plasticizers in the formulation, which lower the temperatures required to produce an amor-phous dispersion. Because an ideal amorphous dispersion is homogeneous at the molecular level, a second disadvantage is that the homogeneity of the final dispersion can be af-fected by process parameters such as temperature, screw configuration, screw speed, and feed rates; this aspect, com-bined with the relatively large minimum batch size, results in cost and risk during early development.Bioavailability Enhancement: When to Use Hot-Melt Extrusion versus Spray Drying A Q&A with Bend Research Enhancing bioavailability can be achieved through hot-melt extrusion (HME) or spray drying. The drug product's API properties and stage of development are important factors to consider when deciding which technique to use. The re are also considerations to be made with regard to process, time, and cost. To gain perspective on these issues as well as insight into more recent advances in HME and spray drying, Pharmaceutical Technology spoke to Bend Research, an independent drug-formu lation development and manufacturing company based in Bend, Oregon.Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 45PharmTech: What are the advantages/ disadvantages of using spray drying compared with HME to the amorphous solid dispersion? Bend Research: Spray drying offers the following advantages: it is applicable to a broader chemical space for the API and types of dispersion polymers that can be used (due to dissolution of the API in a vol-atile organic solvent); it does not expose the API to excessive heat during manufacture of the amorphous dispersion; and it can be scaled down, requiring smaller quantities of API during formulation screening. Spray drying has a few disadvantages as well: solvents are used and must be re-covered, equipment footprints are larger, and capital and operating costs are higher. These considerations must be taken into account when designing later-stage or com-mercial processes and facilities, but they are not insurmountable\u2014as evidenced by successful operation of Hovione's PSD-4 and PSD-5 spray-drying facilities and the fact that spray drying is used extensively outside of the pharmaceutical industry at large scales. Achieving desired bioavailability PharmTech: Can you be specific in terms of achieving desired bioavailability/solubility of the resulting product, stability of the re-sulting product, the ease and/or scalability of the manufacturing process, and other process conditions that are important in deciding which approach to use? Bend Research: As mentioned previously, both spray drying and HME can be used effectively to manufacture amorphous dispersions. A formulation produced by either process would be expected to yield similar bioavailability and physical stability as long as both processes yield a homogeneous amorphous dispersion with appropriate final-powder particle size, which generally requires milling for HME. If either of the processes fails to produce a homogeneous amorphous dispersion, the resulting formulation will likely underperform. This situation is most common when a compound fails to completely dissolve during the HME process due to either the high melting temperature of the compound, or the low solubility of the compound in the molten polymer, resulting in crystallization or phase separation when the melt cools. Spray drying and HME are readily scaled. Commercial-scale equipment is available at many pharmaceutical orga-nizations and several contract research organizations. Recent advances PharmTech: On an industry level, can you highlight recent advances in HME with respect to improvements in the manufac-turing process and its application to differ-ent types of APIs? Bend Research: HME is a technology that has been widely used in pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical industries for de-cades. Recent advances in HME include ef-forts to reduce processing temperatures by including plasticizers and reduce the resi-dence time of the compound and polymer during processing. Numerous research groups are looking at nonvolatile plasticiz-ers, such as vitamin E or triethyl citrate, to reduce processing temperatures. Others have reported the use of volatile excipi-ents, such as supercritical carbon dioxide, to avoid decreases in the final dispersion's glass-transition temperature that occur with traditional plasticizers. There have also been recent reports of the use of equipment that has significantly reduced residence time. Professor Mc-Ginity's research group at the University of Texas has developed a process called Kinetisol to make amorphous dispersions. It is based on equipment that was devel-oped to recycle plastics, which can reduce the residence time of the API and polymer at processing temperatures from minutes to tens of seconds. PharmTech: Can you highlight recent indus- try advances in spray drying with respect to improvements in the manufacturing process and its application to different types of APIs? Bend Research: Although spray drying is a well-established process, innovations in formulation approaches and process equipment are occurring. In formula-tion, there is an increasing need for a third component in the dispersions to help de-liver challenging compounds aimed at novel biological targets. Often, a surfac-tant is added to help increase the dissolu- tion rate or dispersion-particle wetting or to provide an alternate micelle source to enhance drug solubility in vivo. Equipment advances include novel spray-dryer and cyclone designs to collect the dispersion particles more efficiently. This is especially significant for particle-en-gineering applications such as inhalation, which requires the manufacture and col-lection of particles with a narrow particle- size distribution for delivery to the lung. As part of the effort to formulate com- pounds with low solubility in organic sol-vents, Bend Research has developed a \"hot process,\" which allows a drug suspension to be heated to high temperatures\u2014often well above the ambient-pressure boiling point of the solvent\u2014in a heat exchanger to dissolve the drug immediately before it is introduced into the spray dryer. This de-creases solvent use and can result in a more scalable process. PharmTech: One specific technology of Bend Research is the spray-dried nanoadsorbate technology. Can you explain this technol-ogy and how it differs from conventional spray drying? Bend Research: Two physical situations are dose-limiting when formulating amor-phous dispersions: low dissolution rates for compounds that are highly lipophilic and recrystallization for compounds that have high melting temperatures. To formulate highly lipophilic compounds, we have developed the spray-dried nanoadsorbate technology as an extension of spray-dried dispersions. This technology is based on spray drying an amorphous dispersion onto a high-surface-area inorganic sup-port such as Cab-O-Sil (fumed silica). The increased surface area promotes faster dissolution of the dispersion and is par-ticularly well suited for highly lipophilic compounds (e.g., compounds that have LogP values greater than 6 to 7). Simi-larly, to formulate compounds with high melting temperatures, we have developed a technology that is based on intention-ally recrystallizing the compounds in the dispersion polymer in nanometer-sized domains. This formulation type also is a high-energy form of the API that contains a concentration-enhancing polymer. PT46 Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 PharmTech.com Pharma Ingredients: APIs & Excipients Process chemists face the challenge of developing cost-effective and ef-ficient commercial manufacturing routes for APIs. They encounter the challenges of increasing product yield, achieving greater stereoselectivity and regioselectivity, and improving process conditions, such as temperature and pressure, all in a means to produce a high-quality pharmaceutical com-pound in a safe manner. A variety of tools may be used in this effort, includ-ing the application of green-chemistry approaches, such as biocatalysis, sol-vent replacement, and continuous-flow chemistry, to help achieve more effi-cient chemical transformations under improved reaction conditions. Biocatalytic route to simvastatin In June 2012, Codexis, a company specializing in biocatalysis, and Yi Tang, professor in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineer-ing at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), were awarded the \"2012 Greener Synthetic Pathways Award\" as part of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards for developing a biocatalytic route for mak-ing simvastatin, the active ingredient in Merck & Co.'s anticholesterol drug Zocor, which is now off patent (1). Co-dexis and Tang won the award this year after having made prior submissions of the new process in 2010 and 2011 (2-4). For the simvastatin route, Codexis licensed technology from Tang. The previous synthetic routes to simvastatin involved converting lovastatin into sim-vastatin by adding a methyl group that required protecting and then deprotect-ing other functionalities in the lovastatin molecule in a multistep synthesis. In the first route, lovastatin was hydrolyzed to the triol, monacolin J, dimethyl butyryl chloride, and deprotection. The second route involved protecting the carboxylic acid and alcohol functionalities, methylating the C2' car-bon with methyl iodide, and deprotecting the product. These routes were inefficient because they produced less than 70% overall yield and were mass-intensive due to protection and deprotection (1-4). DON BISHOP/BRAND X PICTURES/GETTY IMAGESApproaches center on ways to optimize process conditions and operability. Scaling Up API Syntheses Patricia Van Arnum is executive editor of Pharmaceutical Technology, 485 Route One South, Bldg F, First Floor, Iselin, NJ 08830tel. 732.346.3072, pvanarnum@advanstar.com. The route developed by Tang and his group circumvented protection and de-protection and resulted in greater atom economy, reduced waste, and overall less hazardous reaction conditions. First, they cloned LovD, a natural acyltransferase produced by Aspergillus terreus that is involved in synthesizing lovastatin and that can accept nonnatural acyl donors. Recognizing that LovD might be a type of simvastatin synthase and a starting point for creating a new biocatalytic process, they evolved the enzyme to-ward commercial utility (1-5). Codexis licensed Tang's technology, engineered the enzyme further, and optimized the simvastatin manufacture. The biocatalyst LovD selectively transferred the 2-methylbutyryl side chain to the C8 alcohol of monacolin J sodium or ammonium salt. The acyl donor, dimethylbutyryl- S-methyl- mercaptopropionate (DMB-SMMP), is efficient for the LovD-catalyzed reaction, is safer than traditional al-ternatives, and is prepared in a single step from inexpensive precursors, according to the awards summary report (1). Codexis licensed this pro-cess from UCLA and subsequently optimized the enzyme and the chemi-cal process for commercial manu-facture. Codexis carried out nine iterations of in vitro evolution, creat- ing 216 libraries and screening 61,779 variants to develop a LovD variant with improved activity, in-process stability, and tolerance to product inhibition (1). The approximately 1000-fold improved enzyme and the new process pushed the reaction to com-pletion at high substrate loading and minimized the amounts of acyl donor and of solvents for extraction and product separation. In the new route, lovastatin is hydrolyzed and converted to the water-soluble ammonium salt of monacolin J (1-5). As specified in the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards summary report, the genetically evolved variant of LovD acyltransferase from Escherichia coli uses DMB-SMMP as the acyl donor to make the water-insoluble ammonium salt of simvastatin. The only coproduct of simvastatin synthesis is methyl 3-mercap-topropionic acid, which is recycled. The Patricia Van ArnumIncreasing challenges require better an swers.

It avoids the use of several hazardous chemicals, including tert-butyl dimethyl silane chloride, methyl iodide, and n-butyl lithium. More than 10 metric tons of simvastatin have been manufac-tured using this new process (1). Biocatalytic route to atorvastatin Pfizer also employed a more environ-mentally approach in developing a bio-catalytic route to making atorvastatin, the active ingredient of Lipitor and sub-mitted the process as an entry for con-sideration to the EPA's Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards (1). The new process incorporated a water-based 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) enzyme at the beginning of the route to make a lactol from an amino al-dehyde (i.e., 3-phthalimidopropionalde-hyde; PPA) and acetaldehyde (1). The synthesis eliminated the use of cya- nide or azide moieties to introduce nitro-gen because it is already present in the lac-tol. In contrast to the original synthesis, the DERA enzyme set both stereocenters with high selectivity in water at room tempera- ture. the resulting into isopropyl deprotection, Paal Knorr). The IAA product was isolated as a solid, and IAA was converted to ator-vastatin (1). The new synthesis eliminated the previous high-pressure hydrogenation step with its associated metal catalysts. It also avoided pyrophoric n-butyl lithium and its associated butane waste gas. FDA approved the new manufacturing process in April 2010, and Pfizer manufactured commercial-scale validation batches in 2011 and is currently transitioning to full-scale commercial manufacture, according to the EPA's Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards report (1). Eli Lilly's Grignard chemistry The Grignard reaction is a well- established reaction in organic chem-istry but it poses some challenges in scaling up to commercial scale: strongly exothermic activation and re-action steps; heterogeneous reactions with potential problems suspending An ongoing challenge for scientists involved in drug development is to develop methods that allow them to identify drugs of clinical efficacy with minimal side effects. A team of researchers at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and Sea Change Pharmaceuticals, a start-up company from UCSF and the QB3 California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, recently developed a new set of computer models to help researchers identify drug candidates that are most likely to have adverse side effects. The models enable a computational approach to drug-safety assessments. Specifically, the researchers used a computational approach to predict the activity of 656 marketed drugs on 73 unintended so-called side-effect targets (1). They evaluated which of the 656 drugs were most likely to bind to 73 target proteins that appear on Novartis' safety panel for testing drugs fo r side effects, according to June 11, 2012, UCSF press materials (2). The computer model identified 1241 possible side-effect targets for the 656 drugs, of which 348 were confirmed by the Novartis proprietary database of drug interactions and another 151 were hits for other side effects that had not been previously identified for these drugs but which were later confirmed with additional laboratory testing (2). Overall, approximately half of the predictions were confirmed, either from proprietary databases unknown to the method or by new experimental assays. The researchers developed an association metric to prioritize new off-targets that explained side effects better than any known target of a given drug, thereby creating a drug-target-adverse drug reaction network (1). This computational approach for identifying drug interact ions is important to identify drugs of greater risk and eliminate them in the drug-development process and also provides the potential of developing new indications or uses of existing drugs (2).

Eli Lilly developed safer Grignard chemistry using a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) that allows con-tinuous formation of Grignard reagents with continuous coupling and quench-ing operations, a process in which the company submitted an entry to the 2012 EPA Presidential Green Chemis-try Challenge Awards (1). According to the entry, the CSTR approach mitigated hazards by operating at a small reaction volumes, performed metal activation only once for each campaign, and used 2-methyltetrahydrofuran as a Grignard reagent and reaction solvent, resulting in products with enhanced chemo- and stereoselectivity. Relative to batch pro-cessing, the continuous approach al-lowed steady-state control and overall reductions to 10% in Grignard reagent stoichiometry, and 30% in process intensity (1). Improved solvents for making diaryl aldimines Imines are intermediates used in many pharmaceutical syntheses. Diaryl al-dimines, for example, are used in the synthesis of the anticancer drug Taxol (paclitaxel) and the re-quire hazardous solvents and include energy-intensive, multihour reflux steps. Although some imine syntheses use more benign solvents or conditions, they still require long reaction times, recrystallization, or other environ-mentally harsher procedures. Jacque-line Bennett, professor in the Depart-ment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, State University of New York (SUNY) Oneonta and the SUNY Research Foun-dation, developed a process that used ethyl L-lactate as a solvent to synthe- size imines. The process was submitted as an entry to the 2012 US EPA's Presi-dential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards (1). According to the awards summary report, the method was efficient under ambient condi-tions, required less solvent than other methods, had a median yield of more than 92%, and had a me-d i a n r e a c t i o n t i m e o f l e s s t h a n 10 min (1). The resulting imines were generally sufficiently pure without re-crystallization as the polarity of ethyl L-lactate was modulated by adding water. The starting materials remained dissolved, but the imine crystallized out of solution as it formed (1). Although traditional methods often drive reac-tions forward by removing water, this method drove the reaction forward by removing the product through crystal-lization, according to the summary re-port (1). Bennett and her research team have synthesized nearly 200 imines using this method and filed a US pat-ent for the process (1, 6). Ethylene in fine-chemical synthesis Another interesting entry to the US EPA's Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards involved the use of ethylene in fine-chemical synthesis developed by T. V. RajanBabu, profes-sor in the Department of Chemistry, Ohio State University (1). According to the awards summary report, prac-tical methods using carbon feedstock sources as starting materials to form enantioselective carbon-carbon bonds are not common. A broadly applicable reaction using ethylene to install vinyl groups enantiomerically, as developed by RajanBabu, could have significant impact in fine-chemical synthesis. RajanBabu and his team devel- oped highly catalytic (substrate-cata-lyst ratio up to 7,412:1) protocols for nearly quantitative (isolated yields of more than 99% and highly selective (approximately 100% regioselectiv-ity; enantiomeric ratios of more than 99:1) codimerization various functionalized vinylarenes, 1,3-dienes, and strained alkenes.

These reactions consume both starting materials, leaving no side products. Suc-cesses include highly enantioselective syntheses of common NSAIDs, such naproxen, flurbiprofen, fenoprofen, from sty-renes and (1). Cyclic and acyclic 1,3-dienes also underwent efficient enantioselec-tive addition of ethylene. Syntheses of several 1-vinylcycloalkenes and 1-substituted-1,3-butadienes achieved yields up to 99% (1). The approach has also been applied to other biologically relevant classes of compounds, including Chemicals, intermediates, and reagents as well as byproducts of synthetic processes can have toxic properties and be present as impurities at low levels in an API or final drug formulation. The detection and re-moval of these impurities are of crucial im-portance to process chemists, particularly in the case of genotoxic impurities. One of the potentially genotoxic impurities based on structural alerts is acrolein, an , -unsaturated aldehyde that is used as a building block in the production of phar-maceuticals (7). Researchers at MIP Technologies, a subsidiary of Biotage, and the Uni-versit\u00e4t Dortmund in Germany re-cently reported on an approach for se-lective removal of acrolein from APIs using iodixanol as a model API. The acrolein scavenging performance of polystyrene- and silica- based aldehyde scavengers in organic media in the pres-ence of the API iodixanol was tested. Sev-eral scavengers were tested, and the resins that the showed highest binding efficiency and selectivity were further evaluated. The most effective and selective scavenging was obtained with polystryene-amine, which removed up to 97.8% of acrolein and only 2.0% of iodixanol within 20 min using a batch-mode extraction procedure (7).

PT Improving protein purification th rough high-performance membranes As pharmaceutical companies intensif y their product-development efforts in biologic-based drugs, strategies to improve upstream and downstream processing are crucial. Researchers at Michigan State University (MSU) recently developed new high-performance membranes to facilitate protein purification. The researchers were trying to resolve some of the challenges in column-based affinity separations by using porous membranes but waned to mi tigate the problem of low binding capacities comparative to traditional columns (1). \"The membrane devices that we've manufactured can simplify protein purification by rapidly capturing the desired protein as it flows through membrane pores,\" said Merlin Bruening, in an Apr. 30, 2012, MSU press release, who has patented the process and is working to scale up his invention. \"Our membranes have two to three times more capacity than existing commercial devices, and they should reduce the purification process time substantially. Typically, our procedures are complete in 30 minutes or less.\" Bruening and his team were trying to grow extended polymer chains in the membranes in a multistep, ox ygen-free process. In doing so, they found that direct adsorption of acidic polymers at low pH was much simpler yet accomplished the same task of creating extended polymer in the pores, according to the MSU release, as the pu rification used adsorption to attract contaminants to the surface rather t han absorption. \"Once our findings began steering us toward the simpler solution, we began developing simple processes to modify membranes by simply flowing polymer solutions through the membranes,\" Bruening said in the MSU press release. Specifically, the researchers found that layer-by-layer polyelectrolyte adsorption was a simple, conven ient method for introducing ion- exchange sites in porous membranes. The researchers showed that adsorption of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA)-containing films at pH of 3 rather than pH of 5 increased th e protein-binding capacity of such polyelectrolyte-modified membranes three- to six-fold (1). The low adsorption pH generated a high density of COOH groups that functioned as either ion-exchange sites or points for covalent immobilization of metal-ion complexes that selectively bind tagged proteins. Derivatization of the free COOH groups by reaction with aminobutyl nitrilotriacetate (NTA) yielded metal ion complexes that selectively bound tagged proteins. Although modification with polyelectrolyte films occurred by simply passing polyelectrolyte solu tions through the membrane for as low as 5 min, with low-pH deposition, the protein-binding capacities of such membranes were as high as for membranes modified with polymer brushes and two to three-fold higher than for commercially available immobilized metal affinity chromatography resins (1). The researchers concluded that polyelectrolyte adsorption at low pH is much simpler than growth of polymer brushes in membra nes, and the binding capacities that result from the two modification methods are similar. They reported that derivatization of PAA/polyethyleniminePAA-modified membranes with NTA-Ni 2+ complexes yields materials that selectively capture His-tagged protein with > 90% recovery (1).

Accepted: March 12, 2012. TOC-LCPH, SHIMADZUCleaning Methods The challenges of conducting cleaning validation are doc- umented in the literature. R. Baffi et al., for example, described the diverse analytical challenges arising in validating cleaning procedures for biopharmaceutical products produced by recombinant DNA, in which a broad range of potential residual cellular components and trace lev-els of detergents must be quantified (1). M.A. Strege et al. described the total organic carbon (TOC) analysis of swab samples for cleaning validation of bioprocess fermentation equipment and discussed accuracy, limits of detection, limit of quantitation, linearity, and precision (2). K.M. Jenkins et al. compared the advantages and disadvantages of multiple meth-ods for cleaning et al. described the TOC method for measuring residual aspirin on aluminum, stainless steel, painted carbon steel, and Plexiglas (4). The latter two authors describe the swab challenge as noted in the FDA guide to inspections of cleaning surfaces. For cleaning validation using a TOC analyzer, the follow- ing types of sampling methods are available: t\u0001rinse sampling t\u0001swab sampling with aqueous extraction t\u0001swab sampling with direct combustion. These methods were compared using a total organic car- bon analyzer (TOC-LCPH, Shimadzu) to measure residual pharmaceutical products and their constituent substances. Preparation of residue samples Residue samples were prepared by applying various types of pharmaceutical products and their constituents to stainless steel pots. Compounds with varying levels of water solubility (i.e., soluble, insoluble, and very insoluble) were evaluated to determine how each method performed. The water-soluble substances were dissolved in water and the water-insoluble substances were dissolved in ethanol or acetone, as shown in Table I . Solution concentrations were adjusted to 2,000 mgC/L (i.e., carbon concentration of 2000 mg/L). Carbon Measurement Methods for Cleaning Validation Comparing Direct Combustion with Rinse and Swab Sampling Methods. Robert Clifford and Minako Tanka Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 53ALL FIGURES ARE COURTESY OF THE AUTHORSThe carbon contents of (C17H18N2O6) estimated by molecular formula. Car- bon contents of Gentashin ointment (aminoglycoside antibiotic) and Rinderon ointment (corticosteroid) were determined with the TOC analyzer by adding samples of the ointments directly into a solid-sample combustion unit (SSM-5000A, Shimadzu) since molecular formula for these compounds are unknown. Each residue sample consisted of a 5-cm 2 area on the surface of a pot to which 100 L of each solution was applied and dried. Thus, there were 200 g carbon in the sample at each application site. Rinse-sampling method In rinse sampling, the final rinse water from the cleaning of a production-equipment unit is used as the TOC mea-surement sample. This method is suitable for systems that cannot easily be disassembled, such as clean-in-place (CIP) equipment and narrow tubing. Sampling is considered to be difficult if the residues are not soluble in water. To evaluate recovery of the various substances using this method, 100 mL of pure water was stirred for 15 min in the stainless steel pot that contained a patch of dried sample. TOC measurement was conducted on the rinse solution using a TOC analyzer (TOC-LCPH, Shimadzu) with a high-sensitivity catalyst. The analysis TOC was by acidify and sparge method. The calibration curve was a 2-point curve using 0-3 mgC/L potassium hydrogen phthalate aqueous solution. A 500-L injection volume was used. Because the carbon content in each of the residue measurement samples was 200 g, the theoretical TOC concentration (i.e., if all carbon were to dissolve in rinse water) would be 2 mgC/L. Figure 1 shows the measured TOC concentrations for rep- resentatives of water-soluble samples isopropylantipyrine), and wa-ter-insoluble ointments (c, Gentashin ointment). The other samples (i.e., anhydrous caffeine, nifedipine, and Rinderon ointment) have similar profiles to the samples with corre-sponding solubility. For the blank, measurement was conducted in the same way using water in a stainless steel pot without dried sample applied to its surface. The measured blank concentration was subtracted from each TOC concentration and divided by the theoretical value of 2 mgC/L (i.e., the theoretical con-centration if all of the sample were to dissolve in the water) to determine the rate of recovery, as shown in Equation 1 . Eq. 1 Recovery Rate (%) =TOCSubstance - TOCBlank \u00d7100 ( )TOCTheoretical All samples were run in triplicate, and the coefficient of variation values (CV) are shown in Table II along with the TOC concentrations and the recovery rates.Table I: Substances used for residue measurements.

More-over, water-insoluble isopropylantipyrine and nifedipine had high recovery rates. However, recovery rates of Gentashin ointment and Rinderon ointment were both low, at less than 20%. Consequently, the TOC rinse method, while acceptable for some substances, is unsuitable for ointments and other similar substances. Swab-sampling with water-extraction method Swab sampling with water extraction consists of wiping the inside surface of the production apparatus with a fibrous swab material, extracting the adhering material with water, and conducting TOC measurement of the extract solution. Since the residue is physically wiped off from a fixed area of the surface, sampling efficiency is high. Residues that are insoluble in water, however, are difficult to extract with water. Accordingly, evaluating water-insoluble residues with this method may present similar difficulties to the rinse-sampling method. To evaluate the recovery of the various substances using swab sampling with water extraction, the sample applied to the stainless-steel pot was wiped off with a 5-cm 2 piece of fibrous swab material, which was placed in a glass jar containing 100 mL of pure water. The fibrous swab material (Texwipe Alpha 10 swab washed in pure water and dried) consists of polyester so that very little organic material is extracted from the swab itself. The residue was extracted by stirring for 1 h, and TOC measurement was conducted using the same equipment and conditions used for the rinse-sam-pling method. Three replicates of each sample were run. As in the rinse-sampling method, because the carbon content in each of the residue measurement samples is 200 g, the TOC concentration (i.e., theoretical TOC) in the extraction solution would be 2 mgC/L if all of the sample were wiped off. Representative data are shown in Figure 2 . For the blank, measurement was conducted in the same way by wiping the stainless pot, which had no sample applied before conduct-ing extraction. Recovery rate was determined using Equation 1. The results are shown in Table III . Water-soluble tranexamic acid and anhydrous caffeine had high recovery rates as expected. Moreover, water-in-soluble isopropylantipyrine and nifedipine had high recov-ery rates of approximately 90%. However, recovery rates of Gentashin ointment and Rinderon ointment were both low, at less than 10%. These results show that the TOC water-extraction rinse method is reliable and accurate for some substances, but unsuitable for ointments and perhaps other such substances due to the low recovery rates. Swab-sampling with direct-combustion method Swab sampling with direct combustion consists of wiping the inside surface of the production apparatus with a piece of quartz filter-paper swab material, and then conducting measurement using a direct-combustion carbon-measure-ment system. The swab material with adhering residue is measured directly (i.e., without first extracting with water) in a TOC analyzer using a connected solid-sample combus-tion unit or module (SSM). To evaluate the rate of recovery of the different types of substances using this method, paper swab material (45-mm diameter Advantec quartz glass paper QR-100, heat treated at 600 \u00b0C for 15 min) was used to wipe the sample adher-ing to the stainless steel pot and placed in the sample boat, which is then placed in the SSM (SSM-5000A, Shimadzu) Table III: Measurements using swab sampling with water extraction.

Three replicates of each sample were run. The SSM uses 400 mL/min oxygen as a carrier gas. The calibration curve is a 1-point calibration using 1% C glucose aqueous solution. The total carbon (TC) content on the swab was measured directly by the TOC analyzer. Selected measurement data are shown in Figure 3 . Since the carbon content in each of the residue measure- ment samples is 200 g, the TC value would be 200 g if all of the sample were wiped off. For the blank, measurement was conducted in the same way by wiping the stainless pot, which had no sample applied. The measured blank value was subtracted from each TC value, and then divided by the theoretical value of 200 g using Equation 1 to determine the rate of recovery. The results are shown in Table IV . A high recovery rate of about 100% was obtained for all the sub-stances, regardless of whether they were water soluble or water insoluble. Conclusion The measurement methods used here and their respective recovery rates are summarized in Table V . When using the rinse- and swab-sampling methods, some of the water-insoluble substances had high recovery rates while others had low recovery rates. It is thought that this may be due to differences in the affinity with which the substances adhere to the stainless steel pot. Accordingly, it is possible that resi-due evaluation using these methods would be difficult for substances with low recovery rates. In contrast, high recovery rates were obtained for all the substances when using the swab sampling with direct-com-bustion method, regardless of whether the substances were water soluble or water insoluble. Therefore, this method is considered to be the most versatile measurement method for conducting cleaning validation, especially when mul-tiple compounds are being manufactured in the same vat, if the compounds are unknown, or if there is a possibility the known compounds will decompose into other compounds.

A working group of the consortium aims to develop a set of recommendations that can help the industry identify opportunities to improve lead time to first-in-human studies and reduce development costs while maintaining required quality standards and ensuring patient safety.

Position Paper: Early Phase GMPs The International Consortium on Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development (IQ) formed in 2010, and is an association of more than 25 pharmaceutical and biotech-nology companies with a mission to advance science-based and scientifically driven standards and regulations for medicinal products worldwide. In the June 2012 issue of P harmaceutical Technology , a paper written by the IQ Consortium's GMPs in Early Development Working Group described the desire and rationale for more clear and consolidated recommendations for GMPs in early development (Phase 1 through Phase 2a) (1). A consequence of the absence of clarity surrounding early phase GMP guidances has been varied interpretation and application of existing GMP guidances within different companies according to its own culture and risk tolerance. Internal debates often result in conservative \"one-size-fits-all\" interpretations that rely on International Confer-ence on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines that are mostly relevant to commercial product development and do not distinguish differ-ences in requirements between early development and later stage development (Phase 2b and beyond). A key driver of this working group (WG), therefore, has been to collectively define the mini-mum acceptable practices within the industry regarding GMP expectations in early development that allow for added flexibility, are consistent with existing guidance and statutes, and which as-sure product quality and patient safety (2-4). The second paper in this series addressed recommendations for analytical method validation of both drug substances (DS) and drug products (DP) (5). In this third article of the series, the authors address the application of GMPs in early development as they pertain to drug-product manufacturing. Background As noted previously in the introduction to the paper series, due to high attrition in early development, most companies try to mini-mize the resource required to advance compounds into human clinical trials by employing simple formulations and manufac-turing processes (1). For example, drug substance filled in bottle, Early Development GMPs for Drug-Product Manufacturing of Small Molecules An Industry Perspective (Part III) Richard Creekmore, Eleni Dokou, Amnon Eylath, Dennis Joiner, Michael Lovdahl, Jackson Pellett, Eric Schmitt, and John W. SkougPharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 57drug in capsule, or simple powder blends filled in capsule are fre- quently used. Even for more challenging molecules, for example, those with low aqueous solubility, prototype formulations designed to investigate bioavailability enhancement (e.g., amorphous solid dispersions, lipid-based drug delivery systems, nanosuspensions) are evaluated in as simple a manner as possible. For example, on-site preparation at the clinic site of an amorphous solid dispersion by weighing into a capsule, or by suspension in a suitable vehicle may be utilized instead of a finished tablet or capsule dosage form. Whatever approach to formulation/process is taken, there is a need for flexibility in manufacturing due to limited product and process understanding in early development. Based on the collective industry experience of the members of this working group, the authors believe that pharmaceutical companies could be making better use of available guidances as they pertain to drug-product manufacturing in early development. This belief was reflected by the mixed responses to a survey of IQ member companies conducted in late 2011 (see Table I ). Accord- ingly, in this article, the authors provide pragmatic recommen-dations related to GMP drug-product manufacturing focusing on those areas where it is believed there is opportunity for added clarity and flexibility, without added risk to product quality and patient safety. Following a brief explanation of the role and importance of quality systems, the areas highlighted in this paper include facili-ties, equipment, materials (receipt and approval for use), and batch documentation. Not covered is cleaning verification/validation, as this is a topic that is addressed in detail in the industry (6). The scope of this position paper has purposely been limited to tradi- tional small molecules that are formulated into solid oral dosage forms intended for US regulatory filings with the desire to build consistency across all worldwide regulatory regions. However, it is believed that the concepts presented can be easily adapted to other dosage forms and routes of administration. Although designed as an industry position, it is recognized that each company needs to evaluate these recommendations for drug-product manufactur-ing practices based on individual business needs and risk culture. Quality systems GMP quality system. In early development, relationships between ma- terial attributes, process parameters and product quality attributes are typically not well understood. It should be anticipated that even during GMP manufacture, there will likely be a need to deviate from the process conditions specified in a batch record. Quality systems should have the flexibility to allow these changes to be documented in batch records without formal prior approval from the Quality department. However, these changes should be re-viewed by Quality after production, to assess the potential impact to product quality and patient safety. It is crucial to summarize and track process changes because much of this information will be used to develop process understanding and may be included in development history reports. In a similar manner, unplanned deviations from the written manufacturing procedures should be documented and justified, but may not need to be addressed in a formal corrective and preventive action (CAPA) system, because the process is changing continuously as part of the development Table I.

Unplanned deviations that are likely to impact product quality and patient safety, such as cleaning failures, contamina-tions, and certain equipment failures must be investigated and corrective actions put in place to prevent recurrence. Risk management in early development. To assist in the application of risk-based decision making in the development and manufac-turing of drug product, the authors recommend that companies apply a scientific and risk-based approach, similar in principle to that of the ICH Q9 Quality Risk Management guideline (7). Annex I of the guideline describes various methods and tools that can be useful to determine the relative risks related to system risks, such as facility and people; organizations (including quality systems); pro-cess risks and product risks (safety and efficacy). There are many ways of identifying, qualifying, and mitigating operational and quality risks. Regardless of the methodology used, a documented strategy and good records of risk-based decisions are important in ensuring that the appropriate factors are considered for the protec-tion of patients and product quality. Facilities and equipment Regardless of the scale of manufacturing, the facility used for manufacturing clinical trial supplies must meet the basic GMP requirements as described in the regulations and guidance docu-ments. Below are three scenarios for early development and the advantages of each as pertaining to early development. The first involves a pilot plant facility designed and equipped for routine GMP operations. The second scenario aims to establish a GMP area within a laboratory environment. The third example focuses on conducting GMP manufacturing or leveraging the practice of pharmacy in close proximity to the clinical site. GMP facility for drug-product manufacture. The traditional ap- proach in GMP drug-product manufacture is to use a dedicated facility (often called a pilot plant) for early phase clinical trials. Advantages of this approach include that the quality systems for the facility (i.e., maintenance, calibration, cleaning, change management, CAPA, and documentation) are well defined, and that training and other activities required for maintaining GMP compliance are centralized. Other drivers to use a pilot plant in early development may be the need for specialized equipment, or larger batch sizes in special situations. GMP area within a laboratory setting. In some cases, it may be ad- vantageous to establish a GMP area within a \"laboratory setting\" (i.e., a drug-development facility not dedicated to the produc-tion of clinical supplies) for the manufacture of drug product in early development. The rationale for this approach might be to avoid the significant investment in setting up a dedicated facil-ity and to create simpler, more flexible systems that meet GMP requirements but are tailored for the specific activity envisioned. Examples where this approach might be considered include the need for special containment not available in the pilot-plant; the need to work with radioactive or hazardous materials, use of con-trolled substances and the production of \"one-off manufactured\" product used for proof of concept. The business rationale should be documented and approved by the manufacturing and Quality groups. As long as the appropriate GMP controls are maintained, especially as related to operator safety, cleaning, and prevention of cross-contamination, there is no compliance barrier to using \"lab-type\" facilities for the manufacturing of early phase clinical batches. Before GMP manufacturing is initiated, however, a risk assessment should be conducted and documented. Inclusion of representatives from Quality, analytical, clinical manufacturing, product development, and environmental health and safety would be prudent. When selecting/designing an early development clini-cal manufacturing facility, consideration should be made for the receipt, storage, dispensing, and movement of materials. The manufacturing processes in the nondedicated area must protect the product, patient, and the manufacturing operators. Additionally, companies should consider what items are ap- propriate for the manufacture. For example, the use of a certified laminar flow hood may be a better choice for manufacturing than a fume hood, because the former is designed to prevent contami-nation of the product, protect the operator, and the laboratory en-vironment. In addition, with the appropriate cleaning, a laminar flow hood can more easily be used for multiple products. Small scale/manual equipment or procedures may be the best approach because the space is likely to be limited. With a small batch size, the use of small scale or manual equipment/procedures will minimize yield loss. Additional measures to be assessed include appropri-ate gowning and operator personal protection devices, area and operator monitoring for potent or radiolabeled drug exposure, and so forth. Documentation of the facility preparation, product manu- facture, and the return of the facility to the previous state, if needed, is recommended. This documentation should describe the rationale for the manufacture in the nondedicated area, risk assessment, preparation of the area, cleaning procedures, and list of responsible persons. This documentation can reference exist-ing procedures or standard operating procedures (SOPs) along with documents associated with the meetings and preparation for the manufacture of the batch. Batch records and cleaning records should be part of the documentation and should follow the company's data-retention policy. Preparation at the clinical site. On-site preparation of formulations, sometimes referred to as \"extemporaneous preparation\" or \"com-pounding,\" is not considered manufacturing, but is an effective method to prepare early clinical supplies using the local laws gov-erning the practice of pharmacy. The processes used for on-site preparation can be as simple as preparing and diluting solutions or filling capsules with API to more complicated processes such as blending and compression of tablets. An IQ working group addressing current practices in extemporaneous preparation has conducted a survey to be communicated at a later date, which con-firms that only a few companies have adopted practices to take advantage of more advanced formulation approaches at the clinic site (8). This is a missed opportunity, because on-site preparation of formulations has the potential to dramatically speed industry's ability to answer critical questions related to pharmacokinetic pa-rameters, absolute or relative bioavailability, feasibility of extended release and bioavailability enhancement approaches for difficult to deliver molecules. Currently, each company must develop its own Position Paper: Early Phase GMPsPharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 59best practices to assure product quality and patient safety; often, these practices are based on compendial or professional associa-tion publications (9-11). The authors believe this topic warrants further discussion between the industry and regulatory authori-ties to determine when dose preparation at the clinical site is ap-propriate and the level of quality controls required. The results of such a discussion could help to increase the utilization of on-site preparation of clinical trial materials to facilitate quick answers to critical questions in early drug development and ultimately bring the best possible products to patients in the shortest time. Equipment. Most equipment used to manufacture early GMP drug product is be managed under a qualification, preventive maintenance, and calibration program for the GMP facility. However, in early development, there may occasionally be a need to use equipment that is not part of such a program. Rather than performing a comprehensive qualification for a piece of equipment not expected to be frequently used, an organization may choose to qualify it for a single step or campaign. Documentation from an installation qualification/operational qualification (IQ/OQ) and or performance verification at the proposed operating condition is sufficient. For example, if solution preparation needs a mixer with a rotation speed of 75 rpm, then documentation in the batch record using a calibrated tachometer to verify that the mixer was operating at 75 rpm will suffice. The use of dedicated or disposable equipment or product contact parts may be preferable to following standard cleaning procedures to ensure equipment is clean and acceptable for use. However, not all equipment or equipment parts are disposable or may have a substantial cost that makes disposal prohibitive. In that case, the product contact parts could be dedicated to a specific drug substance for use in drug product manufacture. Dedicating product contact parts to a compound may be costly and may be avoided in some cases by carefully considering product changeover and effective cleaning methods when purchasing equipment. Another item to consider with respect to equipment, is that the more complicated the equipment is to run or maintain, the less desirable it might be for early GMP batches. In most cases, simple equipment is adequate and will uses less material and consume less total time for preparation, operation, and cleaning activities. Raw materials Buildings and facilities. GMPs under the 21 Code of Federal Regula- tions (CFR) Part 211.42 state that buildings or areas used in the receiving, storage, and handling of raw materials should be of suit-able size, construction and location to allow for the proper clean-ing, maintenance, and operation (7). The common theme for this section of CFR Parts 210 and 211 is the prevention of errors and contamination. In principle, the requirements for buildings and facilities used in early phase manufacturing are not significantly different than those for later phases or even commercial produc-tion. However, there are some areas that are unique to early clinical trial manufacturing. Control of materials. The CFR regulations under Part 211.80 pro- vide good direction with respect to lot identification, inventory, re-ceipt, storage, and destruction of materials (7). The clear intent is to ensure patient safety by establishing controls that prevent errors or cross-contamination and ensure traceability of components from receipt through clinical use. In general, the requirements for the control of materials are identical across all phases of development, so it is important to consider these requirements when designing a GMP facility within a laboratory setting. For example, all materials must be assigned a unique lot number and have proper labeling. An inventory system must provide for tracking each lot of each component with a record for each use. Upon receipt, each lot should be visually examined for appropriate labeling and for evidence of tampering or contamination. Materi-als should be placed into quarantine or in the approved area or reject area with proper labeling to identify the material and prevent mix-ups with other materials in the storage area. Provision should be made for materials with special storage requirements (e.g., re-frigeration, high security). The storage labeling should match the actual conditions that the material is being stored and should in-clude expiry/retest dates for approved materials. Although such labeling is inconvenient for new materials where the expiration or retest date may change as more information is known, this enables personnel to be able to determine quickly whether a particular lot of a material is nearing or exceeding the expiration or retest date. General expiry/retest dates for common materials should be based on manufacturer's recommendation or the literature. Finally, there are clear regulatory and environmental require- ments for the destruction of expired or rejected materials. It is important to observe regional and international requirements regarding the use of animal sourced materials (12). It is recom-mended to use materials that are not animal sourced and that there be available certification by the raw material manufacturers that they contain no animal sourced materials. If animal sourced raw materials must be used, then certifications by the raw material manufacturers that they either originate from certified and ap-proved (by regulatory bodies) sources for use in human pharma-ceuticals, or that the material has been tested to the level required for acceptance by regulatory agencies (following US, EU, or Japa-nese guidelines, as applicable) is required. Receipt and approval Specifications. It is a GMP requirement that all raw materials for the manufacture of drug product have appropriate specifications to ensure quality. The compendial requirements should be used for setting specifications provided the material is listed in at least one pharmaceutical compendium (e.g., US, European, and Japanese Pharmacopeias ). It is important that the use of materials meeting the requirements of a single compendium is acceptable for use in early phase clinical studies conducted in the US, Europe, and Japan. For example, a material that meets USP criteria and is used in the manufacture of a drug product should be acceptable for use in early clinical studies in the European Union. In the absence of a pharmaceutical compendium monograph, the vendor specifica-tion and/or alternative compendial specifications such as USP's Food Chemical Codex should guide specification setting. In any case, the sponsor is responsible for the establishment of appropriate specifications. Therefore, it is the authors' position that good prac-60 Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 PharmTech.comtice is to have at least a basic understanding of the manufacture, chemistry, and toxicology of the materials to guide appropriate specification setting. Material testing and evaluation. The minimum testing required for incoming materials is visual inspection and identification. How-ever, as mentioned above, the appropriate tests should be deter-mined for the material based on the knowledge of the manufac-ture, chemistry, and toxicology. If the vendor is qualified, then the certificate of analysis may be acceptable in conjunction with the visual inspection and identification testing (see \"Vendor Qualifica-tion\" section below). Approval for use. Ideally, manufacture of a bulk drug product should begin with approved material specifications and with materials that are fully tested and released. However, there are circumstances where it may not be feasible to start manufacture with approved specifications and fully tested and released mate-rials, including API. Manufacturing prior to final release (some-times called manufacturing \"at risk\") may be acceptable, however, because the quality system ensures that all specifications are ap-proved, test results are within specifications, and all relevant docu-ments are in place before the product is released for administration to humans. The \"risk\" must lie fully with the manufacturer and not with the patient. Vendor qualification. Vendors supplying excipients, raw materials, or API must be qualified by the sponsor. Appropriate qualification should depend on the stage of development and an internal risk assessment. For, example if a vendor has a history of supplying the pharmaceutical industry and the material is to be used in early development, a paper assessment (e.g., a questionnaire) should be sufficient. If a supplier does not have a history of supplying the pharmaceutical industry, a risk assessment should be performed and depending on the outcome a site audit may be required prior to accepting material for use. Ideally, vendors should be qualified prior to using raw materi- als for manufacture. However, it is acceptable for qualification to proceed in parallel as long as documentation/risk assessments are available prior to product release and as in the previous section all risk lies with the manufacturer and not the patient. Batch documentation and execution Batch record documentation preparation. Manufacturing docu- mentation is a basic requirement for all phases of clinical de-velopment. 21 CFR Parts 211.186 and 211.188 describe master production and batch production records, respectively (7). The stated purpose of the master production record is to \"assure uniformity from batch to batch.\" Although the record assur-ance is important for a commercial validated manufacturing process, it does not necessarily apply to clinical-development batches. Material properties, manufacturing scale, and quality target product profile frequently change from batch to batch. Therefore, batch production records are the appropriate docu-mentation for clinical trial supplies. Batch production records for Phase 1 materials measure per dosage unit and total weight or measure per consistent with the FDA Guidance for Industry: cGMP for Early Phase Investigational Drugs, which requires a record of manufacturing that details the materials, equipment, procedures used and any problems encountered during manufacturing (2). The records should allow for the replication of the process. On this basis, there is flexibility in the manner for which documentation of batch activities can occur, provided that the documentation allows for the post execution review by the quality unit and for the retention of these records. Batch documentation approvals. Review and approval of executed batch records by the Quality unit is required per 21 CFR Part 211.192 (7). This review and approval is required for all stages of clinical manufacturing. Pre-approvals of batch records should be governed by internal procedures as there is no requirement in CFR 21 that the Quality unit pre-approves the batch record (though this is highly recommended in order to minimize the chance of errors). Indeed, Table I shows that pre-approval of batch records by the Quality Unit is practiced by all 10 companies that participated in the IQ Consortium's drug-product manufactur-ing survey related to early development. Batch records must be retained for at least 1 year after the expiration of the batch ac-cording to CFR Part 211.180, but many companies keep their GMP records archived for longer terms. Room clearance. 21 CFR Part 211.130 requires inspection of packaging and labeling facilities immediately before use to en-sure that all drug products from previous operations have been removed. This inspection should be documented and can be performed by any qualified individual. Although line clearance for bulk manufacture is not specifi- cally mentioned in the CFR, it is expected that a room clearance be performed. At a minimum, this clearance should be per-formed prior to the initiation of a new batch (i.e., prior to batch materials entering a processing room). Hold time. During the early stages of development, final dosage form release testing confirms product quality and support estab-lishment of hold times later in the clinical development. There is no requirement to establish hold times for work in process in early development. Specific formulation and stability experi-ence, which is usually limited at this stage of development, should be leveraged to assess any substantial variations from expected batch processing times. The data gathered from these batches and subsequent development can be used to help establish hold times for future batches. (Exceptions to this approach may in-clude solution or suspension preparations used in solid dosage form manufacturing, where procedures typically govern allow-able hold times to ensure the absence of microbial contamination in the final product.) Change control. Changes to raw materials, processes, and products during early development are inevitable. It is not re-quired that these changes be controlled by a central system but Position Paper: Early Phase GMPsPharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 61rather may be appropriately documented in technical reports and manufacturing batch records. Any changes in manufac-turing process from a previous batch should be captured as part of the batch record documentation and communicated to affected areas. The rationale for these changes should also be documented as this serves as a source for development his-tory reports and for updating regulatory filings. The authors recommend that those changes that could affect a regulatory filing be captured in a formal system. Process changes. Process parameters should be recorded but do not need to be predetermined because processes may not be fixed or established in early development. Given the limited API availability in early development, a clinical batch is often the first time a product is manufactured at a particular scale or using a particular process train. Therefore, process changes should be expected. Process trains and operating parameters must be documented in the batch record but changes should not trigger an exception report or CAPA. Changes should be documented as an operational note or modification to the batch record in real time. Such changes driven by technical observations should not require prior approval by the Quality unit, but should have the appropriate scientific justification ( via formulator/scientist) or the appropriate flexibility built into the batch record to allow for the changes. This documentation should be available for Quality review prior to product disposition. Calculation of yield. Actual yields should be calculated for major processing steps to further process understanding and enable optimization of processes. Expected yield tolerances are not al-ways applicable to early development manufacture. At this stage of early development, when formulation and process knowledge is extremely limited, there may be no technical basis for setting yield tolerances and, therefore, this yield may not be an indicator of the quality of the final product. In-process controls and R&D sampling. In-process tests and controls should follow basic requirements of GMPS to document consis-tency of the batch. For capsule products, these requirements may include capsule weights and physical inspection. For tablet prod-ucts, compression force or tablet hardness and weights should be monitored together with appearance. R&D sampling, defined as samples taken for purposes of furthering process understand-ing but not utilized for batch disposition decisions, is a normal part of all phases of clinical manufacturing. In early development manufacturing, a sampling plan is required for in-process con-trol tests, but not for R&D samples. However, for the purpose of material accountability, R&D sampling should be documented as part of batch execution. For these samples, testing results may be managed separately, and are not required to be included in regulatory documentation. Conclusion Organizations involved in manufacture of Phase 1 and 2a clinical supplies should recognize that process understanding is very lim-ited in early development. Quality systems must be robust enough to ensure patient safety, but should also be flexible enough to ac-commodate accelerated timelines and process changes in real time. The special needs of small scale GMP manufacturing should also be considered when designing facilities, purchasing equipment, and selecting the type of dosage forms to use in early clinical stud-ies. Companies are encouraged to apply quality risk management principles to support these risk-based decisions. The authors also believe that underutilized approaches exist (e.g., on-site preparation of more complex dosage forms) for quickly and efficiently answering formulation related questions about bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and target release rates for controlled-release formulations. The potential benefits and risks of these approaches warrant further discussion. Finally, documenta-tion of manufacturing operations should be risk-based. Manu-facturing instructions in early development should not be overly prescriptive as to restrict process changes or discourage sampling for further process understanding. Changes should be expected, and able to be quickly reviewed and approved by the Quality de-partment, or a qualified delegate. To further stimulate discussions on these approaches within the industry and with worldwide health authorities, the IQ Con-sortium's GMPs in Early Development Working Group is plan-ning on conducting a workshop in the near future to promote robust debate and discussion on these recommended approaches to GMPs in early development. The group strongly believes that such dialogue will improve alignment between development, quality assurance, and chemistry/manufacturing/controls (CMC) regulatory groups within the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, agreement between the industry and drug regulatory authorities regarding acceptable approaches to applying GMPs in early phases of drug development would allow for a more nimble and flexible approach in early development, while still providing appropriate controls to ensure patient safety.

PT62 Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 PharmTech.com The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) has revised its elemental impurities limits and procedureal chapters with implementation set for May 2014. The author explains the need for these revisions and provides a look at some of USP's proposed techniques for elemental impurity detection and identification. Alan Cross is a scientist at RSSL, Reading Science Centre, Whiteknights Campus, Pepper Lane, Reading, to Pharmacopeia General Chapter <231> Heavy Metals have been mooted and proposed for more than a decade, and it has long been known that the current meth-ods are highly subjective and likely to prove inaccurate, at least for certain metals. The road to reform has been somewhat stuttering, but after a long period of review and commentary, on Dec. 1, 2012, General Chapter <232> Elemental Impurities\u2014Lim-its and Chapter <233> Elemental Impurities\u2014Procedures will be published in the second supplement of the US Pharmacopeia 35- National Forumulary 30 (USP-NF). On May 1, 2014, when USP 37-NF 32 becomes official, all ref- erences to Chapter <231> will cease to exist, and conformance to Chapter <232> and Chapter <233> within the General Notices will be required. The acceptance of these chapters will open the door for laboratories to use a wider range of methods for analyzing heavy metal contaminants. Of course, these methods will still need to be validated, and there may still be room for debate about which methods are best for any given situation, but at least the dubious methods of Chapter <231> will cease to be available for medicines marketed in the United States. (For the time being, the comparable methods used in the European and Japanese pharmacopoeias will continue to be available.) This paper addresses the need for new compendial requirements, with a focus on elemental impurity detection and identification. The need for change Testing for heavy metals is actually one of the most established ideas contained within the national pharmacopeias around the world. In fact, USP has included a general test for heavy metals since 1905 in the eighth volume of the pharmacopeia, which used sulphide precipitation to detect antimony, arsenic, cadmium, copper, iron, lead, and zinc. As it happens, the purpose of the test had more to do with prevention of mislabeling than pre-vention of contamination, because heavy metal salts were often used in therapy and one had to know which salts were present in a treatment. The need to detect residual contamination was established in 1942, with the introduction of USP volume XII, in which a lead-containing standard was included in the test. The goal was to detect potentially poisonous heavy metal residuals, Elemental Impurity Analysis How to Manage the Pharmacopeial Changes Ahead Alan CrossPharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 63such as lead and copper, because these metals were widely used in production equipment at the time. Interestingly, metals such as iron, chromium, and nickel were not revealed by the test (1). Ultimately, it is the inapplicability of a \"standard\" test (such as that defined by Chapter <231>) that has led to its demise and the need for more flexibility. Industry knowledge of common metal contaminants. Metal impurities are rightly a cause for concern in pharmaceutical products and there are many means by which a product might become contami-nated. There are many inorganic impurities that are deliberately added to the pharmaceutical processes (e.g., catalysts). There are other impurities that can arise as undetected contaminants from starting materials or reagents, or that come from the process itself (e.g., leaching from pipes and other equipment). Then, of course, there are metal ions that occur naturally within the plant or min-eral sources that are used to produce the active ingredients of phar-maceuticals and herbal medicines. Regardless of how metals may get into a product, or previous certification of these metals, pharmaceutical producers must carry out tests to demonstrate the absence of impurities before using materials in a pharmaceutical product. General Chapter <232>: New limits USP General Chapter <232> Elemental Impurities\u2014Limits sets out the acceptable levels of 15 elements in final drug products. These limits have been evaluated from toxicological data and are expressed in terms of a daily permissible exposure (DPE) limit. The DPE also takes into consideration the route of administra-tion (e.g., oral, parenteral, or inhalable) with orally administered drugs having a higher permissible limit than parenteral or in-haled drug products. Where elements on the list are known to be present or have the potential to be present then compliance with the specifications must be assessed. The 15 elements addressed in Chapter <232> are based on the International Conference on Har-monization's (ICH) Q3D Elemental Impurities Working Group pre-Stage 2 draft guideline (2). Chapter <232> covers arsenic, cadmium, mercury, and lead\u2014 all elements that are considered ubiquitous and therefore must be assessed in all cases. In addition, the chapter covers iridium, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, chromium, molybdenum, and nickel. The second group of elements may be present in products as a result of being added deliberately, for in-stance, in the form of a catalyst or through interactions with metal components through the manufacturing process. Because the ICH Q3D guideline is still being reviewed and is likely to expand to cover more elements, it has been decided that a review of Chapter <232> will happen after the deliberations on ICH Q3D guidelines have been completed. At this stage, the scope of Chapter <232> may be expanded to cover more elements, or an informational chapter may be incorporated to cover elements of low toxicity. The outdating of long-standing tests It is fair to point out that the methods of USP General Chapter <231> were developed before the introduction of modern analyti-cal instruments. These methods were easily transferable from one laboratory to another and did not require sophisticated instrumen-tation or specialized expertise. Hence, a competent laboratory staff member could perform the same techniques with relative ease. The problem was that the methods themselves were flawed, no matter how competent the analyst. For example, Chapter <231> methods involved subjective visual examination and comparison of the sample solution with a lead standard. Similar to the method of 1905, the compendial meth-ods used a reaction to form the sulphide of any metal ions present and the total metal content was reported against the lead standard response as a limit test. The validity of this comparison relied on several assumptions, all of which can be questioned. For example, the compendial method assumed that each of the heavy metals in the sample ma-trix would react in a like manner to lead to form a sulphide species. This assumption applied despite many sulphides being known to be insoluble and despite some elements being known to have a far more intensely colored sulphide than the lead standard against which it was being assessed. Similarly, the compendial method assumed that the reaction kinetics for lead sulphide would be very similar to that of the other metal sulphides and that reaction kinet-ics were not greatly affected by the sample matrix. A final major and unsafe assumption was that the heating and/or ashing step of the method would have no impact on volatile metals (3). Work has been carried out that suggests that recovery of mer- cury can be as little as 2% using the <231> compendial method, which clearly introduces a massive error in the final result (2). Other laboratories have reported similar poor recovery of metals such as tin, selenium, and antimony. These examples are by no means the only reasons to challenge the validity, applicability, and reliability of the compendial methods. In fact, additional chapters for the control of specific metals and other inorganic impurities have been added to USP over the years. Significant among these additions has been USP Chapter <730> Plasma Spectrochemistry, which gave laboratories the opportunity to use techniques such as inductively coupled plasma with either mass spectrometry or atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-MS and ICP-AES). The advantage of ICP methods is that they can provide specific detection and quantification for each of the elements specified in Chapter <232>. The subjectivity of the semiquantitative compari-son that is required by the compendial methods is eliminated with ICP. The ICP techniques are also quicker in most cases, requiring a smaller sample size and giving a better detection limit for all the elements of interest. The sample preparation method for ICP, for example, is less likely to lead to the loss of the volatile elements. Chapter <233>: New techniques USP General Chapter <233> Elemental Impurities\u2014Procedures sets out the general conditions for testing, covering preparation, analysis, and the parameters for validation. The preparation meth-ods referred to above are neat, direct aqueous solution, direct or-ganic solution and indirect solution. Neat samples are in such a state that they can be used without further preparation. More commonly used solutions will need to 64 Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 PharmTech.combe prepared prior to analysis, and the simplest of these procedures is preparation of a direct solution whereby a product is dissolved or diluted with water/dilute acid or an organic solvent to give a solution for analysis. In many cases, it may be desirable to treat the sample by break- ing down any organic material contained within it; such a step typically reduces the ffect of the matrix effect which might other-wise give rise to false positive/negative results. If a sample is pre-pared in this way, then it is referred to as an indirect solution. These solutions are generally prepared using a microwave digester. In this technique, a small amount of sample is weighed into a vessel and acid is added. The vessel is sealed and placed into a microwave. In the microwave, the sample is heated to temperatures of up to 250 \u00b0C and pressures of up to 55 bar. Under these conditions, the sample matrix is effectively destroyed and the metal atoms are released into solution. After the sample is cooled, it is made up to a suitable volume with water ready for analysis. ICP-MS and ICP-AES. As noted above, Chapter <233> sets out two procedures for analysis, ICP-MS and ICP-AES. The latter is also sometimes referred to as ICP-OES, which stands for optical emis-sion spectrometry. In this technique, the sample solution is fed into an argon plasma which has a temperature of approximately 10,000 \u00b0C. The sample matrix is destroyed under these conditions, and individual atoms are released. These atoms are then excited to a higher energy state. As the excited atoms cool, they return to a \"ground state.\" The process releases energy in the form of light, the wavelength of which is specific to a particular element. When this light falls on a detector, it can be quantitated and the amount of analyte can be evaluated. ICP-MS is the second procedure specified in Chapter <223>. This technique also uses a plasma, but with this technique, the plasma is used to ionize the metal atoms which are then fed into a quadrapole which separates the ions according to their mass-to-charge ratio. Following separation, the ions fall onto a detector and the sample can be quantified. Differentiating the new techniques. Both ICP-AES and ICP-MS are able to analyze several elements simultaneously. As a result, sample throughput can be very quick, typically 2-3 minutes per sample. Generally, it is fair to say that ICP-AES instrumentation is cheaper than ICP-MS, but both instruments have relatively high running costs due to the consumption of argon in the plasma. The key difference between the instruments is the detection limit. The ICP-MS typically has detection limits 100-10,000 times lower than that of ICP-AES. Both techniques are capable of analyzing to the levels required by USP, but ICP-MS can offer a much lower detection limit. Chapter <233> states that for both techniques, steps can be taken to remove matrix interferences. For ICP-AES, these interferences can occur from overlapping wavelengths. In this case, alternative wavelengths can be used for analysis. Also, many instrument manufacturers have correction techniques built into the operating software. In the case of ICP-MS, the sources of matrix interferences come from the fact that different species can have the same mass/charge ratio. For example, argon chloride appears at the same mass as arsenic, giving false positive results. To remove these interferences, many instrument manufactures use special cells within the instru- ment that can add gases to the ions and mitigate the interferences. Alternative methods Other techniques can be used in the analysis of elemental impuri-ties, but each must be validated to ensure that it is suitable and able to detect the analytes at the required level. Below are a few options: Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS): This simple and relatively cheap technique has relatively high detection limits, especially for elements such as mercury and arsenic. FAAS can only analyze one element at a time. Vapor generation atomic absorption spectrometry (VG-AAS): This tech- nique involves a chemical reaction to release metals in the form of gaseous hydrides. It has improved detection limits compared with FAAS but can only be used for arsenic, bismuth, germanium, lead, antimony, selenium, tin, and tellurium. Only one element can be analyzed at a time. Reagents are used to generate the hydride therefore generating a higher cost than traditional AAS. Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (GFAAS): In this tech- nique, a small amount of sample is slowly heated to first dry then ash the sample. Thereafter, the temperature is raised very rapidly to volatilize the metal of interest. This technique has very good sensi-tivity and can be used to look at very low levels of analyte similar to those achieved by ICP-AES, but is prone to chemical interferences affecting the results. Also the analysis is slow and can be costly. The demise of Chapter <231> means that modern techniques referred to above, and others, will now come become more com-mon, and the old wet chemistry results will cease to be valid. Conclusion One can only sympathize with the scientists at USP that have responsibility for the standard pharmacopoeial methods in-volving heavy metals. Of the 4000-plus monographs in the USP-NF, there are approximately 1000 that specify a limit of heavy metals, in either a drug substance, excipient, or drug product (4). December 2012 marks the beginning of the end for Chapter <231> and the introduction of Chapters <232> and <233>. By May 2014, <231> will cease to exist, and by this point, validated procedures need to be in place to cover the removal of Chapter <231>. The 18 months between these dates may seem like a long time, but considering the number of ex-isting monographs that contain the limit of heavy metals test, this timeframe seems very short. Overall, the USP changes, although daunting, can lead to improvements for the industry, including by better protecting the public through effectively tested medicines. Manufacturers will have peace of mind that they are providing clean and safe products to the market. References 1. O.

The author discusses strategies for an proactive cargo security and antitheft program, including best practices used by Pfizer. Brad Elrod is director of global conveyance security for Pfizer Global Logistics Compliance at Pfizer. PHOTODISC/GETTY IMAGESSupply Chain Cargo theft, for many years, was a problem that largely plagued the electronics industry, but criminals have re-cently shifted more attention to the far more lucrative pharmaceutical trade. In March 2010, thieves master- minded a heist of $75 million worth of cancer, psychiatric and blood-thinning drugs from a Connecticut warehouse by cutting a hole in the ceiling and dismantling alarms during a severe storm that masked their activities from the local au-thorities (1). To curb future cargo theft, it is imperative that pharmaceutical companies develop solid, globally applicable conveyance security programs. A clear and present danger The Connecticut incident drew a lot of attention to the level of sophistication used by organized crime when targeting pharmaceutical cargo. Soon afterwards, FDA issued a letter expressing its concern over the growing frequency of cargo and warehouse theft, the threat these activities pose to pa-tient safety, and the need for manufacturers and others in the supply chain to take proactive, preventative measures (2). More important than the loss of property, when criminals reintroduce to the supply chain stolen medication that was not stored, refrigerated, or distributed as required to maintain product quality, unknowing consumers can receive tainted or ineffective drugs that could hurt or even kill them. The rise in cargo theft is largely being fueled by the fact that penalties for stealing and distributing stolen pharma-ceuticals are far less than dealing in illicit drugs, and the value of a single pharmaceutical shipment can be far greater than electronics, cigarettes, alcohol, or even firearms ship-ments. Surprisingly, in many cases, cargo theft is reported as \"vehicular theft,\" a crime that carries a relatively low bond, which allows thieves to be quickly released to return to their work. Furthermore, a charge of vehicular theft also does not take into account the full value of the cargo. A top-of-the-line refrigerated truck costs about $500,000, but a pharmaceutical shipment could easily contain $20 million of product. The truck is most often recovered, but empty of its cargo. Until criminal penalties are increased to reflect the cargo's real value and the potential risk to public safety, it is unlikely that this growing illegal activity will subside any time soon. Attention is growing in this area, with the FDA's Office of Pharmaceutical-Based Cargo Security and Theft Prevention Brad ElrodPharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 67Drug Security, Integrity and Recalls (ODSIR) targeted to specifically deal with counterfeiting, cargo thefts, and sup-ply-chain threats in 2012 and legislation proposals such as the Safe Doses Act . For example, amendments introduced to the Safe Doses Act in May 2011 specifically addressed penal- ties, proposing increases of up to 20 years for pharmaceutical thefts. Developing a cargo security and antitheft program To develop a proactive cargo security and antitheft program, the first step is to understand how criminals work today, so newly installed systems are not protecting against yester-day's threat. Criminals are not restricted by corporate or governmental processes and are quick to adapt to changing preventative strategies. Recent trends observed in Brazil, for example, include the use of fake police checkpoints to intercept shipments (3). The factors for cargo in transit vary, depending on the lo- cation around the world. Most cargo-jackings in the United State are nonviolent in nature and often occur when the driver goes into a rest stop and returns to find the truck gone. In other parts of the world, such as Latin America, cargo theft is more prevalent and can be more violent. Drivers are often kidnapped at gunpoint and later dumped in an isolated place. To complicate the situation, local police are sometimes com-plicit in the crime. Such conditions require out-of-the-box but potentially simple solutions. For example, to protect its employees and products, Pfizer sends only smaller shipments into these high-risk regions to make each cargo shipment less valuable and less desirable to potential thieves. Freightwatch provides a succinct summary to the state of cargo theft globally in its 2011 report. \"The volume of cargo theft grew throughout the Western hemisphere, with the United States, Mexico, Brazil, and other South American countries re-porting substantial increases in theft,\" said the report. \"By con-trast in Europe, overall reporting of cargo theft rates were down while the average value per loss rose sharply, most notably in the United Kingdom, France and Germany\" (4). Despite appearances, these are not crimes of opportunity. Organized crime rings stake out facilities over time to gather information about the types and timings of shipments. Un-fortunately, large-scale distributions systems cannot easily avoid routine schedules. There are other means of protecting cargo, however, some of them as simple as backing up a truck closer to the loading deck so those surveying the site cannot see what is being loaded and patrolling property perimeters to discourage unwanted observers. Prescription medications are not the only target. Over-the- counter drugs and baby formula are at risk as well because they are relatively easy to resell. In general, most consumers do not think twice about buying a brand-name product at a flea market as long as the seal is intact. Few people stop to think about why the price is so low or consider that the product was probably stolen. If they did, they might also realize that the product was probably not handled in a manner designed to preserve quality or ingredient integrity. Systems, relationships, and improved awareness Cargo theft is committed by criminals that also poison the supply chain with counterfeiting, diversion, and economi-cally motivated adulteration. Pfizer addresses these threats holistically through a comprehensive supply-chain security program. Conveyance security is one of the key pillars of the overall program. When a logistics or transportation system is strengthened against cargo theft, the touchpoints across quality, security, procurement, and other functions also are strengthened. Cross-functional systems linkages will pre-vent and detect more than one system alone. As with most security systems, layered defenses are re- quired to prevent cargo theft, and no single device or ap-proach can be effective against all potential threats. Each situation is unique, and the level of security should result from a comprehensive risk assessment of all factors involved. Lower risk solutions include options, such as panic buttons, specially designed trailer and truck locks, satellite tracking, documentation controls, and background investigations and probationary periods for drivers. As the level of risk exposure increases, other techniques, such as door alarms, remote tem-perature monitoring, roof markings on trucks that can be identified from the air, and using two drivers, can be added to (not used in lieu of) the lower-risk prevention methods. Focusing effectively on cargo theft requires a detailed and organized set of protocols. For example, Pfizer created and implemented global, regional. and site conveyance security policies and standards called Conveyance Product Care Re-quirements (CPCR) to ensure the safe and secure transport of its products. These requirements are clear and concise and acknowledge that transporting pharmaceutical prod-ucts and materials throughout the manufacturing, packag-ing, storage, and distribution processes from raw-material acquisition through delivery to the customer is an integral aspect of supply-chain security. Transporting processes must also be in compliance with all applicable regulations and be performed in a manner that ensures the safety, identity, strength, purity and quality of products during all transit activities. To this end, Pfizer has a designated Conveyance Security Council that oversees the following: t\u0001 CPCR management, implementation, and deployment t\u0001 Global tracking device application and deployment review t\u0001 Transportation risk analysis and threat matrix development t\u0001 Carrier-security rating processes and approvals t\u0001 Cargo-security protection methodology and decision matrix t\u0001 Incident tracking and reporting programs t\u0001 Seal use, application, and review t\u0001 Regional conveyance security variance reviews and approval. Conveyance activities are coordinated externally and across any in-house function that touches cargo convey-ance, including global security, import compliance, legal, quality, risk management, business continuity, and other contin. on page 7068 Pharmaceutical Technology AUGUST 2012 PharmTech.comOUTSOURCING OUTLOOK JONATHAN EVANS/PHOTODISC/ GETTY IMAGES PharmTech.com/outsource Planning and decision-making for the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals are becoming more complex as com- panies continue to implement cost-saving efforts, including outsourcing many sup-port and even critical tasks. Companies must make difficult strategic decisions about commercial manufacture earlier in product development. A recent BioPlan Associates analysis found that essentially all biopharmaceutical developers use out-sourcing services of some kind for the manufacture of clinical or commercial supplies, process development, R&D, assay services, fill-finish, or other activities (1). Cost-cutting not a factor The BioPlan survey, which included re-sponses from 302 representatives from bio-pharmaceutical companies and CMOs in 29 countries, evaluated 23 key outsourcing areas in biomanufacturing (1). The study showed that companies are incorporating outsourcing as a manufacturing strategy rather than as an ad hoc method of add-ing flexible capacity or to simply eliminate overhead costs associated with lower value production activities. Data also show a spike in the percentage of biopharmaceu-tical companies projecting outsourcing of analytical testing, validation services, and fill-finish activities. The BioPlan study further evaluated how companies are addressing cost is-sues in biopharmaceutical manufac-turing. The survey identified activities biomanufacturers undertake to reduce costs. The study showed that outsourc-ing activities ranked in the bottom quar-ter of measured factors to reduce costs although outsourcing increased slightly for certain functions as a strategy for cost-containment during the past 12 months (see Figure 1 ). There was an increase in respondents using outsourcing of jobs in manufacturing to cut costs: 14.5% in 2012, up from 11.8% in 2011. Approxi-mately 13% of respondents outsourced jobs in process development and 8.8% did in R&D. An equal number of respondents (9.4%) reported outsourcing manufactur-ing activities to domestic and nondomes-tic service providers. (see Figure 1 ). Outsourcing budgets flat The survey showed clear evidence that budgets are bouncing back in all areas in 2012, except outsourced manufacturing. The uptick in areas other than outsourc- ing represents a change from two years ago when budgets decreased in areas ranging from production, hiring new scientific staff, and new facility construction. The survey also separately asked re- spondents to indicate how their out-sourcing in R&D and manufacturing will change during the next 12 months. On average, future outsourcing at individ-ual facilities will see moderate overall in-creases for all types of outsourcing not just manufacturing (9.3% during the next 12 months). These increases are more heav-ily distributed on key outsourcing areas (see Figure 2 ) rather than broadly seen as increases across all operations. Projections The survey evaluated 24 different areas as-sociated with outsourced operations and asked respondents which activities will be outsourced \"more often\" during the next Gauging Biopharm Outsourcing Budgets for biopharma activities are gaining in select functional areas, except outsourcing.

More than one-third (35.4%) expect to increase outsourcing of analytical testing/bioassays. BioPlan believes much of this increase relates to product character-ization, including for biosimilars. Validation services was the area where respondents predicted the highest rate of increase (32.3% indicated high rates in outsourcing in 2012, compared with 22.1% in 2011 and 23.8% in 2010). Also, 26.2% of biomanufacturers predict they will outsource significantly more fill-fin-ish operations during the next 24 months compared with 23% in 2011, and 25% in 2010. Other areas of outsourcing growth include: API biologics manufacturing,cell-line development, testing for lot release,and toxicity testing. Some recent decreases in predictions for outsourcing growth are in: downstream production operations, test-ing/product characterization, media opti-mization; upstream production operations, regulatory services, upstream process de-velopment; and testing cell-line stability. Looking ahead The biopharmaceutical industry contin-ues to focus on productivity, efficiency, getting more out of existing internal re- sources, and maximizing performance from their provider relationships. Al-though outsourcing can improve overall efficiency and reduce costs, the man-agement of relationships continues to be challenging and necessitates CMO/CRO flexibility to meet clients' shifting needs. Data from this study shows that CMOs are expanding their manufactur-ing competence through the use of novel technologies, single-use/disposable bio-reactors, and other differentiated biopro-cessing services. Improved services are resulting in increased adaptability, lower costs, faster turnaround, and higher yields, thereby offering more choice for biopharmaceutical companies. At the same time, the costs for using CMOs for product manufacturing are becoming slightly more competitive. Reference 1.

In addition to the CPCR, Pfizer functions work together to tighten security for warehouse stan-dards and ensure the safe distribution of products to consumers in the mar-ketplace. These processes are designed to protect the integrity of the legitimate supply chain against counterfeit goods getting in and to prevent legitimate product from being diverted or stolen. Site and conveyance security also requires that companies develop close relationships with governmental agen-cies sponsoring supply chain secu-rity programs, such as the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA), to ensure com-pliance with regulations and to lever-age current thinking and guidelines. In addition, industry organizations such as the Technology Asset Protec-tion Association (TAPA), the Phar-maceutical Cargo Security Coalition (PCSC), and Rx-360, the international supply-chain consortium, are impor-tant sources of practical information and best practices. At the local level, intelligence networks and a regional knowledge base need to be nurtured so reliable information can be shared with logistics managers, allowing them to better plan and improve transit and logistics operations. Regardless of where in the supply chain a theft occurs, it is ultimately the manufacturer's responsibility-if not legally, then certainly in the equally important arenas of ethics and public opinion-for assuring that all parties fulfill their duties for delivering safe and effective medicines to customers. A large part of the solution lies in raising awareness of the problem and currently available solutions. Much has already been published and discussed about counterfeiting, but little has been said publicly about cargo theft. Crimi-nals tend to aim for the weakest link in a supply chain; once a crime such as cargo theft has been committed, the security system has already gone wrong. In today's environment, the pharmaceutical industry cannot afford to be complacent. Manufacturers need to stay one step ahead of organized crime by developing and coordinating top-notch conveyance and logistical security practices throughout their organizations to assure product and patient safety worldwide.

Seven Pharmaceutical Companies Join Academic Researchers for TB Drug Discovery Seven pharmaceutical com- panies (Abbott, AstraZeneca, Bayer, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co., and Sanofi) and four research institutions (the Infectious Disease Research In- stitute; the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health; Texas A&M Univer- sity; and Weill Cornell Medical College), working with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, have launched a partnership that aims to expedite the dis- covery of new treatments for tuberculosis (TB). The partner-ship, known as the TB Drug Accelerator (TBDA), will target the discovery of new TB drugs by collaborating on early-stage research. The goal of TBDA is to create a TB drug regimen that cures patients in only one month. Existing drugs, all at least 50 years old, require six months to cure the disease\u2014a lengthy process that contributes to 20-30% of patients dropping out before completion. Aided by nearly $ 20 million from the Gates Foundation, the partners launched the TBDA in April 2012, and have begun the first round of screening for new TB drug candidates. The TBDA aims to develop five new preclinical drug candidates with treatment- shortening potential within five years and proof-of-concept for a one-month, three-drug regi- men within 10 years.Babu Padmanabhan, Managing Director and Chief Knowledge Officer of STEER Engineering PharmTech: How has the increasing focus on biopharmaceuticals af- fected your business?

PHARMA CAPSULESThe world's leading pharmaceutical event is ready for business Fine Chemicals Intermediates Biopharma Finished Dosage Excipients / Formulation Generic APIs APIs Ingredients Technology Machinery Contract Services Co-located with Are you ready to meet the global pharma industry? CPhI Worldwide, the leading pharmaceutical exhibition, is re- turning once again, offering pharma executives an opportunity to source new suppliers, network and learn more about the industry. CPhI Worldwide is being held at Feria de Madrid, Spain, from 9-11 October 2012. The show is an opportunity for pharma executives to find new suppliers, build their pro-fessional networks and learn more about the key trends in pharma today. CPhI Worldwide has a genuinely global focus, attracting visitors and exhibitors from all over the world with everything available under one roof. Last year's event, held in Frankfurt, attracted over 2,200 exhibitors from over 140 countries and more than 30,000 attendees. Entire pharma value chain under one roof CPhI Worldwide actually comprises four co-located shows. In addition to CPhI, which focuses on Pharma Ingredients, there is ICSE for Pharma Contract Services, P-MEC Europe for Pharma Technology, Equipment and Machinery and InnoPack for Pharma Packaging. Together, the shows cover every stage of the pharma value chain and cater to the specific needs of a diverse range of pharma stakeholders, with exhibitors in every area from ingre- dients, excipients and formulation through to finished dosage, technology and packaging. CPhI's unique structure has been developed to reflect the interdisciplinary synergy that characterizes pharma today. For example, bringing a successful OTC medicine to market means getting every element just right: not just the formula- tion, but also the manufacturing process, the packaging or delivery system and the contributions made by contracted service providers. The structure also allows visitors to shape their own experi- ence of the event, focusing on the suppliers and technologies that interest them most while also exploring related areas of the industry. New zones and global pavilions for 2012 All four shows within CPhI are subdivided into zones, each dedicated to a different area of expertise within the sector and designed to showcase its distinct qualities. Zoning has been warmly received by attendees because it makes the event eas- ier to navigate and enables quicker movement between areas. This year, the event features two specialized areas devoted to biopharmaceutical development resources: the Biophar- maceuticals and Bio Services Zones. The Biopharmaceuticals Zone focuses on biopharmaceuti- cal ingredients and products such as Bio Clusters, Biophar- maceuticals, Bio-similars, Bio process technologies, Biotech- nology and related specialities, Platform Technologies and Therapeutics. The Bio Services Zone is devoted to companies offering bio services and technology to the pharma industry. Other zones at the show focus on a diverse range of spe- cialist disciplines and product areas. CPhI features zones for APIs, Generic APIs, Custom Manufacturing, Fine Chemicals, Intermediates, Finished Dosage, Excipients/Formulation, a General zone and the new Biopharmaceuticals zone. ICSE includes the Bio Services zone, plus zones devoted to Logis- tics and Supply Chain, Analytical and Lab Services, Clinical Trials (including Pre-Clinical Tria ls, Clinical Trials Stages 1-4, CRO and Clinical Data Management), and a General Floor. P-MEC Europe features LABWorld, which focuses on labora- tory, analytical and biotechnology instrumentation. Finally, Inno- Pack's two zones are dedicated to Labeling and Track & Trace. ADVERTORIALThe world's leading pharmaceutical event is ready for business Co-located with Pharmaceutical IngredientsPackagingMachinery Technology Equipment Contract Services CPhI is a truly global event, attracting exhibitors and visi- tors from around the world. Recognising that some visitors have an interest in a particular geographical area as well as a particular sector, the event includes 16 Global Pavilions that allow people to find suppliers from a specific region quickly and easily. This year, new Global Pavilions have been added for Russia and Malaysia, reflecting the rapid growth of the pharmaceutical industry in these mar- kets. The other Pavilions focus on Argentina, Brazil, China, Egypt, France, India, Ireland, Korea, Morocco, Portugal, Scotland, the UK and North America, which now fea- tures SOCMA. The choice of the senior executive CPhI is renowned within the pharma in- dustry for the audience it attracts, even in comparison to other pharma-specific events. Many C-level executives attend the show; in 2011, 6 out of 10 visitors had sole or joint purchasing responsibility for the types of prod- ucts and services at the show, and 80% of visitors planned to purchase products or services from an ex- hibiting company. Because of this strong commercial focus, the event attracts many exhibitors who return year after year; many have put CPhI Worldwide at the heart of their new-business efforts. Time and again, exhibitors report that having a stand at CPhI Worldwide puts them in front of senior commercial decision-makers, allowing them to forge highly productive, long-lasting business rela- tionships face to face. Many find that their attendance unlocks new business op- portunities that would have been difficult or impossible to realise through other mar- keting channels. In 2011, 94% of visitors were somewhat to very satisfied with their experience of the show, and 83% agreed that CPhI is a \"must attend\" event. Rewarding achievement For the last few years, CPhI has hosted the Innovation Awards, which recognize outstanding innovation among the event's exhibitors. This year, the scope of the awards has been broad- ened, and they've been re- named accordingly, becom- ing the CPhI Pharma Awards. The awards aim to honour companies who turn inspi- ration into innovation\u2014the thinkers and creators break- ing new ground in manufac- turing, drug delivery, sustain- able packaging and stand design.

The CPhI Pharma Awards feature three categories: Best Innovation, Best Sustainable Packaging and Best Sustain- able Stand Design. Best Innovation recognizes outstanding achievement in pharmaceu- tical R&D, highlighting pio- neers in new, commercially scalable technologies. Best Sustainable Pack- aging, newly introduced for 2012, rewards Pharma pack- aging companies who have created a specific material, machine or service that allows pharma companies to achieve a more sustainable packaging, or packaging process. The creation of this award reflects the industry-wide move towards more sustainable materials and processes. The Best Sustainable Stand Design award celebrates ex- hibitors who have taken positive steps towards sustainability in the design and construction of their stands\u2014using green materials, reusing, recycling and so on. The Best Sustainable Stand Design award is just one of a range of sustainability initiatives being undertaken by UBM Live, the organizers of CPhI Worldwide. UBM Live was the first major event organizer to achieve self-certification under BS 8901, with the Amsterdam office being accredited in November 2011. Soon afterwards, the standard was rolled out to events organized by UBM Live. Now the company is working towards ISO certification, which will take its commitment to sustainability to the next level. A dedicated Sustainable Fea-ture area will also be available at CPhI. Entry for the CPhI Pharma Awards is open to exhibitors at CPhI Worldwide, ICSE, P-MEC Europe and InnoPack. The deadline for Best Inno- vation and Best Sustainable Packaging is 10 August 2012, while Sustainable Stand Design is open until 31 August. The shortlist will be announced on 7 September, with presentations being held by shortlisted exhibitors at the CPhI Speakers Corner on 9 October. Details of how to enter can be found online at www.cphi.com/pharma-awards .CPhI Global Meetings The commercial opportunities available at CPhI are signifi- cant: the average visitor holds a departmental budget of over \u20ac3.7m and makes eight new business contacts while at the show. With so many potentially relevant stands and just three days to see them all, there's always a risk that ex- hibitors and visitors will fail to connect with their ideal commercial partner. Anxious to avoid this, many attendees have taken to pre-arranging their meet- ings with exhibitors; the average visitor attends 16 meetings at the show, of which nine are pre-arranged. The success of this depends on visitors carrying out proactive research in order to identify who they should see. This year, for the first time, the event's The average visitor holds a departmental budget of over \u20ac3.7m and makes eight new business contacts while at the show. ADVERTORIALThe world's leading pharmaceutical event is ready for business Co-located with Pharmaceutical IngredientsPackagingMachinery Technology Equipment Contract Services organizers are offering an official 'Match and Meet' service\u2014a sort of matchmaking service for attendees. CPhI Global Meetings give exhibitors direct access to senior- level executives such as procurement managers, contract manag- ers and business development managers from across the entire pharma industry. It allows them to meet pre-qualified buyers who are actively looking for new partnerships, products and services. The service is fully tailored around the needs of exhibitors and visitors, who can simply request meetings based on their areas of specialization. They are then carefully matched up with hand-picked buyers, using the buyers' purchasing re- quirements as a guide. One week before the event, a list of matched meetings is submitted for the exhibitor's approval. The system typically delivers four or five meetings per sup- plier, each scheduled to last around 20 minutes and held at the exhibitor's own stand or in a dedicated meeting area. Conferences and seminars Another reason to attend CPhI Worldwide is the impressive array of conferences, talks and seminars, which allow visitors and exhibitors to develop their industry knowledge and keep up to speed with emerging trends. The Pre-Connect Conference will be held on October 8, the day before the main event opens for business. Visitors willing to invest an extra day can take advantage of a programme split into two halves on Development and partnering and Manufac- turing\u2014or mix and match modules between the programmes. Development and partnering features modules on Generics and super-generics, Biosimilars and biobetters and Strategic partnerships, while Manufacturing covers Drug delivery sys- tems, API sourcing in emerging markets and Biomanufacturing. Both programmes run from 8:30 am to 8 pm, including breaks for networking and tapas and an evening drinks reception. Once CPhI Worldwide opens the following day, attendees can take advantage of a wide range of lunchtime education sessions, each focusing on a key topic in pharma today. The full programme has yet to be confirmed, but based on previ- ous years the sessions are sure to be relevant, authoritative and hugely popular with visitors. For those with less time to spare who want to get up to speed with some recently launched innovations, the Speak- er's Corner areas provide the facility for exhibitors to deliver 20-minute 'bite-sized' speeches on their new launches. Speaker's Corners are situated in CPhI, ICSE and InnoPack. Enjoying Madrid When not at the event itself, attendees can enjoy the many attractions of Madrid, from the Puerta del Sol, Royal Palace and Almudena Cathedral to the world-famous Prado Museum. Visitors can also enjoy the city's famous nightlife, caf\u00e9 culture and shopping opportunities.

This scalability feature of CFRs is appealing for circumventing nonscaling problematic chemistries in a timely fashion. It is not uncommon for there to be one or mor e steps in an initial disc overy synthesis that is not amenable to ba tch processing. When this occurs , significant time, effort, and money have to be invested in process research and/or developmen t to resolve the chemistry or retool the synthesis . CFR technology, on the other hand , offers the potential t o scale the e xisting problematic chemistry to overcome the bottleneck. For example, Johnson an d Johnson (New Brunswick , NJ) dem-onst rated the utility of CFR technology f or rapidly scaling g ram to kilogram quantities of early-stage clinical tr ial API where ba tch p rocessing was a concern (4). Several classes of reac tions that presented safety or hazardous concerns for batch manufacturing were shown to scale efficien tly, safely, and with shor ter process research times. The reaction classes r eported by the Johnson and Johnson g roup included e xothermic reactions, reactions at elevated temperatures, reactions with unstab le intermediates, and reac-tions involving hazar dous reagen ts (4). Implementing CFR technology in an otherwise ba tch process t o resolve early scalable issues provides an attrac-tive strategy for expediting ear ly-stage process development. Under this mixed \"batch-CFR\" paradigm, the problematic step(s) can be optimiz ed to a CFR early on in the pr ocess allowing the chemistr y to be readily scaled fr om grams to kilograms. Manufacturers of continuous CFRs such as C orning (Corning, NY) make smaller scale r eactors that can be used f or optimiz-ing the continuous-flow chemistry on a small scale and employing the smaller reactor to make the desir ed product on a scale of g rams to about a kilogram. When larger-scale production is required, the chemistr y is r eadily transferred to an identical larger reactor simplifyin g the technology tr ansfer process from laboratory scale to plant scale . Consequently, the \"Batch-CFR\" approach has the pot ential t o be more expedient and cost effective as it takes advantage of CFR t echnology's ability to scale existing chemistr y that is not suitable or safe f or larger-scale batch processing. CFR technology ma y also allow the CMO t o scale reactions beyond the capacit y of their fixed reactors as an alternative to doing a technology tr ansfer to another facilit y with larger fixed reactors. The contract manufacturer will still likely use fix ed equipment t o process the continuous-flow reaction maelstrom. Although significant gains have been made in in-pr ocess monitoring and continuous crystallization, at the present time, it is more expedient for early-stage continuous flow reactions to be worked-up using tr aditional met hodology such as filtration, extraction, solvent removal, and crystallization in fixed equipment . If the projec t moves to commercialization, particularly in the hands of a lar ge pharmac eutical company, the process is more likely to become a fully optimiz ed c ontinu-ous process from start to finish. With a \"Batch-CFR\" process, this transition should be facilitated since the more challenging chemistr y has already been adapted to CFR technology.The decision b y a CMO to implemen t CFR technology t o resolve a process scale-up issue is a critical risk decision r equiring buy-in from the sponsor clien t. The technology holds significant promise for efficient and cost-effective development of early-stage cGMP pr ocesses. The \"Batch-CFR\" approach provides a much g reater probability for scaling the initial disc ov-ery synthesis directly, thereby requiring significantly less process research and development work. CFR technology, ho wever, requires different strate-gic thinking and technical expertise compared with classical ba tch manu-facturing. Because most drug- development professionals are classically trained, there is likely to be some n atural resistance to implemen ting CFR technology in ear ly-drug development. This mindset has been r eferred to as \"batch mentality (5). However, with FDA and the phar mac eutical industr y encouraging the shift to CFR technology, contract manufacturers are likely to follow suit. Sources 1. A. Pellek and P. Van Arnum, Pharm.

James Hamby , PhD, is vice-president of business dev elopment at Ash Stevens, 18655 Krause Street, 9 pharmtech.com The Industry's Authoritative Source The current trend in the pharmac eutical industry for the manufacture of small-molecule therapeutic agents is moving toward continuous flow pro- cesses. In 2007, the Novartis-MIT Center for Continuous Manufacturing was established with $65 million in funding from the drug company. The center is proposing a \"Blue Sky\" concept where there is a continuous process from the start of a chemical synthesis through final pharmaceutical dosage form (1, 2). The Blue Sky program is an ambitious goal but is gaining ground rap- idly among thought leaders in the pharmac eutical industry and US Food and Drug Administration. Consequently, the momentum for this concept is likely to ha ve a trickle-down effect for contr act manufacturers (CMOs) that design and develop early-stage manufacturing processes for clients devel- oping innovator small-molecule drugs. Continuous-flow technology Continuous-flow technology involves the continuous introduction of a stream of chemical reactants into a flow or microreactor to yield a desired reaction product on a continuous basis. The v ersatility and usefulness of continuous-flow reactor (CFR) technology is expanding rapidly with an ever broadening scope of applicable chemistries and the development of new flow technologies (3). Champions of continuous-flow technology cite a wide range of potential advantages compared with traditional batch manufacturing of pharmaceuticals. In general, the greater optimization and c ontrol achievable with CFR technology can translate to significant sav- ings in time and costs and can have a favorable safety and environmental impact. Furthermore, the small-reaction volume, broad operating pressure and temperature ranges, and mixing efficiencies of flow reactors extends the repertoire of chemistries bey ond that of the safety and technical limita- tions of batch reactors. The capital investment for CFR technology is also substantially less, as is the footprint required in the plant than a similar capacity ba tch-reactor system. However, even though the potential advan- tages of CFR technology can be significant, the technology is currently n ot applicable or practical in all situations. Early-stage development Adapting CFR technology to early-stage development projec ts has sig- nificant merit, but also significant challenges. CMOs work with numerous sponsor clients, diverse chemistries, and projec ts in all stages of develop- ment. Many of the projec ts CMOs encounter ar e very early stage with the development candidate being licensed out of an academic laboratory or coming directly fr om the sponsor company's discovery laboratories. These early-stage projec ts more often than not require various degrees of process r esearch and/or process dev elopment to make the discovery synthesis amenable to current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) scale- up. Also, to r eceive additional funding or secure a development partner, the sponsor company has a strong sense of urgency to enter the clinic and achieve proof-of-concept as soon as possible. This puts pressure on the CMO to rapidly develop a scalable process t o meet the near-term active pharmac eutical ingredient (API) goals of the sponsor company and at the same time enable the process t o further scale-up to meet later stage API demands. Small-molecule drug development processes are typically in the range of six to eight synthetic steps. Giv en the time constraints and level of technical challenge, the design of an initial six to eight step totally continuous-flow process f or an early-stage drug development projec t is generally not practical and is typically reser ved for established commercial processe s. CFR technology, however, does offer the distinct advantage of Contract Manufacturing and Continuous Flow Reactor Technology for Early-Stage Drug Development James Hamby save on these and other educational resources at www.industrymatter.com | 800.598.6008QbD (Quality by Design): A systematic approach to product and process design and development, compiles the best content from BioPharm International and Pharmaceutical Technology to provide valuable insight into the topic and assist you in making the business case for QbD based on the criteria decision makers need to evaluate initiatives and related technology.QBD (QUALITY BY DESIGN): VOLS I AND II COMBO .90 $299 FROM QbD (Quality by Design) Vol. II A systematic approach to product and process design and development 3 QbD Gains Momentum 4 Bench-Scale Characterization of Cleaning Process Design Space for Biopharmaceuticals 13 QbD Case Study Will Push Limits 14 Monitoring of Biopharmaceutical Processes: Present and Future Approaches 21 QbD: Convincing the Skeptics 26 Analytical Tools for Process and Product Characterization 35 Quality Risk Management Demystied at CMC Strategy Forum 41 Quality by Design for Biotechnology Products: Part 1 51 Quality by Design for Biotechnology Products: Part 2 60 Quality by Design for Biotechnology Products: Part 3 67 QbD and GMPs: How the Convergence of Science and Compliance Will Change the Way We Work 70 Quality by Design A-MAb Case Study Challenges Conventional Thinking 72 Quality by Design and Compliance Readiness 75 Setting Specications for a Biotech Therapeutic Product in the Quality by Design Paradigm 80 QbD: A Roadmap to Adoption 81 Critical Challenges to Implementing QbD 85 Global Regulatory Submissions for QbD 89 Equivalence-by-Design for Advanced Dosage Forms and Drug Products 94 The Relevance of Continuous Solid Oral Dosage Processing and NIR Spectroscopy 99 Quality by Design for Generic Drugs segamI ytteG/noisiV latigiD QbD(Quality by Design) A systematic approach to product and process design and developmentPhotodisc/Getty Imagessega mI ytteG/xxoF nhoJ 1 The Outlook for Quality by Design 2 The New Era of Process Validation 3 How to Make the Business Case for Quality by Design 9 Quality by Design: Industri al Case Studies on Dening and Implementing Design Space for Pha rmaceutical Processes, Part 1 15 Quality by Design: Industrial Case Studies on Dening and Implementing Design Space for Pharmaceutical Processes, Part 2 22 Quality by Design in the CM O Environment 30 Design Space for Biotech Products 34 Coming to a Biotech Near You: Quality by Design, Part 1: Its Applicability in Biopharmaceuticals 37 Coming to a Biotech Near You: Quality by Design, Part 2: Design Space in Development and Manufacturing 41 QbD for Analytical Methods 42 FDA Encourages Quality by Design Initiatives 44 Industry, Regulators Move to Adopt Quality Standards 48 The Evolution of FDA's Role in Ensuring Product Quality 52 The Application of Quality by Design to Analytical Methods 58 A FDA Perspective on Qual ity by Design 60 FDA Seeks Regulatory Flexibility 63 FDA's Pharmaceutical Quality Initiatives 73 FDA Proposes Flexible Oversight for Quality Systems 76 Bridging the D evelopment-Manufacturing Gap to Achieve QbD and PAT 77 Developing and Us ing Analytical Methods ELEMENTS OF BIOPHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTION SERIES, FOURTH EDITION Led by Dr. Anurag Rathore.

Improv- ing the safety of drugs throughout the supply chain will come at great expense and will only succeed through the dil-igence of all stakeholders. FDA must be attentive with its drug approval and inspection procedures, and drug producers must remain committed to manufacturing drug ingredients gov-erned by cGMPs. The pharmaceutical industry becomes more global each day, and it becomes increasingly clear that all manufacturers must work to implement quality programs. As the law is implemented in stages over the next few years, the hope is that the industry will see results from these major steps taken to safeguard the drug supply. The ongoing dialogue between drug manufacturers and FDA has led to a path forward that can hopefully ease the minds of consumers. How-ever, there is more work to be done. Currently, foreign over-the-counter (OTC) drug manufacturing is not being inspected, nor is their inspec- tion included in the passage of the FDA Reform Act. Hopefully, a risk-based inspection approach will be applied to OTC products as well in the future. References 1. B.

A risky market In the past, the US drug supply has been susceptible to sub-par quality drugs due to the lack of enforcement of basic drug quality inspections of foreign facilities\u2014leading to lax qual-ity compliance standards. According to FDA, approximately 80% of APIs are imported, primarily from high-risk regions, such as Asia (1, 2). FDA has been unable to accurately identify all foreign facilities manufacturing drugs entering the US, and the agency does not have the resources or systems in place to track such foreign facilities for the purpose of quality inspections. Although domestic pharmaceuti- cal companies can expect an FDA inspection every two to three years, most of their foreign counterparts have never been inspected by FDA. According to a 2010 GAO report (3), it would take FDA, with current re-sources, more than nine years to in-spect all foreign facilities just once. The lack of routine risk-based inspec-tion of foreign facilities endangers the safety of the global drug supply chain, encourages non-domestic job growth, and has the potential of becoming a national security issue. FDA gains resources With the passage of the FDA reform bill, the agency indicated in negotia-tions with stakeholders that it will have the resources it needs to inspect all for- eign and domestic generic-drug pro-duction facilities with regularity (4). Inspections will be performed on a risk basis, focusing on the facilities posing the greatest risk to the supply chain. This will provide greater con-fidence in the safety of generic drugs imported from developing countries. Members of the Bulk Pharmaceu- ticals Task Force (BPTF), an industry trade organization of drug ingredient makers within the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates, will be among those paying FDA nearly $1.5 billion over the course of five years to accomplish these goals. The Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA), which was negotiated last year by BPTF mem-bers and other industry trade groups, is included in the FDA Reform Act. GDUFA will expedite the availability of more affordable, high-quality ge-neric drugs; enhance FDA's ability to prevent substandard and misbranded drugs from entering the supply chain; and level the playing field between for-eign and domestic firms. Significantly, the legislation also au- thorizes FDA to confiscate and destroy counterfeit, adulterated, or misbranded drugs that enter the US rather than returning them to foreign manufac-turers. Past practices forced FDA to send the drugs back to their country of origin, where they were ultimately returned to the drug supply chain in other countries. Industry and FDA collaborate Among the most significant but least-known developments contributing to this legislative success is the fact that, at a time when company budgets are tight and economic uncertainty runs high, generic-drug producers volun-tarily agreed to pay these fees to avoid New law provides FDA with the resources it needs to safeguard drug supply chain.Enactment of FDA Reform Act Improves Drug Safety John DiLoreto is executive director of the Bulk Pharmaceuticals Task Force, an affiliate organization of the Society of Chemical Manufacturers and Affiliates (SOCMA).The ongoing dialogue between drug manufacturers and FDA has led to a path forward.
