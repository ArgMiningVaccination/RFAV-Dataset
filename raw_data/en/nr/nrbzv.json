Word count : 3080 2 Abstract Background . Short sleep duration is associated with concomitant behavioral difficulties , but the longitudinal association between sleep duration and later behavior in early childhood remains unclear . The aim was to study the association between sleep duration trajectories throughout preschool and behavior at age 5-6 years . Participants 1021 children of the French birth -cohort EDEN were included in this study . Methods . Night -sleep duration trajectories were modeled on the basis of repeated measures collected at age 2, 3 and 5-6 years by parental questionnaires. Behavior was assessed with the Strength s and Difficult ies Questionnaire (SDQ) , with five subscales measuring conduct problems, emotional symptoms, peer relation problems, antisocial behavior , and hyperactivity -inattention problems. The subscales were dichotomized by the 25th percentile. Multivaria ble logistic regression, adjusted for baseline behavior, and assessment of multiple confounding factors allowed for study ing the independent association between night -sleep duration trajectories from age 2 to 6 and behavior at age 5-6. Results . Five distinct sleep -duration trajectories were identified . At age 5-6 years, probability of hyperactivity -inattention problems was increased for boys belonging to the \" short sleep \" and \"medium -low sleep \" duration trajectory and girls belonging to the \" changing sleep \" duration trajectory as compared with children with the medium -high sleep duration trajectory (boys: OR 2.69 [95% and .79 [1.09 - 7.17], p=0 .03). No associations were observed with the other SDQ subscales. Conclusion . The persistence of short night -sleep durations in preschool years as well as a sudden decrease at age 3 are risk factors of hyperactivity -inattention problems at school start. Keywords Sleep duration, preschooler, behavior, group -based trajectory modeling, longitudinal study 3 Abbreviations SS: -sleep duration trajectory 4 Introduction Sleep duration and architecture evolve rapidly in the first years of life . The few studies that have model ed the evolution of sleep duration and sleep consolidation in early childhood revealed that this maturation varies among children (Plancoulaine et al., 2018; Reynaud et al., 2016; Touchette et al., 2009) . Those studies also pointed out that without intervention, sleep difficulties, such as short sleep duration and frequent night -waking , show a persistent pattern from age 2 to 5-6 years . A growing body of literature indicates that short sleep duration is associated with concomitant behavioral difficulties in school -age children (for review , see Astill, Van der Heijden, Van Ijzendoorn, & Van S omeren, 2012 ) but also as early as pre -school years (for review , see Reynaud, Vecchierini, Heude, Charles, & Plancoulaine, 2018 ). None theless, the longitudinal association between sleep duration and later behavior in preschool years is still an open topic of research , with few studies investigating this issue using a longitudinal design (Bouvette - Turcot et al., 2015; Jansen et al., 2011; Sivertsen et al., 2015, 2015; Touchette et al., 2009; Williams et al., 2017) . In the Jansen et al. study (2011), which included 4 782 children, sleep duration at age 2 years was associated with anxious/depressed symptoms at age 3 years, and this association remained significant after adjusting for baseline anxious/dep ressed symptoms (at 18 months). Bouvette -Turcot et al . (2015) observed a gene tic susceptibility in the longitudinal association between sleep duration and behavior: average sleep duration from 6 to 36 months was negatively associated with emotionality/behavioral dysregulation at age 36 month s in the 131 children with one or two copies of the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (5 -HTTLPR) but not for other children . These studies focused on associations with a single internalizing behavior, but Siverstsen et al . (2015) covered a larger range of behavioral aspects among 32 662 children : as compared with children who slept 13 hr at 18 months, those who slept 10 hr were significantly more likely to present higher 5 aggressive behavior, attention problems, anxiety/depression and emotional reactivity at age 5 years; the difference with somatic complaints was not significant . Two studies consider ed several exposure points of sleep duration in preschool years. In the Huhdanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al. study (2019) , sleep duration at 3 months, 8 months and 24 months was studied separately and associated with inattention and hyperactivity at age 5 years. All time points considered individually were negatively associated with later inatte ntion but no ne were associated with later hyperactivity. In the Touchette et al . study (2009) , sleep trajectories from age 1.5 to 5 years were modeled in 2056 children using group -based trajectory methodology (GBTM). This method optimizes the use of the information obtained from repeated measures and allows for complex evolution modeling . The authors showed increased risk of hyperactivity in children presenting persistent short sleep duration between age 1.5 and 5 years (i.e., 9 hr/night). No study has reported the longitudinal evolution (as identified by G BTM) and several behavior al dimensions in the same population. To complete the current literature, we assess ed the association of night -sleep duration trajectories from age 2 to 5 -6 (modeled using GBTM) with multiple facets of behavior at age 5-6, in a large birth -cohort . Our hypothesis was that sleep trajectories , which better describe sleep duration evolution over time, may predict behavioral difficulties in preschoolers . Methods Study population Details of the study protocol have been published previously (Heude et al., 2015) . To summarize , pregnant women before their 24th week of amenorrhea were recruited between 2003 and 2006 in two French university hospitals (Poitiers and Nancy) . Those younger than 18, unable to give informed consent, functionally illiterate in French, with a history of diabetes, planning to chang e residence or without social security coverage were excluded 6 from the cohort. Women with multiple pregnancies were also excluded. Among the 3758 women invited to participate, 2002 (53%) agreed to participate . Finally, because of miscarriages, stillbirths, and attriti on, 1899 children were included at birth . Written informed consent was obtained twice from parents: at enrolment and after the child's birth. The study was approved by the ethics research committee of Bic\u00eatre Hospital (Comit\u00e9 Consultatif de Protection des Personnes dans la Recherche Biom\u00e9dicale) and by the Data Protection Authority (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libert\u00e9s). Measures All variables included in the analysis were collected by paper -based parent questionnaires. Measure of exposure : night -sleep duration trajectory . When the child was age 2, 3, and 5-6 years , parents were asked about the usual bedtime and wake -up time of the child , which allowed for estimat ing the night time-in-bed duration at each age. To optimi ze the analysis of this longitudinal data, we model ed the night time-in-bed sleep duration evolution over time. Repeated measures were used to model a proxy of night -sleep duration trajectories across preschool years among the 1205 children with sufficient data (i .e., at least two time points of night -sleep duration) by using group -based trajectory modeling (Nagin, 2005) . The method is based on the underlying hypothesis that, within a population, inherent groups evolve according to different patterns. The groups are not directly identifiable or pre -established by sets of characteristics but are statistically determined by series of responses. Using t he PROC TRAJ procedure in SAS 9 .4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) , multiple models were created, varying by number of groups and shapes (computed by polynomial equations). The best-fitted model was determined by comparing those models by using, among other criteria, Bayesian information criteria (BIC). Its quality was verified according to the recommended criteria: average posterior p robabilities for each subgroup > 0.7, odds of correct classification > 5, and the model's estimation of the trajectory prevalence 7 and the actual prevalence being close ( 3% difference) (Nagin, 2005) . Each child was attributed to the trajectory for which he/she had the highest probability of belong ing to. Five night -sleep duration trajectories were identified : a short -sleep (SS) duration trajectory (<10 hr 30 min/night) children; a medium -low-sleep (MLS) duration trajectory (10 hr 30 min to 11 hr/night) representing 48.4% of children; a medium -high-sleep (MHS) 11 hr 30 min/night) representing 37.0% of children; a long- sleep (LS) duration trajectory (11 hr 30 min/night) representing 4.3% of children; and a changing -sleep (CS) duration trajectory (i.e. , up to age 3 similar to the LS and then MLS duration trajectory) representing 5.3% of children (Figure 1). Further description s of the trajectories were previously published (Plancoulaine et al., 2018) . Measure of outcome: behaviors Behavior was assessed by using the p arent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman, 1997) when the child was on average 5 .6 years old (SD= 0.16). The SDQ includes five subscales ranging from 0 to 10 : four subscales assess behavioral problems (hyperactivity -inattention , conduct problems, emotional symptoms , and peer relationship problems ) and one subscale assesses pro-social behavior. In subscales assessing behavioral problems, a higher score indicates greater difficulties, with the reverse for the pro - social subscale. The subscale scores were skewed and could not be normalized , so they were dichotomized based on the studied population distri bution. For each behavioral problem subscale , children were divided into those with a score greater than the 75th percentile and the others. This threshold was considered to allow sufficient sample size in each category. For the pro-social subscale, the division was between those with a score lower than the 25th percentile and the others, thus favoring identification of the highest behavioral difficulties within the studied population. This dichotomization corresponded to a score >4 for 8 hyperactivity -inattention , >3 for conduct problems, >3 for emotional symptoms, >1 for peer relationship problems , and <8 for pro -social behavior. Thus, each behavior outcome corresponded to the question: \"Is the child among the 25% of children with the hig hest behavioral difficulty score ?\" (yes/no). On sensitivity analysis, the analyses were repeated by using the clinical dichotomization thresholds validated in French school -aged children (Shojaei 2009) : >5 for hyperactivity -inattention , >2 for conduct problems, >3 emotional >3 for peer rel ationship problems , and <7 for pro -social behavior. Each behavior outcome corresponded to the question: \" Does the child have a behavioral difficulty score above the norm? \" (yes/no). Emotional symptoms, hyperactivity -inattention problems , conduct problems , and pro -social behavior s were also evaluated at age 2 by using a parental behavioral questionnaire specific to the EDEN birth cohort study (Table S3) . Covariates Covariates were integrated in the statistical models to take into account potential confounding factors, including parental and child characteristics and lifestyle . Their selection was based on the literature (Reynaud et al., 2018) and bivariate analyses (i.e., age-adjusted associations SDQ subscale , Table S1). Covariates regarding p arental characteristics collected during pregnancy included the following : - Household income (<1500\u20ac, 1500 -3000\u20ac, >3000\u20ac per month ; US dollar $1600, $1600 -3250, > $3250 per month ) - Education (defined as the highest number of years of study reached by one of two parents) - Mother's age at delivery - Smoking during pregnancy (yes/no) - History of parental behavior probl ems in childhood (one or both parents declar ing that they 9 had a behavioral problem during childhood ) - Mother's depressive symptoms during pregnancy (evaluated with the Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES -D), with a cutoff score of 23 , threshold validated in French women (Fuhrer & Rouillon, 1989) ). Covariates regarding the child's characteristics included the following: - Sex - Birth order (first/other) - Term at birth (weeks of amenorrhea) - Breastfeeding duration (in months) - Temperamental traits (namely activity, shyness , emotionality and socia bility, assessed at age 1 year by using the Emotionality Activity and Sociability scale (EAS) (Buss & Plomin, 2008) ) Covariates regarding life style and sleep habits at age 2 years included the following : - Maternal working status (yes/no ) - Number of hours spent in front of the television per day (collected separately for school days and free days from which w e deduced an average time per day ). - Main care arrangement (collective settings such as preschool or day care centers vs home care) - Parental presence needed for the child to fall asleep (yes/no) - Child regular bedtime (yes/no) - Child f requent night -waking defined as occurring every other night or more per week (yes/no) (Reynaud et al., 2016) - Nap duration (hours per day) 10 Statistical Analys is Missing data for the covariates represented 3.3% of the total dataset and multiple imputations were performed by using chained equation s (SAS \"MI\" procedure). Variables were imputed by fully conditional specification methods (i.e. , using discriminant, logistic or linear regression methods according to the variable types). We generated 10 independent imputed datasets. The SAS Mianalyze procedure was used for multivaria ble logistic regression analysis of the association s between the night -sleep duration trajectories and each of the five SDQ behavior subscales (in their dichotomized form, described above) . First, we analyzed the raw association between night -sleep duration trajectories and behavior at age 5 -6 (Table 2, raw model) , then adjust ed for potential confounding factors described above (Table 2, model 1) . Next , we adjusted additionally for the corresponding behavior at age 2 ( Table 2, model 2) to take into account baseline behavior and account for potential reverse causality . Model 2 was not performed for the peer -relationship problem subscale because it was not evaluated in the birth -cohort at age 2 years . Sex interaction was investigated between sleep duration trajectories and behavior. Analyses with the final models were r epeated by using the clinical thresholds for all SDQ subscales, validated in French school -aged children , as sensitivity analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc. , Cary, NC, USA) . P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Population Description Information regarding night -sleep duration trajectory and behavior was available for 1021 children, representing 54% of the children enrolled at birth. As c ompared with children who 11 were not included, for those who were included , parents had a higher income ( 30.0% vs 23.4% had income >3000\u20ac per month, p<0.0001) and higher level of education ( 14.6 vs 13.4 years of study , p<0.001). Mothers were slightly older ( 30.2 vs 28.7 , p<0.001), less depressed ( 6.0% vs 12.1%, 19.9% vs 32.0%, p<0.001) and breastfed for longer (3 .4 vs 3.0 months, p=0 .02). The characteristics of the 1021 children included in the analysis are in Table 1. Mothers were 30 years old on average at delivery and 46% of the children were girls. At age 2, children watch ed 41 min of television per day on average . [Table 1 near here] Association s The raw and adjusted odds ratio s (aOR s) between night -sleep duration trajectories and child behavior are presented in Table 2. Sleep duration trajectories were significantly associated with hyperactivity -inattention in both models . Thus, SS, MLS and CS trajectories were associated with increased probability of hyperactivity -inattention at age 5 -6 independent of hyperactivity -inattention behavior at age 2. We observed n o association between sleep duration trajectories and the other subscales, namely conduct problems, emotional symptoms, peer relationship problems and low pro -social behav ior subscales. [Table 2 near here] For -inattention and low pro -social behavior subscales , probability of being among the 25% of children with the highest problematic behavior was greater for boys than girls (Table 3). We observed a n interaction between sleep trajectories and hyperactivity -inattention (p=0.07) but not Probability of hyperactivity -inattention at age 5 -6 was increased for boys in the SS and MLS 12 duration trajectories , but no associations were found for the CS duration trajectory (Table 4). However, probability of hyperactivity -inattention at age 5 -6 was increased for girls in the CS duration trajectory (Model 2 aOR 2.83 p=0 .03), with no associations found for the SS or MLS duration trajectories . On sensitivity analysis, with SDQ clinical thresholds used instead of thresholds based on the sample distribution, fewer children were classified as having hyperactivity -inattention (N=159 ; 106 boys ). The association between the sleep trajectories and this subscale was similar for boys but was not significant for girls (Table S2). [Table 4 near here] Discussion This study showed that persistent night -sleep duration <11 hr/night between age 2 and 5 -6 years is associated with increased risk of hyperactivity -inattention symptoms evaluated by the SDQ at age 5 -6 years, independent of hyperactivity -inattention at age 2. We found n o associations between night -sleep duration trajectories and other SDQ subscale s. In the only other lo ngitudinal study that focused on associations between night -sleep duration and hyperactivity, results were consistent with ours. Indeed , in a sample of 2056 children aged 1.5 to 5 years, Touchette et al. (2009) showed that persistent short sleepers (9 hr/night) presented a 4-fold increased risk of hyperactivity . hyperactivity -inattention subscale has been found an accur ate tool for the screening of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in preschoolers when rated by parents and using a threshold of >4 (\u00d8vergaard et al., 2018) , as in the current study. Unlike Jansen et al. (2011) , we did not fi nd an association between sleep duration and internalizing symptoms. However, we assessed internalizing symptoms by using the emotional symptoms and the peer -relationship problems subscale of the SDQ , whereas Jansen et al . used the anxiety/depressed symptoms subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist . In 13 addition, the two studies used different timing for both sleep duration and internalizing symptoms measures. W e analyzed persistent night sleep durations between ages 2 and 5 -6 years , adjusted on day sl eep, in relation with internalizing symptoms measured at age 5 -6 years , whereas Jansen et al . analyzed mean total sleep duration at age 2 years (including day sleep) in relation with internalizing symptoms at age 3 years . These difference s in age, tool and dimension measured could explain th e discrepanc y. Our results indicated greater behavioral difficulties among boys than girls , which is consistent with the literature , especially for hyperactivity -inattention behavior; indeed, ADHD prevalence has been found to be two to three times higher in boys than girls (Polanczyk et al., 2007; Ro mano et al., 2006) . Also, boys show shorter sleep duration than do girls (Biggs et al., 2013 ; Blair et al., 2012; Plancoulaine et al., 2015) . In a recent cross -sectional study of 181 US children (125 boys) aged 5 -13 years, girls with ADHD showed longer sleep duration but more sleep disturbances than did boys (Becker et al., 2018) , which provides preliminary evidence of sex differences in sleep functioning among children with ADHD. In our population sample , after adjustment on child temperament and behavior eval uation at age 2 years, only boys in the two persistent shortest night sleep duration trajectories (i.e. , <10 hr 30 min and 10 hr 30 min to 11 hr/night between age 2 and 5 -6 years) showed increased probability of hyperactivity -inattention score at age 5 -6, with a dose effect (aOR 2.69 [95% CI 1.18-6.16] and 1 .95 [1.25-3.03]). Only girls belonging to the CS duration trajectory (i.e. , 11 hr 30 min/night up to 3 years and about 10 hr 30 min to 11 hr/night thereafter) showed increased probability of hyperactivity -inattention score at age 5 -6 years (aOR 2.79 [1.09-7.17]). The prevalence of reported hyperactivity -inattention is lower in girls than boys (20.4% vs 32.0%), so the lack of association s observed between the shorter sleep duration trajectories (SS and MLS ) and hyperactivity -inattention in this group may result from low statistical power rather than true sex differences. This hypothesis is supported by the OR s being quite close for both 14 sexes . Howe ver, the association between the CS duration trajectory and hyperactivity - inattention is specific to girls. Hence, for girls, the observed effect seems linked to the abrupt decrease in sleep duration between age 2 and 3 years , but whether there is also a role of prolonged short sleep duration throughout the preschool years is unclear . Observed differences between boys and girls could be due to rating scales and some lab tests showing that girls have a lower base level of hyperactivity -inattention than do boys, and thus, \"they have to deviate farther from sex peers than do boys to attain a \"diagnostic\" level of problems\" (Arnold, 1996) (page 559) . Also, girls with ADHD are seemingly less diagnosed than are boys (Mowlem et al., 2019) . One of the explanation s proposed by Quinn and Madhoo (2014) is that girls with ADHD more often show the inattentive form of ADHD than do boys, which can be perceived as less problematic as compared with disruptive be havior . In addition, parental evaluation and report s could differ depending on the child 's sex . Indeed, girls are less likely to be referred to specialized medical centers for ADHD than are boys. This difference was partly explained by parents believ ing that learning assistance is less effective for girls than boys with ADHD (Ohan et al. , 2009) . The main strength of this study was the use of the trajectory -modeling method to take into account the longitudinal aspects of sleep rather than a single time point. Also, by taking into account baseline behavior, we could show a temporality in the association between sleep duration and hyperactivity -inattention problems . Of note , the result s do not discount the possibility of remaining reverse association s (i.e., pre-existing behavioral difficulties before age 2 years and subsequent short sleep duration ) (Gruber, 2014; Sadeh, 2007; Touchette et al., 2009) nor the possibility for sleep to be an inherent trait of external behavior problems such as ADHD (Bijlenga et al., 2019) . The rationale for using group -based trajectory modeling is that although classical longitudinal studies (analyzing the association between a given exposure and an ulterior outcome ) allow for establish ing the temporality of the association, they are not 15 optimal for the study of repeated measures, because they consider only one time of exposure per analysis. Repeating the analysis for each time p oint is feasible, but the evolution of the exposure through time is not taken into account ; thus, for each given time point , a transient exposure is considered e quivalent to a long -lasting one. Here we use d a data -driven strategy that allows for identifying several groups of children with similar patterns that could be potential specific target s for counseling and prevention. Confounding bias was limited with the inclusion of a wide range of covariates, established from a systematic review of the literature (Reynaud et al., 2018) combined with a preliminary analysis. Structural equation modeling has also been used to study repeated measures of sleep associated with behavioral difficulties . In the Williams et al . study (2017) , which included more than 4000 children assessed at five time points from age 0-1 year to 8-9 years, behavioral sleep problems were consistent ly associated with increased emotional dysregulation 2 years later and vice versa . In the Mindell et al . study (2017) , structural equation modeling indicated that sleep (defined by a latent variable composed of sleep duration and bed time) at 12 months was associated with internalizing behavior at age 18 months . However the reverse association (pre-existing internalizing behavior and later sleep difficulties) was not found. Several limitation s of this study should be noted. The first is the subjectiv e aspects of the measures. Parents r eported time in bed duration , which possibly led to an overestimation of the real night -sleep duration . Assessment of t he child's behavior involved the parental version of the SDQ , which has good external validation (Croft et al., 2015; Shojaei et al., 2009) and detection power for internalizing and externalizing behavior (Goodman & Scott, 1999) . Confounding factors were also subjectively assessed, so some of the confounding effect still remain ed in the analyses . Another limitation is the relatively small sample size , which allow ed for the required statistical power to investigate our main hypothesis but not the sex 16 specificity. Also, the sample is not representative of the general French population because of the initial recruitment (mainly urban and based on voluntary participation) and also attrit ion (classica lly, women with more education and income were more likely to remain in the study) . This limits the generalization of the results. Finally , the role of chronotype could not be investigated because it was not measured in the cohort. This would have been of interest because chronotype may have a prepondera nt role in school -aged children , with evening chrono types show ing increased risk for behavioral problems (van der Heijden et al., 20 13). An etiological hypothesis for the longitudinal association between sleep and hyperactivity - inattention is that sleep regulate s synaptic homeostasis, so lack of sleep could reduce synaptic plasticity (Tononi & Cirelli, 20 14) and have behavioral repercussion s such as reduced capacity to adapt to the environment (Kolb & Gibb, 2014) . Also, brain maturation and synaptic plasticity related to sleep may differ by sex in typically developing infants and children (Franco et al., 2020) . This study, combined with previous literature on the topic , brings additional knowledge regarding predictors of hyperactivity -inattention in early childhood, which is especially important since they are predictive of academic under -achievement at age 12 (Salla et al., 2016) . We need a better understanding of the etiology of behavioral difficulties to improve medical care in this regard and better target prevention programs . Although some sleep intervention program s have shown promising results for reducing ADHD symptoms (Hiscock et al., 2015) , current review s of treatment strateg ies do not mention sleep as a non - pharmacological option (Caye et al., 2019) . In conclusion, n ight-sleep duration trajectories in early years are positively associated with hyperactivity -inattention problems at school start but not with other behavioral features . In our sample , associations were sex -dependent, but additional studies are needed to confirm these results . 17 Acknowledgments We thank the EDEN mother -child cohort study group (I.
