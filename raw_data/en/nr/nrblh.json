Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [lim-FO-muh] is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells in your child's lymphatic system. The lymphatic [lim-FAT-ik] system is part of your child's immune system, which helps your child's body fight disease and infection. Additionally, the lymphatic system also helps move fluids around the body. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma starts in the lymphatic system and creates tumors from lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. There are 2 main types of lymphocytes: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can happen in either lymphocyte, but B-cell lymphomas tend to be more common in the U.S. Although non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not common in children, it still happens sometimes. Both non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma are more common in adults, but can still happen in children and teens. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a very rare kind of cancer of the lymphatic system. Children with Hodgkin lymphoma have cells in their lymphatic system that undergo a DNA change and start to grow and multiply when they shouldn't. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tends to affect younger children, while Hodgkin's lymphoma is more likely to be found in older children and teens. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, as with most other cancers, is when cells in your child's body begin to grow out of control. Almost any type of cell in your child's body can become cancer. Although not always, sometimes these cells can spread to other parts of your child's body. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can start anywhere there is lymph tissue, including in the: Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can spread or grow at different rates, based on the type your child may have. The different types are: Although most lymphomas will fall into 1 of the 2 types above, sometimes they fall in the middle or grow slower or faster. The lymphatic system runs throughout the whole body, so non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can start anywhere. The place where it starts or spreads will affect the types of symptoms your child may have. Some of the most common symptoms are: See your child's doctor right away if your child has any of the symptoms of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This type of cancer can spread to other parts of the body, like the brain, liver, or bone marrow. Your child's doctor can help you figure out if your child has non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and if so, your child's doctor can help you create a treatment plan to help prevent it from spreading. The exact cause of childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is unknown. Scientists have found that there may be a few risk factors, such as problems with the immune system, although not all children that have this type of cancer have these problems. Other risk factors may include: Generally, the symptoms that are linked to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can also have other causes, so your doctor might call for other tests to find out if non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or some other problem is causing these symptoms in your child. If your doctor finds that your child has lymphoma, more tests will be performed to find out what kind of lymphoma it is, and how it should be treated. It's important to get your child into the doctor as early as you can if your child has any of these symptoms so that your doctor can help you figure out the cause of the symptoms, and help you make a treatment plan if needed. If your doctor thinks your child might have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, they may diagnose the condition after: Childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is usually treated by a pediatric oncologist, although there may be several other doctors and specialists on your child's care team, depending on the nature and severity of your child's cancer. Some treatment options include: As the real cause of childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is not known at this time, there are known ways to prevent the disease. Most children and adults with this type of cancer have few, if any, risk factors that can be changed.
