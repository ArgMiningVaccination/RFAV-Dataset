By balancing the energetic channels we are able to promote your body's natural homeostasis and engage its natural healing capabilities. Acupuncture treats things such as stress, mood disorders, pain, digestive issues, sleep disorders, endocrine issues, and nervous system issues to name just a few. Insertion of needles is very gentle and promotes a strong feeling of wellbeing. Body Work [Read More](2-description) As a Doctor of Acupuncture and Chinese Medicine, one of the scopes of my practice is body work. I am trained in Tui Na massage which stimulates the flow of Qi in the body through manual manipulation to promote balance and harmony. Fire cupping is a major component of body work which involves putting glass cups on the body to allow free flow of energy in the body. Cupping helps with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation, and overall wellbeing. Herbal Consult [Read More](3-description) Herbal Medicine is another pillar of treatment here at Ritual Medicine and a great tool both in addition to acupuncture or on its own! Chinese Herbalism, like acupuncture, seeks to treat the entire human being and root of the disorder, not just the symptoms or diseases that come up. Through this holistic manner of treatment, we are often able to treat several problem symptoms by focusing on your core imbalances. Herbal Medicine comes in several different forms such as tea, raw herbs to be cooked, tinctures, pills or powders. Let us know what works best for you as we are here to individualize your care to your specific wants/needs. Herbs will be given to you post session with complete instructions or mailed to you very shortly. Available in person or online! Lifestyle/Spiritual Coaching [Read More](4-description) Here at Ritual Medicine, we understand that life gets bumpy sometimes. Traditional therapy, while very helpful, can at times ignore the connection of the mind-body-spirit. We are here to honor that connection and you as you flow through life's difficulties. In these sessions we will use techniques such as breath work, behavioral therapies, visualization, intuitive readings, Qi gong, meditation, and holistic life coaching to work through your specific issues. Dr. Allison Blacutt's past experience is in therapy and psychology and is still a passion point for her to work with. The connection that can be cultivated in these sessions and the energy we move through together is incredibly powerful. Let us hold space for you to move forward in the strongest way possible. Available in person and online! Facial Rejuvenation Acupuncture [Read More](5-description) Facial Rejuvenation acupuncture helps promote your body's natural anti aging processes and leaves you with glowing, brighter, youthful skin. Needles both in the face and in the body help to stimulate your lymphatic and circulatory systems which work together to bring oxygen and nutrients to your skin. Needles also promote your body's natural ability to produce collagen which helps keep the skin plump and reduces fine lines and wrinkles. The result is completely nourished skin from the inside out! Look great and feel even better!
