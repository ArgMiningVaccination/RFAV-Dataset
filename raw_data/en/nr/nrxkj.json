HPV impacts about 13 million people each year in the U.S. including teens, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [[1]](#footnote_1). An effective way to protect your kids from HPV and related cancers is the HPV vaccine, which is generally available to kids ages 11 to 12. Here's what you need to know about the HPV vaccine including when to get it, how it protects kids and potential adverse effects. What Is HPV? HPV is a group of viruses that causes abnormal tissue growth and cell changes. HPV is spread through skin-to-skin contact with an infected individual, such as vaginal, anal and oral sex. HPV is so common that the CDC says nearly everyone will get infected at some point in their lives. Nine out of 10 infections go away on their own within two years [[2]](#footnote_2). In other cases, HPV can cause genital warts. These bumps can be small or large, raised or flat or cauliflower-shaped. For 36,000 men and women in the U.S. each year, HPV leads to cancer, per the CDC [[3]](#footnote_3). HPV can lead to cancer in several parts of the body including: - Cervix, vagina and vulva - Penis - Anus in both men and women - Back of the throat and base of the tongue and tonsils in both men and women \"Despite its popular association with cervical cancer, this sexually transmitted virus can actually affect anyone, regardless of gender or age,\" says Christina Johns, M.D., a pediatric emergency care physician and senior medical advisor at PM Pediatric Care. Besides genital warts, there are no symptoms of HPV. Detecting HPV without symptoms requires an HPV test and/or a Pap test which screens cervical cells for signs of cancer in folks with a cervix. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends a Pap test every three years for women ages 21 to 29 and an HPV test (with or without a Pap test) every five years or a Pap test every three years for women ages 30 to 65. More frequent screening or screening beyond age 65 is recommended for women with certain risk factors, such as being immunosuppressed. Screening should still be performed if you have received the HPV vaccine. There is no approved HPV test for those without a cervix nor a screening recommendation, although you may be able to receive an anal Pap test if you are at risk of anal cancer, according to the CDC. What Does the HPV Vaccine Do? The HPV vaccine prevents infection with certain types of HPV that can cause precancers, cancers and genital warts. The HPV vaccine was first used in the U.S. in 2006. Since then, cases of cancers and genital warts caused by HPV infections have dropped 88% in teen girls, and cervical precancers (abnormal cells on the cervix) caused by HPV have dropped 40% in vaccinated women [[4]](#footnote_4). Who Needs the HPV Vaccine? The HPV vaccine is recommended for everyone, male and female, ages 9 to 26 years old, per the CDC. Vaccination typically starts at ages 11 to 12, although it can be given as young as 9 years old. At that age, \"younger children have a better, more robust immune response to the vaccine\" and \"reap the most benefit,\" says Dr. Johns. \"Waiting until 11 or 12 years old may miss the window where we can prevent the virus before exposure,\" adds Jonathan Miller, M.D., medical director of value-based care and chief of primary care at Nemours Children's Health in Delaware. The HPV vaccine schedule typically involves two doses taken six to 12 months apart. Unvaccinated teens who are already 15 years or older require three doses given over a period of six months. The CDC does not recommend the vaccine for those older than 26 years. Past the age of 26, it's likely you have already been exposed to HPV and vaccination after that doesn't have the same effect. Adults over 26 can still consult with a doctor about the potential benefits of getting vaccinated. Why Is the HPV Vaccine Recommended for Ages 9-12? The goal of the HPV vaccine is to protect kids before they are ever exposed to or infected by the virus through sexual activity. A 2016-2017 survey found that about 40% of U.S. high school students have had sexual intercourse, so administering the vaccine before then is the strongest protection against HPV [[5]](#footnote_5). Studies have concluded that the HPV vaccine is not linked to sexual activity in younger ages or increased incidences of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). \"Younger children have robust immune systems, which generate more antibodies in the response to the HPV vaccine than older individuals,\" adds Alok Patel, M.D., a pediatric hospitalist at Stanford Medicine Children's Health. Dr. Johns notes that \"from a practical point of view, there are several other booster shots that are commonly administered at this age, so it makes sense to get the HPV vaccine along with them.\" Getting the HPV vaccine at 11 or 12 years old \"is the safest and easiest option for all children,\" since children require three doses past the age of 15, she says. Does the HPV Vaccine Have Risks or Side Effects? The CDC, as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), stresses the safety and efficacy of the HPV vaccine. Common side effects are those typical of many vaccines such as: - Pain, redness and swelling at the injection site - Headache - Nausea Dizziness and/or fainting is common in adolescents after any vaccination, per the CDC. Because of this, it's recommended for the child to receive the vaccine sitting or lying down and to remain that way for 15 minutes afterwards. \"As always, parents should be encouraged to ask any and all questions about vaccine safety to a trusted health care professional,\" says Dr. Patel. The HPV vaccine poses a risk of adverse effects for certain populations, including: - People who are allergic to yeast - Those who have had a life-threatening allergic reaction to any previous dose of the HPV vaccine - Those who are moderately or severely ill Tell your doctor about any allergies before receiving the HPV vaccine, as an allergy to any ingredient of the vaccine may cause an anaphylactic (serious, potentially life-threatening) allergic reaction. The HPV vaccine is safe for children with mild illness, such as low-grade fever, runny nose or cough, per the CDC. The HPV vaccine is not recommended for pregnant people, as the vaccine has not been clinically tested in that population. Is the HPV Vaccine Required for School? As of publication, Hawai'i, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington, D.C. are the only U.S. jurisdictions to require the HPV vaccination for students, although doctors hope for more widespread uptake. \"The most powerful lever we have to promote HPV vaccine uptake is to require it for school entry as we do for many other vaccines,\" says Dr. Miller. \"Because HPV is spread so readily between adolescents, a school mandate is an important public health measure to protect our children.\" \"The HPV vaccine is safe and has tremendous benefit with regard to cancer prevention,\" says Dr. Johns. \"It saves lives.\" Does My Child Need the HPV Vaccine? In all likelihood, yes, your child needs the HPV vaccine to protect them from cancer later on. \"We know children benefit from our focus on preventative medicine,\" says Dr. Miller. \"The HPV vaccine is a perfect example of how we can impact children today, so they grow up to be healthier adults.\" Looking For Affordable And Accessible HealthCare?
