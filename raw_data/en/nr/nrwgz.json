In the United States, there is no licensure or regulations of who can call themselves an \"herbalist\" or who can practice using that title. It is extremely important to do your research and feel comfortable with your herbalist's level of training. Some herbalists can attend weekend seminars or brief certificate programs and begin practicing with little actual clinical experience. Most clinical herbalists practicing in a professional setting will have gone through an accredited program of herbal studies with supervised practice and proper examination. Such programs include the Maryland University of Integrative Health (graduate-level accredited program) or Bastyr University (undergraduate level accredited program).So, some herbalists have extensive knowledge of the medicinal potential of botanical medicines and a solid understanding of human physiology and pathophysiology. This allows them to provide holistic, custom and individualized support for illness. Herbal medicine is an integral part of a licensed naturopathic doctor's training and career. Naturopathic doctors are licensed and regulated in 22 states as well as Washington, DC, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Our naturopathic doctors at Richmond Natural Medicine hold active licenses which means that they've completed 4-year naturopathic medical programs with extensive clinical training, passed rigorous board examinations and maintain ongoing continuing education work. They use herbal medicine as one of their tools to support their patient's health. What sets them apart from a clinical herbalist is the depth of the study in the medical sciences (including human physiology and disease processes) as well as their background in other natural medicine tools (including lifestyle changes, clinical nutrition and homeopathy). Tailored herbal medicine support is only one part of a naturopathic doctor's care plan. Is herbal medicine safe? Yes - when administered properly. Herbs (plant/botanical medicines) have a profound effect on the human body. Comprised of thousands of medicinal constituents, herbs can affect multiple body systems in targeted ways while also working synergistically with the body for a holistic treatment approach - herbal medicine comes with minimal to no side effects in the process. Is herbal medicine really effective? Effectiveness of herbal preparations is directly linked to appropriate dosing, frequency and choice of herb. This is why it is so important to work in partnership with a licensed naturopathic doctor to be given appropriate dosing information and to have herbs custom selected or compounded for you in a very tailored way. The main reason you hear of herbs not working is due to inappropriate dosing or using the incorrect herb for the illness. How is herbal medicine different from modern-day pharmaceuticals? When using herbs as medicine, you are employing the entire plant (root, flower, leaf, rhizome, etc) which consists of a multitude of medicinal components capable of impacting multiple pathways in the body. Pharmaceuticals are manufactured to contain one specific compound. While pharmaceuticals are often aimed at one specific health goal, they impact multiple body systems - thus we see adverse side effects. Herbal medicines were not created for your specific diseases and illnesses, therefore there is no herb to \"treat arthritis\" or to \"treat IBS.\" Herbs, when combined together in a custom compounded form, can be remarkably effective in providing full-body treatment that is not just symptom specific. Herbal medicines do not have extensive side effect profiles as pharmaceuticals do. Can I take herbal formulas in place of my medications? It can be very dangerous to abruptly discontinue pharmaceuticals and extremely difficult for a lay person to choose an acceptable alternative(s) to their treatment. Our naturopathic doctors require patients consult with their prescribing physician(s) regarding any changes to their medications. We are often able to support patients who are seeking to reduce their pharmaceutical use - this is a process and safety is most important. What about all the conflicting information I find on the internet about herbal remedies? I'm afraid to try anything! There is a great deal of conflicting information on the internet and little or no regulation of what is posted there. Some medical journals may offer reliable information, but the best course of action is to consult with a qualified herbal medicine practitioner or naturopathic doctor for accurate information that's applicable to you as an individual. That said our naturopathic doctors love empowering their patients to use herbal medicine at home in their day-to-day lives - it's both incredibly simple and amazingly complex!
