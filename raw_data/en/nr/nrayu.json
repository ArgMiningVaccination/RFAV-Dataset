The formal recommendation was approved by HBF's Scientific and Medical Advisory Board to achieve the World Health Organization's (WHO) ambitious goal of eliminating hepatitis B by the year 2030. Up to 2.2 million Americans, and more than 292 million people worldwide, are chronically infected with this serious virus of the liver, which can lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Because there are often few symptoms, hepatitis B frequently goes undiagnosed, with experts estimating that only 20-30% are aware of their infection. \"We have made the recommendation to test all adults for hepatitis B because we believe it is the only way to identify those who need care and reduce deaths due to hepatitis B infection,\" explained Timothy Block, PhD, President of the Hepatitis B Foundation and its Baruch S. Blumberg Institute. \"Current guidelines recommend testing for people in high risk populations, but data suggests that up to 40% of those infected may not fall within those populations. It is imperative that we test everyone in order to provide care and education that will reduce deaths from hepatitis B.\" This recommendation is a bold shift from the current hepatitis B risk-based screening guidelines published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). But multiple challenges, including the complexity of risk-based screening, and stigma surrounding hepatitis B, have led to a lack of adherence of the current guidelines, and there has not been a significant increase in hepatitis B testing in the U.S. HBF's recommendation is limited to adults, because universal infant vaccination has been standard in the U.S. since 1991. The new recommendation includes the provision that individuals who test negative for hepatitis B in the screening and have not been vaccinated, be offered and receive an effective hepatitis B vaccine.

The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices' (ACIP) voted in February to unanimously recommend HEPLISAV-B for use among individuals age 18 years and older to prevent hepatitis B infection (HBV). The Hepatitis B Foundation welcomes the use of the new vaccine, which can be completed in two doses and is expected to increase immunization rates for adults in the United States. HEPLISAV-B was approved for use by the FDA on July 28, 2017. It is the first new hepatitis B vaccine in more than 25 years, and the only two dose vaccine for the prevention of infection. Previous vaccines for hepatitis B require three doses over the course of six months to protect against this deadly liver infection, and vaccination initiatives have shown that as few as 13% of people who receive the first dose of the vaccine complete the final dose. According to Kate Moraras, Senior Program Director of the Hepatitis B Foundation, who provided public testimony at February's ACIP meeting, \"Vaccination is a critical tool towards eliminating hepatitis B, but in the U.S. only 25% of adults are vaccinated. Having a new 2-dose vaccine can help to greatly increase vaccine coverage, especially among those at high-risk for infection, such as people with diabetes and HIV-infected individuals.\" Binh Ly, a hepatitis B advocate and #justB storyteller from Washington. D.C., also provided testimony at the ACIP meeting, stating that \"the availability of a two-dose vaccine over 1 month instead of being given as 3 doses over 6 months is a critical tool to protect many more Americans - this is one less barrier for vulnerable and at-risk communities to receive necessary protection.\" Baruch S.

While increased vaccination rates can reduce the number of new cases, \"the only way to achieve the WHO goal is to identify those with a chronic infection, by screening, and then linking them with care,\" said Chari Cohen, DrPH, MPH, Vice President for Public Health and Programs, at the Hepatitis B Foundation. \"Testing based only on risk factors has failed to identify over a million infected individuals,\" Cohen said. \"It is time to move forward with universal testing to make this effort most effective and most efficient.\"While there is still no cure for chronic hepatitis B, current medications work by lowering the amount of virus in the blood, which in turn reduces damage to the liver. Effective treatment has been shown to reduce death from liver disease by 50-70% in those with chronic infection. In addition, there are many drugs currently in development that could provide even more effective treatment or a cure in the future. However, it is estimated that fewer than 7% of Americans with chronic hepatitis B are currently receiving treatment. \"It is absolutely within our power to reduce deaths due to hepatitis B,\" said Robert Gish, MD, HBF Medical Director. \"But it will only be possible if we identify everyone who needs treatment and help them find care they can afford.\" Vietnam has one of the highest rates of viral hepatitis in Asia, with an estimated 8.6 million Vietnamese chronically infected with hepatitis B, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2016, the Hepatitis B Foundation partnered with the Vietnam Viral Hepatitis Alliance (V-VHA), established and led by Doan Dao, MD, to launch a pilot hepatitis B screening and care program in Ho Chi Minh City. The goals of the program were to determine the prevalence of hepatitis B, develop a model for linkage to care, and impact national policy on prevention and protection of health care providers from viral hepatitis. V-VHA also supports a public health education and awareness program throughout Vietnam. The initiative achieved outstanding results in just one year. In the first six months of 2016, V-VHA screened 1,000 individuals, connecting infected individuals to a network of care, and helping those who were uninfected to complete the three-dose vaccine series. The pilot's success helped V-VHA to build partnerships and develop a model to continue and expand the project to reach more people in the community. In 2017, V-VHA was given an international NGO status by Vietnam's Department of State, and was recognized by Vietnam's General Department of Preventive Medicine and WHO-Vietnam. Their program has grown to include ongoing screenings and linkage to care, a new pilot program to screen health care providers in hospital settings, and a monthlong hepatitis awareness campaign during Hepatitis Awareness Month in July. HBF is proud to be a partner of this international effort, which involves HBF medical director Robert Gish, MD, who serves on the board of V-VHA and has been a driving force to address the problem of hepatitis B in Vietnam for almost a decade.

U.S. Representative Grace Meng (D-6th CD, Queens), the keynote speaker, stated that \"hepatitis B is a major health issue that disproportionately impacts Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI).\" Meng added that \"the virus can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer if left untreated. That is why it's critical for AAPI communities to become more aware of hepatitis B, and the importance of getting tested.\" Ms. Meng, who co-chairs the Congressional Hepatitis Caucus, pointed out that her congressional district is 42% Asian American and in Flushing, Asian Americans make up 67% (48,500) of her constituents. \"I am deeply concerned that most people living with chronic hepatitis B are not aware that they have this life-threatening infection, and most of those who have been diagnosed are not being treated\" said Meng. Dr. Ann Winters, Medical Director of the Viral Hepatitis Program at New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said that the department is working to ensure that all New Yorkers at risk are screened for hepatitis B, including the uninsured. The Hepatitis B Forum in Flushing was opened by Chari Cohen, DrPH, MPH, HBF's vice president for public health, who cited statistics about chronic hepatitis B affecting 2.2 million Americans and 292 million people worldwide, leading to nearly 800,000 deaths each year, primarily from liver cancer\u2014the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. \"Increased awareness and advocacy for a cure are necessary if we hope to eliminate hepatitis B,\" said Dr. Cohen.32nd International Molecular Biology of Hepatitis B Virus Meeting Held in Washington DC Hepatitis B Foundation Joins Forces with Grace Meng and NYC Hep B Coalition to Promote Awareness in Asian American Community The International HBV Meeting was held September 3-7, 2017, with more than 550 scientists from 36 countries meeting in Washington DC to discuss the latest research progress in hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis delta (HDV). This was the largest turnout ever for the meeting in the US. The 2017 meeting, co-chaired by Drs. Anna Kramvis (U Witwatersrand, SA) and T . Jake Liang (NIH, USA), was administratively coordinated by The Hepatitis B Foundation (HBF). The meeting remains the only international conference dedicated to HBV molecular biology and is considered the definitive meeting on the subject. The meeting is characterized by presentations, given by senior and junior scientists, including trainees, with plenty of room for vigorous discussion. This year, there was a special satellite conference focusing on HBV therapeutics (Novel HBV Antiviral or Immune Modulatory therapies in Late Pre-Clinical/Clinical Development), which was also organized by the meeting organizers and HBF, and co-chaired by Dr. Anna Lok (University of Michigan) and Dr. Marc Ghany (National Institutes of Health). The satellite symposia brought clinicians and those involved in the clinical phases of therapeutic drug discovery together with the basic scientists. The scientific quality of the work presented was notable, with many novel and innovative findings presented, as a result of the improvement in the systems used to study HBV and HDV. This year, the meeting organizers conferred the inaugural \"Distinguished Award in Hepatitis B Research\" to Francis Chisari, MD, of the Scripps Institute, La Jolla, CA. Dr. Chisari's research focuses on the immunovirology of chronic hepatitis B and C and Professor Chisari is considered to be a founding scientist of the field. The meeting organizers plan to recognize an outstanding scientist with this award at each future meeting. There are still many outstanding scientists to recognize, and we all expect that among the current trainees there are future Frank Chisaris, who will make seminal contributions to the field in the future. The first International HBV Meeting was held in 1985 in Cold Spring Harbor, USA and was organized by Drs. Harold Varmus and Jesse Summers. Today, the meeting annually elects new academic co-chairs and rotates between North America, Europe, and Asia, with the Hepatitis B Foundation as the official sponsor of this important scientific meeting.2018 Bruce Witte Distinguished Lecturer Dennis Liotta, PhD, Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Chemistry and Executive Director Emory Institute for Drug Development (center) delivered the HBF's 2018 Bruce Witte Distinguished Lecture on the role of the immune system in hepatitis B infection on May 3, 2018.

The #justB campaign now includes 22 stories that highlight the personal experiences of people from across the United States who have been affected by hepatitis B, with the goals of increasing awareness of hepatitis B and its role in causing liver failure and liver cancer, decreasing stigma and discrimination associated with the disease, promoting testing and vaccination, and supporting the Foundation's advocacy efforts to increase federal funding for improved access to care and more research to find a cure. Since the campaign launched in May 2017, the #justB videos have collected more than 9,600 YouTube views and 10,300 Facebook views . Storytellers who participated in last year's workshops have remained actively engaged in hepatitis B advocacy and outreach in their communities, and several have had the opportunity to share their stories in local and national media, at Congressional issue briefings in Washington, DC, at awareness events, and on webinars. Each #justB story reflects a unique personal experience and an important message about hepatitis B. The stories share messages of hope and encouragement, while still highlighting serious issues that hepatitis B patients and family members experience, including language barriers, misconceptions about how the virus is spread, fear of discrimination, lack of access to affordable care, and the risk of mother-to- child transmission. The new videos also add four additional languages to the #justB story bank, with stories that will be available to watch in Cantonese, Khmer, Twi, and Yoruba.

The atmosphere was full of blessings and congratulations. Three months later, everything collapsed. I took a blood test - I thought I needed it to get a U.S. visa. I learned I have hepatitis B. I was sure this meant I could not join my husband. I barely remember riding home on my motorbike. My eyes blurred, and my soul went out. Other drivers yelled at me, but I didn't hear them. When I gave my mom the test result, she could not read it, but she knew from the look on my face that something was wrong. She put her hand on my shoulder and said, \"Honey, it's okay. We never know when we will die... you might live longer than people without this virus.\" I didn't believe her at first. One night, there was a funeral nearby, and there was a black out. I was afraid of the darkness, so I lit a candle. I listened to the sad music and felt like I was the flame: the wax would melt, and my life would end due to hepatitis B. When my fianc\u00e9 called, I was scared to answer. But I told him the truth. He said, \"I love you,\" and encouraged me to see a doctor. The first one told me I needed treatment costing a thousand U.S. dollars a month. Too expensive! But a second doctor said, \"You just need to monitor the virus carefully.\" So I threw away all negative thoughts! I wrote \"CHANGE\" in big letters and put it on the wall. I researched how to protect my family and my lover from hepatitis B. And a year later, I got my visa! Now, I am pregnant. I'm talking with my doctor about how to make sure my beloved baby won't get the virus. I have transformed myself from survivor to helper. Hepatitis B does not haunt me anymore.
