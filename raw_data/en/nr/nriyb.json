With a belief in the need to encompass the emotional, energetic, and spiritual aspects of healing, our mission is to empower each guest to bridge the gap between mind, body, and spirit and become more fully embodied, integrated, and connected versions of themselves. We believe in expanding the definition of what healing looks like. Working with the Amazonian plant medicine ayahuasca under the guidance of indigenous Peruvian Shipibo healers, we collaborate with clinical psychologists who have extensive plant medicine experience to support a uniquely integrative approach to healing. Join Our Community \"Soltara\" comes from the Spanish verb \"soltar\" which means to let go or release. At our seaside haven in the mountainous tropical forest of Costa Rica, we've created a framework for you to dig deep, uncover the energetic roots of blockages, self-limiting beliefs, and negative programs that may be holding you back, and help you fully release them and step into your power. Plant medicines such as ayahuasca, and other holistic therapies, ask us to connect to all parts of ourselves, and if there are painful parts, to confront them directly: they are speaking to us and want to teach us something. By shining the light of consciousness into the shadowed corners of our psyche, we are able to acknowledge, learn from, and release the suffering attached to them. Our highly skilled, gentle, loving Shipibo healers and facilitators will help guide you through this process of self-discovery through plant medicine healing, supportive holistic modalities, and modern psychotherapeutic practices. Our Call To Service Ayahuasca Retreats Under the guidance of indigenous Peruvian Shipibo healers, we combine plant medicine ceremony, supportive embodiment practices, and a unique integration program to empower each guest in their healing over the long term. Our decades of combined experience holding ceremony and doing medicine work allow you to experience in-depth healing in a safe and loving environment. Immersed in the tropical forest and with stunning ocean views, we offer retreats of varying lengths, along with retreats featuring special guests, allowing you to find what works for you in order to step fully into your authentic self. [View Available Retreats](https://soltara.co/retreats) Integration Program Integration means taking the knowledge and lessons learned during your ceremony experience and putting it into practice in your life. At Soltara, there is a strong focus on the integrative work that starts during your retreat and continues, possibly, for the rest of your life. We work with skilled integration specialists who have a foot in both Western and traditional medicine and can help you prepare for, maintain, and enhance the outcomes of the retreat experience. By doing the necessary healing work during your stay and understanding the tools and practices that can help maintain that work, you can open to the truth of who you are, what you want, and most importantly, how to get there.
