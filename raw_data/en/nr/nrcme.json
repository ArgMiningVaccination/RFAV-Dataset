Materials and Methods A total of 204 patients with erectile dysfunction who completed a questionnaire between January and June 2005 were evaluated. The questionnaire was composed of 13 questions. This survey employed a broad definition for CAM, including acupuncture, biofeedback, folk remedies, chiropractic, homeopathy, hypnosis, massage, psychotherapy, relaxation, energy healing, imagery, special diet, spiritual healing and herbal medicine. The CAMs used by the patients with erectile dysfunction were divided into processed health foods, natural health foods and other therapies, and these were all analyzed. Results The mean age was 57.9\u00b110.1 years. 78 of the total patients with erectile dysfunction had employed at least one CAM. CAM users were more likely to be high school educated, nonsmokers and exercisers. The CAMs used were processed health foods 62% (48/78), natural health foods 15% (12/78), and other therapies 66% (52/78). The processed health foods were soy 25%, ginseng 23% and mushroom 19%. Of the natural health foods, tomato was 42%, soy was 25% and ginseng was 17%. Of the other therapies, herbal medicine was 45%, acupuncture was 25%, moxibustion and cupping a boil were 17%. 35% (27/78) of the patients with erectile dysfunction had employed more than one of the processed health foods, natural health foods and other therapies.
