Diarrhea can be triggered by many different conditions. Acute diarrhea is often caused by an infection and may require medical management. The primary role of nutrition in acute diarrhea is to prevent depletion of fluid, sodium, [ potassium ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2898000#hn-2898000-uses), and calories. Replenishment of all four has been achieved with \"rehydration solutions\" and with a variety of foods, from salted carrot soup to peeled scraped apple to rice gruel. However, diarrhea severe enough to necessitate the use of rehydration solutions requires direct medical supervision. Therefore, nutritional approaches to overcoming depletion of fluid, sodium, potassium, and calories are not discussed here, but rather should be discussed with a doctor. Diarrhea-induced [ low blood sugar ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1034003#hn-1034003-need-to-know), dehydration, or electrolyte imbalance can be serious or even life-threatening, particularly if prolonged in children. A healthcare provider should be consulted if diarrhea continues for more than a few days, as it may indicate a more serious health condition. Diarrhea alternating with constipation may be a sign of [ irritable bowel syndrome ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-1226001#hn-1226001-need-to-know) (IBS). Symptoms Normal bowel habits vary considerably from person to person depending on age, diet, cultural factors, and individual physiology. However, loose watery stools occurring three or more times in one day is generally considered abnormal. In some instances, diarrhea may be accompanied by cramping abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, loss of appetite, and bloody or foul-smelling stools. Holistic Options Other integrative approaches that may be helpful: [ Acupuncture ](topic.jhtml?docId=hn-2936000#hn-2936000-001) may be useful for the treatment of diarrhea, particularly in infants. A preliminary study of acupuncture treatment in 1,050 cases of infantile diarrhea found 95% were relieved with one to three treatments.1 Similar results have been reported in other preliminary trials2 , 3 and case reports.4 , 5 A controlled trial of acupuncture for the treatment of infantile diarrhea compared scalp acupuncture or traditional body acupuncture with drug therapy, primarily antibiotics. The cure rate for scalp and body acupuncture was significantly higher (90% and 89%) than that of drug treatment (46%).6 [] Eating Right The right diet is the key to managing many diseases and to improving general quality of life. For this condition, scientific research has found benefit in the following healthy eating tips. |Recommendation||Why| |If you're lactose intolerant, avoid milk products|| | People whose diarrhea is caused by lactose intolerance can avoid the problem by steering clear of milk and ice cream or by taking lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose. People who are |Try the BRAT diet|| | Some doctors recommend the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, apples, and toast) for acute bouts of diarrhea. These foods are mild, well-tolerated, and good sources of helpful nutrients. Some doctors recommend a diet called the BRAT diet for acute bouts of diarrhea. BRAT stands for bananas, rice, apples and toast. These foods are mild, well-tolerated and good sources of fiber, potassium and other nutrients that may be helpful in diarrhea. The efficacy of this diet has not been evaluated in clinical trials. |Cut down on coffee|| | Drinking several cups of coffee per day causes diarrhea in some people. Avoiding all coffee for a few days should help determine whether coffee is the culprit. Drinking several cups of coffee per day causes diarrhea in some people. People with chronic diarrhea who drink coffee should avoid all coffee for a few days to evaluate whether coffee is the culprit. |Look at your supplements|| | Large amounts of vitamin C or magnesium found in supplements can also cause diarrhea, avoiding the offending supplement brings rapid relief. Large amounts of |Uncover your food allergies|| | Allergies and food sensitivities are common triggers for diarrhea. People with chronic diarrhea not attributable to other causes should discuss the possibility of food sensitivity with a doctor. |Watch for certain sugars|| | Avoid fructose in fruit juices such as apple juice and pear juice, and in soft drinks and desserts. Also avoid sorbitol in dietetic sweets. These sugars may be poorly absorbed, sometimes leading to diarrhea. Some foods contain sugars that are absorbed slowly, such as fructose in fruit juice or sorbitol in dietetic confectionery. Through a process called osmosis, these unabsorbed sugars hold onto water in the intestines, sometimes leading to diarrhea. By reading labels, people with chronic non-infectious diarrhea can easily avoid fruit juice, fructose, and sorbitol to see if this eliminates the problem. [] Supplements [What Are Star Ratings?](#HwStarRatingExplanationWrapper) Our proprietary \"Star-Rating\" system was developed to help you easily understand the amount of scientific support behind each supplement in relation to a specific health condition. While there is no way to predict whether a vitamin, mineral, or herb will successfully treat or prevent associated health conditions, our unique ratings tell you how well these supplements are understood by some in the medical community, and whether studies have found them to be effective for other people. For over a decade, our team has combed through thousands of research articles published in reputable journals. To help you make educated decisions, and to better understand controversial or confusing supplements, our medical experts have digested the science into these three easy-to-follow ratings. We hope this provides you with a helpful resource to make informed decisions towards your health and well-being. 3 Stars Reliable and relatively consistent scientific data showing a substantial health benefit. 2 Stars Contradictory, insufficient, or preliminary studies suggesting a health benefit or minimal health benefit. 1 Star For an herb, supported by traditional use but minimal or no scientific evidence. For a supplement, little scientific support. |Supplement||Why| | | 3 Stars Lactase (Lactose Intolerance) 6000-9000 IU tablets chewed with a lactose-containing meal or 1000 IU in liquid form added to 8 ounces of milk before drinking. | | If you think you may suffer from lactose intolerance, supplementing with digestive enzyme-containing lactase when drinking or eating milk products may help. If | | 3 Stars Multivitamin Take as directed on label | | Diarrhea-related malabsorption can lead to deficiencies of many vitamins and minerals. For this reason, it makes sense to take a multivitamin-mineral supplement. The malabsorption problems that develop during diarrhea can lead to deficiencies of many vitamins and minerals. For this reason, it makes sense for people with diarrhea to take a | | 2 Stars Bovine Colostrum 10 to 20 grams daily | | Colostrum appears to be useful in treating certain types of infectious diarrhea. In one study, it significantly reduced diarrhea and the amount of oral rehydration required. In addition to a positive effect against acute rotavirus diarrhea, there is also evidence that specific forms of colostrum (derived from specially immunized cows or those with confirmed presence of specific antibodies) are effective against diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium parvum, Helicobacter pylori, Escherichia coli, and is not known whether commercially-available colostrum provides significant amounts of the specific immunoglobulins that are active against these organisms. Furthermore, unless the immunoglobulins are present in high enough concentrations, the preparation is not likely to be effective. | | 2 Stars Carob 15 grams daily | | Useful for treating diarrhea in adults, children, and infants, carob is rich in tannins that have an astringent or binding effect on the mucous membranes of the intestinal tract. | | 2 Stars Fiber Adults: 20 grams daily soluable fiber; for young children: 6.5 grams daily soy fiber | | While fiber from dietary or herbal sources is often useful for constipation, it may also play a role in alleviating diarrhea. While | | 2 Stars Glucosamine 250 mg with morning and evening meals | | Some autistic children suffer from chronic diarrhea. In one study, supplementing with glucosamine eliminated the diarrhea in five of six children with autism, possibly by blocking the effect of certain dietary components on the intestinal tract. Some autistic children suffer from chronic diarrhea. In a study of children with autistic spectrum disorders and persistent diarrhea for many years, supplementing with 500 mg of | | 2 Stars Glutamine 136 mg per pound of body weight | | Glutamine appears to be beneficial for diarrhea by improving the health of the intestinal lining, rather than by affecting the immune system. In a double-blind study of children (ages six months to two years) with acute diarrhea, supplementing with | | 2 Stars Psyllium 9 to 30 grams daily | | Psyllium seed (an excellent source of fiber) makes stool more solid and can help resolve diarrhea symptoms. While | | 2 Stars Sangre de Drago Consult a qualified healthcare practitioner | | An extract from stem bark latex of Sangre de drago, has been shown to be effective in treating traveler's diarrhea, non-specific diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with HIV and AIDS.

Double-blind research has demonstrated the extract's effectiveness for traveler's diarrhea, non-specific diarrhea, and diarrhea associated with | | 2 Stars Sangre de Drago (HIV and AIDS Support) Take under medical supervision: 350 to 700 mg four times per day for seven or more days | | An extract from stem bark latex of Sangre de Drago, an herb from the Amazon basin of Peru, has been shown to be effective against diarrhea associated with HIV and AIDS. An extract from stem bark latex of Sangre de Drago (Croton lechleri), an herb from the Amazon basin of Peru, has demonstrated significant anti-diarrheal activity in preliminary and double-blind trials. Additional double-blind research has demonstrated the extract's effectiveness for diarrhea associated with HIV infection and AIDS. Very high amounts of this extract (350-700 mg four times daily for seven or more days) were used in the studies. Such levels of supplementation should always be supervised by a doctor. Most of this research on Sangre de Drago is unpublished, and much of it is derived from manufacturers of the formula. Further double-blind trials, published in peer-reviewed medical journals, are needed to confirm the efficacy reported in these studies. | | 2 Stars Tormentil Root Extract (Rotavirus Infection) Take a liquid herbal extract daily: for the amount, multiply your age by three and take that number of drops | | Tormentil root is an herb that has been used for many years in different European folk medicines for treating diarrhea. Tormentil root (Potentilla tormentilla) is an herb that has been used for many years in different European folk medicines for the treatment of diarrhea. In a double-blind study of children with diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection, the duration of diarrhea averaged three days in children who received tormentil root extract, compared with five days in those who received a placebo. No adverse effects were seen. The amount of tormentil root extract used was 3 drops for every year of life, taken three times a day until diarrhea stopped, or for a maximum of five days. | | 1 Star Barberry Refer to label instructions | | Berberine, a constituent of barbarry, has been shown to improve infectious diarrhea in some double-blind trials.
