When queried when he will be taking his dose of the vaccine, Ramdev said, \"I will take it soon.\" He reiterated that his fight was not against any organisation. \"There is no doubt that good allopathic doctors are like angels sent by God. They are indeed a blessing for earth. However, there are also doctors who are unscrupulous but for that, [allopathy](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/allopathy) cannot be held responsible.\" He added that his fight was against unscrupulous elements including those in the pharma industry. \"Pradhan Mantri Jan Aushadi Kendras had to be started in order to dispense generic medicines since branded medicines were being sold at exorbitant rates. We want that people are saved from unnecessary medication and surgeries.\" He further said that \"there is no doubt that allopathy is the best treatment in emergency care and surgery cases but other diseases like lifestyle and genetic diseases can be and are being cured by us through yoga and Ayurveda following the protocols laid down by our ancestors.\" \"This is the main point that I wanted to make. There is no controversy as such,\" he added. "}
