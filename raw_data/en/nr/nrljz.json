Thoughts of death typically create a sense of worry and dread, but for those who have thanatophobia, the anxiety is extreme and panic-inducing. Though the condition may result in distress, the fear of death, like any phobia, is treated effectively with a combination of therapy, medication, and healthy lifestyle changes. What Is Thanatophobia? Thanatophobia is a specific phobia regarding the fear of death. [Specific phobias](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/specific-phobias/) are one group of mental health conditions that fall into the [anxiety disorder](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/anxiety/) category. All phobias are marked by an extremely powerful anxious or fearful response to a particular situation or object, in this case death and dying.1 For someone with thanatophobia, the fear of death can be very specific to their own death, or they may be afraid of the process of dying, the death of a loved one, or witnessing a loved one dying. Thanatophobia is not a mental health diagnosis on its own. Rather, someone who has a fear of death or a fear of dying would receive a diagnosis of specific phobia from a mental health professional with the understanding that thanatophobia was the issue of concern. Thanatophobia Vs. Necrophobia Thanatophobia and necrophobia overlap greatly as they both involve the fear of death, but there are subtle differences. Thanatophobia relates to death and dying of self or a loved one. Necrophobia, on the other hand, encompasses many other aspects of death, including: - Seeing dead bodies - Cemeteries - Funeral homes - Grave stones How Common Is Thanatophobia? Around 10% of people in the U.S. may have a specific phobia each year, but currently, there is no way of telling how many people have thanatophobia. Experts may be more interested in studying the more common triggers of phobia like animals, natural environments, and other situational events. Is Death Anxiety Normal? Death is a topic that tends to stir up a strong emotional reaction in people, no matter their age or background, so in this way, the fear of death is normal. What is not normal, though, is a level of fear that produces high stress, significant anxiety, distress, and panic. Because there is a fine line between a healthy fear of something dangerous and a mental health disorder, experts are needed to appropriately assess and address the symptoms. Specific fears in children are also normal with as many as 90% of children having at least one. A child could worry about death and dying, but unless it begins to drastically impair their life or functioning, it is an acceptable childhood behavior.2 Symptoms of Thanatophobia The symptoms of specific phobias like thanatophobia include extreme fear and active avoidance. Some of the most common symptoms of thanatophobia include:1 - Notable fear or anxiety about a certain situation, object, or item related to death and dying. For some, it could be going to hospitals, hearing about another's illness, or reading the obituary section in the newspaper. - Thoughts of death create this powerful reaction immediately and consistently - The person goes to great lengths to avoid death, thoughts of death, knowledge of other people dying, and seeing death on TV - The fear of death is not proportional to the actual situation with the person having strong reactions to minor stressors With all specific phobias, these symptoms must continue for at least months to meet criteria for the condition. Additionally, the symptoms related to thanatophobia cannot be more strongly linked to other conditions like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or separation anxiety.1 Co-Occurring Mental Health Conditions Something that may cloud the symptoms of thanatophobia is that most people with specific phobias will also present with other mental health symptoms and conditions. In clinical practice, people rarely seek treatment only for fear of death and dying.1 Some of the mental health disorder that regularly emerge alongside phobias include:1 [Depressive especially [dependent personality disorder](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/dependent-personality-disorder/) Each of these disorders has the power to shift and distort the symptoms of thanatophobia. They also complicate proper diagnosis and treatment. Outward Signs of Thanatophobia A person with thanatophobia could spend each day thinking about death, whether their own or the death of a loved one. Because they are so focused on the issue, they could appear unable to do anything else. Since people with phobias generally work hard to avoid their fears, a person with thanatophobia could avoid going anywhere, doing anything, or being around anyone if there is a chance of danger or injury.1 They may choose to stay in their home or a few areas they deem as \"safe.\" Thanatophobia can appear to share symptoms with other conditions like illness anxiety disorder or somatic symptom disorder because it creates excessive anxiety related to physical health conditions, but thanatophobia is grounded in the irrational fears of dying specifically. Thanatophobia in Children Children with thanatophobia and other specific phobias may appear to be more defiant and disobedient. As they try to avoid triggers that may refuse to follow through with directives from parents and teachers. They may tantrum often or cling closely to their parents for reassurance.1 What Causes Thanatophobia? Even though a phobia of death is an individualized issue composed of unique thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, the condition is a specific phobia with the same causes and triggers of other phobias. Like other phobias, the causes and triggers of thanatophobia are a combination of biological and environmental factors with a focus on previous experiences with death. Some of the risk factors that expose people to a higher risk of thanatophobia include:1,2,3 - Age: Specific phobias commonly emerge before age 10, but they may present at any age - Personality and temperamental factors like being inhibited behaviorally and being prone towards anxiety - Genetic and physical issues like having a family member with anxiety disorder or a similar type of phobia - Environmental risk factors involving the person's experiences and their reactions to these experiences, like the death of a parent or having overprotective parents - Having a scary or very negative experience with an illness or death - Seeing loved ones react in extreme or excessively fearful ways involving loss - Reading about the intense fear of death and dying other people have Of course, avoiding triggers will decrease the risk of thanatophobia presenting, but the role of protective factors is invaluable. When a person is surrounded by strong supports, a safe environment, and uses healthy coping skills, phobias are less likely to occur. Does Religion Impact the Fear of Death? Experts have studied the connection between the fear of death and religion. Based on their findings, there is little evidence to believe these two variables are connected at all. There is no obvious link between religion and fear of death, which means all people are equally at risk, regardless of their religion.8 How Is Thanatophobia Diagnosed? As a specific phobia, thanatophobia will be diagnosed by a mental health professional who completes a thorough evaluation of the individual. If they meet enough of the diagnostic criteria for the condition, \"specific phobia - other\" will be the diagnosis.

Even better, this form of treatment may help to address symptoms of co-occurring conditions like depression and anxiety. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) [Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/) addresses a person's symptoms by looking at their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors surrounding death, dying, and the fear of death to understand the issue and treat the concern.4 When viewing a person through the lens of CBT, the therapist will inspect how a person's thoughts about death and previous death-related behaviors will create feelings of intense anxiety and panic. CBT can help people learn new ways to shift their thinking patterns and calm their bodies to prevent and reduce the phobic response. CBT therapists can also educate and support people throughout the entire recovery process. Exposure Therapy More specific styles of CBT, like [exposure therapy](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/exposure-therapy/) and [systematic desensitization](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/systematic-desensitization/), further aid the treatment process. These therapy techniques involve putting the client in increasingly close contact with the anxiety provoking situation. In this case, the therapist will use creativity to have the client confront their fear of death.5 Through pictures, videos, guided imagery, and in-person exposure, desensitization encourages the person to experience, not avoid, their fear while practicing relaxation techniques and positive self-talk. Exposure sessions can be very distressing, but the therapist will always supervise the experience to ensure safety and improvement. Treatment Outcome & Timeline Standard CBT can create wanted results in about 12 weeks, but exposure therapy can work more rapidly.6 Studies indicate exposure-oriented treatments can produce symptom relief and lasting change in as little as one 4-hour session. Similar studies show progress in four 1-hour sessions.4 Medication Although therapy and lifestyle changes can create powerful symptom relief for the condition, doctors, psychiatrists, and nurse practitioners may also recommend medications for thanatophobia. A range of antidepressant and antianxiety medications can reduce the panic and anxiety that comes with the phobia. All antidepressants have the potential for side effects, including having a black box warning, the most serious warning given by the FDA, for increased risk of suicide in certain people.4 Talk with your doctor or health care provider about antidepressants and the risks to see if they are a good fit for you. Dealing with a Thanatophobia-Induced Panic Attack With any phobia, [panic attacks](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/panic-attack/) are a real concern, which means people with thanatophobia need to acknowledge the risks and take steps towards prevention.

In many instances, professional interventions involving therapy or a combination of therapy and medication will quickly and effectively reduce symptoms and improve well-being. Avoid Avoidance When a person has any specific phobia, their brain will convince them to avoid their triggers at any cost.
