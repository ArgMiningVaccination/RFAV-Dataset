Page 12.Access and Success: $304 million drive launches More than $42 million has been raised thus far in an effort to bring in $304 million for student aid and programs. President France A. C\u00f3rdova announced the campaign, called Access and Success, on April 9 as a preview to her inauguration April 11. Student access and success is one of the major goals in the University's next strategic plan.The fund drive and internal reallocations will expand the University's student aid contribu - tion to at least $77 million annu - ally. Much of the money raised will be placed in endowments, and endowment earnings will be used to fund the efforts. \"We must ensure that good students have access to a Purdue education and the support to succeed,\" C\u00f3rdova said. \"The loan burden will be greatly reduced. Students from all financial back -grounds will benefit. \"We are very thankful to all of our donors and especially proud that one of the first donors to contribute to this effort is a lead - ing member of our own faculty. Cynthia Stauffacher is a remark - able representative of the Purdue family and has stepped forward to demonstrate her commitment.\" Stauffacher is professor of biological sciences, leads the Purdue Cancer Center's Chemical and Structural Biology Program and is head of the Markey Center for Structural Biology. Murray Blackwelder, senior vice president for advancement, said donors have provided strong support for access and financial aid programs in the past. \"The types of programs that reduce student debt and add to the talent on campus seem to inspire people,\" Blackwelder said.

C\u00f3rdova maps ambitious course President France A. C\u00f3rdova introduced a number of new initiatives, including ones to enhance student success and pro - vide better channels to encourage interdisciplinary research, during her inaugural address April 11 at Elliott Hall of Music. C\u00f3rdova said helping both undergraduate and graduate students succeed is a top priority, along with fostering an environ - ment in which Purdue discoveries can be put to use to help solve the world's challenges in a process she called \"discovery with delivery.\" \"As a research university, Pur - due's goal is to be at the forefront of discovering new knowledge,\" she said. \"As a land-grant univer - sity, Purdue's goal is to take the knowledge created by the faculty on campus to the larger world outside the university, where it can make a difference for society.\" C\u00f3rdova outlined several of her proposals and goals for Pur - due, which include: n Creating a \"super project\" that would partner Purdue's of -fice of research with its office of engagement and Purdue Research Park to galvanize economic devel - opments to create a more robust and collaborative infrastructure for innovation, engagement and learning. n Establishing an institute for public policy and global affairs that could help in the transfer of new knowledge in engineering, physical and life sciences to the public. This would be done by en - gaging social scientists, education and business faculty to assess the potential effect this knowledge would have on society. n Expanding the number of students who earn credentials in innovation and entrepreneurship. n Enhancing seed funding for so-called \"blue-sky research\" that brings together people from across the University into collab - orative research initiatives. n Boosting the infrastructure for interdisciplinary research, such as at Purdue's Discovery Park, to reduce barriers that prevent faculty from working together. n Strengthening pathways from discovery to development and delivery by pumping new discoveries into Purdue's existing The inaugura Tion of Purdue 's eleven Th Presiden T This emblem, designed to resemble a NASA mission patch, appeared on screen during much of President France A.

The fiscal year 2009 general fund budget is anticipated to be $1.03 billion systemwide. The general fund budget relies primarily on state appropriations and student fees. This year state funding went up 4.7 percent sys - temwide and 4.8 percent for the West Lafayette campus. In approving Purdue's general fund budget, which supports edu - cational and base operating expenditures, the trustees endorsed the following spending plans for fiscal year 2009: n At the West Lafayette campus: A 5.1 percent spending increase to $835.9 million. n At Purdue Calumet: A 5.8 percent increase to $75.8 million. n At Indiana University-Pur - due University Fort Wayne: A 6.5 percent spending increase to $95.5 million. n At Purdue North Central: A 6.1 percent spending increase to $27.1 million. The final operating budget, reflecting estimates for all funds along with the details of strategic allocations, will be presented at the trustees' Sept. 18-19 meetings. The board set the 4.5 percent increase in student tuition and fees a year ago. In-state students new to the West Lafayette cam - pus this fall will pay $7,750 for academic 2008-09, an increase of $334. Out-of-state students will pay $23,224 at West Lafayette. Resident students first enrolled at the West Lafayette campus before summer 2006 will merit pay increases can reach up to 3.5% other board actions, page 2; Promotions of faculty, page 5 See Budget, page 3See Address, page 5aid, support for students spur new gifts, programsgift, program capsules, page 12Inside Purdue is published 18 times a year by the Office of University Periodicals for the faculty, administrative/professional and clerical/service staffs of Purdue University.

Vol. 17, No. 15 April 18, 2008 2 Board approves new degrees, endorses Woodson as provost The Board of Trustees ratified a new master's degree program in forensic science at Indiana University-Purdue University In - dianapolis and a bachelor's degree program in secondary education at Purdue North Central. At the April 11 meeting, the trustees also approved the ap - pointment of William \"Randy\" Woodson as the provost at the West Lafayette campus and the name changes of several depart - ments at Purdue University Calumet and Indiana University- Purdue University Fort Wayne. The master's of forensic sciences degree program at IUPUI is designed to build upon the bachelor's degree program already on campus and expand ties between the University and law enforcement and homeland security agencies. \"The Indiana State Police has a new crime laboratory with a high need for forensic scientists, and a recent report stated that there are more than 1,900 foren - sic scientists needed nationwide to reduce backlogs to a reasonable level,\" said Victor Lechtenberg, in - terim provost. \"The new IUPUI program will go a long way to respond to those needs.\" Lechtenberg said the program proposal has been met with sup - port from the Marion County/ Indianapolis Forensic Science Laboratory and the Indiana State Police Forensic Science Labora - tory, which have had to go outside the state to hire scientists to work in the laboratories. The degree, which is a 35-hour program, initially will have two concentrations, biol - ogy and chemistry. All students will take a core of courses in the forensic science system, practice, unique profession, ethics and law. The program will be distinc -tive because the law courses will be tailored for forensic science students, and it will offer courses in alcohol abuse public policy and forensic epidemiology, Lechten - berg said. Enrollment in the program is expected to reach 20 students in the first year and 22 in subse - quent years. The new bachelor's degree program in secondary educa - tion at Purdue North Central is designed to meet the needs of area employers and the secondary education communities of La - Porte, Porter and Starke counties, which have had to hire unquali - fied teachers, Lechtenberg said. \"The shortage of qualified teachers in secondary math and science is well-documented, and this program will help remedy that by offering licensure for grades 7-12 in five different con - tent areas: life sciences, chemistry, mathematics, physical science and physics,\" he said. \"It will be the first program in the surrounding areas to offer a similar option.\" Enrollment is projected to be 20 students the first year and increase to 58 by the fifth year. Woodson's appointment as the new provost also was ratified. He currently serves as the Glenn W. Sample Dean of Agriculture. He will become provost May 1. As provost, Woodson will be responsible for oversight of all Purdue colleges and schools and related activities in coordination with the Office of the President. His office will oversee academic systems such as the libraries, computing center and student services (admissions, registrar, financial aid and health facilities), plus all Purdue cultural centers. Trustees also approved changing the name of three departments at Purdue Calumet. Construction Management & Engineering T echnologies will be known as Construction Science & Organizational Leadership. Elec - trical & Computer Engineering T echnology will become Engi - neering T echnology. Computer Information T echnology will become Computer Information T echnology & Graphics. For IPFW, trustees approved the department name change of Electrical and Computer Engi - neering T echnology to Computer and Electrical Engineering T ech - nology & Information Systems and T echnology. The new name reflects a restructuring of Infor - mation Systems and Information T echnology, which will better serve students and prospective employers and present faculty members with more opportuni - ties to explore cross-disciplinary research initiatives, Lechtenberg said. 10-year capital plan OK'd by trustees with array of big projects The Board of Trustees on April 11 approved the University's $1.04 billion 10-year capital improve - ment plan, which includes improvements to the Recreational Sports Center and renovation of life sciences facilities on the West Lafayette campus. The trustees also approved construction of the Mackey Arena complex renovation and addition, and a new Wade Utility Plant boiler. They awarded construc - tion contracts to build Discovery Learning Center and renovate Duhme Hall, phase two in the ongoing Windsor Halls renova - tion project. In addition, the trustees approved planning for addi - tional student housing at the Fort Wayne campus and increased funding for renovations to McCutcheon Hall on the West Lafayette campus. The 10-year capital plan includes all new projects planned beginning in July 2009. The plan is broken into five biennial periods. The 2009-2011 biennium includes plans for $98 million in improvements to the Recreational Sports Center, $80 million for construction and renovation of life sciences facilities, and an $11 million, first-phase replacement for mechanical engineering's Ray W. Herrick Laboratories. Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne plans include a $38 million expansion to the student housing complex, a new $16.8 million parking garage and $6 million in renovations to the Helmke Library and the Classroom Medical Building. Purdue North Central plans a $33.7 million Student Services and Activities Complex. \"The requests in this plan were developed through a process that involved the evaluation of programmatic needs and priori - ties,\" said Joseph Mikesell, interim vice president for physical facili - ties. \"If and when these projects begin and how long they take to construct are subject to several factors including available funding.\" The capital plan will be sub - mitted to the Indiana Commis - sion for Higher Education later this month and become part of the 2009-2011 biennium capital improvement budget request. The trustees also approved renovations and additions to Mackey Arena with a total bud - get of $99.5 million. Athletics Director Morgan Burke said the 278,000-square-foot complex will eliminate the need to construct three new buildings that would have cost almost $300 million. \"This project will bring Mack - ey Arena into the 21st century in terms of program space, fan amenities and accessibility,\" Burke said. \"The addition to this 1967 landmark will remedy deficiencies in sports medicine, rehabilitation, and strength and conditioning facilities, as well as locker rooms.\" The Intercollegiate Athlet - ics Department, which is self- supporting and receives no tax dollars, will pay for the project completely with gifts, increased concession and premium seating revenue, and income generated from the Big T en Network and other conference television mon - ies. The complex will include ad - ditional meeting, office and study space, and also relocate football practice fields and parking areas. The trustees also approved the use of the design/build process to purchase and install a new boiler in an addition being built at the Wade Utility Plant. The authori - zation will allow Purdue to hire a single firm both to design and build the $53 million project, thus speeding the process and con - taining expenses, said Erick Van Meter, interim senior director of utilities and construction. Funding will come from bonds approved in 2007. The contract should be awarded by January, and the three-year construction period is to begin in March 2009. \"Boiler Number 6 will help us meet the growing need on campus for heating, cooling and electricity while also reducing Purdue's impact on the envi - ronment,\" Van Meter said. \"By burning limestone with the coal, chemical reactions occur that capture airborne pollutants ef - ficiently and effectively.\" The process, called circulating fluidized bed technology, also is used in Boiler 5. The plant, where 99 percent of the fuel burned is Indiana coal, with the CFB tech - nology can use the less expensive types of coal. Boilers 5 and 6 will be able to burn environmentally friendly biomass fuels when they become more readily available. The trustees also approved awarding an $18.6 million con - struction contract for Discovery Learning Center to Kettlehut Construction Inc. of Lafayette. The center, within Discovery Park, will house learning research laboratories to examine how people learn and solve problems as well as develop lifelong learn - ing abilities needed in the work force of the future. The center also will house the Mann Institute for Biomedical Development, which is designed to help commercialize innovative biomedical technologies. Two floors of the center will be de - voted to office space serving other Discovery Park centers. Discovery Learning Center construction is scheduled to be - gin this month. The $25 million project is being funded largely through $11 million in gifts and $10 million from the capital reserve for buildings. The trustees also awarded an $8.4 million contract to the J.R. Kelly Co. of Lafayette for phase two renovations to the Wind - sor Residence Halls residential complex. All 77 Duhme Hall rooms will be air-conditioned, and the hall will receive a new elevator and all new electrical and mechanical systems. Histori - cal architectural elements will be restored or replaced, and fire protection and accessibility will be improved. \"This project is part of a $200 million plan to increase the safety and comfort of our students cam - puswide,\" said Barbara Frazee, executive director of University Residences. \"It also is preserving a distinctive part of Purdue's his - tory, where future women leaders have been educated since Amelia Earhart lived here as a career adviser in the 1930s.\" Construction is scheduled to begin in May and be complete by June 2009. The $11.3 million project is funded by bonds that will repaid from resident user fees within the self-supporting University Residences system. The trustees granted Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne's request to plan a $38 million expansion to the student housing complex that will add up to 450 new beds. Design Collaborative of Fort Wayne was selected to design the project, which may include additional commons facilities, a service and maintenance building, and open recreation space. The trustees voted to allow planning for storm sewer modi - fications for the West Lafayette campus. Meliora Environmental Design LLC of Kimberton, Pa., was selected to design the $5.6 million project, which will bring the storm sewer system in com - pliance with U.S. requirements. On April 10, the trustees' Physical Facilities Committee approved increasing the authori - zation from $8.9 million to $11.2 million to install air conditioning and fire protection in McCutch - eon Hall. The project is being funded by University Residences' repair and rehabilitation budget.

The breed is being noticed more and more for its courage, intelligence, obedi - ence, affection and reliability, Standifer says. The acquisition, funded through drug-case fines and confiscations by the Tippecanoe County Prosecutor's Office, is working well already, says Capt. John Cox of the Purdue department's Special Services Division. \"We're excited to have the dog,\" Cox says. \"It's a new tool for us. It's also a good PR tool. The dog seems to be a big hit with the students. This dog is very friendly and pretty quiet. \"The dog was picked out based on characteristics that would do well in a uni - versity environment.\" Nicky has participated in both enforce - ment and education events, Cox says. Though Purdue's first K-9, Nicky has colleagues in the other law enforcement agencies in the county. The pairs of dogs and human handlers gather regularly to train, Cox says. Nicky weighs about 75 pounds and will fill out some more. He was born in Holland and received early training as a sporting dog, including bite training. After he came to the renowned Vohne Liche Kennels in Denver, Ind., Standifer joined him for a 200-hour training program. \"During the five-week training, I worked with him on tracking, apprehen - sion, and detection of narcotics in vehicles, buildings, and open area,\" Standifer says. \"We also trained on building searches, open area searches, and industrial searches for apprehension. Nicky is trained for the detection of meth, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana.\" Standifer and Nicky are also certified through the American Working Dog Association. They use a specially equipped squad car and work primarily on an evening shift, though on call for situations in which Nicky can be helpful. Nicky lives at Standifer's home.Dutch shepherd nicky has training on two continents Photo ProvIDeD by P UrDUe PolIce Officer Anthony Standifer with new K-9 Nicky, a Dutch shepherd, at a brief ceremony marking Nicky's start with Purdue police on March 10.

RIGHT: Ximena Arriaga, associate professor of psychological sciences, teaches a research-focused seminar for honors students in the Department of Psychological Sciences.Six exceptional teachers were honored with 2008 Outstanding Undergraduate T eaching Awards in Memory of Charles B. Murphy on Sunday at the Honors Convocation in Elliott Hall of Music. The Murphy is given annually in recog - nition of outstanding teaching in all phases of undergraduate instruction at the West Lafayette campus. The University's highest undergraduate teaching honor, the Murphy is accompanied by a $10,000 cash award and induction into Purdue's T eaching Academy, which provides leadership for the improvement of undergraduate, graduate and outreach teaching. The 2008 winners: n Ximena Arriaga, associate professor of psychological sciences . At Purdue since 1999, Arriaga has been chosen to receive a Murphy award because of her passion for teaching, strong teaching evaluations and devotion to developing the next generation of research psychologists. Arriaga played a pivotal role in launch - ing the Research-Focused Honors Program in the Department of Psychological Sci - ences. In the program, students enroll in a two-semester seminar course and must complete an independent research project over the span of three semesters. Students say the experience had a profound effect in preparing them for a research career: \"This class has been absolutely priceless. I feel it has better prepared me for graduate school and given me a greater appreciation about psychology and research.\" ... \"[This] has been by far the best experience in psy - chology and grad school preparation that I could've asked for. Dr. Arriaga motivates and pushes students to achieve their abso - lute best work.\" ... \"It was very challenging, but my instructor provided the proper guid - ance and aid to help me achieve my goals.\" Howard Weiss, head of the department, says: \"In addition to top-level classroom teaching, Professor Arriaga has done much to reshape and modernize our undergradu - ate curriculum to better meet the needs of students and the standards of faculty.\" Arriaga wants students to be able to track their success back to their experience at Purdue.\"Y ears after leaving Purdue, I want my students to be able to say they are doing something challenging or rewarding better as a result of something they learned in my course,\" she says. \"It might be something mi - nor, such as knowing that data, criteria, and phenomena are plural nouns and go with plural verbs, but hopefully it is something major, such as giving a technical talk that is well received or having a paper accepted for publication in a prestigious journal.\" n Robert \"Pete\" Bill, professor of veter - inary pharmacology . Bill adds the Murphy to the 24 teaching awards and recognitions he has received since starting at Purdue in 1985. Previous honors include a fellowship in Purdue's T eaching Academy, the Carl J. Norden Distinguished T eacher Award from the School of V eterinary Medicine, and the Raymond E. Plue Outstanding T eacher Award from the school's graduates. Students have praised Bill for his clear and engaging teaching style: \"Dr. Bill genuinely cares what we learn and is very knowledgeable about the subjects he teaches.\" ... \"His hopes and dreams for excellence will follow us into the veterinary world and throughout our lives.\" ... \"Dr. Bill makes it very easy to understand the material he is presenting and interesting as well.\" In addition, Bill is credited with the creation of the V eterinary T echnology Distance Learning program, an associate of science degree program launched in 1999. It is Purdue's first undergraduate degree program to be delivered completely by distance learning. Bill says his goal is to excite students about learning and help them to develop content knowledge and thinking skills. \"I enjoy taking complex concepts and putting them into everyday language that students can understand,\" he says. An early curiosity about effective learn - ing methods helped draw Bill into the field. As an average, somewhat unengaged junior high school student, Bill realized that he could be as successful as the \"smart kids\" with the appropriate approach. Now, Bill uses his interest in education, problem-based learning, motivation in the classroom, and distance learning to support his students' success. \"It is extremely gratifying for the stu - dent to finally grasp a difficult concept or to discover that missing piece that makes everything fall into place,\" he says. \"They just light up! T o be a small part of that discovery or that intellectual gratification is its own reward.\"Photos by Mark Simons Becky Brown, associate professor of linguistics, talks with one of her former students, senior Antonia Wang, about graduate school options.April 18, 2008 7 core courses. Four years after its introduction, se - nior students now ask for the chance to be mentors while freshmen better un - derstand the curriculum's progression. One former student says: \"I found shadowing another student nurse and attending a junior year lecture very benefi - cial as it helped me see where you are going and what you are going to all your classes for.\" Coyle-Rogers also engages students outside the classroom, serving as volunteer mentor for Horizons Program since 2001. Through the pro - gram, she meets with one or two at-risk freshmen each fall to focus on goal setting, time manage - ment and study skills. Coyle-Rogers says she tries to incorporate expe - riences from her 35-year nursing career into her courses as well as create a comfortable environment that encourages open discussion. \"Y ou have to give of yourself and be a person,\" she says. \"Y ou can't be a talk - ing head or an ivory tower sort of person. It's about being real to the students. Once you've created that environment, that's what makes for a good classroom and engaging lectures.\" n Linda Naimi, assistant professor in the Department of Organizational Leadership and Supervision . Naimi's effectiveness as a teacher and mentor is illustrated by the posi - tive comments and high ratings she receives from students on evaluations as well as by the lines that often form outside her office. Students rate her instruction of the \"Leading with Integrity\" course a 4.9 and 5 on a five-point scale. Students say about Naimi and the course: \"Dr. Naimi opened my eyes with her semester-long exercises, teaching me that choosing the right thing to do is often extremely hard.\" ... \"This class surprised me by helping me to build critical-thinking and decision-making skills I never knew I had.\" Naimi also received the College of T echnology's Outstanding Non-T enured Faculty Member Award for 2008. T o aid student learning and provide greater access to learning resources, Naimi created distance education versions of each ethics course and made course materials available online through WebCT, Moodle and Blackboard. Naimi also works with students on in - dependent research projects, helps students prepare papers for publication, sponsors students at conferences and assists under - graduates in starting up new businesses.n Becky Brown, associate professor of linguistics . Twenty years' worth of out - standing teaching evaluations, energetic mentoring, and dedication to excellence in teaching have contributed to Brown's selec - tion for the Murphy Award. Since joining the faculty in 1988, Brown has taught 15 different undergraduate courses \u2014 each with an honors compo - nent \u2014 in the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures and the Interde - partmental Program in Linguistics. She has developed several courses across the French and linguistics curriculum, including a cul - ture-based course on French gastronomy that includes lab demonstrations, guest speakers and a field experience at a cooking school in France. Paul Dixon, head of the department, says of Brown and her most recent endeavor: \"The logistics of this course alone would be enough to scare off most faculty members, but I have seen her embark on this and other projects with unstoppable zeal and persistence.\" Students also appreciate Brown's dedication: \"It's so nice to have a professor who cares so much about their class and their students.\" ... \"Professor Brown did a fantastic job of teaching. I have learned so much from this class and would take it again in a heartbeat.\" Brown relies on sincerity and humor to make a connection with her students and to create an atmosphere conducive to learning. \"The class can be formal or informal, but if there's laughter then students are plugged in and a connection is made,\" she says. \"Above all, the students want to know that you care about their learning experience.\" Brown credits her colleagues for pro - viding her with the inspiration and encour - agement to strive for excellence. \"I think that one can have a wildly cre - ative idea, a unique and innovative teaching proposal, or a killer lesson plan, but these initiatives won't come to fruition without the fertile environment that Purdue has af - forded me throughout my career,\" she says. n Patricia Coyle-Rogers, associate professor of nursing . At Purdue since 2000, Coyle-Rogers has been recognized by School of Nursing faculty and students for her inspiring teaching. Students testify to Coyle-Rogers' enthu - siasm and professionalism: \"I wanted to let you know how much I appreciate your class. Y ou are so passionate about nursing, and it really shows in your teaching.\" ... \"I have been at Purdue for three years. I have changed majors, but I have never had a professor motivate me to see why I want to be a nurse as well as make me excited to be a nurse.\" Coyle-Rogers' teaching strategies have helped her earn ratings of high 4s and 5s from students. In \"Dynamics of Nursing,\" Coyle-Rogers introduced the practice of having freshman students observe an upper-level nursing class and shadow a student nurse at a clinical site in order to show the application of required important role of any teacher.\" As coordinator of the Honors Program within the Department of Agricultural Economics, Wilson created a course to help students launch their honors research proj - ects. Enrollment in the honors program has increased from two students per year to 19 under her leadership. Wilson says she enjoys interacting with students in and outside of the classroom as well as affecting their lives. \"As teachers we have the opportunity to impact students, make a difference, and change lives,\" she says. \"Two of life's greatest rewards are helping others and learning something new, and as professors we have the opportunity to do both. When I am able to hold the attention of a class, see them actively listening and get them actively engaged in discussion, it energizes me and it is rewarding. \"When students come by my office just to say hi or thank you, come back to visit or send e-mail after they have graduated, I know I have done something that mattered to them.\"Naimi, also an attorney at law, wants stu - dents not only to understand the coursework but to understand themselves as well. \"They cannot lead others if they don't understand their own strengths and weak - nesses,\" says Naimi, who came to Purdue in 2004. \"What motivates them to do their best \u2014 or their worst? When presented with a problem or an ethical dilemma, how do they decide what is the right and best thing to do? And when their lives have run their course, what do they want people to say about them? I want them to be able to look back on their lives and say proudly, 'I made a positive difference in this world.' \" n Christine Wilson, associate profes - sor of agricultural economics. Wilson's excellence in teaching has been recognized by faculty and students since her arrival at Purdue in 2001. Previous awards and recognitions include a fellowship in the T eaching Academy, the Richard L. Kohls Outstanding Undergraduate T eaching Award from the College of Agriculture and three Outstanding T eacher Awards from the Department of Agricultural Economics. Student evaluations point out that Wilson uses creative teaching techniques, combines various methods to facilitate student learning, and is deeply devoted to student learning. Students say of Wilson: \"Dr. Wilson is a professor that is easy to talk with, always willing to be there for you, and makes you comfortable when talking to her.\" ... \"She has helped inspire me to be a better student and take a more in-depth look into the marketing field; this I feel is the most Linda Naimi, assistant professor in the Department of Organizational Leadership and Supervision, con - ducts a class on business ethics and leadership in the Krannert Building. Christine Wilson, associate professor of agricultural economics, shares a lesson with her students in Rawls Hall. Wilson joined the Purdue faculty in 2001. Other awards The McCoy Awards, awards by colleges and schools for outstanding teaching, and several awards for particular forms of service also were presented Sunday at Honors Convocation.

April 18, 2008 8 Photo by mark s Imons Mike Olson (front), manager of the Purdue Shop in Purdue Memorial Union, stands on the sales floor as employee Doug Louks staffs the counter. The store, special - izing in Purdue fan items, is considered an apparel shop in retail terms. It opened March 31. Purdue Shop fills niche for University apparel at Union Purdue spirit and loyalty are the forces driving the Purdue Shop, the latest retail addition at Purdue Memorial Union. The shop is at the east end of Union Commons, just down a flight of stairs from the Grant Street entrance and across from Pappy's. Its opening March 31 fills a niche identified by students and staff members in the Union's re - tail strategic workgroup, says Bob Mindrum, PMU director. \"This group has recommend - ed having banking services, a travel agency and now an apparel shop,\" he says. \"They have a track record of being fairly successful.\" It's true that apparel \u2014 shirts, caps, socks, gym shorts \u2014 consti - tutes the central part of the inven - tory. But while concentrating on Purdue, the store has many other items and will broaden its prod - uct range steadily and welcomes requests, says store manager Mike Olson. \"We're a specialty retailer that's here for the fan,\" he says. Since the opening, the Purdue Shop already has added Fossil watches with a Purdue design as well as the board game Purdueo - poly. Further, the shop's owner, Sports Avenue Inc., is preparing a Web site at www.thepurdueshop. com . Mindrum says an apparel shop is fairly standard in union buildings across the country, and it's sensible in terms of Union goals. \"We look for opportunities that meet three basic criteria: 1) is consistent with our mission to provide services; 2) generates foot traffic; and 3) generates income at a positive level.\" Like the Card Services Office, which also leases Union space, the Purdue Shop is expected to at - tract incoming students and their families who then will become familiar with the Union. \"We partner with Admissions on numerous events \u2014 Intro - ducing Purdue, Day on Campus, Purdue's for Me, etc.,\" Mindrum says. \"A lot of times these are par - ents with their incoming students, and the Union is the first place they come. \"I went through this as a par - ent, sort of 'Y eah, I want a Purdue Dad cap, and I want my daughter to start wearing a Purdue shirt.' It's all about affiliation with and loyalty to the institution.\" The selection of Sports Avenue followed a request for proposals sent to many compa - nies including the familiar shops in the area, Mindrum says. The company and the Union worked out the store name together. \"I do like that we ended up with Sports Avenue in this ven - ture, as they just have a slightly different product line,\" he says. \"Nothing wrong with the product lines in the other stores, but if it's something that's unique to the Purdue Memorial Union, we think it's beneficial to us.\" The tenant-lease arrange - ment, adapted to include Web sales, follows the Union's pattern of not directly managing busi - nesses outside its \"core competen - cies,\" he says. PEFCU, the various ATMs, and STA Travel are in that group. \"We manage the major - ity of our business operations \u2014 like our hotel, catering, retail restaurants, and our recreation center,\" he says, although some of the branded restaurants operate under royalty licensing arrange - ments. Another plus with the Purdue Shop, he says, is the owner's ea - gerness to be open a lot of hours. The hours are 10 a.m.-9 p.m. Monday-Saturday, noon-6 p.m. Sunday.Kuhn, McLuckey share McCoy Award Two faculty members are sharing the 2008 McCoy Award for out - standing research in the sciences. Richard Kuhn, professor of biological sciences, and Scott McLuckey, professor of chemistry, are the co-recipients. The Herbert Newby McCoy Award is given to the Purdue student or faculty member \"in the science departments of Purdue making the greatest contribution of the year to science.\" The award was established in 1964 through a bequest from Dr. Ethel T erry McCoy in memory of her husband, who was an alum - nus in the College of Science. The award carries a cash prize of $4,000 and a gift of $7,000 to support the recipient's research. Each winner will receive those amounts. Also, each will present a Mc - Coy Distinguished Lecture next fall. Kuhn, who came to Purdue in 1991, is head of the Department of Biological Sciences and the Gerald and Edna Mann Director of Bindley Bioscience Center. He is a leading figure in Purdue's world-renowned Mar - key Center for Structural Biology, which has ascertained numerous matters of the form and function of viruses. Among other honors, he became a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007. His nominators cite \"Kuhn's expertise in X-ray crystallo - graphic and electron microscope studies of viruses and macromo - lecular structures.\" They describe its importance to the virus structure studies of Michael Rossmann, the Hanley Distinguished Professor of Bio - logical Sciences, and commend their \"collaborative mode of experimental research\" in a field requiring many methodologies. Kuhn has been central, the nominators write, in \"discovery and description of first flavi-virus, dengue virus, which is responsible for dengue hemorrhagic fever and 17,000 deaths worldwide in 2005.\" Other advances includes further knowledge of the dengue virus, description of the structure of West Nile virus and \"construc - tion of replicons of genes of yel - low fever virus, alpha viruses and sindbis virus.\" Kuhn has provided significant amounts of review leadership for publications and for grants by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. McLuckey joined Purdue in 2000 with a budding research initiative that has bloomed in a big way, his nominator says. In 2007, he won the Award in Chemical Instrumentation from the American Chemical Society's Division of Analytical Chemistry. He has created a powerful and useful method that enhances the role of mass spectrometry in proteomics. \"He and his group have per - formed groundbreaking research into the fundamental ion chem - istry and physics of the reactions of high mass, multiply charged bio-ions with ions of opposite polarity and have demonstrated a wide range of useful applica - tions for this novel chemistry,\" the nominator writes. T o do this, McLuckey built on 1980s advances such as electro - spray ionization and electrody - namic ion trap, which helped establish the field of gas-phase bio-ion/ion reactions. \"McLuckey recognized that these two developments made possible the study of the reactions of oppositely charged ions in the controlled environment of an ion trap,\" the nominator writes. The research is so sound and has progressed so far, the writer goes on, that three commercial vendors of mass spectrometers are offering ion/ion reaction methodology and others are de - veloping instruments with it. \"The field of gas-phase bio-ion/ion reactions has been largely defined by McLuckey and his students and post-docs,\" the writer says. Awards given to faculty, staff at Honors Convo Purdue faculty and staff received a number of awards Sunday (April 13) during the University's annual Honors Convocation in Elliott Hall of Music.

A Purdue alumnus has pledged $4 million to help build a new home for Purdue Musical Organizations. Ralph E. Bailey and his wife, Bettye J. Holder Bailey, of Naples, Fla., and Greenwich, Conn., are making the lead gift to construct a facility expected to cost as much as $8 million. The music groups currently are housed in a corner of Elliott Hall of Music. Ralph Bailey is a 1949 me - chanical engineering alumnus who has received several honors and an honorary doctorate from Purdue. Among his professional roles, he is the retired chairman and chief executive officer of Conoco. Bettye Bailey served as a trustee of Wilmington University (formerly Wilmington College) in Wilmington, Del., for 23 years. Plans for the facility include multiple rehearsal rooms, office space, a lounge, a music library and environmentally controlled storage space. A location for the new build - ing has not been confirmed. n Technology center. Purdue Research Park broke ground April 7 on a nearly 13-acre expansion for which the wife of a Purdue alumnus has donated $3 million toward a new technology center. The deferred gift from Heddy Kurz of Louisville will be applied toward construction of the park's $14.5 million Purdue T echnology Center II building. The center will support about 275 jobs and 26 companies. The average annual wage of employees working in the park is $52,000. Kurz's gift is in honor of her late husband, Herman, who received a degree in electrical engineering from Purdue. She has made previous gifts totaling more than $4 million. The Herman and Heddy Kurz Purdue T echnology Center is expected to open in 2009. The 105,000-square-foot building will house several startup and expand - ing companies and the nearly 100 Purdue Research Foundation employees, who will move out of the original Purdue T echnology Center to make room for new companies there. n College of Technology and Purdue Libraries. A Purdue alumnus and his wife have an - nounced an unrestricted gift of $2 million to these two units. The deferred gift from Richard and Kyle Thomas of Greenwood, Ind., was announced April 9 during Purdue T echnol - ogy Week. Richard Thomas received a bachelor's degree in industrial economics from Purdue in 1962 and is president of the Gilliam Group Inc. in Indianapolis. His wife, Kyle, is a certified public accountant who owns her own accounting firm in Greenwood. Ninety percent of the gift, or $1.8 million, is designated for the College of T echnology, and the re - maining 10 percent is designated for Purdue Libraries. Unrestricted funds allow the recipient to allocate money where the need is the greatest. Examples of priorities in the College of T echnology include student scholarships and fellowships, fac - ulty development programs, and global and study-abroad initia - tives.

CSSAC membership applications due May 16 for '08-09 openings cssac news: vice chair to be elected, trip to chicago cubs game planned Qualified Energy Savings again helping budget, environment Three buildings on the West Lafayette campus have been selected for Qualified Energy Sav - ings (QES) upgrades as the state program resumes. Improving campus energy efficiency is a key part of Purdue's stewardship initiatives, but how to pay for it has been an ongoing challenge. Purdue was the state's leading user of QES opportunities before budget shortfalls shelved the program early this decade. By QES legislation, Purdue can borrow up to $10 million to retrofit existing facilities. The projects are designed to pay for themselves in 10 years or less from the energy and operational savings. As the University realizes the financial savings from these upgrades, the loans are paid back, and more funds can be borrowed. The Board of Trustees has approved QES projects for Brown Laboratory of Chemistry, Stewart Center, and the Civil Engineering Building, to begin this summer. The budget for this QES proj - ect totals just over $4.5 million. Average annual energy savings of approximately $580,000 are anticipated, for a project payback of less than eight years. In addition, the energy sav - ings from these projects translates to a 3.3 percent annual reduction in overall carbon dioxide emis - sions from Wade Utility Plant. This reduction is equivalent to taking 3,583 cars off the road each year, if each were getting 25 mpg and traveling 10,000 miles per year. The QES projects at Brown, Stewart, and Civil will focus on replacing outdated air han - dling units and inefficient water fixtures, and upgrading indirect digital controls. Purdue's QES efforts will: n Help reduce the deferred maintenance backlog. n Serve as a vehicle to make capital replacements, such as replacing old air handlers with more efficient models. n Make these buildings more energy efficient, which in turn places less demand for energy from the power plant. n Help provide increased comfort to campus customers. Project manager Rustin Meis - ter comments, \"I am very excited about this project. This is really a great opportunity to provide energy-efficient systems that will provide positive outcomes for both the University and the build - ing occupants \u2014 a win-win for everyone.\" The contractor, Energy Systems Group, has planned a comprehensive package of energy conservation measures. Pro - posed ECMs at all three build -ings include water conservation, replacing 3.5 gallons per flush (gpf) toilets with more efficient 1.6 gpf toilets, replacing 1.7 gpf urinals with 0.61 gpf models, and retrofitting kitchen and lavatory faucets with aerators to reduce water consumption. Additional upgrades include: n At Brown, building-wide mechanical and controls up - grades, to optimize the amount of air required by the fume hoods in labs, while maintaining a safe operating environment for the occupants. n At Civil, repair and retro- commissioning of 11 air handling units to reduce air flow during off-peak periods to reduce energy use, as well as installation of new automated controls network. n At Stewart, installation of variable frequency drives on 15 large-volume air handling units to reduce airflow during off-peak loads, thus reducing fan energy and re-heat costs. Upgrade of controls system for greater ef - ficiency and improve building conditioning. n Also at Stewart, installation of carbon dioxide sensors and new fans to regulate outside air and control associated building exhausts to reduce outside air heating and cooling loads. Previous QES projects have been performed in Brown, Stew - art, and Lilly Hall of Life Sciences, on regional campuses at Fort Wayne and North Central, and throughout the West Lafayette academic campus to replace light - ing fixtures and sensors. Energy-efficiency efforts have continued in recent years by add - ing campus-wide metering and improvements at the power plant, among other things.April 18, 2008 11 Calendar item deadlines May 2, for the May 13 issue (events of June 1-30).

Ride is getting greener at Transportation Purdue's Transportation Ser - vice continues to realign its fleet toward environmentally friendly vehicles while pursuing other green practices. Bus trips just got greener with the arrival of a midsize coach, the Concorde II. This 30-passenger bus is available for one-day travel. It offers the comfortable seating and ride of a large coach, though it doesn't have a restroom. Moreover, every seat comes equipped with a DC electrical outlet, and all passengers may enjoy watching a DVD played on the five overhead LCD monitors. Purchased from Glaval Bus in Elkhart, Ind., the Concorde II was built on a Ford F-650 airporter- style chassis with a Cummins diesel engine and 2200 Allison transmission. The new coach is engineered for ultra-low sulfur fuel and may use B-20 fuel (20 percent biodiesel and 80 percent petroleum). Biodiesel is a clean-burning alternative fuel, produced from domestic, renewable resources, such as soybeans. Currently, TS uses B-5 in its coaches, buses, fire response vehicles, and large service trucks. Another recent acquisition is a Thomas Transit-style bus with a smooth-sided, more modern ap - pearance. This vehicle will serve as an alternative to school buses for classes or other groups plan - ning trips to closer destinations. Amenities include air condi - tioning, reclining seats, and an air-ride suspension. This bus and the Concorde II have allowed TS to sell two 1986 coach buses. New hybrid cars The hybrid fleet at TS has doubled with the addition of two new Chevy Malibu hybrids. The midsize sedans will comfortably seat four to five passengers. Powered by a 2.4-liter, four- cylinder engine with a 36-volt electric motor, the Malibu hybrid offers fuel economy rated for 24 city and 32 highway miles. The 2008 Chevrolet Malibu has received a five-star frontal and side impact crash test rat - ing from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. In addition, it was named the 2008 North America Car of the Y ear and was listed in Car and Driver as one of 2008's 10 best cars. The hybrids will be offered to the campus community for busi - ness trips and will be monitored for mileage, service costs, and customer satisfaction. \"Our customers have indi - cated that they love the hybrids we currently have, but would like more interior and trunk space. We hope the Malibu hybrid will meet these requests,\" says Carol Cox, director of TS. Fuel factors Nearly all vehicles in the Transportation Service fleet are flex-fuel and will operate using E- 85, a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent unleaded gasoline. At the present time, E-10, also known as gasohol, is the only gasoline-ethanol blend available at TS. However, TS is considering adding a separate 3,000- to 4,000- gallon E-85 tank and pump. Alan Leonard, director of ser - vice enterprises, and the TS staff are investigating grant support and other funding for this.Photo ProvIDeD by Phys Ical facIlItIes This 30-passenger midsize coach is now part of the Transportation Service fleet. It is called the Concorde II and was purchased from Glaval Bus in Elkhart, Ind. Its diesel engine can use ultra-low sulfur fuel including B-20 (20 percent biodiesel).What to do For your next Purdue trip, call 49-46550 for bus service or 49-42114 to reserve one of the new or current vehicles of - fered at Transportation Service. The office is open 7 a.m.- 6 p.m. Monday-Friday and 7-11 a.m. Saturday. environmental efforts, like motor vehicles, have many parts Maintenance and upkeep give Transportation Service plenty of environmental considerations beyond vehicles themselves. TS is an active member of Purdue's Sustainability Council, a group of nearly 100 students, faculty, and staff who meet regu - larly about sustainability topics in campus academic and operational activities. This and other partnering helps TS satisfy the monitoring it receives by law from the Environ - mental Protection Agency. TS efforts include: n Plastic, cardboard, and newspapers are separated and collected by crews from Purdue Recycling. n A 2,000-gallon under - ground tank holds used oil, which is routinely collected and recycled by Future Environmental, a Mid - west used oil collection company and provider of environmental services. n Future Environmental also collects TS anti-freeze in 55-gal - lon drums for recycling. n Scrap iron (broken parts, old rims, etc,) and vehicular ra - diators are placed into a recycling bin and are collected by Oscar Winski, a Lafayette scrap metal recycler.n Used oil filters are separated by metal and paper and are recy - cled by Heritage Environmental. n Gas fuel filters, along with absorbent pads, are shreddable products with high-energy content value. These products are picked up by Heritage Environ - mental Services in Indianapolis. n Batteries are returned to La - fayette Auto Supply for recycling. n Shop rags are given to Cintas Inc., a uniform supply company in Frankfort, Ind. Cintas launders and returns the rags for reuse. n Contaminated, old, and watered gases are stored in 55-gallon drums that are collected by Heritage Environmental. Heritage transfers the material to Lone Star Industries in Greencastle, Ind. Lone Star uses these materials as recycled fuel for their cement kiln during the manufacturing process of cement and concrete products. Waste by-products fulfill 80 per - cent of Lone Star's fuel needs. n The fluid used for cleaning parts in the TS shop is collected by Crystal Kleen, a sister company of Heritage Environmental, for use in their HCC Reuse Program. The recycled solvent is used as an ingredient in a manufacturing process.Regenstrief adds funding for health care system work The Regenstrief Foundation and Purdue will expand their partner - ship in designing a new prescrip - tion for the nation's health care system. The foundation, which helped create the University's Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineer - ing with a $3 million gift in 2005, is investing $11 million more over the next five years, President France A. C\u00f3rdova announced April 3 at the President's Execu - tive Roundtable Luncheon at the Indianapolis Marriott Down - town. The Purdue center's charge is to use systems engineering, management, science and infor - mation technology to improve patient safety and patient care. \"We have seen how research at Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering in Discovery Park is helping address inefficiencies in this nation's $2 trillion health care system,\" C\u00f3rdova said. \"Re - searchers are addressing patient scheduling, telemedicine, patient safety and other areas of the complex health care system. And we are confident Purdue will play a major role in offering solutions to make health care delivery more efficient, effective and affordable for all Americans.\" Steven Witz, Regenstrief Center director and Purdue's St. Vincent Health Chair of Healthcare Engineering, said the additional funding will help the center expand its focus on three key areas of research \u2014 health education and learning technolo - gies, systems analyses of health care delivery and patient- outcome assessment. The grant to the Purdue cen - ter also will provide seed funding for smaller research projects and help sponsor annual conferences that highlight best practices and promote collaboration among health care professionals, faculty and students.April 18, 2008 12 Gifts, programs focus on access, success A number of gifts from Purdue friends and alumni have helped start the Access and Success cam - paign, and seven efforts designed to help fulfill the campaign's vi - sion have been announced. Charles Wallrodt of Glen El - lyn, Ill., a 1963 electrical engi - neering graduate, contributed $5 million for electrical and com - puter engineering. Patricia Schreiner of West Lafayette, a 1976 graduate in political science, donated $1.8 million to physics. Judith Heisserman of Fair - land, Ind., is giving $1.7 mil - lion to the School of V eterinary Medicine. A $3.2 million bequest from the estate of the late Alfred and Eva Mathiesen is to establish a scholarship for students with high financial need. Alfred Mathiesen earned a master's in education from Purdue in 1968. A $1.3 million anonymous donation will support a scholar - ship for electrical engineering students. T om and Sandy Malott of Sanibel, Fla., and Alpharetta, Ga., who have donated $1.1 million during their lifetimes, have desig - nated their latest gifts, totaling ap - proximately $500,000, to support international opportunities and reward innovation within me - chanical engineering. T om Malott earned his bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1962. About two-thirds of the money raised will go to scholar - ships for students at all Purdue campuses. The rest will go to support programs in K-12 grades and help students succeed after they enroll. Seven program initiatives In addition to providing support for general scholarships and ongoing programs for all Purdue campuses, the University is launching seven initiatives at the West Lafayette campus, said Pamela Horne, assistant vice president for enrollment manage - ment and dean of admissions. n Purdue Promise: The Purdue Promise ensures a Purdue education to Indiana students whose families earn $40,000 or less and who meet the require - ments of the Twenty-First Cen - tury Scholars Program. Purdue will combine grant aid and work- study funding to meet financial need for four years without the need for a loan. Purdue Promise includes academic and social support. The first recipients will start class in fall 2009. About 200 students a year will be enrolled, and by 2013, Horne said, she expects 880 students on campus will be part of this program. n The Purdue Marquis Schol - arship Program: The program helps Indiana students whose families earn $40,000-$70,000 and who qualify for minimal or no state and federal aid. The aver - age income for Purdue students' families is $70,000, and assistance will be provided on a sliding scale. The first scholarships will be available in fall 2009. n For top students: T o attract and retain the best talent for Purdue and the state of Indiana, new Presidential and Trustee scholarships will reach out to high-achieving students. The first recipients will start class this fall. n Boilermaker Common Reading Effort: Incoming stu - dents, student leaders, faculty, staff and county residents will be enrolled in what is hoped to be the largest common reading expe - rience in the nation, Horne said.\"This common reading pro - gram will help prepare students for the rigors of Purdue before they even arrive on campus,\" Horne said. \"Our goal is to get students in the habit of reading and thinking critically before they begin their college careers. We also hope to bring an author of a book to campus to kick off the program and have events throughout the year in which a book is applied in many contexts and disciplines.\" The program will begin in fall 2009. n Learning communities: These ongoing academic pro - grams allow students to enroll in several of the same courses and live on the same residence hall floors. They will draw on the common reading program. n The College Guide: This initiative will place recent Purdue graduates in high schools across Indiana to promote college as an option. The project, beginning as early as fall 2009, would focus on at least 10 Indiana high schools with low college-going rates. \"Over the course of multiple years, we will help thousands of Indiana residents enroll in col - lege,\" Horne said n Boiler Gold Rush: A Boiler Gold Rush scholarship program will pay the cost for a weeklong Purdue orientation program for low-income, first-time Purdue students. The goal is to double the scholarship program to reach 500 students. Donations made now will be applied to this August's orientation program. The money from the cam - paign will be placed in an endowment to ensure the aid and programs will be available yearly. The goal is to have the project fully funded in seven years.
