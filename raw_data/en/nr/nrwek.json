Nosodes are often prescribed by homeopaths as vaccine alternatives, despite the lack of evidence for their effectiveness. The new labeling standard for these products will include a much stronger warning against using these products in place of vaccines. This follows initial label changes in June of 2013 brought about by Bad Science Watch's 2013 Stop Nosodes campaign. The change to the homeopathic cough, cold, and flu preparations approval process means that Health Canada will no longer approve specific health claims for these products unless they are accompanied by scientific evidence. There is no indication if previously approved products will require label changes. Approval is granted by the Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate (NNHPD) at Health Canada. While Bad Science Watch applauds these changes and sees them as a victory for organized science advocacy in Canada, they illustrate that the Minister of Health has entirely missed the point of criticisms. \"Homeopaths will continue to be able to prescribe nosodes as vaccines despite the new label warnings,\" says Bad Science Watch board chair Michael Kruse. \"This will not stop them trying to prevent serious childhood disease with useless sugar pills.\" On the subject of the cough preps, Kruse was even stronger in his criticism: \"This one change ignores the much larger problem with the approval process. There is no scientific evidence that homeopathic preparations are good for any indication; you can just produce an entry from an old homeopathic drug book and get your product approved. The approval process is seriously flawed.\" Bad Science Watch is continuing to push for reform at the NNHPD at Health Canada to protect Canadians from dubious and ineffective natural health products and regulation.
