My journey into meditation has at best been slow and at worst, sporadic or non existent. I love the idea of it and the underlying principles and benefits of it but I just can't seem to commit to a daily practice. The best I have achieved was 24 days straight during COVID using my favourite guided meditation app, Insight Timer. It's exciting to see the consecutive days get longer and longer but as soon as I miss one day, it's back to square one and the motivation can slip away. So why do I long for something I feel I'm no good at? I have found what people say to be true. That even just 5 minutes of meditation a day, can really help ease stress and change your mindset. I notoriously have monkey mind and like many people these days, just can't seem to switch off from the multitude of things I should/could/have/want to be doing. Especially at bed time, those thoughts just kick into overdrive and I can lie awake for hours before finally falling asleep. In saying that, when I have committed to a regular, albeit short term practice, I have truly noticed a difference in my outlook and general wellbeing. And for something that was first found spoken of in written form in about 1500 BCE in India, and continues to be an integral part of not only many religions, but is also practised by those who are neither spiritual nor religious as a way of easing stress and clearing their mind, we know there must be something in it. So how can you celebrate World Meditation Day? Although I have spoken of my own practice where I follow a guided meditation, there are so many different ways in which you can practice if this does not work for you. The best way is to set aside some time for yourself where you can clear your mind, relax and focus on your breath. This may be by sitting quietly somewhere, either at home or somewhere outside, maybe near the ocean or surrounded by trees. On the other hand, you may prefer a more physical kind of meditation, one where you can just zone out, such as yoga or walking in nature. Whichever way you choose to celebrate World Meditation Day, just remember that Meditation is most beneficial when practised regularly, so why not set yourself a reminder to meditate once a day, every day for the rest of the week and see how you feel.", "sitename": "Bliss & Balance", "date": "2021-05-21", "cleaned_text": "Posted on May 21 2021 Today is World Meditation Day, a day that reminds us to slow down and take a moment for ourselves in this crazy busy life we lead.
