Rather than treating symptoms as they arise, our methodology allows us to help you prevent chronic diseases before they arise and (in many cases) reverse those that already have. The more you know about your body, the more effective your treatment plan will be. Our therapies are founded on evidence-based and time-tested interventions that help to support your body's inherent capacity for self-healing. Contact us at [(917) 477-3538](tel:+19174773538) to set up an appointment today. Hi I'm Doctor Robert Kachko and welcome to New York Center for Integrative Health. At our clinic we offer comprehensive holistic health care that allows each individual to feel heard and understood.
