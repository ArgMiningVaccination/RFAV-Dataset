Objectives --- To examine variation in the use of C AM among REI populations, and assess the influence of cultural heritage and acces s to medical care on CAM use Conceptual Model --- Adapted Behavioral Model of Vu lnerable Population with added REI domains. Method --- Data are from Survey of Health of Adults , the Population and the Environment (SHAPE) collected in Hennepin County, M innesota in 2002. The final sample consists of 9,959 respondents with 2,794 fro m racial and ethnic minorities and 1,007 interviews were completed in languages other than English. The outcome measures were the use of five CAM therapies in the previous 12 months. Results --- Overall, 42% of the adults in the total population used at least one of the five CAM therapies in the past 12 month. CAM use is prev alent among REI populations, particularly among American Indians, Asians and Whi tes. The use of individual CAM varies across racial and ethnic populations and the pattern of use conforms to the racial and ethnic origins of the modalities. Cultural heri tage influences CAM use and the level of influence is stronger for culturally-relevant CA M. Lack of insurance coverage, delayed medical care and not having a physician's c linic as regular source of care are associated with a higher likelihood of CAM use. Lac k of access to conventional health care has a stronger influence on CAM use in some ra cial and ethnic groups. Lack of insurance coverage and barriers to needed medical c are play a larger role in the use of CAM among immigrants. Conclusion --- CAM has an important role in promoti ng culturally competent care particularly in REI populations. CAM may serve as a n alternative option for those lacking adequate access to medical care, particular ly among immigrants and people of racial and ethnic populations. iv Table of Contents LIST OF TABLES .................................... ................................................... ...................

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Section 1. Introduction and Specific Aims During the past decade, the U.S. population grew by 2.88 million on average each year, reaching 310,566,487 on January 1, 2011(U.S. Census, 2011). Along with this population growth, a noteworthy pattern is its chan ging profile. Based on the Census estimates, one third of US residents belong to a gr oup other than single-race non- Hispanic white in 2008 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008a). By 2050, nearly one-half of the total population in the US will be a member of a ra cial and ethnic population, and the \"minority\" population increase is projected to acco unt for nearly 90 percent of the total population growth over the next four and half decad es (U.S. Census Bureau, 2004, 2006). Furthermore, the number of foreign-born or immigran t population reached a record high of 38.5 million, double that of 1990, and accountin g for 12.5 percent of the total population, the highest percentage in eight decades (Gryn & Larsen, 2010; Malone, Baluja, Costanzo, & Davis, 2003). These significant changes of the racial, ethnic and immigrant (REI) population are in direct contrast to the current limited knowledge about health care practices and behaviors of REI people from diverse backgrounds. T hough a rapidly expanding body of literature has demonstrated the existence of signif icant health disparities and concerted efforts have been made on a number of fronts, there seems to be little progress toward eliminating these disparities over the past decade. Numerous studies have documented the pervasive, consistent and even widening gaps of health outcomes in Hispanics, Blacks, American Indians and Asian and Pacific Isla nders as compared to whites for some health conditions (Anachebe & Sutton, 2003; Ba skin, Ard, Franklin, & Allison, 2 2005; Chen, 2005; Cone, Richardson, Todd, Betancour Lowe, 2003; Crawley, 2005; Dominick Gonzalez, Lawrence, 2010; Duncan, 2005; St epanikova & Cook, 2004; Stevens & Shi, 2003; Tomson et al., 2008). As acknowledged by researchers, the reasons for health disparities are multiple and complex: coexisting an d inextricably connected factors that are biological, socio-cultural, economic, societal and structural in nature contribute to this problem. Though little is known about the extent to which varied proposals and endeavors have achieved their purposes, the majorit y of research efforts and discussions have focused on improving preventive care and clini cal outcomes, addressing social and economic circumstances, increasing quality of care, and enhancing health care access for the disadvantaged populations (Bach, 2005; Beach et al., 2006; Berk & Schur, 1998b; Blendon, Aiken, Freeman, & Corey, 1989; Burgess et al., 2008; Cohen, 2004; Evans & Evans, 2007; Hu, 2010; Institute of Medicine, 2002; Kelley, et al., 2005; Lillie-Blanton Hoffman, Rylko-Bauer Weinick, Zuvekas, & Cohen, 2000; Williams & J ackson, 2005). Few health services research studies focus on the use the ther apies and remedies indigenous to the tradition and culture of these diverse populations, specifically complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), the term used in this s tudy. 3 In many countries outside of the US, CAM is the tra ditional or \"conventional\" form of medical care and has been practiced for dec ades or centuries. CAM often serves as an indispensable and integrated primary care mod ality along with biomedical health care services in many parts of the globe (Chipfakac ha, 1994; Oyeneye, 1985; Workshop on Alternative Medicine at Chantilly VA, 1992). Whi le clinical research regarding efficacy and effectiveness are still lacking for ma ny of the CAM modalities, there is conclusive evidence from existing studies showing c lear and promising benefits of some CAM therapies in treating certain health conditions conventional medicine so far offers little solution to or comes with substantial side e ffects (Aker, Gross, Goldsmith, Su van Tuld er et al., 2000; Whiskey, Werneke, & Taylor, 2001). Through emphasizing health promoti on and encouraging cultivating body's healing potential, CAM has also been documen ted to contribute to patients' psychological and physical well being through self- healing motivations (Ritvo et al., 1999). Compared to conventional health care, CAM th erapies were less expensive and more cost effective (Ratcliffe, Thomas, MacPherson, & Brazier, 2006; Willich et al., 4 2006), especially for the vulnerable and REI popula tions without health insurance who face ever escalating health care costs. The use of CAM has grown in the United States (U.S. ) during the decade. In 1990, one-third of the population used some form of CAM therapies and by 1997, the prevalence had increased to 42%. In addition, 617 m illion visits were made to CAM providers in 1997, exceeding the total number of vi sits made to primary care physicians (Eisenberg et al., 1998; Eisenberg et al., 1993). I n 2002, over 60% of the adult population used some types of CAM if prayer specifically for h ealth reasons is included (Barnes, Powell-Griner, McFann, & Nahin, 2004). Accompanying the growth in use of CAM in the past d ecade, there has been an increasing role and emphasis on consumerism in heal th care. Consumers are actively seeking more health care options to manage their he alth conditions and spending significant out-of-pocket dollars on CAM. It was es timated that the total out-of-pocket expenditure of 27 billion dollars on CAM was equiva lent to the out-of-pocket expenditure for all physician services in 1997 (Eis enberg, et al., 1998). In responding to consumer demands, the American Hospital Association collaborated with Integrative Medicine, Inc., an information service company, to help hospitals incorporate CAM services (AHA, 2000). According to the Health Forum CAM survey, the number of hospitals offering CAM, increased from 8% in 1998 t o 16.7% in 2003, 26.5% in 2005, and 37% in 2008 (Allen & Fenwick, 2008; Health Foru m, 2003). These CAM therapies include massage therapy, acupuncture, meditation an d relaxation, Tai Chi, Yoga, Qi Gong, guided imagery, and biofeedback. 5 Increasing use of CAM and consumer's willingness to pay out-of-pocket for these services has prompted researchers to seek reasons f or the rise of CAM use and motivations underlying individuals' decision-making . From a broad social perspective, increasing migration and transmission of establishe d medicines from different parts of the globe, for example, Ayurvedic medicine and Traditio nal Chinese Medicine (Sharma, 1975; Unschuld, 1985) and the consumer movement in healthcare are two of the social changes occurring in the past 20 years (Coulter & W illis, 2004). Many CAM therapies originated from regions outside of the United State s. For example, acupuncture and herbal medicine constitute important components of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and have been practiced in China and other pa rts of Asia for centuries (Gao, 1997). When people immigrate from Asia to the U.S., they carry the traditions, concepts and beliefs about health and health care, and pract ices of folk remedies with them. At the same time, an increasing number of people are being asked to act as consumers through the movement toward consumer-driven health care (Du renberger, 2005a, 2005b; Fine, 2000; Vinn, 2000). Patients are more actively engag ed in their own health care choices searching health care information, selecting provid ers, and defining health values. From an individual's perspective, research in the U nited States and abroad suggest several major reasons for increased CAM use . First, it has been argued that dissatisfaction with the outcome of conventional me dicine in treating certain chronic medical conditions is the main contributor for peop le resorting to CAM, because CAM is perceived to be more efficacious in treating chroni c conditions (Astin, 1998; Carey, 2006; Downer & Peay, 1 996; Sirois, 2002). Second, individuals may seek CAM because they believe in th eir own responsibility for achieving 6 and maintaining health. These people view CAM as em bodying treatment modalities that emphasize personal autonomy, and thus are more like ly to encourage health-promoting behaviors, such as using preventive care, eating a low-fat diet, taking a daily multivitamin, and engaging physical activities (Mur ray & Shepherd, 1993; Ritvo, et al., 1999; Robinson, Crane, Davidson, & Steiner, 2002; S irois & Gick, 2002). Third, rather than being dissatisfied with conventional medicine, CAM users consider their values, beliefs and philosophical orientations being congru ent with CAM (Astin, 1998; Siahpush, 1999). However, these proposed reasons are based on studies of CAM use by the general population; patterns and motivations for CAM use am ong subgroups, especially racial and ethnic people and immigrants remains largely un known. As stated in the strategic plan of the National Cen ter of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) for addressing racial and ethnic health disparities, \"While recent national surveys document a substanti al and growing use of CAM by Americans as a whole, little is known about CAM use in minority populations, either by lay members or their care providers. Such research can shed light on how traditional beliefs shape health behaviors and whether they con flict with or complement conventional health care or methods of health promo tion and disease prevention\" (NCCAM, 2002: p2). The purpose of this study is to gain an understandi ng of the variation and patterns of practices of CAM within REI populations. More im portantly, it goes beyond race and ethnicity classifications to assess whether and how cultural-specific factors, especially cultural heritage and acculturation influence CAM u se. Furthermore, this study seeks to 7 determine the association between health care acces s and CAM use in REI populations. The specific aims are: 1. Examine variation in CAM use among racial and et hnic populations 2. Evaluate the extent to which cultural heritage a nd acculturation are associated with variation in CAM use 3. Assess the association of access to conventional health care and CAM use among REI populations This research applies the adapted Behavioral Model of Vulnerable Populations (BMVP) and is the first study employing this concep tual model that is relevant to vulnerable populations in examining CAM use in REI populations. This study uses a unique dataset that includes AHRQ priority populati ons of minorities, women, elderly, those living in inner cities and persons needing ch ronic care. This study builds on the previous and ongoing research of the author, her ad viser and committee members on CAM use, health care access and disparities in vuln erable populations and will lead to future investigations of CAM use in relation to hea lth behavior and the use of conventional health care practices, how CAM influen ces health care outcomes and evaluations of the role of CAM in reducing health c are disparities among vulnerable populations. The results of the study will contribu te to the health services research literature on the patterns of CAM use among the inc reasingly growing REI population in the U.S., particularly the variation of CAM use wit h cultural specific factors. It can provide health care practitioners with additional u nderstanding of health care practices among diverse populations that may lead to the prov ision of culturally competent care 8 and it may inform policy discussions regarding the role CAM plays in health care access and the reduction of health care disparities. Section 2. Background and Significance 1.2.1 Overview of Complementary and Alternative Med icine (CAM) Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) repres ents a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and pro ducts that are not presently considered to be part of conventional medicine therapies (NCCA M, 2002). As the name indicates, CAM complements or substitutes for conventional med icine commonly practiced in the U.S.; it is commonly defined as interventions not t aught widely in the medical schools and not generally available in hospitals (Astin, 19 98; Eisenberg, et al., 1998; Eisenberg, et al., 1993). However, CAM is increasingly taught in U.S. medical schools and included in medical practices, making the common definition problematic. In addition, in many countries outside of the U.S., CAM is the tradition al or conventional form of medical care and considered to be indigenous folk medicine of countries. Nevertheless, the term \"CAM\" is used in this study to represent all therap ies and practices outside the predominant biomedical profession encompassing heal th and healing systems, and their intrinsic theories and beliefs. CAM is also the ter m most recognized and commonly used in the majority of research and thus adopted in thi s study to maintain consistency with the literature. Five CAM Therapies In survey research, the most frequently used and co mmonly included CAM therapies are chiropractic care, acupuncture, spiri tual healing, herbal medicine, relaxation 9 techniques, massage, biofeedback, and homeopathic t reatment (Barnes, et al., 2004; Eisenberg, et al., 1998). The current study examine s the use of five CAM therapies as outlined in the Survey of the Health of Adults, the Population and the Environment (SHAPE): chiropractic, acupuncture, spiritual heali ng, herbal medicine, and meditation/relaxation therapies. These therapies br oadly represent the five categories (alternative medical system, biologically based the rapies, manipulative and body-based therapies, mind-body therapies, and herbal products ) included in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the Centers fo r Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Center for Health Statistics (NC HS) in 2002. Chiropractic Chiropractic originated at the turn of 19 th century in the United States. It is based on the idea that manipulation of the spine can reli eve pressure on the nerves to relieve pain and alleviate illness (Hansen & Triano, 2000). Research evidence indicates that chiropractic care can help patients with back, shou lder and neck pain and most people seek chiropractic care for musculoskeletal conditio ns (Cherkin & Mootz, 1998). Clinical evidence indicates that chiropractic is effective f or musculoskeletal pain, such as low back pain, neck pain and headache (Aker, et al., 19 96; Anderson, 1992; Assendelft, et al., 1995; Hurwitz, et al., 1996; Koes, et al., 1996). Chiropractors are licensed in all 50 states and are the third largest body of health professionals in the United States, after medical d octors and dentists (Hansen & Triano, 2000). Chiropractic is also the most common form of CAM that is covered by insurance. Medicare, Medicaid, worker's compensation systems, employee benefit programs and most insurance plans, including conventional insura nce plans, preferred provider 10 organizations (PPOs), and point-of-service plans co ver chiropractic services and most states mandate the coverage (Faass, 2001; Jensen, M ootz, Shekelle, Cherkin, & Roychoudhury, 1997). Acupuncture Acupuncture is a component of the Chinese medical s ystem which was developed more than 5000 years ago and has spread throughout other Asian countries (Sheikh & Sheikh, 1989). It is guided by Traditional Chinese Medicine theory to diagnose and treat patients by inserting and manipulating fine metalli c needles in the acu-points (specific external body locations) located on the meridians ( pathways where body organs are interconnected). Numerous studies have been conduct ed on the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating osteoarthritis, chemotherap y-induced nausea, asthma, back pain, bladder instability and migraine headaches (Arseni, Zbaganu, & Rosca, 1988; Chang, Wu, & Huang, 1993; Chu, Wu, Lin, & Wang, 2005; Emmo ns & Otto, 2005; Epstein, 1994; Ezzo Fung, Chow, nn, Milbrandt, Little, Mason, 1999; Mayer, Philp, 1999; Vickers Vickers, According to a NIH consensus statement (1997), acupuncture is effective for post -operative and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, postoperative pain and dental pain. Acupuncture was also found in some research to be an acceptable alternative or ad junct treatment in cases of addiction, stroke rehabilitation, menstrual cramps, tennis elb ow, fibromyalgia, myofasical pain, and 2002; Trinh, et al., 2004; Wayne et al., 2005). Spiritual Healing Traditional healers are those who practice healing services consistent with the culture and belief system of their patients. Tradit ional healing represents a body of knowledge about how to treat illness that has grown out of the historical experiences of cultural groups (Thorogood, 1990) . In most racial and ethnic traditions and healing practices, medicine and religion are considered ins eparable and many traditional healers also practice shamanism, which considers illness a result of spiritual or other outside forces and so those forces are also used in diagnos is and treatment (McClenon, 1993). Practicing traditional healers are found worldwide and have roots in many European, African, Asian and Asian American folk pr actices. Spiritual healing is also most likely to be practiced among racial and ethnic groups, such as Blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians and Asians (Cockerham, 2004). For example, rootwork is a type of traditional medical belief and practice that dis tinguishes natural from unnatural causes of illness in Blacks; it is practiced particularly by those who live in inner cities and southern rural areas (Fishman, Bobo, Kosub, & Womeo du, 1993). Curanderismo is a traditional form of the Hispanic healing system tha t mixes components of medieval Spanish medicine and Catholicism with elements of N ative American medicine and healing (Gomez & Gomez, 1985; Marsh & Hassanein, 19 88). Native American traditions involve shamanic healing together with herbal remed ies, sweating, and purging in treating diseases (Kramer, 1992). In Asia, Traditio nal Chinese Medicine (TCM), its variations, and Ayurveda medicine constitute tradit ional healing systems. TCM was 12 developed along with religion, philosophy, shamanis m and tribal culture (Unschuld, 1986). Besides acupuncture, other treatments in TCM include moxibustion (dried or powdered leaves of artemesia vulgaris (ai ye) in the form of (chopped) sticks are applie d on or in proximity to the skin), Taiji (an ancient martial art with gentle and relaxed movement for balance and strength), cupping (a bamb oo or glass cup is overturned and placed onto certain points or areas in the body aft er the inside air is warmed to create vacuum), Qigong (using breath, movement, and medita tion to cleanse, strengthen, and circulate the vital like energy and blood) and herb al medicine. Though certain therapies that are parts of traditional healing systems have demonstrated effectiveness, evidence of the efficacy of other traditional healing methods h ave been scant (Barnes, 2003; Lemelson, 2004; Miles & True, 2003). Herbal Medicine Herbs include any form of a plant or plant product, including roots, stem, leaves, flowers, seeds, etc (Winslow & Kroll, 1998). Some h erbal products, such as those used in TCM, may contain animal products and minerals (Rotb latt & Ziment, 2002). Herbs have been used for centuries to prevent and treat diseas es and to improve health and are still being widely used in many parts of the world (Halbe rstein, 2005). A number of surveys reported that a large percentage of the U.S. popula tion use herbal products to treat medical conditions or maintain and improve health ( Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1995; Harnack, Rydell, & Stang, 2 001; Rafferty, A limited number of randomized clinical trials cond ucted on a small proportion of herbs showed positive and promising evidence of eff icacy for garlic, Ginkgo biloba, saw 13 palmetto, and St. John's wort for treating hypercho lesterolemia, dementia, urinary track symptoms, and depression respectively (Chang, Dao, & Shao, 2005; Ernst, 2005; et et al., 2003; W hiskey, et al., 2001; Williams et al., 2000; Wilt, Ishani, & Mac Donald, 2002). Meditation and Relaxation Meditation and relaxation therapies are considered part of mind-body interventions that use a variety of techniques to e nhance the mind's capacity to affect bodily function and symptoms and bring about a stat e of self-awareness and inner calm (Cardoso, de Souza, Camano, & Leite, 2004). These i nclude techniques such as centering (a relaxation and concentration exercise in which the emphasis is on abdominal breathing and the use of key words) progressive muscular relaxation, a procedure whereb y individuals contract particular muscle groups before releasing tension mindfulness meditation - detached awareness of expe rience transcendental meditation - a popular form of mantr a meditation Sahaja meditation - passive witnessing of thoughts Meditation and relaxation therapies were found to b e the second most frequently used CAM therapies in 1997 with 16 percent of the popula tion reporting using the strategies (Eisenberg, et al., 1998). Evidence for the therape utic effectiveness of meditation and relaxation therapy indicates its beneficial effect of reducing stress and adjunctive role in treating chronic low back pain, rheumatoid and oste oarthritis, tension headache, and 14 reducing pain Fydrich, Turk, 1992; Hadhazy van Tulder, et al., 2000). 1.2.2 CAM Use in the General Population Pattern and Prevalence of CAM Use Though CAM has been widely practiced for an extende d period of time throughout the world, the prevalence of CAM use in the general population of the United States was poorly documented until the publication of the aforementioned milestone study by Eisenberg and his colleagues at Harvard Me dical School (Eisenberg, et al., 1998; Eisenberg, et al., 1993). This study reporte d that 34% of the survey respondents, giving a national estimate of 61 million people, us ed some form of CAM therapies in 1990. Among these users, one third visited a CAM pr ovider. Additionally, the average number of visits among those who visited a CAM prov ider during the preceding year was 19 times (Eisenberg, et al., 1993). The follow-up survey conducted in 1997 reported a 65% increase in the number of CAM therapies used, f rom an estimate of 577 therapies per 1000 population to 953 per 1000 between 1990 an d 1997. A significantly higher proportion of users (46 percent in 1997 vs. 36 perc ent in 1990) visited a CAM provider. The average number of visits in the prior year was 16 times. Most of the expenditures were paid out-of-pocket. Using the average per-visi t prices derived from an RBRVS (Resource-Based Relative Value Scale) system, the a uthors estimated the total expenses 15 for CAM in 1997 to be $34.4 billion, which was comp arable with the projected out-of- pocket expenses for all physician services (Eisenbe rg, et al., 1998). Since Eisenberg's studies, more national surveys and studies have been conducted and documented the prevalence of CAM use in the Uni ted States (Astin, 1998; Barnes, et al., 2004; Burg, Kosch, Neims, & Stoller, 1998; Bur ge, Albright, Research Network of South, 2002; Druss & Rosenheck, 1999; El der, Olde ndick et al., 2000; Paramore, 1997). Assessed prevalence rates vary for several reasons: differences in the definition of CAM, number and type of CAM included in the surveys , survey mode (telephone interview, self-administered questionnaire, in-pers on interview), sample design, and the languages used in the survey. Regardless, it is cle ar that CAM is being used broadly in the general U.S. population. Profiles of CAM users in the general population hav e been found to be predominantly female, middle aged, having higher th an average education and income, and with more chronic conditions and poorer health status than the general population (Astin, 1998; Barnes, et al., 2004; Bausell, et al., 1993; Ni, et al., 2002; Paramore, 1997). Reasons for Seeking CAM Studies conducted in England, Germany, Canada, Aust ralia and United States suggested several reasons for seeking CAM care. Fur nham and his colleagues conducted a series of three studies in England comparing a gr oup of patients who chose to visit a general practitioner and another matched group of p atients who chose to use a 16 homeopath. All three studies found that the homeop ath group was much more critical and skeptical about and more dissatisfied with the efficacy of conventional medicine (Furnham & Bhagrath, 1993; Furnham & Forey, 1994; F urnham & Smith, 1988). The above three studies were restricted to relatively s mall number of British patients and focused specifically on patients of homeopath. Othe r two studies conducted in Australia and Germany found similar patterns of CAM users, wh o were less satisfied in conventional medical treatment, but not necessarily the medical experience or health care encounter (Furnham & Kirkcaldy, 1996; McGregor & Pe ay, 1996). Findings from these two studies are also based on small non-probability samples. The Australian study compared a group of 85 patients from a health cente r specializing in the Touch for Health therapy with a group of 81 respondents from the com munity. The results of the German study are based on a sample of 202 patients (respon se rate was 51%) from several therapeutic centers. Another Australian study examining the determinants of attitudes towards CAM randomly sampled 787 non-institutionalized adults a nd found that neither dissatisfaction with the outcome of conventional medicine nor exper iences with the medical encounters explained CAM use. Rather, faith and beliefs in nat ural remedies, consumerism, and individual responsibilities were associated with po sitive attitudes towards CAM (Siahpush, 1999). Similar results were found in a s ample of 1035 randomly selected individuals who had agreed to participate in mail s urveys and who lived throughout the United States (Astin, 1998). Astin found that peopl e used CAM because their personal values and philosophical orientations toward health and life were congruous with CAM. Users were more likely to have a transformational e xperience that changed their world 17 views and were more likely to be classified as \"cul tural creatives,\" a group of individuals that emerged over the last generation who are ident ified by their commitment to environmentalism, self actualization and spirituali ty and their loving the foreign and exotic (Ray & Anderson, 2000). This study and anoth er national survey also indicated that people sought CAM care because of its perceive d benefits (Astin, 1998; Barnes, et al., 2004). 1.2.3 CAM Use among REI Populations Although increasing CAM use has been well-documente d among the general population, utilization patterns among racial and e thnic population groups in the United States are less clear. The majority of studies anal yzing national surveys of CAM use either did not report CAM use among racial and ethn ic groups (Druss & Rosenheck, 1999; Paramore, 1997), excluded non-English speakin g respondents and thus did not accurately represent racial and ethnic populations (Eisenberg, et al., 1998; Eisenberg, et al., 1993), or included some racial and ethnic grou ps and left others out (Alferi, Antoni, Ironson, Kilbourn, & Carver, 2001; Allen, Cushman, Morris, Feldman, Wade, McMahon, et al., 2000; Arcury, Bernard, Jordan, & Cook, 1996 ; Astin, 1998; et al., 2002; 2005; 2000; L ee, Lin, Wrensch, Adler, & Eisenberg, 2000; Shapiro & Gong, 2002). The few national studies that included representati ve racial and ethnic populations gave inconsistent reports of patterns of CAM. Keith et al. (2005) analyzed the data from 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and fo und variations in seeing a 18 practitioner of 11 CAM therapies across racial and ethnic groups with the highest prevalence rate among Asians (8%) and lowest among Blacks (3%). The study did not report the prevalence of the use of different CAM t herapies. Barnes et al. (2004) studied the use of 10 most commonly used CAM therapies base d on National Health Interview Survey and found that the highest prevalence rate w as among Blacks (71%) and Asians (62%) if prayer for health reasons and megavitamin therapy were included. Excluding these two CAM therapies, CAM use was most prevalent among Asians (43%). Mackenzie et al. (2003) analyzed a subset of data f rom the 1995 National Comparative Survey of Minority Health Care of the Commonwealth Fund and found that the prevalence of CAM utilization does not differ by et hnicity. Several reasons may account for the discrepancies found in the above studies, s uch as differences in types and number of CAM therapies included in the surveys, varied sa mpling designs, differences in statistical adjustments made in the analyses to acc ommodate complex sampling design, differences in the time when the survey was conduct ed, and whether practitioners were consulted in the use of CAM therapies. Studies that used convenience samples, focused on s ingle therapies, studied one specific racial and ethnic population group or subj ects with certain health conditions found CAM was commonly used among racial and ethnic populations. Research suggests that race and ethnicity accounted for the differenc es in use in some studies but not others, so the utilization patterns of CAM across racial an d ethnic groups remains unclear (Alferi, et al., 2001; Allen, Cushman, Morris, Feld man, Wade, McMahon, et al., 2000; Arcury, et al., 1996; Bair, et al., 2002; Buchwald, et al., 2000; Cushman, et al., 1999; Dole, et al., 2000; Factor-Litvak, et al., 2001; Ke egan, 2000; Lee, et al., 2000; Shapiro & 19 Gong, 2002). The number of studies of CAM use among immigrants is small and the documentation is fairly limited in terms of sample population and size and CAM therapies studied (Allen, Cushman, Morris, Feldman, Wade, MaMahon, et al., 2000; Garces, Scarinci, Harrison, 2006; Kim, Han, Kim, & Duong, 2002; Rao, 2006). Except one study indicating that immigration status is ass ociated with 19 times higher of likelihood of herbal use among a group of 322 prima ry care patients compared with non- immigration status (Kuo, Hawley, Weiss, Balkrishnan , & Volk, 2004), all of the above- mentioned studies of CAM use among racial and ethni c groups did not distinguish immigrants from non-immigrants. In addition, lack o f measures for acculturation and inadequate consideration of CAM therapies that are culturally specific prevent a clearer picture of CAM use among REI populations. 1.2.4 Cultural Roots of CAM Therapies Many CAM therapies originated from histories and ph ilosophies that are rooted to specific ethnicities and cultures. For example, acu puncture is a part of TCM and chiropractic was founded and developed in the Unite d States (Hansen & Triano, 2000; Unschuld, 1985). CAM use is inevitably influenced b y traditions and culture. Though the concept of culture is broad and the meaning varies in different contexts, there is some consensus of its definition: \"1) Culture is a body of knowledge, attitudes, skills for dealing with the physical and social environment th at are passed on from one generation to the next; 2) Cultures have continuity and stabil ity, because each generation attempts to pass the culture on intact. 3) Cultures also change over time as the physical, social, political, and spiritual environments change.\" (Oet ting, Donnermeyer, Trimble, & Beauvais, 1998). 20 It has been proposed that the greater one identifie s with a specific culture, the more likely one will follow the traditional beliefs of health and illness and engage in health practices that are congruent with one's ethn o-cultural heritage (Spector, 2004). Buchwald et al. (2000) surveyed a random sample of 869 American Indian and Alaska Native primary care patients and found that those w ho used traditional health practices, such as herbal remedies, smudging, or specialized h ealing or sweat lodge ceremonies were more likely to indicate following the native w ay of life than those who did not use traditional health practices. A rich medical and cu ltural anthropology literature on cultural belief points to its relationship with per ceptions of health and illnesses and treatment choices (Caralis, Davis, Wright, & Marcia l, 1993; Meleis, Lipson, & Paul, 1992; Nilchaikovit, Hill, & Holland, 1993; Pachter, 1994). It is reasonable to speculate that the degree to which one holds to cultural heri tage influences the use of culturally- related health care practices. Yet, I found no stud y that has examined the association of cultural heritage and CAM beyond race and ethnicity . Furthermore, few studies examined the influence of acculturation on use of CAM. Given the cultural origins of certain CAM therapies , such as acupuncture and Ayurveda from Asia, shamanism from South America, homeopathy from Europe, chiropractic from North America, and herbal medicine from various wor ld locations, one might speculate that these therapies will be more commonly practice d in their respective racial and ethnic related cultural groups. In addition, acculturation - adjustment and integration to a new culture through immigration and exposure to a diffe rent culture through cross-cultural contacts (Redfield, Linton, & Herskowits, 1936) may influence health practices, including the use of the CAM and conventional thera pies. 21 Pachter (1994) classified those who were more likel y to adhere to ethnocultural beliefs and behaviors as those who were recent immi grants, lived in ethnic enclaves, preferred to use their native tongue, were educated in their country of origin, migrated back and forth to their country of origin, and main tained contact with older individuals who maintain a high degree of ethnic identity (p.69 2). A survey of 3,623 adult Mexican Americans found that those who consulted folk medic ine practitioners in the past 12 months were more likely to be foreign born than tho se who did not (Higginbotham, Trevino, & Ray, 1990). However, a study of 70 self- identified Mexican undergraduate and graduate students, of which the majority were b orn in the United States, suggested that Hispanic health care beliefs and practices wer e common among this group of highly assimilated and educated women (Lopez, 2005). Unfor tunately, the later study did not compare health beliefs and practices between those who were and were not born in the U.S. and the low response rate (35%) should be cons idered when interpreting the findings. Thus far, little is known about the preva lence of culturally relevant therapy use among people with specific cultural origins and the influence of acculturation and assimilation on CAM use. 1.2.5 Barriers to Conventional Health Care and thei r Relation to CAM There is abundant evidence showing that REI populat ions face disparities in health care access (e.g., lower rates of health insurance coverage, service use, unmet health care needs) as well as income disparities that impact ac cess (Ayanian, Weissman, Schneider, Ginsburg, & Weinick, et al., 2000). For example, Ayanian et al. (2000) found that people without health insurance were more likely to report not seeing a physician when needed due to cost. Commonly used indicators for access or lack of access to health care include health insurance coverage, regular source of care a nd unmet health care need (Ayanian, et al., 2000; Berk & Schur, 1998a; Blendon, et al., 19 89; US Department of Health and Human Services, 2003). Health insurance plans do not routinely cover CAM t herapies, with the exception of chiropractic care which is commonly covered by gove rnment and private health insurances (Cherkin et al., 2002; Cleary-Guida, Okv at, Oz, & Ting, 2001). Some private health plans cover acupuncture treatments with limi tations (e.g. pain management with a referral requirement, restrictions in the number of visits) (Weeks, 2001). No insurance plan covers traditional healing, herbal medicine, o r meditation and relaxation therapies. CAM users pay out-of-pocket for these therapies and services. Thus for those with conventional health insurance, CAM use involves ext ra cost. For those without health insurance coverage, CAM is relatively less expensiv e and thus might serve as an alternative option to care for those unable to affo rd conventional health care. Findings are mixed regarding the relationship between health ins urance and CAM. Ni et al. (2002) found that CAM use was higher among persons who had insurance than among those who did not, but the results were not statistically significant after adjusting for age, gender and education. Paramore (Paramore, 1997) did not detect any difference in insurance coverage between CAM users and non-users, whereas the results of a national survey indicated that being uninsured was a signifi cant predictor of CAM use (Mackenzie, Taylor, Bloom, Hufford, & Johnson, 2003 ). 23 To the best of our knowledge, there has been no stu dy examining whether and how the different sources of care, such as physician's office, community health center, emergency rooms relate to CAM use. Though unmet hea lth care needs due to cost has been suggested to be associated with CAM (Pagan & P auly, 2005), studies on how CAM use relates to unmet health care needs due to other health care access barriers, such as transportation, ability to schedule convenient appo intments, and availability of interpreter services, have been lacking. Furthermore, no compar ison has been made between different racial, ethic, and immigrant populations regarding how conventional health care access relates to CAM use. A larger proportion of REI populations have low inc omes, lack access to health care, and are uninsured than the general population (Cohen, 2004; Lillie-Blanton & Hoffman, 2005). This study seeks to understand whet her and how CAM use serves as an alternative choice for different REI populations wh o need care but lack access to or are not able to afford conventional care. The results o f the study will provide some evidence to inform policy and funding decisions on the role of CAM in meeting health care needs of REI populations with a long-term agenda of reduc ing health care disparities, a goal set by Healthy People 2010 and Agency of Health Care an d Quality (AHRQ). Previous studies examining CAM use either treated d ifferent modalities as one single category or analyzed individual CAM therapie s separately. Though it has been suggested that users of different CAM therapies hav e distinct yet certain common characteristics and are more likely to use conventi onal health services, no study has evaluated the factors influencing the use of CAM th erapies jointly by taking the correlations across different therapies into consid eration 24 Kelner & Wellman, 1997a, 1997b). This study extends the existing literature by considering jointly the decision of to use any of t he five CAM therapies. This study uses multivariate probit modeling (MVP) to recognize the correlations of the choices of CAM across modalities by taking account of the unobserv ed characteristics of multiple CAM choices of the individuals. This research uses the dataset collected from the Survey of Health of Adults, the Population and the Environment (SHAPE) in Hennepin County - a large urban county in Minnesota. SHAPE has many features lacking in previ ous national studies. Unique characteristics of SHAPE include random sampling of the population, over-sampling of racial and ethnic groups, and inclusion of non-Engl ish speaking people as the survey was available in four languages other than English. Que stions were asked regarding birth place, number of years living in the U.S., beliefs about the importance of one's cultural heritage, and access to conventional health care to allow for the REI specific analyses of the three specific aims proposed in this study. 25 CHAPTER 2. CONCEPTUAL MODEL This part consists three sections. Section 1 review s Andersen's health behavior model; Section 2 introduces the Behavioral Model of Vulnerable Population (BMVP), the revised and expanded model based on Andersen's mode l of health behavior and includes a discussion of the REI domains specific to this st udy; Section 3 describes a working model to examine this study's three specific aims. Section 1. Andersen's Health Behavioral Model The widely-applied conventional health behavior mo del was originally developed by Andersen in the 1960s and has undergone several revisions to explain how and why people use health care services (Aday, 1993; Aday & Andersen, 1974; Andersen, 1968; Andersen & Newman, 19 73; Fleming & Andersen, 1986). It postulates that health service use depends on th ree sets of factors: predisposing, enabling, and need. The predisposing factors indica te an individual's tendency and propensity to seek health care, but not necessarily the direct reason for care use. It includes demographic, social structural, and health belief characteristics: age, gender, education, race and ethnicity, values, attitudes an d knowledge concerning health, illness and health services. The enabling component consist s of personal and community resources and conditions, which enable or impede th e realization of service use. Common research measures are income, health insurance, typ e of and access to a regular source of care, ratios of health personnel and facilities to the population, price of health services, region of residence and its urban-rural character. Besides the availability of resources, individuals have to perceive that they are ill or m ay be in danger of getting ill and in need 26 of health services. Thus, need factors represent th e most immediate cause of health service use and are generally measured by disabilit y days, symptoms, diagnoses, and general health status (Andersen, 1968; Andersen & N ewman, 1973; Andersen, Smedby, & Anderson, 1970). The three sets of components sug gest an explanatory process or causal ordering where predisposing characteristics, especially the demographic and social structural factors may be exogenous and thus influe nce enabling resources and perceiving illness as reflected in the need component (Anderse n & Newman, 1973; Andersen, et al., 1970). Since the development of the behavioral model more than forty years ago, numerous studies have applied the model to the use of various health services, ranging from ambulatory medical care, hospital care, emerge ncy services, mental health care, long-term care, preventative services, dental care, and substance abuse treatment (Alexandre, Saint-Jean, Crandall, & Fevrin, 2005; 2002; Brantle y et al., 2005; 2005; Coughlin, Long, & Kendall, 2002; 2004; Davin, eburger & & Andersen, 2002; 2001; Kenn & Wicks, 2002). However, few stud ies have applied the health behavioral model to study CAM use. Thus far, two st udies were identified applying Andersen's behavioral model as the conceptual model to study CAM use among patients (Fouladbakhsh, et al., 2005; Kelner & Wellman, 1997 a). The most recent study conducted by Fouladbakhsh and colleagues, sampled 9 68 cancer patients from Midwestern communities in the United States and the majority of whom were over 60 years old. The independent variables selected inclu ded gender, age, race, education, marital status (predisposing), income, health insur ance status, caregiver presence, geographic location (enabling), cancer stage and si te, symptoms, treatment and perceived health need (need). The study found that gender, ma rital status, cancer stage and treatment, and the number of severe symptoms experi enced were significant predictors of CAM use (2005). Kelner and Wellman (1997) used the health behavioral model to study five modes of treatment: family physicians, chiropr actors, acupuncturists/traditional Chinese doctors, naturopaths and Reiki practitioner s. The study included three hundred patients identified by contacting practitioners and from local listings in alternative directories in Toronto, Canada. Compared to subject s who consulted family physicians, users of four CAM therapies were more likely to be female, younger, highly educated, and have high incomes. It was also reported that mo re than 30% the CAM users and 62% of those who consulted CAM practitioners chose to u se CAM because of suggestions and recommendations by their family members, friends, a nd acquaintances, co-workers, and other CAM practitioners. The study also found that more than 75% of the patients using 28 CAM considered their health problems to be serious; the mean number of years CAM users had suffered with their primary health proble ms was higher than it was for the patients of family physicians. However, patients wh o used CAM were more likely to rate their physical and emotional health as good than di d the patients of family physicians. The small sample size in the above mentioned study prevented the report on the relative significance and importance of predisposing, enabli ng and need factors in determining CAM use. Moreover, the samples of the above two stu dies were limited to people with health problems and none of the studies included pe ople of racial and ethnic groups. Section 2. Behavioral Model of Vulnerable Populatio n Andersen's original health behavioral mode l has undergone several expansions, revisions, and updates over the years. Phase II of the model was developed in the 1970s to add a health services system component to the mo del and elaborate on the measurement of health services use (Aday & Andersen , 1974; Andersen & Newman, 1973). Phase III expanded the health service use co mponent to include health care practices and incorporate health outcomes as the ul timate goal (Andersen, 1995; Evans & Stoddart, 1990; Lalonde, 1975). A most recent expan sion was the development of Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Population (Gelberg , Andersen, & Leake, 2000). The motivation for developing the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Population (BMVP) was the observation that the conventional be havioral model had not adequately accounted for specific socio-structural characteris tics and challenges faced when obtaining needed health care services by certain po pulation groups, such as minorities, immigrants, children and adolescents, the mentally ill, the elderly, the chronically ill, and the poor and homeless (Aday, 1993; Gelberg, et al., 2000). BMVP adds vulnerable 29 domains to the traditional domains in Andersen's mo del. Vulnerable domains are also categorized by predisposing, enabling and need comp onents. Such a model is particularly helpful in assessing the influences of population-s pecific factors relative to conventional factors on the use of health care services. Studying use of medical care and health outcomes f or a community-based random sample of 363 homeless individuals, Gelberg and col leagues identified and categorized predisposing, enabling and need factors that were s pecific to the homeless population in addition to the conventional domains (Gelberg, et a l., 2000). The identified predisposing factors in the vulnerable domain included social st ructural characteristics, such as acculturation, immigration status and literacy; chi ldhood experiences (e.g. abuse and neglect history); residential history; living condi tions (e.g. lead paint and unsafe structures); criminal history and substance abuse. The enabling factors in the vulnerable domain included receipt of public benefits, having competing needs (for food, housing, medicine), community crime rate, and availability o f social services. The need factors (perceived and evaluated health) in the vulnerable domain are not different from those in the conventional domain. The study found that the n ewly added domains were important in understanding use of health services for homeles s people (Gelberg, et al., 2000). Though BMVP was initially applied to study homeless populations (Austin, Andersen, & Gelberg, 2008; Desai, Rosenheck, & Kasp row, 2003; 2002; Andersen , & Gelberg, 2007; Swanson, Andersen, & Gelberg, 2003), the model has also been subsequently used as a theoretical framework to study the use of cervical cancer scree ning among underserved Hispanic and African-American women (Bazargan, Bazargan, Farooq, & Baker, 2004), access to 30 vision care by low-income multiethnic population (B aker, Bazargan, of self-reported dep ression among Hispanic and Blacks (Bazargan et al., 2005). The findings of these stud ies support the importance of including domains specific to the population, further validat ing the model as a viable framework for the study of health service use among vulnerable po pulations. BMVP had not been applied to the study of CAM use a mong REI populations when this study was developed. As a result, REI dom ains were therefore added in the adapted BMVP. Figure 1 below depicts the adapted be havioral model with REI domains. 31 Figure 1 Adapted BMVP with REI Domains Predisposing Factors Enabling Factors Need Factors Age Gender Education Race/Ethnicity Attitude Activities Health Insurance Regular Source of Care Unmet Health Care Need Worry about Food Worry about Rent Receive Public Benefit Health Status Chronic Conditions Health Related Quality of Life Conventional Domains Racial, Ethnic and Immigration Domains Accultu- ration Access to Conventional Health Care Cultural Heritage Cultural Acceptance Racial Discrimination Cultural Barriers Income Language Place of Birth Years in U.S. CAM Use Self-rated Health Status Number of Physically Unhealthy Days Number of Mentally Unhealthy Days Number of Days with Functional Limitations Communication with providers Economic Distress Predisposing For the predisposing component, the conventional do main includes factors commonly identified as important determinants of CA M use in previous studies: age, gender, education, race and ethnicity (Berger, 1993 ; Eisenberg, et al., 1993; Fulder, 1988; Sharma, 1992; Thomas, Carr, Westlake, & Williams, 1 991; Wellman, 1995). The REI domain of the predisposing component includes indic ators of cultural heritage (importance and activities) and acculturation (lang uage, place of birth, years of residence in the US). Identification to cultural heritage is the extent t o which a person identifies with a particular culture. Those who identify highly with a particular culture are more likely to have a stake in that culture and are more likely to participate in activities of that culture (Ferguson, 1976; Oetting, Donnermeyer, et al., 1998 ). Cultural heritage is measured by two variables in this study: importance of cultural heritage and involvement with activities of cultural heritage. The importance of passing down one's cultural heritage and 32 participation in activities related to one's cultur e have been used as indicators of cultural identification in past research (Johnson, Wall, Gua nipa, et al., 1998). Identification to cultural heritage is also subject to change as i mmigration, resettlement, and integration into a different society take place. Acculturation refers to the process of acquiring the cultural traits of the host society to which one im migrates (Redfield, et al., 1936). Studies of acculturation use several proxies as indicators of the extent to which individuals adapt to the mainstream culture, such as length of reside nce in the United States: for example generation status, years of residence in the U.S., proportion of the respondent's life lived in the U.S., or age at arrival, parents' place of b irth, language use, customs, ethnic identity, etc. (Balcazar & Krull, Haffner, 1988; Dwyer, 1989). Individual's use of English or their native language has been used frequently and shown to be a robust indic ator of acculturation in many studies (Burnam, et Caetano, 1987; Cuellar, et a l., 1980; Delgado, Johnson, Trevino, 1990; Marks, et al., 1987; Mendoza, 1989; Padilla, 1980). Enabling The conventional domain for the enabling component includes income and access to conventional health care (health insurance, regu lar source of care, unmet health care need). The three factors have generally been studie d as indicators of access to conventional health care in the literature (Aday & Andersen, 1984; Bloom, Simpson, Cohen, & Parsons, 1997; Greenwald, et al., 2004; Ho well, 1988; Robertson & Cousineau, 33 1986; Rosenberg, Wise, Palmer, Horton, & Adams-Camp bell, 2005; Saver & Peterfreund, 1993; Simpson et al., 2005; Wood, Hayw ard, Corey, Freeman, & Shapiro, 1990). The REI domain for the enabling component in cludes economic distress, cultural barriers (perceived cultural acceptance and racial discrimination) and communication with providers. As discussed in the background section, the majorit y of CAM modalities are not covered by health insurance companies except for ch iropractic care (Cherkin, et al., 2002; Cleary-Guida, et al., 2001). Some private insurers cover acupuncture treatments with limitations (Weeks, 2001). Thus, CAM use means addi tional out-of-pocket cost for people with regular health insurance that does not cover CAM, but CAM is a less expensive health care option for people without reg ular health insurance. Similarly, CAM may serve as an alternative health care choice for people who lack a regular source of conventional health care. It has been documented th at people with lower income are also more likely to be uninsured, less likely to have re gular source of care, and more likely to have unmet health care needs (Bloom, et al., 1997; Guendelman, Wyn, & Tsai, 2000; Park & Buechner, 1997; Saver & Peterfreund, 1993). By including the above indicators, this study seeks to examine the independent impacts of access to conventional health care on CAM use. People of racial and ethnic groups and immigrants h ave been reported to be less likely to have health insurance and more likely to lack regular source of care (Baker, Stevens, & Brook, 1996; Brown, Wyn, & Ojeda, 1999; Carrasquillo, eck, & Wright, O'Malley, Mandelblatt, Gold, Cagney, & Kerner, 1997 ; Ojeda & Brown, 2005; Phillips, 1999; Shi & Stevens, 2005; Vitullo & Taylor, 2002). It has also been reported that people of a disadvantaged racial and ethnic populat ion who have greater financial difficulty were more likely to use CAM care (Bazarg an, Bazargan-Hejazi, & Baker, 2005). Furthermore, cultural barriers to conventional serv ices and attraction to CAM may figure prominently, especially when lack of acc eptance, prejudice, or discrimination leads individuals to feel that their cultural tradi tion or heritage is being judged or not understood within the conventional care delivery sy stem (Sung, 1999). This is true particularly for immigrants, regardless of social p osition or education. Cultural and language barriers can also be present in communicat ions with health providers from the host society 2005; Lamb & Smith, 2002; Lassetter & & Lau, & Zayas, 2001; Monroe & Shirazian, 2004; Risk 2004; 1992; Yeo, 2004). Although reasons other than cultural and language b arriers may account for discomfort or difficulties patients experience in raising issues with their health care provider, for people from REI groups, levels of discomfort with communic ation largely reflect language and 35 cultural barriers. Differing models of health and h ealth beliefs may lead to poor compliance with medical advice and treatment, unsat isfactory health outcomes and resorting to CAM therapies. Additionally perceived social unacceptability and discrimination have been noted as influencing socia l integration for REI groups (Chavez, 1994; Smart & Smart, 1995). Need Need factors include both self-perceived needs (per ceived health status) and evaluated needs (disease diagnoses) by health care professionals. Though the perceived and evaluated health care needs vary among racial a nd ethnic groups and certain health conditions have specific relevance to particular po pulation groups, the need factors are the same for those in the conventional domain as we ll as the REI domain. It has been indicated that the need for health care increases w hen one's health problems interfere with their daily physical, mental and social functi ons (Zola, 1973). Thus, health related quality of life (HRQoL) measures (self-rated health status, number of physically unhealthy days, number of mentally unhealthy days a nd number of days with functional limitations) are used together with chronic health conditions in the need component. 36 Section 3. A Working Model for CAM Use Figure 2 Operational Model for CAM Use Race/ Ethnicity Cultural Heritage Acculturation Access to Conventional Health Care CAM Use SA 2 SA 2 SA 3 Predisposing Factors Enabling Factors Need Factors SA 1 Figure 2 is a working model that delineates the key constructs and hypothesized causal relationships among the constructs as relate d to the three specific aims of this study. CAM use, on the far right, is the outcome in this study and has four arrows pointing to it. Though the nature of cross-sectiona l data of SHAPE only allows for identifying relationship between CAM use and other factors, inferences could be made regarding the influences of predisposing and enabli ng factors on CAM use based on the adapted BMVP described earlier. The arrows represen t the three specific aims (SA) - SA 1: Examine variation in CAM use among racial and et hnic populations; SA 2: Evaluate the extent to which cultural beliefs and acculturat ion are associated with variation in CAM use; SA 3: Assess the association of access to conventional health care and CAM use among REI populations. On the left side of Figu re 2 are three predisposing constructs: race/ethnicity, cultural heritage, and acculturation. Race/ethnicity is in the 37 conventional domain; cultural heritage and accultur ation belong to REI domain. The arrow pointing from race/ethnicity to cultural heri tage indicates that individuals' racial and ethnic background inevitably influences their i dentification with cultural heritage as reflected by the values and beliefs they place on t heir culture. Furthermore, members of the same race and ethnic group do not possess unifo rm levels of culture identification; values and beliefs vary among subcultures within th e same race and ethnic group (Oetting, Swaim, & Chiarella, 1998; Spector, 2004). In addition, individuals may experience and report different levels of cultural identification depending on the social context (Oetting, Swaim, et al., 1998). If individu als adapt to social context through immigration, their cultural identification may chan ge with the process of acculturation. Thus, the three left constructs in Figure 2 form a triangular relationship: culture and acculturation derive from race/ethnicity and accult uration influences cultural perspectives. In the mid-right of Figure 2 is the enabling constr uct: access to conventional health care. The arrow pointing from race and ethni city toward access to conventional health care indicates disparities of access to conv entional health services among racial and ethnic populations which has been documented by numerous research studies (Bazargan, et al., 2005; Broderick & Cassil, 2003; Underwood, et al., 2005). Need factors have been consistently found to influe nce CAM use positively based on previous studies (Astin, 1998; Sirois, 2002), an d thus are included as covariates of 38 analysis in this study. Likewise, age, gender and e ducation have been indicated by previous studies to have a more definite impact on CAM use and are thus included as covariates in the estimations and not shown in figu re 2. Financial stress has also been indicated to influence CAM use (Bazargan, et al., 2 005; Pagan & Pauly, 2005) and is also included as a covariate. 39 CHAPTER 3. METHOD Section 1. Data Source 3.1.1 Description of Data The proposed study used data collected in 2002 thro ugh the Survey of Health of Adults, the Population and the Environment (SHAPE ) . SHAPE was conducted among adults in Hennepin County, Minnesota (the most popu lous and diverse urban county in the state). Questions were asked about the mental a nd physical health status, chronic health conditions, access to care and health insura nce, use of preventative and conventional health services, health risk factors, cultural beliefs, community support, social connections, and economic, socio-demographic and environmental characteristics that influence health. The CAM practices asked abou t in SHAPE included whether the respondents had used acupuncture, herbal medicine, meditation and relaxation therapies or had seen a chiropractor or a traditional or spir itual healer in the previous 12 months. 3.1.2 Sampling Design Survey respondents were selected randomly through a two-stage process. In the first stage, a sample of 246,919 Hennepin County ho useholds with listed telephone numbers were obtained from Survey Sampling, Inc. (S SI). According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 99.2 percent of the Hennepin County househo lds had telephone services. The initial telephone list was augmented with an additi onal 8,113 telephone numbers to include student dormitories, apartments, and condom iniums missing from the original SSI sample. A random sample of households then was drawn from the augmented list. In fielding the study, all phone numbers for which the re was no answer were called a minimum of 20 times and the calls were spread out a cross daytime and evenings on both 40 weekdays and weekends. In many cases, 30 to 40 atte mpts were made and the highest number of attempts made was over 80. In the second stage of sampling, the adult that most recently celebrated a birthday in each sampled household was selected to participate in the survey. One of the goals of SHAPE sampling design was to ge nerate a sufficient number of respondents in each of the five racial and ethni c groups to allow for separate and specific reports for each group. The racial and eth nic groups were Blacks, Southeast Asian, American Indian, White, and Hispanic. Southe ast Asians were those who self- identified as Hmong, Laotian, Vietnamese, Cambodian , Thai, Malaysian, the Filipino, Burmese, or people from Singapore or Brunei (Landre man, Ding, Swaney, & Zimmerman, 2003). The number of completed interviews was 10,098. The survey was primarily conducted by telephone (n=9,920) with the exception of 178 supplemental in-person interviews which were conducted to increase the num ber of American Indians and African-born Blacks participating in the survey. Th e total response rate was 66.3 percent and the cooperation rate (the ratio of the number o f interviews to the number of respondents ever contacted) was 75.4 percent. The s urvey was translated and conducted in Spanish, Somali, Hmong, and Vietnamese for respo ndents who spoke those languages. After dropping those interviews with missing age da ta, the final sample was 9,959 with 2,794 respondents from racial and ethnic minorities and 1,007 interviews completed in languages other than English. 41 Section 2. Measures and Variables 3.2.1 Measures What follows is a description of the constructs an d variables used in the analysis. Constructs are broad categories (depicted as bold i n figure 2) and each of which consists at least two variables (listed as italics in figure 1) that measure the same construct. For the purpose of easier identification, the fonts of variables are italics and constructs are bold italics . Outcome CAM use was measured by five binary variables that ind icate whether the respondent had seen a chiropractor, a traditional o r spiritual healer, used herbal medicine or remedies, acupuncture or meditation or relaxatio n therapies respectively. A Multivariate Probit Model (MPV) was used to evaluat e the five binary outcome variables simultaneously (discussed in the next section). Predisposing Each respondent was identified as belonging to one of the five mutually exclusive racial and ethnic groups ( Race/Ethnicity ): Non-Hispanic White , Hispanic , Non-Hispanic African-American , Non-Hispanic Asians , and Non-Hispanic American Indians . The respondents were asked to identify their race/ethni city in four questions. The respondents were asked whether they were of Latino or Hispanic origin, which racial categories (White, African American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or other) with which they identified (they can choose more than one race), the race category (White, Afri can American or Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Both/All 42 Multiracial) with which they identified the most, a nd Southeast Asian subgroups. A final set of three race and ethnicity variables were comp uted based on the four questions including primary race, primary ethnicity, and prim ary race/ethnicity (mutually exclusive). The mutually exclusive Race/Ethnicity variable was used in this study. Other demographic variables include age , gender , and education . Cultural Heritage was measured by perceived Importance of Cultural Heritage and frequency attending Cultural Activities . SHAPE asked the respondents \"How often do you atten d activities that are part of your cultural heritage?\" and \"How important is it t o you to pass along your cultural heritage or the traditions of your ancestors to the next generation?\" The responses were coded from 1 (every week or more often) to 5 (less than a few times a year) on a five- point Likert scale for the first question and from 1 (very important) to 4 (unimportant) for the second question. The scores were then reversed and recoded so that higher scores indicate higher levels of cultural identification. Acculturation was measured by three variables: place of birth , number of years residing or living in the US, and language used during the interview (English or other language). Enabling Income was collected using three consecutive questions to minimize the number of missing values and reduce measurement error. Res pondents were asked to provide an actual amount of their household's income before ta x from all sources in the previous year. If the respondents failed to provide a respon se, they were asked to indicate whether their income fell between certain income categories based on 2001 federal poverty level 43 (FPL) for their household size. In addition, the re spondents were asked whether their income was below an amount that was equal to 200% F PL. The variable income was then created and categorized to five levels (below 200%, 200%-300%, 300%-400%, 400%- 600%, above 600% of FPL). Information regarding whe ther the individual had received any public assistance (Subsidized or sliding fee ch ild are, SSI- disability benefits, home health care services, assistance with heating or en ergy bills, monthly welfare payments such as Aid to Family with Dependent Children (AFDC ), General Assistance (GA), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Min nesota Family Investment Program (MFIP), Low income housing assistance, publ ic housing, WIC, Food stamps, Food from food shelves, Free or reduced price schoo l lunches) was also used to categorize those with missing values and whose inco me was below 200% poverty level. Information about Access to Conventional Health Care includes three variables; Health Insurance , Regular Source of Care , and Unmet Health Care Need . These measures were identified as enabling factors in the health behavior model (Andersen, 1995; Andersen & Newman, 1973; Gelberg, et al., 200 0) and commonly used as indicators for health care access (Ayanian, et al., 2000; Berk & Schur, 1998a; Blendon, et al., 1989; US Department of Health and Human Servic es, 2003). Two questions were asked to measure health insurance coverage: \"Do you have any kind of health care coverage, including health insurance, prepaid plans such as HMO or government plan such as Medicare, Medicaid, MA (Medical Assistance) , GMAC (General Assistance Medical Care), MNCare (Minnesota Care) or PMAP (Pre paid Medical Assistance Plan)? and \"Is your health insurance from Medicaid, MA, GA MC, MNCare, or PMAP?\" A 44 categorical variable indicating private, public or no health insurance was then created based on these two questions. Regular Source of Care was measured by a categoric al variable. Doctor's office or clinic was chosen as the reference group and oth er categories include 1) a public health clinic or community health center; 2) a hospital ou tpatient department, a hospital emergency room or an urgent care center; 3) other p lace or no usual place. Individuals were also asked whether they delayed care or did no t receive needed health care and the reasons for delayed or did not receive health care (lack of insurance, because of cost, could not get an appointment, don't like, trust, or believe in doctors, didn't know where to go, didn't think they could find help that would be respectful of their culture, no interpreter services, family responsibilities preve nted, transportation problems, didn't think it would help). Thus, Unmet Health Care Need was created as a categorical variable with ten categories representing the above reasons. A description of the creation of this variable is included in Table 1. Separate measures asking about access to CAM were not included in the questionnaire due to the fact that most insurance c ompanies did not routinely cover CAM therapies, except for chiropractic. None of the pub lic insurance programs covered acupuncture and neither public nor private insurers covered meditation and relaxation therapies, herbal medicine, or visits to traditiona l healers (BCBSMN, 2005; CMS, 2005; First Plan of Minnesota, 2005; Health Partners, 200 5; MEDICA, 2005; Preferred One, 2005). Relaxation therapies and herbal products wer e readily available on the internet, community centers, and local grocery stores. CAM pr actitioners and products were dispersed throughout Hennepin so that we assumed re latively equal geographic access to 45 CAM services. Health insurance (private, public and no insurance) was included in the analyses (discussed later) as an indicator of acces s to both conventional health care and chiropractic care. As discussed earlier, lack of in surance may influence the use of CAM. In the enabling REI domain, the construct of Economic Distress was measured by three questions. The first question was: \"In the pa st 12 months, how often did you worry that your food would run out before you had money t o buy more?\" (1-often, 2- sometimes, 3-rarely, 4-never). This ordered variabl e was then reverse coded so that higher number indicated higher degree of economic d istress. The second question asked: \"In the past 12 months, did you miss a rent or mort gage payment because you didn't have enough money?\" If the answer was \"yes\", the binary variable was coded as \"1\" and \"0\" if \"no\". Finally, respondents were asked whether they received any of ten public services in the past 12 months including subsidized or sliding fee child care, SSI or disability benefits, home health care services, assistance wit h heating or energy bills, monthly welfare payments such as AFDC, GA, MFIP, low income housing assistance, WIC, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, I nfants, and Children, food stamps, food from food shelves, free or reduced price schoo l lunches. It was coded as \"1\" if the respondent received any one of the above benefits a nd \"0\" otherwise. Cultural Barriers include two measures: Cultural Acceptance and perceived Racial Discrimination . Cultural Acceptance was measured by a five-point Likert scale in response to the question \"How often are you in situ ations that make your feel unaccepted because of your culture?\" and reversed so that high er scores represented a lower level of acceptance. Racial Discrimination was measured by whether the respondent experienced discrimination because of their race, color, ethnic ity, or country of origin. 46 The measure of Communication with health care providers was based on the answer to the question \"How often do you feel comfo rtable asking questions or raising issues with your health care provider?\"(1-always, 2 -usually, 3-sometimes, 4-never). Measurement error might occur if the respondent int erpreted the question to include CAM providers. However, because this question follo wed a question about conventional source of health care, it was assumed that the resp ondent regarded the health care providers in the question as conventional health ca re providers. Need Two constructs were used for assessing individuals ' health condition and perceived physical and mental health: a categorical variable indicating whether the person had been diagnosed of any of the ten Chronic Conditions , and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) including Self-rated Health Status , Number of Physically Unhealthy Days in the prior month, Number of Mentally Unhealthy Days in the prior month, and Number of Activity Limitation Days in the prior month because of poor physical or mental health. Previous studies have in dicated that CAM users were more likely to have chronic medical conditions, but did not always report poorer health status (Berger, 1993; Blais, Sharma, 1992; Wellman, 1995) . It has been indicated that the need for health care increases when one's health pr oblems interfere with daily physical, mental and social functions (Zola, 1973). Thus, bes ides the conventional measure of health status and chronic conditions, perceptions o f HRQoL were also included in the need component in the model. Unhealthy Days is a si mple and comprehensive measure 47 that has been identified as a valid and responsive indicator of perceived physical and mental health over time (Newschaffer, 1998). 48 3.2.2 Variables Table 1 Description of Variables Variable Q# Question Asked in the Questionnaire Not e CAM use CAM [Multi-binary: chiropractor (0/1) healer (0/1) herbal (0/1) acupuncture (0/1) meditation (0/1)] q30 30.

Hypotheses and Analysis Plan The three specific aims, their respective hypothes es and rationales are described followed by the analysis plan for these three aims. Because the three specific aims can not be distinctively separated from each other, an overall description of a three-step analysis plan is described after laying out the hyp otheses. In order to analyze the SHAPE data, appropriate st atistical software that is able to take consideration of the sampling features, such a s clustering, stratification and unequal probability sampling design to generate accurate es timates and standard errors is necessary. Thus, STATA is used for the analyses of this study. The geographic weight was applied in the analysis based on the whole samp le and race/ethnicity weight was used in the racial and ethnic specific analysis. Hypotheses Specific Aim 1 (SA 1): Examine variation in CAM use among racial and ethnic populations The first specific aim describes the prevalence, p atterns and variations of the use of each of the five CAM therapies in the general po pulation and racial and ethnic populations. Two hypotheses for this specific aim a re: Hypothesis 1a. The degree to which race and ethnici ty is associated with CAM use varies for different modalities; Hypothesis 1b. The degree to which race and ethnici ty is associated with CAM use is congruent with the racial and ethnic origin of CAM modalities. To be more specific, compared with other racial and ethnic groups, white s are hypothesized to be more likely to use chiropractic care, Asians are more likely to use acupuncture, Non-whites are more 58 likely to see a traditional healer, and all racial and ethnic groups are equally likely to use herbal medicine and meditation and relaxation thera pies. Hypothesis 1a and 1b follow from earlier discussio ns of cultural heritage theory (Spector, 2004) which posits that people tend to en gage in health practices which are consistent with the racial or ethnic culture with w hich they identify. Hypothesis 1a and 1b test whether there are significant variations in th e use of five CAM modalities among each of the five racial and ethnic groups and the U S-born versus non-US-born populations. Specific Aim 2 (SA 2): Evaluate the extent to which cultural identity and acculturation are associated with variation in CAM use The second specific aim investigates how two predi sposing constructs (Cultural Heritage and Acculturation) from the REI domain dep icted in Figure 2 relates to CAM use. It evaluates whether the predisposing componen t of the REI domain is a significant supplement to race and ethnicity from the conventio nal domain. Two hypotheses are tested for SA 2: Hypothesis 2a. The more individuals identify with t heir own culture, the more likely they are to use CAM therapies associated with their cult ure; Hypothesis 2b. The less acculturated individuals ar e, the more likely they are to use CAM therapies associated with their culture. The theoretical underpinnings of these hypotheses are that the more people are committed and adhere to or are \"pulled\" by their cu lture heritage, the more likely they are 59 to use CAM from their culture; the less people iden tify with or feel integrated into the \"mainstream\" culture, the more likely they are to u se the CAM of their cultural origin. Specific Aim 3 (SA 3): Assess the association of ac cess to conventional health care and CAM use among REI populations. Hypothesis 3a. Individuals without health insurance are more likely to use CAM; Hypothesis 3b. Individuals without regular source o f care are more likely to use CAM; Hypothesis 3c. Individuals whose needed health care is delayed are more likely to use CAM; Hypotheses 3a, 3b and 3c are based on the discussi on earlier that CAM may provide a low-cost alternative for those who do not have adequate access to conventional health care. Analysis Plan To test the hypotheses of the above three specific aims, a three-step analysis plan is as follows. First, a univariate logistic regress ion will be performed to examine the influencing factors on the use of each of the CAM t herapies based on the whole population sample. The specific equation is: logit [E [d klmqrnupv | klm qrnu pv]] = + k Demographics k + l Cultural Heritage l +m Acculturation m + \u00b5\u00b5 \u00b5\u00b5q income q + r Access to Conventional Health Care 60 r + n Economic Distress n + u Cultural Barriers u + p Communication p v x Need v (3.1) Where Demographics includes Race/Ethnicity , Age , Gender , and Education . In order to avoid forcing a linear relationship on the relationship between race and ethnicity and CAM use, Race/Ethnicity will be recoded as five separate indicator variabl es and White will be used as the reference group. The othe r variables and constructs have been described earlier. k, l, m, q, r, n, u, p and v are index indicators for the respective variables or constructs: Demographics , Cultural Heritage , Acculturation , Income , Access to Conventional Health Care , Economic Distress , Cultural Barriers , and Communication with health care providers. E [d klm qrnu pv | klm qrnu pv] represents the probability that a respondent who belongs to the re spective category group uses CAM and k, l, m, \u00b5q, r, n, u, p, v, lm, mu are respective coefficients. The last two terms in 3.1 represent the interaction effects as shown in F igure 2. Second, racial/ethnic- and immigrant- specific log it analyses for each of the five CAM therapies will be conducted to examine the spec ific aims by race/ethnicity and birth place while controlling the interactions between ra ce/ethnicity and immigration status and other predisposing and enabling factors as depicted in figure 2. Thirdly, a multivariate probit model (MPV) will be used to examine the three specific aims in more depth. MPV is chosen for the following reasons: 1) An individual could use any or all of the five CAM therapies; 2) The use of these CAM therapies may not be independent events from each other and need to be estimated jointly; 3) MPV enables the estimation of marginal and unconditiona l probabilities of the use of these five 61 CAM therapies and reveals response pattern probabil ities for the influence of cultural heritage, acculturation and access to conventional health care on CAM; 4) Analyses of more than three binary outcomes with correlated err ors have been computationally difficult and time-consuming until recent years (Go urieroux & Monfont, 1996; Hajivassiliou & Ruud, 1994). The mvprobit in STATA developed by Cappellari and Jenkins allows for obtaining consistent and asympto tically efficient estimators (Cappellari & Jenkiins, 2003). The general specific ation of the MVP is a five-equation model: CAM i = Bb i + + (3.2) Where CAM i represents five binary responses of CAM use by subj ect i. bi represents the vector of covariates as included in 3.1 and B is a 4 x m (m is the number of included covariates) matrix of coefficients of regr ession of CAM on b. The n vector contains values of underlying factors (i.e. latent variables) that account for correlation among the five binary outcome variables ( CAM i) through the 4 x n matrix of factor coefficients. is five-vectors of uncorrelated residuals. The lik elihood ratio Chi-square test will be used to test the goodness-of-fit of th is model. 62 CHAPTER 4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This chapter presents the findings of the analyses based on the total population and racial/ethnic and immigration (REI) populations respectively. Section I describes the characteristics of the sample providing descriptive statistics for all key independent variables. Section II, III and IV discuss results r elated to each of the three specific aims. Section 1. Description of the Sample Tables 2-6 describe the characteristics of the samp le population including the total number of observations according to predisposing, e nabling and need factors. The percentages are weighted to account for the complex survey design. Geographic weights are used for the analysis for the total and immigra nt population and racial/ethnic weights for the racial/ethnic- specific analysis. Table 2 shows the demographics of the sample popula tion in the total and racial and ethnic populations which reflect the distributi on of race-ethnicity, age, gender, and education of the population in Hennepin County. Rac ial and ethnic minority populations consist of higher percentage of those who are betwe en the age of 18 and 34 than the total population (33.4%), particularly in Hispanics (64.8 %) and Asian (58.1%). About 58.2% of Hispanics and 40.4% of American Indi ans are male, while the percentage of males in the total population is 48.4 %. The education levels among Hispanics and American Indians are considerably low er -- the percentage of those with a high school education or lower among Hispanics (59. 8%) and Americans Indians (55.2%) is more than double that of the total popul ation (26.1%). Table 3 displays the predisposing factors in the ra cial and ethnic domain depicted in the adapted BMVP model: cultural identity and ac culturation. While over 95% of 63 Whites and American Indians are born in the United States, 91.5% of Asians, nearly 60% of Hispanics and about 20% of Blacks were born in a nother country. Among people in the total population who were forei gn-born, about 44% had lived in the United States for less than ten years. Among people in racial and ethnic populations, about three-quarters of Hispanics and 70% of Blacks had lived in the United States for less than ten years, whereas three-quart ers of Asians were longer-term residents who lived in the U.S. for ten years or more. In ter ms of language skills, nearly half of Hispanics (45.4%) and Asians (48.3%) completed the interview in a language other than English. When asked how important it is to pass along cultur al heritage or tradition of their ancestors to the next generation, 38.2% of people i n the total population considered it very important, while two-thirds or more of Hispani cs (63.7%), Blacks (77.6%), American Indians (68.1%), and Asians (70.9%) report ed this was very important. Nearly half of the people in the total population (47.8%) attended activities that are part of their cultural heritage less than a few times a year, but the percentages with infrequent attendance at cultural events among Hispanics (26.7 %), Black (25.3%), American Indian (17.5%), and Asian (20.5%) are much lower. Enabling factors including income, access to health care, economic distress, and cultural barriers are shown in Tables 4 and 5. Whil e less than twenty percent (17.5%) of the people in the total population had household in come equal to or less than twice the federal poverty level (FPL), nearly 60% of Hispanic s and more than 40% of Blacks, American Indians, and Asians were in the lowest inc ome category. 64 Although the full-year uninsurance rate among White s, Blacks and Asians was less than 6%, over one quarter of Hispanics and nea rly 20% of American Indians were uninsured during the entire year in 2002. Including those who were insured only part of the year, the proportion of the population not insu red the entire year totaled nearly 50% of Hispanics, almost a third (31.1%) of American In dians and about one quarter of Blacks. When asked about having a regular source of care, a bout 15% of Hispanics (14.8%) and Blacks (16.4%) reported going to a hosp ital emergency room or urgent care center as their usual source of care, whereas less than 8% of Whites, American Indians, and Asians reported these resources. About 13.7% of Hispanics reported having no regular source of care compared to less than 3% of the people in other racial and ethnic populations. The percentages who report they delaye d medical care among Hispanics (14.3%) and American Indians (18.1%) are also highe r than reported for the total population (9.4%). The distribution of enabling factors in the racial/ ethnic domain of the BMVP model, or in this case, economic distress profiles shown in Table 5 are consistent with the income measure in Table 4. Approximately 10% of His panics (8.0%), Blacks (12.2%), and American Indians (9.3%) had missed rent or mort gage payment in the previous year because of lack of money. Concerns about running ou t of food were more common, among Hispanic, Black, American Indian and Asians t han is true of the total population. About one third of Hispanics and Asians, over 40% o f Blacks (42.6%) and over half of American Indians (56%) had received one or more pub lic benefits including subsidized or sliding fee child care, home health care service s, assistance with heating or energy 65 bills, monthly welfare payment, low income housing assistance, WIC, food stamps, food from food shelves, and free or reduced price school lunches. Subjects were asked how often they were in situatio ns that made them feel unaccepted because of their culture. Approximately 25% of people in the total population felt unaccepted a few times a year or more, while m ore than half of Hispanics (57.9%), Blacks (68.9%), American Indians (51.8%) and Asians (51.5%) reported the same. When asked about whether they felt that they were d iscriminated against while getting medical care during the 12 months because o f their race, color, ethnicity, or county of origin, compared to less than 10% of the total population, approximately one- quarter of Hispanics (24.6%) and Asians (26.7%), ab out a third of American Indians (31.1%), and over forty percent of Blacks (42.7%) a nswered yes. There is little difference in the level of comfort reported in talking with pr oviders across the racial and ethnic population. Approximately 80% of the total populat ion and each racial and ethnic population always or usually felt comfortable askin g questions or raising issues with their health care providers. Table 6 shows characteristics of the population in terms of need or health related factors. About one-quarter of Hispanics and nearly 30% of American Indians report their health to be fair or poor, while less than 10% of t he total population report fair or poor health. In terms of having chronic conditions, comp ared to the total population, higher percentage of American Indians reported asthma, dia betes, low back pain, depression and anxiety, while lower percentages of Asians reported these chronic conditions, though the difference may not be statistically significant. Ov er the 30 days prior to the interview, the average number of days of poor physical health, men tal health, and limited functional 66 activities is higher among American Indians and Bla cks and somewhat lower among Asians than is true for the total population. 67 Table 2 Characteristics of the Population - Predisposing Fa ctors in Conventional Domain Total N a%bTotal N N 244 26.1% 26 37.0% Total Population White Hispanic Black AI cAsian Total Na - Actual total number of observations; % b - Weighted column percentages (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding). 68 Table 3 Characteristics of the Population - Predisposing F actors in Racial/Ethnic Domain Total N a%bTotal N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Birth place 8178 100.0% 7041 45.4% 287 5.8% 5 1.2% 334 Cultural Unimportant 10.3% 11.8% 26 2.6% 30 3.3% 5 0.9% 28 26.7% 331 25.3% times year 30.0% 29.0% 237 35.5% 347 31.4% 81 50.4% 188 35.9% Total Population White Hispanic Black American Indian As ian Total Na - Actual total number of observations; % b - Weighted column percentages (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding) 69 Table 4 Characteristics of the Population - Enabling Facto rs in the Conventional Domain Total N a%bTotal N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Income level based on FPL <= 200% 2866 17.5% 13.3% 16 11.4% Had entire 8397 6558 350 5 4.1% 791 insurance part 1040 465 144 19.8% 3 43 19.6% 9.5% insurance entire year 503 219 152 26.1% 8 2 5.8% 22 14.9% 142 16. 3% 20 6.7% 45 5.6% No usual place 308 2.6% 2.2% 78 13.7% 42 2.5% 7 11.9% 34 18.1% 51 8.6% Total Population White Hispanic Black American Indian As ian Total Na - Actual total number of observations; % b - Weighted column percentages (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding) 70 Table 5 Characteristics of the Population - Enabling Facto rs in the Racial/Ethnic Domain Total N a%bTotal N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Missed rent/mortgage payment No 8.0% 166 12.2% 32 9.3% 8.6% 94 6.8% Perceived unacceptance of 42.1% 427 31.1% times year 14.1% 11.6% 184 26.4% 272 28.1% 52 27.8% 154 27.0% Once or twice a month 787 5.2% 348 2.7% 87 17.5% 174 17.3% 34 11.6% 143 Almost week 1.5% 0.9% 23 3.3% 96 6.1% 11 3.6% 10.7% 42.7% 3.1% 27 1.4% 8 6.3% 28 2.7% Total Population White Hispanic Black American Indian As ian Total Na - Actual total number of observations; % b - Weighted column percentages (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding) 71 Table 6 Characteristics of the Population - Need Factors Total N a%bTotal N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Health status Excellent 2147 26.6% 1658 27.4% 98 17.6% 259 18 1.6% 46 7.7% Mean S.E Mean S.E Mean S.E Days of poor physical health 2.50 0.11 2.46 0.12 2.38 0.26 3.12 0.35 6.35 2.42 1.38 0.17 during the past 30 days Days of poor mental health 2.11 0.09 1.98 0.10 2.53 0.41 3.03 0.39 4.78 1.54 2.14 0.34 during the past 30 days Days of limited functional activity 2.50 0.11 2.46 0.12 2.38 0.26 3.12 0.35 6.35 2.42 1.38 0.17 during the past 30 days Total Population White Hispanic Black American Indian As ian Total Na - Actual total number of observations; % b - Weighted column percentages (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding) 72 Section 2. Variation in CAM Use 4.2.1 Variations in CAM Use Among the Total and Rac ial/Ethnic Populations This section presents results related to Specific Aim 1 which examines variation in CAM use among the total and racial/ethnic popula tions. Briefly, the analyses examine differences in the prevalence of any CAM therapy us e and use of specific CAM modalities for the total population and each R/E po pulation. In Table 7, within the total population, 42.4% used one of the five CAM therapies. The prevalence rates reported for the us e of self-administered therapies (herbal medicine and meditation) are higher than that for t he use of provider-administered therapies (chiropractic, acupuncture, and tradition al healing), of which acupuncture is used least frequently (3.8%). The prevalence rates of the use of any CAM and herb al medicine vary somewhat across the five racial and ethnic populations, rang ing from nearly 40% among Hispanics to just over 50% among American Indians for the use of any CAM, and from about 20% among Blacks to 27.1% among Asians for the use of h erbal medicine. The prevalence rate for the use of provider-administered CAM varie s across different racial and ethnic populations, ranging from 14.4% among Whites to 4.1 % among American Indians for the use of chiropractic care; from 8.5% of Asians and 2 .0% of American Indians reporting use of acupuncture; from almost 18% of American Ind ians to 3.5% of Whites reporting traditional or spiritual healing. In order to determine whether use of any and specif ic CAM varies significantly across racial and ethnic populations, multiple logi stic regressions were performed. Table 8 provides a summary of the comparisons that only d isplays significant results. The first 73 column lists the race and ethnicity (not in parenth esis) with the highest prevalence rate of any CAM use or specific CAM modalities listed in th eir respective rows. Each of the second, third, fourth and fifth columns lists in de scending order the race/ethnicity with the next highest prevalence rate. For example, as p resented in Table 7, American Indians had the highest rate of any CAM use, followed by As ians, Whites, Blacks and Hispanics. Therefore, the racial and ethnic groups are present ed in this order in the first row of Table 8. The race and ethnicity in parenthesis is the refere nce group for the comparison of between group differences in CAM use. Also listed i n each column are the odds ratio and standard error from multiple logistic regressions f or each paired comparison controlling for predisposing and enabling factors as shown in f ootnote. For example, the odds of using any CAM services was significantly higher amo ng Whites than Blacks (OR=1.8) and Hispanics (OR=1.7) even after holding constant various factors associated with CAM use. As shown, CAM use varies by race/ethnicity and moda lities. In addition to Whites being more likely than Blacks and Hispanics to use any CAM, Asians were significantly more likely than Hispanics (OR=2.1) and Blacks (OR= 2.1) to use herbal medicine and Whites were more likely than Blacks (OR=1.7) to use herbal medicine. The odds of using meditation and relaxation therapies for Whites was about twice that of Hispanics (OR=1.9) and Asians (OR=2.1). For the three provider-administered CAM, although A merican Indians were significantly less likely than Whites (OR=5.4), Asi ans (OR=5.8), Hispanics (OR=5.1), and Blacks (OR=3.0) to use chiropractic, they were significantly more likely than Whites 74 (OR=2.3) and Hispanics (OR=3.2) to report seeing a spiritual or traditional healer. Furthermore, Asians were significantly more likely than any other racial and ethnic populations to have used acupuncture and more likel y than Whites (OR=3.2), Hispanics (OR=4.4) and Blacks (OR=3.6) to have seen a traditi onal or spiritual healer. 4.2.2 Inter-correlations between the Use of CAM The rapies Tables 9-14 display correlation coefficients with s tandard errors of the use of five CAM therapies. The results indicate that correlatio ns exist for the use of CAM and the strength of these correlations vary by modalities a nd race/ethnicity. In the total population, moderate correlations exist between pai rs of herbal medicine, meditation and relaxation therapy, acupuncture, and traditional or spiritual healer and the correlations between chiropractic and other CAM are relatively w eak. The associations between certain CAM therapies in some specific racial and e thnic populations are particularly strong. As shown in Tables 13 and 14, herbal medici ne and traditional or spiritual healer has a correlation coefficient of 0.898 in American Indians and the correlation coefficients between pairs of herbal medicine, acupuncture, and traditional healer are above 0.7 in Asians. Table 15 shows the covariance matrix of the error-terms. All of the error-term covariance are significant at p=0.001 level indicat ing the unexplained components in the choice of CAM use in each equation are positively c orrelated. 75 Table 7 Prevalence of the Use of CAM among the Total and R /E Populations N a%b N % N % N % N % N % Any CAM 4593 42.4% 33 5.5% 62 7.8% 41 17.9% 106 11.5% Asian Total Population White Hispanic Black American Indian Na - Actual number of observations; % b - Column percentages adjusted for sampling design (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding) 76 Table 8 Comparison of the Use of CAM among Racial and Ethni c Populations Prevalence rank Indian b Asian White Black Hispanic (Hispanic) 1.7*(0.4) (Black) 1.8** (0.3) Prevalence rank Asian Indian b White Hispanic Black (Hispanic) 2.1*(0.6) (Black) 1.7** (0.3) (Black) 2.1**(0.6) Prevalence rank Indian b Black White Hispanic Asian (Hispanic) 1.9*(0.5) (Asian) 2.1*(0.7) Prevalence rank White Asian Hispanic Black Indian b (Black) 1.8**(0.4) (Indian b) 5.8**(3.0) (Indian b)5.1**(2.7) (Indian b) 3.0*(1.5) (Indian b) 5.4***(2.5) Prevalence rank Asian Hispanic Black White Indian b (Hispanic) 3.8*(2.0) (Indian b) 5.2*(3.7) (Indian b) 3.4*(1.9) (Indian b)4.7**(2.6) (White) 4.2**(2.0) (Black) 5.9**(3.0) (Indian b)19.8***(13.7) Prevalence rank Indian bAsian Black Hispanic White (White) 2.3* (1.0) (White) 3.2***(1.1) (Hispanic) 3.2* (1.7) (Hispanic) 4.4***(1.7) (Black) OR(SE) OR(SE) a OR(SE) a OR(SE) a OR(SE) a OR (SE) a - Odds Ratio (Standard Error) of the CAM use with the racial/ethnic group in parenthesis as reference based on multiple logistic regression controlling for the following: predisposing factors- age, gender, e ducation, marrital status, friend, worship, communi ty, heritage, activity, birth place, years in US, i nterview language; enabling factors - income, health insuran ce, regular source of care, delayed medical care, e conomic distress, cultural barriers; need factors - HRQoL.

Results based on the total population are followed by results from REI populations. Results from both the univariate logistic and multi variate probit analysis (MVP) are presented 1. As stated in chapter 3, univariate logistic analy ses are used to provide evidence of associations between CAM use and degree s to which individuals adhere to cultural heritage and levels of acculturation. MVP offer more in-depth analyses to verify whether significant findings from univariate analys es remain as significant when inter- correlation of the use of the five CAM is taken int o consideration simultaneously. Analyses of more than three binary outcomes with co rrelated errors have been computationally difficult and time-consuming until recent years (Gourieroux & Monfont, 1996; Hajivassiliou & Ruud, 1994). The mvprobit in STATA developed by Cappellari and Jenkins allows for obtaining consistent and asy mptotically efficient estimators (Cappellari & Jenkiins, 2003). However, MVP generat es coefficients rather than odds ratios and it does not provide combined estimates f rom multiple imputation, thus MVP does not allow for direct comparison to the results of univariate analyses. The availability of analysis programs with capabilities of performin g the needed analyses will allow for more direct comparison of results in the future. 1 Control for predisposing factors: age, gender, education, marri tal status, friend, worship, community, heritage, activity, birth place, years in US, inter view language; enabling factors: income, health ins urance, regular source of care, delayed medical care, econo mic distress, cultural barriers; and need factors: HRQoL. 81 4.3.1 Results Based on the Total Population Table 16 shows the associations between two indicat ors of cultural heritage and the use of CAM based on the total population. The r esults indicate that the frequency of attending cultural activities is a stronger predict or for CAM use than the perceived importance of passing one's cultural heritage along to the next generation. Though both measures are significantly related to the use of an y CAM, keeping alive one's cultural heritage is only related to the use of herbal medic ine, while attending cultural activities is also found to be strongly associated with the use o f meditation and relaxation therapies and traditional or spiritual healing. In terms of the relations between CAM use and lengt h of US residence, the results from Table 17 show that the longer one stays in the US, the more likely one would use any CAM, meditation, and traditional healing. Langu age in which interview was conducted is not a significant predictor of CAM use . This is not surprising given only 5.2% of the total population did not complete the s urvey in English (Table 3). 82 Table 16 Association of Cultural Heritage with the Use of C AM in the Total Population Cultural heritage Total N a%bTotal N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Not very important 11975 36.8% 1975 17.8% 1975 19.7% 1975 13.9% cSE dOR SE OR SE OR SE OR SE 1.14* 0.07* 1.17* 0.08* 1.12 0.03 1.06 0.09 1.04 6 MVP Coef eSE 0.04 0.04 0.05 0.03 0.05 0.11 0.06 Cultural activities Total N a%bTotal N a%bTotal N a%bTotal N a%bTotal N a%bTotal N a%b Less 1.14** 0.05** Acupuncture Healer Any CAM Self-administered Provider-administered Medicine Adjusted Wald test: F( H osmer-Lemeshow goodness Area under the ROC curve=0.7064, n=9940 Total Na - Actual total number of observations; % b - Adjusted column percentages (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding); OR c, SE d- Odds Ratio, Standard Error from multiple logistic regression an alysis; Coef e, SE f - Coefficient, Standard Error from multivariate pro bit analysis; *p<0.05 **p<0.01 ***p<0.001; 1 - somewhat unimportant or unimportant 83 Table 17 Association of Acculturation to the Use of CAM in the Total Population Total N a%bTotal N a%bTotal N 320 11.9% 6.1% 504 504 7.2%** 2.6% 470 470 cSE dOR cSE d 1.12 0.24 1.02 0.27 1.04 0.32 1.55 0.59 1.97 1.44 1.24 0.34 eSE -0.001 0.14 -0.13 0.16 0.19 0.15 0.31 0.29 0.12 0.12 Any CAM Self-administered Provider-administered Herbal Medicine Meditation Chiropractic Acupuncture Hea ler Total Na - Actual total number of observations; % b - Adjusted column percentages (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding); OR c, SE d- Odds Ratio, Standard Error from multiple logistic regression an alysis; Coef e, SE f - Coefficient, Standard Error pro bit analysis; *p<0.05 **p<0.01 ***p<0.001 84 4.3.2 Results Based on REI populations Results of racial and ethnic specific analysis are shown in Tables 18-23. As discussed earlier, racial and ethnic specific analy sis intends to discover whether the association between cultural identity (i.e., passin g down one's cultural heritage and attending cultural activities) and CAM use varies b y race and ethnicity. As shown, the positive associations between cultural identity and the use of any CAM, self-administered CAM, or traditional healing shown in Table 16 were also found among Whites. However, no significant associations were found for the use of CAM therapies in other racial and ethnic populations with one exception: t he frequency of attending cultural activities was significantly associated with the us e of traditional healing among Blacks, American Indians and Asians (Table 23). Contrary to expectation, Asians who attended culturally related activities more frequently were less likely to use herbal medicine (Table 19). Tables 24 and 25 reveal the differences in the impa ct of cultural identity on the use of CAM between the US-born and non-US-born. For the use of self-administered CAM, attitudes towards one's cultural heritage was significantly related to the use of any CAM and herbal medicine among the immigrants, but n ot among those born in the US. Among the native-born, the frequency of attending c ultural activities was positively associated with the use of any CAM, herbal medicine and meditation/relaxation therapies. For the use of provider-administered CAM, acupunctu re use was positively associated with the perceived importance of passing along cultural heritage among immigrants. And the frequency of attending cultural activities was positively related to 85 the use of chiropractic among the foreign-born and positively related to the use of spiritual/traditional healing among the native-born . In conclusion, in the total population, positive associations were found between CAM use and the extent to which people hold to thei r culture heritage, but not levels of acculturation.

Association between Access to Convention al Health Care and the Use of CAM Section IV presents results from analyses evaluatin g the association of CAM use and conventional enabling factors shown in BMVP (Fi gure 1). Particularly, as related to Specific Aim 3, this section examines the associati on between access to conventional health care and the use of CAM among racial, ethnic and immigrant populations. 4.4.1 Results Based on the Total Population Based on the total population (Table 26), those wit hout health insurance coverage part of the year are more likely than those insured the entire year to use herbal medicine (OR=1.68) and meditation (OR=1.47). Compared to the full-year insured, those who are uninsured the entire year are more likely to use an y CAM (OR=1.7), herbal medicine (OR=2.37), meditation (OR=2.11), acupuncture (OR=3. 8) and traditional or spiritual healer (OR=3.41). As shown, compared with the part- year uninsured, those uninsured the entire year are more likely to use CAM and the like lihood of CAM use is higher. The grouping of regular source of care into four ca tegories in Table 27 is similar to that used in National Ambulatory Medical Care Su rvey (Cherry et al., 2008; Hing et al., 2008). Those with no usual source of care were twice as likely to use any CAM, herbal medicine and chiropractic as those who repor t their usual source of care is a doctor's office or clinic. Compared with people who usually go to a doctor's office when needing medical care, those who usually go to a pub lic/community health center, a hospital outpatient department, or other place for care are at increased odds of using of herbal medicine (OR=1.68), chiropractic (OR=1.83), acupuncture (OR=2.57), and 95 spiritual healing (OR=1.60). Delayed medical care w as moderately associated with the use of herbal medicine. However, using an emergency room or urgent care center as a regular source of care was not significantly associ ated with CAM use. 96 Table 26 Association between Health Insurance Coverage and the Use of CAM in the Total Population Total N a%bTotal N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Had insurance entire year OR SE OR SE OR SE OR cSE 1.40 0.25 1.68** 0.30** 0.12 Logit(no insurance) OR cSE dOR SE OR SE OR SE CAM Self-administered Provider-administered Herbal Medicine Meditation Chiropractic Acupuncture Hea ler Total Na - Actual total number of observations; % b - Column percentages (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding); OR c, SE d- Odds Ratio, Standard Error from multiple logistic regression analysis; Coef e, SE f - Coefficient, Standard Error from multivariate pro bit analysis; *p<0.05 **p<0.01 ***p<0.001; 1 - Had health insurance the entire past year as reference; Logit 2 - multiple logistic regression; MVP 3 - Multivariate Probit Analysis 97 Table 27 Association between Regular Source of Care and Del ayed Medical Care and the Use of CAM in the Total P opulation Total N a%bTotal N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Regular source of care Doctor's 51.0% 805 23.3% 805 27.7% 805 OR cSE dOR SE OR SE OR SE OR SE OR 1.45** SE OR SE OR SE OR cSE 1.38* 0.22* 1.02 0.18 SE Coef SE Coef SE Coef SE 0.04 0.10 0.03 0.10 0.24* 0.12* 0.13 0.13 0.01 0.13 Logit (no usual place) OR cSE dOR SE OR SE OR SE OR SE 0.14 0.43 0.22 0.06 0.20 cSE dOR SE OR SE OR SE OR SE OR cSE 1.16 0.18 1.53* -0.04 0.10 0.16 0.11 0.05 0.11 Any CAM Herbal Medicine Meditation Chiropractic Acupuncture Hea ler Total Na - Actual total number of observations; % b - Column percentages (percentage may not total 100 due to rounding); OR c, SE d- Odds Ratio, Standard Error from multiple logistic regression analysis; Coef e, SE f - Coefficient, Standard Error from multivariate pro bit analysis; *p<0.05 **p<0.01 ***p<0.001; 1 - a doctor's office/clinic, 2- a public health clinic, community health center, hospital outpatient department or other places; Log it 3- multiple logistic regression; MVP 4 - multivariate probit analysis 98 4.4.2 Results Based on REI Population Tables 28-33 provide results of analyses examining the relationship between conventional measures of access and CAM use among e ach racial and ethnic population. Among Whites, significant associations are found be tween part year insurance and the use of herbal medicine and acupuncture and between no insurance the entire year and the use of herbal medicine, meditation, acupuncture and spiritual healing. Those who reported a public/community health center, a hospit al outpatient department, or some other kind of places as regular source of care are more likely to use any CAM, herbal medicine, chiropractic, acupuncture, or spiritual h ealing; those who have no usual place for care are more likely to use any CAM, chiropract ic, and spiritual healing. Those who delayed needed medical care are more likely to use herbal medicine. For Hispanics, those whose regular source of care a re hospital emergency rooms or urgent care centers are over three times as like ly to use any CAM, two times as likely to use herbal medicine, and four times as likely to use meditation and relaxation therapies comparing with the Hispanics who go to a physician' s office or clinic for routine care. Blacks who had health insurance only part of the ye ar had increased likelihood of using herbal medicine (OR=2.18) and the use of emergency room or urgent care center as their regular source of care was also significantly assoc iated with the use of meditation. In addition, Blacks having no usual place of care were more than four times as likely to use any CAM and seven times as likely to use herbal med icine. Analyses for the use of acupuncture and chiropracti c in American Indians could not be conducted due to small number of users of th e two therapies. Although those who did not have health insurance the entire past year were more likely than the insured to use 99 spiritual healing, due to the exceedingly large sta ndard errors, the results are not reported in the table. Among Asians, those uninsured part of the year were more likely than those insured all year to use meditation (OR=9.73); those whose regular source of care was emergency room or urgent care center are more likel y to use chiropractic than those whose regular place of care was doctor's office; an d those who did not have usual source of care and those who delayed medical care are more likely to use acupuncture (OR=7.41). Tables 34-36 show the comparisons of the associat ion between these measures of access to health care and CAM use between the US-bo rn and foreign-born. Based on Table 34, the part-year uninsured US-born were sign ificantly more likely than the fully insured to use any CAM (OR=1.56), herbal medicine ( OR=1.81), and meditation (OR=1.54); the entire-year uninsured US-born were m ore likely to use meditation (OR=1.83), acupuncture (OR=4.09), and spiritual hea ling (OR=2.70). The entire-year uninsured foreign-born are more likely to use herba l medicine (OR=3.86) and spiritual/traditional healing (OR=4.55). Table 35 shows the associations between having clin ics other than a doctor's office (e.g. a public/community health center, a ho spital outpatient department, or other kind of place) as regular source of care and the us e of CAM are significant among US- born for the use of any CAM, herbal medicine, chiro practic, acupuncture, and traditional or spiritual healing. US-born who have no usual pla ce of care are more likely to use any CAM, herbal medicine, chiropractic, and traditional or spiritual healing. In addition, those who go to emergency room or urgent care cente r for care are more likely to use any 100 CAM. However, no particular relationship is signifi cant based on analyses of the foreign- born. As shown in Table 36, delayed medical care was sign ificantly associated with the use of herbal medicine in both the US-born and fore ign-born. Specifically, compared to those whose care was not delayed, the foreign-born who reported having delayed needed medical care are nearly twice as likely to use herb al medicine as the non-US-born. 101 Table 28 Variation of the Association between Access to Hea lth Care and the Use of Any CAM by Race/Ethnicity Total N a%bTotal N % Total N % Total N % Total N % Health insurance coverage period Had insurance entire year (ref) 16558 41.0% 350 40.0% 791 41.6% 164 53.2% 535 40.3% insurance part year 465 56.0% 144 29.3% 343 42.1% 28 53.7% 59 62.5% No insurance entire year 219 67.7% 152 41.2% 82 51.1% 22 40.5% 28 45.3% OR cSE dOR SE OR SE OR SE OR SE Logit (part year insurance) 1.49 0.35 0.93 0.38 1.10 0.32 0.5 5.58 273 53.4% 142 54.8% 20 55.0% 45 62.2% No place 57.6% 39.1% 42 60.6% 7 89.3% 24 53.4% OR cSE dOR SE OR SE OR SE OR SE Logit (other clinic) 1.64** 0.30** 0.90 4. 19* 2.81* 9.48 19.75 3.19 309 51 47.0% Logit OR cSE dOR SE OR SE SE SE 1.21 0.22 3.34** 1.51** 0.74 0.30 0.24 0.31 0.99 0.54 American Indian White Hispanic Black Asian Total Na - Actual total number of observations;

Since no procedure is readily available to assess goodness-o f-fit for modeling data from complex sample surveys using STATA 8.0, this study uses a \" model-based\" analysis approach suggested by Hosmer and Lemeshow. That is, I assume the data comes from a simple random sample to assess the model fit. First, logis tic regression coefficients and standard errors were estimated using svylogit command. Then the logit command was used to fit the logistic models without adjusting for survey we ights and stratification. Hosmer- Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests were then applied an d median values from five regressions were chosen for multiple imputed models . Results from adjusted Wald tests indicate the overa ll significance of the model. The area under the receiver operating characteristi c (ROC) curve is another measure of how well the logistic regression performs. It measu res the likelihood that the predicted probability will be higher for the observed outcome of interest than the unobserved one (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2002). Table 37 presents the results of the goodness-of-fi t of the models based on the total population. Tables 38-42 are based on individ ual racial and ethnic populations. In general, the adjusted Wald tests indicate the overa ll models are highly significant, the Hosmer-Lemeshow tests indicate a good fit, and the area under the ROC curve suggests acceptable discrimination. 112 Table 37 Goodness-of-Fit of the Models Based on the Total P opulation Any CAM Herbal Medicine Meditation Chiropractic Acupuncture Healer Adjusted Wald Test 7.28 38 Goodness-of-Fit of the Models Based on White Any CAM Herbal Medicine Meditation Chiropractic Acupuncture Healer Adjusted Wald Test 5.93 5.26 39 Goodness-of-Fit of the Models Based on Hispanic Any CAM Herbal Medicine Meditation Chiropractic Acupuncture Healer Adjusted Wald Test 2.5 2.17 2.1 0.8816 0.8 411 Number of observations 655 637 637 645 651 640 113 Table 40 Goodness-of-Fit of the Models Based on Black Any CAM Herbal Medicine Meditation Chiropractic Acupuncture Healer Adjusted Wald Test 2.57 2.66 2.26 2.39 Goodness-of-Fit of the Models Based on American In dian Any CAM Herbal Medicine Meditation Chiropractic Acupuncture Healer Adjusted Wald Test 1.74 1.65 1.87 NA NA 2.42 chi2 0.4109 0.3607 0.294 0.845 NA NA 0.9015 Number of observations 210 236 208 NA NA 210 Table 42 Goodness-of-Fit of the Models Based on Asian Any CAM Herbal Medicine Meditation Chiropractic Acupuncture Healer Adjusted Wald Test 2.51 2.01 616 616 629 616 616 114 In section II, III, and IV, results from MVP analys es confirm the results from the univariate logit analyses, particularly the directi ons and significance of the associations among variables of interest. Odds ratios from univa riate logit are then reported for more intuitive understanding. However, if future studies need to obtain the joint and/or conditional probabilities of CAM use and more quant itatively accurate estimations, MVP should be considered given the fact that the use of individual CAM associates highly with other CAM and error terms across equations are also positively related as shown in Tables 9-15. 115 CHAPTER 5. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION Though the results of census 2010 are yet to be rev ealed, one undeniable trend of the nation's population is its growing proportion o f people of color and foreign-born, who is estimated to account for over half of the total population by 2042 and be a 54% of the U.S. residents by 2050 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2008c). The development of effective health policies, programs and clinical guidelines addressi ng the needs of the increasingly diverse population and tackling one of most troubling aspec ts of the U.S. health care system - racial and ethnic health disparities, requires a cl ear understanding of the health care practices among these population groups. The purpos e of this study is to add to the literature of CAM research by examining the variati ons of the use of CAM and to determine the influence of factors such as culture, acculturation, and access to conventional health care among racial, ethnic and i mmigrant (REI) populations. This chapter provides a summary of key study findings es tablished in Chapter 4, describes their meanings and discusses the implications of th e results. It is organized into the following three sections: Section 1 summarizes the overall findings; Section 2 presents limitations of the study; and Section 3 discusses t he policy implications of this research and outlines areas for future research. Section 1. Summary and Discussion of Findings As outlined in Chapter 1, one of the strengths of t his study is its use of SHAPE, a data source collected with oversampled REI populati ons. SHAPE was designed to generate a sufficient number of respondents in each of five racial and ethnic groups 116 (White, Hispanic, Black, Asian, and American Indian ) to allow for separate and specific reports for each group. In addition, the survey was translated and conducted in four languages besides English (Spanish, Somali, Hmong, and Vietnamese) to capture information from immigrant respondents who spoke th ose languages. Recent national surveys documented wide spread and increasing use of CAM by Americans as a whole, but the use of CAM in minorit y and immigrant populations is largely less known. For example, studies of CAM use lack representation as they are restricted to subjects with particular health condi tions, or are based on convenience samples focusing on one particular racial and ethni c group, and therefore prevent comparisons across REI groups (Alferi, et al., 2001 ; Allen, Cushman, Morris, Feldman, Wade, McMahon, et al., 2000; Arcury, et al., 1996; Bair, et al., al., 2000; Cherniack 2008; Cushman, al., 2000; Loera et al., 2007; Lopez, 2005; Mehta et al., 2007; Shapiro & Gong, 20 02). Moreover, prior studies lack sufficient data to draw conclusions regarding the r ole culture and acculturation play on CAM use. Furthermore, although unmet health care needs due t o cost have been indicated to relate to the use of CAM among adults in the U.S. ( Pagan & Pauly, 2005), little is known regarding the role access of conventional health ca re plays on the use of CAM in REI populations. In addition, no study was located that examines the association between different sources of regular care and CAM use in ei ther the total population or among specific REI groups. 117 This study addresses these gaps in the literature a nd applies the adapted Behavioral Model of Vulnerable Population (BMVP) wi th added REI domains. BMVP was developed due to the observation that the conve ntional Andersen's behavioral model had not adequately accounted for specific socio-str uctural characteristics and challenges certain vulnerable population groups face when obta ining needed health care services. The BMVP adapted for this study adds REI domains to the traditional domains in the conventional behavioral model. REI domains are also categorized by predisposing, enabling and need components. This study set out to examine the following researc h questions: 1) what is the prevalence of CAM use, and does use vary by REI? 2) are attitudes and adherence to cultural heritage and the degree of acculturation a ssociated with the use of CAM? 3) are people from certain REI population groups lacking a ccess to conventional health care more likely to use CAM? Study findings for each qu estion are summarized as follows. 5.1.1 Prevalence of CAM Use in the Total Population CAM use is widespread in the total population of He nnepin Country in Minnesota. Overall, 42.4% of people used at least o ne of the five CAM therapies in 2002. Self-administered CAM therapies are used at a highe r rate than provider-administered CAM with over 20% of people using herbal medicine a nd meditation and relaxation therapies. While 13.8% of people used chiropractic care, acupuncture and traditional/spiritual healing are used at relativel y low rates of 3.8% and 4.4%. By and large, the demographic profile of CAM users in the total population found in this study 118 conforms to the pattern found in the literature: fe males, people with higher education and within the age range of 35 to 54 are greater users of CAM (Astin, 1998; Bausell, et al., 2001; Eisenberg, et al., 1998). The findings suggest that more Minnesotans overall use CAM than the national average which was reported as 36% based on 2002 NHI S (Barnes, et al., 2004). The prevalence of the use of individual CAM therapies i s also higher than reported national average (nonvitamin, nonmineral natural products: 2.0%) (Barnes, et al ., 2004). This higher magnitude of CAM use is consistent with the finding of a previou s study indicating that people living in the West and Midwest are more likely to use CAM than those living in Northeast and South (Ni, et al., 2002). In terms of the most commonly used individual CAM t herapies, this study found that herbal medicine and meditation are more common ly used while other studies report different patterns. By contrast, the most common CA M therapies in other studies were relaxation therapy (Eisenberg, et al., 1998), chiro practic (Astin, 1998; Druss & Rosenheck, 1999), and spiritual healing prayer (Ni, et al., 2002). These discrepancies are largely the result of a lack of consensus in the de finition of CAM, in addition to differences in sampling frame, survey modality (e.g . during a face-to-face interview people may be more reluctant to discuss CAM use tha n they are with the relative anonymity of a telephone interview), and sample rep resentation. Though CAM is referred as those health care practices not currently an int egral part of conventional medicine, the 119 number, type, and definition of CAM therapies in in dividual studies vary widely. For example, some studies did not separate prayer from spiritual healing (Druss & Rosenheck, 1999) while others excluded prayer in th e survey (Eisenberg, et al., 1998; Eisenberg, et al., 1993). Herbal medicine is someti mes asked together with functional food and animal-based supplement as nonvitamin and nonmineral natural products (Barnes, et al., 2004) while is specified as herbs or herbal remedies in other studies (Bair et al., 2005; Elder, et al., 1997). Though the prevalence of the use of individual CAM therapies needs to be verified in future studies and communities of CAM r esearchers are working toward reaching consensus about what constitutes CAM, the considerably wide practice of CAM in the general population is unequivocal. Further, an increased number of medical schools are offering curriculum incorporating CAM, and phys icians report referring their patients for CAM treatments (Berman, 2001; Borkan, Neher, An son, nberg, 2003). This continuing and increasing trend encouraging CAM use is expected to persist as we move toward implementing health policies emphasizing health pro motion and disease prevention as part of health care reform and more conventional he alth care providers get involved in the provision of CAM. 5.1.2 Variation and Difference of CAM use among REI populations 120 CAM is also prevalent among REI populations. Findi ngs indicate that 42.4% of the White, 38.6% of the Hispanic, 42.3% of the Blac k, 50.9% of the American Indian, 43.4% of the Asian, and 39.2% of the immigrants use d at least one CAM in 2001. Prior research exploring variation in CAM use by REI yiel d mixed results. For example, it has been reported that all ethnic groups are equally li kely to use at least one of five CAM therapies including herbal medicine, acupuncture, c hiropractic, traditional healer, and home remedy (Mackenzie, et al., 2003). Others show variation by cultural group using data from the 2002 NHIS and 1996 MEPS when prayers are excluded (Barnes, et al., 2004; Keith, Kronenfeld, Rivers, & Liang, 2005). Th e results of this study suggest that the prevalence of CAM use is higher among American Indians, Asians and Whites. Possible reason for the lower prevalence of CAM use in Blacks and Hispanics might be the exclusion and lack of specification, o f the CAM therapies that are culturally relevant and popular among the two ethnic populatio ns. For example, previous research found that non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics were m ore likely than other racial and ethnic groups to use prayers (Barnes, et al., 2004; Graham, et al., 2005). Thus, the exclusion of prayer and home remedies which have al so been closely associated with Black culture, might have contributed to the lower prevalence of CAM use among these two population groups. In addition, as discussed ea rlier, the term used for some CAM in the survey might be less clear and subject to inter pretation, particularly among some racial and ethnic populations and immigrants. For e xample, the term \"traditional healer\" is often heard in academic circles and might not be as familiar among Hispanics or Blacks in the general population. The results might have been different if questions about 121 visits to a curandero, medicine man or root-worker were used in the survey. Nonetheless, the findings of our study show that use of CAM in s ome form is prevalent among all ethnic groups and as such, is probably an important component of delivering culturally competent care. This study also suggests that CAM use is not only p revalent but also varied among REI populations. As hypothesized, the use of individual CAM varies significantly across racial and ethnic populations and the patter n of use conforms to the racial and ethnic origins of the modalities. For example, sign ificantly higher percentages of Asians used acupuncture, herbal medicine and traditional h ealers, which are major and essential components of traditional Asian medicine. Though of ten omitted from surveys of CAM use, the results show that American Indians are sig nificantly more likely to practice traditional and spiritual healing than Whites and H ispanics. In addition, visits to chiropractors among Whites are much higher than amo ng the other five racial and ethnic groups, and are significantly higher than that of B lacks and American Indians. Regarding CAM use among immigrants, studies documen ting the prevalence and influence of birth-place on CAM use in the United S tates are limited. One study found that foreign-born Mexicans were more likely than th e US-born Mexicans to consult folk medicine practitioners (Higginbotham, et al., 1990) . By contrast, in the present study, birth-place did not influence CAM use except that f oreign-born respondents were less likely to visit chiropractors. Furthermore, contras ting immigrants versus non-immigrants within racial and ethnic groups (not shown in table s) does not render conclusive evidence supporting immigrant status as a predictor of CAM u se. Even though foreign-born Asian 122 were more likely than the US-born Asians to use acu puncture in bivariate analysis, the difference becomes non-significant after adjusting for other factors. The negative association between the use of chiropr actics and being foreign-born may be due to the fact that visiting a chiropractor could pose greater financial burden to immigrants, as higher percentages of the foreign-bo rn than native-born live below the poverty level and are less likely to have health in surance coverage (Camarota, 2009; U.S. Census Bureau, 2002). In addition, lack of sufficie nt knowledge about chiropractics by immigrants could contribute to their relatively low er utilization rates. The lack of evidence for an association between birth-place and other CAM use could result from a lack of sufficient numbers of the US-born or foreig n-born in some racial and ethnic groups in the study sample. For example, only 8.5% of Asians are US-born and the percentages of the US-born Blacks, Whites, and Amer ican Indians are 78.3%, 97.3% and 96.6% respectively. Furthermore, birth-place itself may not meaningfully capture the concept of acculturation. Taking other indicators i nto account, such as length of residence and language spoken and health beliefs may improve our understanding of CAM use among immigrants as shown in the next section. 5.1.3 Influence of Cultural Heritage and Acculturat ion on the Use of CAM Among REI Populations The relationship between culture, health-related b eliefs and behaviors is complex and one's attitudes and beliefs about health, disea se and health care are clearly shaped by the culture to which one belongs. Though it has bee n proposed as part of heritage consistency theory that the deeper people identify with their traditional heritage, the 123 greater the chance they will follow traditional hea lth and illness beliefs and practices derived from their ethno-cultural heritage, few stu dies evaluate the proposition and no study was found that examines the association in th e context of the use of CAM (Bates & Edwards, 1992; Spector, 1989, 1995, 2002). Literature on the influence of acculturation among immigrant populations has mainly focused on health conditions, behaviors, the use of preventive services, or adherence to health care (Barron, Hunter, Mayo, & W illoughby, 2004; Evenson, Sarmiento, & Ayala, 2004; Jaber, Brown, Hammad, Zhu , & Herman, 2003; Palmer, Fernandez, Tortolero-Luna, 2004; W u, Black, & Markides, 2001). Two more recent studies investigated the relationship b etween acculturation and the use of CAM but identified conflicting patterns (Ferro, et al., 2007; Su, et al., 2008). The questions asked in SHAPE 2002 regarding indicat ors of cultural heritage and acculturation allowed this current study to explore the extent to which cultural heritage and acculturation are associated with variation in CAM use. The findings indicate that 1) overall, the degree to which people of different ra cial and ethnic groups hold on to their cultural heritage influences their choice of CAM th erapies; 2) the level of influence is stronger for culturally-relevant CAM therapies; 3) contrary to our hypothesis, those who are less acculturated (are the most recent immigran ts), are less likely to use certain CAM therapies. As one stays longer, one's likelihood of CAM use becomes indistinguishable from the US-born; 4) language spoken for the interv iew does not appear to significantly influence CAM use. It has been suggested that those who are recent immigrants, live in 124 ethnic enclaves, prefer to use their native tongue, are educated in their country of origin, migrate back and forth to their country of origin, and maintain contact with older individuals with a high degree of ethnic identity a re more likely to adhere to ethnocultural beliefs and behaviors (Higginbotham, et al., 1990; Pachter, 1994). However, this study does not find that the less acculturated are more l ikely to use CAM. Instead, as immigrants become more acculturated, their likeliho od of CAM use increases. Possible reasons are 1) the proxies of acculturatio n measured in SHAPE may not capture the dynamic and complex dimensions of accul turation; 2) finding an available and trustworthy traditional healer might be more di fficult for the most recent immigrants who do not have established social networks to help locate these culturally relevant health resources; 2) the cost of seeing a tradition al healer might also pose a greater burden for recent immigrants who have been shown to have lower economic status; 3) lack of sufficient number of immigrants with variou s lengths of residence in the sample makes it harder to reach statistical significance; 4) the percentage of the population whose interview language is non-English (5%) may be too small to allow for accurate assessment of the association for this indicator; 5 ) The actual relationship between acculturation and the use of certain CAM therapies may be curvilinear. Further research is necessary to investigate the shape and degree of these relationships. The results of this study point to the role cultura l heritage plays in the use of CAM. CAM, as defined by interventions not taught wi dely in the medical schools and not generally available in US hospitals or clinics, inc ludes an array of modalities that have gained enormous popularity in the general populatio n of the United States in the past two 125 decades. Besides dissatisfaction with conventional medical treatment and perceived efficacy of CAM, studies indicate the reasons peopl e are motivated to use CAM is CAM's congruence with personal values, philosophica l orientations towards health and life, self actualization and individual responsibil ity (Astin, 1998; Barnes, et al., 2004; Siahpush, 1999). In addition, the results of this s tudy point out that the desire to maintain and pass along one's cultural heritage serves as an other important factor in the use of CAM. The study also contributes to the literature acknow ledging the potential for a stronger connection to maintaining one's cultural h eritage and the use of culturally and ethnically relevant CAM therapies in racial, ethnic and immigrant populations. The use of traditional and culturally familiar therapies by pe ople of REI backgrounds may not only reflect their desire to maintain the consistency an d continuity of cultural traditions, but also efforts to cope with health issues by clinging to their traditional cultural norms. 5.1.4 Influence of Access to Conventional Health Ca re on CAM use among REI Populations The results suggest that 1) lack of insurance cove rage, delayed medical care, and not having a physician's clinic or office as routin e source of care all contribute to higher likelihood of the use of CAM; 2) a lack of access t o conventional health care has a stronger influence on the use of CAM therapies in s ome racial and ethnic population groups; 3) lack of insurance coverage and barriers to needed medical care may sway immigrants to resort to culturally familiar CAM. 126 More specifically, it is found that lack of insuran ce, particularly having no insurance coverage during the entire year, is a str ong predictor of the use of any CAM and individual CAM therapies except chiropractic ca re. And, compared to reporting going to a physician's clinic or office for regular care, people reporting other places (a public health clinic, community health center, a ho spital emergency room, an urgent care center, and some other kind of place or no usual pl ace) as their regular source of care are also significantly more likely to use CAM. Furtherm ore, reports of delayed medical care were found to significantly relate to the use of he rbal medicine. The association between having regular source of ca re in a public health clinic, community health center or a hospital outpatient de partment and the use of all forms of CAM except for meditation and relaxation therapies is particularly noteworthy. People using these sources are known to differ from patien ts who go to a doctor's office in terms of demographic, socioeconomic characteristics and h ealth insurance status (Forrest & Whelan, 2000). People who rely more on Medicaid, Me dicare, or public sources of payment are more likely to seek care in hospital ou tpatient settings or other safe-net providers such as community health centers (Burt & Schappert, 2004). People visiting hospital outpatient departments are less likely to see the same health care provider and less likely to have continuity of ongoing care (Bur t & Schappert, 2004). CAM, with its emphasis on holism, interrelation and integration o f care, may provide certain aspects of needed care otherwise lacking for these people ther eby filling the gap between health care needs and access. 127 Disruption of ongoing health care is aggravated whe n a person has no regular place to go or has to rely on the emergency room (E R) for regular care (Burt & Schappert, 2004; McCaig & Burt, 2004). The situatio n is particularly prevalent among Hispanics and Blacks of whom approximately 20% do n ot have a regular place for care or rely on ER. These individuals are also significa ntly more likely to use CAM. Compared to Whites, Blacks without a regular source of care are nearly twice as likely to use any CAM and over three times as likely to use h erbal medicine. While no significant association was found between the use of an emergen cy room for regular care and CAM in the general population, Hispanics and Blacks who se regular source of care is the ER or urgent care center are four and two times as likely to use meditation and relaxation therapies than those who report a physician's offic e as their regular source of care. Asians without health insurance the entire year are more t han nine times as likely as the fully insured to use meditation and relaxation therapies. Asians who report delaying needed care are over seven times more likely to see a trad itional healer. If people from racial and ethnic minorities are mor e likely to experience barriers accessing to medical care as reported in the litera ture, immigrants are doubly disadvantaged due to language difficulties, cultura l adjustments, and cognitive barriers to conventional health care system (Agency for Healthc are Research and Quality, 2003, 2005, 2007; Centers for Disease Control & Preventio n, 2005; Institue of Medicine, 2002; Leclere, et al., 1994; Phillips, et al., 2000; Wein ick, et al., 2000). Immigrants, particularly recent immigrants, were less likely than the US-bor n or longer-term immigrants to receive timely health care. That foreign-born witho ut insurance have a significantly 128 higher likelihood of using herbal medicine and trad itional healing than the US-born also suggests that CAM therapies might play a more impor tant role among immigrants experiencing difficulties in accessing medical care . Section 2. Study Limitations The results summarized in the previous section must be considered in the context of several limitations. The first is potential samp le coverage bias in that SHAPE is primarily a telephone survey and not all Minnesotan 's have telephones. However, this bias should be small given that almost all (92.2%) Hennepin County households had telephone service (according to the 2000 U.S. Censu s). Second, although SHAPE collects an array of information that reflect enabling facto rs, other factors that influence utilization are not captured such as: ratios of hea lth personnel and facilities to the population, the physical or time distance between r espondents and health facilities. However, given that the sample was drawn from a met ropolitan area, it is assumed that the availability of health care personnel and facil ities does not have significant variability across respondents. Third, SHAPE measures insurance status but we do no t know what benefits are or are not covered. Lack of information on specific co vered benefits for chiropractic or acupuncture may have resulted in the negative findi ngs of the associations between access factors and the use of chiropractic and acup uncture. Also missing is the amount of co-payment which may impact use of both conventiona l and CAM services. Potential biases created due to the lack of this information must be considered, though they are not 129 expected to be significant considering the fact tha t all public and private health insurances covered chiropractic and only two health plans in Minnesota provided coverage for acupuncture with limitations (12 in-ne twork acupuncture visits) and restrictions (e.g. chronic pain) (First Plan of Min nesota, 2005). Fourth, the lack of information on the number of v isits respondents paid to CAM and/or conventional care providers prevents more de tailed analyses of the levels of influences on CAM use. Fifth, though respondents th at were not from Southeast Asia were included, one of the targeted racial and ethni c groups was Southeast Asians (75.7%). Thus, inferences from the results for the Asian population can be made only to Southeast Asians who had similar population charact eristics as those living in Hennepin County. Sixth, there is no attention to the diversity amon g other sub-populations within the broader race and ethnic categories (e.g., Hispanic or Latino are overarching labels for many subcultures including Mexican, Puerto Rican, C uban, Columbian, Central American, South American, Dominican, or Spaniard). Because tradition and culture vary among the subcategories of the racial and ethnic gr oups, the lack of differentiation does not allow for a more thorough analysis of the racia l and ethnic subgroups. Having said that, the sample size does not support further subd ivision of the analysis within these race and ethnic groups. Seventh, the cross-sectional nature of the data pre vents us from affirming the causal effect of predisposing and enabling factors on the use of CAM. However, the behavioral model of vulnerable population (BMVP) re vised and applied in the study 130 suggests that the use of health care and services i s a function of influential factors while recognizing the dynamic nature of the model, with o utcomes influencing subsequent predisposition, enabling resources, need, and healt h behaviors (Andersen, 1995). It is reasonable to suggest that the factors of interest here may be influential to, and predictors of, the use of CAM. However, only future studies u sing longitudinal data would allow us to draw definitive conclusions. Eighth, this study is based on the data from the su rvey conducted in 2002, the prevalence of CAM use found may not reflect the cur rent circumstances. A more recent survey conducted in 2006 would provide a more updat ed profile of CAM use. Unfortunately, 2006 SHAPE did not include one of th is study's key variables, information about cultural heritage; therefore, the analysis is conducted on the 2002 SHAPE. Future research should explore whether the p atterns of CAM and its associations with access to medical care described here hold ove r time. Nineth, it is also important to mention that attitu des towards cultural heritage, participation of cultural activities, language used at the interview, birth place, and length of residence used in the study are proxy measures o f the more complex concepts of cultural belief, cultural identification and accult uration which require extensive measures and multi-item scales to obtain high validity and r eliability (Cuellar, Nyberg, Maldonado, et al., 1998; Rhoades, Manson, Noonan, & Buchwald, 2005). Detailed inquiries based on comprehensive scales, such as the extent to which o ne celebrates one's holidays, eats 131 one's own ethnic foods, feels accepted by members ( friends, relatives, or coworkers) of one's own ethnic group, will be helpful for future research to further validate the findings of the study. Tenth, though SHAPE includes questions about cultur al beliefs, community support and social connections, it does not collect the information of attitudes and beliefs towards CAM and conventional medicine, including tr ust or mistrust, which have been indicated to influence CAM use (Astin, 1998; Carey, Forey, 1994; Sung, 1999). Other pre disposing factors influencing CAM use, particularly among immigrant populations, such as influence from family members (Feldmann, Wiemann, Sever, & Hergenroeder, 2008; Robinson et al., 2008; Trangmar & Diaz, 2008), were also not captured adeq uately in SHAPE. Finally, although the oversampled racial and ethnic minority populations in the data allow for racial and ethnic specific analyses, some detailed analyses could not be conducted due to small sample size in some sub-popu lations such as cohorts of immigrants with shorter length of residence and use of certain CAM among some racial and ethnic populations. Nevertheless, though SHAPE is a geographically boun d sample and generalizing the study results, especially the prevalence of CAM use, requires discretion, the unique representation of immigrants in the sample together with indicators of health care access and cultural beliefs balance out these limitations and speak to the merits of the study to inform our understandings of CAM use among REI popu lations. 132 Section 3. Implications and Future Research This study contributes to the literature in health services research by adapting the Behavioral Model of Vulnerable Population (BMVP) to explain the use of CAM among REI populations. Factors not commonly included in t he Andersen's behavioral model and characteristics specific to the REI population as i ncluded in the BMVP are important in the study of the use of CAM. Thus, future health se rvices research of CAM use in REI populations should take factors not generally inclu ded in the conventional behavior model into consideration. While increasing prevalence of the use of CAM has b een documented widely in the literature, studies of the patterns of and fact ors associated with its use in racial, ethnic, and immigrant populations are rather limited. The r esults of this study show high prevalence of the use of the five CAM therapies in individual racial and ethnic populations ranging from nearly forty percent among Hispanics to over fifty percent among American Indians. National surveys of CAM sho uld include sufficient numbers of REI populations in order to adequately represent an d reflect the changing demographics of the nation. The study results also reveal that CAM is not a gro up of homogenous therapies. CAM use not only varies with racial and ethnic back grounds, modalities, but also with cultural heritage. Many CAM are actually convention al therapies for people of various racial and ethnic backgrounds from other countries and cultural heritages and beliefs persistently influence people's health care choices . Providers increasingly encounter 133 diverse patient populations from a myriad of ethni c and culture backgrounds as racial/ethnic groups and immigrants will count for over ninety percent of the population growth and will constitute 54 percent of the total population in the United States by 2050 (Bernstein & Edwardw, 2008; U.S. Census Bureau, 200 8b). Patients of racial and ethnic minority and immigran ts groups receive, with significant frequency, suboptimal care even if they have the same health insurance coverage and similar access to conventional health care as the dominant groups (Institute of Medicine, 2002). Though many factors contribute to inequalities including health care systems, administrative processes, health care prov iders and patients, one of the causes inadequately recognized is lack of acknowledgement and validation of the deep-rooted cultural aspects of identity in health care access, utilization and outcomes. The challenging task of increasing culturally competent care and reducing health inequalities is difficult to accomplish without addressing the i ssue from a broader perspective beyond provider and patient education. One way is to build effective coordination channels between CAM providers and conventional health practitioners to ensure continu ity of care and prevent inadvertent drug-herb interactions. Effective credentialing and regulation systems for CAM provider and therapies also need to be established to increa se public trust and legislative integrity while maintaining traditions and the treatment phil osophy of CAM. Health insurance coverage of CAM varies with modalities and health p lans because some insurers believe CAM saves costs while others consider the evidence of efficacy and cost-effectiveness of CAM inadequate for reimbursement (Eisenberg, et al. , 2002). More clinical and 134 economic evidence is needed to better inform legisl ative decision and the insurance industry. Although cultural attributes are explanatory fact ors of CAM use, the study also suggests that CAM may have served as an alternative option for those who lack adequate access to conventional health care, particularly fo r immigrants and people of racial and ethnic minorities. Despite significant and concerte d efforts made on a number of fronts, little progress has been made toward eliminating he alth care disparities among immigrants and people of racial and ethnic minoriti es (Bach, 2005; Beach, et al., 2006; Siegel, et al., 2004; Williams, 2005). Based on new ly-released data from the Current Population Survey, 34.5% and 13.0 million of immig rants were uninsured in 2009, which increased from 33.5% and 12.3 million in 200 8 (Denavas-Walt, Proctor, & Smith, 2010). Uninsured populations are also more likely t o not have a regular source of care, use emergency room as regular source of care and to have delayed needed medical care (James, Thomas, Lilli-Blanton, & Garfield, 2007). The unprecedented economic downturn starting in lat e 2008 also exacerbated the situation faced by these vulnerable populations. La ck of access to adequate medical care is projected to worsen in the next several years. A recent study estimated that about 7 million Americans will lose insurance coverage in t he next two years based on the effect of recession alone (not job loss) and every racial and ethnic group will be affected (Families USA, 2009). The troubling projections and dire effects of escalating health care cost for both individuals and businesses set in mot ion steadfast efforts for the federal health reform of the nation. 135 The newly passed Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) provides historical opportunities and crucial first steps to address health disparities through a number of key provisions including expanding health insurance coverage, improving data collection on racial and ethnic minority population s, increasing funding for community health centers and increasing work force diversity. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 95% of the population will have insu rance coverage and an additional 32 million uninsured will be offered insurance startin g in 2014 under the new legislation. Although the provision of insurance coverage under PPACA for immigrants may decrease the number of CAM users, the actual impact is yet to be determined considering the fact that insurance coverage is only one indica tor of health care access and undocumented immigrants would probably continue to rely upon community health centers or other safety-net providers and resort to CAM for care. The causes of health disparities are broad and comp lex and the alleviation and eventual elimination of disparities requires target ed, consistent, and coordinated efforts. It has been amply documented that members of racial an d ethnic minority groups receive fewer health care services and lower quality of car e than majority patients and morbidity and mortality rates for many diseases remain higher for Blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Asians even after health insurance sta tus is controlled (Anachebe & Sutton, 2003; Baskin, et al., 2005; Cone, et al., 2003; Cra wley, 2005; Dominick & 2004; of Medicine, 2002; Ke lley, et al., 2005; Kirk, et al., 2005; Li, 2005). Other factors including cultural prefere nces, mistrust of health care providers, language barriers, transportation difficulties, ava ilability of health care resources all 136 contribute to race- and ethnicity-based health disp arities (Cohen & Christakis, 2006; Shih, Zhao, & Elting, 2006; Sung, 1999). CAM, as an affordable and accessible form of care, is often used as a conventional form of care worldwide. For example, u p to eighty percent of the population in Africa use CAM to meet their health care needs a nd in China, an estimated forty percent of health care is delivered in the form of CAM (World Health Organization, 2002). For people of racial, ethnic and immigrant g roups, CAM therapies and services have potential advantages in the delivery of cultur ally relevant health care and can contribute to the goal of reducing health dispariti es. The American health care system suffers from the co nsequences of high rates of preventable diseases and disproportionally poorer h ealth outcomes and suboptimal health care relative to its exceedingly high and increasin g health care cost. Unlike modern biomedicine which specializes in acute care, many C AM modalities emphasize disease prevention, health maintenance and promotion, which is one of the provisions of PPACA. The new reform law mandates the creation of a new N ational Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council within the Dep artment of Health and Human Service. The law specifies that a presidentially ap pointed 25-member Advisory Group to the Council must include \"licensed integrated healt h providers.\" This provision creates organizational structures for coordinated efforts b etween CAM and conventional health care providers to target these problems facing Amer ican health care. Cost-saving potentials of certain CAM therapies hav e been documented (Stano, 1993; Ziegler, 1997). A newly published study compa ring health care expenditures 137 among insured users and nonusers of CAM found patie nts who use CAM providers for some of their care have lower expenditures as a gro up than a matched group of patients who do not use CAM, and the differences in expendit ures is related in large part to less inpatient care and less use of high-tech imaging (L ind, Lafferty, & Tyree, 2010). In the face of escalating health care costs, heightened at tention should be paid to the potential of CAM in meeting the health care needs of Americans, particularly underserved and vulnerable populations. While reducing and ultimate ly eliminating health care disparities requires a multifaceted approach and remains a chal lenging goal, exploring the merits of CAM is one plausible and viable option. Future rese arch is needed to examine the role CAM could play in the effort to reduce health dispa rities among racial, ethnic, and immigrant populations. Establishing a firm foundation through rigorous res earch about the efficacy, effectiveness, and cost saving potentials of CAM, a nd its applications to both health promotions and illness management and in specific p opulations is a first step. Health services research in the area of CAM use among REI populations is particularly scarce and should be conducted accordingly. In addition, w hile this study found that cultural factors and access to conventional health care infl uence CAM use among REI populations, other factors that may influence CAM u se also need to be examined in future studies to further our understandings of CAM use among racial, ethnic and immigrant populations. These factors include health beliefs of patients, availability of CAM providers and facilities, informal referral net works from friends and family 138 members, characteristics of clinicians providing ca re such as whether they speak the patient's native languages. Complementary and alternative medicine is an import ant and inseparable part of health care from people of racial, ethnic and immig rant communities, often serving as more culturally relevant, accessible, and affordabl e care. CAM may also provide a vehicle for education of self-care, disease prevent ion, and health promotion for people in underserved communities who lack adequate access to regular medical care. As the nation becomes increasingly diverse in the coming d ecades, the challenge to eliminate health disparities is difficult to meet without a c lear understanding the health care practices in these populations. This study contribu tes to the small but growing body of literature on CAM use among diverse populations and to our knowledge of racial, ethnic, and immigration differences in CAM use. Future rese arch in the area of CAM use and health disparities in the REI population will be in dispensible in providing comprehensive and high quality care to the myriad of cultural gro ups in this country. 139 Bibliography Aday.
