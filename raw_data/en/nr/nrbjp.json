Until now, choices were limited if you wanted to learn how instrument assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) could integrate into your patient and athlete care. You had to buy expensive tools and attend an expensive class that locked you into one way of utilizing IASTM. Not anymore. FMT Blades is an eight hour IASTM certification led by industry leading experts in movement assessment and therapy and you get to keep the tools you use in the class. FMT Blades introduces the concept of movement therapyand performance enhancement via instrument assisted softtissue mobilization (IASTM). The tools may be hard-edged,but the techniques don't need to be aggressive to deliver superior patient outcomes.The FMT Blades certification will review screening dysfunc- tional movement patterns and utilizing soft tissue tools to improve patient treatment. The anatomy, physiology, and most importantly, the neurology of myofascial soft tissue work is covered, along with supporting research. IASTM intervention strategies will also be combined with kinesiology taping and corrective exercise techniques todeliver a comprehensive approach to patient care.

Quick Tip Bendalittlewith pediatricpatients Doesn't it feel better when people communicate with you on your level? Successful teams know how to \"mirror and match.\" This is essential with all clients and crucial with children. Children can feel if you are genuinely interested in them, and getting down on yourknees or sitting on the floor enables you to mirror and match them to ultimately build rapport and trust. If your purpose is to care for families and particularly children, then be prepared to play, have fun, sit on the floor, and enjoy the scenery from the child's level. \u2014TheCenterforPowerfulPractices, powerful-practices.com28 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS J U N E 7, 2 0 1 6 CHIROECO.COMBLACKMOON9/THINKSTOCKCHIROECO.COM J U N E 7, 2 0 1 6 CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 29Achiropractic practice' s goal should be for patients to achieve thegreatest response to care in the shortest amount of path to patient wellness.
