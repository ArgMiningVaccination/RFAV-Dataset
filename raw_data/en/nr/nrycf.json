At its heart, Religious and Spiritual Life is a prophetic and pastoral presence which seeks to enhance the spiritual and ethical educational experience of the whole person mind, body, and soul. Chaplains and campus ministers have a unique role in a campus community. We seek to be both spiritual supporters and active participants in the life of the university. It is not uncommon that one might encounter a chaplain or a campus minister at a religious service. However, it is also just as likely that one might run into us at a lecture, an athletic event or just hanging out on campus. In the midst of the temporal, we aspire to bear witness to the sacred. We are open-minded, open-hearted and thoroughly committed to your religious and spiritual well-being. In times of joy and of sorrow we are dedicated to being a caring, gentle, accessible presence to all students, faculty, and staff. We consider ourselves quite blessed to be part of a community of scholars, seekers, and believers walking together on a remarkable journey of spiritual awakening and human flourishing.
