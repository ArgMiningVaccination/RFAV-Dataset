NEJM August 25, 2016 Department of Surgery Division of Public Health Sciences Evidence evolving From only a couple of prospective cohorts in 2002, adding ACS mortality in 2003 Now evidence from 30 to 50 or more prospective cohorts Pooled analysis of individual participant data from studies addressing BMI and less common cancers Department of Surgery Division of Public Health Sciences Why prospective studies and pooled data Measure adiposity and risk of subsequent cancer Avoid weight change due to disease Department of Surgery Division of Public Health Sciences Individual participant data - pooled analysis IPD meta-analyses can improve the quality of data and the type of analyses that can be done and produce more reliable results (Stewart and Tierney 2002). For this reason they are considered to be a 'gold standard' of systematic review. In fact, IPD meta-analyses have produced definitive answers to clinical questions, which might not have been obtained from summary data. Cochrane Handbook Ch 18 and IPD methods Department of Surgery Division of Public Health Sciences Pancreas More than 20 prospective studies and case- control studies indicating a positive dose- response relation. Observed in the large majority of studies and in both genders. Compared to normal weigh, the RR for overweight was 1.18 (1.03-1.36) and for obesity 1.47 (1.23-1.75), estimated from pooled analysis of 14 cohorts [Genkinger 2011].
