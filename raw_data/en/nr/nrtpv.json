Nearly 200 years ago, a small group of dedicated Baltimore physicians began the instruction of medical students at the College of Medicine of Maryland. Five years later, in 1812, the University of Maryland received its charter. That same year thestructure now known as Davidge Hall was erected at Lombard and Greene streets\u2014 and the University of Maryland was born. The building featured on the cover of this issue of Maryland magazine is our most tangible link to those early medical pioneers. But Davidge Hall is much more than a building named after the founder and dean of the nation's first public medical school\u2014 it is an enduring symbol of the many lives that have been enriched through our mission of education, research, public service, and patient care. Those founders from two centuries ago would be astounded if they could view our vibrant campus today. From their determined efforts to educate physicians using sound scientific principles, the U niversity of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) has evolved into a dynamic multidisciplinary campus of 60 acres with seven professional schools, more than 5,600 students, and 6,600 faculty and staff. As we celebrate the bicentennial of our School of Medicine, our vision is focused firmly on the future. Just as Davidge Hall was hailed as an architectural and techno- logical mar vel of its time, so too is our new Dental School setting trends for dental education and clinical car eworldwide. I nthe ne wbuilding, faculty and clinicians not only educate the majority of M aryland 'sdentists, but they also tr eat mor ethan 35,000 Marylanders annually. In keeping with our integrated mission of education, research, and service, we opened our sev enth pr ofessional school, the School of Public Health, in 2006. The newschool will implement an inter disciplinary approach to tackle the tough public health issues facing our city and state. Also in 2006, we welcomed two dynamic deans to our campus: E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, as vice president for medical affairs at the University of Maryland, John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor, and dean of the School of Medicine; and Richard P . Barth, PhD, MSW,dean of the School of Social Work. Our pioneering efforts to build a thriving biotechnology community in West Baltimor eare meeting with great success. In the UMB BioPark's Building One, bio- medical researchers are collaborating with biotechnology leaders to develop treatments for some of society 'smajor diseases. The B ioPark is flourishing, and Building T wo, which will house our School of Public Health, will open later this year. In the following pages, you can read about the accelerated progress of the BioPark, meet our visionary new deans, and learn about the exciting research and innovative programs at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. As we enter the first year of ourfive-year bicentennial celebration, I invite you to celebrate along with us all that we have accomplished and will accomplish well into the future. Sincerely, David J. Ramsay, DM, DPhil PresidentCelebrating a Proud History and Dynamic Vision PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE Amid a tower of concrete, steel, brick, and glass, Dean Christian S. Stohler, DMD, DrMedDent,waxes philosophic about the new state-of-the- art University of Maryland Dental School building. As technology has shaped the building and the work that happens inside, the building will also help shape the future of research, teaching, and clinical dental care around the world. Setting the T rends The new facility encompasses 375,000 square feet, mak- ing it just under the size of Baltimore's World T rade Center. The building cost is $141.7 million, with $120.2 millioncoming from the state and $21.5 coming from private funds raised b ythe University of Maryland, Baltimore. More than just an impressive structure, the building facilitates increased interaction among faculty, staff, and students. \"This building has become the trendsetter for all the others that are being built,\" Stohler says. And if another dental school has something of interest to Maryland students, lessonsand techniques can be beamed in. \" The ne wbuilding is a platform that is independent of space,\" says Stohler. The Dental School building, which opened in early September 2006, and its technology ar ecertainly impressive. Aboveaground floor with classr ooms and services, there are nine additional levels of clinical and research space topped by a soaring mechanical penthouse that can be illuminated\u2014lantern style\u2014in the West Baltimore sky. Steel panels on the sides and atop the building r eflect southern light into a central atrium. There are 324 patient-care stations where Maryland residents, many of whom cannot afford dentalcare elsewhere, are treated with the most modern medicalequipment av ailable. People with conditions such as HIV or a developmental disability can have their oral health care needs met safely andsecurely in special patient care areas. And should a health crisis that affects many people arise, the building can be used as an emergency treatment center. T raining With the Latest T echnology School officials were pleasantly surprised when the Finnish company P lanmeca won a competition to customiz e and outfit the School's dental stations with an $8.4 million bid, significantly below the Dental School's estimate. And Nobel Biocare, a Swiss company with offices around the world, is pr oviding the technology for students to make dental implants with far greater precision and in far less time than traditional methods. The dental clinic 'sequipment is mor eup to date thanequipment used in most private dental offices today. When graduates enter the dental profession, many will be working with earlier-generation technology. But Stohler predicts that this will change as the graduates push for state-of-the-art equipment in their workplaces. \"That's exactly what Bill Gates says: 'Obsolescence drives the market,'\" says Stohler. In the Dental School's classrooms, clinical stations, and labs, information can be instantly computerized and analyzed. Under direct faculty supervision, students learn how to conduct an examination just as a fully trained dentist would.And by working on lifelike human heads that are positioned just as patients' heads would be positioned during an exam, students gain proficiency in work areas that more closelyresemble real clinical care stations. When a student is ready to work on patients\u2014still under direct faculty supervision\u2014the transition is easier because the student has trained with the same equipment under sim- ilar cir cumstances. Stohler compares it to a pilot learning on arealistic simulator before getting into an airplane\u2014and eventually flying solo. \"It's bringing instruction to a higherlevel,\" he says. On the building's upper floors, Dental School researchers work in spaces built to their specifications as they conductinvestigations in areas ranging from neuroscience to molecu- lar and cell biology studies and infectious diseases and immunology .Recent adv ances in the understanding of pain, for example, hav ecome fr om D ental School r esearchers. Along with the enhanced physical presence that the new Dental School building brings, the possibilities that a new generation of technology-savvy students will bring to theSchool energizes the dean. He anticipates nothing less than a newparadigm in ho wstudents will shape the School. \" These students are our partners now.\" The transition from the School's 41-year-old building, which would have needed $60 million in renovations just to bring it into compliance with building codes, did not comewithout some discomfort. The move forced department chairs and faculty to assess what would be impor tant\u2014and what would be de-emphasiz ed\u2014as the School mo ves forward, Stohler says. That process created \"a wonderful opportunity ... to re-engineer the institution,\" he says. Building Private Support The dean and Dental School administrators watched private financial support grow substantially as the building,which was in the planning stages for nearly a decade, moved closer to its opening. \"When you project a new line for dentistry, anewpath, people want to be a part of it,\" says Stohler.

I n2006-2007, second-y ear dental student Anna Muench is doing just that. Named as a 2006 H oward Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) R esearch Training Fellow, Muench is taking a break from her academic routine to hone her research skills. The coveted fellowships, which are almost exclusively awarded to medical students, include a $25,000 stipend to suppor tfull-time training in fundamental biomedical research. With its mission of enhancing science education and integrat- ing medicine into biomedical research training, HHMI has awarded more than $1 billion in grants since 1988. \"It's an incredible honor,\" says Muench. \"I do feel a special sense of pride being a dental student and receiving this award. Iam thankful for the strong research influence at the Dental School, which has provided me with the opportunity to conductmy HHMI research project here under the direction of Mark Shirtliff, PhD.\" Shirtliff is an assistant professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences in the Dental School. Research results from the talented dental student already have been published in Neuroscience. Her curr ent research, \"D etermination of the Phenotypic Effect of Mutation in Genes Shown to be Up-regulated in Staphylococcus aur eusBiofilms,\" examines the up-regulation of genes that cause the development of biofilm\u2014 athin layer of cells, usually micro-organisms\u2014that can coat a surface and cause infection on implants and medical devices. \"I am hoping to identify the genes r esponsible for biofilm formation that affect biofilm viability and could possibly act as targets for antimicr obial and antibiofilm r emoval strategies,\" Muench says. Her investigations have the potential to lead to new thera- peutic targets for r emoval of biofilm infections, par ticularlythose occurring in the mouth, says R onald D ubner ,DDS, PhD, pr ofessor and chair of the D epartment of B iomedical Sciences. Many chronic infections are caused by biofilms, which are resistant to removal by the host immune system and can onlybe eliminated by surgical removal of dead tissue, notes Dubner. Dean Christian S. Stohler, DMD, DrMedDent, describes Muench as a \"rare, remarkable student. She not only appreci-ates modern science and biotechnology ,but she also demonstrates aunique ability to project the impact of scientific trends on the future of dentistry.\" The goal of the HHMI fellowships is to strengthen and expand the nation's pool of medically and dentally trained researchers. According to HHMI Program Officer Anh-Chi Le, PhD, 66 fellowship awards were given to researchers enrolled in a U.S. medical or dental school. \" This is the first y ear w e have made awards to two of the three dental student applicants,\" says Le. Muench also participated in the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research Short-term Research Training P rogram in 2005 and 2006. H er 2005 pr oject involved the genetic knockouts of a biofilm-producing strain of bacteria that causes chronic infection. A genetic knockout is an organism in which the genetic material has been alter ed by site- directed r ecombination so that the gene is deleted. \"Anna was able to enter the lab and assume complete responsibility and independence in the pr oject, all with absolute success,\" says Shirtliff. In May 2007, fellows will convene at HHMI headquarters in Chevy Chase, M d., for an awar ds cer emony and to pr esent their research. Muench plans to resume her studies at the Dental School in fall 2007 and graduate with the Class of 2009. /boxopen Research Year Yields Practical Results, Personal Honors BY REGINA LAVETTE DAVIS 4 UNIVERSITY O FMAR YLAND ANNA MUENCH DENTAL SCHOOL Wilhelma \"Billie\" Garner-Brown, MEd, an administrator with the school since 1980. \"It took me completely by surprise,\" says Garner- Brown. \"I feel honored and grateful that the students thought of me, and that what I wanted to accomplish for them here has been achieved.\" Official Dedication The Dental School hosted an official dedication of the new building Oct. 24, during a weeklong celebration thatincluded the dean 'sState-of-the-School Address and the Hayden-Harris Associates Gala.

Known as the \"widow maker,\" the LAD is one of the main arteries supplying the hear t. The \" gold standard\" treatment is an operation to re-route the blood supply ar ound blocked ar teries to restore perfusion to oxygen-starved heart muscle, a procedure known as coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. About 500,000 CABG pr ocedur es areperformed ev eryyear in the United States. Tantulo worked in hospitals during his training as a chaplain, and the 60-year-old Middletown, Conn., resident knew that he had to carefully consider his treatment options. \"I wanted to do the least invasive, least traumatic thing to my body,\" Tantulo says. He wanted to avoid the chest soreness of open-heart surgery if possible. More impor- tant, as a survivor of blood cancer, he wanted to avoid the risks of the heart bypass machine that is used to suppor tthe patient during open CABG surger y. Instead, Tantulo was interested in a relatively new and unusual procedure known as minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB). The operation is done through small incisions betw een the ribs, eliminating the discomfor tof cracking the chest. And it is done \"off-pump,\" without the bypass machine, while the heart is still beating. Minimally Invasive Surgery Techniques Reduce Risk for Heart Patients BY BRUCE GOLDFARB Cardiac surgeon Robert Poston (second from right) adjusts the camera angle during robot-assisted coronary artery bypass surgery.Keyhole Surgery At the University of Maryland School of Medicine (SOM) clinical faculty practice within the University of Maryland Medical Center (UMMC), where doctors and surgeons aredevising better ways of doing heart surgery. \"The thing about heart surgery is that you don't get a second chance. It's pretty precious stuff,\" says Robert Poston, MD, assistant professor ofsurgery in the School of Medicine and cardiac surgeon at the medical center. \"We have a number of programs focused on minimizing incisions and doing things through smaller and smaller holes,\"says Poston. \"We're making a major part of our plan for the future focused on minimally invasive surgery.\" In the lab, Poston and his colleagues are working on the next wave of care\u2014futuristic emerging technologies that pushthe limits of minimally invasive surgery to ever smaller and moreprecise scales. Aunique collaboration between cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists is leading to treatment options for people with coronary artery disease\u2014and other diseases of theheart and blood vessels\u2014that are safer, more effective, and more comfortable than traditional approaches. Newer alternativ es to CABG include per cutaneous trans - luminal coronary angioplasty (PCTA). While the patient is sedated in the cardiac catheterization lab, a thin catheter isthreaded thr ough a leg vein into the heart. When placed within the cor onaryartery,aballoon is inflated to widen the blood vessel and restore circulation to oxygen-deprived heart muscle. Other percutaneous methods to restore circulation in coronary arteries include removing blockages with a laser or small cutting tool or inser ting a tiny wire-mesh tube called a stent. Newer models of \"drug-eluting\" stents are coated withmedication to keep vessels from becoming blocked again. The MIDCAB \"keyhole \"surger yhas been performed on more than two dozen patients, including Tantulo, by surgeons on the School of Medicine faculty. Working withminiaturized instruments through an incision only three to four inches wide, the surgeon mo ves the left internal mam- mary artery\u2014one of several large blood vessels inside the chest\u2014so that it feeds into the cor onarycirculation. Performing the surgery while the heart is still beating also eliminates the risks of using a heart-lung machine. A small but significant number of patients experience lingering effects from the heart-lung machine that include the formation ofsmall clots that can affect the brain, kidneys, or lungs. \"Regular open-heart surgery is a morbid operation that involves cooling the body and stopping the heart,\" explains Poston. \"Instead of shutting down the whole circulatory system, the MIDCAB operation can be done without a heart-lung machine.\" Still considered investigational, MIDCAB can be used to restorecirculation to the left anterior descending ar tery, which is the main blood vessel supplying the left side of the T op: Robert Poston manipulates the arms of the da Vinci S Surgical System robot through a computer -controlled console in the operating room. He can monitor his actions through a video monitor. The device filters the surgeon's hand tremors and \"scales down\" large movement tothe more precise actions required for a minimally invasive procedure. Bottom: Laparoscopic screen as viewed from the computer console video monitor, showing the position of robotic surgical instruments during surgeryheart. A second blood vessel can often be bypassed by re-routing the right internal mammary artery from the other side of thechest. \"The left mammary graft is superior to other bypass procedures, and perhaps better than drug-eluting stents,\" says cardiologist Barry Reicher, MD, assistant professor of medi- cine at the School of Medicine and cardiac catheterizationspecialist at UMMC. The MIDCAB procedure \"is very promising,\" he says. \"Despite the benefits of drug-elutingstents, they are not the Holy Grail.\" Tantulo was walking within 10 hours of undergoing sur- gery. Unlike patients who can expect weeks of soreness and recuperation from open-heart surgery, patients who undergoaminimally invasive procedure are often back to their normal daily routine within a day or two. \"I felt great,\" he says. \"It was a wonderful experience.\" Hybrid Procedure Patients with multiple blocked coronary arteries can receive an innovative \"hybrid\" procedure that combines MIDCAB with a stent to keep narrowed heart arteries open. Once the cardiac surgeon completes the bypass part of the surger y,the inter ventional cardiologist then inserts a stent. The hybrid pr ocedur eresults in \"less morbidity ,less pain, less recovery time, less blood loss, and shorter intensive care unit stays,\" says Reicher. \"This gives the patients the best ofboth worlds.\" In order to perform the hybrid surgery, an operating room is equipped with fluoroscopic imaging technology and otherequipment typically found in the car diac catheterization labo - ratory. \"It's the operating room of the future, with a cath lab built right in,\" Poston says. The operating room facility is also used to repair aortic aneurisms, a dangerous thinning of the main artery as it leaves the top of the hear t. The car diac surgeon r eplaces the damaged blood vessel with durable synthetic material, and the interventional cardiologist makes the connections to the carotid arteries that deliver blood to the head and neck. Aminimally invasive approach is used to repair the mitral valve, the in-flow valve for the left side of the heart, which can become narr owed or leaky. About 250,000 people a year develop a leaky mitral v alve, which, if left unchecked, can lead to an enlarged heart and heart failure. Typically tr eated thr ough open-hear tsurger y,University of Maryland physicians perform about 90 percent of mitral valve repairs through a small incision in the patient's armpit. Aminiaturized camera is slipped through tubes into the chest cavity, and the surgeon performs the operation through smallincisions while watching on a video monitor\u2014similar to working the contr ols of a video game. However, doing minimally invasive surgery takes more than fine motor skills. Minimally invasive surgery requires a higher lev el of exper tise and a solid foundation in traditional surgical technique. \"One of our great challenges is to train the next genera- 8 UNIVERSITY O FMAR YLAND ,BALTIMORE PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARC LA YTAR, UMMC (TOP); ED BENNETT , UMMC (BOTTOM) 2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 9tion of surgeons to use these techniques,\" says Poston. \"Patients are demanding smaller incisions, but our trainees still need to learn the fundamentals. To do it well, you need tohave that foundation. If you don't see it big, then seeing it small won't have any relevance. Looking at the screen doesn't give you all the perspective you need.\" Knifeless Surgery The partnership between cardiac surgery and interventional cardiology is helping develop new percutaneous procedures that are replacing procedures customarily done through open- heart surgery. \"We've revolutionized how we treat patients,\" says Reicher. \"A lot of 'first-in-humans' stuff is going on now.\" School of M edicine researchers also are testing the devel- opment of a replacement mitral valve that doesn't require open-heart surgery. Composed of plastic or engineered tissue, the replacement valve is folded until it is a diameter smallerthan a pencil. Using fluoroscopy, the interventional cardiolo- gist guides the valve into the heart through a catheter threaded in a leg vein. Once in place, the valve is \"deployed in a way that the natural valve is pushed aside and the new one fitssnugly in its place,\" says P oston. Human trials with per cutaneous mitral valve repair may begin in the near futur e, according to Reicher. Although the replacement v alves are probably not as durable as conventional valves in use today, the fact that they are less traumaticto install makes the procedure availablefor a gr eater number of patients. Percutaneous heart valve repair is \"particularly well suited for patients whoaretoo sick for traditional open-hear t surger y,or who are unable to go onto a heart-lung machine because of har dening of the arteries or advanced age,\" explains Poston. Another innovative University of Maryland project is testing aminiaturized pump that can be installed percutaneously in cases of heart failure. About 2.5 inches long and also no thicker than a pencil, the high-performance pump\u2014known as a ven-tricular assist device\u2014helps push blood through the circulatory system, taking some of the load off of the hear tand giving it a better chance of healing. I nmany cases, the r est is enough to avoid risky heart transplantation. Researchers w erecontracted to help design a per cutaneous ventricular assist device intended for use in children, but \"there's enough flow in this pump that it could be used on adults,\" says P oston. Early tests with the ventricular assist device show great promise, says Poston, who predicts that doctors will use the minimally invasive pumps in earlier stages of heart failure. The experience gained b yUniversity of Maryland cardiac surgeons and interventional cardiologists serves in turn toattract companies and laboratories interested in developing or improving their products. \"Having very sophisticated fluoroscopic imaging technology in the operating room puts us in a fast-forward position toattract manufacturers,\" says Poston. \"Our surgeons are at the leading edge of receiving this technology. The fact that we have been selected by the forward-looking companies thatdevelop this technology is a credit to the surgeons.\" School of Medicine health professionals are not only devel- oping and testing new technology, but also bringing innova-tion from the laboratory to the patient's bedside. Techniques that seem like science fiction today will soon become routine in clinical practice. \"We see a day when percutaneous valve replacement will be part of what we do routinely,\" says Poston. Robotic Surgery Poston and his colleagues moved from science fiction to operating-room reality last September with the acquisition by UMMC of a surgical robot. The first robot-assisted bypass surgery was performed at UMMC on Sept. 27, 2006. The da Vinci surgical r obot takes minimally inv asivesurger yto a level of precision that is literally beyond human capabilities. While the surgeon operates controls at a console, a computer filters out hand tremor and \"scales down\" the movement, so that a large motion of the fingers is translated to a small motion of the instr uments while they are inside the patient. All of the motions of the surgeon 'shands and fingers are executed on a small scale. Made b yIntuitiv eSurgical, the $1.3 million da Vinci sur- gical robot was approved in 2000 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for minimally invasive surgery. Robotic surgical techniques are being developed for general surgery, gynecologic surgery, urologic surgery, and cardiac surgery. The da Vinci surgical robot ushers in a new era of improvement in surgical techniques\u2014even smaller incisions with ev en less risk\u2014for cardiac surgery patients. Through their focus on minimally invasive surgery and emerging tech- nologies, P oston and his colleagues will keep impr oving the safety and comfort of heart patients like Thomas Tantulo. /boxopenT op: Prior to surgery, the surgical team positions the arms of the surgical robot over the patient.

An expert on the mechanismof diabetes-induced birth defects, Reece pioneered the discoveryof the dominant biochemical and molecular mechanisms under - lying the causes of these birth defects, as well as methods to prevent these anomalies. The new dean recently shared his thoughts with Maryland magazine. growat its curr ent pace. This is a v eryaustere time in regard to NIH funding, but that doesn't mean that we can't continue to grow. It requires some creative initiatives to continue on our current path. I would also like to see our clinical areas become stronger and will be looking for opportunities to create magnetprograms and centers of clinical excellence. How does having an MBA impact your management style? It influences my approach to management by making me much more analytic when evaluating new or existing ventures. Ido more business and market analysis, return on investment, and business plans to confirm my intuition and to give megreater confidence in initiating and/or staying with projects. How do you stay connected to faculty, staff, and students? Ibelieve in various communications strategies, including a newsletter that features a dean's message. I encourage faculty, staff, and students to submit information about their academic and clinical life. I hav ean open-door policy ,and to the extent possible, I tr yto make time to meet with any faculty ,staff member, or student who wants to see me. My leadership style is characteriz ed byfostering the collegial atmospher ethat is the hallmark of successful academic institutions. I set ambitious yet realistic goals, and motivate and encourage faculty to work collaboratively to achieve those goals. /boxopenWhat attracted you to the University of Mar yland School of Medicine? The School of Medicine has demonstrated an impressive growth profile in its mission areas, especially research. I recognized there was scope, not only to further propel the research and academic progress, but also to signifi- cantly enhance the clinical enterprise. How has your background prepared you for the position? Myformal education is in medicine, r esearch, and business. Ihave had extensive experience in both urban and suburban environments in administration, clinical care, research, and medical education. In addition, I have maintained a personal currency in those key areas, which has allowed me to stay in touch with people's attitudes. I'm also involved in many national organizations that help to shape the nation 'shealth and science policy, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Institute of Medicine, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and other national organizations such as the March of Dimes and the Veterans Administration. What is one of the first issues you will tackle as dean? One of my first goals is to work with medical school leadership to consolidate a vision plan and communicate it across theSchool of M edicine. This inv olves creating strategies and investments to ensur ethat our r esearch enterprise continues to School of Medicine Enters the \"Reece\" Era QA&30th DEAN FOCUSES ON BOOSTING RESEARCH AND BUILDING ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL ENTERPRISE InNovember 2005, a nitration unit at a chemical factory in Jilin, China, exploded. The blast killed six people and injured dozens of others. In the wake of the explosion, an 80-kilometer-long toxic slick of benz ene\u2014a chemical that has been linked with leukemia\u2014 formed on the S onghua River. The slick moved down the river, running past the regional capital of Harbin and its thr ee million residents. Poor communication, inadequate containment efforts, and a four-day shutoff of the water supply\u2014initially with no explanation\u2014led to panic and mass evacua- tion. As the benz ene wound its way along the riv er towardthe Russian border, China found itself facing a major international incident. Into this highly charged environment stepped Robert Percival, JD, MA, director of the University of Maryland School of Law's Environmental Law Program (ELP). Percival joined forces with Miranda Schreurs, PhD, an affil- iate associate pr ofessor at the law school and associate professor in the D epartment of Government and Politics at the University of M aryland, College P ark. Percival and Schreurs made an emergency presentation to a task force reporting to Chinese officials that helped to convince China 'sgovernment to establish its own national reporting requirements for chemical spills and spend more than $1 billion to decontaminate the Songhua River. Percival and Schr eurs co-teach a multidisciplinar yseminar on comparative environmental law and politics with students participating simultaneously in Baltimore and College Parkthrough videoconference\u2014an innovation that won them the 2005 Board of Regents Faculty Award in the Collaboration in Teaching category. The episode illustrates the vital r ole that environmental law experts can play in addressing increased threats to the environ- ment and public health that accompany unprecedented indus- trial and urban growth throughout the world. National Experts at the Helm Established in 1987, the Environmental Law Program was among the first programs for environmental law education in the U nited S tates. It is also among the most heralded\u2014the ELP is consistently named as a top program in U.S.News and World Report' sannual graduate school rankings. It placed fourth in the most r ecent edition. Today, virtually all major U.S. law schools have environ- mental law pr ograms, but a global worldvie wand a spirit of inventiveness have helped to keep the School of Law's program at the forefront. No doubt, it is Percival's own reputation as an internation- ally recognized scholar in environmental law that also has made the program so well respected. He came to the School of Law in 1987 and has been with the ELP since its inception.

As the Natural Resour ces Law I nstitute D istinguished Visitor at Le wis & Clark College School of Law and a visiting professor of law at the University of Chile, Percival helped establish South America'sfirst envir onmental law clinic. Location is Key Percival notes that the University's Baltimore location\u2014 only a shor tdrive from the nation's capital, and close to the Chesapeake Bay\u2014has contributed to the program's success. Theprogram's leaders and students learned early on to balance envi-ronmental inter ests with a strong understanding of the way national policy is developed. \"We have done a great job of taking advantage of our prox- imity to Washington, D.C., as well as to the Chesapeake Bay,\" says P ercival. \"Our location enables us to give students hands- on experience working on environmental policy issues at the local, state, and national lev els.\" This viewpoint has kept the School in tune with the insti- tutions that help drive policy in the U.S. Recently, the School of Law hosted an American B ar Association national confer ence on the environment that brought together prominent professors, attorneys, industry leaders, and others involved in environmental issues, including Bruce Babbitt, former secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. The purpose of the conference\u2014to discuss how creators of environmental law and policy use science to better understand the relationship betw een ecosystems and infrastr uctur e\u2014took a page right out of the new book, Rescuing Science From Politics: Regulation and the Distor tion of Scientific R esearch,co-edited b y Rena Steinzor, JD, the Jacob A. France Research Professor ofLaw and dir ector of the ELP's Environmental Law Clinic. The book debuts chapters fr om leading academics in law ,science, and philosophy, and forcefully argues the importance of inde- pendent scientific research, free from the influence of politics. Steinzor is a pioneer in environmental law who founded and continues to be a member scholar of the Center for P rogressive Reform\u2014a vir tual think tank composed of national scholars aiming to pr eservethe life and health of human beings and the natural environment. As a partner at Spiegel & McDiarmid, a Washington, D.C., law firm specializing in the r epresentation of state and local gov- ernment entities in the energy and envir onmental ar eas, Steinzor was in charge of the firm's environmental practice. Prior to that,she was counsel to the congressional subcommittee that consid- ered the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 and the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act of 1986. Nurturing Environmental Leaders and Advocates Students of envir onmental law need to be keenly awar eof the world of science, how environmental legislation and policies are created, and how to work with the public. Through the Environmental Law Clinic, students work on actual lawsuits and learn skills such as negotiating with legislators and regulators,and methods of gathering and publicizing environmental data from scientists, and teaching citizens groups to be more effective. \"The clinic is far more intensive than others offered in the country. Our students have argued before the District of Columbia Cour tof Appeals, as well as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which is one step below the U.S. S upreme Cour t,\" Steinzor says. \"They have helped draft legislation and pr epared reports on envir onmental cases her ein the state of Maryland, as well as represented citizens from the city of B altimor e.\" In addition to the Environmental Law Clinic, the ELP has developed the University's innovative Interdisciplinary Program in Environmental Law and Science. The program fosters anunderstanding of environmental law that is grounded in a firm knowledge of the underlying science. As part of the program, Steinzor and Katherine Squibb, PhD, head of the Division of Environmental Epidemiology and Toxicology in the Departmentof Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine in the School ofMedicine, teach courses in regulatory risk assessment and critical issues in environmental law and science. In another innovation, the Maryland Environmental Law Society (MELS), the student society of the ELP , has raisedfunds to participate in the Environmental Protection Agency's annual auction of emissions rights for the past 12 years. The students buy the rights to as many tons of pollution emissions as they can afford, and then \"retire\" them from the system,blocking industry's access. MELS was the first student group to take this action, and many others have followed its lead. The law school has been highly effectiv ein placing its alumni in key positions in the burgeoning envir onmental law field, both as advisers to corporations and in policymaking posts in state and federal government. Alumni have recruited fellowgraduates for jobs too\u2014a key reason that ELP students have a 97 percent employment rate nine months after graduating, according to U.S.News & World Report . All of this has helped position the School and its alumni to participate in national discussions on the environment. Increasingly,those discussions are becoming international as well. Green Gone Global Percival says environmental law has changed significantly since most of the federal laws were adopted in the 1970s. \"What's driving the field now is the growing level of interest in the international arena,\" he says. \"The U.S. has lost some of the political leadership on this issue during the current adminis- tration, while other nations are becoming highly focused onenvironmental concerns.\" Percival has been active in communicating with his environ- mental law counterpar ts in other countries and bringing their perspectives to the University of Maryland. In March 2005, well befor ethe incident in J ilin, P ercival was invited to lecture at law schools in China. During the trip, he met with Wang Canfa, China's top public interest environmental lawyer, and the two agreed on an agenda for future collaboration. As a result of their efforts, the University has hosted visiting Chinese professors including Renmin University of China's Li Yanfang, PhD, one of China's top environmental law professors. InNovember 2005, Percival spoke before the Environmental and Resources Protection Committee of China's NationalPeople's Congress during the International Forum on Environmental Legislation and Sustainable Development. China is a high profile example of a nation trying to come to grips with its environmental concerns. But Percival pointsout that environmental interest and legislative commitment is strong in many areas of the world, including Europe and India. In an effort to facilitate dialogue between nations, the School of Law has hosted international symposiums, bringing together experts from many parts of the world to share infor- mation and debate issues. In April 2007, as part of ELP's 20th anniversary celebration, the School will hold a global symposium for leaders of developing environmental law clinics\u2014the action arms of many environmental law programs. Capturing an Environmental Audience \"We want our students to hit the ground running on the environmental issues of the day,\" says Percival. \"To be an effec- tiveleader in this field, it isn 'tenough to have the law on your side. You also have to be able to reach into, and influence, public opinion. It is critical that we help students address thechallenge of translating complex environmental issues into understandable language.\" Tothat end, ELP has cr eated a unique pr ogram in which students make documentar yfilms about envir onmental issues. Some are whimsical, such as \"Lead Muppets,\" which uses a Keanu Reeves cutout and sound-alike to present the problem of lead poisoning in B altimor e's inner city. Other films are more sober, including \"Perchlorate,\" a piece that examines chemicalcontamination from Maryland's military testing sites. Percival says effective, creative communication can be as valuable a tool in addr essing environmental law issues as statutes and briefs, especially in today's political climate. \"There has been a puzzling backlash against environmentalism, with some policymakers being activ ely hostile to wardenvironmental concerns,\" he says. Percival attributes the backlash in part to the rapid develop- ment of environmental science and its examination of such broad issues as global warming\u2014issues that can be difficult tounderstand on a local or personal level. The result is a gridlock in envir onmental debates\u2014and outdated laws. If tomorrow's environmental lawyers want to do better, they must facilitatemore effective communication among property owners, busi- nesses, and citiz ens. \"We must rebuild consensus around key environmental issues,\" says P ercival. With its reputation for success and track record of global leadership, the ELP is well positioned to help organize that consensus, making the law school a powerful ally for the envi- ronment\u2014and the people who live in it. /boxopen\"We want our students to hit the ground running on the environmental issues of the day,\" says Percival.

Law school haschanged me. F or the first time in my life, I don't have everything planned out. I'm just keeping an open mind.\" An open mind might be what led Merki to the University of Maryland School of Law. During his senior year at Maurice J. McDonough High School in Charles County, Md., he wasselected b yGov. Parris Glendening to serve as the 2000-01 State Board of Education student member. \"That's probably the most significant experience I've had so far. Without it my life would have been very different.\" It was through his wor konthe boar dthat he met the man he calls his mentor: Walter Sondheim Jr., one of Baltimore's greatest civic leaders and public servants. \"He led the desegregation of Baltimore's public schools after Brown v. Board of Education was handed down, and he helped with the revitalization of downtown Baltimore. We stay in touch and see each other often,\" he says. Following high school, that connection helped Merki win a scholarship to pursue undergraduate studies in Sondheim's name at the U niversity of M aryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). \"My public policy work as an undergraduate set meup to come to this law school,\" he says. Merki also got a taste of what a lawyer's life is like, even before his first class. As a junior at UMBC, he worked in theAppellate D ivision of the M aryland O ffice of the P ublic Defender. He wrote a brief that was accepted by the MarylandCourt of Appeals in a case that resulted in the release of a man from serving several additional years in prison. He describes the case as \"an example of a rural county trial court judge who was completely unsympathetic to the defen-dant\u2014misconstr uing a statute to try and lock him up for an extra five years, I'm proud of this. I hadn't had a day of lawschool, and I wrote 95 percent of it,\" Merki says. Merki chose the U niversity of Maryland because of the friendly people and atmosphere. \"I'm learning practical skills. Alaw degr ee is extr emely useful, whether or not I' mgoing to practice law for the rest of my life.\" Unlike many of his colleagues, Merki is confident that time spent away from the library is time well spent. \"I don't let law school interfere with my social life. I take many weekends offand go out with friends. I hav etwo little godkids who live nearb y,and I see them often. My family is close enough for me to go home and visit.\" As the son of a minister, Merki calls his childhood \"an edu- cation in compassion and r espect for all people.\" H esays that his faith and his belief that all people are equal\u2014regardless of any differences\u2014are what propel him toward a career in equality and social justice. \"Law school is just a small part of a broader means to do big things. I try to put the interests of others before my own,\" says M erki. /boxopenSTUDENT PROFILE AARON MERKI SCHOOL OF LAW PHOTOGRAPHS BY ROBERT BURKE BY LORI ROMERServing Others With Respect and Justice The delivery of health care to patients has changed dramatically in the last 30 years\u2014and nurses arein the national vanguard of providing improve- ments and inno vations in patient care at all levels. As health car edeliverybecomes more high- tech and complex, and as the scope of nursing responsibilities increases, so too has the need for nurses to possess mor e advanced training. To meet this need, and to ease a widespread nursing shortage, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing has created new practice roles to meet the growing need for nurses in the health care system. One new role is that of Clinical Nurse Leader (CNL). The CNL is an entry-level nurse educated at the master's degree level to provide quality care at the bedside. As members of the interdisciplinary health care team, they will oversee the carecoordination of a gr oup of patients in a par ticular setting such as a hospital, community-based health center, or school. These nurses will work alongside other nurses and membersof the health car eteam to impr ovethe quality and efficiency of patient care. \"They collect and evaluate patient outcomes, put evidence- based practice into action, and facilitate patient care across a wide variety of settings,\" says Carol Esche, DNP , RN, MA,CNA, assistant professor in the School of Nursing and co-director of the School's new CNL program. Gail Schoen Lemaire, PhD, APRN/PMH, BC, assistant professor in the School and co-director of the program, adds: \"They can adjust car eplans when appropriate to improve patient care and will facilitate communication between the patient, family, and members of the health care team.\" Atthe School of N ursing, the Clinical N urse Leader program is designed as a second-degree program for students holding a bachelor's degree in a field other than nursing. Ninety-six nursing schools around the country are also piloting the program, but the University's nursing school is the only one in Maryland to offer a degree in the new nursing role. Students work with faculty to develop their basic nursing skills.

CNL graduates also will be eligible to sit for theCNL cer tification examination. \"I tis expected that mor ehospitals will incorporate the CNL graduate into their organization and that opportunities for graduates will continue to grow,\" saysEsche. \"I'minterested in seeing the Clinical N urse Leader r ole evolve,\" adds Matthews, who anticipates working in medical- surgical nursing. \"I think we will need to get some additionalpractice in nursing before we can be leaders in the field, and that's how it should be,\" he says. Other CNL students plan to leverage their training as a way to gain nursing and leadership experience en route to anadvanced-practice nursing degree. \"I am not cer tain what kind of r ole I will have as a CNL,\" says Gurung, \"but I will definitely be back to school for the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner program.\" Rodl also has decided to become an advanced practice nurse\u2014ev entually .\"My CNL obstetrical clinical rotation was wonderful. I want to be a nurse midwife,\" she says. \"What I will pr obably do no wis wor kfull time in obstetric nursing and go to school part time.\" The role of clinical nurse leader is an exciting one, say Esche and Lemair e, and one that is still ev olving. CNLs will hav ea positive impact on patient care, and on the profession. And in the near future, clinical nurse leaders will be fully integrated into the health care system. The School of N ursing continues to develop innovative educational pathways, such as the Clinical Nurse Leader pro- gram, in or der to impr ove patient care and address important workforce issues in the nursing field. /boxopen\"Our Clinical Nurse Leader graduate program is unique in that applicants enter the program with degrees in non-nursing fields and obtain a generalist education at the master's degreelevel,\" says J anet D. Allan, P hD, RN, CS, F AAN, dean of the School of Nursing. \"This program represents an opportunity for women and men to obtain an advanced degree and movedirectly into patient car e\u2014and ultimately patient care leader- ship r oles,\" adds Allan. Lemaire and Esche say that because the role is so new, its scope is sometimes misunderstood. On the one hand, the CNLprogram is entry level. \"We start with the basics\u2014taking vitalsigns, for instance,\" says Esche. However, after completing the program, CNL students graduate as advanced generalists with a master's degree. \"CNL graduates have advanced education in communication, assessment, case management, and evidence-based practice,\" Esche adds. The leadership role of a CNL differs from that of other nurses. \"CNLs apply evidence to practice in their identified clinical ar ea and will integrate case management into their practice. Their practice and leadership focuses on patients and their care,\" says Lemaire. Students come to the School 'sCNL pr ogram from finance, business, education, science, technology, and other backgrounds. \"The nursing profession will benefit from the problem-solving and critical-thinking skills they bring,\" Lemair esays. \" We utilize the strengths of their individual experience.\" Eva Rodl, a member of the first CNL class that graduated last December, came to the program with an undergraduatedegree in psychology. Rodl liked the field\u2014and even participated in several psychology research projects\u2014but foundthat r esearch did not offer her the daily r eward she was seeking. \"Inpsychology ,you could spend years doing research and maybe have a paper published. I wanted an accomplishmentthat I could put my hands on, so to speak. Nursing is practical. You get rewarded and have some success with your patients every day,\" Rodl says. William \"R usty\"Matthews, V, is a member of the second CNL class and is slated to graduate in May 2007. Like Rodl, he entered the program with an undergraduate psychology degree.However, Matthews spent the previous three years working as apsychiatric technician at Sheppard and Enoch Pratt Hospital in Towson, Md. His duties in the Adult Inpatient Psychotic Disorders Unit included running group therapy sessions, completing documentation, and managing patient behavior. \"My original career plan was to become a clinical psycholo- gist,\" he says, \"but at S heppar dPratt, I worked under the nurses. They have so much more contact with patients, and it makes such a differ ence. N urses ar eon the fr ont lines 24-7, and the psychologists and psychiatrists see the patients for, maybe, 40 minutes at a time,\" he says. \"I decided I'd rather be in nursing.\" Arati Gurung, who graduated from the program last December, has a bachelor's degree in computer science andengineering. S he worked briefly in information technology but didn't like the field enough to stay in it. Instead, she decided to pursue her longtime inter est in health science. \"M ycareer change is a big switch, but I am thoroughly enjoying my nursing experience so far ,\" she says. The 64-credit CNL program includes essential clinical rota- tions (including adult health, pediatrics, mental health, obstetrics, and community health) and didactic coursework, along with a final clinical immersion experience of approximately 300 hours.The University of Maryland Medical Center is the clinical partner for the School's CNL pilot program, providing training oppor tunities and a plan to integrate the CNL graduates into its system of care. After graduating fr om the CNL pr ogram, graduates ar eNew Program Offers Nurses aPractice-FocusedDoctorate Aclinically based or \"practice\" doctorate has been a standard credential among health care providersfor years. Physicians earn the MD. Pharmacists earn the PharmD. Physical therapists earn the DPT, and dentists earn the DDS. Until recently, nurses who wanted doctorates in nursing could choose the PhD or a similar Doctor of Nursing Science (DNSc) option. The PhD and DNSc were ideal fornurses who wanted to conduct r esearch, but nurses who sought a practice-oriented doctorate faced an academic v oid, because, for nurses at least, no such degree existed. Last fall, however, the University of Maryland School of Nursing inaugurated its Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) program, the only such pr ogram in Maryland. The DNP is anewnon-r esearch, practice doctorate designed and sup - ported b ythe American Association of Colleges of N ursing. It is a doctorate for nurses who do not wish to be researchers, but who want to advance the practice of nursing and alsohave the option of teaching. \"Bynursing ' practice,' w emean practice br oadly defined\u2014either clinically focused, or in nursing administra- tion, or as a nurse educator or nurse informatician,\" says Patricia Gonce Morton, PhD, RN, ACNP , FAAN, interim associate dean for master's studies and director of the DNP program. The School's DNP program is one of 22 such programs in the U.S., but it is the first in Maryland. \"The DNP is a unique oppor tunity for nurses,\" Morton says. \"We've had many program applicants say, 'I've waited for this for a long time. This is what I dr eamed nursing would one day offer.'\" The DNP will not only raise the academic bar for senior-level nurses, it will also help decrease the shortage of nursing faculty. \"The DNP responds to the current andfuture needs of the American health care system and to the educational demands of nurse educators, nurse administra- tors, nurse informaticians, and adv anced practice nurses,\" says School of Nursing Dean Janet D. Allan, PhD, RN, CS, F AAN. DNP candidates range in age from their late 20s to 60 years old, and all hav eat least a master 'sdegree in nursing, \"Nursing is practical.

The parents of two sons, ages 12 and 7, and a 5-year-old daughter, the Baileys have nearly completed their graduate program require-ments for the master's degree from the University of Maryland School of Nursing. Howdo parents who work full time and raise an active trio manage the added responsibility of graduate school? The Baileys arethe first to admit it is a juggling act of sor ts, but one that has worked quite effectively for them. Creative scheduling, supportive employers, the helping hands of their own kids, and sticking to a r outine make it possible, they say . \"I do think initially it was kind of overwhelming,\" Felecia admits, \"making sure the kids are where they need to be. It's a whole lot smoother once we get everybody's schedules together. I'm a real planner.\" Both Jeene and Felecia are working toward the Master of Science in Community/P ublic H ealth N ursing. The Baileys believe that an advanced degree would help them achieve more autonomy on the job, more of a voice in the decision-makingprocess, better access to managerial posts, and greater opportunities within community-based nursing\u2014and possibly medical research. The couple chose the University of Maryland School of Nursing program becausethe flexible classroom hours better fit their hectic family schedule. Felecia also liked the traditional classroom setting as compared to an online option. \"I need structure,\" Felecia says. \"The library is right there. Its technology is up to date. Personnel are always available to directme, and the faculty members are really con- cerned about my education and my success.\" Jeene acknowledges that the two working nurses couldn't have pursued their dreamwithout supportive employers who remained flexible about their changing schedules. The Baileys are both active-duty nurse officers ofthe U.S. P ublic H ealth S ervice at the N ational Institutes of H ealth. Their wor khas taken them onto militar y posts and into state prison systems in Virginia and Maryland, and both were working full time when they entered theSchool of N ursing pr ogram in 2002. In addition to sharing a profession, the Baileys also share a similar background. They grew up, met, and married in NorthCarolina. Felecia is a native of Southern Pines, and Jeene grewup in Columbia near the state's Outer Banks. Their paths first crossed in 1998 during their senior year as nursing students atNorth Carolina Central University, and they married three years later. The Baileys long-term plan is to return to the state wheretheir passions for health car ewere first inspired. Felecia describes a trip she made as a child to a hospital to visit a mother and her ne wborn. \" When the nurse br ought the baby in, a light bulb went off: 'That's what I want to do,'\" recalls Felecia. Meanwhile Jeene saw his sister, also a nurse, bombarded with questions from friends and relatives about an assortmentof health concerns. Many people in the rural community had to drive 15 miles to see a physician or nurse for routine care. \"They were just so grateful. I loved it,\" he recalls. \"Now I want to do something where I can help people and really make adiffer ence.\" Jeene and Felecia acknowledge that there have been sacri- fices along the way. But the reward, they say, is that the Bailey family has learned to adapt to change and that when all is said and done, it will have been for a greater purpose. \"We have to improve things\u2014not just for ourselves\u2014but for others as well,\" says Felecia. /boxopen Couple Juggles Graduate Nursing Program With Family Life BY GWEN NEWMANSTUDENT PROFILE FELECIA AND JEENE BAILEY SCHOOL OF NURSING PHOTOGRAPH BY ROBERT BURKEsays Morton. They come from various backgrounds\u2014nurse practitioners, educators, administrators, clinicians\u2014and are already far along in their careers. \"They don't need to earn this degree to advance,\" Morton adds. \"But they want it, so that theycan contribute more to the profession and improve patient care.\" DNP students customize the 38-credit (at minimum) program with the help of a faculty advisor, according to theircareer interests. The doctorate culminates not in a dissertation, but in a capstone project in which students translate an area of research into practice. \"For example, a student might be evaluating models of care, or analyzing patient outcomes from protocols,\" says Morton. \"We want students to graduate as experts in evidence-basedpractice and to bring research findings to their practice setting.\" The first DNP class is impressive, Morton notes. \"The students have exciting ideas. One wants to establish a nurse- managed clinic. Another wants to explore creative modalities innursing education and try to make the process more learner-centered,\" she says. DNP candidate Dionne Mebane Raley, MSN, RN, AE-C, CRNP , a pediatric nurse practitioner and assistant professor at the Helene Fuld School of Nursing at Coppin State University in Baltimore, says her reason for earning the doctorate is multifaceted. \"This is a wonderful opportunity for clinician-scholars to 18 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE PHOTOGRAPH BY ROBERT BURKEearn a terminal degree focused on advancing their clinical skills, and learning to dissect, translate, and implement research\u2014 rather than perform it,\" Raley says. Raley, who also works as a pediatric nurse practitioner at a family practice in Baltimore, is especially interested in pediatric asthma and adolescent gynecology in inner-city populations.Her long-term goal is to direct a pediatric nurse practitioner clinical program while continuing to practice pediatric primary care. \"A DNP will aid me in achieving these goals by combin-ing advanced assessment and management skills with the theoretical, analytical, and business skills necessary to be a clinician-scholar,\" Raley adds. Matthew D'Angelo, MS, CRNA, a nurse anesthetist at the RAdams Cowley Shock T rauma Center, is also enrolled in the DNP program. D'Angelo knew for a long time that he wantedto earn a doctorate. \"Over the years, I have been accepted into several PhD programs\u2014including one in pharmacology andanother in neuroscience\u2014but I did not complete them because they ultimately didn 't give me the clinical practice focus I wanted,\" D'Angelo says. \"The DNP is different. It's a practice doctorate\u2014not bench science. It's a way to work clinically, teach clinically, and conductclinical research.\" D'Angelo, who also is assistant director of the School's nurse anesthesia master's program, is earning his doctor- ate full time. \"I would like to finish assoon as possible,\" he says. But most DNP candidates, Morton notes, wor katafull-time job and attend the pr ogram par ttime. \"I twill take most of them four or five years to complete the degree,\" she says. After graduation,about half of the DNP candidates plan to combine teaching with practice, and the others will pr obably teach, says Morton. \"After coming out of our pro-gram, they will be able to obtain facultypositions anywher e.\" To facilitate the DNP program's success, the Maryland Health ServicesCost Review Commission\u2014the organi- that sets the rates M aryland hospi- tals charge\u2014awarded the School of Nursing a fiv e-year,$1,020,000 grant to support the DNP program, including funds to hire faculty for the program. \"The state initiativ eis unpr ecedented; we hope it will serve as a national model,\" says Allan.

Barth, PhD, MSW, is the seventh dean of the School of S ocial Work. Barth has authored more than 150 peer-r eviewed research papers, written 11 books, and presented expert testimony before the U.S. House of Representativ es\u2014on adoption, child w elfare, and substance abuse\u2014that has helped to create new laws and improve current ones. T wice a Fulbright scholar, Barth has been honored with numerous awards, including the James E. Flynn Prize forResearch from the University of Southern California, and theNational Association of Social Worker's Presidential Award forExcellence in Research. \"I am both proud and thrilled to have been appointed dean of this School, one of the finest schools of social wor kin the country,\" says Barth. Since July, when he arrived in Baltimore from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (UNC), where he was the Frank A. Daniels Professor for Human Services PolicyInformation, Barth has been meeting with faculty, students, and staff to discuss the future of the School and to let them knowthat one of his top priorities will be to raise and allocate funds to \"support faculty who want to try different approaches and do some demonstration projects,\" he says. \"One of the opportunities\u2014and responsibilities\u2014of being in Baltimore is that we can make a real difference in real lives right here.\" Byall accounts, the 54-y ear-old B arth is brilliant, disciplined, and action oriented. A leader in evidence-based r esearch, B arth was co-principal investigator for the National Study of Child and A dolescent Well-Being, the first-ever examination of the countr y'schild welfare system that used a nationally representa- tive sample. He also created a program in California called Shared Family Care, designed to bridge the gap between providing services to parents at home and providing services to their chil- dren by placing both generations in foster care together. The foster parents offer stability and teach mothers how to parent their children while everyone is under the same roof. \"Social workers understand that the only way the world changes is if each of us examines the evidence and our con- sciences to see what changes are needed, and then take the lead,\" he says.

Yet, only one in five of those children receives the mental health services they need. Even fewer African-American children obtain mental health care, even though they are disproportionately exposed to violence, drugs, and alcohol, according to a 2003 report by the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health. Those risk factors place them at a higher risk of developing mental health problems. School of Social Work Assistant Professor Michael Lindsey, PhD, MSW, MPH, knows first- hand about growing up in a difficult and dangerous environment. Raised in a drug-infested andviolent neighborhood in southeast Washington, D.C., he is familiar with the struggles faced byAfrican-American adolescents. \"I once saw a man die in front of my house,\" he says. \"I know people who sold drugs and carried guns every day. I've seen people just struggling to survive and overcome their circumstances.\" To learn how to improve mental health care access for African-American children, Lindsey has been studying why such access is so poor .Hehas examined factors that affect the w ell-being of the children's caregivers, such as the caregiver's mental health, social support system, substance abuse history, and satisfaction with the neighborhood. \"Research has shown that lack of transportation and insurance coverage alone do not2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 23Although Tal Shtulman does not consider herself reli- gious, the 23-year-old dual-degree student does see herself as spiritual\u2014and driven.

Herecently worked on a project that brought together Judah Pearl\u2014the father of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and mur dered in P akistan five years ago\u2014and a Muslim professor for a dialogue to explore their common ground. \"It's gratifying to see that the two men are close now and this is a dialogue that they took all over the world,\" says Shtulman, who like her father, sees herself working on a macrolevel to change just a small piece of the world. \"The whole experience of seeing him bring the two men together before an audience to discussthe current differences between Muslims and Jews is inspiring.\" The first legacy student in the dual-degree program at the School of Social Work and the Friedman Institute, Shtulman chose Maryland'sprogram because it offered a better fit for her than eight similar national programs. \"I felt that this one was the most organized,\" she says,calling the interaction betw een the School of Social Work and the Friedman Institute \"seamless.\" She adds, \"Baltimore itself\u2014with its ethnic mix\u2014appealed to me.\" During her first year in the program in 2005-2006, she earned a 4.0 GPA and received a merit-basedaward for $5,000 from the Rosa J.

She began an early second-year internship last summer at the P earlstone Conference and Retreat Center in Reisterstown, Md. \"The field placement opportunities have given me invalu- able experience so that I can confidently look ahead to my first official job after graduation,\" says Shtulman, who is writing grants and working for the center's educational programs. She describes herself as \"especially interested in hate crimes, the offenders of hate crimes, and human civil rights.\" As a student at Penn State, she organized an AIDS walk that raised morethan $18,000.

His work moves us forward in understand- ing how and why, which will ultimately lead us to developing successful interventions.\" Lindsey says the research shows that social workers must not only attend to the needs of their adult clients but also to the needs of their clients' children. \"Although it may seem obvious that a social worker should be awar eof the children's needs, social work services are more often than not provided in a vacuum of sorts,\" says Lindsey. \"For instance, if a social worker is helping a single mother with depression and substance abuse, the social worker may not be attuned to the needs of the woman's children because the social worker is so focused on the mother's needs.\" Lindsey says hisresearch also ar ticulates the need for social wor kers to educate and train caregivers to identify their children's mental health problems themselv es. Lindsey 'sresearch has included study of how adolescent African-American males perceive mental health services and providers. According to Lindsey, studies show that even whenAfrican-American teens have access to services, they only attend an average of two to three treatment sessions. With funding from the National Institute of Mental Health, Lindsey inter-viewed adolescents who had symptoms of depression. Half were in treatment, half were not. Lindsey says that due to a stigma among African-American teens regarding mental illness, the youths he spoke to soughthelp from their social networks before seeing mental health professionals. The teens also felt that service providers might not understand the experiences of African-American males, andmight stereotype them. They said training and education are not enough\u2014mental health pr ofessionals must also be willing toshare personal experiences or anecdotes during therapy. Understanding some of the barriers to obtaining mental health car eamong African-American adolescents can help social workers and mental health care providers better connectwith the youths, Lindsey says. \"This research helps articulate the factors that are likely to improve access to and engagement in services among a popula-tion that doesn't traditionally use mental health services,\" says Lindsey .Healso hopes that his study r esults eventually help adapt mental health interventions that target African-American youths to make the interventions more effective. \"Research is mor ethan just pr oving or dispr oving theory,\" he says. \"It's about the implications of your research and the lives that may be positively impacted from your work.\" /boxopen 22 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE PHOTOGRAPH BY ROBERT BURKEBY ROSALIA SCALIAexplain the disparity in mental health care among African- Americans,\" Lindsey says. \"There are other factors contributing to poor use of services. Perhaps these children are not getting access to mental health services simply because their caregivers are struggling with their own concerns and cannot recognize that their children have mental health problems.\" Data for Lindsey's research came from hundreds of African- American eight-year-old children and their caregivers who werepart of the Longitudinal Studies of Child Abuse and Neglect, agroup of research studies coordinated by the University ofNorth Carolina and funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect. Lindsey found that when the caregivers did not feel supported socially and had mental health and substance abuse problems of their own, the children in their care were more likely to have elevated mental health needs. If the children's needs are not addressed, they become probable precursors to more serious mental health problems. And because of the caregivers' own dif- ficulties, the childr en's needs were often not met. \"Some studies hav elooked at ho wonly one factor ,such as substance abuse, affects a child, but we were able to look at how many different factors together affect the child,\" Lindsey says.\"Now that we have a composite of the caregivers ... we can study which kids are likely to use mental health services.\" Lindsey worked in collaboration with Donna Harrington, PhD, professor and director of the Ruth H.

The emergency room would be the next log- ical step, but about 80 percent of poison exposures can betreated safely at home. And last y ear,just under 70,000 people in Maryland called the Maryland Poison Center (MPC) in the School of Pharmacy for help with possible poison exposures.The MPC sav es the state millions of dollars in unnecessar y health car ecosts, but mor eimpor tant, it sav es lives. The MPC and the National Capital Poison Center, in Washington, D.C., are the only poison centers servingMaryland. The MPC began providing around-the-clock poison information and emergency assistance to state r esidents and health care professionals in the 1970s. The MPC's mis-sion\u2014to provide up-to-date information to the general publicand health care professionals about potential poisons\u2014hasnot changed since the center mo ved from Baltimore City Hospital to the School of Pharmacy in 1972. What has changed since the MPC began operating from a cramped basement office in the old D unning Hall building is the scope and v olume of ser vices the center provides. Last year, its 10 full-time, nationally certified specialists answered 68,334 calls\u201410 times the v olume that a smaller staff handled in the early '70s\u2014making the MPC a major public health resourcefor the state. Topics of phone calls range fr om intentional dr ug overdoses to adverse reactions to prescription drugs. And with fully auto- mated phone lines and a sophisticated database system, MPC staff can identify and research trends in poisonings. Patterns orgroupings of calls, for instance, could lead staff to identify a bioterrorism threat. People ar ound the state ar etaking note of the center's expanded r ole and what it will take to maintain that r ole. The Maryland General Assembly, which is working to identify sus-tainable funding for the MPC, r ecently or dered a study of itsfunding needs. It has been estimated that approximately $1.8 million in annual funding is required to support the vital healthservice the MPC provides. \"The Maryland Poison Center is a major public health asset to every citizen in Maryland,\" says David A. Knapp, PhD,dean of the School of P harmacy. \"You never know who is going to use it\u2014from a toddler who accidentally got into something\u2014to a person who has done something intentionally.The MPC is ther e24/7.\" Pioneers in P oison Control When the MPC r elocated to the School of P harmacy in 1972, there were five other poison centers scattered in hospitals throughout Maryland. By linking the center with the University's medical and educational r esources, the MPC became the first center to provide around-the-clock poison information andemergency assistance. In those days, few poisoning and over- dose references were available, computers were scarce, and Internet resources were nonexistent. The center's small staff was aided b ypharmacy and medical students who manned the phones on nights and w eekends. But the center flourished, and by 1975, the MPC was expanding its community outr each pr ograms. Mr .Yuk, the scowling green face now easily recognized by both children and adults as a warning for poisonous substances, was introduced by the MPC that year. The center also kicked off a statewide awareness campaign and implemented a toll-free phone line. \"With more public awareness came higher call volumes; poison specialists w erehandling increasingly difficult cases,\" says Lisa Booz e, PharmD, CSP I, the center's clinical coordina- tor. Booze, one of four pharmacists hired in 1979, initially answered calls full time, but her r ole gradually expanded. N ow, Booze provides educational services to health professionals throughout the state. The early 1980s ushered in a national push for more specific guidelines for poison centers. Standards were established requir-ing centers to operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week; to 24 UNIVERSITY O FMAR YLAND ,BALTIMORE 2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 25 ILLUSTRATION BY EMERY PAJERoffer outr each and educational programs; and to staff the phones with health professionals certified as poison information specialists by the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC). With most of those pieces already in place,the MPC was named a certified Regional Poison Center by the AAPCC in 1985. Expanding Outreach and Education Today, the center's outreach efforts are in full force. Angel Bivens, RPh, MBA, CSPI, public education coordinator, travels around the state teaching the public about poison hazar ds.Last year, the MPC presented 59 educational programs to approxi- mately 2,000 health care professionals and firefighters in 15counties and Baltimore city, says Booze. Many paramedical students and emergency medicine r esidents from throughout the state learn poison management from MPC staff members. Fourth-year pharmacy students can spend a month at the center learning about poison exposures as part of their field-work. The MPC has one of only a handful of remaining toxi- cology fellowships in the country. The two-year fellowship in clinical toxicology trains pharmacists to work as toxicologists in poison centers and in to xicology services, and as researchers in academic envir onments. \"The MPC is a pipeline of people who are trained toxicolo- gists to help pr ovide car efor poison patients. The fello wship feeds into the pool of future toxicologists,\" says Bruce Anderson, PharmD, ABAT, the center's director of operations. Anderson is certified b ythe American Boar dof Applied Toxicology . Protecting the Public Throughout its 35-year history at the School of Pharmacy, the MPC has been dir ectly involved in national public health events. During the oil shortage of the mid 1970s, the center received a large number of calls about people who swallo wed gasoline while siphoning gas. The Tylenol tampering scar ein the early 1980s also created a huge spike in calls. Morerecently ,the center 'smedical dir ector, Suzanne Doyon,MD, F called upon b yarea hospitals to inv estigate a worrisome cluster of what seemed like heroin overdoses. She worked with the state medical examiner to determine that fen- tanyl, a str ong nar cotic used to tr eat cancer pain, was being sold on the str eets in some Maryland counties as heroin. These days, the r ole of the MPC staff as state poison experts extends to issues of homeland security. With the threat of anthrax in O ctober 2001, the MPC helped to educate Maryland residents about the agent\u2014what it is, what it lookslike, and what to do in case of an exposure. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the center, in conjunc- tion with the AAPCC, implemented a more sophisticated systemof data collection and analysis, enabling it to identify trends that might indicate a bioterrorism release, says Anderson. \"If someone releases anthrax today\u2014if we're seeing weird skin reactions or if people get breathing reactions or symptoms that look like pneumonia\u2014w ehavemonitors that can pick that up,\" explains Anderson. \"We can provide another mechanism to help identify possible terrorist releases quickly.\" Inkeeping with its educational mission, the MPC is also helping to educate health care professionals, including pharma-cists, about their role in bioterrorism preparedness with a series of lectures and online materials. MPC's evolution is an outgrowth of the core service it has been providing since its start, says Anderson. \"That service\u2014 providing around-the-clock poison information and emergency assistance\u2014allows us to look at new opportunities and do new things to meet the needs of the citiz ens of this state.\" /boxopenNumber of calls 2005Maryland ROBYN FIESERMaryland Everyone's Resource2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 27 [1807 ] CREATING A VISION FOR THE FUTURE T wo hundred years ago, a group of Baltimore physicians decided to form a school of medicine based on the rigorous curricula learned at various institutions in Europe. These visionaries struggled against myriad odds to build the foundation of what ev entually became the U niversity of Maryland, Baltimore. From its storied and sometimes controversial beginnings, the School of Medicine has evolved into a campus with seven professional schools and a graduate school serving the health sciences and human services professions. Itis the founding campus of what has no wbecome the U niversity S ystem of Maryland with 11 degr ee-granting institutions and two r esearch institutions. BicentennialWhile she was a pharmacy student at the U niversity of Kansas, D anielle Chauncey Lav allee explor ed a variety of career paths. She worked at an ambulatory care center with the Indian Health Service of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, spent time at a hospital-run diabetes clinic, and worked in a community pharmacy. Those choices revealed her passion for working directly with patients. But while her fellow students were busy deciding ontheir car eer paths, Lav allee was left with a nagging question: What is the best way to apply data collection and research\u2014 an area she was also passionate about\u2014to patient care? \"We can say we're going to implement something, but if you just do it and don't evaluate something, how do you know it works?\" asks Lavallee. Her curiosity ,and a 2002 conv ersation with C. D aniel Mullins, PhD, professor and chair of the Department of Pharmaceutical Health Services Research in the School of Pharmacy ,piqued her inter est in the U niversity of M aryland. Mullins told Lavallee that the best health service is aimed at improving clinical practice. That conversation, Mullins' \"phenomenal energy,\" and the quality of the School of Pharmacy faculty brought her toBaltimore in 2003 to pursue her doctorate in what Mullinsdescribes as \"inno vativeresearch that investigates the unrecog- nized communication gap betw een health car eproviders and their patients.\" Specifically ,Lavallee is examining ho wapatient 'sknowledge and beliefs about the anticoagulation drug that patient is takingmight affect the treatment outcome. \"The question I'm asking is: If pharmacists have access to information about their patients as people, can they controltheir INR [International Normalized Ratio, a standardized test that measur es blood-clotting time] and better educate patients?\" she says. The idea caught the attention of the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which awarded her a post- doctoral traineeship award grant to complete her dissertation. Lavallee has enlisted 160 patients who are currently taking the anticoagulation drug Coumadin \u00ae,adrug used to prevent clotting and strokes, and who are also enrolled in an anticoagu-lation clinic. The patients will be asked about topics not normally associated with anticoagulation clinics, such as their general health literacy and their thoughts about taking the drug. Information collected from the control group of 80 patients will be withheld, while information collected fr om the inter - vention group of 80 patients will be summarized and given to the pharmacists who work with those patients. \"It's not that I expect to improve health literacy, but to rec- ognize it and work around it,\" Lavallee says. Lavallee's hypothesisis that better patient information would help improve the patients' INR scor es, meaning the dr ug would be better managed. As well as having the potential for wide-r eaching benefits, Lavallee's study has allowed her to explore her passion: applying data collection to help patients. \"I'm fascinated by the challenges I see in the health care system and the use of medications,\" she says. Although she is unsure whether her dissertation will take her to a career in industry or academia, Lavallee is confident that her research will leave many fields open to her. /boxopen Improving Pharmacy Practice Through Research BY ROBYN FIESER 26 O FMAR YLAND ,BAL TIMORESTUDENT PROFILE CHAUNCEY LAVALLEE SCHOOL OF PHARMACY PHOTOGRAPH BY ROBERT BURKE28 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMOREPHOTOGRAPHS COURTESY OF THE SCHOOLS; MEDICAL ALUMNI ASSOCIATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, INC.; AND HEAL TH SCIEN CES AND HU MAN SERVICES LIBRARY ARCHIVES 2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 29THE LEGACY OF RIGOROUS EDUCATION, superior clinical experience, medical research, and service to the commu- nity at the University of Maryland School of Medicine reachesback to the y ears follo wing the American R evolution. During the early period of this nation, medical car efor most people meant seeking advice from the local apothecary or relying on folk remedies. The few physicians who sur vived the Revolutionary War had been trained in Europe. People who could afford it might be treated with bleedings or purgatives, considered \"state-of-the-art\" in the late 18th centur y. In1799, a group of physicians formed the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of Maryland to regulate physicians. Their goal was to pr ovide a course of study that would elevate the burgeoning pr ofession and nurture the development of medical education in America. F or many y ears, lectur es wereheld in private homes. Dr. John Beale Davidge, a physician trained at the University of Glasgow, began offering lectures on obstetrics and surgical sciences in 1802. Five years later, using his own funds, Davidgebuilt an anatomical theater and lecture hall at Fayette and Liberty streets, where students were taught human anatomy through the dissection of cadavers. Outraged by what was perceived as the desecration of human remains, angry citizens destroyed the building. Not long afterward, members of the medical society peti- tioned the state legislature to establish a permanent college of medicine in B altimor e. Established in 1807, the entity that came to be known as the University of Maryland is the fifth oldest of the 125 medical schools in the U.S., and the oldest public medical school.

The medical school was rechartered in 1812 as the University of Maryland, charged with annexing schools of law,arts and sciences, and divinity ,although the latter nev er materialized. That same year, with money raised by the medical school faculty ,the building ev entually kno wn as D avidge H all was erected at the northeast corner of Lombard and Greene streets.

I naddition, the School of M edicine became the first medical school to require anatomical dissection as a course of study and was the first school to institute a residency training program. For many years, the University of Maryland Hospital remained organized within the School of Medicine in a series ofever-larger buildings. The facility was spun off as a private, nonprofit medical center, now known collectively as the University of M aryland Medical System, in 1984. Today, the School maintains major hospital affiliations that include the University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore Veterans Affairs M edical Center ,Mercy M edical Center ,and M edStar Health. More than half of all practicing physicians in Maryland have been trained and educated at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, which was the first to incorporate medical informatics\u2014the science of electronically gathering, storing, manipulating, and r etrieving patient data\u2014into the curricu - lum.

Today the School of Medicine has 1,265 students, withmore than 600 pursuing their MD. Another 400 students are in MD/P hD or other graduate-lev el programs, and mor ethan 250 students study allied health. In addition, several organized research centers have been established that involve the School of Medicine, including the centers for health policy and healthsciences research, integrative medicine, mucosal biology, research in aging, v accine dev elopment, and v ascular and inflammatory diseases. School of Medicine programs include genetics and genomic medicine, neuroscience, oncology, and trauma. Throughout the School of Medicine's 200-year history, its faculty members have contributed many medical breakthroughs, including a cur efor typhoid fev er,the first antibiotic treatment spotted fev er,the first laparoscopic ulcer surgery, and the first simultaneous kidney-pancreas transplant. Students at the School of M edicine r eceivesuperb clinical experience in numerous settings, such as the University of Maryland Medical Center and its Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, R Adams Cowley Shock T rauma Center, and Hospital for Children.

The new school\u2014to be called the Maryland Law Institute\u2014was spearheaded by David Hoffman, a Baltimore native and prominent member of the bar who had been lecturing about law to students at the University's medical school. In 1817, Hoffman published what is regarded as America's first law textbook, ACourse of Legal Study Addressed to Students and the Profession Generally .Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Joseph Story called Hoffman's book, \"by far the most perfect system for the study of law that has ever been offered to the public.\" Hoffman's goal was to elevate the profession of law with a solid academic foundation, a course of study that was r evolutionar yat the time. A faculty of five other lawyers joined Hoffman, and in 1823 the first students enrolled for courses. Inthe early y ears, attendance was lo w,and in 1836 the Law Institute temporarily ceased operation. Hoffman, who died in 1854, did not live to see the revival of the law school in 1870 by medical faculty member Christopher Johnston, when the growing legal needs of a post-Civil War boom in the state created a demand for lawyers. John J. Donaldson, J.H.B. Latrobe Jr., Harry E. Mann, Charles K. P oe, and S amuel E. T urner Jr. were the first to graduate from the School's program.

When the University took over the Baltimore Law School in 1912, its stu-dents and faculty joined the school's structure as well. Two world wars, ho wever, took their toll on enrollment. But while student numbers fluctuated, the contents of the School's law library grew, thanks to Maryland Court ofAppeals Chief Justice Frederick W. Brune. Though not a graduate of the School, Brune had been raised by his uncle John J. D onaldson, a member of the School's first graduating class. B rune learned his lo vefor law from Donaldson's exten- sive personal law library and, upon his death, bequeathed his uncle's books, to be kept and identified as the DonaldsonCollection. Today, the School of Law's Thurgood Marshall Law Library\u2014rededicated in 1979 in honor of the legendary Maryland native\u2014contains more than 400,000 volumes ofAnglo-American legal materials, along with international and foreign law collections. TheSchool of Law now stands among the top ranked of the nation's public law schools. Taking an interdisciplinaryapproach to legal education, the law school wor ks closely with the medical, dental, nursing, social work, and pharmacy schools. Opportunities for experiential learning abound in the School's programs on clinical law (ranked fifth by U.S.News & World Report ), health care law (ranked third), and environmental law (ranked fourth). 32 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE 2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 33UNTIL THE MID-19TH CENTURY, dentistry was provided by a few physicians who chose to specialize in oral health, by practitioners who learned in apprenticeship to a dentist, or byself-taught individuals who w eremechanically inclined. S oit is no surprise that one of the founders of the world's first dental school, Dr. Horace Hayden, was a self-educated man whoseinterests ranged from art and architecture to geology and medicine. As a student of G eorge Washington's favorite dentist, John Greenwood, Hayden soon recognized the need for a systematic, formal education in dentistr y. Hayden was \"far ahead of his time,\" wrote H.L. Mencken in the 1937 Baltimore Evening Sun .\"He believed that dentistry should be taken away from the locksmiths and barbers whocommonly practiced it a century ago, and elevated it to thedignity of a medical profession.\" During the 1820s and 1830s, Hayden and a former student, Dr.Chapin A. H arris, lectured on dentistry to medical school students at the University of Maryland. In 1840, the state chartered the B altimor eCollege of D ental Surgery (BCDS), the first dental school in the world. The first official dental lecture of the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery was delivered on F eb.3, 1840, with fiv estudents in attendance. \"There were no entrance requirements; any strong young fellow with a taste for mechanics was welcome,\" Mencken noted. BCDS has served as a model of dental research, educa- tion, and clinical practice ar ound the world ever since. It took more than half a century for what would be called the U niversity of M aryland Dental School to emerge. First, the Maryland D ental College, founded in 1873, merged with the BCDS in 1878. Shortly thereafter, in 1882, the University of Maryland M edical School founded a dental depar tment. I n 1895, the Baltimore Medical College started a DentalDepartment, but by 1913, it had merged with the University of Maryland. Ultimately, the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery and the University's medical school Dental Departmentwere combined to form a distinct college\u2014what is now referred to as the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, University of Maryland Dental School. Today, the Dental School continues to lead in education, clinical services, and research. Along with the DDS degree and dental hygiene program, the School offers research and fellow-ships in subspecialties such as endodontics, oral and maxillofa- cial surgery (an MD program), orthodontics, and periodontics. Through the Dental School's Department of BiomedicalSciences, students take a multidisciplinary approach to the study of oral and craniofacial biology, as well as many other bioscience specialties. The School is the single largest provider of oral health care in the state, with students and faculty fielding more than 130,000 patient visits in its clinics each year. In addition, studentsand faculty provide comprehensive and emergency dental services to persons of all ages, including the uninsured and underser ved residents of the state. The Special Patient Clinic provides oral health car eservices to individuals with mental or physical disabilities. The School's PLUS program serves individuals living with HIV, and the Quest for Care programhelps people in financial need receive dental care services. Through continuing education programs, the Dental School faculty and guest speakers pr ovide oppor tunities for practitioners thr oughout the state to learn about current research and patient care practices. In 1999,the D ental School opened the Center for Clinical S tudies to facil- itate and suppor tclinical research and the Brotman Facial Pain Center to study and treat facial pain.

The new building, which openedin September 2006, continues a legacy of leadership in education, treatment, and research by the University of Maryland Dental School. Dental School{ Bicentennial DURING THE EARLY 19TH CENTURY, the emergence ofpharmacology from the folk tradition of materia medica (the science or study of dr ugs, their pr eparation and pr operties, and uses and effects) paralleled the stunning progress in the field of chemistr y.The isolation of alkaloids and glycosides, along with the development of vaccines, launched a far-reaching pharma- ceutical revolution. In addition, scientific methods meantremedies could formulated with kno wn str ength and purity , unlike their botanical counterparts. Lectures began at the Maryland College of Pharmacy, progenitor of the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, shortly after it was incorporated in 1841. It was the fourthschool of pharmacy in the nation, and it remains the only pharmacy school in M aryland. Initially char tered for just 30 years, the Maryland College of Pharmacy was given a permanent charter by state lawmakers in 1870, as long as its assets nev er exceeded $10,000. ( This archaic provision became obsolete when the University wasrechartered and reorganized in 1920.) The Maryland College of Pharmacy remained an independent institution until 1904,when it became part of the University of Maryland, Baltimore. In 1994, the four-year professional doctorate (PharmD)was adopted to better prepare students to deliver pharmaceutical careand integrate r esearch into clinical practice. The doctorate program is ranked eighth in the nation by U.S.News & World Report and consistently ranks in the top 10 of pharmacy schools in the nation. Aside from educating generations of pharmacists who serve in the community, the School of Pharmacy is involved in a wide range of basic and clinical research, including drug disco very and development, drug delivery systems, pharma- cogenomics, drug policy development, and drug therapy and aging. A bout 95 students ar eenrolled in P hD programs in the School.

I nfact, nuns\u2014the Catholic S isters of Charity\u2014pr ovided bedside careto Baltimore Infirmary patients until nearly the end of the 19th century. All that changed in 1889 when Louisa Parsons, a graduate of Florence Nightingale's school of nursing at St. Thomas' Hospital in London, initiated plans for a two-y ear nursing training pr ogram in Baltimore. With the assistance of medical school faculty, the University of Maryland became home to one of the nation's oldest formal nursing programs. Eight students graduated in the first classof the hospital's training school in 1892, and within a few years the curriculum was expanded to cr eate a thr ee-year program. The School of Nursing became an independent entity from the School of Medicine when the U niversity of M aryland's schools were reorganized in 1920. In 1952, the School of Nursing began offering a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN). The science and the profession of nursing grew, and the School began offering master 'sdegrees in 1954 and a P hD pr ogram in 1979. As inter est in the profession and the demand for nurses grew, a state-of-the-art addition to the existing School of Nursing building was opened in 1998 to accommodate increased enrollment. Avariety of innovative educational programs has been forged at the School, including the first nursing informatics program in the world, and the nation's first nursing health policy program. I n1999, the School of N ursing began offering a graduate pr ogram in nurse midwifer y,the only such pr ogram in the state. I nthe same year, the School opened the University of Maryland School of Nursing Living H istoryMuseum to collect, pr eserve, and exhibit ar tifacts relating to the Working in the lab and in the community, School of Pharmacy students are involved in research and outreach.

The School of Pharmacy occupies the top two floors of the building that the School shares with the School of Medicine, thereby doubling the laboratory space for School of Pharmacy researchers and students to investigate the biology of disease, mechanisms of drug action, and drug design. The School of Pharmacy continues its commitment to address the needs of the community through the MarylandPoison Center, the Drug Information Center, the Center on Drugs and Public Policy, the Office of Substance Abuse Studies, and the Peter Lamy Center for Drug Therapy and Aging. Today, the School admits 120 new PharmD students each year from a pool of more than 1,500 applicants. Graduates return to the community to practice in hospitals, retail phar- macies, or other clinical settings, while others continue on toadvanced training at the School of Pharmacy. About 70 percent of School of Pharmacy graduates continue to work and live in Maryland. Basic laboratory research has been at the foundation of the School of Pharmacy's educational philosophy since 1841.

Despite a burgeoning need for social service workers, no school in Maryland provided a course of education in the field. By the 1950s, the idea of creating a social work school began to take shape among social ser vice professional groups and University officials. After years of planning, the University of Maryland School of Social Work was chartered in 1961. The School's first home was the second and thir dfloors of the old tire and battery shop of the Hecht Company at 721 W. Redwood St., which had been used by the University as a warehouse. The School began with a dean and two faculty members. T wenty full-time and eight part-time students enr olled during the School 'sfirst year. The program grew to meet the expanding needs of the profession, from the initial master's in social work with a concentration in casework, to the incorporation ofcommunity planning b y1970. Three years later, eight candidates received the master's of community planning, and later ,social administration became the thir dconcentration within the School. Initially, the School was scattered in five different locations on the Baltimore campus, but the construction of Louis L. Kaplan Hall in 1983 allowed faculty, students, and staff tocome together under one roof at 525 W. Redwood St. Sincethen, facilities for the School were expanded in 2002 to include space in a ne wbuilding shar ed bythe School of Law. In its short history, the School of Social Work has helped to train thousands of individuals in this noble profession who serve a vital role in promoting the well-being of individuals, families, and communities. Students help serve communities through mor ethan 600 pr ograms and field instr uction sites in Baltimore, the state of Maryland, Washington, D.C., and throughout the mid-Atlantic region. The Center for Maternal and Child Health Social Work Education is dedicated to the study of psy chosocial and societal factors that affect the health of infants, children, adolescents, and their families.

In September 2005, two of the Wellmobiles w eredispatched to Brookhaven, Miss., to care for 2,000 people displaced by Hurricane Katrina. In addition, the School of Nursing provides nurse practitioner services at 12 school-based wellness centers in Baltimore, Harford, and Dorchester counties. Today,the U niversity of M aryland has the largest nursing school in the state, with approximately 1,400 students enrolled. About 41 per- cent of the state's professional nurse workforce graduated from the University of Maryland School of Nursing, and U.S.N ews & World Report consistently ranks it among the nation 's top 10 graduate schools.

RESEARCH PATIENT CARE COMMUNITY SERVICEDANIELLEPETERSONWhile leading a wide-ranging revolution in the treatment of breast cancer, world-renownedbiochemist Angela Brodie, PhD, also chartered an unusual career path. And though the soft-spoken Brodie might not emphasize her accomplishments, the achievements realized by this 70-year-old professor of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics at the University of Maryland School of Medicine speak v olumes about her life 's work. Brodie's pioneering research on aromatase inhibitors led to the first new drug in a decade (released in 1994) specifically designed for the treatmentof breast cancer. As an international cancer researcher, Brodie developed a drug therapy that helps pr event recurrence of breast cancer in post-menopausal women b yreducing the lev el of estr ogen produced b ythe body .InJune 2005, in r ecognition of her scientific discovery and subsequent medical breakthrough, Brodie became the first woman to receive the Charles F .Kettering P rize, considered by many in the medical community to be the \"Nobel Prize\" of cancer research. The award, one of three $250,000 prizes presented annually by the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation,is besto wed on scientists who make an outstanding contribu- tion toward the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of cancer. Brodie earned the prize for developing formestane (4-hydroxy- androstenedione), the first in an entir ely ne wclass of dr ugs called aromatase inhibitors. These drugs have been proved to prevent post-menopausal women from developing recurring bouts of hormone-dependent breast cancer, which includes 70 percent of all breast cancer.Formestane is also being used to treat breast cancer that has metastasiz ed. The drug works by \"starving\" hormone-dependent cancers of estr ogen\u2014their primar ysource of fuel. Recent studies are proving these inhibitors to be significantly moreeffectiv ethan the standar dbreast cancer dr ug, tamoxifen,which stops working after five years. While tamoxifen blocks the effect of estrogen, aromatase inhibitors actually stop the pro- duction of estrogen. \"Using aromatase inhibitors, there is a sta- tistically significant improvement over tamoxifen,\" Brodie says. \"Today, the drugs Angela developed that are in clinical use have reduced the recurrence of breast cancer by as much as 40 percent for some women. That translates into tens of thou- sands of women worldwide,\" says Kevin Cullen, MD, directorof the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart GreenebaumCancer Center. \"Now, we're finding out that these drugs mayalso prevent breast cancer in a significant number of womenwho ar eat high risk.\" When Brodie first began studying estrogen and its effects on hormone-dependent breast cancer in the 1970s, she couldnot hav epredicted the successful outcomes she would ev entually obtain. She simply followed her instincts, refusing to relent even when few others believed in them. \"It seemed like there should be a better way of doing things,\" Brodie says matter-of-factly, reflecting on earlier, less effectiv emethods of blocking estrogen from advancing the growth of breast cancer. First there was the removal of women's ovaries, which Brodie calls \"horrendous.\" Next came hypophy-sectomy-surgical r emoval of the pituitar ygland. \"I t'sasortof gruesome surgery that resulted in a lot of morbidities and mortalities.\" Continuing a Family T radition Brodie, who was born and raised in Manchester, England, found herself caught up in the world of science long befor eshe entered into a research career. \"I was always interested in beingascientist. I hadn't thought about being anything else,\" Brodie recalls. S he credits this in large par tto \"alot of ' science talk 'at home.\" Brodie's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were all chemists in Manchester.

Third-year medical student Audrey Segal trusted similar instincts while pursuing a medical career. Now scheduled to graduate with the University of Maryland School of Medicine Class of 2007, Segal had just embarked on her dream of becoming a physician when she was diagnosedwith a rar eblood disor der known as aplastic anemia. Initially, Segal thought her extreme fatigue was due to seemingly endless hours of late-night studying. B ut when bruises and small red marks appear ed on her chest and arms, she had the first hint that something was amiss. Segal grew up in Canada, where she pursued an avid interest in gymnastics. E xtremely activ eand healthy ,the medical student was caught off guard by the severity of her diagnosis. Aplastic anemia renders the body incapable of normal blood cell production and r equir es immediate tr eatment in the form of immunosuppressive therapy, blood transfusions, and/or bone marrow transplant. Treatment itself is time-consuming and draining. Since her October 2004 diagnosis, S egal has undergone two transfusions each month. Despite the surprise of her diagnosis and the time r equir ed for treatment, Segal remains steadfast in her devotion andcommitment to medical school. She entered medical school with a desire to pursue a specialty in pediatrics. Her interesttoday leans more toward pediatric oncology and hematology. \"Maybe it's because I can relate to patients more. A lot of things they're going through, I've gone through too. It's definitely impacted how I talk to patients and how I relate to patients.\" Segal says she has been \"incredibly inspired\" by the children she has met in her experiences atthe University of Maryland Medical Center\u2014 patients with an optimistic outlook and few complaints. Many see these same traits in S egal herself . She had just completed her first year of medical school, and was in the second month of her second year when shehad to reconcile the devastation of her diagnosis with her dreams for the future. \"Did I stay in school or did I take time off?\" Therewerethoughts of r eturning to Canada to be close to friends and family. But Segal chose to remain at the UMB campus\u2014the place that fostered an environment where shecould mo veforward. \"I came down for my initial interview and loved it,\" Segal recalls. \"It just seemed like the faculty were so interested in students. The professors here know my name. Everyone is so friendly ,so suppor tive, and they have been wonderful through- out this experience.\" Segal took just two months off from her studies\u2014making up the wor kthat summer\u2014but ther ehavebeen points of exhaustion along the way when she's slept for 16 hours at a time. Her transfusions have been accompanied by a series of infections, side effects from medications, and a skin cancer scare. Segal, however, remains undeterred as she continues totake life day by day. \"I am so happy I stay ed in school. I could have gone home and felt sorry for myself. I could feel sorry forever. Instead, Iam pursuing my dreams. And,\" she adds, \"I have my whole life ahead of me.\" Segal's survival hinges on the availability of blood\u2014and the gener osity of strangers who pr ovide donations. \" When I think about my own treatments, that's 60 people who have saved my life. That's a big thing for me to impart to people\u2014how important it is to donate blood.\" For information on blood donation, visit www.givelife.org. /boxopen Keeping Her Eyes on the Prize BY GWEN NEWMANSTUDENT PROFILE AUDREY SEGAL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE PHOTOGRAPH BY ROBERT BURKE 42 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMOREpioneering organic chemist in the polyurethane industry. The anti-tank hand grenade that he designed for use in World War II earned the acclaim of Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Inspite of following the long line of chemists in her family, Brodie points out that she did deviate slightly from their career paths. \"I was interested in biology. So I guess I did rebel a little by becoming a biochemist,\" she says with a laugh. From Concept to Clinical Application Brodie's lifelong study of the link between estrogen and breast cancer began in 1962. That year, she received a NationalInstitutes of Health-sponsored fellowship at the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Mass. She met other influential scientists there, including her husband,Harry Brodie, an organic chemist. During the next 18 years, Angela Brodie concentrated on developing aromatase inhibitors. Since 1975, her research has been supported through funding from the National Institutes of Health. After moving to the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1979, Brodie developed a collaboration with an oncologist in London. In the first clinical trial, which enrolled 11 women with advanced breast cancer, four of the subjectsshowed immediate and significant improvement. After treat- ment with aromatase inhibitors, the tumors shrunk to less than half their original siz e. Not until then did pharmaceutical companies sho winterest in funding B rodie'sworkon aromatase inhibitors. Novartis (then Ciba-Geigy) agreed to support addi- tional, larger-scale trials after learning of the remarkable results. ANew Approach to T reatment Although Brodie's professional trajectory seems like a smooth, steady ascent to outsiders\u2014and she won't come out and say otherwise\u2014it has not been without challenges. Brodie's first paper on the efficacy of aromatase inhibitors was rejected by the editors of the journal Cancer Research in 1976; they called the findings \" too ob vious.\" B rodie r emained undeterred. \"We revised the paper and added more convincing evidence, and it was published.\" Years later, Brodie is now an editor of Cancer Research . V. Craig Jordan, PhD, vice president and research director at Philadelphia's Fox Chase Cancer Center, confirms Brodie's per- sistence. \" Angela is quiet but precise with remarkable tenacity to do what others believed to be impossible: to create a newapproach to treat breast cancer,\" says Brodie's former colleague. \"Angela 'stranslational r esearch and the practical applications of her vision have changed health care,\" says Jordan. ARole Model for Women While Brodie was fighting the challenging battle of convinc- ing the scientific community to accept an entirely new way tofight a deadly disease, she and her husband were also raisingtwo childr en. In1956, B rodie graduated with honors from the Universityof Sheffield in Great Britain with a degree in biochemistry. About pursuing her research goals and raising a family in the 1950s, Brodie says, \"I was very keen on doing both things.\" Brodie acknowledges that it required many prudent deci- sions and sacrifices. \"I was able to work part-time when the children were very young. I had good child care. We also lived only about 10 minutes from the lab. Nevertheless, I did work in the evening and weekends as needed,\" she says. Brodie's ability to strike a strong work-family balance and succeed on both fronts has not gone unnoticed by colleagues and students. \"She is a really good role model for me becauseshe is a woman and has a family, and is really devoted to her research,\" says Wei Yue, PhD, MD, a former student of Brodie's who is now associate professor of research of internal medicineand endocrinology at the University of Virginia. Breaking Through Professional Barriers Women entering scientific professions in the 1950s often encountered hostile working environments. For example,female astr onomers were banned from using the 200-inch telescope at Mount Palomar, wrote Helen Hill Miller in a 1957 article in The Atlantic Monthly .And some industrial corpora- tions refused to hire women engineers, according to Miller. But Brodie had the advantage of beginning her research career at the Worcester Foundation\u2014in a lab headed by a woman and wher eseveral female scientists w erecarrying out research. It was at the Worcester Foundation in 1957 that scientists developed the birth control pill, just one of severalfoundation pr ojects r elating to women's health. Although Brodie describes her professional path as \"some- what lonely,\" co-workers depict her as someone who alwaysextends herself wherever there is a need. \"She has achieved more than almost any of us in science could ever dream of, and has done it in a way that is completely collegial and generous,\" Cullen notes. \"She's always the one who will be on the graduate student thesis boar d, or who will review a draft for a younger faculty member.\" Yue agrees: \"Whenever I had a question or a problem, I could knock on her door and discuss it with her. She didn't just meet with students once a week. Every day she was there, andshe was always very helpful.\" Professionally and personally, Brodie, who received the Brinker International Breast Cancer Award for Basic Researchfrom the Susan G. Komen Foundation in 2000 and the Dorothy P .Landon American Association for Cancer R esearch Prize in 2006, has set an unparalleled path for emerging scien- tists to follo w.\"She is the cr owning example of the ex cellence that exists here at the University of Maryland,\" Cullen says. At 70 years of age, Brodie is not ready to detour from the road she has paved for cancer research. Her laboratory is now investigating inhibitors of androgen synthesis as potential agentsfor treating prostate cancer. \"Actually, it seems like the pace is just speeding up ,\" says B rodie.

Researchers at the Dental School are involved in a variety of patient-care enhancing investigations. They include the study of biofilms (drug-resistant microbial communities), bone scaffolds and modeling, implantintegrity, regeneration of the periodontium (the connective tissue surrounding the root of a tooth), genomics and proteomics (the study of genes and their related proteins with regard to drugdiscovery and tissue engineering), tissue targeting, and tissue imaging. Basic research in tissue engineering, for example, has found practical applications in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Researchers from the Biomaterials Lab have developed adegradable \"scaffold.\" It consists of bone-cell generating osteo- progenitors, encapsulated in a hydrogel, that signal the regener- ation of replacement bone matter when placed in an area where bone has been lost due to trauma or disease. \"The ultimate idea is to replace the patient's missing tissue with like tissue ... all while minimizing donor morbidity issues involved with harvesting patient tissue for reconstructive purposes,\" explains J ohn Caccamese, DMD, MD, oral and maxillofacial surgeon and assistant pr ofessor in the D epartment of O ral and Maxillofacial Surgery. When engineering students see the clinical relevance of their basic r esearch, they become r eally excited about their work, says Assistant Professor of Bioengineering John Fisher, PhD, who heads the Biomaterials Lab in the College Park engineering school's Fischell Department of Bioengineering. \"We could develop the best materials in the world, but if they w ere not feasible for use in an actual surgical setting, they would be of no use,\" F isher explains. F isher has been appointed as an adjunct assistant professor in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surger yto intr oduce some of his lab's biomaterials concepts to Dental School students. Managing pain and preventing infection also are two very impor tant issues r elating to patient car eand satisfaction. Solutions to both of these clinical problems can be found in the science of nanomedicine, which involves monitoring, repairing, and affecting biological systems at the molecular level through the use of tiny ,engineered devices and structures ( see related story, page 53 ). In nanomedicine, a polymeric carrier that has New Frontiers in Dental New Frontiers in Dental BY MARY SPIROResearch and E ducation Research and Educationbeen functionalized for drug delivery can target drugs to very specific sites within the head or neck, while minimizing theimpact on surrounding tissue. \"Through nanomedicine, we can not only follow the fate of drug delivery by tracking where it goes (with various imagingmodalities), but we are also working on ways of correlating these drug delivery systems to their therapeutic effect,\" explains Hamid Ghandehari, PhD, associate professor in the School ofPharmacy and director of the Center for Nanomedicine and Cellular Delivery. In addition, targeted drug delivery systems can be used to treat patients with cancer in the head or neck, or to alleviateinflammation caused by infectious diseases. Patients being treated for a multitude of oral, cranial, or maxillofacial conditions arefinding relief through these targeted drug delivery systems developed through basic research. Research findings that improve clinical care will, in turn, propel curriculum in new directions, forming the foundations of new courses for the Dental School. \"We will start with introduc- tory interdisciplinary courses in translational research and trans- lational research applications and then assess student interest inother areas,\" Caccamese says. Because of this interdisciplinary approach, clinicians and students alike will have to look beyondtheir ar ea of exper tise to the basic sciences for solutions, S auk adds. Along with the research and educational advances made through these early collaborative efforts, partnerships with business and industr yalso will incr ease. One such example is the $2 million grant to the D ental School fr om N obel B iocare to launch new initiatives in curriculum, patient care, research, and development in advanced techniques in dental implants,esthetic dentistry, and guided surgery. In addition, opportunities for ideas generated thr ough the Dental School initiative also may be tested, dev eloped, and commercialized by bioscience companies working at the UMB BioPark. For more than two decades, judges, lawyers, and juries hav erelied on DNA tests to establish identity to help convict the guilty, free the innocent, and determine paternity. But when it comes to usingthese tests for identifying health and behavioral traits that can play an important role in the outcome of the case, the legal system is forging ne wground, and there is not always a consensus on what that gr ound should co ver. Enter Diane Hoffmann, JD, MS, associate dean of the School of Law and dir ector of the Law and Health Care Program, and Kar en H. Rothenberg, JD, MPA, dean of the School. Intrigued by how judges are making decisions about whetherto compel or admit genetic tests, they decided to survey thestate's judges. They received responses from 101 of 140 state circuit cour tand 16 of 25 Maryland federal district court judges. \"What we found was that the judges were quite sophisticated and discriminating in their willingness to use the tests or to havethem play a r ole in litigation,\" says H offmann. Hoffmann and Rothenberg designed their survey around a series of hypothetical criminal and civil cases. The results of their two-and-a-half year effort, the first of its kind in the nation, were published in an October 2005 edition of Science magazine, the fifth article on genetic policy that Rothenberg has co-author ed for the magazine during the last 10 years. They're working on publishing a major law review article on the sur vey. \"The wor kwe're doing is cutting edge,\" says Rothenberg. \"Few of these cases have yet to reach the courts,\" she adds. \"After w ereceived the judges 'responses, it became clear to us that we needed to better understand why they answered thequestions the way they did,\" says Hoffmann. Hoffmann and Rothenberg organized meetings with groups of judges in five of the state circuit courts and in the state's federal district cour tto discuss the r esults of their sur vey. \"Not only were we able to get good information qualita- tively and quantitativ ely, but it was also a chance for the judges to talk among themselv es about these issues, and for them to continue to debate them,\" says Rothenberg. In the criminal cases, 54 percent of the state and 38 percent of the federal judges would allow a positive genetic test for schizophrenia to show that the defendant did not have the nec- essaryintent to commit the crime. \" This case,\" says H offmann, \"gave the judges considerable concern. They were really divided about whether to admit the test, even when it was at therequest of the defendant. Several judges said, 'The ultimate question would be whether the information would be more prejudicial than probative,' while others said an expert witness in genetic testing ' could help jurors interpret the test results.'\" The judges were even more cautious in the area of sentenc- ing. O nly 18 per cent of the state and 15 per cent of the federal judges said they would compel a defendant to be tested for a condition that brings on bouts of rage in order to show the defendant's potential for violence. \"In this area, they're trying to predict, 'Is this person going to be a danger to society\u2014can we let them out?'\" says Hoffmann. \"Even at the sentencing phase, where there are fewer privacy concerns and constitutional matters, they reallythought this was branding someone, or stigmatizing someone in a way that was v eryunfair.\" By contrast, more judges would compel genetic tests in a civil case when determining the issue of causation in or der to showthat the plaintiff 'sdevelopmental disabilities w ere due to agenetic defect and not the defendant's negligence. Eighty-four percent of the state and 75 per cent of the federal judges would compel the test in a case where an obstetrician is sued for medical malpractice, to help determine whether the child's 46 UNIVERSITY O FMARYLAND, BALTIMORE PHOTOGRAPH BY CARLOS ALEJANDROGenetic Testing in the Courtroom 2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 47developmental disabilities were a result of a genetic defect or the physician's negligence. Regarding damages, the judges were hesitant to force a plaintiff to take a test to determine if that person had a disease that would decrease his or her life span, because such a diseasecould decrease the amount the defendant would have to pay. Only 44 per cent of the state and 39 percent of the federal judges said yes to such a test. When it comes to admitting a test that shows the plaintiff has an increased sensitivity to pain, which could lead to a higher damages awar d, ho wever,82 percent of the state and 62 percent of the federal judges would allow such atest. Judges also considered how a jury would comprehend the questions that are raised by genetic testing. \"I think judges arevery concerned whether juries would be confused by the test or rely too much on them by seeing them as hard evidence,\" Hoffmann says. \"B ut that's a situation that's not totally unique to genetic tests\u2014it often happens when jur ors ar epresented with a lot of scientific evidence.\" The study raises a number of complex and significant issues that will be debated in the judiciar yfor years to come, adds Hoffmann.\"Our goal is that the study would be helpful to judges, and it's not just judges that are our target,\" says Hoffmann. \"We're talking about rules governing the introduction of evidence\u2014 whether judges should compel a test and then admit it into evi-dence. And those rules may be determined by a group of policy makers, legislators and judiciar ymembers, or appellate judges.\" She cr edits the success of the survey to the partnership between herself and Rothenberg. \"Her expertise in the field and her respect among the judiciar yboth informed the sur vey and ensured a good response from the judiciary,\" says Hoffmann. The dean adds, \"It was great to work together on the survey. Itis special to hav eacolleague with whom y ou can do such groundbreaking work.\" \"It's still very early in the introduction of these tests into the legal process so we don't have a lot of experience as to how judges ar eviewing them,\" says Hoffmann. \"It's likely that judges will start to see them more and have to deal with the issue\u2014the whole r elationship betw een genes and behavioral traits.\" As to the import of this survey and future surveys that may follow, Hoffmann and Rothenberg know that this is just the beginning of the debate that could ultimately help lead to a better consensus about the use of genetic tests in the courtroom.BY LORI ROMERMAINTAINING A DELICATE BALANCE: /boxopenApril 26, 2006, marked the 20th anniversary of the nuclear accident at Chernobyl in the Ukraine. When anuclear reactor exploded at 1:23 in the morning and burned, spewing radioactivity far and wide, authorities were unprepared to treat those individuals who had received lethal doses of radiation. Many people did not realize they were in danger. Oral his- tories taken fr om sur vivors in ensuing y ears revealed that citizens living in the shadow of Chernobyl, and in the path of the deadly wind following the meltdown, had little to no knowl-edge of radiation hazards. Some sat on their rooftops, watching, awed, as the flames roared and the invisible, deadly rain poured down. I nconflict still is the total number of the casualties who died fr om lethal doses of radiation in the hours, days, and w eeks following the tragedy. Ifanuclear incident occurr ed in the U nited S tates, either by accident or design, how ready are we to deal with large numbers of severely radiated victims suffering acute radiationsyndr ome (ARS)? A ccording to Thomas MacVittie, PhD, pro- fessor of radiation oncology at the School of M edicine, w eare not ready\u2014not by a long stretch. Although Americans lived in fear of a nuclear attack during the Cold War, preparations for treating mass radiation casualties in the aftermath of a nuclear accident or attack ar estill lacking, even with post-Chernobyl knowledge. \"Chernob yl is a good example\u2014from a treatment perspective\u2014 of a situation in which a large number of people survived lethal doses of radiation because of exper tsuppor tivecare, despite the fact that victims w tr eated with available appro- priate therapeutics or mitigators,\" MacVittie, principal investigator (P on a fiv e-year,$46 million N ational I nstitute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) grant aimed at clinical preparation for a nuclear incident. According to MacVittie, supportive care in combination with available drugs is still the best treatment protocol availabletoday. \"Good supportive care\u2014with fluids, antibiotics, nutri-tional support, and blood products\u2014can save the lives ofseverely irradiated people,\" he explains. But MacVittie and histeam, which includes exper ts fromthe University of Illinois- Chicago and I ndiana U niversity as well as from UMB, are exploring other treatment protocols for high numbers of casualties fr om a nuclear accident or attack. Although treating radiation exposure is a complex public health issue with many unkno wn factors, the wor kfunded b y the largest research contract ever received by the School of Medicine is not aimed at evaluating threat scenarios, nor areinvestigators charged with devising public health logistical efforts necessary to treat victims. For MacVittie and colleagues, the top priority is testing candidate medications that might pr oveuseful in treating large numbers of sev erely irradiated patients with serious r espiratory, gastrointestinal, and blood cell damage. Today a nuclear attack is less likely to come from the warhead of an intercontinental ballistic missile, as was feared during theCold War.Amore likely scenario is the detonation of an improvised nuclear device (IND) by a terrorist. MacVittie says, \"We are not talking about a 'dirty bomb,'\" aradiation dispersal device that would probably not be highly destructive, nor produce ARS. Rather, the mass casualty treat- ment scenario focuses on the detonation of a fairly large, per - haps one kiloton improvised nuclear device (the Hiroshima atomic bomb was 12 kilotons) that could pr oduce a thousand or more moderately or severely radiated casualties. According to M acVittie and a co-inv estigator Ann F arese, MS, research associate in the Department of Radiation Oncology, there is a great need for more practical approaches to protect the American public from the aftereffects of radia- tion fr om an IND. They point out, however, that there are currently no drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the tr eatment of lethally irradiated people. Treatment dr ugs could include drugs that are already approved for treating the aftereffects of chemotherapy, such as 48 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE ILLUSTRATION BY DOUGLAS FRASERSCHOOL OF MEDICINE RESEARCH: Targeting the Effects ofMass Radiation 2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 49neupogen, uelasta, and interleukin-11, but the drugs must be approved by the FDA for such an application. In the event of mass exposure to radiation, the first chal- lenge would be sorting out the degree of victim exposure.Patients with Lev el I exposure could be treated as outpatients. Level II, moderate exposure, would require closer attention. Those irradiated at Level III would be considered severely irradiated and would hav eto be hospitalized. Level IV would involve victims who, without aggressive treatment, would succumb to fatal doses. Symptoms of ARS include malaise, nausea, v omiting, and loss of consciousness. Those receiving severely high doses of radiation would suffer thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets) and granulocytopenia (lo wwhite blood cells) as the lethal doses of radiation shut down the production of these cells aimed atfighting infection and preventing bleeding. However, some victims could be rescued from both kinds of blood injury only to succumb to a fatal gastrointestinal (GI) crisis. Severe radiation exposure would destroy cells in the GI tract, preventing the mucosal barrier from doing its job ofscreening out noxious bacteria and chemicals. The destruction would also pr event the stem cells that line the GI tract from carrying out their normal, three-day, total rejuvenation cycle.The hope would be, that with appropriate supportive care and newtreatments to pr omote cell r egrowth, the GI tract could be stabilized and regenerated toward normalcy. \"Those exposed to high doses of radiation can sur viveif fluids are replenished, antibiotics are given, electrolyte imbalances are restored, and the mucosal immune system is stabiliz ed and recolonized with resistant flora,\" says Alessio Fasano, MD, pedi- atric gastroenterologist, director of the School of Medicine'sMucosal Biology Research Center, and co-PI on the NIAID grant. \"B lood cells and platelets can be r eplenished b ytransfu - sion, but the function of the GI tract, particularly its barrier function, must be r ebuilt by promoting cell growth\u2014if patients areto sur vive.\" Since there are no FDA-approved drugs for treating those lethally radiated, M acVittie's team is looking at current medica- tions and determining how they can be better used. The blood- forming system, like the GI tract, must be similarly rebuiltusing drugs that stimulate stem cells to renew themselves. Existing drugs should be stockpiled, along with antibiotics such as Cipro \u00ae,for use in the event of an IND incident, sug- gests M acVittie. Furthermore, drugs already approved for use in the clinic to treat chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression (inhibition of the bone marrow's production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) and mucositis (inflammation of the lining of the mouth, throat, or GI tract) should be made available in all clinical tr eatment centers and hospitals. M acVittie also notes that there are no treatments for victims with both high irradiation levels and injuries, such as severe burns or other trauma. Although treating mass casualties in the event of an IND incident is the impetus for the grant, finding better protocols for treating the medical needs of radiated cancer patients is a study application that could be applied to ev eryday clinical use, says MacVittie. \"The advantage with clinically administered radiation is we can control the dose,\" says MacVittie. \"That's not the case with an IND of course. B ut what w elearn about cellular r egenera- tion and accelerating cellular gr owth in this study will hav ea profound effect on the treatment for patients receiving radiation and/or chemotherapy .\" /boxopenBY RANDOLPH FILLMORE2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 51There's an old proverb that asks the rhetorical question: How do you eat an elephant? The answ er: One bite at a time. Likewise, tackling the public health challenges of the 21st century only can be accomplished one step at a time. Public health efforts focus on health not disease, areproactive not reactive, and address populations rather than individuals. An inter disciplinary approach that involves scien- tists, policymakers, researchers, and outreach workers will helpfind solutions to the problems that plague modern societies, such as car diovascular disease, infectious diseases, psychiatric disease, and physical injuries, to name just a fe w. In the last century, public health professionals created tremendous momentum for positiv echange. I nfant mor tality is down and life expectancy is up. But since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, and with the U.S. population surpassing 300 million people, what is expected of public health professionals today will change by tomorrow. Diseases linked to population, aging,and environment, as well as the threat of bioterrorism, have altered the landscape of public health forever. Add to this the fact that the American P ublic Health Association reports that 50 percent of the federal public health workforce and 25 per cent of the wor kforce among states\u2014 including Maryland\u2014will retire in the next five years, and the need for new, highly skilled public health professionals becomes apparent. To meet this challenge, the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) established the School of PublicHealth in 2006\u2014the University's seventh professional school and the first new school at UMB in 45 years. \"Professionally trained public health workers are urgentlyneeded,\" says David J. Ramsay, DM, DPhil, University presi- dent, who cites a 2003 report by the Institute of Medicine on the future of public health. \"Nationally, it has been estimatedthat 80 percent of public health workers lack specific publichealth training, and only 22 percent of chief executives of local health departments have graduate degrees in public health.\" In June 2006, the University System of Maryland Board of Regents approved the creation of the School with the understand- ing that UMB will work collaboratively with the University of Maryland, College Park, which seeks to create its own school ofpublic health. In October 2006, UMB received approval fromthe Council on Education for Public Health to begin the process of accreditation for the new School. UMB has been offering a public health professional degree, the M aster of Public Health, through the School of Medicine since 2004. Graduate degree programs in epidemiology and preventive medicine, toxicology, and gerontology have been available for several years. \"The mission of the School of Public Health is to advance the health of diverse populations in Maryland and elsewhere,\"says Ramsay .\"Itwill accomplish this b ypreparing public health leaders to serve the community; investigating population-based causes, prevention, and treatment of health problems; anddeveloping collaborative initiatives in teaching, research, and service.\" Dedication to community outreach through partnerships with state and local health offices and other public ser vice agencies is one important component of the University of Maryland School of Public Health, says Charlene Quinn, PhD,RN, the School 'sinterim associate dean for public health outreach and an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine in the School of Medicine. \"Local public health issues need the support of a university- based school of public health to translate r esearch into targeted solutions and to provide services,\" says J. Glenn Morris Jr., MD, MPH&TM, interim dean of the School of Public Health and professor and chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine. For instance, r ecent incidents of food-borne disease (e.g., bagged spinach contaminated with E. coli )could be studied locally by public health faculty, researchers, and students, Morris adds. Morris anticipates that outreach efforts at the School of Public Health also will include the following: aging, injury prevention and contr ol, health disparities among individuals with chr onic diseases, epidemiology of infectious diseases, public policy, toxicology, women's health, preventive medicine, biostatistics, animal-to-human disease transmission, and others. The dean of the School of Social Work, Richard P . Barth, PhD, MSW, heads the interdisciplinary committee managing the search for a dean of the School of Public Health. The School will be headquartered on the third floor of BuildingT wo of the UMB BioPark, with an anticipated move-in date of November 2007. /boxopen SCHOOL PROFILE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH 50 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMOREM.Jane Matjasko, MD, believes in the power of education. S he learned early in life that mindset can triumph o ver lack of funds when it comes to achieving one's life goals. After reaching the pinnacle of her own car eer,Matjasko is determined not to let lack of funds hinder other individuals with a passion for her field of anesthe- siology. After 30 years as a pioneer in her profession, Matjasko describes her background as \"pretty simple.\" Although her mother graduated fr om high school, her father nev er did. As one of six children, Matjasko realized it was not wealth that would allow the Matjasko children to achieve their dreams, but rather sheer determination and oppor tunity. \"Whatever we did was going to be difficult,\" she r eflects. \"S owhy not do exactly what you wanted?\" Hardworkis what first exposed M atjasko to the world of medicine. O ne of her summer jobs was in a hospital in her hometown of Pittsburgh. She worked in central supply, stock-ing shelv es and cleaning inv entor y.Although the wor kwas tedious, the young Matjasko became hooked on the study ofmedicine.After graduating from the Medical College of Pennsylvania, she became an intern at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in 1968. She joined the faculty in 1972 as an instruc-tor, and in 1990 she was appointed professor and chair of the Department of Anesthesiology. Matjasko was not only one of the first females to chair a department at the University ofMaryland School of Medicine\u2014but also one of the first in the United States. Described as a trailblazer, Matjasko is goal-oriented and quick to identify needs as well as areas of opportunity and growth. After her retirement in November 2005, she and herhusband, S hao-H uang Chiu, MD, who trained in orthopedics at the U niversity of M aryland, decided to support the School of Medicine and the Department of Anesthesiology with a generous donation. Through their gift, two endowed professorships have been established in Matjasko's honor to enhance and support ongoingresearch and education in the School's Department ofAnesthesiology .The endo wments will pr ovide a continuous stream of funding that will incr ease o ver time, ensuring that the department can hire and support the brightest minds in the field of anesthesiology. The field of anesthesiology ,with its \" great reputation for patient safety,\" has become one of the most popular and sought after professions in medicine, notes Matjasko. Yet a shortage of clinicians in the 1990s led to a subsequent lag in funding for research and education. \"Everybody had to be 'all-hands-on-deck,'\" recalls Matjasko, one of the charter members and past presidents of the Society of Neurosurgical Anesthesia and Critical Care. \"The situation requir ed full attention to the clinical mission. O nce I realized what was happening, I began thinking of ways to impr ovethe situation. This gift,\" she says, \"was just a natural, an opportunity wecouldn 'tlet pass b y.\" The Matjasko gift establishes the first endowed professor- ships for the Department of Anesthesiology. The first chair in the department was named in honor of Martin Helrich, MD, in 1987 at Matjasko's suggestion. The Bicentennial Campaignfor the University of Maryland School of Medicine hopes to establish an endo wed chair or professorship in each of its 24 academic depar tments. /boxopen Fostering a Promising Future for Anesthesiology BYGWEN NEWMAN M.

Rexahn Pharmaceuticals, based in Rockville, Md., has ongoing clinical development programsfor the treatment of cancer as well as drugs relatedto treating diseases of the central nervous system. However, the company would like to find novel and more effective ways to deliver those drugs. \"Drug delivery is what we do for a living,\" confirms H amid G handehari, P hD, dir ector of the CNCD and professor in the School of Pharmacy.

Himmelfarb, member of the Board of Directors of the Health Sciences Research Park Corporation and chair of the University of Maryland BaltimoreFoundation, Inc. \"In less than two years, we went from the acquisition of 4.7 acres of vacant land from the City of Baltimore to one completed building, a par king garage, solid plans for two more buildings, and additional acreage to double the size of the project beyond its initial scope.\" About 200 employees now work in Building One, and the number is growing as companies like Alba Therapeutics Corporation continue to add staff to speed the development of its ne wcompounds. O fthe 120,000-squar e-foot building, 85,000 square feet are devoted to lab space, 40 percent more than expected. \"We have a great mix of tenants including UMB scientists conducting basic research, commercial spinoffs of UMB and Johns Hopkins University, a significant international company,and companies and organizations pr oviding impor tant ser vices to the biomedical industr y,\" says J im H ughes, vice pr esident for research and development at UMB. The early-stage companies of F ASgen ;Irazu B ioDiscovery,LLC; and Acidophil, LLC, are the latest tenants to occupy Building One. They join UMB's Center for Vascular and The Harbor Bank of Maryland; and the life science practice of Miles & Stockbridge P .C. Current research includes the development of therapeutics for cancer and metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes,and drugs that mimic the known biological protection and age- decelerating effects of severe caloric restriction. \"UMB BioPark companies have the potential to develop anumber of important new treatments for some of society's major diseases,\" says Hughes. The vision for the BioPark includes fostering collaboration between University researchers and BioPark companies. Thetwo companies founded on UMB technology, Alba Therapeutics Corp. and UPM Pharmaceuticals, have extensive interactionswith the University. \"Being in the BioPark gives us immediate access to the University and its facilities,\" says Blake Paterson, CEO of AlbaTherapeutics Corp .\"It'safluid access that enhances the pr o- ductivity and quality of work. This cross-fertilization is unique.\" Another goal for the B ioPark is to promote economic devel- opment in the surr ounding P oppleton community ,which has suffered from years of urban decay and disinvestment. As part of its commitment to the community, Building One developerTownsend Capital, LLC, has pledged yearly donations to support community-related programs. In2006, Townsend gave nearly $30,000 to the Poppleton Village Center Corporation to support its job training and educational pr ograms. The amounts are expected to grow as more buildings are developed. Across Baltimore Street, Building T wo is well under con- struction with completion expected in summer 2007. UMB's new School of Public Health is the first tenant to lease space in the ne wbuilding, which is being developed by Wexford Science &Technology, LLC. At 215,000 square feet, the building will be nearly twice the siz eof Building O ne. Special features of Building T wo include a 100-seat auditorium, conference rooms, and a 10,000-square-foot vivarium.

At the same time, researchers with links to industry can benefit as their ideas and their hard work make a difference in patients' lives. According to Steinfels, Rexahn wanted the opportunity to access technology developed at the University. That would accelerate the timeline needed to implement new technology. \"The reasons why companies should enter into a joint venture like ours with the University of Maryland are many,\" says Steinfels. \"First, we hope to increase the speed of drugdevelopment and shorten the time to market. Second, the partnership also provides us with research and development expertise, including technology and a com-petitive edge, especially in drug delivery.We want to see how far we can leverage the opportunity between Rexahn and the University to maximize the benefits for both parties, and ultimately, for patients.\" And that 's where the \"antisense\" comes in. Antisense dr ugs pr event genes from producing harmful proteins that can cause cancer. The center and Rexahn are currently working together on developing a nano- sized (a nano is one billionth of a meter) deliverysystem for its ne wdrug RX-0201, designed to treat several types of cancers. For their part, Ghandehari and colleaguesaredesigning an oligonucleotide-based delivery system to deliver antisense genetic materials to deo xyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA). Oligonucleotides are synthetic short sequence nucleotides, or sub-units ofDNA or RNA. Complementary (anti- sense) nucleic acids, or copies, can be designed to bind to specific messenger RNA molecules. I nother wor ds, antisense oligonucleotides are single strands of DNA or RNA manipu- lated in the lab to form complementar ycopies of normal DNA or RNA, but they can be used to de-activate disease-causing genes by binding to the genetic material that they copy. While using oligonucleotides and antisense strategy is on the cutting edge of drug therapy, the potential has great promise only if the antisense oligonucleotides can be delivered effica- ciously .That's not easy, notes Ghandehari. Since the expression of some proteins causes disease, intact delivery of the oligonu- cleotide will be therapeutically essential. \"Oligonucleotides are easily degraded in the blood and noteasily transported across cell membranes,\" says Ghandehari. \"Intact, they can interfere with the machinery that expresses proteins.\" The trick\u2014and both the art and science\u2014is to get the oligonucleotides where they are needed and get them there intact. The practice of isolating and cloning genes provides thepossibility of being able to insert normal copies of genes into people with genetic diseases (gene therapy). \"RX-0201 is a proprietary drug that is completing its \"first-in-man\" studies (phase 1) and is expected to start phase 2later this year,\" points out Steinfels. \"We are looking to improve its pharmaceutical properties, such as its biodistribu- tion and efficacy, through a novel deliverysystem.\" Professor and chair of the School of Pharmacy's Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Natalie Eddington, PhD, isenthusiastic about the potential for new therapies. \"The partnership between the CNCD and Rexahn is extremely exciting.Itwill facilitate the development and evaluation of new technologies for drug delivery and will foster our mission oftraining scientists to combat human dis - eases,\" says Eddington. Another unique aspect of the par tnership is the postdoctoral pr ogram established b y Rexahn. With joint appointments at Rexahn and the School of Pharmacy, thepostdoctoral fellows will be part of the team involved in identifying new and better ways of developing drugs and delivery systems. \"I don't know of any other company taking on postdocs who have an academicmentor,\" says Steinfels. \"The unique joint postdoc is not like an internship where just the students learn. We are going tolearn a lot from them.\" Ghandehari and E ddington have also been given slots on Rexahn's scientific advisory board. \"When we come across questions, we'll have their expertise,\" says Steinfels. \" The par tnership will allo wus to dev elop technology and achieve the developmental milestones more quickly.\" The postdocs, hand picked for the job ,aredrug deliv ery experts. One focuses on using polymers to deliver nucleic acids, while the other works with spherical micelles, nano-scale structures that can incorporate drugs in their protective core. Working with Ghandehari, the postdocs will present Rexahn with delivery strategies. Rexahn, the University, and patients will win. \"Itjust makes sense,\" says G handehari. /boxopen 54 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND, BALTIMORE ILLUSTRATION BY JENNIFER FAIRMAN 2007 RESEARCH & SCHOLARSHIP 55\"The partnership [with the University of Maryland] also provides us with research and develop- ment e xpertise, including technology and a competitiveedge, especially in drug delivery, \" saysGeorge Steinfels. Nucleic acids are potent molecules that can enter a cell to stop the expression of a disease gene. However, without protective binding factors, nucleic acids will rapidly degrade when injected alone into the blood stream. T o be effective, these negatively charged molecules need to bind with positively charged small molecules called nanocarriers(e.g. a liposome or polymer) ( A). These complexes are targeted to and uptaken by cells (process known as endocytosis) ( B-C), and are released within the cell to interrupt disease gene expression ( D-E).For more effective treatment, nano-sized systems of drugs are targeted to the diseased site on the liver.

That sense of discovery, plus rigorous discipline, a little serendipity, and a largedose of luck is what Fasano, a pediatricgastroenterologist and professor of pedi-atrics, medicine, and physiology at theSchool of Medicine, credits with guidinghim to some remarkable discoveries andaccomplishments since moving toBaltimore from Naples, Italy, in 1993. With a scholarship to the School of Medicine's Center for Vaccine Development,he initially explored the causes of acuteand chr onic diarrhea, hoping to find a vaccine for cholera. \"I was listening to what natur ewas tr y- ing to tell me,\" says F asano about the route that took him to \"one discovery after another,\" leading him away from choleraand toward celiac disease and radicalresearch in autoimmune diseases. \"A scientist can think\u2014and then formulate ahypothesis\u2014but nine times out of 10, itgoes in a different direction.\" In2000, F asano and his colleagues discovered zonulin, a protein that regulates the permeability of the intestine. Theydetermined that when z onulin for ces molecules to travel past the natural barriers of the intestine (the tight junctions), it can trigger an autoimmune r esponse that appears to contribute to a number of diseases, such as celiac disease, multiplesclerosis, rheumatoid ar thritis, and possibly type 1 diabetes. \"Dr. Fasano's work represents a para- digm shift in the understanding of tightjunction structure and function in disease,\"says Blake Paterson, MD, chief executiveofficer of Alba Therapeutics Corporation. Paterson founded the company with Fasano in 2004 to transfer the z onulin technology from the lab's bench top to the patient 's bedside. Paterson credits Fasano's \"persuasive- ness, perseverance, and thick skin\u2014alongwith his str ong desir eto improve the quality of patients' lives\"\u2014with the resulting part- nership between academia and industrythat led to the success of the biopharma-ceutical company now headquartered at the UMB B ioPark. Fasano, who resigned as interim chief scientific officer in 2006 to return to academics full-time, is no wchair of the company 's scientific advisory board. Technology dev elopments fr om F asano 's laborator yhaveresulted in mor ethan 150 patents now held by Alba Therapeutics. The company ,named the M aryland Incubator Company of the Year in 2006, has completed clinical and human trials of AT-1001, its lead compound. A T-1001 is targeted to wardthe tr eatment of celiac disease and other autoimmune illnesses. Fasano 'senthusiastic suppor twas also pivotal in enlisting the inv estment backing that led to the closing of a $30 millionSeries A financing for Alba Therapeutics in August 2005. Fasano says the success ofthe biopharmaceutical company would nothavebeen possible without industry back- ing and P resident Ramsay 'ssupport. \"To make discovery a service, you have to have resources\u2014and a University of Marylandpresident who is an entr epreneur ,\" says Fasano . \u2014 Susie F laherty Teacher of the Year Larry Anderson Nodoubt the systematic dissection of a cadav er leav es a lasting impr ession on every first-year medical student.

I want to give them achance to gain some confidence.\" That isno small task for an 11-w eek course in anatomy, histology, and embryology. Before the start of a recent 8 a.m. lectur e, Anderson blar es some music rele- vant Vine.\" \"It helps them towake up and gets the students ex cited about learning,\" Anderson explains. He then launches into a gloves-off, hands-on pr esentation\u2014with props, animation, audiovisuals, and his own brand of humor and drama\u2014to help studentsremember just which artery is which, orwhat size a \"normal\" heart should be.During the laboratory portion of the class,Anderson spends as much one-on-onetime as necessary to make sure his studentsfully understand the concepts. Later heanswers more questions e-mailed by hisstudents, who call his lessons unforgettable.

In 2006,the president added a new category of recognition\u2014the Entrepreneur of the YearAward\u2014to honor a faculty member who shows exceptional creativity and resolve intaking the results of basic research from the lab to the marketplace. Six Illustrious Alumni were also honored and events included a black-tie gala, student cookout, staff luncheon, and research lecture. Alessio Fasano, MD Larry Anderson, PhD Angela Brodie, PhD Rebecca Wiseman, PhD, RNrooms had the Wellmobile service not been available. That translates, she calcu- lates, into a savings of approximately $2million per year in uncompensated hospital care. And though Wellmobiles provide care for many immigrants who do not have access to government assistance, Wiseman says most of the patients are U.S. citizens employed full-time in low-wage jobs. Through Wellmobile outreach, patients learn about their eligibility forstate or federal health care programs. Under Wiseman's direction, says Gov. Robert Ehrlich, the Wellmobile program helps identify \"all the services for which apatient might qualify.\" In addition, he says, Wiseman \"empowers her staff to be involved in their service to the community,\" and she is a \"mentor to those she leads.\" Wiseman is also praised by Delegate Kevin Kelly, a member of the Maryland General Assembly from rural AlleganyCounty .\"Ineach r egion of the state wher e the four Governor's Wellmobiles are situated, Dr. Wiseman conscientiously works inconjunction with local community officialsto provide patient r eferrals, hospital/lab support, and other essential services to uninsur ed individuals,\" Kelly says. On the national front, Wiseman organ- ized the travel of two Wellmobile vans andstaff to B rookhaven, Miss., in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, where 2,000 people were treated over a 10-day period. Wiseman also acquired more than $100,000 indonated supplies to support the relief effort. Wiseman plans to expand the Wellmobiles ' hours to evenings and weekends so that more people who work during the week,especially men, can be helped. S he also plans to pr ovide mor eeducation and care for patients with diabetes, one of the most common diseases among her clients. \"The truth of the matter is that the Wellmobile Program is a true safety netprovider that offers many people the car e they would not hav ebeen able to r eceive elsewhere,\" Wiseman says. \u2014 Mary Spiro Our 2007 gala will be held in late October.

Her pioneering work in the role of estrogens in breast cancer led to the development of the most important therapyused in breast cancer today: aromataseinhibitors. She began her studies on compounds that would block the conversion of andro-gens to estrogen in the early 1970s at theWorcester Foundation in Shrewsbury,Mass. Thereshe and 4-hydroxy- androstenedione ). After relocating laboratory to the School of Medicine'sDepartment of P harmacology and Experimental Therapeutics in 1979, Brodie pursued clinical testing of the drug. Brodie's research has been supported through funding from the NationalInstitutes of Health since 1975. The encouraging r esults of a small clin - ical trial in E ngland led to larger trials and the eventual therapeutic use of aromatase inhibitors to fight breast cancer in post-menopausal women. F ormestane was released for worldwide use in 1994 and became the first new drug in a decadespecifically designed for the treatment of breast cancer. \"Itis rare that one individual can take a drug from the phase of synthesis to ultimate use in patients,\" says Richard Santen, MD, professor of internal medicine and associ-ate director of clinical research at the University of Virginia Health System. \"Dr. Brodie was the first to envision the develop-ment of aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer.\" Brodie was recognized with the top prize in the world for cancer research whenshe received the Charles F .Kettering Prize from the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation in Washington, D.C., in June2005. The $250,000 prize is awarded annually for the most important recent contribution to cancer treatment. The cancer researcher also received the Brinker International Breast Cancer Award for Basic Research from the Susan G. Komen Foundation in 2000 and the Dorothy P .Landon American Association for Cancer Research Prize in 2006. Brodie delivered the annual Founders Week Faculty Research Lecture \"Aromatase Inhibitors and Breast Cancer: Concept to Clinic\" on Oct. 26.

With770,000 M aryland residents lacking health insurance and access to adequate health care, Wiseman is dedicated to bringingbasic, quality health care to as many peopleas possible. The Wellmobiles\u2014four 33-foot-long mobile health units, each with two exam rooms, a reception area, and a basic labora-tory\u2014provide primary health care for theuninsured and underinsured throughoutMaryland. Under Wiseman's leadership,the number of patients seen daily at eachWellmobile van has increased from three tomore than 15, or as many as 8,000 a year. \"As a nurse, I see access to health care as a right,\" she says. \"My job is to give our providers as many resources as possible sothat they can pr ovide the highest lev el of carepossible.\" Tothat end, Wiseman has developed partnerships with local care providers, including specialists and regional hospitals, to establish a networ kof car e and case management for an ever-increasing client load.
