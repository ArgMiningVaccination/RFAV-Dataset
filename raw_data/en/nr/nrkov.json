When We use the term \"Insured Person\" in this Policy, We mean You and any eligible Family Member(s) who are covered u nder this Policy. You and all Family Member(s) cov ered under this Policy are listed on the Policy specification page. The benefits of this Policy are provided only for t hose services that are Medically Necessary as defin ed in this Policy and for which the Insured Person has benefits. The fact that a Physician prescribes or orders a servic e does not, in itself, mean that the service is Medically Necessar y or that the service is a Covered Service. Consult this Policy or phone Us at the number shown on Your Cigna identifi cation card if You have any questions regarding whe ther services are covered. This Policy contains many important terms (such as \"Medically Necessary\" and \"Covered Service\") that a re defined in the section entitled \"Definitions\". Before reading through this Policy, be sure that You understand th e meanings of these words as they pertain to this Policy. We provide coverage to You under this Policy based upon the answers submitted by You and Your Family M ember(s) on Your signed individual application.

Choice of Hospital and Physician : Nothing contained in this Policy restricts or in terferes with an Insured Person's right to select the Hospital or Physician of their choice. However, non-emergency services from a Non- Participating Provider are not covered by this Policy. THIS IS A NETWORK-ONLY POLICY That means this Policy does not provide benefits fo r any services You receive from an Out-of-Network P rovider except: Services for Stabilization and initial treatment o f a Medical Emergency, or Two sessions per Year for the purpose of diagnosis or assessment of mental health, or Medically Necessary services that are not availabl e through an In-Network (Participating) Provider. In-Network (Participating) Providers include Physic ians, Hospitals, and other health care facilities. Check the provider directory, available at www.mycigna.com, or call th e number on Your ID card to determine if a Provider is In-Network (Participating). MOINDEPO082018 Cigna Connect 3700 MIEP0337/MIEP0338/MIEP0340 MIEP0344/MIEP0345/MIEP0347 2 Choosing a Primary Care Physician (PCP) A Primary Care Physician may serve an important rol e in meeting health care needs by providing or arra nging for medical care for each Insured Person. For this reas on, when You enroll as an Insured Person, You will be a sked to select a Primary Care Physician (PCP). Your PCP wil l provide Your regular medical care and assist in c oordinating Your care. You are encouraged to choose a PCP for Y ourself and each covered Family Member from the net work of Participating Providers. You may select Your PCP by calling the customer service phone number on Your ID card or by visiting Our website at www.mycigna.com. The Pri mary Care Physician You select for Yourself may be different from the Primary Care Physician You select for each of your Family Member(s). You have the right to designate any Primary Care Physician who participates in Our network and is available to accept You or Your Fami ly Members. If You do not select a PCP during enrollment or wit hin 31 days of being notified that Your PCP is no l onger Participating with the Plan, We will select a PCP f or You. You may change Your PCP up to once a month by visiting Our website at www.mycigna.com or by contacting Us at the customer service phone number on Your ID car d. Any change in PCP will become effective on the first da y of the month following Your request. If You Need a Specialist Your PCP is important to the coordination of Your c are. While this Policy does not require referrals t o visit specialists, it is very important that You work with Your PCP to help manage Your care and keep Your PCP apprised o f all Your health care needs. Please be aware that obtaining a referral is not itself a guarantee of payment for services. Changing Primary Care Physicians You may request a transfer from one Primary Care Ph ysician to another by contacting Us at the Customer Service number on ID card. Any such transfer will b e effective on the first day of the month following the month in which the processing of the change request is compl eted. In addition, if at any time a Primary Care Physicia n ceases to be a Participating Provider, We will no tify You 30 days in advance, for the purpose of selecting a new Primary Care Physician. If Your PCP Leaves the Network If Your PCP or In-Network specialist ceases to be a Participating Physician, We will notify You in wri ting of his or her impending termination at least 30 days in advance o f the date the PCP leaves the network and provide a ssistance in selecting a new PCP or identifying a new In-Network specialist to continue providing Covered Services. If You are receiving treatment from a Participating Provider a t the time his or her Participating Provider agreem ent is terminated, for reasons other than medical incompet ence or professional misconduct, You may be eligibl e for continued care with that Provider. MOINDEPO082018 Cigna Connect 3700 MIEP0337/MIEP0338/MIEP0340 MIEP0344/MIEP0345/MIEP0347 3 Continuity of Care If Your PCP ceases to be a Participating Physician, We will notify You. Under certain medical circumst ances, We may continue to reimburse Covered Expenses from You r PCP or a specialist You've been seeing at the Par ticipating Provider benefit level even though he or she is no longer affiliated with Cigna's network. If you are undergoing an active course of treatment for an acute or chronic condition and continued treatment is Medically Nece ssary, You may be eligible to receive continuing care from the Non-Participating Provider for a specified time, s ubject to the treating Provider's agreement. You may also be elig ible to receive continuing care if You are in your second or third trimester of pregnancy. In this case, continued car e may be extended through Your delivery and include a period of postpartum care. Such continuity of care must be approved in advance by Cigna, and Your Physician must agree to accept Our reimbursement rate and to abide by Cigna's policies and procedures and quality assurance requirements. There may be additional circumstances where continued care by a Provider who ceases to be a Participating Provid er will not be available, such as when the provider loses his/her license to practice or retires. You may request continuity of care from Cigna after your Participating Provider's termination from Cig na's network; start by calling the toll-free number on your ID ca rd. Continuity of care must be Medically Necessary and approved in advance by Us. Continuity of care will cease upon t he earlier of: \u0001 Successfully transition of Your care to a Particip ating Provider, or \u0001 Completion of Your treatment; or \u0001 The next open enrollment period; or \u0001 The length of time approved for continuity of care ends. Note Regarding Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) Cigna offers some plans that are intended to qualif y as \"high deductible health plans\" (as defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(c)(2)). Plans that qualify as high deductibl e health plans may allow You, if You are an \"eligib le individual\" (as defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 223(c)(1)), to take advantag e of the income tax benefits available when You est ablish an HSA and use the money You deposit into the HSA to pay f or qualified medical expenses as allowed under fede ral tax law. Cigna does not provide tax advice. It is Your responsibility to consult with Your tax advisor or attorney about whether a plan qualifies as a high deductible healt h plan and whether You are eligible to take advanta ge of HSA tax benefits.

Each plan or part of a plan which has the right to coordinate benefits will be considered a separate p lan.

The benefits under the Secondary Plan are reduced based on the benefits under the Primary Plan.

The Allowable Expense is the lesser of: \u0001 the charge used by the Primary Plan in determining the benefits it pays; \u0001 the charge that would be used by this plan in dete rmining the benefits it would pay if it were the Pr imary Plan, and \u0001 the amount of the Covered Expense. If the benefits for a Covered Expense under your Pr imary Plan are reduced because you did not comply w ith the Primary Plan's requirements (for example, getting p re-certification of hospital admission or a second surgical opinion), the amount of the Allowable Expense is re duced by the amount of the reduction. Claim Determination Period A calendar year, but does not include any part of a year during which you are not covered under this p lan or any date before this section or any similar provision t akes effect. Order of Benefit Determination Rules A plan that does not have a coordination of benefit s rule consistent with this section shall always be the Primary Plan. If the plan does have a coordination of benef its rule consistent with this section, the first of the following rules that applies to the situation is the one that applies: \u0001 The plan that covers you as an enrollee or an empl oyee shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that co vers you as a Dependent shall be the Secondary Plan; \u0001 If you are a Dependent child whose parents are not divorced or legally separated, the Primary Plan sh all be the plan which covers the parent whose birthday fal ls first in the calendar year as an enrollee or emp loyee; \u0001 If you are the Dependent of divorced or separated parents, benefits for the Dependent shall be determ ined in the following order: \u0001 first, if a court decree states that one parent is responsible for the child's healthcare expenses or health coverage and the plan for that parent has actual kn owledge of the terms of the order, but only from th e time of actual knowledge; \u0001 then, the plan of the parent with custody of the c hild; \u0001 then, the plan of the spouse of the parent with cu stody of the child; \u0001 then, the plan of the parent not having custody of the child, and \u0001 finally, the plan of the spouse of the parent not having custody of the child. \u0001 The plan that covers you as an active employee (or as that employee's Dependent) shall be the Primary Plan and the plan that covers you as laid-off or re tired employee (or as that employee's Dependent) sh all be the Secondary Plan. If the other plan does not have a similar provision and, as a result, the plans ca nnot agree on the order of benefit determination, this p aragraph shall not apply. \u0001 The plan that covers you under a right of continua tion which is provided by federal or state law shal l be the Secondary Plan and the plan that covers you as an a ctive employee or retiree (or as that employee's Dependent) shall be the Primary Plan. If the other plan does not have a similar provision and, as a re sult, the plans cannot agree on the order of benefit dete rmination, this paragraph shall not apply. \u0001 If one of the plans that covers you is issued out of the state whose laws govern this plan, and deter mines the order of benefits based upon the gender of a pa rent, and as a result, the plans do not agree on th e order of benefit determination, the plan with the gender rules shall determine the order of benefits. If none of the above rules determines the order of benefits, the plan that has covered you for the lon ger period of time shall be primary.

If this plan is the Secondary Plan, the amount this plan pays for a Covered Expense is the Allowable E xpense less the amount paid by the Primary plan during a C laim Determination Period. If while covered under this plan, you are also cove red by another Cigna individual or group plan, you will be entitled to the benefits of only one plan. You may choose this plan or the plan under which you will be covered. C igna will then refund any premium received under the other plan co vering the time period both policies were in effect . However, any claim payments made by Cigna under the plan you ele cted to cancel will be deducted from any such refun d of premium. Recovery of Excess Benefits If this plan is the Secondary Plan and Cigna pays f or Covered Expenses that should have been paid by t he Primary Plan, or if Cigna pays any amount in excess of what it is obligated to pay, Cigna will have th e right to recover the actual overpayment made. Cigna will have sole discretion to seek such recove ry from any person to, or for whom, or with respect to whom, such services were provided or such payments made b y any insurance company, healthcare plan or other organization. No such request will be made more tha n 12 months after date of the actual overpayment ex cept in cases of fraud or misrepresentation by the health c are provider. If we request, you must execute and d eliver to us such instruments and documents as we determine a re necessary to secure the right of recovery.

If no response is received within 90 days of the re quest, the claim will be denied. If the requested i nformation is subsequently received, the claim will be processed. Medicare Eligibles If an Insured Person is eligible for Medicare, Cign a will calculate the claim payment for Covered Serv ices according to the benefit levels of this Policy based on the a llowed amount defined below, and pay this amount mi nus any amount paid by Medicare. Cigna will estimate the amount Medicare would have paid, and and reduce benefits by this amount for an y Insured Person who is eligible to enroll in Medicare but is not enrolled. In no event will the amount paid exc eed the amount that Cigna would have paid if it were the so le insurance carrier. Under this scenario, the allowed amount will be the lesser of: \u0001 The amount Medicare allowed or \u0001 Cigna's Negotiated Rate for a Participating Provid er or \u0001 Cigna's Maximum Reimbursable Charge for a Non Part icipating Provider MOINDEPO082018 Cigna Connect 3700 MIEP0337/MIEP0338/MIEP0340 MIEP0344/MIEP0345/MIEP0347 81 NOTICE OF GRIEVANCE The Grievance provision in this certificate may be superseded by the law of your state if you are not a Missouri resident and if such other state's Grievance provision is mo re favorable than that which is provided in this ce rtificate.
