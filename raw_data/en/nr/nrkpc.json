Cancer Cell International The study describes the current state of knowledge on nanotechnology and its utilization in medicine. The focus in this manuscript was on the properties, usage safety, and potentially valuable applications of chitosan-based nanomaterials. Chitosan nanoparticles have high importance in nanomedicine, biomedical engineering, discovery and development of new drugs. The manuscript reviewed the new studies regarding the use of chitosan-based nanoparticles for creating new release systems with improved bioavailability, increased specificity and sensitivity, and reduced pharmacological toxicity of drugs. Nowadays, effective cancer treatment is a global problem, and recent advances in nanomedicine are of great importance. Special attention was put on the application of chitosan nanoparticles in developing new system for anticancer drug delivery. Pre-clinical and clinical studies support the use of chitosan-based nanoparticles in nanomedicine. This manuscript overviews the last progresses reg... Nanomaterials Chitin (poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) is the second (after cellulose) most abundant organic polymer. In its deacetylated form\u2014chitosan\u2014becomes a very interesting material for medical use. The chitosan nano-structures whose preparation is described in this article shows unique biomedical value. The preparation of nanochitosan, as well as the most vital biomedical applications (antitumor, drug delivery and other medical uses), have been discussed in this review. The challenges confronting the progress of nanochitosan from benchtop to bedside clinical settings have been evaluated. The need for inclusion of nano aspects into chitosan research, with improvisation from nanotechnological inputs has been prescribed for breaking down the limitations. Future perspectives of nanochitosan and the challenges facing nanochitosan applications and the areas needing research focus have been highlighted. Nanomaterials Chitosan nanoparticles are well-known delivery systems widely used as polymeric carriers in the field of nanomedicine. Chitosan is a carbohydrate of natural origin: it is a biodegradable, biocompatible, mucoadhesive, polycationic polymer and it is endowed with penetration enhancer properties. Furthermore, it can be easily derivatized. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents a remarkable health problem because current therapies, that include surgery, liver transplantation, trans-arterial embolization, chemoembolization and chemotherapy, present significant limitations due to the high risk of recurrence, to a lack of drug selectivity and to other serious side effects. Therefore, there is the need for new therapeutic strategies and for improving the liver-targeting to HCC. Nanomedicine consists in the use of nanoscale carriers as delivery systems to target and deliver drugs and/or diagnostic agents to specific organs or tissues. Chitosan and its derivatives can be successfully used i... Journal of the Egyptian Society of Parasitology 2019 Nanoparticles encapsulated with natural venoms have a considerable attention to improve illnesses therapies by overcoming toxic effects secreted by different pathogens. The present study explored conjugation of chitosan extracted from cuticle of naturally died honeybees nanoparticles (B-Cs-NPs) with the honeybee, Apis mellifera venom (BV). Detected related toxicity and anticancer potential of and BV loaded NPs- against Colon (CaCO-2), Larynx cancer cell lines. gelation of chitosan (CS) with sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) was the method used to prepare nanoparticles. Cytotoxic effects of BV and BV loaded NPs nanoparticles against the three cancer cell lines studied, then they were assessed using MTT stain assay. Data recorded revealed that combination of bee venom with bee chitosan nanoparticles enhanced the inhibitory effect against cancer cells studied when compared with bee venom alone. Also, it was cleared that by treating CaCO-2, HEp-2 ... Chitosan is among the most abundant biopolymers on earth and has been either used or exhibited potential in a wide variety of industrial and biomedical applications. With the advancement of materials technologies, chitosan has been chemically modified to self-assemble into nanoarchitectures that are usable in advanced biomedical applications, such as drug nanocarriers, macroscopic injectables, chitosan (AMC) is a relatively recent material receiving increased attention with numerous publications addressing the medical advantages of specific systems. To date, many reviews have focused on the synthesis and biomedical properties of chitosan-based biomaterials, but a comprehensive study focusing on the colloidal properties of AMC in relation to biomedical performance appears to be lacking. This review provides a survey of the field, critically reviewing the colloidal properties and biomedical performance of AMC systems, such as nanoparticle drug delivery systems and macroscopic medical devices. Finally, the future development, market potential, and clinical implications of these promising colloidal-structured biomaterials are summarised. Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society 2014 Over the last decade carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) has emerged as a promising biopolymer for the development of new drug delivery systems and improved scaffolds along with other tissue engineering devices for regenerative medicine that is currently one of the most rapidly growing fields in the life sciences. CMCS is amphiprotic ether, derived biodegradability, osteogenesis ability and numerous other outstanding physicochemical and biological properties. More strikingly, it can load hydrophobic drugs and displays strong bioactivity which highlight its suitability and extensive usage for preparing different drug delivery and tissue engineering formulations respectively. This review provides a comprehensive introduction to various types of CMCS based formulations for delivery of therapeutic agents and tissue regeneration and further describes their preparation procedures and applications in ... Pharmaceutics In recent decades, drug delivery systems (DDSs) based on nanotechnology have been attracting substantial interest in the pharmaceutical field, especially those developed based on natural polymers such as chitosan, cellulose, starch, collagen, gelatin, alginate and elastin. Nanomaterials based on chitosan (CS) or chitosan derivatives are broadly investigated as promising nanocarriers due to their biodegradability, good biocompatibility, non-toxicity, low immunogenicity, great versatility and beneficial biological effects. CS, either alone or as composites, are suitable substrates in the fabrication of different types of products like hydrogels, membranes, beads, porous foams, nanoparticles, in-situ nanofibers/scaffolds. Currently, the CS based nanocarriers are intensely studied as controlled and targeted drug release systems for different drugs (anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, anticancer etc.) as well as for proteins/peptides, growth factors, vaccines,... American Journal of Biomedical Science & Research As mentioned earlier, the encapsulation of ICG in the polymeric construct enhances its physicochemical attributes such as half-life, bioavailability, stability and pharmacokinetic characteristics, and reduces the ease of degradation. Moreover, these versatile ICG-en-capsulated NIR theranostic nanoparticles also offer numerous oth-er advantages such as significant targeting ability and sensitivity in tumor imaging, which facilitate them in exploring other innovative therapeutic applications. Herein, we elaborate on the discussion of ICG encapsulation and its delivery using various ground-breaking polymer nanocomposites with a set of examples. Among various ap-proaches of breast cancer treatment, near-infrared (NIR)-mediated phototherapy is one of the most promising strategies for serving as a supplement to traditional cancer therapies since it can providei Enhanced tissue penetration efficacy as compared with that operated by visible light American Journal of Biomedical Science & Research Indocyanine green (ICG) has been exploited as a photosensitizer for use in cancerous phototherapy including breast, brain, and skin tumors. Although ICG is of particular advantage for use in cancer phototherapy, it adversely tends to disintegrate in aqueous medium and such degradation can be markedly accelerated by light irradiation (photodegradation) and/or heating (thermal degradation). Furthermore, ICG after administered intravenously will be readily bound with blood proteins and hence leads to only 2\u00b14min of plasmatic half-life. Among various pharmaceutical polymers, (PLGA), PEG, Chitosan are the best-defined biomaterials with FDA approval for drug encapsulation due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, and controllability for drug release. This review shows that novel applications of biodegradable polymers as nanocarrier for ICG to improve of physicochemical properties of ICG such as Half-life Adenocarcinoma of the colon is the most common malignant neoplasia of the gastrointestinal tract and is a major contributor to mortality worldwide. Invasiveness and metastatic behavior are typical of malignant tumors and, because of its portal drainage, the liver is the closest capillary bed available in this case, hence the common site of metastatic dissemination. Current therapies forecast total resection of primary tumor when possible and partial liver resection at advanced stages, along with systemic intravenous therapies consisting of chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil. These cures are definitely not exempt from drawbacks and heavy side effects. Biocompatible polymeric networks, both in colloids and bulk forms, able to absorb large quantities of water and load a variety of molecules-belong to the class of innovative drug delivery systems, thus suitable for the purpose and tunable on each patient can represent a promising alternative. Indeed, the implantation of poly... Loading Preview Sorry, preview is currently unavailable. You can download the paper by clicking the button above.
