BACKGROUND Targeted child health interventions may be missed due to a number of reasons. It is the responsibility of all health care providers who encounter children who have missed essential child hea lth interventions such as immunisation , growth monitoring, vitamin A supplementation, deworming among other preventive interventions to ensure that these children receive eligible interventions in an age -appropriate, safe manner. This applies to both the p ublic sector as well as the private sector health providers. The impact of missed interventions is adverse. For example, missed vaccine doses during routine immunisation result in immunity gaps that makes the population susceptible to vaccine preventable disease outbreaks with the resultant morbidity and mortality. When a child misses routine growth monitoring interventions such as weight, height and mid-upper arm circumference measurements as well assessments for bilateral pedal oedema, there is the miss ed opportunity for early detection and intervention in children with moderate acute and severe acute malnutrition (MAM/SAM) that increases their risk of vulnerability to diseases including VPDs. Care -givers are advised to i ntegrate growth and development monitoring, counselling and support for nutrition (including special attention to support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding), at every contact with health services, including during immunisation visits . Missed doses of Vitamin A may result in Vit amin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency cause s visual impairment (night blindness), increase s the risk of illness and mortality from childhood infections such as measles and diarrhoea . Improving the vitamin A status of deficient children through supplemen tation enhances their resistance to disease and can reduce mortality from all causes by approximately 23%. Missed doses of deworming tablets may result in intestinal worm infestation, which can deplete a child's nutritional resources resulting in retarda tion of growth and anaemia. South Africa like other parts of the world has a high prevalence of Soil Transmitted Helminthes, particularly amongst disadvantaged children who live in densely populated rural and under serviced areas such as informal settlemen ts. Worm infestation, if left untreated, can impact negatively on all aspect of a child's development. This includes, health, nutrition, cognitive development, learning and educational access and achievement. Deworming therefore represents a cost -effective intervention. Because of the high risk of death before the age of 2 years among HIV -infected infants and given the increasing availability of paediatric antiretroviral treatment in the country , early virological diagnosis of HIV infection in infants is i mportant as it enables early identification of children who have HIV -infection, as a first step in securing their treatment and care and enables the identification of those who are HIV -exposed but uninfected, facilitating follow -up care and prevention meas ures that will help to ensure that they remain uninfected. The South African PMTCT guidelines recommends that an HIV PCR October 2020 Page 7 of 39 test be conducted at birth, at 10 weeks and 6 months for HIV exposed infants, as well as ARV prophylaxis from birth until the end of br eastfeeding period to further prevent mother to child transmission of HIV during the post -natal period. The guidelines also promote integrated management of the mother -baby pair by aligning PMTCT interventions with BANC visits during antenatal period and E PI visits during postnatal period. As described above, given the adverse implications of missed interventions; it is of utmost importance that all health care workers who encounter children under 5 ; assess the status of missed interventions and provi de them appropriately. 1.1 PURPOSE The purpose of this field guide is to outline the process of catch -up of missed vaccination doses and other key child health interventions. Catch -up refers to the process of providing doses of various interventions and requ ired assessments that would have been missed for any reasons (such as stock outs, service interruptions or reduced demand etc.) 1.2 SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE To describe the principles of catch -up including eligibility assessments, r ecording , re- scheduling , co-admini stration and follow -up process of th e following interventions: Routine immunisation Nutritional assessments Deworming Prevention of Mother -to Child Transmission of HIV (PMTCT) 1.3 SCOPE This filed guide is targeted towards front line health care workers and se nior managers who administer and manage child health programs respectively. This field guide should be adhered to at all health care facilities . This field guide does not replace the currently existing national technical guidance documents; but aims to summarise the key -catch up procedures in a succinct manner. In addition to this filed guide ; staff must adhere to all the following relevant national guideline documents: 1. Vaccinator's Manual (4th Edition, January 2015 ) 2. National EPI schedule 3. Integrated Mana gement of Childhood Illnesses (IMCI) Chart booklet 4. Road to Health Book 5. Infant and Young Child Feeding 6. PMTCT guidelines October 2020 Page 8 of 39 2 IMMUNISATION CATCH -UP 2.1 BACKGROUND EPI-SA was launched in 1994. There are currently eleven antigens in the vacci nation schedule. Immuni sation is offered free of charge at all government health care facilities. The government of SA provides 100% of routine vaccine expenditure. There are over 3000 government facilities offering immunisation in SA. There are also a number of private provider s of immunisation (hospital groups , private pharmacies as well as individual private nurse and doctors) . The public sector routine immunisation schedule is shown below: TABLE 1: SA IMMUNISATION SCHEDULE Age Antigens Birth 1, PCV -IPV-Hib-HBV 2, 14 weeks DTaP -IPV-Hib-HBV 3, , RV 2, PCV 2 6 months Measles 1 9 months PCV3 12 months Measles 2 18 months DTaP -IPV-Hib-HBV 3, PCV3 6 years Td 12 years Td Grade 4 girls, aged 9 years and older HPV 2.2 IMMUNIS ATION CATCH -UP 2.2.1 CHECK FOR MISSED DOSES Missed vaccination doses should be checked upon encounter with any child up to 5 years of age: All children who present to all health facilities for any curative services including hospitalized children or children presenting for elective procedures All children attending Early Childhood Development ( ECD ) centres All children of school -going age at schools All children seeking care in the private sector health facilities All children residing in long term care facilities Street children and other vulnerable children (in informal settlements, children of immigrants, in prisons etc) October 2020 Page 9 of 39 Within the community by ward -based outreach teams pro -actively requesting to review the RtHB o f all children in visited households The most objective method to verify missed doses is by checking the R tHB. In the absence of the R tHB history of vaccination from the care -giver is essential. Where the caregiver account is contrary to what is recorde d in the R tHB; the record in the RTHB takes precedence i.e. if it is not written in the R tHB; it means that it was not administered. If the caregiver cannot recall; and there is no R tHB then judge the doses as missed and assess eligibility for catch -up. NB: In the absence of the RTHB, the caregiver may not recall the exact names of vaccines; but may remember the diseases the vaccines prevent, the age at which the vaccines were administered and the route of administration. This therefore; requires skillful interviewing. If the RTHB is missing; ascertain the reason why and if it cannot be located for various reasons (e.g. lost; burnt etc.) a new R tHB should be issued to all children under 5. Upon checking the RTHB ; note the vaccines that were not recorded i.e. the missed doses for age. Noting the missed doses requires systematically reviewing all the vaccines age by age and dose by dose; chronologically from birth doses to the current age appropriate dose. After the missed doses are noted proceed to determin e eligibility for catch up NB: Some children may present with R tHBs or vaccination cards from the private sector or from other countries. Despite this, the process of systematically checking for missed doses should be followed for every child. If there are challenges in the translation of the vaccination cards , the vaccinators should inform the district/province who will get assistance from the NDOH via various means e.g. WHO . 2.2.2 ASSESSING FOR ELIGIBILITY OF CATCH -UP DOSES Once missed doses are identified per 2.2.1 above ; the next step is to assess which vaccines the child is eligible for catch -up. Eligibility is determined by the upper age limit of the vaccine as well as the direction from the national immunisation schedule . It is important to note that if a child missed a dose they are eligible to receive that dose if the child's age is below the upper age limit for that vaccine based on the manufacture r recommendations as well as the national catch -up schedule (Annexure 1) October 2020 Page 10 of 39 Below is the upper age limit of the vaccines in the public sector EPI schedule per the manufacturer recommendations. TABLE 2: VACCINE UPPER AGE LIMITS Vaccine Upper age limit (per manufacturer) Upper limit per national schedule guideline BCG 12 months 12 mon ths OPV birth dose No upper age limit 6 months DTaP -IPV-Hib-HBV 59 months 59 months RV 24 weeks Measles No upper age limit No upper age limit PCV 72 months 72 months Td No upper age limit 15 years HPV In many cases the child may have missed multiple antigens and therefore may need multiple vaccines to be administered on the same first catch up visit. Vaccines can be safely administered at the same time (always different sites and different syringes and needles for the injectable vaccines ) NB. The measles vaccine that is currently being used in SA should not be co - administered with other vaccines per the advice from the regulatory authorities. Therefore, whe n a child who has missed measles vaccine among other vaccines presents to a health fac ility; the catch -up process should ensure that whenever the measles vaccine is administered; no other vaccines are administered on the same visit and in the preceding or next 4 -week interval. NB: For a child who has missed measles among other antigens; al ways administer measles vaccine first then the other vaccines after the 4-week interval. Annexure 1 indicates the SA immunis ation catch -up schedule Some key principles to note are the following: The minimum interval between doses for vaccines that requir e multiple doses is 4 weeks. This interval should not be less than 4 weeks but can be more than 4 weeks Even if a long time has passed between doses of the same vaccine; it is not necessary to restart the series from the beginning (if a child gets the Hex axim \u00a9 1 at the correct age at 6 weeks and misses all other Hexaxim\u00a9 doses at 10 and 14 weeks and returns to the facility at the age of 5 months; the vaccinator should continue to administer Hexaxim \u00a9 and record it as a seco nd dose of the series even thou gh the interval between the two doses is longer than 4 weeks October 2020 Page 11 of 39 Multiple vaccines may be given at the same time (exception: measles). In all situations the site of administration should be according to the national schedule (right /left) 2.2.3 RECORDING OF THE CATC H-UP DOSES All vaccine doses administered should be recorded appropriately. Recording should be done post administration. All vaccine catch -up doses should be recorded in the RtHB/ vaccination card. Within the R tHB/vaccination card, the administered dose s should be recorded based on the dose number (the first eligible dose is dose 1) regardless of age of the child. For example if a child missed all the Hexaxim \u00a9 doses and attends the health facility for catch -up vaccination at 14 weeks; at that age the ch ild receives the first Hexaxim \u00a9 dose and it should be recorded as Hexaxim \u00a9 1; even though the child is 14 weeks old . Subsequent doses of the same antigen are then recorded chronologically based on dose number If a child missed some doses and is no longer eligible based on a number of factors e.g. age; the space of that vaccine should not be left blank in the R tHB but should be noted as (ineligible due to age) In addition to recording the catch -up doses in the RtHB; these doses should be recorded in the f acility PHC register All catch -up doses of children below the age of one year should be recorded by dose (as explained above) in the facility PHC register All first-year doses administered to children over 12 months of age should not be recorded in the fac ility PHC register but should be recorded in the appropriate tools/ tally sheets as directed by the NDOH. 2.2.4 FOLLOW -UP APPOINTMENTS Post the first catch up visit there may be need for additional visits for additional doses of the series or for booster doses Communicate with the caregiver the catch -up schedule so that they understand why and when they need to return Write the return date clearly in the RTHB and make sure the care giver understands and has noted this date Ensure the date is also recorded using the Ideal Clinic appointment system October 2020 Page 12 of 39 3 NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENTS CATCH -UP 3.1 BACK GROUND When a child misses routine growth monitoring and promotion interventions such as weight, height and mid -upper arm circumference measurements as well assessments for bilateral pedal oedema, there is the missed opportunity for early detection of acute malnutrition and intervention in children. Children who suffer from acute malnutrition and/or bilateral pitting oedema are up to 12 times more likely to die from common illness es than children who are not wasted. Therefore, preventing the disruption of essential nutrition services such as routine growth monitoring and promotion remains key to limiting the burden of morbidity and mortality from this preventable and treatable cond ition1 Episodes of acute malnutrition increase the risk of stunted growth and development. It further contributes to impaired intellectual development, suboptimal adult work capacity and increased risk of diseases in adulthood. The 2016 South African Demog raphic Health Survey showed that 1 in 4 children under -5 (27.4%) are stunted (low height for age), 3% are wasted, and 6% are underweight. Failing to address malnutrition will continue to negatively impact child health, education and subsequent socioecono mic status. Identifying and managing cases of moderate and severe acute malnutrition are key to a child's chances of recovery. The RtHB is an important tool for g rowth monitoring and promotion which is done by assessing the child's measurements (weight, he ight) and plotting of the weight, height and age of child using the growth charts . 1 Prevention, Early Detection and Treatment of Wasting in Children 0 -59 Months through National Health Systems in the Context of COVID -19, United Nations Children's Fund and World Health Organization, New York, 2020.

Or Every 6 months if child is Growing well Length/height -for-age must be done bi-monthly if the child's weight -for- age line is below -2/-3 line or above +2/+3 line. OR Every 6 months if child is growing well Every 6 months Weight for Length/Height chart Weight -for-length must be done monthly if the child's weight for age is < -2/-3 line or > +2/+3 line Or Every 6 months if child is growing well Weight -for-length must be done bi -monthly if the child's weight f or age is < -2/-3 line or > +2/+3 line Or Every 6 months if child is growing well Every 6 months NOTE: Consider all of a child growth charts together, particular if only one of the chart shows a problem . 3.2 NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENTS CATCH UP 3.2.1 CHECK FOR MI SSED ASSESSMENTS The most objective method to verify growth monitoring assessments is by checking the RtHB when the last the child was weighed, height taken, and plotted of the weight and height and the interpretation of the growth curve and the MUAC taken . 3.2.2 MISSED NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENTS Assess and classify all under -5 children for acute malnutrition. Look for signs of acute malnutrition Assess all the children below 5 years of age for oedema of both feet (bilateral pedal pitting oedema) October 2020 Page 14 of 39 Assess all th e children for OEDEMA of both feet (bilateral pedal pitting oedema) . Bilateral pedal pitting oedema is the retention of water in the tissues of the body. Children presenting with bilateral pedal pitting oedema must be referred to the local health clinic fo r further assessment and management. Measure the mid -upper arm circumference (MUAC) MUAC is used for children 6 to 59 months. If the birth date is unconfirmed, use the recall of the mother/caregiver to estimate the infant's age. MUAC is the circumfe rence of the mid -upper arm. This measurement is a quick and simple way to determine whether or not a child over the age of 6 months is malnourished. MUAC is always taken on the left arm 3.2.3 RECORDING OF THE MISSED NUTRI TIONAL ASSESSMENT The MUAC measurem ent should be recorded in the RtHB/ clinic card.

October 2020 Page 16 of 39 4 VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION CATCH -UP 4.1 BACKGROUND The National Food Consumption Survey, which was conducted in 1999 among children aged 1 -9 years, found t hat one out of two children had a vitamin A intake of less than half the recommended level. Children who are vitamin A deficient suffer an increased risk of death and illness, particularly measles and diarrhea. Providing Vitamin A supplements to children w ho need them improves their vitamin A status, increases their resistance to disease, reduces the severity of illnesses and the length of hospital stays, and improves their chances for survival, growth and development. Because V itamin A can be stored in the liver, it is sufficient to give high doses once every 6 months through oral supplements for prevention . The public sector routine vitamin A supplementation schedule is shown below: TABLE 5: SA VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION PREVENTATI VE SCHEDULE Target group Dosage Schedule All infants 6 to 11 months 100 000 IU (1 blue capsule) A single dose at the age of 6 months (or up to 11 months) All children 12 to 60 months 200 000IU (1 red or yellow capsule) A single dose at 12 month and then every 6 months until 60 months 4.2 VITAMIN A CATCH UP 4.2.1 CHECK FOR MISSED VITAMIN A DOSES Missed Vitamin A supplementation doses should be checked upon encounter with any child 6 months until 59 months of age: at every immunisation contact who present to al l health facilities for any curative services including hospitalized children or children presenting for elective procedures attending Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres seeking care in the private sector health facilities residing in long term care facilities October 2020 Page 17 of 39 Street children and other vulnerable children (in informal settlements, children of immigrants, in prisons etc) Within the community by ward -based outreach teams pro -actively requesting to review the RTHB of all under -5 children in visited hous eholds 4.2.2 ASSESSING FOR ELIGIBILITY If the child is between 6 months and 60 months old, check the Road to Health Booklet or Chart to see when the last v itamin A supplementation dose was recorded and the child's age. Give a single dose if the child: 100 000 IU if the child is between 6 and 11 months of age and has missed the routine dose 200 000 IU if the child is between 12 months and 60 months of age and has not had a dose in the previous 6 months and Has missed the routine dose. Is due for a routine d ose. NOTE: According to WHO, the minimum interval between doses of v itamin A is one month and the maximum interval between doses is 6 months. Annexure 2 indicates the SA Vitamin A supplementation catch -up schedule . Some key principles to note are the f ollowing; If the child has missed more than one (1) dose only give one (1) dose and follow the routine dose intervals. For example, if a child received the vitamin A supplementation dose at 18 months and missed all other vitamin A doses at 24, 30 and 36 mo nths. If the child is presented at 42 months, the health workers should administer a single dose 200 000IU vitamin A and record it, and tell the caregiver to return after 6 months for the next routine dose. 4.2.3 RECORDING OF THE CATCH -UP Vitamin A supplement ation doses administered should be recorded in the RtHB/ clinic card post administration, based on the dose and eligible age of the child. In addition to recording the catch -up doses in the RtHB; these doses should be recorded in the facility PHC register. For example, if a child missed all vitamin A doses and attends the health facility for catch -up vitamin A at 36 months; at that age the child receives a single dose of vitamin A and it should be recorded; even though the child is 36 months old, and the n ext routine dose will be given six months later. October 2020 Page 18 of 39 If a 12 months and older child has missed a dose, always ensure that there is at least a 4 weeks' interval before the next date of routine dose 4.2.4 FOLLOW -UP APPOINTMENTS Post the first catch up visit there may be need for additional visits for additional routine doses. Communicate with the caregiver the routine schedule so that they understand why and when they need to return and write t he return date clearly in the Rt HB. October 2020 Page 19 of 39 5 DEWORMING CATCH -UP 5.1 BACKGROUND Many c hildren are infested with worms, which, may interfere with their health and nutrition, so deworming treatment should be given routinely. Preventive chemotherapy (deworming) - a single -dose treatments are safe, convenient and effective, and should be given to all children between one and five years of age every six months. Deworming is offered free of charge at all government health care facilities. The public sector routine deworming s chedule is shown below: TABLE 6: SA DEWORMING SCHEDULE Age Mebendazole Suspension 100 mg tablet 500 mg tablet (100 mg per 5 ml) 12 months 5 ml twice a day for 3 days One tablet twice a day for 3 days 18 months 5 ml twice a day for 3 days One tablet twice a day for 3 days 24 to 59 month s 25 ml stat *5 tablets stat One tablet stat Age OR Albendazole Suspension 200 mg tablet 400 mg tablet (20 mg per ml) 12 months 10 ml stat One tablet Half a tablet stat 18 months 10 ml stat One tablet stat Half a tablet stat 24 to 59 months 20 ml stat Two tablets stat One tablet stat 5.2 DEWORMING CATCH -UP 5.2.1 CHECK FOR MISSED DEWORMING DOSES The most objective method to verify missed deworming doses is by checking the RtHB. 5.2.2 ASSESSING FOR ELIGIBILITY If the child is between 12 and 59 months old , check the child's RtHB or booklet to see when the child last received deworming medication. Give a single dose if the child: is between one and five years of age and has not had a dose in the previous 6 months and October 2020 Page 20 of 39 has missed their routine dose is due for a routine dose Give either Mebendazole or Albendazole (depending on what is avaialable in your area). Mebendazole is available in 100mg and 500mg tablets, as well as a suspension (liquid ) Albendazole comes in 200mg and 400mg tablets, and in a suspensi on. The Albendazole 400mg tablets are scored (marked with a line in the middle) and can be broken in half along the line. Some tablets are chewable and some must be swallowed (with water). Make sure that you are familiar with the type of medication that is used in your area. Always make sure that the medicine has not expired. The correct dose depends on the age of the child and is shown in the table below. Measure 5 ml using a measuring spoon or syringe. TABLE 7: DEWORMIN G MEDICATION UPPER AGE LIMIT. Medication Upper limit per national schedule guideline Mebendazole100mg bd x 3days 23 months Mebendazole stat 23 months Albendazole 400mg 59 months Annexure 2 indicates the SA deworming catch -up schedule Some key principle to note are the following: Even if a long time has passed between doses of deworming medication, it is not necessary to restart the series from the beginning . For example, if a child gets the deworming medication at the correct age at 18 months and misses all other deworming doses at 24, 30 and 36 months, and returns to the facility at the age of 42 months, the health worker should continue to administer deworming medication and record it , the next routine dose will b e after six months. 5.2.3 RECORDING OF THE CATCH -UP DOSES Deworming doses administered should be recorded in the RTHB/ clinic card post administration , based on the dose and eligible age of the child. In addition to recording the catch up doses in the RTHB; th ese doses should be recorded in the facility PHC register . October 2020 Page 21 of 39 For example , if a child missed all deworming doses and attends the health facility for catch -up deworming at 36 w eeks; at that age the child receives stat dose of either Albendazole 400mg OR Meb endazole 500mg and it should be recorded; even though the child is 36 weeks old , and the next routine dose will be given six months later. If a 12 months and older child has missed a dose, always ensure that there is at least 4 weeks interval before the ne xt date of routine dose. 5.2.4 FOLLOW -UP APPOINTMENTS Post the first catch up visit there may be need for additional visits for additional routine doses . Communicate with the caregiver the routine schedule so that they understand why and when they need to ret urn and w rite the return date clearly in the RTHB .

Whilst significant progress has been made in preventing HIV infect ions in children, HIV remains the third leading cause of maternal mortality, and a significant contributor to under -five deaths in SA. Therefore, managing the health of women living with HIV and preventing mother -to-child transmission of HIV remains a crit ical intervention for ensuring that women and children survive and thrive in South Africa. Antiretroviral prophylaxis and HIV PCR testing have been part of the PMTCT guidelines since the start of the program. The guidelines have evolved over time with more robust regimens being introduced as well as additional monitoring for both mothers and their infants. TABLE 8: SA HIV TESTING AND EARLY INFANT DIAGNOSIS SCHEDULE Age Test / Actions Birth HIV-PCR for all HIV exposed infants 3-6 days Follow up results from birth PCR and manage accordingly 6 weeks Ensure that birth PCR and mother's VL results were checked and acted on 10 weeks HIV-PCR for all HIV exposed infants who previously tested HIV -PCR negative 6 months HIV-PCR for a ll HIV exposed uninfected infants AND establish the HIV status of all infants with unknown exposure (HIV rapid test for the infant if the mother is absent and HIV test for the mother) 18 months Universal HIV testing at 18 months (HIV rapid test for ALL In fants regardless of HIV exposure except those who are known positive prior to testing) confirmatory PCR tests for infants who will test positive Other tests Do an age appropriate HIV test 6 weeks post cessation of breastfeeding even if breastfeeding extends beyond 18 months. Test a symptomatic child according to IMCI guidelines . October 2020 Page 23 of 39 6.2 PMTCT CATCH -UP 6.2.1 CHECK FOR MISSED HIV TESTING AND EARLY INFANT TESTING Missed HIV testing and early infant testing should be checked upon encounter with any child up to 2 ye ars of age: All children who present to all health facilities for any preventative and curative services including hospitalized children or children presenting for elective procedures All children attending Early Childhood Development (ECD) centres All chi ldren of school -going age at schools All children seeking care in the private sector health facilities All children residing in long term care facilities Street children and other vulnerable children (in informal settlements, children of immigrants, in pri sons etc) Within the community by ward -based outreach teams pro -actively requesting to review the RTHB of all children in visited households The most objective method to verify missed HIV testing is by checking the RTHB In the absence of the RTHB, the mo ther's HIV status is important. If the mother has a known HIV positive status or recently (at current visit) tested HIV negative AND is breastfeeding, then infant's exposure can be assessed Where the caregiver account is contrary to what is recorded in th e RTHB; the record in the RTHB takes precedence . If the care giver cannot recall; and there is no RTHB then assume the infant is HIV exposed and high risk and proceed accordingly Upon checking the RTHB; note the HIV tests and early infant diagnosis opport unities missed. Noting the missed HIV tests requires systematically checking both the HIV exposure, testing and prophylaxis of the infant over 24 months. After the missed testing opportunities are noted proceed to determine eligibility for catch up 6.2.2 ASSES SING FOR ELIGIBILITY Once missed HIV testing opportunities are identified; the next step is to assess whether the child is eligible for catch -up. Eligibility is determined by the infant's HIV exposure and/or age October 2020 Page 24 of 39 TABLE 9: AGE BRACKETS FOR EARLY INFANT DIAGNOSIS Age for HIV test (according to the PMTCT testing algorithm) Age bracket for early infant HIV diagnosis Recommendation if missed Birth Birth - 6 weeks HIV-PCR for all HIV exposed infants 10 weeks 7 - 16 weeks HIV-PCR for all HIV exposed infants who previously tested HIV -PCR negative 6 months 17 - 30 weeks HIV-PCR for all HIV exposed uninfected infants Suggestion: 7 - 17 months - PCR test for all exposed uninfected infants 18 months 18 months Universal HIV tes ting at 18 months (HIV rapid test for ALL Infants regardless of HIV exposure) Other tests Symptomatically or 6 weeks post breastfeeding cessation Follow the age appropriate algorithm In many cases the child may have missed multiple HIV testing opportun ities Only one HIV test is required for those infants missing one or more HIV testing opportunities. Infants under 18 months can follow the normal HIV testing algorithm for HIV exposed and unexposed infants Infants who missed the 18 months HIV test shou ld be tested for HIV using a rapid test at any clinical or outreach opportunity (i.e. current visit) Some key principles to note are the following: The HIV exposure and risk of the infant should be assessed, ensure high risk infants are on prophylaxis (ris k determined by mother's ART and VL, infant feeding and maternal high risk behaviours) The mother should be managed along with the infant to ensure minimal risk and infection to the infant 6.2.3 RECORDING OF THE CATCH -UP TESTING All infant and child HIV testing should be recorded appropriately. Recording of HIV testing is according to the NIDs parameters and includes HIV testing for children over 12 months Infant HIV testing should be appropriately recorded in the RTHB October 2020 Page 25 of 39 All HIV tests should be recorded in the ap propriate registers (HIV testing, well baby register etc.) For HIV PCRs all results should be followed up and confirmatory tests done according to the PMTCT guidelines 6.2.4 FOLLOW -UP APPOINTMENTS After the appropriate HIV test is conducted (noting that all inf ants at 18 months require an HIV diagnosis irrespective of exposure and risk) Communicate with the caregiver follow up testing required according to the PMTCT early infant diagnosis and HIV testing algorithm so that they understand when they need to return Write the return date clearly in the RTHB October 2020 Page 26 of 39 7 SAFETY & CO-ADMINISTERING CATCH -UP INTERVENTIONS Ensuring the safety of children during administration of all interventions is key. All health care workers who administer any intervention should be adequately trained Some key safety considerations for deworming: Only chewable deworming tablets should be given to children under 5 years of age. For children under 3 years of age, tablets should be broken and crushed between two spoons, then water added to help ad minister the tablets Do NOT force a child to swallow the mixture Do NOT hold the child's nose to make him/her swallow DO let the child go home untreated if administration is unsuccessful; he/she will be treated during the next round In instances where a c hild requires multiple administration of interventions e.g. deworming tablets, injectable vaccine and Vitamin A. As a matter of principle start with the least invasive and least painful. I.e. Always start with the oral doses before injectables. IN GENER AL THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPLE SHOULD BE FOLLOWED: Start by administering the least painful or least invasive intervention first. Never give the injectable vaccine before the oral medication because there is increased risk of chocking if a crying child has ora l medication administered to them.
