It combines low-carb and ketogenic diets to promote weight loss, improved energy levels, and a healthier lifestyle. Improved Digestion Increased Energy Weight and Fat Loss The Dubrow Diet recommends cutting back on processed foods, sweets, and carbs while increasing lean protein, healthy fats, and non-starchy vegetables. The diet can be important for those seeking a healthier lifestyle with lower-carb options. The benefits of the Dubrow Diet include weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, increased energy levels, better mental clarity, and improved digestion. By focusing on nutrient-dense, whole foods and limiting processed and sugary foods, the Dubrow Diet can help improve overall health and wellness. The Terry Dubrow Plan is a hybrid of the ketogenic and intermittent fasting diets. On a ketogenic diet, you cut off all forms of carbohydrate intake. Dieters who practice intermittent fasting go without eating for extended periods. The Dubrow diet combines these two eating plans to create healthy, low-carb options. What Is a Dubrow Diet? The Dubrow Keto Fusion Diet promotes weight loss, improved energy levels, and overall health and wellness by limiting what someone eats, when they eat, and how much. There are two main parts of the Dubrow Diet; the 16:8 Intermittent Fating and the Full-day Fast. 16:8 Intermittent Fasting: Dieters eat only during an 8-hour window each day, followed by a 16-hour fast. - Full-Day Fast: Dieters delay eating for 24 hours, then resume regular eating habits. The Dubrow Diet follows the idea that modern diets high in processed foods and sugar contribute to many health issues and that a diet focused on nutrient-dense, whole foods can help improve overall wellness. This [diet plan](https://www.athleticinsight.com/diet) triggers the body's metabolic shift into a state of ketosis, which burns fat for energy instead of glucose. What Is the History of a Dubrow Diet? Heather and Terry Dubrow are the creators of the Dubrow diet. As a husband and wife team who are reality TV stars and wellness experts, the couple wanted to find a more sustainable diet than keto. They first introduced the diet in 2018 with the publication of their book, \"The Dubrow Diet: Interval Eating to Lose Weight and Feel Ageless.\" The couple developed the Dubrow Diet due to their personal experiences with diet, wellness, and plastic surgery. Heather and Terry noticed that many patients who underwent weight loss surgery struggled with maintaining their weight loss. They saw the need for a more sustainable and health-promoting approach to diet and lifestyle. The Dubrow Diet quickly gained popularity due to its emphasis on whole, nutrient-dense foods and its use of intermittent fasting to support weight loss. The diet has been widely adopted by people looking to improve their overall health and has received positive reviews from many diet and wellness experts. How Does the Dubrow Diet Work? The Dubrow Diet triggers the body's metabolic shift into a state of ketosis, which burns fat for energy instead of glucose. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the Dubrow Diet works in the body. - Limiting Carbohydrates: Reducing carbohydrates burns fat stores for energy instead of glucose. - Increasing Fat Intake: Healthy fats provide energy and support the body's metabolic shift into ketosis. - Consuming Moderate Protein: High-quality protein supports muscle mass and maintains a healthy metabolism. - Intermittent Fasting: Time-restricted eating reduces insulin levels and improves overall metabolic function. When the body enters a state of ketosis, the diet targets the liver and other organs, including the brain, muscles, and heart, for increased energy production. The body's initial reaction to the Dubrow Diet may include increased energy, improved mental clarity, and reduced cravings for sugar and processed foods. It may take two to three weeks to see significant results, such as weight loss and higher energy levels. What are the Phases in the Dubrow Diet? The Dubrow Diet consists of three phases, each focusing on weight loss and maintenance to sustainability. These three phases are the \"Red Carpet Ready\" phase, the \"Summer is Coming\" phase, and the \"Look Hot While Living Like a Human\" phase. - Phase 1 - \"Red Carpet Ready\": The first phase can help jumpstart weight loss and set the foundation for the following stages. During this phase, dieters should follow a strict low-carb, high-fat, and moderate-protein diet and incorporate intermittent fasting into their routine. This phase typically lasts 2-4 weeks and emphasizes the consumption of nutrient-dense, whole foods, such as non-starchy vegetables, healthy fats, and high-quality protein sources. - Phase 2 - \"Summer Is Coming\": The second phase of the Dubrow Diet focuses on stabilization and maintaining weight loss. During this phase, dieters complete a slightly less restrictive version of the diet, allowing for a limited number of low-carbohydrate foods, such as berries and starchy vegetables. This phase also continues to emphasize the importance of intermittent fasting and the consumption of nutrient-dense, whole foods. - Phase 3 - \"Look Hot While Living Like a Human\": The final phase of the Dubrow Diet is for a sustainable, long-term approach to diet and wellness. During this phase, dieters should balance their dietary habits and lifestyle while prioritizing whole, nutrient-dense foods and intermittent fasting principles. The focus of this phase is to maintain weight loss and overall health and wellness while allowing for some flexibility in food choices. What Are The Health Benefits of The Dubrow Diet?
