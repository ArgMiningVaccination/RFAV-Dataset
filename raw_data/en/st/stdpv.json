House of Representatives Passes H.R. 733!Hundreds of Pancreatic Cancer Action Network advocates have gathered in Washington, D.C. for the past several years for our annual Pancreatic Cancer Advocacy Day. As you will see on page 5 in this issue, our 2012 event was the most highly attended to date, with nearly 650 advocates reaching out to educate their members of Congress about pancreatic cancer and the need to increase research efforts for this disease. Thousands more supported their efforts through the 2012 National Call-In, generating additional momentum for the cause. It is important to remember that advocacy comes in many forms. In addition to educating members of Congress about pancreatic cancer, supporters ensure that scientists studying the disease have sufficient funding, educate patients and families so that they can make informed decisions, and bring entire communities together across the country with a sense of common purpose at special events such as PurpleStrides. Our efforts as advocates for the pancreatic cancer community stand out because we are passionate, dedicated and strategic in our approach. More people are getting involved every day in our movement. You will read many amazing stories of triumph and commitment in this edition of Outreach. As Pancreatic Cancer Awareness Month begins in November, we are especially grateful to all of our supporters. You are to be applauded for your efforts on behalf of the tens of thousands affected by pancreatic cancer in the United States. Let's work to encourage even more people to join us during November for this important cause. By increasing the number of people committed to the fight, we can move closer to reaching our goal of doubling the survival rate for pancreatic cancer by 2020. Please go to www.pancanvision.org to watch a video about how your efforts are making a difference and to find out how you and your family and friends can become advocates for the cause during awareness month!

This alarming finding appeared in a report the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's Research and Scientific Affairs team compiled in August 2012 based on information obtained from published scientific literature. Go to www.pancan.org/report to read the full text of the report. Why is this happening? The projections for the rising number of new cases and number of cancer deaths in the coming years involve three different factors: 1. Demographics of the U.S. The U.S. population will grow and will age over the next 20 years. The good news is that we are living longer, so a greater portion of Americans will be over the age of 65. The not-so-good news is that these older Americans will be at greater risk of getting cancer of any type, including pancreatic. In addition, the proportion of minorities in the population will also change, impacting the risk of certain groups for developing cancer. 2. Changes in the rate at which new cases of cancer are being diagnosed. The number of new cases of cancer that are diagnosed per 100,000 people is known as the incidence rate. The incidence rate for cancer in general is decreasing slightly for men, reflecting primarily a decrease in the number of smoking-related cancers. However, the incidence rate of pancreatic cancer is increasing for both men and women. Experts estimate that some of this increase is due to the rising incidence of obesity in the U.S., but there are other unknown factors that are contributing to this steady increase in pancreatic cancer. 3. Changes in cancer deaths. Information on the cause of deaths of Americans is collected regularly by the Center for Disease Control, which tracks any increases or decreases in the number of deaths per 100,000 people. The good news is that the death rate from cancer in general is decreasing, reflecting advances in the prevention, early diagnosis, and/or treatment of cancer. Unfortunately, pancreatic cancer has not benefited from these advances, and the death rate for pancreatic cancer is increasing slightly for both men and women. Putting it all together. When we combined information on the demographic changes in the U.S. population, and the rates of incidence and deaths, we drew the conclusion shown in the figure below. Pancreatic cancer is the only one of the current top five cancer killers for which both the incidence rate and the death rate are increasing, and therefore is the only one for which the number of deaths is projected to continue to increase. Since the number of deaths from breast and colorectal cancer are decreasing, pancreatic cancer is projected to overtake them as a cause of cancer death sometime before 2020 and become second only to lung cancer. What can we do? The good news is that we are not powerless to change these statistics. While the shifting demographics in the U.S. are not readily changeable, increased focus and resources devoted toward pancreatic cancer research can and will make an impact on the rate at which people lose their lives to this disease. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is committed to maintaining our comprehensive strategy to raise awareness, support patients, privately fund research, and pass legislation to ensure that a comprehensive, long-term plan of action is in place to provide the necessary resources and infrastructure to support the fight against this disease. PAnCREATIC CAnCER PROjECTE d TO MOVE TO THE sECO nd lEAdIng C AUsE Of CAnCER dEATH 2 Fall 2012 OUTREACHDr. Der received the Tempur-Pedic\u00ae Retailers - Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Innovative Grant in 2012. He currently serves as the Sarah Graham Kenan Professor of Pharmacology at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Der received his PhD from the University of California at Irvine and completed his postdoctoral studies at Harvard University Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He has published more than 280 research papers, served on numerous editorial boards, is a consultant for several pharmaceutical companies, and has been a member of Pancreatic Cancer Action Network - AACR Scientific Review Committees to select previous years' grant recipients. Dr. Der describes himself as a \"late arriver\" to the field of pancreatic cancer, having studied the disease for the past 4 to 5 years. Prior to focusing on pancreatic cancer, he dedicated the previous 30 years of his career to studying a protein family called Ras and its general role in cancer. In fact, Dr. Der was part of the original scientific team in the early 1980s to discover that human cancers can contain the Ras oncogene, a protein that directly accelerates tumor growth. Recently, Dr. Der reached a crossroads in his career where he felt it would be best to refocus his laboratory efforts on studying one particular type of cancer while continuing to pursue studies of Ras. Pancreatic cancer was the natural choice, since a type of Ras known as K-Ras is mutated and critical to the formation and progression of more than 90 percent of pancreatic tumors. For his 2012 Pancreatic Cancer Action Network Innovative Grant, generously funded by Tempur-Pedic\u00ae and its valued retailers, Dr. Der proposes to therapeutically target proteins \"downstream\" of K-Ras signaling. Rather than try to directly block K-Ras, which has proven to be an elusive target, Dr. Der will attempt to turn off protein signaling that is activated by K-Ras. He is also planning on staying a step ahead of the cancer cells, trying to predict and circumvent any potential resistance mechanisms that could threaten the effectiveness of this proposed treatment strategy. While Dr. Der's decision to study pancreatic cancer turned out to fit him scientifically, he later realized this area is a philosophical fit for him as well. Primarily through his interaction with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, Dr. Der has had the opportunity to spend time with survivors, caregivers and individuals who have lost loved ones to the disease, reinforcing his decision to join the fight against pancreatic cancer. This choice became especially clear to him when he attended the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's annual Pancreatic Cancer Advocacy Day in Washington, D.C. in June 2012. Dr. Der still wears his purple wristband from the event and remains dedicated to supporting legislation proposed by our organization. \"I found it extremely motivating when many volunteers approached me there and thanked me for the work I am doing in my laboratory,\" he said.MEET A gRAnTEE CHAnnIng dER, PHd: sTAyIng A sTEP AHEAd Of PAnCREATIC CAnCER CElls \"We were pleased to recently fund another Pancreatic Cancer Action Network research grant to move us closer to improving the survival rate and ultimately finding a cure. We fully support the organization's comprehensive approach to combating this insidious disease. To that end, we are thrilled that with this award we have now funded a Pathway to Leadership, Career Development, and Innovative Grant, representing the entire range of multi-year research grants the organization offered through 2012.\" \u2014 Rick Anderson, President of Tempur-Pedic \u00ae North America, LLC Channing Der, PhD Rick AndersonFall 2012 OUTREACH 3The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network will award more than $4 million to research through its 2013 grants program, representing the largest annual total distributed by the organization to date. In the decade since our grants program's inception in 2003, 80 grants have been awarded for a sum of more than $12.7 million. A major goal of our research grants program is to build and strengthen the community of scientists and clinicians committed to fighting the disease. During the past decade, our grants have been administered by the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), the oldest and largest scientific organization in the world focused on cancer, to ensure that the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network funds the most meritorious research projects without any bias. This year, we are pleased to introduce a new grant mechanism: the Research Acceleration Network grant, or RAN. The RAN grant is our largest yet, providing an unprecedented sum of $1 million for collaborative and especially innovative research efforts. The RAN grant was designed with a razor-sharp focus on our goal to double the pancreatic cancer survival rate by 2020. Our remaining investment for this year will fund preexisting grant mechanisms aimed at growing the research community by two main strategies: attracting and retaining earlier career scientists to and in the field (Pathway to Leadership, Fellowship, and Career Development Awards), and supporting out-of-the-box ideas and drawing new experts from other disciplines to focus on pancreatic cancer (Innovative Grants). These approaches remain critical to building and sustaining a strong foundation of researchers dedicated to the disease, and permitting further growth and expansion of our knowledge about pancreatic cancer. In addition to research funds, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network offers grant recipients considerable professional and career development opportunities through our Community for Progress program. The aim of these mentorship and professional activities is to foster collaborations amongst scientists, build future scientific leaders, and strengthen the pancreatic cancer research community.

The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network proudly served as the lead supporter of this important meeting. The AACR refers to such special conferences as presenting \"unique opportunities to interact with the world's leading experts and discuss the latest findings in rapidly developing areas of cancer research. Conferences are relatively small to allow ample time for discussion and networking. The formal and informal discussions at these conferences lead to new collaborations among investigators around the world and major advances in knowledge.\" The pancreatic cancer conference fit the bill. The conference, titled Pancreatic Cancer: Progress and Challenges, marked an important moment for the community of scientists and clinicians studying the disease. A total of 450 attendees registered for the meeting, which exceeded expectations and reflected the growth and momentum now occurring in this field of study. Several attendees commented on the impressive \"quality and quantity\" of the science presented. The camaraderie and spirit of collaboration in the pancreatic cancer community were also evident at the gathering. Many current and past research grant recipients of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network and Scientific and Medical Advisory Board members were prominently featured among organizers, presenters and attendees at the conference. In addition, several volunteers and survivors affiliated with our organization attended. A moving speech by survivor Stu Jed of Reno, Nevada at the opening plenary session was well received and cited several times by scientific presenters during the conference.\"Both [my wife] Ginnie and I found the conference stimulating, encouraging and awe inspiring,\" Stu said. \"We thoroughly enjoyed listening to and socializing with the brilliant researchers who showed us such warmth and hospitality.\" As a testament to the caliber of research presented, the AACR issued 12 press releases highlighting scientific findings shared at the meeting. The topics publicized included risk factors for pancreatic cancer, new diagnostic strategies, and early studies on promising new treatment modalities. Most of the studies presented at the meeting are considered preliminary, but revealed several important topics of study with high potential for future clinical benefit. Among the promising types of investigations taking place in the field of pancreatic cancer is research directed at the protein K-Ras. For an example of a research project aimed at targeting this protein that is critical to the development and progression of pancreatic cancer, please see the article featuring Channing Der, PhD, on page 2. Additionally, the clinical trials involving immunotherapy described on page 6 were all initiated from laboratory studies such as those presented at the special conference, and appear to offer an exciting new strategy that may be used to tackle this difficult disease. \"In all, the AACR pancreatic cancer special conference was a tremendous success, and representative of the high level of energy and productivity currently in the field of pancreatic cancer research,\" said Lynn Matrisian, PhD, the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network's Vice President of Scientific and Medical Affairs. sPECIAl COnfEREnCE dEVOTEd EXClUsIVEly TO P AnCREATIC CAnCER REsEARCH EXCEEds A TTEnd AnCE EXPECTATIOns Scientists gather at a networking reception hosted by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. Fall 2012 OUTREACH 5On September 19, 2012, the U.S. House of Representatives passed, without opposition, an amended version of the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act - our chief legislative priority. The newly named Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act (H.R. 733) will require the National Cancer Institute (NCI) to create a long-term plan, or scientific framework, for pancreatic and other deadly cancers that includes evaluating its current efforts in studying the disease and making recommendations on ways to accelerate progress and improve outcomes. The passage of this bill in the House represents an unprecedented milestone in the history of pancreatic cancer. Never before has a bill dedicated to putting a greater focus on pancreatic cancer and other similarly deadly cancers gotten this far in Congress. There is no doubt that the impetus for moving this legislation forward, especially at a time of partisan gridlock on Capitol Hill, was due to the extraordinary bi-partisan support that our advocates around the country helped to generate for the bill. As lead bill sponsor, Representative Anna Eshoo said just after the bill passed, \"With 293 bi-partisan co-sponsors, I'm exceedingly proud of the pancreatic cancer advocates around the country who helped to make this bill a reality.\" To ensure the bill moved forward, we worked in good faith with the bill sponsors to make modifications to the bill and to address concerns of members of Congress, third parties and those at the NCI. For example, to alleviate concerns about the \"disease-specific\" nature of the legislation, the bill was renamed and expanded to include other deadly, or recalcitrant, cancers (i.e. those with a five-year relative survival rate of less than 50 percent). Some terminology in the bill was also modified such as changing the name of the strategic plan to a \"scientific framework.\" The bill still needs to be passed by the Senate and signed by the President to become law. The Senate could consider the bill after the presidential election when Congress is back in session. We need you to take two more important steps to help our efforts. Thank your Representative for passing H.R. 733 and write to your Senators urging them to pass the bill before the end of the year! To do so, please visit www.pancan.org/TakeAction.

PAnCREATIC CAnCER BIll Cl EARs KEy HURdlE In COngREss This past June, nearly 650 advocates from 49 states attended the sixth annual Pancreatic Cancer Advocacy Day in Washington, D.C. By far, the gathering drew the largest crowd ever to attend the event and demonstrated to Congress the passion and commitment of our community. As a result of the combined efforts of Advocacy Day and the National Call-In, our advocates reached all 100 U.S. Senators and 371 of the 435 U.S. Representatives either through in-person meetings or on the phone. In the days immediately following Advocacy Day, several new co-sponsors signed onto the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act (now known as the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act), and dozens more signed \"Dear Colleague\" letters that the bill authors sent to the Senate HELP and House Energy & Commerce Committees urging them to mark-up and pass the bill out of their respective committees. Less than two months after the letters were sent, both committees marked up the bill favorably and referred it to the full House and Senate. We hope you will join us for the seventh annual Pancreatic Cancer Advocacy Day next year on June 17 - 18, 2013. Registration opens in January 2013.

RECOR d Ad VOCAC y dAy ATTEndAnCE MAKEs IMPACT On COngREss 6 Fall 2012 OUTREACHCAnCER VACCI nEs: A n OVEl APPROACH fOR TREATI ng PAnCREATIC CAnCER Cancer vaccines are an innovative cancer treatment currently being studied in clinical trials for pancreatic cancer. The term \"vaccine\" is generally associated with prevention of disease, such as immunization against an infection. However, cancer vaccines are used to treat existing disease. The goal of cancer vaccines is to help the immune system to recognize cancer cells as foreign and attack them. The immune system is often not able to identify cancer cells as foreign or dangerous. This may happen for several reasons. In some cases, cancer and normal cells are so similar that the cancer cells go unnoticed. Also, some cancer cells can undergo changes that allow them to hide from the immune system. In addition, some cancer cells have the ability to send chemical messages that stop the immune system from responding. Cancer vaccines help the body recognize cancer cells by introducing cancer-associated antigens to the body. An antigen is a specific type of protein that the body \"sees\" as foreign. Once a cancer vaccine is injected into the body, cells from the immune system engulf the vaccine and display the antigens to the immune system. Then, the immune system recognizes the foreign cells and responds by attacking the cancer cells that contain this type of antigen. Researchers continue to investigate and learn more about the specific antigens associated with pancreatic cancer. Cancer cell antigens can be unique to individual tumors, shared by several tumor types or expressed by the normal tissue from which a tumor grows. With pancreatic cancer, several different antigens are currently being studied. POTEnTIAl BEnEfITs Of CAnCER VACCInEs They use the body's own immune system to fight off cancer cells. They provide an alternative to standard treatment or enhance the effectiveness of standard treatment. They cause minimal side effects. POTEnTIAl sIdE EffECTs Of CAnCER VACCInEs The side effects of cancer vaccines are generally milder than chemotherapy side effects. They cause flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea and fatigue. Redness, itching and/or sores can also occur around the injection site.The immune system could also potentially attack normal cells in the body. This could cause fever, achy muscles and joints, and inflammation of the pancreas, called pancreatitis. TyPEs Of CAnCER VACCInEs Several different types of cancer vaccines are being studied to use at different stages of pancreatic cancer. Some are used after surgery to try to prevent a cancer recurrence; others are used to delay or stop the growth of cancer in patients who are not candidates for pancreatic surgery. Other cancer vaccines attack cancer cells that have not been killed by other forms of treatment. Vaccines for the treatment of pancreatic cancer are only available in clinical trials. PAnCREATIC CAnCER V ACCInE ClInICAl TRIAls Clinical trials are underway to thoroughly evaluate the safety and efficacy of different pancreatic cancer vaccines. The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network is aware of numerous vaccine studies in progress for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. (See a listing of the studies on the next page.) The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network recommends that all patients consider clinical trials when exploring treatment options.

I thought it was liver cancer, but it turned out to be locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer. I told the doctor and physician assistant who broke the news to me: \"No one gets off in this life easy.\" I knew this road was going to be tough. I was referred to a hospital known for treating pancreatic cancer in Seattle for staging and treatment. From July 2009 to September 2010, I was treated with a standard protocol of chemotherapy along with a more aggressive chemoradiation combination. The primary tumor was 4.5 cm in size at diagnosis and by my latest CT scan in June 2012, it had shrunk to about 14 mm. The tumor is stable so far; no further growth or metastasis has been detected. The last time I was treated was in September 2010. Presently, every six months I see my oncologist and have a CT scan. At one time, I was told by my oncologist, \"I never told you this, but, I gave you four years.\" I replied, \"I was never going to ask the prognosis with this bad boy; I'd rather not know the time I have left.\" I decided that rather than wait and die, I should be proactive, get informed and become involved in my care. After diagnosis, I started down the road of self-advocacy by contacting another Seattle cancer center for information on integrative medicine. An informative naturopath professional recommended supplements to help me deal with side effect and symptom management and also suggested I read a book on nutrition and cancer. I also wanted to learn about all of my treatment options, so I decided to look into clinical trials in my area. I know that clinical trials are the only way new treatments can be made available to someone like me. However, there were none that I qualified for that were close to my home or available for my situation, so I was not able to pursue a trial at that time. Learning about pancreatic cancer and about the exciting new treatments that will be available in the future is very important, so I attended educational seminars hosted in Seattle by the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. They were very informative and gave me the opportunity to learn from experts in the field of pancreatic cancer. I have been fortunate to have top medical researchers and doctors located right here in my hometown. I also attended a fundraising event where I had the opportunity to meet long term survivors. I met a volunteer whose mother was diagnosed six years ago with stage IV pancreatic cancer and is doing very well. I told the volunteer, \"I didn't think that was possible.\" He said, \"The clinical trial worked.\" The cancer actually improved my health in some areas. I lost over 20 pounds with no strength reduction; this was good for me because I needed to lose a little weight. I feel so much lighter now. Last summer, I was able to complete a big 160-mile bicycle ride with 9,000 feet of elevation. I was too heavy before the cancer diagnosis to do that ride! Losing weight also lowered my blood pressure, which was reaching the level of pre-hypertension. Getting help and support from others is as important as being informed and involved in your care. I am fortunate that there is an in-person support community in my area. This great support group also offers interesting educational sessions. It also helps to have a sense of humor when dealing with this cancer!A sTOR y Of HOPE And InsPIRATIOn By P. Pisani, Snohomish, WA P.

Fall 2012 OUTREACH 9In February 2012, Ashley Anderson's fianc\u00e9 Tim Thiel took her to the emergency room for what they thought was acid reflux. Shooting stomach pains kept her up at night and a persistent back pain had plagued her for several months. As they were waiting for the results, they overheard hospital staff talking. \"They said pancreatic cancer,\" Ashley said. \"Tim and I just looked at each other and I asked, 'Are they talking about me? What's a pancreas?' \" The next day, Ashley went into surgery for a biopsy. Before she woke up, doctors broke the news to Tim that Ashley had stage IV pancreatic cancer and likely had just a few months to live. She was only 26. \"I didn't want to hear the odds,\" she recalled. \"Tim did a lot of research, but I wouldn't let him tell me the statistics. I'm not a statistic.\" At first, Ashley struggled to remain positive. The cancer had spread throughout her abdomen and doctors had to surgically implant a feeding tube. After she started chemotherapy, she lost her hair and remembers the shock of seeing her reflection in the mirror and not recognizing herself. As a former 911 dispatcher, Ashley knew that taking control of the situation was key to restoring her sense of hope. \"When I was released from the hospital, I just wanted to sleep. People pushed me. I started taking walks in a wheelchair and set small goals for myself. In May, I started progressing.\" She began eating by mouth again and gradually began gaining weight. In June, Ashley was well enough to join Tim and more than 4,000 others at PurpleStride Washington, D.C. \"It was so encouraging to meet other survivors there,\" she said. \"One had the Whipple procedure, which I hope to have someday. And there were all of these people raising awareness and educating people about the disease.\" In August, Ashley traveled to Pennsylvania for PurpleStride Pittsburgh, and in September joined her family's team at PurpleStride Detroit. \"The events touch me in different ways,\" she said. \"At the beginning, it's very emotional. But it is also very encouraging with the doctors talking about new developments and all of the survivors. And it's fun! PurpleStride D.C. had a band and so everyone was dancing to celebrate, whether it was for the cause or just being alive.\" Recently, Ashley went in to see her oncologist, and the normally hard-to-read physician was openly shocked at her progress. \"My doctor was grinning,\" says Ashley. \"And that grin was so motivating. I want to make her smile. I want to confuse her and shock her. When I was diagnosed, people were shocked that someone my age had pancreatic cancer. Now I want to shock them by how well I'm doing. My doctor is hopeful now. I'm hopeful.\" To read more about Ashley's inspiring journey, visit her blog at www.cancerkickingirl.com.fIgHTIng P AnCREATIC CAnCER AT AgE 26 On September 30, family members and friends touched by pancreatic cancer came together in more than 50 communities nationwide for the second annual PurpleLight National Vigil for Hope. Venues for the events, which provided an opportunity to honor loved ones fighting pancreatic cancer and those who have lost the fight, varied from state capitol buildings and beautiful parks to prominent cancer facilities. Many PurpleLight gatherings featured guest speakers, including local volunteers, caregivers, survivors, and pancreatic cancer researchers. During the remembrance ceremony, families and friends stood and illuminated purple glow sticks when names of their loved ones were read. As the purple glow filled the sky, participants were reminded of the reason we are all fighting to end this disease. PurpleLight united thousands of individuals, from Los Angeles to Miami, from San Francisco to Boston, determined to raise awareness, create hope and turn the nation purple.

PurpleLight Manhattan Beach10 Fall 2012 OUTREACHIn December of 2005, my husband Ken was diagnosed with neuroendocrine cancer of the pancreas. He was only 46 and the most athletic, competitive person I knew. During his fight with pancreatic cancer, I promised myself that I would do anything and everything I could to help him fight the disease. I did the research online, contacted doctors, searched clinical trials and reached out to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. I really believe we did do all we could, but it wasn't enough. The tools we needed simply weren't available. They hadn't been developed yet. There was no hope. Ken survived 22 months, longer than most, but not long enough. Not long enough to spend time with his children, golf with his friends, or grow old with me. Two weeks after his death, I joined the Detroit Affiliate to hand out wristbands at the Detroit Lions game. I've been an active volunteer since. I really didn't know much about politics, but advocacy interested me. When I went to the second annual Pancreatic Cancer Advocacy Day in Washington, DC in 2007, I realized how good it felt to be part of this movement and of this organization. The following year, I took over as the Detroit Affiliate Advocacy Coordinator. I've been able to get to know our Michigan political representatives and our affiliate members through the proclamation process, office visits and affiliate events. I've learned a lot through training, and trial and error. Since 2007, I've gone to four more Advocacy Days, and can't imagine not being part of that emotional, powerful and amazing experience. My husband and I were high school sweethearts and married for 29 years. My family's lives will forever be affected by his loss. Being a volunteer for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network has given me a purpose. You don't realize your power until you get involved and open your eyes to see all of the amazing ways you can continue the fight. I help to put a face to pancreatic cancer and nothing is more powerful.

There is power in persistence and numbers. Our local group of advocates met with one of our members of Congress several times who was always very pleasant, but would not agree to cosponsor the Pancreatic Cancer Research & Education Act (now the Recalcitrant Cancer Research Act ). Each time, I would return home and my husband would say, \"He has no idea who he is saying no to.\" We just kept persisting, politely of course, for three years and growing our group until eventually he signed on. I became involved because of my dad, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 1999 and was gone by October. I needed to do something more than just throwing my hands up in frustration. My parents always drilled into us growing up that we had a civic responsibility. A lot of people feel like they don't have a voice; the first few years, I wasn't sure how much of an impact I was making. I just brought myself to the cause and was always very honest and passionate about the organization and what we were fighting for. The turning point came when another volunteer told me I inspired them. I realized I wasn't meant to do all of the work alone, but to bring more people to the fight. Since then, I feel like we've doubled in size almost every year. When they say grassroots, that's really what this movement is. All of us are busy so when we volunteer our time, it says something. I feel like we really are a big family with a common drive. I'm very proud and honored to be part of this group.

In this case, that's exactly what happened,\" said Ocean State Job Lot Marketing Director David Sarlitto, who handles such requests for his company. Ocean State Job Lot became aware of pancreatic cancer when the company's partners learned about a close associate who had recently lost his wife to the disease. \"As soon as people heard the words pancreatic cancer, their jaws dropped. They felt they could offer no words of consolation or hope,\" Sarlitto said. \"That's when we knew this was a cause that we needed to fundraise for and educate people about.\" Ocean State Job Lot President Marc Perlman was further moved to act when he learned the sobering facts about the disease. Sarlitto was given the task of mobilizing a fundraising campaign in just three days. On a Wednesday, the Job Lot team held a brainstorming session and by Friday of the same week, the group had organized a three-day fundraising campaign complete with in-store posters, scripts at checkout stands, a social media blitz and an online promotion that reaches more than 100,000 consumers a day. In just four days, 107 participating stores and an online retailer had raised more than $54,600 in cause marketing revenue and matching gifts for PurpleStride Rhode Island 2012. \"We deeply appreciate the tremendous support and commitment Ocean State Job Lot and its customers have shown for our organization and the fight against pancreatic cancer,\" said Donna DeDario, Senior Manager of Corporate Relations for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. \"Their contributions are inspirational to us all.\"OCEAn sTATE jOB lOT sUPPORT sTEMs fROM A PERsOnAl COnnECTIO n When the Omaha Affiliate hosted its inaugural PurpleStride event on June 11, 2011, the group raised more than $47,000, a noteworthy achievement for a first-time event. However, in 2012, Omaha supporters took the event to the next level by securing their largest corporate team participant to date: Union Pacific, a company operating one of North America's premier railroad franchises covering 23 states. Allison Watson, the Omaha Affiliate's Media Representative, became involved with the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network after losing her father to the disease. Her passion and dedication for the cause helped to open the door for potential sponsorship at Union Pacific, who generously served as PurpleStride Omaha's Presenting Sponsor this year. However, the company's support did not stop there. Union Pacific formed 25 teams that would eventually participate in PurpleStride Omaha in 2012. By recruiting team captains, organizing fundraising incentive challenges and sending companywide emails, company supporters launched a campaign to make pancreatic cancer front-page news at Union Pacific. \"Union Pacific's support dramatically increased the success of our event this year,\" Watson said. \"PurpleStride Omaha's grand total for 2012 is nearly $169,000.

Supporter Bob Klem has turned his passion into a growing fundraising endeavor. When he lost his wife Becky to pancreatic cancer in 1999, Bob, as well as his daughters Rachel and Sarah, were understandably distraught. Eight years later, the family decided to honor her memory by generating support for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network through a hockey themed fundraising idea of soliciting donations based on Bob's hockey wins. That support eventually evolved into a benefit game. Soon after, the Klem family formed the Have A Skate with Bob Foundation. Bob teamed up last year with the American Hockey League's Rockford IceHogs team and Central Hockey League's Missouri Mavericks and began playing Skate's benefit games before the professional teams match ups to increase awareness and fundraising for the cause. He also took the step to honor his good friend Tom Jacobson, who passed from pancreatic cancer in 2011. The first game with the IceHogs was a notable success, raising more than $15,000. This season, Have A Skate with Bob benefit games are scheduled in Rockford, Illinois, Independence, Missouri, and Topeka, Kansas before IceHogs, Missouri Mavericks and Topeka RoadRunners games, respectively. To participate in the benefit games, players raise donations and solicit sponsorships with all proceeds donated to the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. Bob also holds silent auctions featuring hockey related memorabilia. To date, the foundation has raised more than $45,000 for pancreatic cancer research. \"Through our journey with pancreatic cancer, and Becky's memory always with us, we have learned much about life, love and facing challenges with grace and determination,\" Bob said. \"Thirteen years later, Becky lives on through me, my girls, my grandson Bobby, and all of our efforts to fight this terrible disease.\" To learn more, visit the Have A Skate with Bob Foundation website at www.skatewithbob.com.THE MARATHO n gOddEss: H OnORIng A lOVIng f ATHER And s UPPORTI ng A gREAT CAUsE Embarking on a journey in 2008 to improve her own health, Julie Weiss set out on a course not knowing she would later inspire and benefit many people facing pancreatic cancer. As part of a weight loss strategy, Julie began participating in marathons at that time. During the next four years, she competed in more than 23 marathons, as well as a number of triathlons. Cheering her on through each event was her biggest fan: her father, Maurice Weiss. Buoyed by her success with other competitions, Julie set her sights on her ultimate prize: the Boston Marathon. Despite 18 attempts, she was unable to qualify for the competition. After her last failed bid to enter, she experienced a life-altering event. In October of 2010, Maurice was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. He passed away 35 days later on November 24. Another Boston Marathon qualifier loomed on the horizon one week later; Julie had signed up and her father was to attend with her. With renewed determination and the spirit of her father guiding her, Julie reached her goal, qualifying for the Boston event on her nineteenth attempt and ran the race. Achieving the Boston goal served as the catalyst for turning her pastime into a life mission. Soon after, she set an even more ambitious goal of running 52 marathons in one year (52 weeks) to pay tribute to her beloved father, heighten awareness of pancreatic cancer and fundraise for the cause. Now at the midpoint of her crusade, Julie has raised more than $106,000 for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network. \"Through my love of running, my love of life, and my love for my father, I plan to continue to raise hope, money, and awareness around the world for those who have been affected by pancreatic cancer,\" Julie said. \"I want to show how strong the human spirit can be.\" To learn more about Julie's quest, visit her website at www.marathongoddess.com.

The result was the creation of the top fundraising team at PurpleStride Washington D.C 2012. The Strudler family's Miracle for Melanie team was formed to honor Melanie Darvin Strudler, a devoted physical education teacher in the Montgomery County School system who passed away in May 2012 at age 61 after a 19-month battle with the disease. Following her mother's diagnosis, Erica, a sales manager with Groupon and the Strudler's youngest daughter, found the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network through an online search. \"A PALS associate got back to her right away after she asked for information and she was impressed by that,\" said her father, Lewis, a Senior Director of Marketing with Monumental Sports. Soon after, supporting the cause became a mission for Erica, the fundraising team's captain. \"She got our family, her friends, business associates and many others involved and made sure that all of our efforts were successful,\" Lewis said. \"Melanie was deeply touched by everything Erica did for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network and had planned to participate in the event, but unfortunately she died one month before it was held.\" The 2012 Miracle for Melanie team attracted 140 walkers and raised more than $18,000 due primarily to Erica's hard work. The success of the team's effort was just a starting point for the family's support of the cause. After PurpleStride, the family established the Melanie D. Strudler Legacy Fund which, including revenue from the event, has raised almost $30,000. Erica and Lewis also attended Pancreatic Cancer Advocacy Day this year, with Erica enthusiastically advocating on Capitol Hill. \"We think the world of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network and are glad to support their efforts any way we can,\" Lewis added. \"We encourage everyone to engage in advocacy so that the government devotes more resources to studying this disease.\" Team Everyone Walks for Peter, one of the great PurpleStride success stories of 2012, reflected the affection, respect and admiration many felt for Peter A. Tomaras, a partner with the Chicago law firm Wildman Harrold who succumbed to pancreatic cancer in December 2011 at age 59. \"Peter touched the lives of countless people through his profession, our church and community,\" said his wife ZoeAnn Tomaras, an elementary school music teacher. \"His diagnosis came as a shock to everyone he knew. After his passing, his law firm formed a committee to get people involved in supporting the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network.\" ZoeAnn was both elated and tearful about the team's success. \"PurpleStride Chicago 2012 was held on a cold and rainy morning in April, but 101 people still showed up to walk and share their stories about Peter,\" she said. \"I cut the ribbon to start the walk. We were overwhelmed that so many who knew him participated.\" Peter's sister, Margo, is a Senior Director in the School of Education at De Paul University. \"She lost her mother, who was just 63, and now her brother, both to pancreatic cancer,\" ZoeAnn said. \"Not much has changed in the 23 years between their deaths. Now, Margo is determined to help in any way she can, especially through advocacy. Understandably, she is worried about other family members.\" The Tomaras family's own support of the cause is extraordinary. In addition to establishing Named Legacy Funds in honor of Peter and Betty, they created a Keep the Memory Alive page in Peter's name. To date, more than $10,000 in honor and memorial gifts have been made. ZoeAnn added her family is proud to contribute to the organization to further research and also show their own gratitude for support they received during their journey through the disease. \"When our friend Harriet, a five-year pancreatic cancer survivor, told us about the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, we found valuable information and resources,\" she said. \"The stories on the website offered us hope and encouragement.\" From left, the Strudler family: Erica, Lewis, Melanie and Allison Strudler-Lee Peter Tomaras14 Fall 2012 OUTREACHTEMPUR -PEdIC EnHAnCEs ITs sUPPORT By AdVAnCIng AdVOCAC y EffORTs On CAPITO l HIll A comfortable night's sleep.
