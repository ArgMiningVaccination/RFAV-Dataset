I try to be more aware of the foods I eat. I limit alcohol, and watch my portions.I also work out 5-7 days a week. My son islearning from me and is doing the same things I do.RICARDO ELEY \" \"1IntroductionIntroduction What you choose to eat affects your chances of developing high blood pressure, or hypertension (the medical term). Recent studiesshow that blood pressure can be lowered by following the DietaryApproaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating plan\u2014and by eating less salt, also called sodium. While each step alone lowers blood pressure, the combination of the eating plan and a reduced sodium intake gives the biggest benefitand may help prevent the development of high blood pressure. This booklet, based on the DASH research findings, tells how to follow the DASH eating plan and reduce the amount of sodium you consume. It offers tips on how to start and stay on the eatingplan, as well as a week of menus and some recipes. The menus and recipes are given for two levels of daily sodium consumption\u20142,300 and 1,500 milligrams per day. Twenty-three hundred milligrams is the highest level considered acceptable by the NationalHigh Blood Pressure Education Program. It is also the highestamount recommended for healthy Americans by the 2005 \"U.S.Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\" The 1,500 milligram level canlower blood pressure further and more recently is the amount recommended by the Institute of Medicine as an adequate intakelevel and one that most people should try to achieve. The lower your salt intake is, the lower your blood pressure. Studies have found that the DASH menus containing 2,300 mil-ligrams of sodium can lower blood pressure and that an even lower level of sodium, 1,500 milligrams, can further reduce bloodpressure. All the menus are lower in sodium than what adults in the United States currently eat\u2014about 4,200 milligrams per day in men and 3,300 milligrams per day in women. Those with high blood pressure and prehypertension may benefit especially from following the DASH eating plan and reducing theirsodium intake.2 Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASHMy family's food choices have always been pretty good. We eat a lot of fruit,vegetables, and low-fat yogurt. LILLY KRAMER \" \"Blood pressure is the force of blood against artery walls. It is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and recorded as twonumbers\u2014systolic pressure (when the heart beats) over diastolic pressure (when the heart relaxes between beats). Both numbers are important. (See box 1 on page 4.) Blood pressure rises and falls during the day. But when it stays elevated over time, then it's called high blood pressure. High bloodpressure is dangerous because it makes the heart work too hard, andthe high force of the blood flow can harm arteries and organs suchas the heart, kidneys, brain, and eyes. High blood pressure oftenhas no warning signs or symptoms. Once it occurs, it usually lasts alifetime. If uncontrolled, it can lead to heart and kidney disease,stroke, and blindness. High blood pressure affects more than 65 million\u2014or 1 in 3\u2014 American adults. About 28 percent of American adults ages 18 andolder, or about 59 million people, have prehypertension, a conditionthat also increases the chance of heart disease and stroke. Highblood pressure is especially common among African Americans,who tend to develop it at an earlier age and more often than Whites.It is also common among older Americans\u2014individuals with normalblood pressure at age 55 have a 90 percent lifetime risk for develop-ing high blood pressure. High blood pressure can be controlled if you take these steps: Maintain a healthy weight. Be moderately physically active on most days of the week. Follow a healthy eating plan, which includes foods lower in sodium. If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation. If you have high blood pressure and are prescribed medication, take it as directed. All steps but the last also help to prevent high blood pressure.3What Is High Blood Pressure?What Is High Blood Pressure?4 Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASHBlood Pressure Levels for Adults*BOX 1 Normal Prehypertension HypertensionLess than 120 120-139 140 or higher Less than 80 80-89 90 or higherand or orGood for you!

The more your bloodpressure rises above normal, the greater the health risk. Scientists supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) conducted two key studies. Their findingsshowed that blood pressures were reduced with an eating plan thatis low in saturated fat, cholesterol, and total fat and that emphasizesfruits, vegetables, and fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products.This eating plan\u2014known as the DASH eating plan\u2014also includeswhole grain products, fish, poultry, and nuts. It is reduced in leanred meat, sweets, added sugars, and sugar-containing beverages compared to the typical American diet. It is rich in potassium, magnesium, and calcium, as well as protein and fiber. (See box 2 for the DASH studies' daily nutrient goals.)What Is the DASH Eating Plan? Daily Nutrient Goals Used in the DASH Studies (for a 2,100 Calorie Eating Plan) Total fat 27% of calories Sodium 2,300 mg* Saturated fat 6% of calories Potassium 4,700 mg Protein 18% of calories Calcium 1,250 mg Carbohydrate 55% of calories Magnesium 500 mg Cholesterol 150 mg Fiber 30 gBOX 2 * 1,500 mg sodium was a lower goal tested and found to be even better for lowering blood pressure. It was particularly effective for middle-aged and older individuals, African Americans, and those who already had high blood pressure.g = grams; mg = milligramsThe DASH eating plan follows heart healthy guidelines to limit saturated fat and cholesterol. It focuses on increasing intake of foods rich in nutrients that are expected to lower blood pressure,mainly minerals (like potassium, calcium, and magnesium), protein,and fiber. It includes nutrient-rich foods so that it meets othernutrient requirements as recommended by the Institute of Medicine. The first DASH study involved 459 adults with systolic blood pressures of less than 160 mmHg and diastolic pressures of 80-95mmHg. About 27 percent of the participants had high blood pressure. About 50 percent were women and 60 percent wereAfrican Americans. It compared three eating plans: a plan thatincludes foods similar to what many Americans regularly eat; a planthat includes foods similar to what many Americans regularly eatplus more fruits and vegetables; and the DASH eating plan. Allthree plans included about 3,000 milligrams of sodium daily.None of the plans was vegetarian or used specialty foods. Results were dramatic. Participants who followed both the plan that included more fruits and vegetables and the DASH eating planhad reduced blood pressure. But the DASH eating plan had the6 Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASHThe DASH studies were sponsored by the NHLBI and conducted at four medical centers. There was also a central coordinatingcenter at Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research inPortland, OR. The four medical centers were: Brigham andWomen's Hospital, Boston, MA; Duke Hypertension Center and theSarah W. Stedman Nutrition and Metabolism Center, Durham, NC;Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD; andPennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, LA.Who Helped With DASH?7What Is the DASH Eating Plan?greatest effect, especially for those with high blood pressure. Furthermore, the blood pressure reductions came fast\u2014within 2 weeks of starting the plan. The second DASH study looked at the effect on blood pressure of a reduced dietary sodium intake as participants followed eitherthe DASH eating plan or an eating plan typical of what manyAmericans consume. This second study involved 412 participants.Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two eating plansand then followed for a month at each of the three sodium levels.The three sodium levels were a higher intake of about 3,300 milligrams per day (the level consumed by many Americans), anintermediate intake of about 2,300 milligrams per day, and a lowerintake of about 1,500 milligrams per day. Results showed that reducing dietary sodium lowered blood pressure for both eating plans. At each sodium level, blood pressure waslower on the DASH eating plan than on the other eating plan. Thegreatest blood pressure reductions were for the DASH eating plan at the sodium intake of 1,500 milligrams per day. Those with highblood pressure saw the greatest reductions, but those with prehyper-tension also had large decreases. Together these studies show the importance of lowering sodium intake\u2014whatever your eating plan. For a true winning combina-tion, follow the DASH eating plan and lower your intake of salt and sodium. How Do I Make the DASH? The DASH eating plan used in the studies calls for a certain numberof daily servings from various food groups. These are given in box3 on page 8 for 2,000 calories per day. The number of servings yourequire may vary, depending on your caloric need. Box 4 on page10 gives the number of servings for 1,600, 2,600, and 3,100 calories. The DASH eating plan used along with other lifestyle changes can help you prevent and control blood pressure. If your blood pressureis not too high, you may be able to control it entirely by changingyour eating habits, losing weight if you are overweight, getting regular physical activity, and cutting down on alcohol. The DASHeating plan also has other benefits, such as lowering LDL (\"bad\")cholesterol, which, along with lowering blood pressure, can reduceyour risk for getting heart disease.8 Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASHFollowing the DASH Eating Plan Grains* Vegetables Fruits Fat-free or low-fat milk and milkproducts Lean meats, poultry, and fish Nuts, seeds, and legumes Fats and oils \u00a7 Sweets and added sugars6-8 4-5 4-5 2-3 6 or less 4-5 per week 2-3 5 or less per week1 slice bread 1 oz dry cereal 1/2cup cooked rice, pasta, or cereal 1 cup raw leafy vegetable 1/2cup cut-up raw or cooked vegetable 1/2cup vegetable juice 1 medium fruit 1/4cup dried fruit 1/2cup fresh, frozen, or canned fruit 1/2cup fruit juice 1 cup milk or yogurt 11/2oz cheese 1 oz cooked meats, poultry, or fish 1 egg 1/3cup or 11/2oz nuts 2 Tbsp peanut butter2 Tbsp or 1/2oz seeds 1/2cup cooked legumes (dry beans and peas) 1 soft margarine 1 tsp vegetable oil1 Tbsp mayonnaise2 Tbsp salad dressing 1 Tbsp sugar 1 Tbsp jelly or jam 1/2 cup sorbet, gelatin 1 cup lemonadeBOX 3 Food GroupDaily Servings Serving Sizes * Whole grains are recommended for most grain servings as a good source of fiber and nutrients.

The number of daily servings in a food group may vary from those listed depend-ing on your caloric needs. Use this chart to help you plan your menus ortake it with you when you go to the store. Since eggs are high in cholesterol, limit egg yolk intake to no more than four per week; two egg whites have the same protein content as 1 oz of meat. \u00a7Fat content changes serving amount for fats and oils. For example, 1 Tbsp of regular salad dressing equals one serving; 1 Tbsp of a low-fat dressing equals one-half serving; 1 Tbsp of a fat-free dressing equals zero servings.If you need to lose weight, even a small weight loss will help to lower your risks of developing high blood pressure and other serioushealth conditions. At the very least, you should not gain weight.A recent study showed that people can lose weight while followingthe DASH eating plan and lowering their sodium intake. In a studyof 810 participants, one-third were taught how to lower their sodium intake and follow the DASH eating plan on their own.Most of them needed to lose weight as well. They followed theDASH eating plan at lower calorie levels and they increased theirphysical activity. Over the course of 18 months, participants lostweight and improved their blood pressure control.10Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASHDASH Eating Plan\u2014 Number of Daily Servings for Other Calorie LevelsBOX 4 Grains* VegetablesFruitsFat-free or low- fat milk and milkproducts Lean meats, poultry, and fish Nuts, seeds, and legumes Fats and oilsSweets and calories/day3,100 calories/dayServings/Day 2,600 calories/day * Whole grains are recommended for most grain servings as a good source of fiber and nutrients.11 I was overweight.

Aim for a caloric level that islower than what you usually consume. In addition, you can makeyour diet lower in calories by using the tips in box 5. The best wayto take off pounds is to do so gradually, get more physical activity,and eat a balanced diet that is lower in calories and fat. For somepeople at very high risk for heart disease or stroke, medication will be necessary. To develop a weight-loss or weight-maintenanceprogram that works well for you, consult with your doctor or registered dietitian. Combining the DASH eating plan with a regular physical activity program, such as walking or swimming, will help you both shedpounds and stay trim for the long term. You can do an activity for 30 minutes at one time, or choose shorter periods of at least 10 minutes each. (See box 6 on page 14.) The important thing is tototal about 30 minutes of activity each day. (To avoid weight gain,try to total about 60 minutes per day.) You should be aware that the DASH eating plan has more daily servings of fruits, vegetables, and whole grain foods than you maybe used to eating. Because the plan is high in fiber, it can causebloating and diarrhea in some persons. To avoid these problems,gradually increase your intake of fruit, vegetables, and whole grain foods. This booklet gives menus and recipes from the DASH studies for both 2,300 and 1,500 milligrams of daily sodium intake. Twenty-three hundred milligrams of sodium equals about 6 grams, or 1 teaspoon, of table salt (sodium chloride); 1,500 milligrams of sodium equals about 4 grams, or 2/3teaspoon, of table salt. The key to reducing salt intake is making wise food choices. Only a small amount of salt that we consume comes from the salt addedat the table, and only small amounts of sodium occur naturally infood. Processed foods account for most of the salt and sodiumAmericans consume. So, be sure to read food labels to choose products lower in sodium. You may be surprised to find whichfoods have sodium. They include baked goods, certain cereals, soysauce, seasoned salts, monosodium glutamate (MSG), baking soda,and is wide.13What Is the DASH Eating Plan?How to Lower Calories on the DASH Eating Plan The DASH eating plan can be adopted to promote weight loss. It is rich in lower-calorie foods, such as fruits and vegetables. You canmake it lower in calories by replacing higher calorie foods such assweets with more fruits and vegetables\u2014and that also will make it easier for you to reach your DASH goals. Here are some examples: To increase fruits\u2014 Eat a medium apple instead of four shortbread cookies. You'll save 80 calories. Eat 1/4cup of dried apricots instead of a 2-ounce bag of pork rinds. You'll save 230 calories. To increase vegetables\u2014 Have a hamburger that's 3 ounces of meat instead of 6 ounces. Add a 1/2-cup serving of carrots and a 1/2-cup serving of spinach. You'll save more than 200 calories. Instead of 5 ounces of chicken, have a stir fry with 2 ounces of chicken and 1 1/2cups of raw vegetables. Use a small amount of vegetable oil. You'll save 50 calories. To increase fat-free or low-fat milk products\u2014 Have a 1/2-cup serving of low-fat frozen yogurt instead of a 1/2-cup serving of full-fat ice cream. You'll save about 70 calories. And don't forget these calorie-saving tips: Use fat-free or low-fat condiments. Use half as much vegetable oil, soft or liquid margarine, mayonnaise, or salad dressing, or choose available low-fat or fat-free versions. Eat smaller portions\u2014cut back gradually. Choose fat-free or low-fat milk and milk products. Check the food labels to compare fat content in packaged foods\u2014items marked fat-free or low-fat are not always lower in calories than their regular versions. Limit foods with lots of added sugar, such as pies, flavored yogurts, candy bars, ice cream, sherbet, regular soft drinks, and fruit drinks. Eat fruits canned in their own juice or in water. Add fruit to plain fat-free or low-fat yogurt. Snack on fruit, vegetable sticks, unbuttered and unsalted popcorn, or rice cakes. Drink water or club soda\u2014zest it up with a wedge of lemon or lime.BOX 514Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASHMake a Dash for DASH Thirty minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each day can help. If your blood pressure is moderately elevated, 30 minutes of brisk walking on most days a week may be enough to keep you off medication. If you take medication for high blood pressure, 30 minutes of moderate physical activity can make your medication work more effectively and make you feel better. If you don't have high blood pressure, being physically active can help keep it that way. If you have normal blood pressure\u2014but are not active\u2014your chances of developing high blood pressure increase, especially as you get older or if you become overweight or obese or develop diabetes. Getting started: Your physical activity program can be as simple as a 15-minute walk around the block each morning and evening. Graduallybuild up your program and set new goals to stay motivated. Theimportant thing is to find something you enjoy, and do it safely. Andremember\u2014trying too hard at first can lead to injury and cause you to give up. If you have a chronic health problem or a family history ofheart disease at an early age, be sure to talk with your doctor beforelaunching a new physical activity program. 1. Set a schedule and try to keep it. 2. Get a friend or family member to join you. Motivate each other to keep it up. 3. Cross-train. Alternate between different activities so you don't strain one part of your body day after day. 4. Set goals.5. Reward yourself. At the end of each month that you stay on your exercise program, reward yourself with something new\u2014new clothes, a compact disc, a new book\u2014something that will help keepyou committed. But don't use food as a reward.BOX 6Because it is rich in fruits and vegetables, which are naturally lower in sodium than many other foods, the DASH eating plan makes iteasier to consume less salt and sodium. Still, you may want to beginby adopting the DASH eating plan at the level of 2,300 milligramsof sodium per day and then further lower your sodium intake to1,500 milligrams per day. Boxes 7, 8, and 9 on pages 16-18 offer tips on how to reduce the salt and sodium content in your diet, and boxes 10 and 11 on pages19 and 20 show how to use food labels to find lower sodium products. The DASH eating plan also emphasizes potassium from food, especially fruits and vegetables, to help keep blood pressure levelshealthy. A potassium-rich diet may help to reduce elevated or highblood pressure, but be sure to get your potassium from foodsources, not from supplements. Many fruits and vegetables, somemilk products, and fish are rich sources of potassium. (See box 12on page 21.) However, fruits and vegetables are rich in the form ofpotassium (potassium with bicarbonate precursors) that favorablyaffects acid-base metabolism. This form of potassium may help toreduce risk of kidney stones and bone loss. While salt substitutescontaining potassium are sometimes needed by persons on drugtherapy for high blood pressure, these supplements can be harmfulto people with certain medical conditions. Ask your doctor beforetrying salt substitutes or supplements.

Choose fresh, frozen, or canned (low-sodium or no-salt-added) vegetables. Use fresh poultry, fish, and lean meat, rather than canned, smoked, or processed types. Choose ready-to-eat breakfast cereals that are lower in sodium. Limit cured foods (such as bacon and ham); foods packed in brine (such as pickles, pickled vegetables, olives, and sauerkraut); and condiments (such as mustard, horseradish, ketchup, and barbecue sauce). Limit even lower sodium versions of soy sauce and teriyaki sauce. Treat these condiments sparingly as you do table salt. Cook rice, pasta, and hot cereals without salt. Cut back on instant or flavored rice, pasta, and cereal mixes, which usually have added salt. Choose \"convenience\" foods that are lower in sodium. Cut back on frozen dinners, mixed dishes such as pizza, packaged mixes, canned soups or broths, and salad dressings\u2014these often have a lot of sodium. Rinse canned foods, such as tuna and canned beans, to remove some ofthe sodium. Use spices instead of salt.In cooking and at the table, flavor foods with herbs, spices, lemon, lime, vinegar, or salt-free seasoning blends. Start by cutting salt in half.BOX 8 18Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASHReducing Salt and Sodium When Eating Out Ask how foods are prepared.

Reading the \"Getting Started\" suggestions in box 13 should help you along the way. The DASH eating plan requires no specialfoods and has no hard-to-follow recipes. One way to begin is by seeing how DASH compares with your current food habits. Use the\"What's On Your Plate?\" form. (See box 14 on page 26.) Fill it in for1-2 days and see how it compares with the DASH plan. This willhelp you see what changes you need to make in your food choices. Remember that on some days the foods you eat may add up to more than the recommended servings from one food group and less fromanother. Similarly, you may have too much sodium on a particularday. But don't worry. Try your best to keep the average of severaldays close to the DASH eating plan and the sodium level recom-mended for you. Use the menus that begin on page 30 if you want to follow the menus similar to those used in the DASH trial\u2014or make up yourown using your favorite foods. In fact, your entire family can eatmeals using the DASH eating plan. Use box 3 on page 8 to chooseyour favorite foods from each food group based on your calorieneeds as described in the 2005 \"U.S. Dietary Guidelines forAmericans.\" The Dietary Guidelines determined that the DASH eating plan is an example of a healthy eating plan and recommends it as a plan thatnot only meets your nutritional needs but can accommodate variedtypes of cuisines and special needs. Remember that the DASH eating plan used along with other lifestyle changes can help you prevent and control your blood pressure.Important lifestyle recommendations for you include: achieve andmaintain a healthy weight, participate in your favorite regular physical activity, and, if you drink, use moderation in alcohol consumption (defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men). One important note: If you take medication to control high blood pressure, you should not stop using it. Follow the DASH eating planand talk with your doctor about your medication treatment. The tipsin box 15 on page 27 can help you continue to follow the DASH eating plan and make other healthy lifestyle changes for a lifetime.23What Is the DASH Eating Plan?24Your Guide to Lowering Your Blood Pressure With DASHGetting Started It's easy to adopt the DASH eating plan. Here are some ways to get started: Change gradually If you now eat one or two vegetables a day, add a serving at lunch and another at dinner. If you don't eat fruit now or have juice only at breakfast, add a serving to your meals or have it as a snack. Gradually increase your use of fat-free and low-fat milk and milk products to three servings a day. For example, drink milk with lunch or dinner, instead of soda, sugar-sweetened tea, or alcohol. Choose fat-free (skim) or low-fat (1 percent) milk and milk products to reduce your intake of saturated fat, total fat, cholesterol, and calories and to increase your calcium. Read the Nutrition Facts label on margarines and salad dressings to choose those lowest in saturated fat and trans fat. Treat meats as one part of the whole meal, instead of the focus Limit lean meats to 6 ounces a day\u2014all that's needed. Have only 3 ounces at a meal, which is about the size of a deck of cards. If you now eat large portions of meats, cut them back gradually\u2014by a half or a third at each meal. Include two or more vegetarian-style (meatless) meals each week. Increase servings of vegetables, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, and cooked dry beans in meals. Try casseroles, whole wheat pasta, and stir-fry dishes, which have less meat and more vegetables, grains, and dry beans.BOX 1325What Is the DASH Eating Plan?Use fruits or other foods low in saturated fat, trans fat, cho- lesterol, sodium, sugar, and calories as desserts and snacks Fruits and other lower fat foods offer great taste and variety. Use fruits canned in their own juice or packed in water. Fresh fruits require little or no preparation. Dried fruits are a good choice to carry with you or to have ready in the car. Try these snacks ideas: unsalted rice cakes; nuts mixed with raisins; graham crackers; fat-free and low-fat yogurt and frozen yogurt; popcorn with no salt or butter added; raw vegetables. Try these other tips Choose whole grain foods for most grain servings to get added nutrients, such as minerals and fiber. For example, choose whole wheat bread or whole grain cereals. If you have trouble digesting milk and milk products, try taking lactase enzyme pills (available at drugstores and groceries) with the milk products. Or, buy lactose-free milk, which has the lactase enzyme already added to it. If you are allergic to nuts, use seeds or legumes (cooked dried beans or peas). Use fresh, frozen, or low-sodium canned vegetables and fruits. Use the form in box 14 to track your food and physical activities habits before you start on the DASH eating plan or to see howyou're doing after a fewweeks. To record morethan 1 day, just copy theform. Total each day'sfood groups and comparewhat you ate with theDASH eating plan. To seehow the form looks com-pleted, check the menusthat start on page 30.

If you slip from the eating plan for a few days, don't let it keep you from reaching yourhealth goals. Get back on track. Here's how: Ask yourself why you got off-track. Was it at a party? Were you feeling stress at home or work? Find outwhat triggered your sidetrack and start again with the DASH plan. Don't worry about a slip. Everyone slips\u2014especially when learning something new. Rememberthat changing your lifestyle is a long-term process. See if you tried to do too much at once. Often, those starting a new lifestyle try to change too much at once.Instead, change one or two things at a time. Slowly but surely is thebest way to succeed. Break the process down into small steps. This not only keeps you from trying to do too much at once, but alsokeeps the changes simpler. Break complex goals into smaller, simplersteps, each of which is attainable. Write it down. Use the table in box 14 to keep track of what you eat and what you'redoing. This can help you find the problem. Keep track for several days.You may find, for instance, that you eat high-fat foods while watchingtelevision. If so, you could start keeping a substitute snack on hand to eat instead of the high-fat foods. This record also helps you be sure you're getting enough of each food group and physical activityeach day. Celebrate success. Treat yourself to a nonfood treat for your accomplishments.BOX 1528 29A Week With the DASH Eating PlanA Week With the DASH Eating Plan Here is a week of menus from the DASH eating plan. The menus allow you to have a daily sodium level of either 2,300 mg or, bymaking the noted changes, 1,500 mg. You'll also find that themenus sometimes call for you to use lower sodium, low-fat, fat-free,or reduced fat versions of products. The menus are based on 2,000 calories a day\u2014serving sizes should be increased or decreased for other calorie levels. To ease the calculations, some of the serving sizes have been rounded off.Also, some items may be in too small a quantity to have a listedfood group serving. Recipes for starred items are given on the laterpages. Some of these recipes give changes that can be used to lowertheir sodium level. Use the changes if you want to follow the DASHeating plan at 1,500 milligrams of sodium per day.
