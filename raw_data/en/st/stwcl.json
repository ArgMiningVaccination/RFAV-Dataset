Medical News Today only shows you brands and products that we stand behind.Our team thoroughly researches and evaluates the recommendations we make on our site. To establish that the product manufacturers addressed safety and efficacy standards, we: - Evaluate ingredients and composition: Do they have the potential to cause harm? - Fact-check all health claims: Do they align with the current body of scientific evidence? - Assess the brand: Does it operate with integrity and adhere to industry best practices? Getting regular exercise, eating a balanced diet, maintaining low stress levels, and getting enough sleep each night can all help maintain good energy levels. Can vitamins and supplements also help? Sometimes, people might need an extra boost of energy when life gets busy or during particularly intensive exercise. Here, we look at some of the most effective [vitamins](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/195878.php) and supplements for boosting energy levels. [Stress](/articles/145855.php) and [anxiety](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/anxiety/) can contribute to feelings of [fatigue](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/248002.php) and low energy. They can also make people feel less able to cope with daily demands. Ashwagandha is an adaptogen that could help boost energy levels. Adaptogens are plant derived substances that help the body better manage stress. The researchers behind a [2012 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/) [placebo](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/306437.php) group. They also found ashwagandha to well-tolerated.\" Results from another [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3545242/) Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an enzyme that exists naturally in the body, particularly in the heart, liver, pancreas, and kidneys. It is an [antioxidant](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301506.php) that [improves energy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178961/) In a [2014 review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4136529/) [Most people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178961/) - oily fish - liver or other organ meats - whole grains People with certain health conditions and those not getting enough from their diet might wish to ask their doctor about supplementing with CoQ10. Those taking blood thinners, taking [insulin](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/diabetes/whatisinsulin.php), or receiving [cancer](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/cancer-oncology/) treatment should check with a doctor before taking CoQ10. Mild side effects of CoQ10 might include: The recommended dosage is [30-90 mg per day](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3178961/) Muscle fatigue is a [common symptom](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/98/3/E509/2536948) in people who do not get enough [vitamin D](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/161618.php). More than [50% of people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356951/) Certain people are more at risk of being deficient than others, including: - older adults - people with darker skin - people who get less sun exposure, such as those in colder climates - people with [obesity](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/info/obesity/how-much-should-i-weigh.php) The researchers behind a [ 2013 study](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/98/3/E509/2536948) found that people with low vitamin D levels had improved muscle efficiency after they received treatment for the vitamin deficiency. There is also a link between [depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933.php) and low levels of vitamin D. Fatigue is a common symptom of depression. One review highlighted a Norwegian study in which more than 400 people with overweight received [20,000 or 40, 000 international units of vitamin D weekly](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356951/) B vitamins help create energy in cells. Having a deficiency in B vitamins can [cause fatigue](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772032/) Older adults, vegetarians, and vegans may be at [higher risk of a vitamin B-12 deficiency](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4772032/) [anemia](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/158800.php), making people feel low in energy. Some athletes take vitamin B-12 supplements to boost their performance. However, [research does not indicate](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminB12-HealthProfessional/) Asking a doctor about a potential deficiency and maintaining good levels of vitamin B-12 may help a person treat low energy that is due to a deficiency. Creatine is an amino acid that occurs mostly in red meat and seafood. Creatine supplementation increases creatine stores in the muscles and can help improve performance during exercise. A review in the [Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-017-0173-z) - improving recovery - helping prevent sports-induced injuries - reducing the risk of heat-related illness, such as [dehydration](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/153363.php), when exercising The study authors also found that both long and short term supplementation is safe and well-tolerated for healthy people of all ages. It is important to note that some of the researchers received funding from or had affiliations with supplement manufacturers. A deficiency in iron can lead to a lack of energy and fatigue. People who have a [higher risk](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/iron-deficiency-anemia) - are menstruating - are pregnant or breastfeeding - are vegetarian or vegan - exercise intensely, especially if female - donate blood regularly [One study](http://www.cmaj.ca/content/184/11/1247.full) looked at unexplained fatigue in menstruating women. The participants who supplemented with iron over 12 weeks had a 47.7% decrease in fatigue. Those in the placebo group had a decrease of just 28.8%. Eating iron-rich foods with vitamin C can [increase absorption](https://www.eatright.org/food/vitamins-and-supplements/types-of-vitamins-and-nutrients/iron), so people should be sure to consume enough fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits and leafy greens. L-theanine is a naturally occurring amino acid in tea. Combining L-theanine with caffeine may help increase energy and cognitive performance. A small [2017 study](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1028415X.2016.1144845?journalCode=ynns20) looked at the effects of L-theanine and L-theanine with caffeine on attention levels in 20 healthy males. The researchers found that high doses of L-theanine with caffeine improved attention levels the most. Another [study from 2010](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/147683010X12611460764840?src=recsys) found that a combination of 97 mg of L-theanine and 40 mg of caffeine improved cognitive performance in young adults. The participants reported feeling less tired with increased alertness. Vitamins and supplements can cause mild side effects in some people. If a person experiences any severe side effects from supplements, they should stop using them straight away and see a doctor.
