Food and Drug Administration](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454785&version=Patient&language=English)for the treatment of cancer or any other medical [condition](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000651193&version=Patient&language=English)(see Question 8). Questions and Answers About Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup - What is Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup? \"Selected Vegetables\" and \" [Sun's Soup](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000446552&version=Patient&language=English)\" are names given to several different mixtures of vegetables and [herbs](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000463714&version=Patient&language=English)that are being studied as treatments for [cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&version=Patient&language=English)and other medical [conditions](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000651193&version=Patient&language=English), including [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044365&version=Patient&language=English)(AIDS). The following versions have been [Scutellaria barbata](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000285746&version=Patient&language=English)(barbat skullcap). This mixture is not sold in the United States. - Freeze-dried Selected Vegetables (DSV), a [freeze-dried](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044150&version=Patient&language=English)mixture of vegetables and herbs sold in the United States as a [dietary supplement](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000373932&version=Patient&language=English). DSV is reported to contain Olive. - Sesame seed. - Parsley. - Frozen Selected Vegetables (FSV), a frozen mixture of fresh vegetables and herbs, sold in the United States as a dietary [supplement](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045916&version=Patient&language=English). It contains the same vegetables and herbs as in DSV. - Original Mixture - What is the history of the discovery and use of Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup as a complementary and alternative treatment for cancer? The vegetable and herb mixture now called Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup was developed to treat cancer. - In the mid-1980's, the developer created the mixture to treat a relative who was [diagnosed](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046450&version=Patient&language=English)with [stage IV non-small cell lung cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045144&version=Patient&language=English)and not helped by [standard treatment](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044930&version=Patient&language=English). The mixture contained shiitake mushroom, mung bean, and the herbs Hedyotis diffusa and barbat skullcap. The developer believed these ingredients contain substances that may block the growth of cancer [cells](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046476&version=Patient&language=English)and/or help the body's [immune system](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046356&version=Patient&language=English)attack cancer cells. The relative was reported to be alive and free of cancer more than 13 years later. Three more patients with [advanced cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000478743&version=Patient&language=English)were treated with a combination of shiitake mushroom and mung bean. These patients were also reported to benefit from the treatment. - In 1992, the developer applied for a patent for Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup as an herbal treatment of cancer. The developer reported on [animal studies](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454774&version=Patient&language=English)done in mice (see Question 5). The developer then began doing [clinical trials](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045961&version=Patient&language=English)(see Question 6) to test Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup in cancer patients. - In 1995, the developer was awarded a patent for Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup. Many of the vegetables and herbs in Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup were chosen because previous research and [traditional Chinese medicine](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000449722&version=Patient&language=English)suggest they contain anticancer [phytochemicals](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044709&version=Patient&language=English)(substances found in plants that may have effects on the body). These include substances such as [protease inhibitors](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045977&version=Patient&language=English), [plant sterols](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044161&version=Patient&language=English), and [isoflavones](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046660&version=Patient&language=English). These ingredients may block the growth of cancer cells and/or improve the way the body's immune system attacks cancer cells. - In the mid-1980's, the developer created the mixture to treat a relative who was - What is the theory behind the claim that Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup is useful in treating cancer? The theory is that certain ingredients in Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup may contain phytochemicals that have significant anticancer effects in humans. One of these ingredients is shiitake mushroom. [Lentinan](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044157&version=Patient&language=English), which is taken from shiitake mushroom, has been used in Japan to treat [stomach](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000445087&version=Patient&language=English)and [colon cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044237&version=Patient&language=English)after [surgery](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045570&version=Patient&language=English). Treatment with lentinan is reported to help patients with [stomach cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000445087&version=Patient&language=English)live longer and have a better [quality of life](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045417&version=Patient&language=English). Lentinan may not be easily absorbed by the body from food, so it is usually given by [injection](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044678&version=Patient&language=English). Other substances in shiitake mushroom that are more easily used by the body from food have shown anticancer activity in animal tests. - How is Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup administered? Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup is eaten as part of the [diet](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044660&version=Patient&language=English). Daily [doses](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044664&version=Patient&language=English)of either 1 [ounce](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000330174&version=Patient&language=English)of the DSV (mixed with water or other soup) or 10 ounces of the FSV were used in clinical trials. - Have any preclinical (laboratory or animal) studies been conducted using Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup? Few [preclinical studies](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044517&version=Patient&language=English)have been done with Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup. Research in a laboratory or using animals is done to find out if a [drug](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000348921&version=Patient&language=English), procedure, or treatment is likely to be useful in humans. Preclinical studies are done before clinical trials (in humans) are begun. A small number of mice were injected with [tumor](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046634&version=Patient&language=English)cells and fed either standard food or food mixed with one or more ingredients from Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup. The researchers reported that the growth of tumors was slower in the mice that were fed the Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup ingredients, compared to the mice that ate standard food. The tumor growth was slowest when the mice were fed both mung bean and shiitake mushroom. - Have any clinical trials (research studies with people) of Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup been conducted? Clinical trials using Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup to treat cancer have been done with small numbers of patients. These patients received other types of treatment, either before or during treatment with Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup, and different vegetable mixtures were used in the different studies. The results of these trials were compared with published information on similar patients who did not receive Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup. Most patients receiving the vegetable mixtures lived longer, were better able to carry out their daily activities, and either gained weight or did not lose weight. In some patients who ate Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup, tumor growth slowed or the tumor completely went away. Because patients in these trials received other treatments, it is not known if their [responses](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044085&version=Patient&language=English)were caused by Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup, the other treatments, or both. None of the trials were [randomized](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045858&version=Patient&language=English)or [controlled](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044014&version=Patient&language=English). Randomized clinical trials give the highest level of evidence. In randomized trials, volunteers are put randomly (by chance) into one of 2 or more groups that compare different treatments. In a controlled trial, one group (called the [control group](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044149&version=Patient&language=English)) does not receive the new treatment being studied. The control group is then compared to the groups that receive the new treatment, to see if the new treatment works. Randomized controlled trials, enrolling larger numbers of people, are needed to confirm the results of studies done so far on Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup. One randomized clinical trial (NCT00246727) of patients with [stage IIIB](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045367&version=Patient&language=English)or [stage IV non-small cell lung cancer](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000045144&version=Patient&language=English)was conducted. The trial compared the survival of patients receiving Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup with patients receiving a [placebo](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046688&version=Patient&language=English)(inactive substance). Both groups received treatment with [supportive care](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046609&version=Patient&language=English), such as [radiation therapy](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000044971&version=Patient&language=English), surgery, or [palliative care](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000269448&version=Patient&language=English). - Have any side effects or risks been reported from Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup? No harmful [side effects](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000046580&version=Patient&language=English)or risks have been reported in the use of Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup. Some patients felt full or bloated after eating the dry form, but patients who ate the frozen mixture did not report this. - Is Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a cancer treatment in the United States? The [FDA](http://www.cancer.gov/Common/PopUps/definition.aspx?id=CDR0000454786&version=Patient&language=English)has not approved any form of Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup for the treatment of cancer or any other medical condition. Well-designed clinical trials that test identical mixtures of vegetables and herbs are needed to prove whether Selected Vegetables/Sun's Soup is useful in treating cancer. About This PDQ Summary About PDQ Physician Data Query (PDQ) is the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) comprehensive cancer information database. The PDQ database contains summaries of the latest published information on cancer prevention, detection, genetics, treatment, supportive care, and complementary and alternative medicine. Most summaries come in two versions. The health professional versions have detailed information written in technical language. The patient versions are written in easy-to-understand, nontechnical language. Both versions have cancer information that is accurate and up to date and most versions are also available in [Spanish](https://www.cancer.gov/espanol/publicaciones/pdq). PDQ is a service of the NCI. The NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIH is the federal government's center of biomedical research. The PDQ summaries are based on an independent review of the medical literature. They are not policy statements of the NCI or the NIH. Purpose of This Summary This PDQ cancer information summary has current information about the use of selected vegetables/Sun's soup in the treatment of people with cancer. It is meant to inform and help patients, families, and caregivers. It does not give formal guidelines or recommendations for making decisions about health care. Reviewers and Updates Editorial Boards write the PDQ cancer information summaries and keep them up to date. These Boards are made up of experts in cancer treatment and other specialties related to cancer. The summaries are reviewed regularly and changes are made when there is new information. The date on each summary (\"Updated\") is the date of the most recent change. The information in this patient summary was taken from the health professional version, which is reviewed regularly and updated as needed, by the [PDQ Integrative, Alternative, and Complementary Therapies Editorial Board](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/pdq/editorial-boards/cam). Clinical Trial Information A clinical trial is a study to answer a scientific question, such as whether one treatment is better than another. Trials are based on past studies and what has been learned in the laboratory. Each trial answers certain scientific questions in order to find new and better ways to help cancer patients. During treatment clinical trials, information is collected about the effects of a new treatment and how well it works. If a clinical trial shows that a new treatment is better than one currently being used, the new treatment may become \"standard.\" Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Clinical trials can be found online at [NCI's website](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials).

General CAM Information Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM)\u2014also called integrative medicine\u2014includes a broad range of healing philosophies, approaches, and therapies. A therapy is generally called complementary when it is used in addition to conventional treatments; it is often called alternative when it is used instead of conventional treatment. (Conventional treatments are those that are widely accepted and practiced by the mainstream medical community.) Depending on how they are used, some therapies can be considered either complementary or alternative. Complementary and alternative therapies are used in an effort to prevent illness, reduce stress, prevent or reduce side effects and symptoms, or control or cure disease. Unlike conventional treatments for cancer, complementary and alternative therapies are often not covered by insurance companies. Patients should check with their insurance provider to find out about coverage for complementary and alternative therapies. Cancer patients considering complementary and alternative therapies should discuss this decision with their doctor, nurse, or pharmacist as they would any type of treatment. Some complementary and alternative therapies may affect their standard treatment or may be harmful when used with conventional treatment. Evaluation of CAM Therapies It is important that the same scientific methods used to test conventional therapies are used to test CAM therapies. The National Cancer Institute and the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) are sponsoring a number of clinical trials (research studies) at medical centers to test CAM therapies for use in cancer. Conventional approaches to cancer treatment have generally been studied for safety and effectiveness through a scientific process that includes clinical trials with large numbers of patients. Less is known about the safety and effectiveness of complementary and alternative methods. Few CAM therapies have been tested using demanding scientific methods. A small number of CAM therapies that were thought to be purely alternative approaches are now being used in cancer treatment\u2014not as cures, but as complementary therapies that may help patients feel better and recover faster. One example is acupuncture. According to a panel of experts at a National Institutes of Health (NIH) meeting in November 1997, acupuncture has been found to help control nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and pain related to surgery. However, some approaches, such as the use of laetrile, have been studied and found not to work and to possibly cause harm. [The NCI Best Case Series Program](https://cam.cancer.gov/indentifying_novel_cam_therapies/best_case_series_program.htm) which was started in 1991, is one way CAM approaches that are being used in practice are being studied. The program is overseen by the NCI's Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM). Health care professionals who offer alternative cancer therapies submit their patients' medical records and related materials to OCCAM. OCCAM carefully reviews these materials to see if any seem worth further research. Questions to Ask Your Health Care Provider About CAM When considering complementary and alternative therapies, patients should ask their health care provider the following questions: - What side effects can be expected? - What are the risks related to this therapy? - What benefits can be expected from this therapy? - Do the known benefits outweigh the risks? - Will the therapy affect conventional treatment? - Is this therapy part of a clinical trial? - If so, who is the sponsor of the trial? - Will the therapy be covered by health insurance?
