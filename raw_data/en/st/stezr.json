When facing a cancer diagnosis and treatment decisions, that foundation is sometimes tested, requiring spiritual care to avoid adding to the level of distress for patients and families. However, anyone interested in reinforcing their spiritual health will find the staff of the Michigan Medicine's Spiritual Care Department ready to support them. Spiritual Counseling You might consider consulting with a chaplain for any of the following reasons: - Spirituality and/or religion are important to you - Prayer and/or religious rituals are important to you - Religious or spiritual questions have surfaced - You are facing difficult decisions, including those related to diagnosis and treatment - You are struggling with life's \"why\" questions - You are anxious or scared - You have received bad news - You are grieving - You have an unexplainable urge to explore life's deeper issues - You need assistance connecting or reconnecting with the religious traditions of your past Chaplains are clinically trained to listen to these and other issues and provide spiritual care and assist patients in working through the distress that can accompany disease and treatment. Chaplains are sensitive to differences in culture, religion and lifestyles. They represent a variety of religions and faith traditions, and can help you connect with faith leaders of all denominations in the community. Chaplains are available Monday through Friday, 8am - 5pm for consultations with patients in the hospital as well as in outpatient clinic and infusion settings. A chaplain is on call after hours and on weekends for urgent needs as well. To request a chaplain consult, ask a member of your care team or call 734-936-4041 during regular business hours. After hours, ask a nurse to page the on-call chaplain. More information about counseling, spiritual care, chapels, quiet rooms and worship services is available on the [Social Work & Spiritual Care page](http://www.uofmhealth.org/patient-visitor-guide/counseling-spiritual-services), part of the University of Michigan Patient and Visitor Guide.
