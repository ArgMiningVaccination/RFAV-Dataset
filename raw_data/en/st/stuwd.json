The hearing at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Louisiana included arguments from the Justice Department and drugmaker Danco Laboratories on one side and a group of doctors and medical professionals who oppose abortion on the other. The three-judge panel heard the case after the Supreme Court said the status quo on mifepristone's availability should remain in place while the appeals process plays out.

Referring to the practice as \"the telemedicine situation\" and the \"mail business thing on the computer,\" Elrod expressed skepticism that these remote options are safe.

Judge James Ho, an appointee of former President Trump, expressed doubts about the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) use of an expedited process to approve mifepristone more than 20 years ago. The accelerated approval process is typically reserved for medications used to treat serious or life-threatening illnesses. \"Pregnancy is not a serious illness,\" Ho said, later adding, \"When we celebrated Mother's Day, were we celebrating illness?\" (Shapero, 5/17) [ Reuters: Factbox: Who Are The Judges Who Will Decide The Appeal Over The Abortion Pill? ](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judges-who-will-decide-appeal-over-abortion-pill-2023-05-17/) All three of the judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel that will hear the Biden administration's appeal to keep the abortion pill mifepristone on the market are staunchly conservative, with a record of opposing abortion rights.

Meanwhile, Illinois moves to lock in its access to abortions. In other news, Donald Trump attempts to take credit for the end of Roe v. Wade (but sidesteps an answer on supporting a six-week ban). [ CNN: South Carolina House Passes Six-Week Abortion Ban After Hours Of Contentious Debate ](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/17/politics/south-carolina-abortion-debate/index.html) South Carolina House members approved a controversial bill late Wednesday that would ban most abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy, after having spent the last two days in contentious debate on the legislation. Lawmakers had been called back for a special session this week by Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to continue work on Senate Bill 474, known as the \"Fetal Heartbeat and Protection from Abortion Act,\" which bans most abortions after early cardiac activity can be detected in a fetus or embryo, which can commonly be detected as early as six weeks into pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.
