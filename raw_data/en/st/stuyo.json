There are MANY fads out there when it comes to health products. So you may wonder, \"Can a crystal really bring me good health?\" If you're someone who likes to \"trust the science,\" you may be disappointed to hear that there is currently no scientific evidence to back up the [healing powers of crystals](https://www.theyoganomads.com/crystals-for-pain/). In fact, many medical professionals and researchers believe that crystal healing is simply a cause of the \"placebo effect.\" However, what is interesting is that new [research from Stanford](https://scopeblog.stanford.edu/2018/06/18/mind-this-research-reveals-the-power-of-the-mind/) supports the theory that our minds can help us heal and live long and healthy lives. For example, researchers found that people who believe doing physical work in a job counts as exercise live longer lives than their colleagues who do not see their job as exercise. In addition, researchers recorded an increase in study participants' blood pressure after telling them a drink they had just consumed contained caffeine when it didn't. Therefore, when it comes to crystal healing, it is likely a case of if you believe a gemstone can improve your health, it probably can. However, if you wear a crystal bracelet when you don't believe in its powers, you likely won't observe any healing progress, no matter how many days you wear it.

By raising your vibration, Clear Quartz has clear energetic blockages to aid in the healing of many physical and emotional ailments. Clear Quartz stimulates the immune system and seeks to bring the body back into alignment after you have been ill. Because of its ability to help heal various ailments, this is my go-to crystal whenever I have an unknown illness or virus. I often place a clear quartz [tumbled stone](https://www.amazon.com/ZenQ-Tumbled-Crystal-Healing-Natural/dp/B07YQ4VRY5/ref=sr_1_10?crid=2EY5QEEXWHTJO&keywords=clear+quartz&qid=1684900063&sprefix=clear+quar%2Caps%2C432&sr=8-10&tag=theyoganomads-20) on my forehead at the first sign of a fever. As a fever is our body's fighting response to a viral or bacterial infection, using this master healer crystal can help to boost your immune system's fighting power so that, hopefully, the virus does not win the battle!

This multi-healing stone improves blood circulation to help lower inflammation, heal infections, prevent blood clots, and speed up the healing of wounds. Working with bloodstones can be a holistic alternative medicine to complement medical treatment against blood-related cancers such as leukemia. In a more general sense, bloodstone improves physical strength and feelings of vitality. This is why it's an ideal stone to use when you're feeling weak after an illness. Serving as a \" pick-me-up, \" it regulates and stimulates blood flow and sends oxygen and nutrients to the body's vital organs. This results in more energy and vigor. If you are battling or recovering from an illness, wear a [bloodstone pendant](https://www.amazon.com/Bloodstone-Gemstone-Hexagonal-Necklace-High-Grade/dp/B09YR4C959/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=Bloodstone&qid=1684901961&sr=8-7&tag=theyoganomads-20) for all-day healing. Or, if you have an open wound, use a bloodstone [crystal wand](https://www.amazon.com/AMOYSTONE-African-Bloodstone-Obelisk-Meditation/dp/B0BPH9133T/ref=sr_1_11?keywords=Bloodstone&qid=1684902039&sr=8-11&tag=theyoganomads-20), pointing it at the injury as you envision the crystal's powers rapidly healing it.

It is known for its ability to remove toxins from the physical body and reduce negative thoughts from the mind. It is equally powerful for the energetic body, as it is said that black tourmaline can [block negative energy](https://www.theyoganomads.com/beads-for-protection/) from entering your aura.

In addition, it inspires physical and inner strength, courage, and vitality to bring you back up to \"100%\" following an illness or injury.
