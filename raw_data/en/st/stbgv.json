Come and get it.\" - Dr. Michelle Brannick What is Naturopathic Medicine? At Brannick Clinic we practice Naturopathic Medicine - the most powerful primary care medicine there is. Naturopathic Medicine combines centuries-old natural therapies with the most current medical science to attain optimal health for the whole patient - mind, body spirit - and the whole family, from prenatal health to geriatric care. It is a progressive and comprehensive system of medicine that places equal emphasis on becoming healthy and staying healthy. TESTIMONIAL: \"If you believe healthcare should be individually focused, this is the place.\" - W.D. The Six Principles of Naturopathic Medicine Treat the Whole Person Recognizing the numerous influences on our health - physical, emotional, genetic, spiritual, environmental - and their innumerable combinations, naturopathic physicians treat each patient as a distinct individual. The Healing Power of Nature The most formidable tool in a naturopathic physician's toolbox is the body's own ability to heal itself. Identify & Treat the Causes Naturopathic medicine views symptoms as an indication of a deeper problem. So rather than simply suppressing the symptom, the focus is on treating the source of the problem. First Do No Harm Minimizing the potential for side effects, naturopathic therapies are gentle, nontoxic and noninvasive. The Doctor as Teacher Naturopathic physicians believe informed patients become more active participants in their own health and might even inspire others to do the same! Prevention One size does not fit all when it comes to health. Naturopathic physicians customize each patient's health regimen, then partner with him or her to attain it. Prevention is the best strategy for better health! TESTIMONIAL: \"Six days after starting your treatment plan all the pain was gone and I was sleeping again!... You're a miracle worker!\" - M. Z. "}
