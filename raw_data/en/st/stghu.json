Some of them are just so heavily fragranced with chemicals they can even trigger headaches and nausea. Due to my own health battles, I switched to all natural cleaning several years ago, and I absolutely love it. I really got into essential oils, and I have found them to be highly effective and enjoyable to use.

If you are a generally healthy person, you may not have had to put much thought into whether or not you are cleaning your home in an ecological manner or safe manner. Nevertheless, none of our human bodies were made to be exposed to these chemicals.

Manage Pet Hair And Allergens Dogs and cats as companions are lovely pets to have. But their adventures outside, coupled with the genetic makeup of their fur, can often be a problem for [those sensitive to pet hair](https://www.self.com/story/allergic-to-pet-tips) and the outdoors. But, unless they pose a significant risk to your home and family's health, it's unlikely you're going to want to rehome your pets. As a remedy, there are ways to limit a pet's shedding n the house. And solutions to prevent pets from rubbing the pollen they've accumulated onto their fur indoors. The options are to: - Designate rooms in the home which pets can and can't explore, rest, and play. Ideally, bedrooms should be off-guard. As no dog or cat can resist jumping on the bed. Which causes the sheets to become contaminated with allergens. Instead, why not limit pets to the downstairs area of the home. - Keep pets indoors on days when the pollen count is high. [Use Pollen.com](https://www.pollen.com/)to survey your local areas pollen count each day. - Regularly groom and wash your pets with gentle, all-natural shampoo. - Wash pet areas and bedding regularly, to avoid an excess of dirt, debris, and fur gathering in your home.

If you choose to go vegan, the negative impact is reduced even more. Although I still eat some animal products, due to food allergies my consumption of animal products is limited.
