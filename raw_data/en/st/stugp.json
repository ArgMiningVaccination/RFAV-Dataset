The Pediatric Integrative Medicine in Residency (PIMR) program was designed to address this training gap. The PIMR program is a 100-hour online educational curriculum, modeled on the successful Integrative Medicine in Residency program in family medicine. Preliminary data on site characteristics, resident experience with and interest in IM, and residents' self-assessments of perceived knowledge and skills in IM are presented. The embedded multimodal evaluation is described. Less than one-third of residents had IM coursework in medical school or personal experience with IM. Yet most (66%) were interested in learning IM, and 71% were interested in applying IM after graduation. Less than half of the residents endorsed pre-existing IM knowledge/skills. Average score on IM medical knowledge exam was 51%. Sites endorsed 1-8 of 11 site characteristics, with most (80%) indicating they had an IM practitioner onsite and IM trained faculty. Preliminary results indicate that the PIMR online curriculum targets identified knowledge gaps. Residents had minimal prior IM exposure, yet expressed strong interest in IM education. PIMR training site surveys identified both strengths and areas needing further development to support successful PIMR program implementation.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2015-03-17", "cleaned_text": "Pediatric Integrative Medicine in Residency (PIMR): Description of a New Online Educational Curriculum [https://doi.org/10.3390/children2010098](https://doi.org/10.3390/children2010098) [Pediatric Medicine: An Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-children-02-00098)]. IM has unique potential in pediatrics, where acquisition of healthy habits may confer lifelong benefits. [2](#B2-children-02-00098), [3](#B3-children-02-00098)]. A 2005 Institute of Medicine statement recommended that health professional schools include education on complementary medicine at all training levels [ [4](#B4-children-02-00098)], highlighting the need for physician education. Guidelines on IM education have been published for medical students and family medicine residents [ [5](#B5-children-02-00098), [6](#B6-children-02-00098), [7](#B7-children-02-00098)]. Fellowship competencies exist for IM [ [8](#B8-children-02-00098)], and Board certification is now available for physicians [ [9](#B9-children-02-00098)]. [10](#B10-children-02-00098)]. A 200-hour online IM curriculum (Integrative Medicine in Residency, IMR) developed in 2008 [ [11](#B11-children-02-00098)] is now used by more than 900 residents and 50 faculty members at 42 residencies. [12](#B12-children-02-00098)]. Pediatricians' desire for education about complementary therapies was documented in an American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) members' survey (n = 733) [ [2](#B2-children-02-00098), [13](#B13-children-02-00098)]. [3](#B3-children-02-00098)]. This gap presented an opportunity to design, implement, and evaluate a pilot program (Pediatric Integrative Medicine in Residency, PIMR). Alignment of the curriculum with newly developed Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies facilitated introduction of material on empathy, self-regulation skills, and the importance of self-care in residency training [ [14](#B14-children-02-00098)]. 2. Methods 2.1. Curriculum Development [15](#B15-children-02-00098)], competencies in IM [ [8](#B8-children-02-00098)], literature review of pediatric IM topics, and input from nationally recognized pediatric faculty. The curriculum provides: (1) an introduction to pediatric IM; (2) a review of foundational topics; and (3) case-based IM management of common conditions. Content was piloted at the University of Arizona pediatric residency then refined based on faculty and resident feedback and a needs assessment questionnaire distributed to faculty and residents at two academic pediatric training programs. Refinements included emphasis on self-care, case-based learning, and intake and treatment planning. Authors Sites and Selection [16](#B16-children-02-00098). Sites vary in annual class size from 9 to 28 residents. 2.3. Measures 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. A.
