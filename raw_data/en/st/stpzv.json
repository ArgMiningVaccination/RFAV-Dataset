And there is no shortage of festive fun to get you in the holiday spirit! Be sure to check our various McHenry County holiday guides for [Christmas parades](https://mchenrylife.com/magazine/christmas-parades-mchenry-county/), [tree lightings & light displays](https://mchenrylife.com/magazine/christmas-tree-lighting-around-mchenry-county/), where to see [Santa](https://mchenrylife.com/magazine/pictures-with-santa-mchenry-county/), and getting a [local tree farm Christmas tree](https://mchenrylife.com/magazine/christmas-tree-farms-guide-for-mchenry-county/). We kicked off the start of our Christmas season with a trip to downtown Crystal Lake for a mega dose of holiday activities! We just caught the end of the annual Festival of Lights Parade. Unfortunately, with only about 10 minutes left. This quickly transitioned to the tree lighting, which was moved to the tree in the middle of the Brink Street Market. I'm not sure there was much ceremony as it was all lit up by the time I got to it, which wasn't long after the parade ended. Just about as quickly, Santa and Mrs. Claus were ushered through the crowd to take their seats in the Santa House, also located in the Brink Street Market. Santa will be at the [Santa House](https://mchenrylife.com/events/community-social-events/crystal-lake/santa-house-visits/) right up till just before Christmas, but don't wait until the last minute! From there, like many others, we made our way down Williams Street to Christmas Tree Lane in Depot Park, which has once again been transformed into Peppermint Park for the holidays. Christmas Tree Lane features Christmas trees that have been decorated by local businesses and organizations. It's a great mix of decorations, many themed, and always fun to wander through with a warm beverage on a chilly night. While the parade has come and gone, the Crystal Lake Christmas tree is still there to be admired, and [Christmas Tree Lane](https://mchenrylife.com/events/community-social-events/crystal-lake/christmas-tree-lane/) is scheduled to be set up through December. In the meantime, enjoy some photos...and next time I'll be sure to double-check my shutter speed first! McHenry Life Experiences Newsletter Want to be in the know, alerted about giveaways, and more?
