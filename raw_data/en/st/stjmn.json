Given the complexity of the disorder, and the fact that symptoms and severity vary, there are probably many causes. The term \"Spectrum\" refers to the wide range of symptoms associated with the disorder. Scientist argue that both genetics and environmental factors play a role; and in recent times there has been wide scale discussion on whether or not a link exists between the disorder and childhood vaccines. It is my belief that Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has no single known cause but that there is a culprit exploiting environmental factors, genetics and even vaccines to cause the disorder. I am talking about demons also called spirits. These spirits have to be bombarded with prayer and the word of God to enable the kids to functionally. Prior to 2001 I knew nothing about the field of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). I stumbled on the field when I responded to an advertisement where a family with a special needs child was looking for someone to work with the child in exchange for living accommodation. I responded to the advertisement and and was offered the job. Working with this child opened up a new world for me and motivated me want to learn more about the field. To this end, I added Autism Studies to my Graduate Major of General Theoretical Psychology which enabled me to learn about the nature of ASD and the management of the various aberrant behaviors associated with the disorder. I believe that stumbling on this field of study was no coincidence because serving families with special needs kids has changed my life and theirs for the better. In 2013 I was ordained as a Pastor of young church called Bethel Apostolic Ministries International in Englewood New Jersey. I've been serving in this capacity for seven years. As a Pastor I began to understand more and more that behaviors are motivated by spirits called demons. I have also learnt from experience that when the behaviors that the special needs kids are displaying are brought under control the kids begin to function normally. I also learnt that spirits cannot be dealt with using only physical and theoretical measures, but spiritual methods need to be introduced as well. To this end, the word of God and prayer were added to my to my therapeutic arsenal. Over the past 15 years some of the families that I've worked with have told me that I have a gift for working with special needs kids, because they have seen tranformation in their kids lives in a short period of time. I am grateful for the vote of confidence. What these families do not know is that I have not just been using the secular approach to dealing with the behaviors of the kids but I have been praying for them and also declearing what the word of God says about them. There's a piece of God on the inside of every special needs child and God has no dysfunction or disorder. I see my clients as God sees them \u2014 whole. This approach has enabled me to see cognitive, social and emotional transformation in the lives of my clients, something that I live for. Having my feet in both the professional arena and the spiritual arena, and having worked in the field 15 years I feel equipped to share my understanding of nature of Autism Spectrum Disorder and how we can deal with it more effectivley. Every treatment modality must involve the word of God and prayer to eradicate the disorder. I have seen how my ecclectic approch of combining secular and spiritual methods to treat ASD has transformed the lives of families. I want the same thing to happen for you. If you have a special needs child, I encouraged you not to give up on your child. Begin to pray over your child and believe in his ability to function normally, in addition to using the secular method that are at your disposal. If this is done consistently you will begin to see meaningful results. Hang in there. A new day has dawned for you and your family. There is always hope in Jesus. "}
