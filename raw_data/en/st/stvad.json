Post-Cairo, with the changing paradigm shift of making programmes more relevant to people's needs, NGO participation and support has increased substantially. As the NGO programme has expanded in scope and coverage, capacity building of NGOs became an essential prerequisite to their effectiveness in improving the status of health of women and children. In December 1998, the MOHFW , Government of India, has launched the Mother NGO (MNGO) scheme as an effort towards forging partnership and collaboration with Non-Government Organizations. The MNGO scheme has been decentralized to State and District level and provides ample scope for MNGOs and Field NGOs (FNGO) to work in unserved and undeserved parts of all districts in the country. The scheme also addresses the issue of capacity building of NGOs by establishing an institutional mechanism of an Apex Resource Cell (ARC) and ten Regional Resource Centres (RRC). They will work towards strengthening technical and managerial skills of the MNGOs/FNGOs. The NGO Division of the MOHFW through its technical wing Apex Resource Cell with support from UNFPA has the mandate for capacity building of RRCs, who in turn will build capacities of MNGOS/FNGOs using a cascading model of training. In order to standardize content and training methodologies and bring about a consistency in the training of MNGOs/FNGOs throughout the country, and has developed a 'Training MINISTRY OF HEALTH & FAMILY WELFARE NIRMAN BHAVAN, NEW DELHI - 110011 Prasanna Hota Health & Tel. : ivThe has six key modules namely-Perspective Building on RCH, MCH (now include Service Delivery also), Baseline survey, Adult Learning Principles, Financial and Administration and Project Proposal Development. Each of the modules is further sub-divided into units. The units have been made user-friendly, participative and provide facilitators enough scope for being creative and innovative. Wherever necessary, case studies, stories, games, role-play and field visit have been used to make the sessions more interactive and meaningful. Different participatory training tools have been used throughout the manual. The manual also includes a section on 'How to use the Manual'. The users of this manual include RRC trainers, MNGO and FNGO staff. In addition, the manual can be used as a basic reference document. This TOT manual has largely drawn upon the GOI NRHM guidelines, RCH-II National PIP , National Population Policy 2000 and documents published by UNICEF , CARE and Save the Children on Material and Newborn Health.

They will train the Field Non- Government Organization (FNGO) staff on issues ranging from building the RCH perspective to development of FNGO and MNGO proposals. The FNGO staff can use the manual as a basic reference document as it includes guidelines, formats and handouts. The objective of the manual is to standardize content and training methodologies and bring about a consistency in the training of MNGOs/FNGOs throughout the country. The training manual consists of six modules that are sequentially arranged to enable trainers and trainees to understand and link basic concepts, policies and implementation guidelines. Therefore it is essential for all users to follow the sequence of the manuals and not use individual modules in one- off training sessions. It is important to maintain the suggested sequence for consistency and standardization. The six modules include 1. Perspective Building on Reproductive and Child Health 2. Service Delivery for Reproductive and Child Health 3. Data Collection for Identifying RCH status in the Community through Baseline Survey (BLS) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) 4. Adult Learning Principles, T eaching Methods and T eaching Aids 5. Finance and Administration 6. Project Planning, Budgeting, Proposal Development and Monitoring and Evaluation Each module in the manual has been further sub-divided into units and instructions have been provided in each unit on exactly how to train participants on the content of the unit. Each unit consists of the following: Objectives: These indicate the purpose of the unit. It is important that before starting the session each trainer clearly lays down the objective of the session. Expected Outcome : This section elaborates upon what is expected to be achieved at the end of the session. Manual for MNGOs xMethodology: Spells out the various methods that have been used in the unit to achieve its objectives and make the training participatory and interactive. The most commonly used methodologies in the manual are: case studies, group discussions, brainstorming sessions, quiz, games, story telling, short lectures, using power point presentations and field visit. Duration: Time taken to conduct the session is specified. About the unit/link with the previous units: This section establishes the link between the units of the manual and also highlights the importance of the unit in relation to the other units. It also introduces the unit to the trainer and helps the trainers, especially those who are part time facilitators, to understand the context in which the unit is being conducted. Training Aids: Refers to the various types of materials that are used while conducting the unit. The training aides range from case studies to stationery items such as flip charts, chart papers, markers etc. In a community setting, trainers are expected to use their creativity and available resources. When conducting district level workshops, trainers need to ensure that the required training aids are in place. Handouts: Throughout the manual several reference handouts have been provided. These handouts contain 1. Guidelines on schemes such as the Janani Suraksha Yojana, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) 2. Formats such as the Baseline Survey format and formats for MNGO/FNGO proposals 3. Reference material such as articles/abstracts from documents such as: Improving maternal, newborn and Child Health in the South East Asia region as reference for MCH topics, RCH 2 National PIP for RCH policies and strategies. Notes for the facilitator: These contain certain cues and tips for the trainers so as to facilitate the entire training of the unit. Notes for the facilitator contain the main points, which the trainer should keep in mind while conducting the training. At places these also specify various alternative methods or options that can be used by the trainer to conduct a particular activity for arriving at the e xpected outcome. It is also important for the trainers/facilitators to keep updating the data and content of the units as mentioned in the notes for the facilitator . For example the trainer should use the latest Rapid Household Survey conducted for data xion RCH. Trainers can use latest editions of the RCH 2 and NRHM mission documents as reference material for the session on positioning the role of MNGOs/FNGOs in RCH 2 and NRHM, Module 1- Unit 1.4. Evaluation of the training T o know the impact of the training and to assess the performance of both trainees and trainers, it is important to evaluate each session and the workshop as a whole. The most appropriate tool to assess the gain in knowledge and skills of the trainers is to conduct a pre and post-test. A pre and post-test questionnaire has been enclosed in the manual to facilitate the evaluation process. This can be modified and translated to suit the participant's needs. Apart from the pre and post-test questionnaire, it is important that a daily evaluation and a final evaluation of the training is conducted. A daily evaluation helps the trainers to learn from the feedback received on the sessions and modify/revise the next day's session. It is appropriate to discuss the results of every day's evaluation at the beginning of the next day and through a participatory process decide upon the revisions in the day's programme. Final evaluation is done at the end of the training to assess the entire training programme. This evaluation is mostly used to improve upon future training. Certain points that can be helpful while using the manual during training are T o develop a better understanding of the manual and its content, it would work best when translated into the local language Use of local case studies using the sample studies given in the module by the trainers will make the training more relevant to the trainees as they will be able to relate it to their work. It would be good to use State or District level data while relating to various RCH issues as it would have more meaning for the participants. Resource persons need to be chosen keeping in mind their field experience, communication and training skills. Apart from the games and exercises provided in the manual, the trainer should be innovative and replace these with similar local games and exercises.

Methodology Case studies and discussions Duration 1 hour 30 minutes About this unit This is the first unit of the module on Perspective Building in Reproductive and Child Health. For enhancing understanding on RCH, it is essential to first internalize the various factors that affect the health of mother and child. These factors could be a combination of social, cultural or economic issues. Training aids Case-studies - Laxmi's Story, Urmila's Story, Flip and Laxmi's stories 2. Comparison of Bio-medical and Social Approach Notes for the facilitator The socio-cultural and economic determinants that effect women's health in their field area Ask the participants to identify how these determinants affect women living in their field areas Why should the FNGOs be conscious of these determinants?The Social, Cultural and Economic Determinants of Women's HealthUnit 1.1Module 1 3Introduction (20 min): Facilitators Input and Brainstorming India is a country of great diversity with its 29 states and six union territories, all varying in language, social customs and traditions. There are regions in the country with a health profile comparable to developed countries and there are others that lag well behind. In India, women of reproductive age (15- 49 years) and children (below 15 years) constitute 60% of the total population. They comprise the vulnerable fraction of the population due to the risks connected with childbearing in case of women; and growth, development and survival in case of infants. Reduction of child mortality and improvement in maternal health are the major goals in the Millennium Declaration, to which India is a signatory . Another important goal in itself and with a direct impact on maternal and child health (MCH) is promotion of gender equality and empowerment of women. Additionally, one fifth of India's population is in the adolescent age group and yet to begin their reproductive lives. The socio-cultural economic determinants of maternal, newborn and child health are complex and wide ranging. A strong correlation exists between the social inequity and maternal and child health. This is one of the many challenges facing India1. It is keeping this above perspective in mind that we need to examine the status of women and child health in our local settings. Activity (70 Minutes) (Case discussion in groups - 30 min; presentation by 2 groups-20 min each) 1. Divide the participants into four groups 2. Give each group one of the two case studies and ask them to identify and discuss the different factors affecting the woman's and child's health 3. They will then note the responses in the following tabular form on the board or flip chart. Social Status of WomenEconomic CausesBeliefs and practicesHealth services related factors Each group displays their points on the fl ip chart. The facilitator carries out an analysis of the reasons. Participants are next told to consider a similar situation in their MNGO/FNGO area and suggest measures for supporting women like Urmila or Laxmi (Handout 1) . 1 Extracted from Make Every Mother and Child Count, WHO 2005Manual for MNGOs 4Case Studies Urmila's Story Urmila was a 23-year-old woman who studied up to 5th standard. At the age of 17 she was married to Mohan, an agricultural wage labourer. Urmila supports her husband in the field and also takes care of her cow and goat. At the age of 18 she delivered her first baby, a boy. When her son was one and a half years of age, she became pregnant. Urmila suffered from labour pain for more than 18 hours. The village daiwas called. She used various local methods for hastening the delivery , but failed. Finally, on the morning of the third day, the daiexpressed her inability to assist in the birth and told Mohan and his mother that Urmila should be tak en to the nearest hospital. Then Urmila with her husband went to the PHC from where she was referred to the District Hospital. Urmila was operated upon and had a baby girl. This baby weighed 2000 gms, had a feeble cry at birth and the doctor said that she was in a critical condition as Urmila had come in the late stages of labour to the hospital. The baby died within 12 hours of its birth. Urmila resumed her household chores within 20 days of returning home. She was very weak and depressed. There was no money in the house for buying rations and if she did not go to the fields how were they going to eat even one square meal? Mohan was earning only Rs 25 a day, and her mother-in- law looked after her son. If only she could meet the health worker and take her advice on delaying pregnancy. She was always anxious that she might get pregnant soon. Lakshmi's Story Lakshmi belongs to a village in central T amil Nadu, located about 15 km from the district headquarters. She is a 19-year-old agricultural wage labourer and belongs to the Scheduled Caste. Lakshmi grew up in another village. She was the first of four surviving children - three girls and a boy . Her father had a mistress. The family suffered a lot because of this. Lakshmi's mother had to go out to earn. Lakshmi was stopped from attending school after Class I. She would graze cattle and earn money, and when she was about 10 when she started working as an agricultural labourer. When Lakshmi was only 13, she was married off to her uncle's son, R amu, because there would be no dowry involved. Ramu was 24 and was also an agricultural wage labourer without any property. When they got married, Ramu told Lakshmi that times had changed, and that they should have only two children. If they had a boy and a girl, she should have an operation. But Handout 1Module 1 5somehow, Lakshmi did not conceive for two years. Her mother-in-law started abusing her. She conceived when she was 16. Her first pregnancy was very difficult. Her arms and legs and even her face were swollen, and something would cloud her vision. She would also vomit everything she ate, day after day. But she never went to see a doctor. People said this is how it is when one is pregnant. A baby girl was born to her. After the delivery in a government hospital, all these problems subsided. The second baby was also born in a hospital. But he died in a few days. He vomited once in the morning, was taken to hospital immediately, but died. The third was a daughter, and she died a few hours after birth. Some doctors said the baby had a heart problem while another said that Lakshmi was very weak. Some others said, that it was because she had married a close relative. But the baby was very small and only skin and bones. Lakshmi was heart-broken. After her third delivery, Lakshmi started emiting a foul-smelling white discharge frequently. She did not do anything about it, telling herself that this must be because of her weakness. Lakshmi started a vrat, fasting once a week for a healthy birth the next time. Her fourth baby was born recently, and is a boy. Lakshmi wanted to have a family planning operation, and so did R amu. But the doctors said that she was too weak, and sent her home. They asked her to come back after her health improved. Lakshmi is now desperate. She does not want to conceive immediately and wants to make sure that her son survives and grows into a healthy child. But knowing her husband she thinks sexual abstinence is not feasible. She is afraid that if she refuses, he will take another woman just like Lakshmi's father did. She wants her health to improve soon.

For activity 1, another optional activity, which could be conducted to understand the social discrimination, is the timeline and workload activity . This highlights how much time and work a woman does in comparison to a man during a day and yet eats less, rests less and is given less attention by family members1 Activities Activity 1 (60 min) 1. Ask or distribute the participants into four groups. 2. Give each group a set of four pictures of faceless persons engaged in some activity. 3. Ask the participants to decide whether they can decipher the sex of the individual and the reason for such a choice (10 min) 4. Each group will show 2 pictures to the larger group and explain the sex and reasons thereof. The groups should not repeat the same pictures (15 min) 5. Record the responses of the participants in the following tabular form. Initially do not write down the categories shown in column one (10 min) What was depicted Why it must be a Woman Why it must be a Man Division of work/ rolesCooking, bathing the childLifting a heavy load (coolie) Emotions Women cry Men get angry Socially Appropriate BehaviourSalwar kameez, sitting with head bowed downSitting with legs apart, wearing trousers Rights, Access and ControlSmall shopkeeper Big shopkeeper, being taught by a teacher Follow this activity by a short lecture or slide presentation giving various definitions of Sex, Gender, Gender Equality, Gender Equity and compare the biomedical and social approach to health. (25 min) Discuss with the participants about role reversal and what they feel about this? (whether men can also do the work that is shown for women, have the emotion that is shown for women. Is it possible for women to have the behaviour meant for men or have access to the resources that men have? Can biological aspects be interchanged)? Summarize that there are two kinds of differences between women and men - those which can be with both groups like dress, behaviour, work etc, and 1 For details of the activity refer to Gender Kunji, UNFPAModule 1 9those which cannot change - breast, penis, broad hips, etc. which are primarily biological. Thus the differences can be social and biological. The social differences are called gendergender while the biological difference can be called sex. Activity (Total 60 min) Power, Vulnerability and Empowerment Introduction (5 min) Power is usually considered to be the ability or resource of one individual or group to exercise their will over another individual or group. Thus a person or group is supposed to be able to dictate the action of another person or group. Power dynamics exist at all levels: within a household, at community level, among different castes, among people living within a village or a slum setting. Power and rights go hand-in-hand and there exists a very fine balance between the two. Absence or over-emphasis on any one of them results in an imbalance in the society. Let us see through the life cycle approach how both power and rights go hand- in-hand. Exercise On a Flip Chart draw the life cycle approach and go step-by-step discussing within your group a specific allotted stage of the life cycle of a human being: man/woman or both. The age groups on the life cycle are 0-10 years, 15-19 years, 15-49 years and 49+ years. These age group distributions are as per the demographic profile. The participants will work in groups (20 mins) Task Draw correlation at the allotted age group on the following points: Associated rights Illness Access to service (health, education etc) Quality of care Preferential treatment Violence Governance and role of civil society Any other determinants Each group will present their chart to the larger group followed by inputs from the larger group (5 min) total time for all groups-20 min Summarize the key points thus enabling the participants to appreciate and understand the crucial role and interface that exists between gender, power, rights and empowerment. (15 min)Manual for MNGOs 10Objectives Discuss the various stages of Community Mobilization/Participation for RCH State the importance of community mobilization and participation in the MNGO scheme State the importance of women's participation Outcome Enable the MNGO/FNGO partners in understanding the processes of community mobilization and participation Methodology Case Study followed by discussions Duration 1 hr 45 minutes (105 mins). Link with the previous units In this unit the discussions revolve around community participation and mobilization of RCH. Basic concepts like gender, rights and socio-cultural economic determinants should be understood in community settings. Community mobilization/participation are essential components of a scheme/ programme. Materials Key points on flip chart or slides, case study, flip board, white board and markers Notes for the facilitator Link this unit with the previous two units at the beginning of the session Ask participants to recall any instance where they were involved in community mobilization Identify steps of community mobilization, especially for a health intervention and the constraints faced while doing the same. Introduction (15 min) The declaration of Health For All by 2000 made by Alma Ata in 1978 drew attention to the widespread lack of health facilities for large numbers of people in different parts of the world. The strategy advocated was Primary Health Care with its strong emphasis on local community participation. It meant that people Unit 1.3 Community Mobilization/ParticipationModule 1 11should get involved both in the delivery of and decisions about the health services. In the present context of the MNGO scheme emphasis on community mobilization and participation continues to be an important component, moreso as the NGOs will be working in unserved and underserved areas1 where women and children continue to die because of ignorance, poverty, and lack of health care. Generally, women pay little attention to their health. For them the priorities are their husband, family, home and lastly themselves. The situation is further worsened by the fact that they are poor, illiterate, ignorant, cannot express their health needs, particularly, their reproductive health needs, and are marginalized within the household. It is in this context that mobilization and participation of women, men, adolescents in health programming will help the beneficiaries in identifying their health problems, diagnosing ways to address these problems, access services and avail of the services in a timely manner. Activity (90 min) Divide participants into four groups Distribute the case study to each of the participants Ask them to read the case and discuss the allotted question, write the answer on a chart paper (30 min). Each group along with the allotted question will also answer part (i) of question 4. However group 4 will answer both parts (i) and (ii) of the question. Each group presents (10 min) - total time for all groups-40 min Summarization of key points (20 min) 1 Those socio-economic areas which do not have access to healthcare services from the existing government health infrastructure, especially urban slums, tribal, hilly and desert areas including SC/ST habitations. The posts of MO.ANM.LHV have been vacant for more than 1 year, PHC ill- equipped and performance of RCH indicators poor. Manual for MNGOs 12Janaka is a field officer and has been working in her project area for 11 months now. After the inauguration of the project, she and her other two colleagues developed a work plan for mobilising women into groups in the field areas allotted to them. Each was allotted a population of 3000. Average number of households was 300 and family size was 5-7 persons per house. The households were spread over 20 villages. There were no anganwadi centres, ANM never visited these villages and there was no primary school in villages. Community mobilization and service delivery were the two strategies of the project. Janaka started work in village Lakhanpur. With the help of the local children she located the house of the village pradhan, explained her purpose for the visit and sought his cooperation for identifying a suitable space for the women's meetings. He offered her an empty shed in the village where she could sit and talk to the women. The following day, Janaka informed the women about the meeting and venue. Initially, the response from the women was poor, but this did not deter her from meeting them. The women assisted her in cleaning the shed, made alpana2alpana2alpana on the walls and together put up some pictures of mother and child. In consultation with the women, a date and time for the inauguration of the centre was fixed. The Pradhan was invited to light the lamp of their centre. The entire village had gathered and all were happy. Simultaneously, Janaka began similar activities in the cluster of villages surrounding Lakhanpur. From month two onwards, Janaka began her fortnightly group meetings. During the first 2-3 meetings the group was large; there were young girls and women of all ages including the older ones. Janaka spoke to them about the project and her organization. She told them that during the meetings she would give them important information about their health and for their children. Their organization was working with the Government doctors to organize medical aid for their village and she hoped this would be possible in a couple of months. During the course of the discussions, Janaka also gained an insight into the lives of the women. Only a few of the younger group had studied up to class five. Most women belonged to a very poor socio-economic class and worked as 2Alpana - local art work that is drawn on fl oor or walls of the houses in villages as decoration Alpana - local art work that is drawn on fl oor or walls of the houses in villages as decoration Alpana and good luck charms.Janaka's Story Handout Module 1 13wage labour in the larger fields or nearby brick kilns. They did all the household chores including collection of drinking water, cooking, caring for their livestock and looking after their children. Their men worked as wage labourers. Several misconceptions existed among the community, including that children are God's gift and it was not in their hands to limit their families. Pregnant women should eat less so that they can have small babies and delivery is easy . Delivery was usually in a cow shed or dark corner of the house. An older woman from the family or the local dai was called to assist during the delivery. Many were dai was called to assist during the delivery . Many were dai ignorant about tetanus toxoid injections. There was also the belief that the death of newborns was either due to the evil eye or God's punishment to the family and the village. During the course of these discussions she also felt that many were quiet and shy, while only a few women gave a positive response. Some even told her she was wasting her time. Even after working for four months in Lakhanpur , Janaka was unable to see any change in the attitude of the women. They came because she came, never met even once when she was not there, and only some showed a real interest. She shared her fears and apprehensions with the two other field officers and supervisor. They too had similar stories to tell. It was decided that the field officers should find out a little more about their common problems and difficulties and see if addressing key concerns could make a beginning. Janaka's supervisor came with her to Lakhanpur during her next fortnightly visit. The women were happy to see the supervisor, but told her that they needed work. They liked the idea of meeting in a group but only discussing health and talking of problems in health was not enough. Collecting potable water was a time consuming process and the women had to walk long distances to collect water for drinking and cooking. There was a great shortage in these parts and in another two months the wells would dry up. This was causing considerable anxiety to the women. Manual for MNGOs 14The project team jointly decided that they should explore the possibility of helping the village women overcome this critical bottleneck. Janak a took the pradhan and a few women to the BDO's office to discuss the water problem existing in the village. After discussing at the block headquarters, they were able to convince the authorities to allocate 2 hand pumps from the Government scheme for providing potable water to water-scarce villages. The BDO also explained that it was necessary to train local villagers in maintenance of the handpumps. Over the next two months, in collaboration with the water board, two women and one man from each of the villages were trained in hand pump boring, maintenance and chlorination of the water. They were given the necessary equipment. Initially, the work was started only in the identified village with women groups, but over the last 11 months 50% of villages in the project area were covered. The pradhans and women were very happy that the project staff had listened to their problem. Janaka found more active participation in the fortnightly meetings. Women started sharing health problems and more importantly seeking solutions for their common problems affecting a large number of them. They were able to suggest timings for the visits of medical teams to their village. Janaka also got an insight into the yearly work cycle of the women folk including their local festivals. She was also able to identify persons of influence in the village community. All this helped in maximizing satisfaction levels from the visits of medical teams from block and district headquarter. During the course of the next six months Janaka was able to successfully organize and conduct an antenatal camp.

Ensure recording the important points from the presentation from the final analysis. Introduction (20 min) The National Rural Health Mission lays emphasis on: Reduction of IMR and MMR, universalization of access to public health Unit 1.4 Positioning of MNGOs and FNGOs in RCH 2 and National Rural Health MissionManual for MNGOs 16services like women's health, child health water sanitation and hygiene, immunization and nutrition. Access to integrated comprehensive primary health care prevention and control of communicable and non- communicable diseases assuring population stabilization, gender and demographic balance and promotion of healthy life styles. In continuation the NRHM has also laid greater emphasis on NGO's capacity to adapt and participate in the implementation of NRHM strategies and achievement of its objective and goals. Hence it is necessary that MNGOs/ FNGOs identify and relate their roles to meet the above objectives. RCH 2 is viewed as a programme and not as a project and is for a period of 5 years (2005-2010). The immediate objective of RCH 2 is : T o address the unmet needs of contraception, health care infrastructure, health personnel and provide an integrated service delivery for basic reproductive and child health care, with special focus on states facing the biggest socio-demographic change The focus of the RCH 2 program will be on reducing the maternal mortality ratio, the infant mortality rate and the total fertility rate. It also aims to increase the couple protection rate and coverage of children through immunization. These are to be achieved through the provision of common essential pack age of service delivery mechanisms to be implemented by the RCH programme. The supply side strategies are to be oriented to the demand side sensitivities, to provide assured, equitable, responsive and quality services. The system would be shifted to gear itself up on a mission mode by using performance benchmarking and accountability tools1 Activity (100 min) (Group work - 30 min; presentation by 6 groups-10 min each; summarize 10 min) 1. Divide the participants into six groups (as per the RRC) 2. Provide core strategies of RCH2 and NRHM to the respective groups to use as reference material 3. Group members to first read the reference material and understand the public-private partnership concept for improving women's health. (30 minutes) 4. Each group to make a 10 minute presentation along the following heads: Community level Block and District level Linkages with the private sector Linkages at the state level Link with RRCs 5.

In this unit we shall discuss the status of Maternal Health in our country keeping in mind the different determinants discussed in Module 1 which affect the life of a woman. Training aids Overhead Projector, Flip charts/markers Handouts Reasons for maternal mortality and morbidity Notes for the facilitator Keep the presentation on the subject ready Make available latest Rapid Household Survey data/SRS data on maternal mortality, morbidity and distribution of maternal deaths by medical causes Emphasize the need for understanding maternal morbidity and mortality issues Use a case study of maternal death so that the participants can appreciate the three delays. Introduction/ Inputs Status of maternal Health (60 min) Steps 1. Discuss status of maternal health, maternal mortality rate, maternal mortality ratio, causes of maternal mortality and morbidity. See details in Handout 1 of this unitMaternal Health Unit 2.1Module 2 192. Link maternal status with the three-delay model stated below 3. Participants volunteer to present a story encompassing the three-delay model. Activity - 1 Story telling exercise Ask for 4-5 volunteers from the participants group A volunteer to speak for three minutes and the story line developed is continued by the next person. The story thus developed should encompass the three-delay model. Manual for MNGOs 20Improving child survival and maternal health indices is a priority area for policy makers, planners and various professionals. The socio-cultural determinants of maternal, newborn and child health have a cumulative effect over a lifetime. A correlation exists between the social inequity and maternal and child health. Examples are low literacy among women, son preference, sex ratio being unfavourable to females and discrimination against the girl child. About one third of women in India are married by the age of 15 and two-thirds by 18 years. The median age at first birth is 19.6 years (NFHS-2). Mothers who are younger than 20 years old at the time of first birth, were associated with a 1.7 times higher neonatal mortality rate and 1.6 times greater infant mortality rate than were mothers giving birth between 20-29 years. The links between pregnancy-related care and maternal mortality are well recognized. Over the last decade national programmes and plans have stressed the need for universal screening of pregnant women and operationalising essential and emergency obstetric care. Proper antenatal care can help ensure a favourable pregnancy outcome, a healthy mother and a healthy baby, but the coverage of antenatal care in India remains inadequate. Antenatal care, however, no matter how high the quality, must be backed up by the presence of a skilled health professional and a skilled birth attendant at the time of delivery. The distribution of skilled attendants and institutional births by states reveals an inverse relationship with maternal mortality ratios (MMRs), neonatal mortality rates (NMR) and infant mortality rates (IMR)1. Postpartum care, both immediate and late is a major concern in India. Only 16.5% women received a postpartum check up within two months of delivery (NFHS-2). Of these, less than one-third were seen within the first postpartum week, a period associated with high complication rate2. Maternal death (Mortality) and illness (Morbidity) Maternal mortality is defined as death of a pregnant woman occurring during her pregnancy or during the first 42 days after pregnancy. The five main medical causes of maternal deaths are the same for women all over the world. These are: 1 Improving Maternal, newborn and child health in the South-East Asia Region, page 29 WHO, 2005 2 Chapter -1 Improving Health outcomes page 101RCH-Phase -11, National Programme implementation plan, Status of Maternal Health Handout 1Module 2 21 Haemorhage Sepsis Hypertensive disorders Obstructed labour Unsafe abortion However, in developing countries, approximate 20 percent of deaths are due to indirect causes such as anaemia, and malaria that are aggravated by pregnancy. According to the Registrar General India Survey of causes of death (rural) 1998, causes of maternal deaths in India Mortality Rate The number of women who die while pregnant or within the first 42 days after childbirth or termination of pregnancy, from any causes related to or aggravated by pregnancy per 100,000 women of reproductive age in a given year . Number of maternal deaths in a year Number of maternal deaths in a year 100,000 of women of reproductive age in the population 100,000 Live Births in a year Maternal Mortality Ratio The number of women who die while pregnant or within the first 42 days after child birth or termination of pregnancy, from any causes related to or aggravated by pregnancy per 100,000 live births in a given year. Current Maternal Mortality Ratio for India is 407/100,000 live births (SRS, RGI, 1998) The National Goal is a nearly three fourths reduction in maternal deaths by the year 2010 Maternal Morbidity Maternal mortality is just the tip of the iceberg. For every woman who dies from the complications of pregnancy, between 30 and 100 more women suffer from acute complications that are painful and debilitating. In India women reporting complications due to pregnancy are 63.6%, during childbirth 37% and 44.4% during the postnatal period (IIPS 2001). These conditions vary in severity and include fistulas, lacerations, anaemia, uterine prolapse, damage to bladder or urethra, pelvic or urinary tract infections and infertility. Maternal morbidity such as anaemia, reduce economic and domestic productivity and compromise quality of life. Most women endure these conditions because they do not have access to quality reproductive services and/or because their families do not want them to be hospitalized for treatment. Manual for MNGOs 22A significant proportion of ill-health in women is related to their reproductive and sex lives. The NFHS-2 data reveals that 30% married women report at least one type of problem related to vaginal discharge, 18% report symptoms of urinary tract infection (UTI). Overall 36% women report either problems with vaginal discharge or symptoms of UTI. In addition to these morbidity conditions, many pregnant women are also HIV positive. With around 30 million pregnancies a year, and an estimated prevalence of 0.3%, around 100,000 HIV positive women become pregnant every year. Using a conservative vertical transmission rate of 30%, a new cohort of approximately 30,000 HIV infected infants is added every year (NACO, 2005). Mother to child transmission of HIV is by far the largest source of HIV infection in children below the age of 15 years. The three delays For every 100 women3 who become pregnant: 1. 40 will experience some complications during pregnancy, childbirth or the postpartum period 2. 15 will develop life-threatening complications, mostly around the time of birth 3. 5-15 will require a surgical intervention - usually a Caesarean section. Hospital records that give Caesarean rate as below 5 percent are an indication of either or (a) poor access to Emergency Obstetric Care Services (b) non availability of skilled provider- obstetrician or anaesthetist, (c) no blood bank or poor infrastructure. A helpful way to analyze the barriers to utilization is through the ' Three -delay Model\". Once a complication occurs, the key to saving a woman's life is to get her adequate care in time. The delays leading to death can be divided into: Delay 1: Delay in deciding to seek care Delay 2: Delay in reaching the health facility, and Delay 3: Delay in receiving treatment at the health facility Timings of maternal deaths The UNICEF document on Programming for Safe Motherhood states that: Fifty percent of all maternal deaths occur in the first twenty-four hours after delivery T wenty-five percent occur during pregnancy T wenty percent occur between day 2 and 7 after delivery and Five percent occur between weeks 2 and 6 after delivery. This further emphasizes the need to focus and improve postpartum care. 3 Programming for safe motherhood, causes of maternal illness and death, page 16. UNICEF , Oct 1999Module 2 23Combination of socio-cultural factors such as: Poor nutrition and associated factors Low status a women, and empowerment/decision making Frequent pregnancies/high fertility rate/short birth intervals Early marriage and adolescent pregnancies Heavy workload Reliance on traditional medicines and healers Desire for small babies - women eat/are given less quantity of food during pregnancy Emotional abuse/violence Delay in problem recognition and deciding to seek care due to: Traditional beliefs Low perceived risk Low knowledge of causes of death, danger signs and complications Poor ANC care or coverage Low women's status /participation in decision making Lack of birth planning/preparedness High rates of unattended homebirths and untrained attendants and Poor quality (perceived or actual) of health services Delay in reaching the health facility due to: Geographical distance Lack of resources to pay for services Inadequate communication/transportation systems and Inadequate knowledge of where to seek care and how to get to the facility Delay in receiving quality treatment at the health facility due to: Cumbersome administrative processes Lack of medicine, supplies, blood and equipment to treat complications Lack of competent, motivated personnel Lack of adequate supervision and management information systems and Lack of outreach and follow up mechanisms Source: Promoting Quality Maternal and Newborn Care: A reference Manual for Programme Managers-CARE, 1998*Factors contributing to maternal mortality and morbidity *The reasons stated above are not the causes for maternal morbidity or mortality , but contribute towards the same.Handout 2Manual for MNGOs 24Objectives 1. Understand the terms Essential Obstetric Care, Basic Obstetric Care and Comprehensive Obstetric Care 2. Discuss the different aspects of Essential Obstetric Care 3. Discuss the various interventions that FNGOs/MNGO can carry out to ensure that women in their project area are able to seek quality Essential Obstetric Care. Outcome MNGOs/FNGOs will be able to spell out the strategies and related activities that they can undertake to enable women and families make decisions to seek timely essential obstetric care and avert maternal deaths/illnesses. Methodology Group work on case followed by presentation Duration 120 min Link with previous unit We shall discuss the Maternal Health Interventions in this unit. These interventions address the issues raised in the previous unit on Status of Maternal Health. Training aids Presentations on key points, case study copies, chart paper and marker pens Handout Operational guidelines for implementation of Janani Suraksha Yojana and Guidelines on ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activists) Notes for the Facilitator Discuss in detail regarding the different aspects of Essential Obstetric Care and relate these with existing field situations Read beforehand the case study, Janani Suraksha Yojna, ASHA and identify linkages between the three. Ask all participants to read the JSY, ASHA documents the previous eveningUnit 2.2 Maternal Health Interventions Module 2 25Introduction/ Inputs Essential Obstetric Care (60 min) Maternal emergencies are extremely difficult to predict and therefore all women need access to Essential Obstetric Care. The interventions include: 1. Antenatal care 2. Birth planning, 3. Ensuring delivery with a skilled birth attendant, 4. Proper referral 5. Management of obstetrical complications (emergency obstetric care), 6. Post-partum monitoring and care. In guidelines1 jointly issued by WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA, it is recommended that for every 500,000 people there should be four facilities offering Basic Emergency Obstetric Care and one facility offering Comprehensive EOC. A facility providing BEmOC services should have: Antibiotics (injections) Oxytocics2 (injectables) Anticonvulsants (injectables) Manual removal of placenta Removal of retained products Assisted Vaginal Delivery The facility providing CEmOC is at the district level serving up to a 500,000 population and which includes: All of the above Caesarean section Blood transfusions Each of the above points needs to be detailed out to the participants. R efer to Handout 1 attached at the end of this unit. Activity 1 Group work (60 min) The purpose of this exercise is to for participants to identify possible essential obstetric care interventions, link with Janani Suraksha Yojana and ASHA worker. 1. Divide the participants into three groups. 2. Provide one group with the case study, second group with the Janani Suraksha Yojana(JSY) Guidelines and the third group with Accedited Social Health Activist (ASHA) document. 3. Group one has to read and discuss the case study and answer the associated questions 4. Group 2 will read the case study and JSY but work only on JSY. In 1 Programming for Safemotherhood, page 69,UNICEF 2 Drug stimulating contractions of the uterus in order to induce labour Manual for MNGOs 26the district context, they should identify the village level persons who can be ASHAs and the possible ways of implementing JSY in their area. 5. Third group will read case study and ASHA document, identify who are possible persons in the village who could fit the 'ASHA criteria'. Keeping her stated roles in mind, what activities can she perform in the un/underserved areas. 6. The facilitator must guide the participants to identify how the ASHA worker and the JSY can become a part of the interventions proposed by the first group on the case study. Case Study Block Bhagipur, District Rampur Population of sample block\u2014250,000 T otal villages -100 Baseline survey revealed the following information: 1. Median age at marriage is 16 years and more that one-third (38%) of women aged 15-19 are already married. 2. Birthrate for this block is 32/1000 live births 3. Institutional deliveries-only 7%, delivery assisted by trained personnel at home and subcentre level is 3%. Remaining 90% are home deliveries. 4. Nearly 70% of women are anaemic 5. Unmet need for spacing method is very low - only 11% and unmet need for limiting is only 9% Other important observations made by the survey team were: T opographically, a portion of the block runs into the thick forests and it is not possible to travel for fear of wild elephants and jungle cats. During rainy seasons, many villages are cut off from the road head due to sudden rise in level of rain-fed rivers. The story of the remaining block is not very heartening. The land is very alkaline and farmers get a moderate to low yield on kharif and rabi crops. Interaction with the women revealed that the pregnant women knew about TT and got the shots from the ANM whenever she came. The red tablets were given but no one consumed these as they only increased the body heat and affected their bowel movements. The nearest health facility was the hospital of the adjoining block or private hospitals in town. Hospitals and doctors were difficult to access and usually dais were called for delivery at home. Only the few rich farmers in the villages took dais were called for delivery at home. Only the few rich farmers in the villages took dais their daughters-in-law to the doctor for the delivery, that too after the dai had told dai had told dai them so. Many women had 4-5 children, there were very few from the group who said that they used any contraceptive spacing method. Identify and prioitise the maternal health needs for the women (refer to Units 2.1, 2.2 and module 1) As FNGO what Essential Obstetric Care interventions will you plan and how will you implement the same? What role would you play as an MNGO to support the FNGOs for implementing the interventions? Module 2 273 Woman bearing child for the first time or first time pregnant 1. Antenatal Coverage and quality of Antenatal care This is important for both mothers and newborn. The RCH-phase 2 aims to raise the proportion of pregnant women receiving three ANC check-up to 80% from the present level of 44% (NFHS-2). Improve equity - driven coverage of ANC Make special efforts to reach the women of BPL, SC/ST and other marginalized groups T arget primigravida3 and adolescent mother Ensure fixed day ANC activity/clinic in the community and in the facilities Involve AWWs , women's groups, TBAs and other community partners to reach out to each pregnant woman, especially the above-mentioned groups. Improve quality of ANC Ensure : First check-up in first trimester T otal three or more check ups T wo doses of TT Ingestion of 100 tablets of IFA Ensure that ANC includes History, General physical Examination, weight recording, BP , exam for oedema and anaemia, urine exam, abdominal palpation for foetal size, foetal position, abdominal girth foetal movements and foetal heart sounds. In addition, blood grouping should be done at the facility level. Improve counselling at ANC sessions focusing on: Promotion of institutional deliveries, discussion of various contraceptive methods. Educate women on danger signs of obstetric emergencies Discuss birth preparedness Educate on early care of the baby 2. Birth planning This includes helping the couple decide about the place of delivery , attendant at work, where to go in case of an emergency, how transport can be arranged and how resources can be arranged. Persons who should be trained in birth planning are TBAs, Link workers, AWWs, ASHA, male workers and NGO community volunteers. This is important especially in unserved ad underserved areas. Handout 2 on birth planning is given at the end of this unit. Essential Obstetric Care Handout 1Manual for MNGOs 28Handout 1 3. Ensuring delivery with a Skilled Birth Attendant (SBA) The term 'Skilled Attendant' as per the UN definition refers exclusively to people with midwifery skills (for example doctors, midwives, nurses) who have been trained to proficiency in the skills necessary to manage normal deliveries and diagnose, manage or refer complications. They must be able to manage- normal labour and delivery recognize the onset of complications, perform essential interventions, start treatment and manage the referral of mother and baby to superior facilities for interventions that are beyond their competence or not possible in a particular setting. It should be noted that TBAs , even after training, do not fulfill the criteria of a skilled birth attendant. The National RCH-II PIP states that efforts will be made to promote deliveries by skilled birth attendants at sub-centres and in the community; in addition introduce a new cadre of Community Skilled Birth Attendants (CSBAs) - An initiative that would be piloted. The GOI has recently approved that in order to save lives of women with obstetric complications in the community , the ANMs will be permitted to Metronidazole They have been permitted to start an IV infusion in an emergency 4. Referral system One important strategy to reduce delays (refer to unit 3.1) is the strengthening of the referral system. T o ensure that it happens, the following points are to be kept in mind: Adequate information and communication between the household to the birth attendant Birth attendant being able to identify the problem and make spot decision to shift person to a basic or comprehensive level facility (identified beforehand) Communicating this decision and getting the consensus of the family members to agree. Mobilize resources for meeting cost of transport Reaching the facility level and communicating to the service providers Effective and readily available transportation system Existence of EmOC facilities close enough to every community to be reached in time Module 2 29Systems should have trained providers, facilities with equipments in working condition for each level 5. Emergency Obstetric Care An important strategy of the RCH-phase 2 National PIP is enhancing availability of facilities for institutional deliveries and Emergency Obstetric Care. This will be achieved through: Operationalization of all CHCs and at least 50% of PHCs for providing 24 hour delivery services including the management of common obstetric complications, emergency care of sick children and referrals Operationalization of Emergency Obstetric and Child Care services at 2000 first Referral Units Ensure access to a blood bank at all district hospitals and a blood storage facility at FRUs Train MBBS medical officers in anaesthetic skills for Em OC Train MBBS medical officers in caeserean section Provide emergency obstetric care services to BPL families at recognized private facilites 6. Postpartum monitoring and care Globally, half of all maternal deaths take place within day one of delivery and 70% of maternal deaths occur within the first week470% of maternal deaths occur within the first week470% of maternal deaths occur within the first week . The National RCH-II PIP document has stated that only 16.5% women received a post-partum check up within two months of delivery (NFHS-II). Of these, less than one third were seen within the first post partum week, a period associated with high complication rate. As a large proportion of births especially among the poor may continue to occur at home and even the institutionally - delivered babies and their mothers are likely to be discharges within a day or so after delivery, the RCH-II is proposing to link home based newborn care and home-based postpartum care of the mother . The community level workers trained under Janani Suraksha Yojana will provide this care. The IMNCI protocols will also provide Postpartum care through field level workers like Anganwadi workers and advice on postpartum care. 4 Manual for MNGOs 30Women and their families need to know How to recognize danger signs Where to go for delivery care and emergency care; and How to arrange in advance for transport, They should also: Understand facts about the biological processes of pregnancy and delivery Know the expected date of delivery Understand the importance of a skilled birth attendant and materials needed for clean delivery (in homes, health centers or hospitals). Realize the need to mobilize resources to pay for services - anticipated (delivery care) and unanticipated (essential obstetric care) expenses. Understand the importance of postnatal care for mother and infant, and where to get it Realize the value of exclusive breastfeeding and sources of help in case of any difficulty Discuss the return to fertility and the availability of family planning services Source : Care during pregnancy and childbirth, prenatal, Page 56,Programming for Safe Motherhood, Oct 1999 Key elements of Birth Preparedness Handout 2Module 2 31Protocol for Postpartum care First postpartum visit should take place within the first 24 hours after delivery Second postpartum visit in the first 7-10 days Counselling New born care (a) During the first post partum visit (within the first 24 hours), the health worker must do the following: Investigate the details, including nature of birth attendant History of bleeding - A more practical question would be to ask the woman about the number of pads or cloth pieces getting soaked with blood. Postpartum haemorrhage is defined as vaginal bleeding in excess of 55 ml after childbirth. If a woman is bleeding heavily, she will soak a pad or cloth in less than 5 minutes - this is immediate PPH. It requires urgent management and referral. History of convulsions or loss of consciousness History of abdominal pain History of fever Newborn - history of birth, when the baby has passed urine and stool/ meconium. Ideally, a newborn should pass urine within 24 hours and meconium within the first 48 hours History of any problem with the newborn such as: Fever Child is not suckling properly Child has difficulty in breathing (b) In the second visit (in the first 7-10 days), the health worker should ask the above questions, as well obtain a history of symptoms related to postpartum depression or history of easy fatigability and \"not feeling well\". The health worker should again check the mother for: continued bleeding (delayed PPH) foul smelling discharge swelling of breasts or engorgement of the breasts pain or problem while passing urine Check the newborn for: cough or cold loose stools fever child not feeding pus discharge from the umbilicus Handout 3Manual for MNGOs 32(c) Counselling Diet and Rest Inform mother on extra intake 550 kcal extra in a day for the first six months, 400 kcal for the next six months. Adequate rest during the post partum period to regain her strength. (d) Newborn care and feeding: Baby to be kept warm and dry Delay bathing the baby Avoid prelacteal feeding Colostrum feeding within the first two hours of birth and continued breast feeding Exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months Demand feeding should be encouraged No bottle feeds (e) Contraception Remind the mother whenever she restarts her menses and or stops exclusive breastfeeding she can conceive even after a single act of unprotected se x. The various choices of contraceptives available should be told to the couple so that they can make an informed choice.

Discuss the status of newborn, infants, low birth weight babies and under- five children, morbidity and mortality in India and specific reference to your state 3. Discuss early and exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding Outcome Participants will have clarity regarding status of newborn and child health Methodology: Presentation followed by discussion Duration 60 min Link with the previous unit The previous units (2.1,2.2) have dealt with the subject of maternal health and interventions. This unit will focus on the status of newborn and children especially in India, correlation between maternal heath and care and survival of the newborn, and causes of perinatal, neonatal mortality and morbidity . Training aids Case study copies, chart paper and marker pens Handout Maternal Complications and Perinatal Outcomes, Reasons for newborn deaths Notes for the Facilitator Have handy data on perinatal, neonatal and infant mortality for India and your state Use recent data from Rapid Household survey wherever available. Introduction/Inputs ( 60min) Steps 1. Discuss status of health of newborns and under-five children, neonatal mortality causes and neonatal mortality rate, stillbirths and perinatal mortality - causes and rate, infant mortality -causes and rate and low birth weight. See details in Handout 1 of this unitUnit 2.3 New born and Child Health Manual for MNGOs 342. Link the status of newborns and under-five children with the three-delay model stated below. Delay in access that contributes to Foetal-neonatal deaths This model discussed in unit 3.1 is also applicable to the survival of under -five children, especially girls. The expectation of survival for a sick newborn especially a LBW baby is often so low that even well educated families may not seek care. Baby girls may be less likely than boys to receive timely and appropriate care. Delays in obtaining care occur at three critical points: Delay 1: Delay in deciding to seek care Delay 2: Delay in reaching the health facility Delay 3: Delay in receiving appropriate quality care at the health facility 3 Activity- 1 Story telling exercise Ask for 4-5 volunteers from the participants group A volunteer to speak for 3 minutes and the story line developed is continued by the next person. The story thus developed should encompass the three-delay model. 4. Health status of under-five children The discussion points should include: Importance of colostrum feeding in newborns Need for counselling all pregnant and lactating mothers to start early and exclusive breast-feeding. Complementary feeding from 6 months age Immunization and vitamin A Common infections affecting children under five: Diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases Status of newborns and under-fives in India Children are the building blocks of a nation. Survival of newborns and infants is directly related to the maternal health, nutrition status and the management of obstetric complications during a woman's delivery and postnatal period. Of the nearly 8 million infant deaths each year, around two-thirds occur during the neonatal period (the first month of life)1. About 3.4 million deaths occur in the first week. For every neonatal death another child is born with a physical disability. In India, every year 27 million infants are born. Around 10% of them do not survive to 5 years of age. In absolute figures, India2 contributes to 25% of the over 10 million under-five deaths occurring worldwide every year. Nearly half of the under-five deaths occur in the neonatal period. 1 Programming for Safe Motherhood, Why Do Babies Die, page 80, 1999. 2 Improving Maternal, Newborn and Child Health in the SouthEast Asia R egion, pg 31Module 2 35Neonatal mortality India is home to the highest number of births and neonatal deaths in the world. The current neonatal mortality rate (NMR) of 44 per 1000 live births accounts for nearly two-thirds of all infant mortality and half of under- ve mortality. The NMR declined rapidly in the 1980s from 69 in 1980 to 53 in 1990, an unprecedented decrease of almost one quarter in a single decade. However the rate has been static and during 1995-2000, it slipped only a meagre 4 points from 48 to 44 per 1000 live births3. India has a wide range of neonatal mortality rate - from as low as 10 per 1000 live births in Kerala to around 60 in Orissa and Madhya Pradesh. Causes of neonatal mortality4 are: Neonatal sepsis Septicemia and pneumonia-52 percent Birth asphyxia-20 percent Prematurity-15 percent The WHO estimates that India has led the world in neonatal tetanus deaths in 1999, with 23 percent of the 215,000 deaths worldwide. It is considered that NNT is localized in small pockets of remote parts of the country. Other contributing factors are: Poor maternal health and nutrition, inadequate care during pregnancy and delivery, lack of postpartum and new born care, poor birth spacing, age at marriage, women's status and gender. Stillbirths and Perinatal mortality On the basis of community-based studies, the stillbirth rate in India is estimated at 30-35 per 1000 births and the perinatal mortality rate at 60-70 per 1000 births. Thus there are approximately 0.8 million stillbirths and 1.7 million perinatal deaths each year, the highest burden for any country. Various community-based studies and hospital based National Neonatal-Perinatal Database network study (year 2000) state that: Perinatal asphysia (32.8 percent), congenital malformations (10.9 percent) and infections(5.7 percent) are the important causes for stillbirths. The contributing causes are no antenatal checkup, untrained birth attendant in abnormal labour, previous stillbirth, abnormal presentation, birth weight of less than 2000 grams, and lack of resuscitation skills on the part of the birth attendants Infant mortality Many infant (0-1 year age) deaths are closely linked to women's nutritional status and overall health. The present infant mortality rate in India has reduced from 105 in 1983 to 64 per 1000 live births (SRS 2002). Infant mortality includes all causes of deaths occurring to babies from birth to one year of age. 3 State of India's Newborns, Save the Children Fund, November 2004 4 Bang etal Lancet (uc) 1999:354:1905-61Manual for MNGOs 36The major causes of infant mortality are: Low birth weight Infections (septecemia, pneumonia, malaria during pregnancy) Diarrhoea Measles Accidental causes Congenital anomalies Cot deaths Low Birth weight For babies to survive, they require proper nourishment from the prenatal period, adequate care, feeding and protection from sources of infections. It is seen that babies with birth weight of less than 2500 grams are at a greater risk dying. These babies are termed as Low Birth Weight(LBW). In India, the mean birth weight of normal newborns is reported to be between 2800 and 3000 grams. A newborn infant can be LBW because of: sub optimal intrauterine growth [commonly known as Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), a condition akin to malnutrition], or short gestation (less than 37 weeks). An IUGR infant is also called a small-for-dates (SFD) neonate. At times a LBW neonate can be both preterm and an SFD. Low birth weight (LBW) babies experience higher mortality and morbidities as compared to normal birth weight infants during the neonatal period. LB W in developing countries is caused predominantly by maternal malnutrition, a pre- pregnancy weight of less than 40-45 kg, insufficient nutrition intak e, low weight gain during pregnancy and lack of ANC during pregnancy. Babies with low birth weight face an increased risk of infection and death during the first few weeks of life and when they do survive beyond this period, they have a greater risk of morbidity and may have poorer neurological development (poor vision, decreased educational attainment and more cerebral palsy , deafness and autism). Morbidity among neonates and infants Rubella virus infection during pregnancy can lead to miscarriage and stillbirth but also to congenital defects, including deafness, cataract, mental retardation and heart disease. There is also increasing evidence that low birth weight is associated with an increased prevalence of diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases and stroke in adult life. Module 2 37Health status of under-fives Nutritional Status Malnutrition among children is rampant. Fifty percent of all childhood deaths are attributed to malnutrition. The proportion of LBW babies remains high at one- third of all births. The promotion of early and exclusive breast-feeding is a well- recognized strategy for child survival. It is estimated that in India 28% of mothers initiate breast-feeding within one hour of delivery and only 39.7% practice exclusive breast-feeding till six months (BPNI, 2003). The tenth plan goal is to achieve 50% exclusive breast-feeding by 2007. WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life. Successful breastfeeding requires: The initiation of breastfeeding soon after birth, Avoidance of pre-lacteals, supplementary water or top milk Complementary feeding must be introduced from six months of age for meeting the nutritional requirements of infants. However, in many infants, this is delayed and even if introduced is often insufficient in nutrients. Only 46% of infants receive solid food at nine months of age (NFHS II) against the T enth plan goal of 75% coverage. The promotion of exclusive breastfeeding and the introduction of appropriate complementary feeding will therefore be a major thrust area in RCH Phase-II, in partnership with the Department of Women and Child Development. Immunization and Vitamin A The expanded programme of Immunization was started in 1978 aimed at protecting the newborns against six vaccine preventable diseases. The coverage rates have still not reached the desired levels with 54.2% children completely immunized for age. Coverage rates for individual vaccine are 71.6% for B CG, 55.1% for 3doses of DPT , of OPV and 50.7% for measles. 17.5% of children do not receive any vaccine (NFHS-2). The measles vaccine coverage had improved from 42% reported in NFHS-1. In 2002, 56% of infants were fully immunized in the country. The variations between states in the \"fully vaccinated coverage\" rates in 2001-2002 shows much lower coverage rates in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Jharkhand, in comparison to the southern states. In addition to collaborating with the Government's Pulse Polio Immunisation programme, UNICEF promotes an integrated routine immunisation strategy for polio eradication, measles control, newborn tetanus elimination and V itamin A supplementation at the state, district and subdistrict levels. Some weeks Handout 2Manual for MNGOs 38 before the national and state immunisation days, UNICEF provides support at the district and sub-district levels in identifying areas where services need to be urgently provided and in ensuring their delivery . UNICEF encourages social mobilisation as a means of reaching the maximum number of people by engaging community-based groups and self-help groups. The power supply needed to store the vaccine is unreliable in some states, so UNICEF supports monitoring and supervision of storage and transport equipment. The use of auto- disposable syringes remains crucial to injection safety; UNICEF works to help raise awareness about this. Control of infectious diseases Diarrhoeal disease and acute respiratory infections account for a significant morbidity and mortality among under-five children in India. It is estimated that there are 1.7 episodes of diarrhoea per child per year in under fives (WHO - 1999). NFHS-II data shows that as many as 19% of children under the age of three suffered from diarrhoea in the preceeding two weeks. Most of the deaths are due to dehydration caused by loss of water and electrolytes in the stools. Persistent diarrhoea contributes to malnutrition and further enhances the risk of morbidity and mortality. Dysentry is an acute form of diarrhoeal disease due to invasive bacteria that leads not only to dehydration, but also to multi-system manifestations and death. The Oral Rehydration Therapy programme was started in 1986-87 with the objective of preventing deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases. Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) can involve the upper (nose, throat) or the lower respiratory tract (bronchi, lungs). The lower respiratory tract infections (broadly termed as pneumonias) are a major cause of death of infants and children in India accounting for about 30% of under-five deaths. Rapid Household survey (2002) showed that utilization of Government facilities for seeking healthcare for children with ARI was very low (14%). NFHS-II data shows that medical care from the public sector for treating children with ARI was 62%. The RCH-II will be using the Integrating Management of Newborn and Childhood Illness approach for dramatically reducing ARI deaths.

Still birth rate (SBR): Number of still births per 1,000 births ( live and still births) during the reference year. Perinatal mortality rate (PMR): Number of deaths of foetuses weighing at least 500 g (or when birth weight is unavailable, after 22 completed weeks of gestation or with a crown-heel length of 25 cm or more) plus the number of early neonatal deaths, per 1,000 total births. Infant mortality rate (IMR): Probability of dying between birth and e xactly one year of age expressed per 1,000 live births.

Methodology Group work on case followed by presentation Duration 90 minutes Link with the previous unit This unit is in continuation to the previous unit 2.3 on newborn and child health. In this unit we shall discuss Essential New born Care, and Integrated Management of Newborn and Childhood Illnesses. Participants will get ample opportunity to work in groups on a case study. The objective of this case study is to enable participants to identify and prioritize health needs of the women and what essential newborn care interventions should be undertake. Facilitator's Notes Must have a clear understanding of the various terms used Keep the presentations ready Allow time for participant's discussion Note down delays as mentioned by participants Note interventions and finally collate the same. Summarize the session Introduction/Inputs 30 min Steps Start the session with the role-play given below. The facilitator can develop a similar kind of role-play. The role-play will enable participants to understand the newborn care issues at field level and the role they can play as MNGOs /FNGOs. After discussing the points raised by the role play, present the basic newborn care based on the handout.Module 2 43 During presentation, ask participants to recall their observations from the field on new born and child care practices. Discuss the newborn and child health interventions under RCH-II . These include the guiding principles, newborn and child health strategy: The IMNCI 'Plus'. Activity - Role play followed by discussion (1 hour) Ask for five volunteers from the participants group. Give them the different roles and explain to them the objective of the role play Story teller or Suthradhar - Introduces the concept and story line for the role play 1) Husband Suresh\u201435-years-old man not having a regular source of income, spends most of his time watching the passer-bys. Otherwise well mannered, consumes liquor once in fifteen days or when he has some extra money. He has two sons and two daughters. His youngest daughter is 2 years old. 2) Radha - 28-years-old wife of Suresh has just delivered a baby 2 days ago, Baby was given prelacteal feeds for the first two days. After discarding the yellow milk she has initiated breast feeding. T oday, her baby is not very active and neither is she feeding properly. Something is certainly wrong. 3) Dhano Dai --As in her previous deliveries, this baby too was delivered by her. Dai --As in her previous deliveries, this baby too was delivered by her . Dai She used a new blade and clean tie to cut and tie the cord. Dhanu learnt it in one of meetings at the PHC when she had gone to collect her money from the ANM. But this time the delivery was a little difficult. Baby had swallowed some fluid and did not cry immediately after birth. Dhanu had to use oil massage, hold the baby upside down, pat her on the buttock and only after five minutes she gave a feeble cry. This baby is also weak and small, thought Dhano. She bathed and wrapped the little one before handing her over to Radha. God bless her, she said - hope she survives. 4) Massi - Neighbour, middle-aged lady, studied up to class five and helps in Massi - Neighbour , middle-aged lady , studied up to class five and helps in Massi cooking mid-day meals in the nearby school. 5) ANM- Kaushalya - is very conscious of her work and is quick regular Dialogues Neighbour \u2014Radha, Radha, you are sleeping and so is your baby! Oh Radha, your baby is running a fever, touch her and see - she is hot. Radha - Are, massi she has been very quiet since morning and not feeding massi she has been very quiet since morning and not feeding massi properly . I think it is that Kamla the childless one, she was outside my door yesterday, surely it is only because of her! Suresh - what has happened, why are you making so much noise, can't you see I am sleeping? What a house- I can't sleep at night because the children are crying and I can't sleep now because you are screaming.Manual for MNGOs 44 Massi - Suresh Massi - Suresh Massi beta, go and call the beta, go and call the beta dai, this baby is running dai, this baby is running dai a fever and only she can do something. Go fast and call her, Suresh goes\u2014(Exit Suresh) Suthradhar: (2 hours pass by and there is no sign of Suresh or the Dai. Massi in the meantime gives Radha a hot drink and tells her to feed the baby. She takes a cloth and keeps it on the forehead of the baby and rubs her feet and palms). Radha feels the forehead and says, Radha feels the forehead and says, massi - massi - massi I think fever is not decreasing. Massi -this Suresh is good for nothing! He must have stopped by to talk to Massi -this Suresh is good for nothing! He must have stopped by to talk to Massi someone and forgotten all about you and the baby. She yells for Radha's eldest son - 'Raju - go to the Centre which is 5 Massi takes Radha and her baby to the Centre which is 5 Massi kms away. It takes the tonga 2 hours to reach the same. Radha is tired and her baby is hot, skin is dry and she is lying limp in her arms. The chowkidhar is there and he makes them sit in the clinic. The ANM has just returned from her immunization visits so she too is there). ANM - ANM - ANM What is the matter? How are you here -What is the matter? How are you here - Massi , is everything alright. Massi , is everything alright. Massi Massi shows her the baby- Beta- please do something. ANM examines the baby, tells Beta- please do something. ANM e xamines the baby , tells Beta them that the baby is very ill with fever and she can only give her first aid. They must go to the higher level centre as the doctor is there and will be able to treat her. Radha starts to cry. Sutradhar: Medicine for the fever is available - and the ANM gives the baby the same. ANM tells the mother to continue breastfeeding. The baby will take the medicine only in small doses but she must not stop feeding, as she needs nourishment. She has to anyway go to the centre so all three leave by the tonga. Between Radha, ANM and Massi they take turns to do Massi they tak e turns to do Massi the wet fomentation. Radha feeds the baby every half hourly. Centre- It takes them 3 hours to reach. Doctor admits the child and tells them that the baby has an infection as she had swallowed fluid, which has got into her lungs. Also baby is very weak. The doctor is happy that the centre ANM was able to bring them and said he would try his best to save the baby. Radha is quiet and very, very tired. Observations Comment on individual roles At what stages did the delay occur? What were the types of delays? What interventions can we carry out as FNGOs to save babies?Module 2 45 New Born Care All newborns need basic care 1) Cleanliness at birth - washing hands with soap and water, using a clean surface, using clean razor blades, ties. In addition babies being with their surface, using clean razor blades, ties. In addition babies being with their mothers in a separate room reduces the chances of cross infection. 2) Warmth - On delivery, new-born babies especially premature and small ones, lose heat rapidly. Simple measures such as a warm room for delivery, immediate drying of the baby and extensive skin-to-skin contact with the mother can prevent loss of body warmth, particularly in resource poor settings. Families need to be told how to warm up babies that become hypothermic and how they should delay bathing the baby. 3) Early and exclusive breast feeding - This should be started within one hour. Feeding should be as frequent as the baby demands it and with no prelacteal feeds or other fluids and food. Breastfeeding also prevents blood loss by stimulating hormone for uterine contractions. 4) Eye care- involves cleaning of the eyes immediately after birth. Early diagnosis and management of eye infections should be done 5) Immunization - BCG at birth, OPV at the time of birth, 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, DPT and Hepatitis- 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, measles- 9-12 months 6) Resuscitation - Birth asphyxia should be recognized promptly and management should follow the basic principles of resuscitation- aspiration of mouth and nostrils, gentle stimulation and if needed ventilation with positive pressure and cardiac massage if heart rate does not increase after effective ventilation. Some newborns need Essential Newborn care This care must be provided as soon as possible, and relies on : Skilled attendance at birth Effective referral Transportation to a higher facility for specialized care. Delays in management of complications can result in infant deaths, handicaps, chronic diseases and disability. Pre term and low birth weight infants need greater attention and more effective recognition and treatment of complications.Handout 1Manual for MNGOs 46Newborn and child health strategy in RCH phase-II (IMNCI Plus) In RCH Phase II, a comprehensive newborn and child health package of interventions will be implemented in the country with the aim of achieving a decisive breakthrough in neo-natal, infant and child mortality. The objectives are: Increase coverage of skilled care at birth for newborns in conjunction with maternal care Implementation by 2010 of a newborn and child health package of prevention promotive and curative interventions using a comprehensive IMNCI approach. This package will be at all facility levels from sub-centres to First Referral Units. It will also be at the household level in rural and periurban settings - through Anganwadi workers, ASHAs/Link V olunteers (LV) Implement the medium-term strategic plan for the Universal Immunization Programme Strengthen and augment existing services in areas where IMNCI is yet to be implemented Skilled care at Birth The RCH-II programme aims at promoting institutional deliveries. Newborn care is relatively easy to implement in facilities because of the presence of skilled birth attendants (doctor/nurse/ANM/LHV), and an enabling/supporting environment. However, as a large number of deliveries would continue to occur at homes by the TBAs for some more years to come, especially in the EA G states, it is considered desirable to continue to impart newborn skills to TBAs in areas with high rates of home deliveries. This should be done in order to enable them to contribute as much as possible towards newborn survival and health improvement in partnership with the community members, families, and the ANMs/AWWs/ASHA and Link Workers. The IMNCI approach will be the centrepiece of newborn and child strategy in RCHPhase-II. The comprehensive model that will be implemented will include the home and community -based component (through ANMs/AWWs/LVs) and the facility-based outpatient care component. In addition, a component on management of sick neonates and children in the inpatient setting at PHCs/CHCs/FRUs and in private facilities will be added. Training for IMNCI Service providers of the health and ICDS at facility and community level will be trained both through the pre-service and the in-service training pack age for upgradation of IMNCI skills. Handout 2Module 2 47Referral funds will be made available and AWW/ANM would be utilized for the transport of sick neonates and children. Community based organizations will be involved to mobilize local solutions and mechanisms to ensure transportation of sick neonates and children. Administering select drugs The GOI is examining the proposal to allow ANMs and Community Skilled Birth Attendants to administer Gentamycin injections to neonates and for A WWs to administer ORS and cotrimoxazole to sick neonates. Community-based interventions Broadly, these include: Mobilization of families for institutional deliveries in government and private facilities Promotion of health home care practices for new born care Promote healthy home practices in diarrhoea Make ORS readily/freely available Widen the net of persons who can treat diarrhoea Promote early recognition of neonates and childhood illness Improve referral of sick neonates and children who cannot be managed at home Other than the above points, there is also a focus on: Infant and young child feeding Vitamin A, Iron and Foilc acid supplementation Implementing the UIP medium term strategic plan that will address the goals of: providing efficient and safe immunization, contribute to global polio eradication, measles mortality reduction and neonatal elimination sufficient and sustainable fund flow sustaining demand and reduce social barriers introducing new and under-utilized vaccines against diseases with significant mortality and morbidity in India Monitoring and use of data on vaccine-preventable diseasesManual for MNGOs 48Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health (ASRH)Unit- 2.5 Objectives T o identify the key Sexual and Reproductive Health issues that affect the life of the adolescents, T o identify various resources that are available at village, block, district level for developing adolescent and youth friendly services Develop linkage between identified resources, strategies and activities Outcome Participants have a clear understanding of ASRH and will be able to initiate adolescent and youth friendly services. Duration 90 minutes Link with previous unit After understanding the key issues in the previous units pertaining to maternal and newborn health and interventions, we shall now shift our focus to the world of adolescents. In this unit, we shall collectively look at the adolescent se xual and reproductive health issues; identify areas for NGOs involvement and contribution towards addressing adolescent health programming. Methodology Brainstorming followed by task analysis and presentations Training aids Written instruction for the group exercise, chart paper, exercise material Handout Data on Adolescents in India: Absolute numbers, India specific data from NFHS-II Notes for the facilitator What do they understand by the term ASRH? What are the key issues in sexual and reproductive health of adolescents? Have enough chart papers, markers, cards available for conducting the resource mapping, strategies, activities for adolescent and youth friendly services in the project area.Module 2 49Introduction Why is it important to work with adolescents? (5 min) About one fifth of India's population is in the adolescent age group and yet to begin their reproductive lives. It is expected that this age group will continue to grow. All children in the age group of 10-19 years are adolescents. Focusing on this age group is critical for ensuring the health of future generations, and to achieve demographic transition and population stabilization in India. Furthermore, adolescents are more flexible to behavioral change, and targeting this group can assist in changing future patterns of health problems and epidemics such as HIV/AIDS. Fostering and more importantly, sustaining an environment for gender equality and the empowerment of women is not possible without examining the attitudes and behaviour of adolescents, especially adolescent boys. Adolescents are important as a target and as potential partners in population development planning and implementation. It has also been recognized that the health needs of adolescents are different and require separate attention. Activity 1 Presentation on Situation analysis of adolescents in India (10 min) Lack of education (low literacy levels among girls, % drop out from schools among boys and girls) SRH is a taboo subject at home, school and in community settings Low awareness and knowledge regarding SRH Misconceptions and misinformation about SRH Lack of skills to deal with peer pressure Under pressure from parents and elders to marry young Undernourished and underweight- fall prey to illness very often Early marriage (before the legal age of marriage both for girls and boys) Early pregnancy and childbirth Unsafe sexual practices Unsafe abortions Repeated abortions Lack of knowledge on family planning usage Exposure to substance abuse and drugs Risk of exposure to RTI/STD and HIV/AIDS Brainstorming on Adolescent Health needs and related interventions (10 min) The period of adolescence is a very exciting part of a person's life. The body undergoes physiological changes due to puberty, resulting in changes in the reproductive system, gaining in height and weight. At the same time, there is also an urge to try experimenting with different activities and take risks. Manual for MNGOs 50 Their curiosity is also aroused and peer pressure and negative influencers easily mislead many adolescents. This is further compounded by the fact that they lack sexual health education. People often label this as 'growing up' and ignore the adolescent. Many adolescents adopt high-risk behaviour due to the numerous myths and there is a near total absence of credible resources to carry out the task either in the school system or in the community as such. Adolescents have poor access to reproductive health information and services and mainly rely on peers - who themselves may be poorly informed - and the media to gain health related information. Thus, it is necessary that all programmes working in the field of RCH address the issue of ASRH in the right earnest. Adolescents are important as a target and as potential partners in population development planning and implementation. It has also been recognized by the GOI, State Governments, NGOs and donors that the health needs of adolescents are different and require separate attention. Exercise -2 (60 min) T o identify resources at Block, District and State level and how to use these in adolescent programming Form 3 groups of the participants and allot them block, district or state. Ask them to discuss and identify the various resources available or that can be mobilized for contributing to ASRH (20 min) Place chart papers on the wall and ask the groups to paste their cards on the same. All participants to move around, read the same and give inputs if necessary (10 min) Participants go back into groups and develop the strategies and activities. Write these on cards. Link the available resource at their level (Block, District, State) to the same (15 min) Stick charts onto different category chart paper and show the links. Facilitator summarizes the entire session: The discussion points by participants on the charts (10 min) Brief presentation on steps for interventions (10 min)Module 2 51Interventions Step 1 Develop interventions for both adolescent boys and girls. Step 2 Categorize them into 10-14 years and 15-19 years. Within each age group make provision for working with school going, non-school going children or school dropouts. Among the older age group of 15-19 years, remember to sub divide again into married and unmarried. Planning interventions for the different categories will thus become simplified. Step 3 Keep in mind the life cycle approach, gender equality and empowerment; the reproductive healthcare package should include a separate healthcare package for adolescents i.e.safe motherhood, family planning, RTI and STD prevention and management, prevention of HIV transmission, and nutritional interventions for vulnerable groups. Step 4 Interact with parents and influencers and seek their consent for the interventions Step5 Ensure that adolescent services are friendly, easily approachable, maintain confidentiality and have counsellors in place. Key interventions mentioned in RCH 2 National PIP are: 1. Orientation of service providers 2. Environment building activities 3.

Duration 90 minutes Link with previous session This is the last unit of the Service Delivery module. The National P opulation Policy encompasses the entire RCH and has laid specific goals for achievement by 2010. Information about maternal, adolescent and child health issues and interventions is incomplete without a discussion on fertility trends in our country , counselling in family planning, informed choice and access to Family Planning services. Methodology Presentation, role play, game and discussions Training aids LCD /OHP , Chart paper, cards, markers, role players. Handout National Population Policy Document; Excerpts from Chapter 5. Family Planning on Unmet, Need for Family Planning, NFHS-II; Notes on counselling and contraceptive methods; Book on The Essentials of Contraceptive T echnology Notes for the facilitator Prepare a power point presentation or have important points written on the chart paperManual for MNGOs 54 All participants to understand the fertility indicators, unmet and met need for family planning. Keep enough samples of modern methods (CuT , Oral Pills, packets of condom) for discussion and demonstration during the session. Make the session interactive and participative through a role-play and game on counselling and modern methods respectively. Introduction/Inputs (90min) Steps Conduct the game on family planning following the rules mentioned below. Mention the correct answers at the end of each round and also provide clarifications if necessary. Conduct a mock counselling session with the help of 2 volunteers. Follow this up with inputs on counselling, informed choice, informed consent and client's rights Discuss unmet and met need and the different indicators used for monitoring family planning activities in the field. Finally discuss how MNGOs/FNGOs through their project interventions will lead to improving contraceptive prevalence rate and enable families to chose spacing or limiting methods Modern Family Planning Methods Game Facilitator to prepare questions and answers on the various family planning methods (see handout given at the end of the unit) Divide the larger group into four teams Each team chooses their leader/ point person who will answer on behalf of the group The group will be given 60 secends to come up with the right answer. Points will be given only if the answer is totally correct If the group gives the wrong answer or only gives a partially correct answer, the question passes to the next group. If this group answers correctly it will score the grace points. Counseling for Family Planning Case on counselling Seek two volunteers from amongst the participants to play the role of client and health worker A woman, 22 years old, with a 9-month-old infant has come to the health worker for information on contraception. Health worker counsels the woman about the methods. Select two volunteers from among the participants - who will be the observers. They will give their comments on the role play.Module 2 55Present the inputs on steps of counselling, clients' rights, informed consent and informed choices (See details given in handout-2 of this unit). Indicators for measuring fertility and family planning usage. The details are given in handout-3. Facilitator to make special mention of: Contraceptive Prevalence Rate. (This is one of the objectives of RCH-2) Method Mix as this can be calculated in smaller populations. Explain the meaning of unmet and met need (RCH 2 and NPP document, steering committee on family welfare for tenth five year plan lays great emphasis on addressing the unmet need for contraception in order to achieve population stabilization). Explain the implications of spacing and limiting on family and household, how this can be linked to improving women's status, household savings and economy, thereby contributing to population stabilization. Suggested activities for MNGOs/FNGOs which can be incorporated in the proposals 1. Identification of eligible couples and awareness activities on family planning methods, link between FP , child survival and maternal health 2. Capacity Building of local women/men/RMPs/TBAs as counsellors/depot holders 3. ASHA workers as counsellors/depot holders of contraceptives 4. Networking with local Health authorities for creating an enabling environment (availability of supplies, trained providers, clean and hygienic environment for cut insertion, sterilization activities) 5. Monitoring of activity with all stakeholders. 6. Follow up or create a mechanism for follow up of pregnant women, especially with a first daughter, to identify and prevent sex selective abortion. Manual for MNGOs 56Game on Family Planning 1. What are clients' rights 5 points Right to information, access, choice, safety, privacy, confidentiality, dignity, comfort, continuity, opinion 2. What is the full form of LAM and what is it? 3 points Lactational Amenorrhoea Method. LAM is a contraceptive method that is based on the natural post-partum infertility that occurs when a woman is amenorrheic and fully breastfeeding. 3. How does LAM work? 3 points Infant's suckling suppresses the production of the hormones that are necessary for ovulation. Without ovulation, pregnancy cannot take place. 4. Who can use LAM? 5 points Women who have all three of the following criteria present: Exclusively or almost exclusively breastfeeding Have not had menses since giving birth Are less than six months post partum 5. What is an IUD? 3 points An IUD is an Intra Uterine Device, small in size and contains copper wire. This is inserted into the woman's uterine cavity to prevent pregnancy 6. How does the IUD work? 3 points Prevents fertilization by: Impairing viability of sperm Interfering with sperm movement 7. Who can have an IUD inserted? 3 points Women of any reproductive age or parity, including young and nulliparous women (woman not having borne any children) Women who have no health conditions that preclude the use of an IUD, such as RTIs. 8.

Advantages of IUD 5 points Highly effective No constant supplies needed Easy to use Does not interfere with intercourse Quick return to fertility 10. What is the full form of COC and what are these? 3 points COC is combined Oral Contraceptive These are pills taken once a day to prevent pregnancy. They contain the hormones estrogen and progestogen 11. How do Combined Oral Contraceptives work? 5 points They inhibit ovulation Thicken cervical mucus (make it hard for sperm to penetrate cervix) Change endometrium - makes implantation less likely 12. Any three advantages of COCs 5 points Safe and 99% effective if used consistently and correctly Reversible Rapid fertility return Easy to discontinue use Non-invasive and unrelated to sexual activity Has non-contraceptive benefits as well (e.g. Menstrual cycle benefits - decreases menstrual blood loss and the duration; decrease menstrual cramps and pre-menstrual tension as cycles are anovulatory; protection from ovarian and endometrial cancer) 13. What is emergency contraception? 3 points This is the use of certain methods (combined pills or Progestin-only pill) after unprotected intercourse to prevent pregnancy 14. What is the timing of the EC pills ? How do they work? 5 points Within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse ECs do not interrupt an established pregnancy. Depending on when taken during the menstrual cycle, EC pills may inhibit or delay ovulation, have effects after ovulationManual for MNGOs 5815. When should ECs be used? 5 points No contraception is used A contraceptive method fails A contraceptive method is used incorrectly Coercive sex or rape takes place 16. Male Sterilization, medical term, and how does it work? 3 points A surgical procedure that permanently ends fertility in men, Vasectomy, It interrupts the vas deferens, preventing the sperm from entering the semen so that semen is ejaculated without sperm 17. Female sterilization, how does it work? 3 points It is a surgical procedure where the fallopian tubes that carry the egg from the ovary to the uterus are blocked (tied, cut or interrupted by ring or clip). Sterilization ends fertility permanently. (Only2% failure in 10 years) Blocking the fallopian tubes prevents the sperm from uniting with an egg, thereby preventing fertilization. 18.

F Insertion of a copper-T in an HIV-infected woman or one who is at high risk of infection is not usually recommended TModule 2 59 Counselling Counselling is the process of helping clients confirm or make informed and voluntary decisions about their individual care. It is a two-way exchange of information that involves listening to clients and informing them of their options. Counselling is always responsive to each client's individual needs and values. All providers, regardless of their professional background and educational credentials, need special training in counselling and in how to mak e an informed choice. The steps for Counselling are G-Greet A-Ask T-T ell H-Hear E-Explain R-Return Visit Informed Choice, Informed Consent and Client's Rights Informed choice is a voluntary, well-considered decision that an individual Informed choice is a voluntary , well-considered decision that an individual makes on the basis of options, information, and understanding. The decision making process should result in a free and informed decision by the individual about whether or not he or she desires to obtain health services and, if so, what method or procedure he or she will choose and consent to receive. Informed consent is the communication between client and provider that confirms that the client has made an informed and voluntary choice to use or receive a medical method or procedure. Informed consent can only be obtained after the client has been given information about the nature of the medical procedure, its associated risks and benefits, and other alternatives. R egardless of the presence or absence of written documentation, informed consent requires providers to ensure that a client receiving a method or treatment has knowingly and voluntarily agreed to be treated. Whether informed consent is written or verbal, it cannot replace the informed choice process, which is dependent on counselling and the information exchange between providers and clients. Clients have the right to: Information Access to services Informed choice Safe services Privacy and confidentiality Dignity, comfort, and expression of opinion Handout 2Manual for MNGOs 60Indicators for measuring Fertility and Family Planning usage Goals and Strategies are linked with measurable indicators for monitoring programme implementation. The NFHS-II provides detailed information on fertility levels, differentials and trends using both summary and age-specific measures of fertility. These indicators are: 1. Crude Birth Rate (CBR) - Annual number of births per 1000 population 2. General Fertility Rate (GFR)- Births to women age between 13-49 years divided by women-years lived between age 15and 49 years multiplied by 1000 women. Both these indicators are crude summary measures of the rate at which the population is replacing itself. A more precise picture of fertility can be obtained by examining the age-specific fertility rates (ASFRs) and the total fertility rate (TFR), because they are not affected by the age structure of the population. Both are based on the number of births during the period of survey. 3. ASFR - number of live births in a five-year age group divided by number of women-years lived in the same five-year age interval during the survey period. 4. The T otal Fertility Rate (TFR) is a summary measure that is calculated as five times the sum (in the over five-year age group) of the age-specific fertility rates. The age specific fertility rate is further analyzed using the following differentials: Urban, rural, education, religion, caste, tribe, maternal age at birth, duration of effective marriage, outcome of pregnancy- in terms of spontaneous abortions, induced abortions, still births, live births. Also included are fertility differentials by children ever born and living, sex ratio at birth, birth order, birth intervals, age at first and last birth, childbearing at young ages, post-partum amenorhoea, abstinence, non-susceptibility and finally menopause. Information on contraceptive usage is gathered on knowledge and practice obtained through interaction with eligible couples. The performance of the family planning programme in a State or district can be known by the unmet and meet need for family planning. Handout 3Module 2 61Excerpts from Chapter 5, Family Planning of NFHS - II on Unmet, Met Need for Family Planning in India Need for Family Planning Currently married women who are not using any method of contraception but who do not want any more children or want to wait two or more years before having another child are defined as having an unmet need for family planning . Current contraceptive users are said to have a met need for family planning. The total demand for family planning is the sum of the met need and the unmet need. According to these definitions, 16 percent of currently married women in India have an unmet need for family planning. The unmet need for spacing births is the same as the unmet need for limiting births (8 percent). If all of the women who say they want to space or limit their births were to use family planning, the contraceptive prevalence rate would increase from 48 percent to 64 percent of currently married women, implying that 25 percent of the total family planning need is not being met. Comparison with NFHS-1 indicates that the proportion of women with an unmet need for family planning declined from 20 to 16 percent during the six and a-half years between the two surveys. The proportion of total demand for family planning that is met increased from 68 percent to 75 percent. Unmet need is highest (27 percent) among women below age 20; the unmet need in this age group is almost entirely for spacing rather than for limiting. Unmet need is also relatively high for women age 20-24 (24 percent), with 75 percent of the need being for spacing. Among women age between 25-29, 19 percent have an unmet need, and more than half of this need is for limiting. Only 23 percent of the total demand for family planning is being met for married women age 15-19. This proportion rises sharply to 52 percent for women aged from 20-24, to 73 percent for women aged from 25-29, and to 82-95 percent for women aged from 30-49. Both met need and unmet need for contraception among women aged 30 years and above are mostly for limiting. Unmet need for family planning is higher in rural areas than in urban areas, and the proportion of total demand for family planning that is satisfied is lower in rural areas than in urban areas. Unmet need for family planning varies by women's education, but only within a narrow range of 14 to 17 percent. The percentage of demand satisfied rises with education from 73 percent among illiterate women to 79 percent among women with at least a high school education. Manual for MNGOs 62Hindu and Christian women have a lower unmet need for family planning (15 percent) than Muslim women (22 percent), but a higher unmet need than women from other religious groups (8-13 percent). The percentage of total demand satisfied is higher for Hindu and Christian women (77-78 percent) than for Muslims (63 percent), but less than that of other religious groups (80-88 percent). There are no notable differentials in the extent of unmet need by caste/ tribe, but the percentage of demand satisfied is somewhat higher for women who do not belong to a scheduled caste or tribe or other backward class. Unmet need declines steadily from 18 to 13 percent, and the percentage of demand satisfied increases from 69 to 83 percent as the standard of living inde x rises from low to high. Unmet need is much higher for women with one living child and for women with six or more living children (23 percent) than for women with either no children (14 percent) or two to five children (12-17 percent). Among women with no children or one child, unmet need is almost exclusively for spacing. The proportion of unmet need that is for limiting then rises from 47 percent among women with two living children to 91 percent among women with six or more living children. Among women with no living children, only 24 percent of the total demand for family planning is satisfied. Half of the total demand is satisfied among women with one living child. The proportion of demand satisfied rises sharply to 80-85 percent for women with two to four living children and then declines to 65 percent for women with six or more children. These results indicate that the family planning programme's strong emphasis on sterilization results in failure to meet the spacing needs of young women who are still in the process of forming their families. Interstate Variations in Unmet Need T able 5.24 and Figure 5.5 show that unmet need for family planning services ranges from 7 percent in Punjab to 25 percent in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (among major states) to 36 percent in the small northeastern state of Meghalaya. In Uttar Pradesh unmet need declined from 30 to 25 percent between NFHS-1 and NFHS-2. In Bihar it remained unchanged at 25 percent. In Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Orissa, unmet need declined from 20-22 West Bengal, Assam and Gujarat are the other states that have achieved a considerable decline in unmet need since NFHS-1. Unmet need increased in all the northeastern states except Assam. The percentage of demand satisfied increased in all states except Meghalaya, Mizoram, Goa, and Kerala. The percentage of unmet need that is for spacing ranges from 37 percent in Jammu and Kashmir to 75 percent in Mizoram.Module 2 63In summary, NFHS-2 results show that although current use of contraception has increased and the extent of unmet need has declined in most of the states in India, there is a need for considerable improvement in the coverage and quality of family planning services, especially in the four large states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, as well as in Orissa. The findings underscore the need for appropriate state-specific strategies with emphasis on universal education, imaginative use of electronic mass media for IEC programmes, intensified promotion of temporary methods and improvement in the quality of services.Manual for MNGOs 64Contextual Framework of Family Planning 1 Document on National Population Policy 2000The National Family Welfare Programme in India has traditionally sought 'to promote responsible and planned parenthood through voluntary and free choice of family planning methods best suited to individual acceptors' (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, 1998a). In April 1996, the programme was renamed the Reproductive and Child Health Programme and given a new orientation to meet the health needs of women and children more completely. The programme now aims to cover all aspects of women's reproductive health throughout their lives. With regard to family planning, the new approach emphasizes the target- free promotion of contraceptive use among eligible couples, the provision to couples of a choice of contraceptive methods (including condoms, oral pills, IUDs, and male and female sterilization), and the assurance of high-quality care. An important component of the programme is the encouragement of adequate spacing of births, with at least three years between births (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, n.d.). The National Population Policy, 2000 (NPP 2000)1 adopted by the Government of India affirms the commitment of the government towards voluntary and informed choice and consent of citizens while availing of reproductive health care services and continuation of the target free approach in administering family planning services. The NPP provides a policy framework for advancing goals and prioritizing strategies during the next decade, to meet the reproductive and child health needs of the people of India, and to achieve net replacement levels (TFR) by 2010. It is based upon the need to simultaneously address issues of child survival, maternal health and contraception, while increasing outreach and coverage of a comprehensive package fo RCH services by Government, industry and the voluntary non-Government sector, working in partnership. Of the 14 goals mentioned in the NPP document, three specific goals focus on family planning. These are: 1. Address the unmet needs for basic reproductive and child health services, supplies and infrastructure 2. Achieve universal access to information/counselling and services for fertility regulation and contraception with a wide basket of choices 3. Promote vigorously the small family norm to achieve replacement levels of T otal Fertility Rate.Handout 4Module 2 65In addition, the NPP document also states twelve strategic themes, identified to address these goals: Decentralised Planning and Programme Implementation Convergence of Service Delivery at village level Empowering women for improved Health and Nutrition Child Health and Survival Meeting the unmet needs for Family Welfare Services Underserved Population Groups Diverse Health Care Providers Collaboration with and commitments from Non-Government Organization and the Private Sector Mainstreaming Indian System of Medicine and Homoeopathy Contraceptive T echnology and Research on RCH Providing for the older population Information, Education and Communication Establishing a National Commission on PopulationManual for MNGOs 66Janani Suraksha Yojana Operational Guidelines for Implementation Ministry of Health & Family Welfare Government of India New DelhiAnnexure 1 Manual Yojana (JSY) under over all umbrella of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) is being proposed by way of modifying the e xisting National Maternity Benefit Scheme (NMBS). While NMBS is linked to provision of better diet for pregnant women from BPL families, JSY integrates the cash assistance with antenatal care during her pregnancy period, institutional care during delivery and immediate post-partum period in a health center by establishing a system of coordinated care by field level health work er. The JSY would be a 100% centrally sponsored scheme. 2. Vision I. T o reduce over all maternal mortality ratio and infant mortality rate, and II. T o increase institutional deliveries in BPL families. 3. Target Group All pregnant women - a) Belonging to the below poverty line (BPL) households and b) Have attained the age of 19 years or above c) Up to the two live births. Note 1: The benefits would be extended to all women from BPL families of 10 low performing states namely EAG states and the states of Assam and J&K even after the third live birth if the mother, of her own accord chooses to undergo sterilization in the health facility where she delivered, immediately after the delivery of the second live child. The medical officer of the health center would ensure the number of living children to the beneficiary. This would be essential for disbursement of benefit. Note 2: The benefits would also be available to such pregnant women falling in the above category even though not registered under JSY previously during pregnancy period but needing institutional care for delivery including management of complications like obstructed labour, PPH, eclampsia, PP sepsis etc. Note 3: State will devise necessary mechanisms for adequate certification from the Medical officer of the health institution from where woman has tak en treatment. This would be essential for disbursement of benefit. 4. Strategy 4.1 The main strategy to achieve the envisaged vision as at para 2 above is to link the cash assistance under JSY to institutional delivery . This would, however, entail carrying out following - a) Early registration of the beneficiaries with the help of the village level health workers like ASHA or its equivalent; b) Early identification of complicated cases ; Handout 4Module 2 69 c) Providing atleast three antenatal care , and post delivery visits; post delivery visits; post delivery d) Organizing appropriate referral and provide referral transport to the pregnant mother; e) Convergence with Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) worker by way of involving Anganwadi worker (AWW) intensively; f) Devising as well as ensuring transparent and timely disbursement of the cash assistance to the mother and the incentive to the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) or its equivalent worker with fund available with ANM. 4.2 In addition, to undertake following essential steps: a) T o operationalize 24/7 delivery services at PHC level to provide basic obstetric care, b) Operationalisation of First Referral Units (FRUs) to meet the emergency obstetric care demand, c) Building partnership with doctors, hospitals/nursing homes/clinics from the private sector to provide obst. Services to the JSY beneficiaries by recognizing or accrediting, especially in the rural areas by the district the authority. Note 1: Decentralization of the implementation mechanism is the key to making available the benefits to the poor expectant mothers. Therefore, wherever possible the Gram Panchayat/local elected bodies should be appropriately involved. 5. Features (a) States/UTs have been classified into two categories based on the institutional delivery rate. The 10 states namely the eight EAG states and the states of Assam and Jammu & Kashmir would constitute as Low Performing State (LPS) and the rest as High Performing State (HPS) . (b) Cash assistance linked to Institutional Delivery: It is proposed that the benefits under the scheme would be linked to availing antenatal check ups by the pregnant women and getting the delivery conducted in health centers/ hospitals. While, the beneficiaries will be encouraged to register themselves with the health workers at the sub center/Anganwadi/Primary health centers for availing of atleast three antenatal check-ups, post-natal care and neo - natal care, the disbursement of enhanced benefits under the scheme will be linked to institutional delivery. (c) Cash Assistance in the graded scale. One of the accepted strategies for reducing maternal mortality is to promote deliveries at health institutions, conducted by the skilled personnel like doctors and nurses. Accordingly, it is proposed to provide cash assistance to women from Below Poverty Line families, for enabling them to deliver in health institutions . The assistance will be available as per the following rates.Manual for MNGOs 70(In Rs.) Category of StatesRural Urban Assistance Package to motherPackage for the Accredited WorkerT otal Assistance Package to MotherAccredited Worker/Dai PackageT otal LPS 700 600 1300 600 200 800 HPS 700 NIL 700 NB:LPS: Low Performing States & HPS: High Performing States Note 1 : The package for the expectant mother consists of financial support for the component for medicine and pharmaceuticals items required by the pregnant women in the health institution when she is admitted for delivery Note 2: The package for ASHA or its equivalent provided in the scheme includes: The referral transport assistance for herself and the expectant women to go to the nearest health center, The per diem of the ASHA or its equivalent if she stays with the pregnant women in the health center for delivery, (d) Incentive to the ASHA or its equivalent: Since CSSM programme, a large number of traditional birth attendants (Dai) have been trained. Its time to link them to a regimented system of delivery care services. ASHA or its equivalent should be working as a basic health provider in the village. Such work ers functioning in the rural and urban areas would gets an incentive in all the low performing states for providing certain essential support services. Please see the details at pare 10. Note 1: It must however be ensured that the cash incentive to the ASHA should not be less than Rs.200/- per delivery case facilitated by her. This is essential to keep her sustained in the system. Note 2 : The Assistance package to the accredited worker is available only if the woker properly functions and assists the pregnant women. If any pregnant women doers not take assistance of any accredited worker as no ASHA is in position, she should be paid the sum total of both the packages. (e ) Assistance for Caesarean Section : FRUs/CHCs would provide emergency obst. services. Where Government specialists are not available in a health institution, assistance up to Rs. 1500/- per case will be provided for hiring services of private experts to carry out the surgery either in a Government medical facility or in Private hospital, nursing home, etc. Note: The PHC medical officer would prepare a panel of experts agreeing to deliver services to the JSY beneficiary.Module 2 71(f) Compensation payment for Tubectomy / Laparoscopy: If hospitalization for delivery is followed immediately by T ubectomy/laparoscopy, compensation money available under the Family welfare scheme would also be paid to JSY beneficiary in the health center as per the existing procedure followed for payment of compensation money. (g) Disbursement of cash assistance: As the scheme is targeting the poor women who would generally be short of cash, it is essential that the cash assistance provided under the scheme is made available to her in shortest possible time. With a view to quicken the process of disbursement, the disbursing authority would arrange to provide an imprest money of Rs. 5000/-to every Auxiliary Nurse Midwife /health worker and authorize her to make payment subject to the conditions that the beneficiary concerned fulfils all eligibility conditions and the ANM has completed the laid down procedure. The ANM should keep cash advance of at least Rs.1500/- at any point of time with the ASHA through AWW for use for institutional delivery of beneficiaries already registered under JSY and replenishment thereafter . Note 1: Where Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) exist and an elected body is in place, the State Governments/District society will be at liberty to k eep the money with Panchayati Raj Institutions and empower Auxiliary Nurse Midwifes to incur expenditure jointly with the Gram Panchayat through a simple procedure to recoup the imprest periodically . All disbursements should be made immediately after delivery, if possible, in the hospital itself. (h) Partnership with Private Sector: Acknowledging that much needs to be done to strengthen infrastructural facilities in the public sector , States/Union T erritories would devise mechanism to recognize hospitals/nursing homes/ clinics from Private Sector for providing obstetric care services to the JSY beneficiaries. Thus, benefits proposed under Janani Suraksha Yojana would also be available to such beneficiaries delivering in the accredited health institutions. Note 1 : The State/District authorities would draw up a list of such private institutions and issue necessary Government order at the quickest possible time. Necessary steps should be taken to give wider publicity to such list. Every PHC/ CHC/District Hospital and the sub-center would display names of such private health institutions at a prominent place. State would also draw up a protocol of services to be delivered at these recognized health centers. Note 2: For each Block, the District Health Society/RCH Society should empanel preferably two accessible private health institutions that can handle institutional delivery. This would increase the choice to the expectant BPL mothers to exercise her option (with help of ASHA) for an institution to handle the delivery.Manual for MNGOs 72Note 2: The implementation plan for Public-Private partnership worked out for JSY would be shared with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. (i) Provision to meet administrative expenses: 7% (4 % for the district authorities and 1 % for the state and 2% for the Nodal Ministry at the GOI level) of the fund released to the state may be utilized towards administrative expenses for monitoring, IEC and office expenses for implementation of JSY. 6. Registration Each village would have one ASHA or its equivalent worker registered with the sub-center and the PHC of that concerned village , who would be working under the supervision of the ANM and in tandem with the AWW . Under JSY, her main role would be: a) T o organize delivery care services for the registered expectant mother, b) T o assist in immunization of the new born and c) Propagator/motivator of family planning services. Note: Also please see paragraph 10 . She would be entitled to performance- based incentive. 7. Payment of Cash 7.1 To the expectant mother a) All payments to be made in one installment including compensation amount for sterilization wherever applicable at the time of discharge from the hospital/health center. It would be the responsibility ANM/ASHA to disburse in time. 7.2 To ASHA or its equivalent worker a) In two installments In the rural areas of LPS, out of the assistance package for the accredited worker, amount required for meeting transport cost, per diem of the accredited worker should be paid to arrange for the logistics, The balance amount is to be treated as cash incentive to the accredited worker. 50 % of this would be given as First installment after discharge of the JSY beneficiary from the health center provided ASHA or its equivalent having accompanied, stayed with the pregnant woman in the health center for delivery; and The remaining 50 % of the cash incentive would be given one month after delivery when BCG vaccine has been administered to the child and she has helped in post-natal care and registration of birth of the newborn. Module 2 73Note: The state Government has to draw a detailed plan of implementing the payment details in a manner that there is transparency and that there are no unnecessary delays. 7.3 Cause of delay : T he concerned Medical officer of the PHC and ANM need to record cause of delay against the name of each JSY beneficiary in the concerned register. Monthly meetings taken by CMO should discuss the cause of delay in payment/disbursement. Any unreasonable delay should be dealt with seriously . 7.4 Display of names of JSY beneficiaries: The list of beneficiaries of JSY along with the date of disbursement should mandatorily be displayed on the display board of the sub-center, PHC and the local panchayat/local body office, being updated regularly on month-to-month basis. Wherever necessary, display boards may be procured out of the administrative expenses fund. 7.5 While ANM will be responsible for keeping the monthly accounts of the imprest held by her, PHC medical officer will be over all in-charge. 8. BPL Certification a) Wherever BPL Cards have been issued under the targeted Public Distribution System and Antyodaya Anna Yojana, it should be the instrument of identification of the beneficiaries. b) If BPL cards have not yet been issued, the State/UT governments /Municipalities will lay down a simple criteria for certification of BPL Status, through Panchayats or other mechanisms. c) The Registered ASHA or its equivalent health worker would facilitate in obtaining necessary certification, well ahead of time , so that the non- availability of card or inability to identify a BPL status does not become a hindrance for non-implementation of the scheme. Note1 : Normally families living in urban slums, families working as rag pick ers, pavement dwellers, vendors in village haat /bazaar etc would be eligible. Note 2 : The panchayat and the local bodies should be effectively involved in the certification process in a manner that genuine poor women are able to benefit from this scheme. 9. Drawing a Micro-birth Plan for Each Beneficiary 9.1 The following set of simple actions including a time-line for each of the activities leading to sanctioning of benefits and postnatal care for each expectant mother is the key to efficient implementation of the Scheme. The Registered ASHA or its equivalent worker would be responsible for drawing a micro-plan and organizing obstetric care to the registered JSY beneficiary .Manual for MNGOs 74S No. Activity To be undertaken byProposed Time Line (a) Identification of beneficiary and filling up of the JSY Card. (See ANNEXURE)ASHA or its equivalent worker (Those registered with SC/PHC)Atleast 16-20 weeks before the expected date of delivery. (b) Registering the expectant mother for ANC in the sub-center/health center. Filling of Maternal and Child card (which will be part of the JSY Card). Same as above Registered accredited worker should be present during registration T o start immediately on identification ( c ) Preparing the birth plan including dates of ANCs and recording it on the JSY card and inform the motherANM in the presence of ASHA possibly in consultation with husband or other family members.At least 8-10 weeks before the expected date of delivery. (e) Completion of formalities for receiving JSY benefit Including collecting necessary BPL certificates wherever necessary from Panchayat / local bodies / Municipalities Registered ASHA or its equivalent workerWithin 2-3 weeks from identification (f) Motivating for institutional delivery by explaining enhanced JSY benefits ASHA or its equivalent worker in consultation with MO, PHC Within 2-3 weeks of identification (e) Identify the health center for all referral as well as the place of delivery and inform the pregnant women / her husband / family member and the Registered ASHA. (f) Submit the completed JSY card in the Health center for verification by the authorized/ Medical officer. T aking necessary steps toward delivery as well as to make available fund to ANM/Health worker/ASHA etc.MO, PHC Before 2 weeks of expected date of deliveryModule 2 759.2 For complicated cases or those requiring cesarean section etc , the ANM in consultation with the ASHA or its equivalent worke and the Medical Officer of the PHC would take following steps: i. Pre-determine the Referral health center and intimate the pregnant women about the health center she has to reach when complication arises, ii. ASHA to take the expectant woman to the referral unit along with a letter of referral from MO PHC and register / acquaint the center's staff with the expectant woman , iii. ASHA and the ANM to keep a record of the case in the dairy iv. The transport facility should be pre-organized by the ASHA or its equivalent worker. v. MO, PHC will arrange for the medical experts if the same is not available in the referred heath center, vi. If necessary, pregnant women may be shifted to the health center in advance along with the ASHA or its equivalent worker. Most Important: Referral Health Centers should accept AND honour referral slips from ASHA or its equivalent worker and preference is given to women carrying such REFERRAL SLIPS. 10. Role of Registered Accredited Worker/ASHA ASHA or its equivalent worker under supervision of ANM/AWW would have the following role: Identify pregnant woman from BPL families as a beneficiary of the scheme, Report to the ANM and bring the women to the sub-center/PHC for registration, Assist the woman to obtain BPL certification if BPL card is not available, Provide and / or help the women to receive at least three ANC, Counsel for institutional delivery and fix before 7th month of pregnancy the place of delivery, in close consultation with the ANM and the PHC and inform the beneficiary, Assist in receiving two TT injection, When the pregnant women is in labour or faces complication, escort the women to the pre-determined health center and stay with her till the delivery is complete and women is discharged, Arrange to immunize the newborn till the age of 10 weeks, Register birth or death of the child or mother, Post natal visits within 7 days of pregnancy and track mother's health, Counsel for initiation of breastfeeding within one-hour of delivery and its continuance till 3-6 months, 11. Implementation Department of Family Welfare, Government of India will be the implementing agency at the national level.Manual for MNGOs 7611.1 At the state level, SCOVA or the State Level Committee (SLC) (till such time SCOVA as envisaged under NRHM is instituted) headed by the Principal Secretary in charge of Family Welfare in the state Government will be the implementing agency at the state level. State's Director (F amily Welfare) or DG (Family Welfare), as the case may be, would be the Convener of the committee. The committee will nominate a Nodal Officer for JSY and communicate the same to GOI at the earliest. The State Authority should meet at least once in six months. 11.2 Composition: The SLC would consist of (a) the concerned Secretaries/ Head of such Departments as Finance, Health, Municipal Affairs, Panchayat, Rural Development, Women & Child Development, ICDS (b) a nominee of the Union Family Welfare Department and (c) independent experts and representatives of a few NGOs. Composition of the SLC is to be notified through a GO and a copy would be endorsed to GOI. 11.3 Its roles are: i. Preparation of the Annual Plan of the State and forwarding it to the Government of India which inter-alia entail projecting total requirement of fund based on the estimated the number of beneficiaries for that financial year, ii.

Background The Government of India has decided to launch a National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) to address the health needs of rural population, especially the vulnerable sections of society. The Sub-centre is the most peripheral level of contact with the community under the public health infrastructure. This caters to a population norm of 5000, but is effectively serving much larger population at the Sub-centre level, especially in EAG States. With only about 50% MPW (M) being available in these States, the ANM is heavily overworked, which impacts outreach services in rural areas. Currently Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) are engaged in organizing supplementary nutrition programmes and other supportive activities. The very nature of her job responsibilities (with emphasis on supplementary feeding and pre school education) does not allow her to take up the responsibility of a change agent on health in a village. Thus a new band of community based functionaries, named as Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) is proposed to fill this void. ASHA will be the first port of call for any health related demands of deprived sections of the population, especially women and children, who find it difficult to access health services. In following paragraphs, the role, responsibilities, profile, selection procedure, training modality and compensation package for ASHA has been explained. It has been envisaged that states will have flexibility to adapt these guidelines keeping their local situations in view. 2. Roles & Responsibilities ASHA will be a health activist in the community who will create awareness on health and its social determinants and mobilize the community towards local health planning and increased utilization and accountability of the e xisting health services. She would be a promoter of good health practices. She will also provide a minimum package of curative care as appropriate and feasible for that level and make timely referrals. Her roles and responsibilities would be as follows: ASHA will take steps to create awareness and provide information to the community on determinants of health such as nutrition, basic sanitation & hygienic practices, healthy living and working conditions, information on existing health services and the need for timely utilization of health & family welfare services.Manual for MNGOs 94She will counsel women on birth preparedness, importance of safe delivery, breast-feeding and complementary feeding, immunization, contraception and prevention of common infections including Reproductive Tract Infection/ Sexually Transmitted Infection (RTIs/STIs) and care of the young child. ASHA will mobilize the community and facilitate them in accessing health and health-related services available at the village/sub-centre/primary health centres, such as Immunization, Ante-Natal Check-up (ANC), Post-Natal Check-up (PNC), ICDS, sanitation and other services being provided by the government. She will work with the Village Health & Sanitation Committee of the Gram Panchayat to develop a comprehensive village health plan. She will arrange escort/accompany pregnant women & children requiring escort/accompany pregnant women & children requiring escort/accompany treatment/ admission to the nearest pre-identified health facility i.e. Primary Health Centre/ Community Health Centre/ First Referral Unit (PHC/CHC /FRU). ASHA will provide primary medical care for minor ailments such as diarrhoea, fevers, and first aid for minor injuries. She will be a provider of Directly Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS) under Revised National T uberculosis Control Programme. She will also act as a depot holder for essential provisions being made available to every habitation like Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORS), Iron Folic Acid T ablet (IFA), chloroquine, Disposable Delivery Kits (DDK), Oral Pills & Condoms, etc. A Drug Kit will be provided to each ASHA. Contents of the kit will be based on the recommendations of the expert/technical advisory group set up by the Government of India. Her role as a provider can be enhanced subsequently. States can explore the possibility of graded training to her for providing newborn care and management of a range of common ailments particularly childhood illnesses. She will inform about the births and deaths in her village and any unusual health problems/disease outbreaks in the community to the Sub-Centres/ Primary Health Centre. She will promote construction of household toilets under T otal Sanitation Campaign. Fulfillment of all these roles by ASHA is envisaged through continuous training and upgradation of her skills, spread over two years or more. 3. Selection of ASHA The general norm will be 'One ASHA per 1000 population'. In tribal, hilly, desert areas the norm could be relaxed to one ASHA per habitation, dependant on workload etc. The States will also need to work out the district and block-wise coverage/ phasing for selection of ASHAs. It is envisaged that the selection and training process of ASHA will be given due attention by the concerned State to ensure that at least 40 percent of the envisaged ASHAs in the State are selected and given induction training in Module 2 95the first year as per the norms given in the guidelines. Rest of the ASHAs can subsequently be selected and trained during second and third year . ASHA must be primarily a woman resident of the village - 'Married/ Widow/Divorced' and preferably in the age group of 25 to 45 yrs. ASHA should have effective communication skills, leadership qualities and be able to reach out to the community. She should be a literate woman with formal education up to Eighth Class. This may be relaxed only if no suitable person with this qualification is available. Adequate representation from disadvantaged population groups should be ensured to serve such groups better. Selection Process The selection of ASHAs would have to be done carefully. The District Health Society envisaged under NRHM would oversee the process. The Society would designate a District Nodal Officer, preferably a senior health person, who is able to ensure that the Health Department is fully involved. S/he would also act as a link with the NGOs and with other departments. The Society would designate Block Nodal Officers, preferably Block Medical Officers, to facilitate the selection process, organizing training for Trainers and ASHA as per the guidelines of the scheme. 1. The Block Nodal Officer would identify 10 or more Facilitators in each Block so that one facilitator covers about 10 villages. The facilitators should preferably be women from local NGOs; Community based groups, Mahila Samakhyas, Anganwadis or Civil Society Institutions. In case none of these is available in the area, the officers of other Departments at the block or village level/local school teachers may be taken as facilitators. 2. These facilitators should be oriented about the scheme in a 2-day workshop which should be held at the district level under supervision of the District Nodal Officer. During this meeting, the Block Nodal Officers should also be present. The District Nodal Officer will brief the facilitators and Block Nodal Officers on the selection criteria and importance of proper selection in effective achievement of the objectives of the same and also the role of facilitators and Block Nodal Officers are required to play in ensuring the quality of the selection process. 3. The facilitators would be required to interact with community by conducting Focused Group Discussions (FGDs)/workshops of the local self help groups etc. This should lead to awareness of roles and responsibilities of ASHA and acceptance of ASHA as a concept in the community. This interaction should result in short listing of at least three names from each village. 4. Subsequently a meeting of the Gram Sabha would be convened to select one out of the three shortlisted names. The minutes of the approval process in Gram Sabha shall be recorded. The Village Health Committee would enter into an agreement with the ASHA as in the case of the V illage Education Committee and Sahayogini in Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan. The Gram Panchayat will forward the name to the District Nodal Officer for record.Manual for MNGOs 96State Governments may modify these guidelines except that no change may be done in the basic criteria of ASHA being a woman volunteer with minimum education up to VIII class and that she would be a resident of the village . In case any of the selection criteria or guidelines is modified, these should be widely disseminated in local languages. 4. Institutional Arrangements The success of the ASHA scheme will depend on how well the scheme is implemented and monitored. It will also depend crucially on the motivational level of various functionaries and the quality of all the processes involved in implementing the scheme. It is therefore necessary that well-defined and yet flexible and participatory institutional structures are put into place at all levels from state level to village level. ASHA will be a central component of the National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) and its institutional structure would reflect this. (a) The District Health Society under the chairmanship of the District Magistrate/ President Zila Parishad will oversee the selection process. Society will have representation from all related departments and civil society and the Panchayti Raj Institutions (PRIs). The Society will designate a District Nodal Officer and a Block Nodal Officer preferably a senior health person. The job of the Nodal Officers at the District and Block will be to facilitate the selection process by involving the Gram Sabha and Gram Panchayat, holding of training for ASHA and for trainers as per the guidelines of the scheme. (b) At the village level it is recognized that ASHA cannot function without adequate institutional support. The women's committees (like self help groups or women's health committees), Village Health & Sanitation Committee of the Gram Panchayat, peripheral health workers especially ANMs and Anganwadi workers, and the trainers of ASHA and in-service periodic training would be the major source of support to ASHA. (c) At the block level, ASHA scheme will have a Block Co-ordination Committee with the Block Nodal Officer/Block Panchayat President as Chairperson. This committee will ensure involvement of PRIs and civil society and support of all related departments at the block level. Actual arrangements would vary depending on availability of a suitable NGO and of relative strengths and merits of different participants. If a suitable NGO is available at block level, the NGO would also be a member of the coordination committee. (d) The Gram Panchayat would lead the ASHA initiative in three ways: i. The Gram Sabha undertakes (through the process outlined earlier) the selection of ASHA. ii. It is involved in supporting the ASHAs in their work and itself undertaking many health-related tasks through its statutory health committee. All ASHAs will be involved in this Village Heath & Sanitation Committee of the Panchayat either as members or as special invitees (depending on the state laws). iii. It develops the village health plan in coordination with ASHA.Module 2 97iv. A part of the compensation incentive would be provided by/routed through Panchayats. (e) In such situations where an NGO with good track record is available in the block level or a good NGO is willing to take up the responsibility, the entire selection and facilitation and training process can be given to the NGO . This will, however, not reduce the role of the Block Co-ordination Committee in overseeing the processes. (f) The state level NRHM committee would have to monitor and support the District Health Society and District Nodal Officer through a network of coordinators/support NGOs. (g) The ASHA strategy would be reflected in the State Action Plan, for which funds shall be released under the overall allocations under NRHM / RCH-II. 5. Role and Integration with Anganwadi Anganwadi Worker (AWW) will Guide ASHA in performing the following activities: Organizing Health Day once/twice a month. On health day, the women, adolescent girls and children from the village will be mobilized for orientation on health-related issues such as importance of nutritious food, personal hygiene, care during pregnancy, importance of antenatal check up and institutional delivery, home remedies for minor ailment and importance of immunization etc. AWWs will inform ANM to participate & guide organizing the Health Days at Anganwadi Centre (AWC). AWWs and ANMs will act as resource persons for the training of ASHA. IEC activity through display of posters, folk dances etc. on these days can be undertaken to sensitize the beneficiaries on health related issues. Anganwadi worker will be depot holder for drug kits and will be issuing it to ASHA. The replacement of the consumed drugs can also be done through AWW . AWW will update the list of eligible couples and also the children less than one year of age in the village with the help of ASHA. ASHA will support the AWW in mobilizing pregnant and lactating women and infants for nutrition supplement. She would also take initiative for bringing the beneficiaries from the village on specific days of immunization, health checkups/health days etc. to Anganwadi Centres. 6. Role and Integration with ANM Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) will Guide ASHA in performing following activities: She will hold weekly/fortnightly meeting with ASHA and discuss the activities undertaken during the week/fortnight. She will guide her in case ASHA had encountered any problem during the performance of her activity. AWWs and ANMs will act as a resource person for the training of ASHA. ANMs will inform ASHA regarding date and time of the outreach session and will also guide her for bringing the beneficiary to the outreach session. Manual for MNGOs 98ANM will participate & guide in organizing the Health Days at AWC. She will take help of ASHA in updating eligible couple register of the village concerned. She will utilize ASHA in motivating the pregnant women for coming to the sub-centre for initial checkups. She will also help ANMs in bringing married couples to sub centres for adopting family planning. ANM will guide ASHA in motivating pregnant women for taking full course of IFA T ablets and TT Injections etc. ANMs will orient ASHA on the dose schedule and side affects of oral pills. ANMs will educate ASHA on danger signs of pregnancy and labour so that she can timely identify and help the beneficiary in getting further treatment. ANMs will inform ASHA on the date, time and place for initial and periodic training schedule. She will also ensure that during the training ASHA gets the compensation for performance and also TA/DA for attending the training. 7. Working Arrangements ASHA will have her work organized in the following manner. She will have a flexible work schedule and her work load would be limited to putting in only about two to three hours per day, on about four days per week, except during some mobilization events and training programmes. A. At AWC: She will be attending the AWC on the day when Immunization/ ANC sessions are being organized. At least once or twice a week, she would organize health days for health IEC, rudimentary health checkup and advice including medicine and contraceptive dispensation. B. At home: She will be available at her home so as to work as depot holder for distribution of supplies to needy people or for any assistance required in terms of accompanying a woman to delivery care centre/FRU or RCH camp. C. In the Community: she will organize/attend meetings of village women/ health committees and other group meetings and attend Panchayat health committees. She will counsel and provide services to the families as per her defined role and responsibility. 8. Training Capacity building of ASHA is critical in enhancing her effectiveness. It has been envisaged that training will help to equip her with necessary knowledge and skills resulting in achievement of the scheme's objectives. Capacity building of ASHA has been seen as a continuous process. Training Strategy Induction Training: After selection, ASHA will have to undergo series of training episodes in order to acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and confidence for performing her spelled out roles. Considering the range of functions and tasks to be performed, induction training may be completed in 23 days spread over a period of 12 months. The first round may be of seven days, to be followed by another four rounds of training, each lasting for four days to the complete induction training Module 2 99 Training materials : These would be prepared according to the roles and responsibilities that the ASHA would need to perform. Her envisaged functions and tasks will be expanded into a listing of competencies and the training material would be prepared accordingly. The training materials produced at the national level would be in the form of a general prototype which states may modify and adapt as per local needs. The training material will include facilitator's guide, training aids and resource material for ASHAs Periodic Trainings: After the induction training, periodic re-training will be held for about two days, once in every alternate month at appropriate level for all ASHAs. During this training, interactive sessions will be held to help refresh and upgrade their knowledge and skills, trouble shoot problems they are facing, monitor their work and also for keeping up motivation and interest. The opportunity will also be used for replenishments of supplies and payment of performance-linked incentives. ASHAs will be compensated for attending these meetings. On-the-job Training : ASHAs need to have on the job support after training. During the initial training phase and during the later periodic training phase it is needed to provide on the job training to ASHAs in the field, so that they can get individual attention and support that is essential to begin and continue her work. ANMs while conducting outreach sessions in the villages will contact ASHA of the village and use the opportunity for continuing education. NGOs can also be invited to take up the selection; training and post training follow up. Similarly block facilitators identified earlier for selection of ASHAs can also be engaged for regular field support. Training of trainers : A cascade model of training is proposed. At the most peripheral level, block trainers (who are the members of identified block training teams) would have to spend at least the same number of days in acquiring the knowledge and skills as ASHAs. These T oTs will also have to be similarly phased. These trainers should be largely women and chosen by the block nodal officer. The block teams would be trained by a district trainer's team (or Master trainers) who are in turn trained by the state training team. The duration of T oTs for District Training T eams (DTT) and State Training T eams (STT) will be finalized by the states depending on the profile of the members to be selected as DTT and STT . Constitution of Training teams: It follows that each state, district and block would have a training team compromising of three-four members. Existing NGOs especially those working on community health issues at the district/block level may also be entrusted with the responsibility for identifying trainers and conducting of TOTs The trainers would be paid compensation for the days they spend on acquiring or imparting training - both camp-based training and on the job training. The similar guideline applies to the district level also where trainers would be drawn in from Programme Managers and NGOs. The State Institutes of Health and F amily Welfare along with reputed and experienced NGOs would form training teams at the state level. State level training structures to be used for trainings Manual for MNGOs 100under various National Health and Family Welfare Programmes Trainings may be adhered wherever feasible. Continuing Education and skill upgradation : A resource agency in the district of state (preferably an NGO) will be identified by the State. The resource agency in collaboration with open schools and other appropriate community health distance education schemes will develop relevant illustrated material to be mailed to ASHAs periodically for those who would opt for an eventual certification. Venue of training : The principle of choice of venue shall be that the venue should be close to their habitation that the training group should not be more than 25 to 30. In most situations this could be the PHC or alternatively Panchayat Bhavan or other facilities that are available. National Level : At the national level the NIHFW would in coordination with the National Rural Health Mission & its technical support teams and the Training Division of the Ministry will co-ordinate and organize periodic evaluation of the training programmes. The findings of these concurrent evaluations should be shared with State Governments. State level : At the State level, the State Institute of Health and Family Welfare (SIHFW) in coordination with the State Training Cell of Directorate of Family Welfare will oversee the process of training, monitor and organize concurrent evaluation of training programme. 9. Compensation to ASHA ASHA would be an honorary volunteer and would not receive any salary or honorarium. Her work would be so tailored that it does not interfere with her normal livelihood. However ASHA could be compensated for her time in the following situations: a) For the duration of her training both in terms of TA and DA (so that her loss of livelihood for those days is partly compensated) b) For participating in the monthly/bi-monthly training, as the case may be. (For situations (a) and (b), payment will be made at the venue of the training when ASHAs come for regular training sessions and meetings). c) Wherever compensation has been provided for under different national programmes for undertaking specific health or other social sector programmes with measurable outputs, such tasks should be assigned to ASHAs on priority (i.e. before it is offered to other village volunteers) wherever they are in position. (For situation (c) disbursement of compensation to ASHAs will be made as per the specific payment mechanism built into individual programmes). d) Other than the above specific programmes, a number of key health- related activities and service outcomes are aimed within a village. (F or example all eligible children immunized, all newborns weighed, all pregnant women attended an antenatal clinic etc). The Untied Fund of Module 2 101Rs.10,000/- at the sub-centre level (to be jointly operated by the ANM and the Sarpanch) could be used as monetary compensation to ASHA for achieving these key processes. The exact package of processes that form the package would be determined at the state level depending on the supply-side constraints and what is feasible to achieve within the specified time period. (For situation (d) the payment to ASHAs will be made at the Panchayat level). Group recognition/ awards may also be considered. Non-monetary incentive e.g. exposure visits, annual conventions etc can be considered. A drug kit containing basic drugs should be given. A suggestive/indicative compensation package for ASHA for training and various services provided by her is enclosed at Annexure-I. This would be finalized subsequently in consultation with the States and various other stak eholders in due course. 10. Fund-flow Mechanism for ASHA It is proposed that funds for making the payments to ASHA may flow from Centre to States through SCOVA mechanism and from State SCOVAs to District Health Societies. The District Health Societies will further disburse the funds as follows: (a) The compensation to ASHA based on measurable outputs would be given under the overall supervision and control by Panchayat. For this purpose a revolving fund would be kept at the Panchayat. The guidelines for such compensation would be provided by the District Health Mission, led by the Zila Parishad. (b) For the compensation money under the various national programmes/ schemes, the programmes have in-built provisions for the payment of compensation. These compensations will be made in accordance with the programme guidelines. (c) ASHA would be entitled for TA / DA for attending training programmes. She would be given the amount at the venue itself. 11. Monitoring and Evaluation GOI has set up following indicators for monitoring ASHA. Process Indicators (a) Number of ASHAs selected by due process; (b) Number of ASHAs trained, (c) % of ASHAs attending review meetings after one year; Manual for MNGOs 102Outcome Indicators (a) % of newborn who were weighed and families counseled; (b) % of children with diarrhoea who received ORS, (c) % of deliveries with skilled assistance; (d) % of institutional deliveries, (e) % of JSY claims made to ASHA, (f) % completely immunized in 12-23 months age group. (g) % of unmet need for spacing contraception among BPL; (h) % of fever cases who received chloroquine within first week in an malaria endemic area; Impact indicators (a) IMR; (b) Child malnutrition rates; (c) Number of cases of TB/leprosy cases detected as compared to previous year. While MIS to be setup for NRHM will ensure timely information on k ey inputs and process indicators, information on impact indicators will come through DRHS being planned for RCH2. During bi-monthly meetings, ANM should get information from ASHAs regarding the progress made and consolidate the report at PHC by Medical officer.Module 2 103Budget & Financial Mechanisms for Training ASHAs For an unit of 100 ASHAs (appox. for a block) (Amount in Rs.)

About this Unit This detailed module on data collection is designed around the two tools- conducting base line survey and Focused Group discussions (FGD) to facilitate training of MNGOs by the RRCs and further for FNGOs by the MNGOs. Steps Background information - discussion (10 minutes) BLS objectives (10 minutes) Walking through the objectives - power point. Sample selection (50 minutes) Respondent selection (20 minutes) Training aids: Copies of the handout for each participant, chart paper and markers 3.1.1: Sample Selection Notes for the facilitator Explain purpose, methodology, types of sampling and caution to be exercised while selecting sample. At the end of this sub-session participants will understand the rationale of sampling and choosing appropriate sampling methodology to conduct BLS. Keep a handout of this session readyUnderstanding Baseline SurveyModule 3 107Method interactive discussion using the hand out Duration 50 minutes Handout T ypes of Sampling, BLS Sampling Methodology 3.1.2: Respondent Selection Method Interactive discussion using hand out Duration 20 minutes Handout Respondent SelectionManual for MNGOs 108Before starting the substantive sessions, the facilitator will discuss the following with the MNGO participants: Rationale for working in unserved/underserved areas : These are socio-economically backward areas, which do not have access or have partial access to health care services from the existing government health infrastructure. These areas may be urban slums, tribal, hilly and desert areas including SC/ST inhabitation. FNGOS and MNGOs are expected to compliment the system by their involvement in the service delivery , with a specific focus on these areas. Steps in selecting unserved/underserved areas Identification and selection of un-served/underserved areas should be undertaken by MNGOs in a participatory manner. Consulting and involving the district health/block officials, PHC staff, ANM, and NGOs (potential FNGOs) from the area is critical. Reason for conducting only Baseline Survey (BLS) and not Community Needs Assessment: (CNA) : Based on the existing data, the priority RCH service delivery areas that could be addressed in the MNGO scheme have been defined in the NGO guidelines by the Government of India. Therefore, instead of conducting CNA, which primarily facilitates identification of priority service delivery areas, FNGOs are to conduct a base line survey (BLS) in the under served/unserved areas for establishing the current status of RCH service delivery. The BLS, apart from helping the FNGOs to identify their interventions, will also facilitate comparing the project progress. Use of Focus Group Discussions (FGD) in getting community perspectives and practices: T o supplement BLS findings and obtain qualitative information on current community perspectives and practices regarding RCH services. Preparatory activities by FNGO prior to conducting BLS and FGD: This is critical because FNGO should have sufficient knowledge of the community, its location, general and health situation. FNGOs should also have a clear understanding of why that area has been identified as 'underserved or unserved' area by the government and the NGOs. FNGOs need to get appropriate permission from the village leaders and PRI before starting any activity in the community. FNGO also should be aware of the health providers (if any), their schedule, services provided. FNGO should be familiar with the kind of resources available within the community by way of volunteers, other NGOs, support services etc. Background - Points for discussion Handout 1Module 3 109 FNGO should also conduct interviews with the health key informants (ANM, AWW , MO, health worker, health volunteer) who may give valuable inputs relating to why certain health practices exist, why there is resistance to certain practices and what kind of support can be obtained from the government system (where possible). FNGO could collect secondary data from the ANM and AWW records and registers and also from PRI records. Some of the critical demographic data such as sex ratio among adolescent population as well as 0-6 years population need to be collected from the district data. These steps apart from helping in rapport building with the community, helps the FNGO to develop a good understanding of the community prior to conducting the BLS and FGD for collecting quantitative and qualitative data from the community. Guidelines for identifying unserved/underserved areas The identification of unserved/underserved areas is important to improve service delivery provisions for the unreached/marginalized populations. Implementation of project activities in identified unserved/underserved areas will accelerate the achievement of RCH goals. 1. Concept Unserved/underserved areas are those socio-economically backward areas that do not have access to health care services from the existing government health infrastructure. These areas may be urban slums, tribal, hilly and desert areas including SC/ST inhabitation. Resistance groups may be included in unserved/ underserved areas. Poor RCH indicator is a relative term. An indicator may be considered poor if it is performing below the district/state/national average. 2. Criteria It is not possible to pin down a single criterion to identify underserved/unserved area. Given below is the suggested criteria that may be adopted for identification of unserved/underserved areas: a) Area in which the following RCH indicators are poor: 1. Proportion of girls marrying before 18 years 2. Proportion of girls conceiving before 20 years 3. Proportion of women full ANC 4. Proportion of women that received 2TT injections 5. Proportion of women that received100 IFA tablets 6. Proportion of eligible couples using spacing methods 7. Proportion of institutional deliveries 8. Proportion of deliveries conducted by skilled birth attendants 9. Proportion of children between 12-23 months fully immunized 10. Proportion of females with symptoms of RTI/STI 11. Proportion of males with symptoms of RTI/STI 12. Number of infant and maternal deathsManual for MNGOs 110Presence/Absence of MO, ANM and LHV 1. The position of MO, ANM and LHV are vacant or partly filled 2. If the positions are presently filled, how long (days/months) will they remain in position in the area throughout the year 3. Frequency of transfer and replacement 4. Non-availability of trained staff b) Equipment and infrastructure at sub-centre/PHC 1. Absence of government health services (facilities) 2. No building or building with dilapidated rooms 3. Absence of minimal infrastructure like storage space, chair, table, weighing machine, vaccine box, water source, stove, syringe, growth charts, immunization cards, registers, contraceptives, delivery kits, gloves, etc. 4. Non-functional equipment, such as faulty weighing machines, broken vaccine box, rusted blade in delivery kits, non-functional water source, etc. 5. Sub-centre/PHC building is quite far from the village and/or difficult to reach due to rough terrain 6. Difficulty in reaching sub-centre/PHC building for 9 months a year due to weather conditions 3. Process Identification and selection of unserved/underserved area should be done in a participatory manner by involving the following: 1. Government district and PHC representatives 2. MNGOs and NGOs (potential FNGOs) from the area 3. Representative of state and district RCH society In addition to the above-mentioned criteria, the group may discuss the following questions to identify unserved/underserved areas: Do people get required services from the government facilities? How often and what percentage of people use these services? T o what extent are these services available in the private sector in the area? T o what extent people avail of these private services? What is the quality assurance of these services? How much is the distance to the nearest health facility? Once the unserved/underserved areas are identified, they should be prioritized, as it may not be possible to implement project activities in all the identified underserved/underserved areas due to non-availability of FNGO and/or limited budgetary allocation to MNGOs. In such a scenario, the identified areas should be prioritized to implement project activities.Module 3 111For the facilitator : Explain each objectives of the BLS along with relevant examples. At the end of this sub-session participants will get clarity on the objectives of the BLS. Time required: 15 minutes Objective 1 : T o identify current status of RCH services related to Maternal and Child Health (MCH), Family Planning (FP), Reproductive Tract Infection (RTI) and Adolescent Reproductive Health (ARH) through administering BLS format (quantitative data). For example, BLS will help to find out how many children have received complete immunization1, how many couples have made choice of a particular method of FP and/or how many pregnant women delivered at home. Objective 2: Some of the key issues identified through BLS may require further probing. If BLS findings reveal that there is a large gap between the numbers of female sterilization and male sterilization, the FGD can help in providing the community perspectives, and practices regarding the contraceptive choices. For example, reasons for sensitive issues like decline in sex ratio/resistance to use a particular method of contraception/why only females undergo sterilization etc. are difficult to obtain through BLS. These issues will be captured through FGD (qualitative) data. Objective 3: T o facilitate development of project objectives. For example, if improving child immunization was found to be a key issue to be addressed, then one of the project objectives would be to increase complete child immunization from 20% (baseline) to 55% (end of project). Objective 4: T o provide inputs for assessing project progress at the mid- term and during final evaluation. For example, if the baseline data on complete child immunization is 20 %, and the mid-term review shows 45 %, it shows a clear progress in the coverage. Similar progress can be measured at the time of final evaluation. 1 A complete immunization means: One dose of BCG, 3 doses of DPT , 3 times drops of OPV and one dose of measles. Missing any one of these will be considered incomplete. BLS ObjectivesHandout 2Manual for MNGOs 112Sample Selection For the facilitator: Explain purpose, methodology, and types of sampling and caution to be exercised while selecting sample. At the end of this sub-session, participants will understand rationale of sampling and choosing appropriate sampling methodology to conduct BLS. 3.1 What is Sampling? A sample is a subset of the population. For example, to know use of FP methods by all the eligible couples (15-49 years) in the community need to be interviewed. If there are 100 eligible couples in community, interviewing all couples will take a lot of time, require more number of data collectors, more money and travel time. An alternative method is to interview 20 eligible couples and generalize results for community. This is called sampling. In this case, 20 eligible couples selected to interview are called 'sample' and 20 is the sample size. 100 eligible couples (15-49 years) form population. A good sample will represent the target population. It helps to save time, cost and at the same time get reliable results. However, sample size needs to be selected carefully. 3.2 Types of Sampling Sampling methods can be divided into probability and non-probability. In probability sampling, each unit, such as, household/child/eligible couple/ service provider has a known probability of being selected. A probability sampling is truly representative of the population from where it is drawn. Probability sampling can be divided into: simple random sampling, stratified random sampling, systematic random sampling, cluster sampling Non-probability sampling refers to the selection of a sample not based on probabilities. Purposive sampling is a type of non-probability sampling. Types of probability sampling Simple random sampling: This is a very basic method of making selection from a group. For example, if there are 15 villages and 3 are to be selected then 15 chits are to be prepared with names of the villages numbering from number 1-15. T o select 3 villages, pick up any 3 chits one by one from the 15 chits. Stratified random sampling: Villages can be grouped according to pre-defined criteria. For example, distance could be one criterion to divide villages into 3 groups. Then from each group one village is to be selected. Handout 3Module 3 113Systematic random sampling: Here, a sample is selected after every fixed interval, say, if 3 villages are to be selected from a group of 15 villages. Every 5th village will be selected. Cluster sampling: It is a natural unit, for example, sub-centre, primary health centre or anganwadi centre. Each cluster is assigned a unique number and a required number of clusters are selected randomly. Non-probability sampling Purposive sampling: In this method, the choice of sample depends on the judgment of the interviewer. For example, in a community of 100 eligible couples, 10 are to be interviewed to find out use of FP methods. In purposive sampling, the interviewer could select any 10 couples using his/her judgment. This has an element of subjectivity. Non-probability sampling method is not representative of the target population and has an element of subjectivity. In the BLS, it is important to avoid subjectivity; therefore, we will use probability sampling. 3.3 BLS Sampling Methodology The purpose of the BLS survey is to gain an understanding of the RCH status in the community. This survey will not cover 100% of households or any particular category to be interviewed. It is a representative sample of the community . The data collected through this sample, will facilitate the identification of the core issues, which is the primary step for understanding community perceptions through FGDs. Subsequently, the quantitative (BLS) and qualitative (FGD) data will enable the FNGO to priorities and choose appropriate strategies and interventions for developing a project proposal. Each FNGO is expected to cover a population of 10,000-15,000 in plain/ rural/urban areas. In the hilly, desert and tribal areas, the FNGO is expected to cover 600-9000 population for provision of service delivery. In the case of plain areas, the 10-15,000 population may be spread over in 2-3 sub centres. On the other hand, in hilly and desert terrains, 6-9,000 population may be found spread over in 2-5 sub centres, due to sparse distribution of the population. Therefore, sample size will be calculated on the basis of total population to be covered by FNGO. Distance from sub-centre is a very important factor for providing RCH services. T o establish current status of RCH service delivery, villages have been grouped (stratified) according to distance from the sub-centre. So for the purpose of BLS, stratified sampling method will be employed. Sample size: Sample size for BLS indicators has been calculated using `Sample size determination in health studies-A practical manual' WHO, Geneva 1991 and using values of indicators in the RCH India report 98-99. Manual for MNGOs 114Table 1: Sample size for the BLS indicators SN Indicators RCH-RHS India report 98-99Sample size 1 % age of eligible couples2 currently using modern FP methods42.5% 375 2 % age of ECs reporting current unmet need for FP25.3% 286 3 % age of women received complete ANC during pregnancy31.8% 333 4 % age of deliveries conducted in institutions 34.0% 345 5 % age deliveries conducted by skilled attendants40.4% 369 6 % age of 12-23 months children completely protected against 6 vaccine preventable diseases54.2% 371 7 % of eligible woman/her husband reported symptoms of RTI29.7% (F) 12.3% (M)321 156 8 % of eligible woman/her husband/ both completed treatment37.6% (F) 11.2% (M)375 152 9 % of girls and boys marrying before attaining legal age of marriage36.9% (F) 12.3% (M)357 165 10 % of married girls conceived during adolescent Not available - The recommended sample size for the BLS is 375 eligible couples ( refer table 1). As approximately 15% of population consists of eligible couples, 2500 population needs to be surveyed to get 375 eligible couples. If household size is 5.4, (NFHS II report 1998-99) then approximately 455 -500 households (allowing for non-response) are to be surveyed to get 375 eligible couples. The following sample size has been recommended for the BLS: Table 2: Sample size Population covered by FNGO Recommended sample size > 15,000 20% population 10,000-15,000 25% population < 10,000 30% population Sub-centre vs Population: Often it is asked, should the population determine the sample size or the number of sub-centres covered? 2 Married couples between the age of 15-49 yearsModule 3 1154.4 How to select sample for BLS? Note for the facilitator The following exercise may be given as a group work. The task for the participants would be to calculate the required sample size by making village selection. Situation :FNGO is implementing RCH service delivery project in 9 villages of 2 sub-centres. T otal population covered by 2 sub-centres is 7500 population (table 3). Table 3: Information to select sample villages SN Village names Population Distance from sub-centre V1 Rampur 600 3 Km V2 Sitagarh 700 4 Km V3 Nanakpur 1000 0 Km (Sub centre village) V4 Marynagar 600 8 Km V5 Yesugarh 800 7 Km V6 Mohammadpura 1100 3 Km V7 Iqbalnagar 400 14 Km V8 Sivmani 1500 0 Km (Sub centre village) V9 Balajinagar 800 11 Km T otal 7500 T o select sample for BLS, divide villages into 3 groups as per distance from the sub-centre. For instance, if farthest village is 14 kms from the sub-centre, divide the villages into three groups, 0-5 kms, 6-10 kms and more than 10 kms (table 4). Ensure each category is represented in your selection. Now randomly select one village from each of the groups (table 4). Table 4: Village selection (Illustrative) Group Distance from sub centre No. of villagesWrite numbers of villagesRandomly selected villagesPopulation Of sampled village I Up to 5 kms 5 V1, V2, V3, V6, V8V6 (Yesugarh)800 III More than (Baljitnagar) 800 T In V5 (Yesugarh-population 800) and V9 (Balajinagar-population 800) have been randomly selected as sampled villages. Population of these 3 villages is 27, 00 which is 36% of total population (7500). Since the population of sampled villages is more than recommended sample size of 30% (see table 2) there is no need to select additional villages. Let us take another scenario, if V2 (Sitagarh-population700), V5 (Yesugarh - population-800) and V7 (Iqbalnagar - population 400) are randomly selected as sampled villages (refer table 3). The combined population of these 3 villages is 1900, which is 25% of the total population (7500). Since the population of sampled villages is less than the recommended sample size of 30% (see table 2) additional village will be selected. This will be done to ensure that samples village cover at least 30% population. Selecting additional villages: It is possible that in some areas, the villages may have less population and you may not get the sufficient number of household, for the recommended sample size. Then, you need to select additional villages. Additional village(s) will be selected randomly from the non -selected villages . For the purpose of project implementation, a complete sub-center will be considered as unserved/underserved area. Even if a few villages are categorized as unserved/unserved areas, project activities will be implemented in all the sub- center villages. Therefore, complete sub-center would be considered as universe (population) for sample selection. Steps in Selection of household: After finalizing the villages to be surveyed, The FNGO needs to identify the households to be included in the survey. T owards this: The FNGO should obtain the list of households from the CMO/BDO/police station/ PRI Number the households and do a simple random selection of households. (see definition of random sampling in the previous section) Develop a village map and mark the important sites and landmarks and location of households by category. (e.g:SC/ ST population). Prior to starting the survey, it will be useful for the survey team to walk to through the village for familiarizing themselves with the village lay out, location of SC/ST population. It is important that this preparatory work is done by the FNGO in order to conduct the base line survey in a smooth manner and avoid any bias.Module 3 117At the end of this sub-session, participants will understand how to select appropriate respondents for each section of the BLS questionnaire Who is a respondent? Respondent is a person who is best suited to provide information on a specific issue. Ask the participant to give examples of appropriate group for a particular RH issue. Selecting the appropriate respondent is a critical step. In case you want to know about ANC related issues you have to identify pregnant women or lactating mothers. Like wise if you want to know about prevalence of contraceptives, you will interview the appropriate family member (adult men/ women) who can give information. BLS will collect data on maternal and child health (MCH), family planning (FP), reproductive tract infection (RTI) and adolescent reproductive health (ARH) issues. For MCH issues, data is to be collected on ANC services, institutional deliveries and child immunization. A woman is best suited to provide information on these issues. A man can also provide, but woman can provide more authentic information. For FP , both man and woman can provide information. Since eligible woman is to be interviewed for MCH issues, FP information could be obtained from her . For RTI and ARH issues both the woman and her husband, will be interviewed. The adolescent boys and girls will provide their view through their participation in the FGDs.Respondent Selection Handout 4Manual for MNGOs 118Objective 1. T o discuss the importance and need for indicators in the RCH context 2. T o explain the various types of indicators that are used and the relevance of these indicators. Outcome Participants will develop input, process, output and impact indicators for a project that they will be implementing Methodology Input, discussion and group exercise. Duration 110 minutes. Link with the previous unit In the first unit of BLS module, we discussed the sample and respondent selection in a given field area. Before developing a questionnaire it is necessary that the purpose of the study and the field (eg.MCH, FP) be clearly defined. Within a particular field there are several activities and each of these activities, when carried out regularly, are either recorded or reported. Indicators tell us the performance of these activities. In this unit we shall understand the various indicators that we should familiarize ourselves with for implementing RCH projects. Training aids Chart, marker, LCD, task sheet for the exercise. Handout No 1, 2 on Goals and Indicators Exercise To identify goal, outcome, output, and input (20 minutes). Divide participants into four groups. Give the case and ask the group to identify the goal, outcome, output, and input for the given case (10 minutes) Ask them to develop input, process, output, outcome and impact level indicators for improving use of FP methods (20 minutes)Unit 3.2 Selection of Indicators Module 3 119Notes for facilitator Discuss each indicator using a flip chart to explain why they are categorized as inputs, process, outputs, outcome and impact indicators Analyze and refine the indicators at each level with help of participants Emphasize that a population-based survey needs to be conducted to assess outcome indicators. The output and process indicators can be tracked through routine monitoring during the project period. So do not try to increase indicators in the BLS. Questionnaires given in the NFHS II and RCH-RHS report can be used to develop questions to assess additional indicators on many of the local concerns. However, do exercise caution in adding up too many indicators, since monitoring each indicator requires skill, manpower, time and follow-up.Manual for MNGOs 120Form groups of six. Identify which statement from the following reflects goal, outcome, output and input. Exercise 1 Information is made available to parents about the importance of boiling water before making infant feed. Fewer children are going to hospital to be treated for diarrhoeal diseases. Improved child health in the community. Exercise on Understanding the terms input, output, outcome & goal Increased numbers of affected children eat their feed made with boiled water. Child morbidity rates reduced in local community. More funds made available for conducting information campaign on prevention of diarrhoea Increased knowledge among parents about the importance of boiling water for making infant feed, especially when affected by diarrhoea. Exercise 2 72 women complete training as skilled birth attendants conducted by an NGO. 15 % increase in births assisted by skilled birth attendants. 100 women attend training for skilled birth attendants 12 qualified trainers conducted the training. The government of Orissa approved 25 applications from the trained women to be placed in the rural areas. The Orissa government makes funds available for the training of skilled birth attendants. 15 of the skilled birth attendants get placed within the first three months of government approval of their application. Reduction in maternal mortality. Handout 1Module 3 1212.1. Indicators What is an indicator? An indicator is a measure of an event or condition. It is a pointer to show a condition. For example, a right or left indicator in a car tells in which direction it will turn. Ask participants, What do you understand by the term \"fully immunized\"? Ask if 1 dose of BCG, 2 doses of DPT , 3 doses of OPV and 1 dose of measles vaccine meets the definition of full immunization? Explain that only when a child receives 1 dose of BCG, 3 doses of DPT , 3 doses of OPV and 1 dose for measles that this is a pointer that the child is fully immunized. An indicator can be defined as a measurable or specific aspect of a project, measurable or specific aspect of a project, measurable or specific which provides information about its status. 2.2: Criteria for selection of indicators The indicator must be valid, understandable, specific, sensitive and reliable reflection of that situation/issue, which it proposes to measure. Valid: An indicator must actually measure the issue or factor it is supposed to measure. Understandable: The indicator must be simple to define and its value must be easy to interpret in terms of reproductive health status. Specific: The indicator must only reflect changes in the issue or factor under consideration. Accessible: The data required should be available or relatively easy to acquire by feasible data collection methods that have been validated in field trials. Representative: The indicator must adequately encompass all issues or population groups it is expected to cover. Reliable: An indicator must give the same value if its measurements are repeated in the same way on the same population and almost at the same time. Ethical: An ethical indicator is one for which the gathering, processing, and presentation of the data it requires are ethical in terms of the rights of the individual to confidentiality, freedom of choice of supplying data, and informed consent regarding the nature and implication of the data required. Handout 2Manual for MNGOs 1222.3: Levels of indicators Level 1-Input Indicator Input is a set of resources required by a project. These resources include human, financial, technical and equipment. It also includes operational policies that help projects to deliver services. For example, to improve immunization status, the following are some of the inputs immunization card vaccines vaccine box refrigerator Input indicators Availability of immunization cards at sub centre Availability of vaccine box at sub-centre Availability of refrigerator to keep vaccines Level 2-Process Indicator Process es are the set of activities undertaken. For example, the following are a few activities to improve immunization status: Mobilizing community to participate in immunization campaign Organizing immunization orientation for mothers Distribution of immunization schedule cards to mothers. Process indicators Number of immunization campaigns conducted at village level Number of mothers participating in immunization orientation Number of leaflets with immunization schedule distributed to mothers. Level 3-Output Indicator An output is a direct result of project activities (inputs and process). F or example, outputs of immunization campaign and orientation to improve immunization are: Number of persons attended the camping/meeting Number of mothers aware of child immunization schedule. Output indicator Number of boys in 0-5 years age group immunized. Number of girls in 0-5 years age group immunized.Module 3 123Level 4-Outcome Indicator An outcome is the expected changes in the determinants of health over a period of time. Bringing the desired effect (outcome) is not in the control of the project. It is population dependent. In other words, the population has to change its behaviour to achieve this. Therefore, outcome is shown in terms of coverage or utilization behaviour. This can be seen over a period of time and not immediately. It is not necessarily the immediate or short-term changes or consequences produced because of project input alone. For example, the expected outcome of child immunization is dependent on access and utilization, resulting from behaviour change in the community. BLS indicators are outcome indicators. Outcome indicator % Increase in fully immunized boys (up to 24 months) in community. % Increase in fully immunized girls (up to 24 months) in community Level 5-Impact Indicator An impact cannot be measured in the life of a single project. It tak es over 10-15 years to make an impact. For example, reduction in malnutrition or reduction in MMR requires consistent efforts over a long period of time. Therefore impact is a long-term effect produced as a result of the outcome(s) of a project over a period of time. Impact, viz., reduction in infant morbidity or mortality rate could be due to any or all of the following outcomes: Improved child immunization Improved basic and comprehensive obstetric care Improved delivery practices by skilled birth attendants. Improved exclusive breast-feeding and complimentary feeding practices Impact indicators Reduction in infant morbidity and mortality Reduction in maternal mortality and morbidity Input, process and output indicators can be assessed periodically as part of monitoring during project implementation. On the other hand, an assessment of outcome and impact indicators requires a population-based survey, which is done at the time of the baseline, midterm evaluation and final evaluation. As BLS indicators are outcome level indicators, a population-based survey will be conducted at the time of BLS.

Tribal: Circle the relevant locality I.5 Village/locality name: Write the village name as in the Govt record I.6 Name of FNGO: Write the name of the FNGO 1.6a Name of MNGO: Write the name of the MNGO I.7 Household no: If available write the door numbers If not write the serial number street wise - e.g street 1 household 1 = 1.1 The preparatory work should be done before conducting the survey . The structure of the village should be known to allot the areas for the field investigators. Without proper planning and area allocation, if you do the survey there is a possibility of duplication. I.8 Date of survey: Mention the date of survey - date/month/year I.9 Religion of head of household: Ask and record the information. Do not assume the religion by name. W rite only the religion of the head of the household. Do not confuse if family membe rs follow other religion. Manual for MNGOs 140 Family is defined as the members sharing the same kitchen Develop a family tree incase of joint family. It will help you to assess the age and relationship. Head of the household should be written as said by the respondent. Write the full name of the family members Sex Ask and record F for Female and M for Male. Do not assume the sex by name Age For children less than 2 years write age in completed months, for example, for 18 months write 18m. For above 2 years write age in completed years, for example, for 16 years write 16y Probe further to find out the correct age as far as possible. E.g the mother may say the child is 2 years old. Probe further and find the completed months Do not increase or decrease the age. E.g if you decrease the age from 15 to 14 or increase from 49 to 50, there is no need to conduct the interview . Hence the field investigators should be oriented about the importance of the BLS and usage of the valuable information for understanding the current status. Marital status Ask and record the response 1. Married - Married and living with spouse 2. Unmarried - Not married 3. Widow/widower - Living without spouse due to the death of the spouse - Married but not living with spouse at 4. Separated least for 6 months 5. Unmarried but live together - Unmarried but live together. 6.

Use the following codes strictly to facilitate the data entry and avoid error 1. Head 2. Wife/husband 3. Son 4. Daughter 5. Father 6. Mother 7. Daughter- in-law 8. Son-in-law 9. Grandson 10. Granddaughter 11. Sister 12. Brother 77. Others Comments Identify eligible women (currently married woman between 15 to 49 years). I.11 How many eligible women are in the household? Write -------- (no.) Write the total number of eligible women If there are two eligible women in HH, interview both and obtain information from section II onwards. If there are more than two eligible women, interview the two youngest eligible women. Section IV The children in the age group of 12-23 months is universally followed. So we are also doing it. IV .4 - For coding purpose, the date and months should be written in binary number. For example: 7th July 2003 has to be written as 07-07-2003. General Guidelines Ask the questions as it is. You can repeat the same if the respondent does not understand the question. Do not change the meaning while asking the questions Do not alter the sequence of the question Check all the responses before leaving the house Make sure that all the questions are answered by the respondent. Hence conduct the interview individually to avoid intrusion. If there are 2 eligible women in the household, conduct the interview separately. Do not rush. Do it in a relaxed manner Probe and do not prompt Use blue ink to record the responsesManual for MNGOs 142 Probe further when the questionnaire gives 3 options but the respondent gives only one option. The purpose of the survey is to collect baseline information. At the same time, if a woman reported the problem of white discharge, counselling and guidance can be given to her on the spot for early treatment. Skipping pattern should be followed strictly Doing a survey is a skilful job. We can develop the skill only by practicing more.Module 3 143Objective T o provide an opportunity to participants for testing the format through interviews in a classroom setting Outcome Participants will be familiar with what kind of issues need to be taken care of prior to conducting interviews in the community and they will have skills to conduct interviews in the community using the BLS format Methodology Role-play. Duration 60 minutes. Training aids Chart paper, marker, LCD Hand out Guidelines for administering BLS format and Role Play guidelines for conducting interviews in the field. Exercise 1. Provide written instruction for the role-play. 2. Form participants into pairs. Practice time (15 minutes) 3. Request four sets of volunteers to conduct role-play and others to give feedback. 4. (40 minutes) 5. Wrap up by facilitator: 5 minutes. Unit 3.4 Unit title: Familiarization with BLS Format - Mock interviews (Part II)Manual for MNGOs 144 Initiate discussion with head of household/respondent with self-introduction, purpose and utility of survey Seek respondent's consent by asking if she would like to answer the questions Be sensitive towards needs of respondent/household. For example, if a respondent is cooking ask for a convenient time to return to ask the question Do not alter the sequence of questions Read the instructions very carefully and follow the same during the interview Complete the format and review the same to ensure all the relevant questions have been asked before leaving respondent's house Thank the respondent for her valuable information and time 1.2: Role Play guidelines for conducting interviews in the field. Identify two volunteers who have the experience of conducting interviews One of the volunteer to become an interviewer and the other to become a respondent The respondent has to play a role of a married woman of 24 years with one girl of 6 months and a boy of 22 months. Repeat a role-play with new volunteers. Now the respondent is a 35 year old woman who has three children aged 15 years, 12 years and 6 months. Rest of the participants to observe interview and note down observations about what worked and what did not work during the interview Participants to share observations with group members. Write down observations on flip chart and discuss each point. Facilitator/participants to clarify issues raised by group members1.1: Guidelines for administering the BLS formatHandout 1Module 3 145Objective T o enable participants to familiarize on all aspects of FGD. Outcome Participants able to understand the basic rules of conducting FGD, gain skills in the preparation of FGD guidelines through data analysis. Methodology Input, Brainstorm, group work and analysis Duration 165 minutes. Link with the previous unit After collecting quantitative information through the BLS format, it is also important to record the views, perceptions and beliefs of community members for whom a project is being proposed. In this unit, we shall be discussing all about the Focus Group Discussion technique and enable participants to use this tool for qualitative data collection. Training aids chart paper, marker, LCD. Handout Basics on FGD, group work task sheet with instruction. (1,2 ) Steps 1. Plenary discussion on FGD characteristics (40 minutes) 2. Formation of groups 3. Distribution of group task and written instructions for developing FGD guidelines. 4. Group work: 50 minutes. 5. Analysis in plenary: 60 minutes. 6. Summation by facilitator: 30 minutes. Unit 3.5 Focus Group DiscussionsManual for MNGOs 1461.1: Understanding FGD The baseline survey helps in understanding the existing status of an issue in the community. For example, from the filled baseline survey format, one can get information on the number of children immunized, number of girls married before the age of 18 years or the number of women that used a particular type of contraceptive method etc. However, it does not explain why a particular contraceptive method is more or less popular in the community, or why the number of girl children immunized is less than the boys. This qualitative information is also guided by the perceptions and practices prevailing in a community. Focus group discussion (FGD) is a tool available for collecting data on the qualitative aspects. T o make the selection of interventions based on community needs, the FNGO will have to complement the quantitative data collected through the baseline survey, with the qualitative data collected through FGDs. FGD is a specialized exercise - and is time consuming. What is FGD? FGD is a small group discussion guided by a trained facilitator. These discussions are useful for learning about the sensitive aspects that determine the health outcome in the community. A good understanding of the community is critical for the FNGO to conduct FGD in a community. Conducting an FGD requires a lot of preparation on the part of FNGO. They include: When FGD is conducted? When the NGO considers introducing a new programme or when one wants to supplement the baseline or written survey with more qualitative information or when there are grey areas or shades of opinion that requires further probing for clarity. FGD is for a definite purpose for a definite group . There is no warm up time prior to conducting an FGD. The FNGO has to do the preparations very well in advance . FNGO has to read the data from the baseline survey and decide on the questions. There may be discrepancy in data on safe deliveries, number of pregnant mother, or ANC coverage between BLS data, AWW and ANM record. FGD Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)Handout 1Module 3 147can be used for clarifying such discrepancies. Do we have to refer to each aspect of BLS in the FGD since BLS covers a number and range of issues in the four sections? It depends on the objective and which of the BLS data you want to reconfirm or verify from the concerned groups. FNGO has the option to do several FGDs as required through the year. 1.2: Preparatory Activities Permission related: Getting permission from the village pradhan, panchayat and any other forms of leadership for conducting FGDs. Venue related: Identification of a venue which is neutral, non-intrusive and does not invite 'walk in participants'. (Should not be an open place, where any one can walk in and start participating in the discussion) Panchayat building, sub center/ PHC or school could be considered as venues. Ensuring that the venue provides a conducive atmosphere or appropriate environment for the participants to speak freely. (e.g adolescent girls to speak on their menstrual issues) and where the participants are comfortable. Selection of participants and leader related: Identification of the appropriate group, who will be the prospective participants in the FGD is a critical issue. FNGO to ensure that women form the SC/ST and marginalized communities are specifically included. The selection of participants will depend on the type of issue taken up for discussion. For example, if the requirement is to know about the status of the ANC, pregnant mothers will be invited. If the issue is to discuss age at marriage, adolescent boys and girls may be invited. Remember participation is voluntary . Once identified, it is important to share the objectives and methodology of the FGD with the proposed participants. Provide transparent and clear information on the venue, time, expectations and the methodology prior to FGD. Decide the appropriate timing when the FGD can take place in consultation with them. Who will lead the discussion? Identification of a leader or a moderator (to conduct the FGD) and a recorder who will record the discussion points ) must be done in advance. Group size and participants: The FGD group cannot exceed beyond 12-15 participants. 1.3: Conducting FGD Revisit your goals, prepare the questions in advance and sequence them. Identify a methodology for getting responses according to the ability of the participants. (e.g: incase the participants are illiterate, or a mix ed audience). Manual for MNGOs 148 Choose the methodology depending on the purpose of conducting the FGFD. For example, if the FGD is required to verify a fact (more girl children are neglected because of son preference in the community). Or the FGD may be conducted to gain a new knowledge ( why the community adopts a particular child bearing practice). Rules of FGD: When the group meets review groups purpose, explain how the session will proceed, inform if there are next steps if any (especially applicable in a solution seeking FGDs since it raises the expectation). Time required: FGD cannot be conducted in half an hour or one hour. Make sure you have adequate time. There is no ideal time limit for conducting FGD. However, practice reveals that a good and complete FGD can be done in 3-4 hrs, if the preparatory work is done properly. FNGO requires resources to pay for the travel, food etc for the participants. Using video camera or recording device may make the participants uneasy or may respond to camera. Try and be discrete even in taking down notes, so that participants are comfortable. The leader or moderator needs to make sure that no one dominates or no one is keeping silent without participation. Encourage everyone to speak. Do not try to answer 'what' through an FGD-use the FGD for understanding the 'why'. Understand the 'what' through baseline data analysis, and secondary source information and primary data through key informant discussion and interviews. FGD report and feedback FGD report should be prepared on the basis of questions/issues discussed. Share the result with the FGD participants for revalidating and for any new question that arises. Role of MNGO: Build FNGO capacity for conducting FGD - Train the staff, provide guidelines, and observe a couple of FGDs.Module 3 149Form the participants into four groups. Each group should have a minimum of four to five participants. Give the two sets of data given below and ask the participants to identify the reasons for the status of the issue tak en up. When they identify the reasons, it will be used for developing FGD questions. 1) Prepare the FGD Guide for the followings. You have conducted baseline survey, you have found following responses and you want to enlarge your understanding on the issues emerging out of the following data. The total responses are 161. Which method you/your husband is currently using to avoid or delay pregnancy? 1 Modern Methods Res-ponses 2 Traditional Method Responses 3 Others 11 Female sterilization 100 21 Rhythm/safe period 000 31 Specify 12 Male sterilization 000 22 Withdrawal 000 13 IUD / Copper-T 30 14 Oral Contraceptive Pills (daily000 15 Weekly Pills (Saheli, Cetron)000 16 Condom / MNGOs 1502) Prepare the FGD Guide for the following.

When one group makes the presentation, ask the other groups to critique the same. See the logic of the analysis and the questions developed. Help the participants to choose questions that are relevant and those can help them to probe further in the FGD with a focus. The questions should be open ended not leading and should not be judgmental. This exercise is important to do because here the participants gain skills in understanding the collected data. The data given here is not real. Based on the identification of the issues, the participants will then sharpen the FGD questions and decide on the methodology to be adopted for the FGD e.g. as a question, or a drawing inviting response etc. Manual for MNGOs 152Objective 1. Planning for conducting a BLS 2. T o use the BLS format in the field situation, communicate with respondents, fill the BLS format and understand the problems that are possible to arise while doing a BLS 3. Follow all the steps as mentioned in the guideline and conduct FGD in the field situation Outcome Participants demonstrate skills in conducting BLS and FGD and are confident that they will be able to follow all the steps when training MNGO/FNGOs Methodology Field Visit, analysis and presentation of findings Duration 8 hours - field visit Link with the previous unit After learning about goals, indicators and the format, in the previous units, the last unit of module 2 is when all participants will actually test the BLS format and the FGD guidelines in a given field situation. By doing so, they will be able to relate to all the information given in the earlier units and also identify possible areas of improvement while administering the BLS format and FGD guidelines. Method Participatory and interactive. Training aids Chart papers, markers, sufficient copies of translated version of the BLS Handout Copies of the tasks to be done in groups.Unit 3.6 Collection of quantitative data and qualitative data through administering BLS and FGD respectivelyModule 3 153Steps for the field visit 1.

This should be done as part of workshop preparation. Please ensure that that the BLS format has been translated and back translated as part of workshop preparation. Field area preferably should be in one of the MNGO field sites. RRC representative along with MNGO representative to visit field area in advance to discuss with community about the purpose of visit. Meeting with community leaders (Sarpanch, women's group, village health committee, teacher, dai and AWW , etc.) will facilitate field work.dai and A WW, etc.) will facilitate field work. dai Preparatory work prior to BLS and FGD. Organize transport for field visit. Prior permission must have been obtained from the village leaders for conducting BLS and FGD. Familiarize the MNGO/FNGO participants on the format. And train them on each step. FGD guidelines must be prepared in advance based on the collected secondary data through discussion with key informants interview, observation of ANM register, Form 6, discussion with anganwadi worker, PRI anganwadi work er, PRI anganwadi members, dai and health workers. This then can be complemented by the dai and health work ers. This then can be complemented by the dai analysis of baseline survey data. FNGO participants must be fully aware of the reasons and method for collecting the data. Conducting baseline survey: Points to remember Participants should be divided into groups of two as far as possible, and each group should have a woman member and one person who knows the language spoken in the community. MNGO to allocate group of houses to each group to be visited to identity respondent and conduct interview. In case there is no eligible woman (married woman between 15-49 years), interviewer should go to ne xt house. If there are two eligible women in a household, both should be interviewed. For this purpose, section I of BLS format would be common while section II onwards would be completed for both eligible women.MNGO Preparatory Tasks for Handout 1Module 3 155 Each group should be provided extra forms from section II onwards. Each group to administer at least 3 BLS formats. When interviewer is interviewing respondent the other two group members should note down observations. Each interview will take about 20-30 minutes. In the beginning, interviews will take longer time but as interviewer becomes more familiar with BLS format, time taken to complete interview will reduce. The interviewer to ensure that the BLS format is complete. Before leaving the household, interviewer to go through the completed format for its completeness and accuracy. Interviewer to genuinely thank respondent for providing time at the completion of interview. Interviewer to identify participants (woman between the age of 15-29) years and invite them to participate in FGD. The woman should be explained about the purpose of FGD, time required, place and topic of FGD. Discussion, analysis of BLS data for development of FGD guidelines After completion of the BLS, the participants will go through the formats that they have filled. Each group to take one section of the format and analyze the emerging trends. Discuss the same in their own groups. Each group would take up analysis of about 10 formats that are completed. For example, Group 1 to manually analyze BLS format section II (on FP), group 2 to analyze section III (on ANC, institutional delivery) and group 3 to analyze section IV (on immunization) and so on. Identify trends, for example, how many couples are using any FP method. If all are using permanent method, this issue can be discussed in FGD. If ANC registration is high but complete ANC is low that needs further probing. Similarly, if all deliveries take place at home, we need to explore the reason for the same. Further, no child is fully immunized, the reason for that should be explored in the FGD. Members of the groups to share their observations within their groups about administering the BLS. What was difficult and why? What issues came predominantly? What did the observers notice? What perceptions seem to dominate a certain health the practice? The discussions will give pointers for finalizing the FGD discussion points. Record all the observations. Manual for MNGOs 156Conducting FGD Try and organize three to four FGDs. (e.g: Pregnant and lactating mothers, men's group, adolescent boys group and adolescent girls group) A maximum of 12 -15 persons can participate in an FGD. The discussion will be lead by a moderator/leader and a recorder will record proceedings. The rest of the participants need to observe the proceedings and tak e notes, especially the questions and responses, whether the moderator is able to handle all the questions, whether the participants were comfortable in answering the questions etc. Discussion on FGD data On return from the FGD Participants to discuss FGD data to document reasons for the issues emerged during the FGD. Facilitator should list down problems/constraints faced during the field visit and discuss each point by asking participants how these can be resolved. MNGO to ensure that data collected through BLS and FGD by the FNGOs are available for data entry in the computer. MNGO to analyze the data after entry and share the results with the FNGO. This will facilitate the FNGO proposal development. Sample Schedule for the field visit for conducting BLS and FGD and discussions. (Approximate timings.

Discuss the characteristics of adult learners 2. Develop key factors to be followed when interacting with adult learners. Outcome At the end of the session the participants will have a clear understanding of adult learners, their characteristics and will be able to apply the principles of adult learning in training programs. Duration 90 minutes Methodology Brainstorm, discussion About this unit Up till now we have dealt with issues requiring conceptual clarity such as perspective building on RCH, baseline survey, Mother and Child Health, Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health and Family Planning. However apart from the conceptual foundation, it is equally important to understand, practice and learn how these can be delivered to the adults using a participatory approach. This unit focuses on how to deal with adult learners in a training situation. Teaching aids white board, chart paper, stand, VVIP cards, Pens, Cello tape. Notes for the facilitator This is an interactive session. Be a good listener and interact with all participants, so as to enable them to present their thoughts. Persuade the participants to apply the principles of adult learning when developing their course curriculum. Introduction ;An Adult learner, Characteristics Begin the session with an exercise on introspection and identification of characteristics of adult learners. Ask some of the participants to state what each one understands by the term 'adult learner'. An adult is a person of twenty Adult learning PrinciplesUnit 4.1Module 4 161 or more years capable of earning a living, making decisions, and has needs, feelings, aspirations, ideas and experience about life in general. This description obviously needs to be further elaborated during the course of the discussions on adult learners. Compared to children and teenagers adults have special needs and requirements as learners. Ask the participants to recall one characteristic of an adult. List the characteristics as expressed by them without changing their language or expressions. Reasons why adults want to learn T ake the discussion further by asking the participants for the reasons why adults want to learn. Introduce a VVIP card exercise here and ask each of the participants to write one reason for the same. The reasons from the participants may vary. Stick these VIPP cards on the wall/ chart. Ask group members to list the various motivating factors into sub groups. Match these with sub- groups given below: These are: Social relations: to make new friends, to meet a need for associations and friendships External expectations: T o comply with instructions from someone else, to fulfil the expectations or recommendations of someone with formal authority. Social Welfare: T o improve ability to serve mankind, prepare for service to the community and improve ability to participate in community work Personal advancement: to achieve higher status in a job, secure professional advancement ad stay abreast of competitors Escape/Stimulation: to relieve boredom, provide a break in the Escape/Stimulation: to relieve boredom, provide a break in the routine of home or work, and provide a contrast to other routine of home or work, and provide a contrast to other exacting details of life Cognitive interest: to learn for the sake of learning Cognitive interest: to learn for the sak e of learning seek knowledge for its own sake and to satisfy seek knowledge for its own sak e and to satisfy and inquiring mind. Adults learn things differently Adult learners are different from children. They learn differently and hence need different teaching or learning techniques. Link the characteristics identified in the beginning of the session when discussing this point. Some of the participants may be trainers in their own right, get them to discuss the teaching styles they use. Adults learn best interactively and in practical settings.Handout 1Manual for MNGOs 162Barriers to Learning Get the participants to list the barriers to learning. Discuss - How do we motivate the unmotivated? Barriers to learning are categorized as - Emotional, Intellectual, Physical factors. Examples of Emotional factors (applies to trainers and trainees) that may affect training include- Self -concept Motivation and responsibility for learning values and attitude Flexibility towards change Reinforcement, rewards, feedback Self or group work Comfort with lecture or facilitation Comfort with instructor and other attendees Specific Skills in a Trainer /Facilitator for training adults for creating a healthy learning environment Be a learner Be a good listener Possess good written and verbal communication skills Have a positive body language Encourage participants to share experiences Link conceptual knowledge to practical field experiences Know the existing level of knowledge and skill of participants by conducting pre-test, or asking questions at the start of the session. This will help the trainer to build up the session. Make the participants feel comfortable and important Respect participants views Reinforce the key points by stating examples, or using other techniques Conduct the session as per specified timeline Modulate your voice Have a cool head on your shouldersModule 4 163Objectives 1. Understand the difference between the three primary types of learning 2. T o prepare a lesson plan. 3. List the different methods used to increase knowledge, attitude and skills 4. Demonstrate the use of different training methods and teaching aids for interactive participatory learning Outcome Participants are familiar and demonstrate the various participatory methods that they will use when training MNGO/FNGO teams Methodology (a) Discussion and demonstration by facilitator (b) Preparation and practice teaching sessions by participants Duration (a) 120 minutes (b) T otal time 7 hours 15 minutes Link with the previous unit After understanding the Adult Learning Principles, the participants will learn the different methods of training adults. Preparation of lesson plan is the core of this unit and the methods are the various tools that can be used to communicate the same to adult learners. Besides giving a broad outline of the lesson plan and the methods, this unit also gives enough scope for participants to develop practice teaching sessions and demonstrate the same to the larger peer group. Teaching Aids White Board, Chart paper, Marker pens Handout Applying participatory principles to reproductive health related training Notes for the facilitator 1. Be attentive to the participants understanding 2. Practice all the principles of adult learning and participative training while you are conducting the session 3. At the end of the session, recap the important lessons learnt during the session.Lesson Plan and Training MethodsUnit 4.2Manual for MNGOs 1644. Remember, participative, interactive teaching and listening to the participants will help in ensuring positive attitude among trainees. Introduction (45 min) Activity 1- Lesson Plan Discuss the three different types of learning. Ask participants to think of various examples for each learning. Develop an objective for a type of learning to emphasize the link between the objective, content and the methodology . A good lesson plan is one where the contents are more or less in the 'most useful' circle of the diagram. When preparing lesson plans remember to do the following. Write session objectives, duration, and link the contents to the objectives. Venue and seating arrangements, audience and background must be known, type of questions asked or likely to be asked, languages comfortable with (both trainee and trainer). Such a lesson plan will enable the trainer to give only that much information as is essential to the participants. Interactive Learning and types of learning Learning happens in training that invites participants to solve challenging problems and apply new information to their lives and work. A famous Chinese proverb states- \" What I hear, I forget. What I see, I remember. What I do, I understand. What I think, I learn\" In interactive learning, the emphasis of learning shifts to the trainee. The trainers must make all efforts to involve the participants right from the beginning of the session. Remember, that learning occurs within each individual as a continual process throughout life. People learn at different speeds, so it is natural that they may be nervous or anxious when faced with a learning situation.

In some people, one sense is used more than others to learn or recall information. For stimulating the senses, use Handout in text Logarithms/flow charts Drawings Audio visual effects Role plays Song Mime These different ways of stimulating the senses leads to active involvement of participants in training sessions leading better learning. Training methods and teaching aids for interactive participatory learning Each of the teaching method is unique in its own way and has advantages and disadvantages. It is the trainers who can best decide what method/s they wish to use. Selection of a training method is closely linked with session objectives, lesson plan, group of trainees, level of trainees and their work e xperience including skills and attitude. The advantage that one experiences after using participative learning methods is the ease with which one is able to communicate with the trainees. Brainstorming: (15 minutes) This method is used when discussing a topic with a group of 15-20 persons. Everyone present participates in the session. The participants tak e turns in expressing their ideas that are jotted down carefully on a chart paper or white/ black board. It is important that all the expressions/views of the participants are recorded verbatim. The next step is to collate ideas and form sub themes or groups. Once the sub-groups or broad themes are identified then these could be prioritized and arranged. The discussion ends with a summary of the k ey points identified by the group. Few considerations to make brainstorming more effective: Plan the process of brainstorming carefully State the objectives at the beginning of the session Put up enough blank charts for writing Request for a volunteer from within the group to come up to the board for noting down the points Explain the process of brainstorming to the participants Ask all participants to listen carefully to their colleagues and wait for their turn. Ask the participants to speak in simple languageManual for MNGOs 166 Allow the participants to do the grouping of common ideas and give the titles/headings Display the summary points Give handouts on the topic at the end of the session Thank the participants for their participation Group Discussion (15 minutes) Discussions provide for exchange of ideas and experiences. These can be in large or small groups and are an effective way of talking through issues, problem identifications or practical skills. It is a good way to allow participants to share their experiences and ideas. During the discussion, they will share experiences, so that the experience that one participant has had may influence all the other members of the group. Another important feature of the discussion is the way in which the participants' attitudes change when they talk about their own opinions. Some considerations that can make a group discussion more effective: Break up the large group of 15-20 participants into 3-4 subgroups Each sub-group should have no more than 3-5 people, so as to allow for participation by all members Structure the discussion by providing them with a case study, problem statement and some questions for discussion or an exercise Ask the group to pick up a leader and a rapporteau who will note down the Ask the group to pick up a leader and a rapporteau who will note down the points Ask the leader to moderate the discussion so as to prevent the group from digressing into other sub-themes Inform the group about the time needed for the discussion including preparation of summary points Provide the group with VIPP cards, charts and writing markers Summarize the key points at the end of the session Classroom Demonstration (15 minutes) Skills are of three types: The type of skill required for performing a procedure where the hands have to be used very skilfully is often called psychomotor skill. When people need to talk skilfully to counsel/ persuade people on using a service, this is called communication skills. The third type of skill is thinking skill or cognitive skill. This is used for decision making, maintaining records or ordering supplies. Demonstrations are best used for enhancing psychomotor skills. A trainer who is using demonstration as a method of teaching should use the following pattern for teaching the skill. Describe the skill explain what it is, why it is important and when it should be usedModule 4 167 Demonstrate the skill let the participants see an expert (often the trainer) use the skill Arrange practice sessions and offer feedback to them on their performance Ideally, theory and practice should be taught together. Demonstrations work best with small groups; the trainer may need to conduct the demonstration more than once. Using materials that are available to the trainees in their clinical settings is most effective. Practice on an anatomical model (15 minutes) Prior to practice clinical skills training (such as injections or measuring the blood pressure) on actual patients, use of an anatomical model allows the trainees to reach a minimum level of confidence and proficiency in their clinical skills before facing a live patient. Points to be considered for practice on the anatomical model: Simulate the clinic environment as much as possible Set up instruments on table or trays as in clinic Have trainees practice talking to the patient, explaining the procedure and assessing her pain control needs Have trainees wear gloves during the procedure Place the model on the end of a high table if possible; the trainee doing the procedure may sit on a stool Allow trainees to practice as much as they need to feel comfortable with handling the instruments and getting the feel of the characteristic technique of the procedure Trainer must provide both positive and negative feedback Role Play (15 minutes) Role-playing consists of the acting out of real-life situations and problems. This method is useful for applying the knowledge that is being taught, practicing skills and generating material for discussion. Trainees can explore ways of interacting or managing different situations, and may get feedback in important areas where they wouldn't normally receive feedback in the work setting. They can also have the opportunity to reverse roles and see problems from the other perspective. Role-plays can be generated from a problem stated in class or it can be designed ahead of time and given to the participant. The players receive a description of the character he or she is to play. From the description, the player makes up the action and dialogue as the role-play progresses. The player tries to behave in the way that the character might behave when faced with a given situation or problem. The players simply behave in a natural way so that their roles and action develop as the play goes along. Manual for MNGOs 168When planning a role play: Keep the group size small 3-5 per group Either assign someone to be an observer or have the trainees to write their observations Make sure the purpose of the role play is clear to all the participants If the role play demonstrates negative actions, be sure to redo it with positive ones Keep the role-play simple and short After the play, you have the important task of guiding the discussion- ask the players questions like these: How did you feel? Are you happy with the way the situation you were acting worked out? Could you have done anything different to get better results? Then ask the audience to give their views. Summarize what the group has learnt at the end of the session Case Studies (15 minutes) This method is useful for teaching problem-solving skills and case management skills, such as complications or cases that the trainees would not normally see. Case studies are drawn from real-life situations and should be adapted when necessary to take into account local practices and conditions. These can be used before introducing a subject to get the trainees to start thinking about the topic, or they can be used afterwards to have the trainees practice what they are learning. Case studies can be used in large groups or they can break into small groups to discuss and report back to the large group. Some points for consideration: Keep the case study brief and state the problem clearly. Ask the participants to identify the problem being presented in the case? What is the solution, if any, being offered? What should have been done differently? What are the issues that we should focus on? Training aids will be as per the training techniques used.Module 4 169Context Health is a discipline that involves continuous upgradation of knowledge and skills. Health providers are usually exposed to a process known as CME or continuing medical education, which involves studying relevant journals, attending conferences and lectures in related topics. This is considered extremely important to keep abreast with latest changes and trends and thereby provide the most up to date and effective therapy. Training in gender may also be considered a form of CME, because a gender-sensitive doctor is also a better clinician where women clients are concerned. But this is easier said than done because unlike other subjects like medicine, surgery, or gynaecology and obstetrics, gender is not an information-oriented discipline. Instead it deals with the attitudes and behaviour of a person. A training in gender perforce challenges many of the deeply held beliefs of the individual, and thus presents a totally different set of challenges for both the learner and the trainer . Usual training/learning that most of us are exposed to include lectures, demonstrations, practices and self study. These methods can be quite effective for the transfer of new knowledge and skill, but unfortunately prove quite ineffective where gender sensitization is concerned. Concepts in gender usually mean nothing until understood at affective (emotional) level as well. Some trainers argue that concepts in gender first need to be felt before they can be understood. The traditional training methods again prove ineffective in making a learner feel. In order to effectively understand the concept of gender and to start applying the learned concepts to behaviour, the twin principles of participatory training and adult learning are better suited. Participatory training - An introduction The traditional meaning of training has been the transfer of expertise from trainer to learner. In such training the emphaisis is often on the transfer of knowledge. In this set up the trainer Defines the context and content of the learning Remains in control of the learning situation Is the repository of knowledge and experiences - the expert This kind of training very closely mimics the school/college learning situation, the only difference being that it is of a much shorter duration, and has a much clearer defined purpose. Unfortunately this kind of training also has a number of implicit assumptions (both on the part of learners and trainers) which are not strictly correctApplying participatory principles to reproductive health related training Handout 1Manual for MNGOs 170 Increased subject matter knowledge automatically leads to desired change in behaviour/competence Knowledge is objective and value neutral Training is the responsibility of the trainer and the training institution This has led to a situation where despite the increasingly large number of trainings that are being organised as part of new programme initiatives, training continues to be viewed either a paid break/holiday (if it is held in a relatively upmarket location) or a punishment (if it is not). Furthermore, despite repeated training and even when trainees are able to parrot definitions, there is very little actual change in the competence desired. T oday, one on the greatest ills besetting the state health services is a widespread attitudinal laxity and all the training that has been organised has done little to increase provider motivation. Adult learning Participatory training principles coupled with those of adult learning pedagogy has emerged from the relative inability of traditional training in dealing with adult learning situation particularly when dealing with attitude and motivational aspects. Pioneered by Paula Frere (a noted educationist from Brazil) and Malcolm Knowles (educationist from the US) this approach is a departure from the usual school/college model of learning/teaching. Some of the assumptions of this approach include: Knowledge is almost never value neutral - the possession of knowledge provides power to the possessor. A small example of this is the ongoing struggle about the right to information that is being demanded by various groups and which the Indian government is reluctant to pass the bill. Where health care is concerned the healthcare provider has the knowledge about the human body and its working - the source of wonder for the common person who then equates the doctor to a God. Doctors are often unwilling to share the patients' disease process to the person concerned, and if they do so they use such obtruse jargon that the person hardly understands what he is being told. Knowledge does not automatically lead to change in behaviour or action - the person needs to be convinced first. In the case of gender this is a block at every stage. Men in mast part of our country are brought up believing that they are superior. This reflects in all forms of discrimination that many of the trainees themselves would be practising. T o assume that the mere definitions of gender and gender discrimination and a statutory mention of equality will change such deeply entrenched values is being na\u00efve. In order to do so the person must be convinced - understand the feeling of discrimination himself/ herself before she/he will take any steps in her/his life to reverse the trend. Learners themselves are a rich source of experience and knowledge - The primacy of external information in the entire learning process often Module 4 171undermines the importance of experience. For adults, experience is a rich source of learning. In order to take their learning forward these learners must examine their own state of current knowledge (which is based on their experiences) and then take the learning forward. This makes the learning more permanent and also introduces a process of constant reexamination and learning. Learning stops being a static process - increasing in quantum in a stepwise manner during trainings to a process where training increases the acceleration of an already increasing slope. The collective is a powerful medium and tool for learning - School/college type learning emphasises individual learning especially through the system of individual examination and tests. But where individual experiences are supposed to provide an important component to the learning process, the collective provides a much larger experience bank to deal with. Further the collective also allows for a more thorough analysis of experiences, a sharing of different perspectives, and a medium for trying out new hypothesis and behaviours. A final assumption of this approach is that people can change, but that they can and will change only if they are themselves convinced about the need to change. Thus if a training is relevant to the life of the individual trainee, she/he will learn (at her/his own pace and needs), provided a supportive atmosphere is provided. The practice of participatory training In order to actualise these principles, special care needs to be tak en in conducting a training session. Some of the key considerations that need to be kept in mind while conducting participatory training and ways to do so are described below. Learner centred Comfortable, respectful environment Openness - supportive environment Cooperation and collective learning Learning through active discovering/analysis Importance of learners experiences Trainer as facilitator Action oriented Seating The usual arrangement of a learning situation is hierarchical. The trainer is usually seated at one end while the learners are arranged in rows in front of the trainer. This arrangement does not allow much interaction between learners and establishes the trainers as different/superior. A circular seating arrangement is more democratic - and allows for greater all round interaction. A seminar/conference type round table, while being democratic, is imposing and may inhibit some individuals. A more informal circular arrangement either on chairs or on the ground may be Manual for MNGOs 172more suitable for gender training. These adaptations allow the training to be learner centred, and encourage a comfortable learning environment. Inter-participant interactions This is essential if there has to be collective learning. In many training workshops, participants are seldom encouraged to interact with each other . The women usually sit as a clearly defined group as do the men. Official hierarchies are strictly maintained. In order to make the participants comfortable, and to start a process of challenging established hierarchies and patterns of behaviour , it may be a good idea to encourage participants to call each other by their first names, sit in a gender-mixed manner, and use ice-breaking exercises to promote friendliness and increase group energy. Ice breakers/Energizers These are short fun exercises, which enable the participants to become uninhibited, release stress and increase interpersonal communication. These are essential for building trust, comfort levels, breaking hierarchies etc. If possible trainees themselves should be encouraged to conduct games and facilitators should participate, so this reinforces the conscious breakdown of hierarchy. Group tasks and exercises These will enable the participants to work cooperatively with others. It enables collective analysis and problem solving, enables negotiation between group members and also encourages group norm setting and action. Use of experience based learning methods These can include case studies, films or even role-plays. This encourages the use and analysis of experiences and development of theoretical frameworks based on experiences. Learners contribute to the training agenda and in the management of logistics This is done by including a session on expectations and evolving the training objectives in line with these expectations. Unrealistic and unrelated expectations can be reasonably removed from the training agenda - but doing so in a transparent and democratic manner makes the training more learner centric. Establish the logistic arrangements in consultation with the learners. T rainees should be made responsible for simple logistic arrangements like time keeping, arrangement of the training venue and reporting. Trainer as facilitator T wo-way communication is a key feature of participatory training. The learners should be encouraged to make guesses and independent analyses, and the Module 4 173facilitators should not thrust their own analyses on learners as the only correct one. If a particular exercise does not lead to the desired learning conclusion the trainer should not dismiss the conclusion arrived at but simply state a different way of looking at the situation (the desired learning outcome). P articipatory training encourages questioning and clarification of doubts. This means that the trainer cannot deliver a predetermined lecture and expect the trainees to learn. The facilitator has to be prepared to answer queries and doubts from different perspectives and this means that despite not being in the role of an e xpert the trainer needs greater mastery of her/his subject matter. This does not preclude the trainer from acknowledging that she/he does not know about a certain matter and promising to check out as soon as possible, and then informing the group. Trainer teams Since participatory training is activity/exercise based, and encourages a two-way interaction/communication, it requires greater energy to facilitate than a lecture based training session. Thus it is often a good idea for trainers to work as teams rather than as individuals. This not only enables the trainers to share different trainer tasks, but also enables greater interaction between trainer and facilitators. Flexibility The training schedule has to be flexible to incorporate new learning agenda, participant's pace of learning and so on. This flexibility is in line with learner centredness but should not be an excuse for learners/trainers to promote anarchy. Learners should also be encouraged to be flexible; especially for timing of training. Once the need for the training has been jointly established through the session on hopes and expectations the learners should be held responsible for enabling that these expectations be met within the stipulated time frame. Gender training requires an intensity of interaction that is not possible within a 10-5 pm training framework. Qualities of an effective participatory trainer Some key competencies of the facilitator in participatory training include: Asking questions Asking questions is one of the cornerstones of participatory training. When the facilitator asks appropriate questions it helps in two ways - It allows the facilitator to understand the participant's background and that can help in grounding the discussion at the level of the participants. The second use of questions is that it helps the participant to share her/his experiences. An analysis of these experiences is then useful in arriving at new principles which can then be converted into new action. In this manner a learning cycle is established : Manual for MNGOs 174This can be illustrated by the question sequences used in different sessions For example in the session on power and vulnerability the participants are made to go on an exercise and then their feelings are linked with principles and action- After the game ask the participants how they Feel after seeing the exercise (experience) Ask the participants when they moved back, when they moved forward (analysis) Why did they move forward and backward (analysis) How does this relate to our society (new principles) In this case the entire cycle is followed and the final question deals with how participants would change the situation - which is the action plan being alluded to. Debriefing consolidating and summarizing These three are very essential components of any session. After a task has been set - eg. case study with questions, group exercise or even a role-play the group task has to be presented by the group and this presentation must lead to the required learning objective. This process requires debriefing, consolidation and summarising. After a group has completed its task the first job is to ask them to present their task. Presentation of group tasks can be equally time consuming as the group task themselves and if different groups have the same task it may be good idea for different groups not to present their whole work but cover all the groups be asking them to present part of their deliberations. The other way is to focus on the crucial aspect of the group work and asking the groups to only present that aspect - viz in the group task on gender analysis the groups can be requested only to present Social vulnerabilities Response of family Response of health system (refer to session notes) Or two groups present two of these and two groups two other points. This can help in saving time, without taking away from the focus of learning. After the groups have presented their discussion the facilitator either asks further questions on the presentation or straight away uses the data presented to draw ActionPlan Experience N ew principlesAnalysis Module 4 175conclusions. This drawing of conclusions with the help of the data and the discussion is known as consolidation and summarising. In some cases the data is transparent and only summarising is enough, in others the common threads have to be woven and then we call it consolidation. Listening This is another key competency, and it may seem too obvious for being put up as a separate competency. Unfortunately we do a lot of hearing, but very little listening, which means paying attention to what is being heard, analysing it with an open mind and then responding. Too often we have our own fixed notions about many things and despite hearing we do not carefully listen to what is being said and dismiss it. This cannot be done in participatory training. The facilitator must be carefully listening to all the answers to the questions, evaluate them in the light of the learning objectives and then respond respectfully. Dismissing ideas as absurd and irrelevant may antagonise participants who will then try to disrupt proceedings. This may also lead to some important data being missed out. Different ways of sharpening listening skills is to ask questions/clarifications, summarising and putting forth what you have understood by examples. Preparation This is another essential competency - if not an essential pre-requisite. Participatory training does not depend on one-sided communication and allows full freedom to the participant to ask question and challenge the facilitator . The facilitator must be prepared for these eventualities. Further more participatory training methods often use a number of materials/learning aids lik e instruction sheets for games, chart paper or OHP sheets and markers etc. Thus the facilitator must be prepared with Training content Operational details of the method being used Debriefing and consolidation framework and Ancillary materials It is very difficult to walk into a training from somewhere and conduct a participatory training session, even for the most skilled and experienced facilitator. The challenge for a participatory trainer Medicine and health is becoming more and more an exact science where logic, evidence and replicability of experience are held as the precursors of truth. The new knowledge is applied into new practice and once the skill has been honed the practitioner is free to apply the skill on his/her own. Also the acquiring of a new skill often leads to an increase of personal ability and competence, in short one is better positioned to deal with a situation, one is in better control. In gender this is not necessarily so. The study of gender is not an e xact science; its principles are derived more from experience and observation than through logic Manual for MNGOs 176and replicable experiments. The experimenter/student cannot be a disinterested party as she/he has her/his own assumption, which she/he needs to challenge and understand and if necessary change. Gender training assumes that the trainer/facilitator is also a believer if not a practitioner in the concepts that are being discussed. A gender sensitive person is expected to be considerate towards the person who is being discriminated against. In many cases the doctors who come to attend this training are people in positions of authority and wield power over family members, members in their staff and their patients. After other kinds of training this power can increase, because the facilitator now knows more, is more competent, but after gender training the person is supposed to become more considerate - give up power over patients and also over family members (gender is a very personal issue as well). This relinquishing of power is a very threatening idea and participants will feel uncomfortable. The facilitator needs to not only verbally encourage individuals, but also provide a model. The facilitator is a person with authority - but the facilitator in gender training must provide examples through her/his own behaviour about how they share this authority. This can be a powerful learning medium for the participants. Other essential qualities of a gender trainer include Friendly, interactive and good communication skills Humility and openness Flexibility Resourcefulness - one needs to be able to think up of alternatives. Remember the Peter Principle - anything that can go wrong - will. Conducting the Participatory Training programme Pre-training preparation Conducting a training programme is not the only responsibility that the facilitator has. Often the facilitator also has some administrative responsibilities related to the training as well. Thus the pre-training preparation can roughly be divided into content relation preparation and administrative preparations. As far as content related preparations are concerned the facilitator needs to : Understand the background of participants - where they are coming from, what are they expected to go back and do Review the training design - match its objectives and proposed methodology with the need and profile of participants Prepare for and strengthen the theoretical understanding (knowledge) on the different sessions that the facilitator is supposed to conduct Identify appropriate reading material Prepare any training material that needs to be made, etc. Module 4 177As far as administrative arrangement are concerned these include Decide on the dates according to convenience of trainees, other resource persons as well as keeping holidays and festivals in mind Inform the participants Finalise the venue and arrangements - are they appropriate for the kind of training being arranged Arrange for stationery and other aids like TV , VCR, OHP etc. Arrange for the duplication of reading material Check the food and board arrangements Travel arrangements for participants and other resource persons During the training As indicated above the facilitator may have two different kinds of responsibilities during the training as well. While it is best to get separate individuals to assist in the administrative aspects of the training, it may be the responsibility of in house facilitators (as opposed to guest facilitators) to look after some of the administrative arrangements. During the training the facilitator must be able to follow the pulse of the participants very closely. While the design remains a guide for conducting the training the facilitators must be alive to the need of adjusting the design according to some emerging needs and issues with regard to participant. In most training there are more than one facilitator and there is great need for the facilitators to continuously check with each other about the situation of the participant group and progress of the training along anticipated lines. In most training with more than one facilitator the common practice is that facilitators only come in during their own sessions and then leave. This is not a good practice when using a participatory methodology. The other facilitator should also continue to stay on in the session and fulfill supportive roles like Assisting the main facilitator to check whether everyone is joining in If there are group tasks given then the co-facilitator can go around the groups and help in clarifying the task The co-facilitator can act as an extra pair of ears and eyes as well - noting when someone wants to make a contribution or has a question and drawing the attention of the main facilitator to that person The co-facilitator should refrain from making any content related contribution to the session, but if she or he feels the absolute urge to do so, then she should do so only after taking permission from the main facilitator. When two facilitators are present it is usually easier to gauge the progress of the training as well as make mid-course corrections. A team of facilitators can also be very helpful in improving their own work through continuous feedback from colleagues. Manual for MNGOs 178Things to look out for Any training conducted according to participatory principles is an occasion for different kinds of group processes to manifest themselves. These processes can be very useful in carrying the learning process forward, but can also be counter productive as well. The facilitator must be skilled in understanding the processes that are taking place during the training, use these to further the learning process as well as diagnose possible disruptions and tak e preventive action. These are special skills required of a facilitator of participatory trainings and trainings because in the traditional set up learning is expected to take place at the individual level and interactions between/among participants is neither necessary nor encouraged. Whenever a number of individuals interact with each other in a common domain (or group), it has been observed that the set of individuals go through some common processes. Various behavioural scientists have described these processes, and a common framework for understanding their behaviour is given below: When the set of individual meets together they try to check out who the others are. If there is someone they know from before they tend to stick together to be comfortable. Other individuals try to gauge the levels of the other participants - to see what will be the level of their influence. This initial stage where all the participants are trying to find their place within the group can been called the Stage of Forming. At this level the work is usually done at the individual level. After this individuals tend to start making linkages with others they did not know from before, but this is done tentatively with one or two individuals at first and dyads, triads subgroups forming later. Work is still being done at the individual level, though the pairs and triads can be made out by observing how participants sit, or respond one after the other and so on. This stage has been described as the Stage of Storming. In the third stage of group development, which has been described as the Stage of Norming, individuals and pairs reach out to other members of the group, and they start making common norms for group functioning. The group is now more relaxed and is able to work together. The final stage in the development of the group takes place when the group is able to autonomously take responsibility for its actions. Given a task, they set out to achieve it with minimum fuss and maximum efficiency, with little time lost in members getting distracted. Such a group tends to arrange itself in a manner where all members can participate (circular seating), divides responsibilities by consensus, individuals help each other and there is an overall sense of ownership. This stage has been called the Stage of Performing. For facilitators it is essential to make out where the participants are in terms of group development and then they can assist the process. In the initial stages some individuals tend to behave in certain set ways lik e - Module 4 179being aggressive and challenging the facilitator, resisting, continuously trying to draw attention of the facilitator to herself/himself, and so on. The facilitator must be able to recognise this kind of behaviour. This kind of behaviour is usually a resistance to the facilitator authority, or geared to getting recognition within the group. The facilitator must accordingly try to talk to the person outside sessions and win their trust. The important thing is to realise that these kinds of behaviour have the potential to disrupt the proceedings of the training, and then there is the potential of akward showdowns. These should be avoided as far as possible. Cultural programmes can assist in speeding up the development of groups. Logistics In a participatory training or training it is always a good idea to encourage participants to share in the arrangements. This makes the participants directly responsible for their own learning as well as share in the overall conducting of the training. Some things that the participants can be made responsible for is Maintaining the time schedule Checking arrangements regarding food and board Daily reporting Keeping a pulse on the learning processes - is everyone being included, are the topics being discussed in a manner that every one is able to understand and so on. These responsibilities can be shared by a larger group of participants by constituting daily task groups on a rotating membership basis. Post-training follow-up Trainings like these are essentially meant to reflect in the changed behaviour of the participants and not just a change in their knowledge level. It is always interesting for the facilitator to know if the participants have indeed brought about some changes in their own behaviour. This is easier said than done, but it may be possible if the participants are provided an opportunity to plan for some specific changes and then the facilitators can informally or formally follow up on these plans through a letter if not anything else. Facilitators can also leave their contact information with participants for them to get in touch in case of any doubts later on. Ideally trainings like these should have follow-up trainings but that may be difficult within the present framework of RCH trainings.

Methodology Input, exercise, analysis and discussions. Duration 75 minutes Link with the previous units This is the last module of the MNGO manual. In the previous five modules we discussed Perspective building of RCH, Baseline survey, MCH and ASRH, Adult learning Principles and training methods. We now move on to actual project design, planning and budgeting of MNGO/FNGO project proposals. In this unit we shall be discussing the process of planning for change. Training aids Written instruction for the group exercise, chart paper, exercise materials. Hand out Copy of the power point presentation. Notes for the facilitator Help the participants to visualize themselves as FNGO and MNGO. Need for partnership and shared understanding between MNGO and FNGO should come clearly. What kind of changes can the FNGO-MNGO team bring about through their work in their respective community? What kind of negotiation can they do with the district administration for providing service delivery? What kind of facilitation MNGO will do for FNGO to use planning as a tool for Planning for ChangeUnit 6.1203 Module 6delivering RCH services in this context. What kind of preparation MNGO will do in this context as a partner in the planning process? Steps Input (10 minutes) The facilitator provides an overview of planning and the importance of leadership for planning in the NGO context. Exercise ( 35 minutes). Proposed game: Hollow Square. The purpose of the exercise is to help participants to realize the importance of planning, consultation, prioritization, identification and utilization of e xternal and internal resources, and completing the task. (Facilitator to give written instruction for the exercise) Method Form the participants into three groups as planners, builders and observers. Give them the instruction sheet and announce the time. Task The group has to complete the formation of the square. On completion of the exercise, each group to make presentation on the process adopted, challenges they had, and what worked better due to planning. Plenary analysis (20 minutes). Groups make presentation and the rest observe and others critique the same. Summary by facilitator (10 minutes) There are several variations of this game. They are known as Cooperative Square, broken square etc. The importance is not in completing the square but in the methodology adopted to do the same. Please refer to the handout for instructions.Manual for MNGOs 204The hollow Square. Purpose T o provide an experience and find out how difficult it is to plan work to be carried out by others and to carry out work by others. T o both understand and give reasons for resentment and resistance of people when they are told to do something which they had no part in planning T o understand the dynamics of helpful and hindering kind of communication between those who plan or assign work and those who carry out work. Time required 30 minutes to play and 30 minutes for analysis. Planners Duration: 25 minutes Each of you will be given an envelope containing 4 pieces of the puzzle, which, when correctly assembled with the 12 pieces held by the other members of your team will make a HOLLOW SQUARE design. Your task will be 1. Plan (but not carry out) how the 16 pieces of the puzzle, distributed among your team members should be correctly assembled to make a design 2. When the building team arrives, instruct them on how best to assemble the puzzle pieces. You may begin to instruct them at any time during the 25 minutes time period fixed but not later than 5 minutes before they are to begin the assembly pieces. General rules for you to follow 1. You must keep all the 4 pieces you have before you at all times while you plan and instruct. However you must not attempt to make the hollow square. 2. You must not touch or trade pieces of your team during the planning or instruction period. 3. You must not show the key at any time to the building team 4. You must not attempt to make any part of the design yourself 5. Members of the building team working with you must observe rule no. 2 above. 6. When the time is announced for the building teams to begin assembling the pieces, you must not give any further instructions. You may only observe what happens.Instructions for Hollow Square GameHandout 205 Module 6Observers You will be observing a situation in which the planning team decides how to solve a problem and give instructions to the building team on how to implement their plan. The problem consists of trying to understand and carry out the best plan for assembling the 16 pieces of a puzzle into the form of a hollow square, all within a time limit. The planning team is supplied with a sample set of pieces, a pattern sheet and key sheet to study and make their plans, but is not permitted to attempt assembly of the pieces. You will remain a silent observer during the entire process i.e. through the planning, the instruction and the assembly periods. Rules 1. Do not touch 2. Do not speak 3. Watch the general pattern of the communication and watch any one member of the planning team during planning and instructing periods any one member of the building during the assembly time. 4. During the planning period check: a. Is there balanced participation among the planning team? b. What behaviours are blocking or facilitating the planning process c. How does the planning team divide the time between planning and instructions? 5. During the instruction period check: a. Which member of the planning team gives instructions? How is this decided? b. What strategy is applied in orienting the building team to the task? c. What assumptions made by the planning team are not communicated to the building team? d. How effective are the instructions? e. Does the Building team appear to be feel free to ask questions? 6. During the assembly period watch for the following: a. What is the evidence that the building team members clearly understand or misunderstand the instructions? b. What non-verbal reactions do the Planning team members exhibit as they watch their plans being implemented or ruined? Builders You are to carry out the task according to the instructions given by the Planning team It may call you in for instructions at any time. If you are not called, you are to report anyway, twenty minutes from the precise time when your task is scheduled to begin. Thereafter no further instructions will be given to your planning team.Manual for MNGOs 206While you are awaiting the complete the assigned task as quickly as possible While you are awaiting the call from the planning team, you may discuss and make notes on the following: 1. What are your feelings and concerns while awaiting instructions to carry out an unknown task? 2. How could the 4 members of your team best organize yourselves to work together? The notes that you make on these two questions could be helpful during the discussion that will follow the implementation period.207 Module 6Objective T o enable participants to understand the issues in the context of FNGO - MNGOs, related to data collection, analysis and using data for project planning Outcome Participants will be able to understand the need for data collection, sources, inter relationship of data - comprehending data for project formulation, choosing appropriate data, relating local issues to broader district and state issues through data analysis and using the same in project proposal development. Methodology Input, group exercises for data analysis and plenary discussions Duration 120 minutes Link with the previous unit After getting your team ready to work on project development, we now need to look at the available data, interpret and analyze the same. This step will enable participants to identify the gaps and accordingly plan interventions. Training aids District household survey data, SRS, NFHS data and form 6 (a monthly form filled by ANM sent to PHC/DHO) filled base line formats, FGD information. Hand out Causal Pathway- diagram, district data sheet Notes for the Facilitator Keep copies of district household survey data from the respective districts. Use causal pathway diagram to emphasize on the importance of understanding the root cause of an issue e.g, malnutrition. Discuss with participants about reading and analyzing data. Give local simple examples. Get the participants to think on other complementing information that an FNGO will require make effective use of this data. Explain the role that MNGOs have in analysis and sharing of baseline findings, FGD and key informant interview results with FNGOs.Unit 6.2 Understanding Data, Data Analysis and InterpretationManual for MNGOs 208Steps Input (15 minutes) Understanding basic data, distinction between data and information, sources of data and how to make data people friendly, how to make the data live? How can provision of data enhance community ownership of the process? Group work (30 minutes) Method Form the participants into 4 groups. Ensure distribution of core and the guest trainers in these groups. Provide each group with the latest district household survey data from their respective state. Focus on two districts with poor RCH record. Task Each group to understand the over all picture in that district and also analyze maternal health, child health, adolescent reproductive health and other RCH issues respectively. Plenary presentation (40 minutes) After internal discussion, each group to present their core issue in that particular aspect and justify their selection of the core issue. In other words, the core intervention they would undertake if they were the FNGO in that area. The rest of the participants to observe and give feedback or comment, question the rationale. Input: Facilitator's analysis (35 minutes) Input on the group work leading to causal pathway analyses.209 Module 6Causal Pathway Diagram Insufficient health services and unhealthy Insufficient access to food Malnutrition and death health services and unhealthy Inadequate care for mothers and children Potential resources Economic Structure Political and ideological superstructure Inadequate education Disease Inadequate dietary Source: Adapted from UNICEF , (Bellamy, 1998) Formal and Outcome Immediate causesImmediate causes Basic causesBasic causesUnderlying causesUnderlying causes Causes of malnutrition Handout Manual for MNGOs 210Objective T o enhance participants understanding of the different steps in writing a FNGO project proposal. Outcome Participants will be able to develop an FNGO proposal based on the analysis of the given case studies. Methodology Input , group work-Case analysis and presentation and filling up of FNGO format up to worksheet 4 (Background information, community and project area, situational analysis, identification of core issues and prioritization, setting project goals, objectives and activities). Duration 210 minutes Link with the previous unit After the exercise on data analysis in unit 6.2, participants are now familiar with the variations in performance of indicators in different districts. In the case studies, we take the participants a step further so that they can comprehend and relate many of the reasons identified for poor performance to situations existing in the case study. These case studies when analyzed carefully will help them to identify key areas for RCH interventions and develop goals, objectives, indicators, strategies and activities. A series of worksheets will also be given to the participants for actually carrying out the exercise in a classroom setting. Training aids Case studies, worksheets 1-4 for each member of the team, markers, chart paper, LCD. Note for facilitator Ensure that all the case studies, worksheets are available for each participant irrespective of the groups they work in. Explain the methodology to be adopted for analyzing the cases as well as the steps to be followed in filing the FNGO format. Linkages with the BLS, data analyses are to be established by reminding the participants and asking questions.FNGO Proposal DevelopmentUnit 6.3211 Module 6The cases at the end of the unit are only samples facilitating learning in the class room/training session. Each RRC need to remember that the MNGO conte xt varies in each state and within each district. While training the MNGOs, ensure that, RRCs use the format of the given cases but develop cases relevant to MNGO context in their respective places. Steps 1. Input (20 minutes) Give a clear overview of purpose of developing FNGO proposal and the need to do it in steps. Recall the key learning from the field visit for conducting BLS and FGD, link it to learning on RCH and data analysis and planning. 2. RRC wise group work (40 minutes) Task : Divide the participants into three groups by clubbing the RRCs. And distribute the prepared case studies1. Give clear written instructions for the case analysis. Groups to identify the core issue to be addressed, what kind of goal they will set and proposed interventions. 3. Method Plenary presentations on group work - 45 minutes (7-10 minutes each): Identified presenters from each group will make presentations. The others will critique the same. 4. Input (15 minutes) synthesis of the presentation. 5. Filling the FNGO proposal format: RRC wise group work: ( 30 minutes) Distribute the FNGO proposal format - worksheet number 1-2. Explain each worksheet. The 3 groups formed earlier continue to work together to fill the FNGO proposal format, based on their analysis of the case, available background information - up-to worksheet Number 2. 1The three case studies can be found at the end of the moduleManual for MNGOs 2126. Filling of FNGO format continued by groups 6.1 Distribute worksheet 3. Participants to work on worksheet 3 -Identification of core issue-(from the case study data)-20 minutes. 6.2 Presentation by groups on Core issue -Discussion and clarification (20 minutes) 7. Distribute worksheet number 4 Participants to work in their groups on setting goals, objectives and core activities. Use the case study data). ( 20 minutes) 7.1 Presentation by groups on Goals, objectives and interventions/activities (20 minutes) 8. Synthesis by the facilitator (10 minutes) For the facilitator Participants may not be able to complete the task within the session. If so, do not rush them. Ensure that each step is well understood by the participants before moving on to the next. It would be helpful to develop a template for each case (MH, Child health and FP), based on the group presentations. Summarize day's proceedings (15 minutes). Evening task It is important that the groups continue to work and complete up to worksheet 4 in the night and start breaking the large heads into probable activities for making budget, the next day. For example, capacity building needs to further broken by category-wise training, participants and number of training; exposure visits, sharing of experience etc. This work is crucial to understand the budget session on the following day. Important note It is critical that the steps given above are followed for developing FNGO proposal. Participants are facilitated to fill the five worksheets, which put together will give the completed FNGO proposal. Do not make them write the proposal in one go. 213 Module 6Work Sheet 1.

Block information Brief block level health information obtained through secondary data. Do not give very detailed information. Can put annexure for details. Give a few sentences reflecting the critical health data contributing to the status of underserved and unserved area.FNGO Sample Proposal Format HandoutManual for MNGOs 2142.2. Demographic profile of the population proposed to be covered (base line survey could give this data ). Make a table with information on total population, differentiated as male, female, adolescent boys and girls, children under 3 and under 6, literacy rate, female-headed households, average family size (give it in the form of a table). This information is critical because from the demographic profile you can develop indicators on: sex ratio below and above six, proportion of children to adults, children per family, dependency ration, women headed HH, number of eligible couples, female literacy and overall literacy rates. 2.3. Is the chosen project area an underserved or unserved area? What criteria were used to decide the chosen area as underserved or unserved area and by whom? 2.4. Community profile Provide in the form of a table, information on: What services are available and who are the providers? What resources are available within the community in terms of TBA, AWW , and trained community health volunteers, other NGOs, panchayat health committees etc. Provide a remark column in the table and mention whether each category is active or not. 215 Module 6Situational analysis: (one page) This section will in detail inform the situation in the chosen areas including existing situation, perceptions and practices that contribute to the situation; and detail what services are available from the government system or private providers, gaps. T owards this it is essential to understand the available data from the various sources. Each source has a specific purpose and contributes to strengthening your proposal. Do use all the sources. Information from these sources would help you to establish the authenticity of your information and help you mak e interventions more focused. a)Sources of primary data : Baseline survey, FGD, key health informant interviews-MO-PHC, ANM, AWW , TBA, discussion with block health officials. For example , if you were collecting information FP and unmet needs, the baseline survey would provide data on number of eligible couple per 1000 baseline survey would provide data on number of eligible couple per 1000 baseline survey population; CPR, method specific rates, type contraceptives used, age at marriage etc. This will be complemented through FGD , which will bring out the perceptions and existing health practices in the community. For examples, son preference, religious believes or sanctions, fear of health implications if men get sterilized, social strictures leading to early marriage of girls, non-availability of counselling, attitude of the service providers etc. The key health informant interviews with ANM could complement this further key health informant interviews with ANM could complement this further key health informant interviews with ANM by giving an insight about services that are well accepted in the community and also an insight into those that resisted and reasons for such resistance, or information on the quality and reliability of the supply system contributing to the status related to unmet needs. Interview with elderly women or TBAs could give perspectives on delivery practices. Key health informant interview with the MO-PHC could give you information on what support services and products the local health system can provide in your project area-for example,FNGO Proposal - Worksheet 2 Manual for MNGOs 216 From where the supplies can be procured and What records need to be kept and reported Where to refer in the event of serious side effect What kinds of health camps are held and how FNGO can participate or conduct the same? (This information is critical for FNGO in-order to optimally use the available budget) b)Sources records of panchayat, ANM and AWW registers/ records/reports (This will back up your information from the primary sources) For example, ANM and AWW records will provide - eligible couple numbers, current contraceptive prevalence rate, methods used, and parity thus helping to revalidate the data generated from the base line. Rationale for selection of interventions : All the above (demographic data, health information, community profile and situation analysis etc) along with the expertise and past experience of the FNGO will inform the rationale for FNGO involvement in the chosen area for RCH service delivery (E.G: Strong organizational capacity with permanent staff, community presence and credibility or past experience in addressing women's health issues particularly related to pregnancy and childbirth and good rapport with the local health/Panchayat system).217 Module 6 FNGO Proposal - Worksheet 3. Identification of core issues -problem statement: From the situational analysis identify the core problem and the related peripheral issues. For example, situational analysis data reveals that there is an increasing number of female sterilization, increasing number of girls under 16 getting married, no concept of spacing, and there is a shortage in contraceptive supplies - what could be the core issue here? The magnitude of the problem, reasons for the existence of the problem, some of the factors which act as barriers and that aggravates will determine the core problem. You may have a number of issues. Prioritise the critical issues. FNGO cannot do everything. This will depend on FNGO capacity to address the issue. The health system may have another priority. The community may have suggested a priority area. Start with an acceptable solution in the sense to the community which is doable by the system, FNGO and supported by MNGO. For example, if the community has 56 % of the girls getting married before the age of 18 years, there is a social compulsion to deliver the first baby within the first year. What can be the possible intervention by the FNGO? There are the options of delaying marriage, vis a vis delaying first pregnancy vis-a-vis delaying the inter pregnancy interval. FNGO may not have any control over the first two, while it has an opportunity to work on delaying interval between pregnancies. Manual for MNGOs 218FNGO Proposal - Worksheet 4 Goal, Objectives, Activities and Indicators Goal statement This statement should be only one sentence. Do not club too many ideas. It will be a statement developed in such a way that it reflects the long-term goal. It may not be achieved during the project period. Objectives What do you propose to achieve during the project period? Keep the number of objectives limited to two or maximum of three. Make the objectives \"SMART\" (S: Specific, M: Measurable, A: Achievable, R: Reliable, T: Time-bound) There is a tendency to write one or two objective and a long list of sub- objectives. This is not required. Just write the two or three major objectives. Strategies Strategies tell you in broad terms (e.g.: capacity building) 'how ' an issue will to be addressed or approached. Each strategy will be addressed by taking up several activities. Interventions/Activities Under each strategy give the list of activities. This is important for calculating costs under each head. Indicators All the above should lead to achieving the BLS and process indicators set in the process, facilitating the measurement of the effectiveness of the interventions. For making it easy to read, provide the list of activities, input, expected output and verifiable indicators in the form of table. Provide a list of manpower requirement.219 Module 6FNGO Proposal: Worksheet 5 Monitoring, Budget and Time Line 5.1. Monitoring how the project proposes to monitor the financial and programme progress? Provide a brief plan. Write briefly: What kind of community system you will establish to include the community in monitoring the progress of the project? How will you provide feedback to community and receive feedback from the community? What support you will take from the local health system and from the MNGO? 5.2. Budget provide a three year budget with clear budget heads and their break up. 5.3. Time line Provide a complete plan of action with time line for the first year . And a tentative plan for year 2and 3. (Please see the samples of FNGO proposals given as Handout 2 of Unit 6.4)Manual for MNGOs 220Case studies Case study 1: Child Health Introduction to case study for project design Hardwar has six administrative blocks - Bhagwanpur, Roorkee, Khanpur, Narsen, Lakshar and Bhadrabad. 2002 in Khandpur , Lakshar blocks, while in Roorkee and Bhadrabad it was established in 1996 and in Narsen and Bhagwanpur it has been functioning for over 10 years. It is the most populous district of Uttaranchal and is also an important pilgrimage destination due to the presence of the river Ganga, as she flows downstream on her way to Allahabad in Uttar Pradesh. The presence of the river and the canal systems has given rise to large scale farming throughout the district. The mapping of unserved and underserved areas in Hardwar district was carried out in 2002 by Hardwar-based NGO, Mahila Aur Shisu Kalyan, selected under the MNGO scheme. They identified 15 villages in Block Bhagwanpur , 25 villages in Block Lakshar and 22 villages of Block Khanpur as unserved and underserved areas. Findings revealed that there were negligible health services being provided to the people as: The sub-centre buildings were in a dilapidated condition and located away from the villages. The ANMs could not stay in the sub-centres, as the buildings were dilapidated, located in isolated areas and far away from the main road. They came to the roadside village and told the women from these villages to come to the Anganwadi centre on a fixed day of the month for their ANC checkup. However, very few women come to the centre to get TT or the iron tablets. The ANMs also said that as there was no primary school within a radius of 5-6 kilometres, they were compelled to keep their families at the block level. The MOs are supposed to serve the villages. The posts of MOs of PHCs are also lying vacant. Shortage of Medical Officers was the answer given to the survey team. It was also found that on polio plus immunization days, the ANMs and LHVs were given vehicles to cover these villages and that the polio coverage in these villages was satisfactory. The State Government is keen to involve MNGOs/field NGOs for working in these unserved and underserved areas and has held preliminary meetings with them. Bal Gopal Ashram, an FNGO is situated in Bhagwanpur block, has been working in this block for the last five years in child caring and education projects. This block adjoins Dehradun, but is perhaps the least developed of all blocks in Handout 1221 Module 6Hardwar. There are several rain-fed rivers criss crossing the entire block, thus making it difficult to access villages during the rainy season. F orest cover is quite extensive. Village T elpura and Bhanwala are two of the 15 villages identified under Block Bhgwanpur as being unserved. For reaching the block headquarters, they have to walk on foot to the roadside village (3-4 kilometres) and hire the occasional public transport for going to the block. P eople move on foot from one village to the other. Recently, the FNGO carried out a survey of the two identified villages the data for which is presented below: The General Household survey data of these two villages: Population - 10,413 persons Eligible couples - 1770 Number of households was 2156. Average family size is 4-6 among Hindus and 5-8 among the Muslim population. Sex ratio is 1000 males to 960 females Majority (69.4 %) people belong to the Muslim community Remaining (30.6 %) are Hindus belonging to schedule castes. Occupation includes collecting forest produce: honey, wild grass for rope making, herbs (43.0%), carpentry (23%), daily labour (20.4%) in stone crusher and seasonal cane crushers, farming (13.6%). No primary school up to 5 km and only few upper caste girls have studied up to class 5. In most households, girls help their mothers with the household chores, work in the fields and accompany them to the forest or look after the younger siblings. Boys too are apprentice at a very young age of 10-11 to a barber, carpenter, or work in stone quarries, jaggery units or cane crushers - anything that will fetch money into the household. Pregnancy and outcome-related data over previous one year 1. T otal Pregnancies - 212, abortions - 15 2. ANC - only 76 women (2 TT and getting 100 tablets of iron and folic acid tablets). 3. Pregnancy-related complications - 32 cases (anaemia, swelling of face and feet, bleeding after delivery, malpresentation, obstructed labour) 4. Attendance during delivery--Dai-58%, relative/self 22% and skilled birth attendant - 20% 5. Pregnancy Outcome: T otal live births - 191, still births - 12, Deaths within first week of birth - 22 Neonatal deaths within the first 28 days of birth - 23 Infant death - 32 Community perceptions/practicesManual for MNGOs 222During antenatal, natal and post-natal care Many did not know about the need for T etanus toxoid or iron tablets Consume less food during pregnancy so that the baby would be small and easy to deliver. Ate only two meals and it was limited to consumption of rice or wheat base cereal, some vegetables. There was no time for any rest during the day. The women believed that the harder one worked during pregnancy, the shorter the duration of labour. Delivery by Dai or relative Corner of the house is selected for delivery and it is usually on the floor T o hasten the process, dai uses oil over the abdomen and also irons out the vagina so that passage is smooth Sometimes pressure is also applied to push the baby Dai holds the baby as soon as head come out. Clean the baby and massage of the child with oil, Another dai is called for cutting the chord and sometimes if the family is willing to pay, the quack is called for giving an injection for quick delivery of the placenta. Baby is given a bath Dais use a clean blade for cord cutting, clean cord washed in warm water is also used to tie the cord. Post-natal customs Religious customs are followed and the mother is given meal only after 6 days. Till then she is given only roti and watery roti and watery roti dal Feeding practices and customs It was customary to give prelacteal feeds to babies, Colustrum was disposed off with and considered bad. Some who had visited the hospital for delivery or Antenatal care gave the baby colustrum Others had initiated bottle-feeding after 3 months as they found it more convenient for the older child to feed the baby in their absence. About stillbirth and neonatal death in the community According to them child can be defined as \"when child cannot speak, walk and brain is not fully developed, they are child.\" One should take care of the child till five years of age, as it is the most crucial period. Most of the infant death occurs within two or three days after birth in their region. Most of these deaths are said to be due to wrath of evil spirits. Even the main causes of stillbirth are said to be the wrath of evil spirits. Some of them also shared that stillbirth is due to accident in the most 223 Module 6advance stage of pregnancy. Some considered first six months periods as the most crucial. Decision-making Mother-in-law, mother, husband mainly takes the decision. Some of the mothers are aware and they can take decision but they are dependent on them (husband/elders) for money. They do not seek permission of elders in case of minor ailments but they definitely seek permission of in-laws and husband in case of serious illness like ARI, cold & cough, etc. They go to hospital in case of serious conditions like pain in abdomen, lower abdomen pain, and white discharge. Guiding questions for all the three case analysis: When answered, these answers would give input for the proposal. 1. What goals, objectives can be set by the FNGO for itself over the next three years? 2. What strategies, activities are possible to achieve these objectives? 3. What can the FNGO do to improve existing government services, including quality? 4. What services can FNGO negotiate with surrounding private providers? 5. What community actions can FNGO facilitate to ensure that all mothers have access to QUALITY services? 6. Which community stakeholders will FNGO need to enlist to ensure an effective intervention in their individual case? 7. What linkages will FNGO develop for referrals? 8. How will referral transport be organized and how will it be financed? 9. What is the staffing structure that FNGO would require to accomplish this? 10. What is the training strategy? 11. What critical data would JSS gather for ongoing programme monitoring?

The State Government is keen to involve MNGOs/ field NGOs for working in these unserved and underserved areas and has held preliminary meetings with them. 225 Module 6Areas of Lakshar block have suffered from floodwaters due to either low embankments, or low-lying areas around the river. This has resulted in leeching of the topsoil in portions of the block, villages being cut-off from the main road during rains, thus making access very difficult for the rural population and to service providers. An alternative source of employment for poor rural families' resident here is transportation of stones from the riverbed to the stone crushing units. The fine sand from the stone crushing units also adds to the poor soil conditions Parivar Sahayog is located in Lakhsar block of Hardwar. Their area of coverage is 20,000 population of this block, spread across 7 villages. It has been involved in forestry and watershed programmes. It has also supported the formation of Self Help groups around micro finance. Increasingly they have realized that women's health issues are an area that must be addressed. Over the last three years they have been conducting health education on a range of health issues with SHG groups, including family planning ad maternal health. They have two health volunteers in the team and a doctor from the PHC acts as a resource person in the health education programmes periodically . For FP services the communities have relied primarily on the government sector . Contraceptive usage Service providers for FP in Lakhsar block are the government ANMs. Through FGDs, PS has identified that the service the ANM provides is very irregular . Only in March, the ANM is seen more regularly to escort women to the block PHC for sterilization operations. As the targets are no longer in place, her visits are few and far between. She also carries condoms and pills (and the ICDS centre and the local pan shop also stock them). However, there is no effort at increasing community knowledge on these methods. Experiences with IUD in the villages are limited, mainly because of side effects experienced by a few women. FGDs with young men demonstrate that they need to travel to the block headquarters to procure condoms since there is little anonymity in their own village. However there appears to be a need among young couples to use temporary methods. The quantitative data in the baseline showed the following: At the time of the survey, 249 women were using a modern FP method Distribution of women showing use of different FP methods FP Methods No women Percentage Sterilization 150 60.2 Condoms 61 24.5 Cu-T 22 8.8 Oral Pills 16 6.5 T otal 249 100 Manual for MNGOs 226Source of availability of FP methods (condoms, oral pills) among women users Source No Percentage ANM 60 Block hospital 24 Panwalla 65 ICDS Centre 100 249 Interviews were held with more women from the community with a view to calculate the unmet need for family planning Table below gives the UNMET NEED in these villages No Percentage No of women studied 575 Unmet need for permanent methods No of women not desiring any more child (sum total of a+b+c)173 30.08 a) Women having more than 2 children 120 20.86 b) Women with 2 children 41 7.1 c) Women with less than 2 children 12 2.09 Unmet need for spacing method Have no desire for any child for next 2 years 67 11.6 T otal unmet need 240 41.6 Guiding questions for all the three case analysis: When answered, these answers would give input for the proposal. 1.

It was also found that on polio plus immunization days, the ANMs and LHVs were given vehicles to cover these villages and that the polio coverage in these villages was satisfactory. The State Government is keen to involve MNGOs/field NGOs for working in these unserved and underserved areas and has held preliminary meetings with them. Areas of Khandpur block, like Lakhsar have suffered from flood waters due to either low embankments, or low-lying areas around the river. This has resulted in leeching of the topsoil in portions of the block, villages being cut- off from the Manual for MNGOs 228main road during rains thus making access very difficult for the rural population and to service providers. An alternative source of employment for poor rural families' resident here is transportation of stones from the riverbed to the stone crushing units. The fine sand from the stone crushing units also adds to the poor soil conditions. Jan Suraksha Sanstha (JSS) is an FNGO in Khanpur block of Hardwar district. Their field area of operation covers a population of 25,000, covering 22 villages. JSS has been working in the area of community development related to primacy education, health awareness and sanitation for the last ten years. R eproductive and child health is a relatively new intervention. There are three sub-centres in its field area where JSS works. The nearest PHC is the block PHC, which is about 22 kms away. Given the terrain, it takes almost three hours to reach the PHC from the field site. The furthest sub-centre from any village is about 5 kms. Of the 3 sub-centres, only one and its surrounding roadside villages are regularly visited by an ANM (weekly). She provides immunization, antenatal check up (only abdominal examination, no BP , urine or Hb test), and FP advice, supplies of pills and condoms. FP health education is not provided in any sub-centre. The other two sub- centres have an ANM posted but the sub-centre functioning is erratic and the ANMs follow their own schedule, and most often the community is not aware of their schedule. The block PHC has one medical officer who comes in the morning and returns to the town late afternoon. One ANM and one LHV are resident at the block PHC. They do not provide institutional delivery services, preferring to go to people's homes and conduct deliveries and accept informal payment. The community is predominantly tribal, resettled in Hardwar's Lakhsar Block from villages surrounding the T ehri Dam area as part of the resettlement programme. They have their own medicinal remedies. Traditionally relatives who also double up as birth attendants conduct deliveries. However there is a growing use of ANM/nurse to conduct deliveries but primarily by the more affluent. Female literacy in the area is low at 22% and male literacy at 45%. With the increasing access to elementary education and non- formal education, younger girls do go to school. Men often migrate to Hardwar block during the tourist season in search of work. Some have also got jobs as contractual labour at the Dam site. They have small land holdings, which the women tend in the absence of their men. JSS has conducted a household level baseline survey focusing on RCH information. In addition they also conducted a series of FGD among women, man and youth, and key informant interviews with the ANM, TBA, Anganwadi worker, and community health volunteer of another community-based organization. 229 Module 6Key findings from the survey (and corresponding district data) are: Lakhsar blockHardwar district Percentage of women receiving complete ANC 19% 28.4% Proportion of girls married below 18 years 55% 58% Percentage institutional deliveries 10% 33% Percentage deliveries conducted by skilled attendants 10 % 31% FGDs reveal that awareness of the need for ANC was low. Most women felt TT was important (and knew that two doses were required), but were not clear on other components of antenatal check up. Most deliveries are conducted by traditional birth attendants, but in some place among the richer tribals, the ANM/ LHV was called. In case of emergency, families took the pregnant women to the district hospital, which was eight hours away. There is also a private nursing home in the block headquarters, but most families cannot afford that cost. In depth questioning revealed that in the last year, three women had to be taken by tractor to the district hospital. One woman died en route. Her child died three days later. Of the other two, one lost her baby and the other (after four months) was still bedridden as a result of the severe bleeding. When asked if women would go to an institution for a normal delivery, the answer was that they did not like the cleanliness of the facility and the attitude of the staff. Guiding questions for all the three case analysis: When answered, these answers would give input for the proposal. 1. What goals, objectives can be set by the FNGO for itself over the next three years? 2. What strategies, activities are possible to achieve these objectives? 3.

Financial or quantitative statement prepared prior to a defined period of time of the policies and practices to be followed during that definite period of time and implementation of these policies for the attainment of given objectives. Financial Budget Quantifying resources needed to achieve objectives Both MNGOs & FNGOs should identify resources that are existing, own and available with district (e.g: technical, manpower, space, supplies) Advantages of a Budget Budgets are used for the following purposes: Help implementing objectives; for calculating estimated Income and Expenditure Coordinate activities, develop communicate plans, motivate staff by setting clear targets and monitoring and evaluating actual performance Budgeting Involves Three stages: Planning (setting objectives, seeking funds), Monitoring - Measuring how actual I & E relates to planned I & E - Variances; and Evaluating - how closely objectives have been achieved Stages in Planning a Budget Identify project objectives (Involve a range of staff within the organisation) Identify the 'Limiting Factor'- could be lack of money, human or other resources or competence - (take into a/c during planning process. Gather data from previous year's information, estimates from supplied; From Baseline & reports received of ANM & Panchayats From interventions Determine receivable amounts Determine the amount to be spent (Be realistic with estimation) Construct the Budget Keep notes of all calculations Ensure figures based on authentic data e.g. incase of travel - distance, mode of transport; population; interventions etc. What activities are included in the 20 % administrative cost (MNGO) Personnel, Support Services and Supervisory services. Support Services Capacity building of FNGOs, technical support to FNGOs, liaise, network and coordinate with State & district & PRI, linkages with other NGOs, work closely with RRCs and State NGO Coordinators and provide IEC materialsManual for MNGOs 236Supervisory Activities (MNGOs) Monitor Performance of FNGOs, both programme and financial While collecting data for your budgets, understand own NGO's needs, and their capacity. Forget Me Nots While making a budget, don't forget the following: Ground Realities: This needs to address the population that the institution is serving, its location and the nature of activity or intervention - e.g. Healthcare for Mothers & Children - Population - Pregnant mothers (Pregnancy-related complications, Transport cost for obstetric emergency etc.) Inflation: When budgeting for one year, remember that prices will go up gradually over the year. When budgeting for more than one year, provide for next year's inflation also. Budgetary Control Stages in monitoring a budget Monitor the income and expenditure regularly here quarterly and take action. How to Monitor Prepare a budget variance analysis T ake action : Invoice not processed for an item received, Timing difference - Activity happening and division of budget over a wider period Payment in advance for goods not received Take Action T ake no action if the actual income or expenditure is temporarily incorrect - it will correct itself Predict what will happen if the current trend continues T ake action to ensure that an income or expenditure item reverts to what was expected e.g. cut back on planned programme, follow up on grants not received Monitor the budget and ensure that every action has been effective237 Module 6(This analysis does not cover worksheet 1 and 2 of the FNGO proposal) it begins from worksheet 3).

Outcome Participants have a clear understanding of the monitoring process and the relevant instruments that facilitate monitoring. Methodology Lecture discussion followed by group work and individual group presentation Duration 120 min Link with previous session Project design is incomplete without a section on monitoring of the activities and indicators. When introducing the topic, link this unit with unit 6.2 on Understanding Data, Data analysis and Interpretation and the Unit on indicators in Module 2. Training aids Written instruction for the group exercise, chart paper, exercise material Handout - Excerpts from the Hands-On Manual for planners and managers, UNFPA, 2004 Notes for the facilitator Help the participants to visualize themselves as MNGOs-FNGOs What do they understand by the term monitoring? What are the different methods that they are familiar with for monitoring projects that they have implemented? What is the importance of establishing a monitoring system? How will MNGOs and FNGOs link with the existing monitoring system at Block and District level? Introduction (30 minutes)MonitoringUnit 6.5 Manual for MNGOs 256 What do we understand by the term 'Monitoring' Gathering continuous information on the performance of project interventions using indicators is termed monitoring. Monitoring1 serves to track changes over time in inputs (for example, the number of condoms purchased), processes (changes in systems) and output (for example, the number of married and unmarried adolescents receiving family planning counselling services). In RCH projects, issues of creating a demand and providing the necessary service delivery need to be addressed. 'Demand' creation is through the behaviour change communication strategy while 'Supply' is primarily through improving service delivery. Monitoring will provide continuous information on both these aspects. Tools for monitoring (a) Service Delivery level Remember that monitoring should be a regular activity and can help identify problems early, so that timely action can be taken. Examples of tools used in routine monitoring at service delivery level are: Monthly reporting format Quarterly progress reports Supervisory field visit Checklist for assessment of clinical standards and procedures Monitoring of training activities - records, reports and observation schedules On-the-job training Regular staff meetings (b) Community level When doing community-based monitoring, members from the community should be involved right from the planning stage. The tools devised should be user-friendly and they should be able to monitor the activities on a day- to-day or monthly basis. For example, with a group of illiterate women, line diagrams or pictures (they should approve the same), colour coding or pebbles of different sizes are put into different bags and counted at the end of the month. These are some tools used by NGOs to gather information from of the month. These are some tools used by NGOs to gather information from the community level. Data/information thus collected is further collated at the project office and discussed at the monthly or Quarterly review meetings. Regular meetings must also be held at community level to help analyze their own data and identify problem areas that the project must address. (Example is: Steady reduction in participation by adolescent girls in the monthly activities organized by the project. Reasons identified by the girls are - parental permission not granted, time not suitable to many, objection by older brother or members of the family, no fixed place for the meeting). 1Chapter 4, How do we implement and monitor SRH?257 Module 6Who can monitor? All programme staff, managers and health facility staff, should be involved in monitoring. They should use their own records and registers. Community women and men should be encouraged to participate and assist in monitoring the project activities. They should be trained in the use of user friendly records prepared under the project. Finance persons should monitor the budget fund allocation against the expenditure statements and provide programme implementers with their feedback on the actual utilization of budget. Preparation of working budget sheets is as important as planning for the strategies and activities. Relate findings to indicators The project team should relate the findings to the indicators (inputs, process and output) so that they can understand the effect the interventions are having in the field. In other words, through the above we can check on what was agreed and reassess the likelihood of reaching targets. Often adjustments need to be made. We can also monitor the efficiency of the programme, by comparing what inputs were required to achieve a certain output, for example, what human, financial and time resources (inputs) are needed to increase the number of FP acceptors (output) in the project area?

Outcome Participants able to understand the key issues in the development of the comprehensive MNGO proposal Methodology Input, and discussions. Duration 60 minutes. Link with the previous units Once the FNGO proposals are ready, the participants will now work on the comprehensive MNGO proposal on the lines as mentioned by the facilitator and finalise the same. Training aids MNGO proposal format - worksheet, MNGO budget instructions. Handout Instructions on budget making, worksheet on MNGO proposal. Notes for the facilitator Keep the power point or key points ready on a chart paper. Ensure that the participants include all key issues made in the three or four different FNGO proposals and mention the role of the MNGO in supporting the FNGOs for achieving the goals and objectives of the projects. Steps Input Significance of developing a comprehensive MNGO proposal ( 10 minutes) Input Critical steps in MNGO budget making and worksheets (40 minutes) (RRCs to continue their work in their groups in the evening) Synthesis by facilitator (10 minutes)MNGO Proposal Development Unit 6.6 Manual for MNGOs 260MNGO Proposal development - Key Issues Why MNGO Proposal Is Critical? The comprehensive proposal is a commitment by the MNGO on behalf of the FNGOs and the community to the district and state health systems. It is not a simple collation of FNGO proposals. MNGO should have a good understanding of the community profile and the issues in the underserved and unserved areas for making a meaningful comprehensive proposal. Executive summary MNGO proposals should have an executive summary as the top sheet. The executive summary helps the district and state health officials to get a clear understanding of the issues, status of service provision in the selected geographic areas, proposed FNGO strategies and rationale for the same with budget at a glance. Listing of Strategies FNGOs may have spelt out several strategies for the same issue. Do not list out every thing. Do select and club them in a meaningful way for presentation as 3-4 bullet points in the proposal. Avoid repetition. Indicators, Monitoring and Communication Present the indicators in a tabular form for clarity. Clearly indicate MNGOs monitoring plan and how MNGO will facilitate FNGO tracking the project progress? What system is established for mid- course corrections? Provide comprehensive information on how MNGO will communicate (provide and receive feedback) with the community, FNGO, PRI, ANM, other NGOs, RRCs and other block and district health officials. Project Management & Evaluation Provide a clear picture on the structure and in-house capacity of the MNGO for FNGO capacity building, facilitating service delivery, dialogue with the local, and district health system, and financial management. A detailed plan for the preparation for mid-term and final evaluation by the government/external agency and mechanisms for sharing the information with FNGOs and the community? MNGO budget and timeline. A comprehensive 3-year budget including the MNGO budget with clear break up of budget lines, FNGO-wise information and details on the budget for the purchase of equipment. Give a detailed timeline for year one and a tentative plan for the year 2 and 3.261 Module 6MNGO composite proposal format (As in the case of FNGO proposal development, for the preparation of a comprehensive MNGO proposal, the participants are required to fill each of the following sections. Put together, the filled sections will become a comprehensive MNGO proposal. The information has to be taken out of FNGO proposals). MNGO Organizational Profile Name of the organization : Address (Street, Dist, State) : Pin Code : Ph & Fax no. (with STD) : E-mail : Name and designation of Chief Functionary: Registration details : Act under which registered : Date of registration : FCRA no.

A detailed annexure with more in-depth information can be provided. Number of underserved and unserved areas as identified by the government and NGO. What criterion has been applied to categorize them as under or unserved areas? Key RCH issues in the district and government and private services (brief). Information on the community, health situation in the FNGO areas and how they contribute to the overall district situation. Executive summary The key issues, and key strategies proposed by the 3 or 4 FNGOs should be provided in the executive summary. The executive summary helps the district and state health officials to get a clear understanding of the issues, status of service provision in the selected geographic areas, proposed FNGO strategies and rationale for the same with budget at a glance. 3. Health goal set by all the FNGOs over the three years, what do they want to achieve. (Please do not give separate goals by FNGO. (club them and provide 2-3 bullets.) 3. 1. Objectives Again combine the objectives and provide only key points. (2-3 only) 3.2. Strategies There will be many strategies to implement the chosen interventions. Do select the key strategies and make a list of 3-4 bullets for each of the interventions. Do avoid repetition. Provide a summary of the manpower plan given by the FNGOs. For anyone who wants to know what the strategies of individual FNGOs are, they can refer to the detailed FNGO proposal that is attached as an anne xure. 3.3. Activities Each FNGO may be implementing two or more interventions e.g. maternal health and FP , only FP , adolescent reproductive health and FP , RTI and adolescent reproductive health, maternal health and institutional delivery , maternal and child health. For implementing the same there will be several strategies. Provide the key strategies. Under each strategy there may be several activities. Give the major activities chosen.263 Module 63.4. Indicators Make a table with the names of the four FNGOs, their chosen area and the key indicators they have set to achieve. 3.5. Management Discuss mechanism by which the whole process will be managed by the MNGO . What kind of organizational structure does the MNGO have? What plans does the MNGO have for in-house capacity enhancement; for financial management; service delivery, supplies and inventory management. What plans does the MNGO have to collaborate with the district RCH society and other government health system to facilitate implementation? 3.6. Monitoring What kind of monitoring plan does the MNGO propose to adopt? What kind of facilitation with the MNGO provide to FNGOs by way of forms, formats, registers etc.? How will MNGO update the baseline data in preparation of mid term evaluation and how will the MNGO guide the FNGOs for mid-course correction? What kind of communication package does the MNGO propose to use to establish contact with the FNGOs, with the district and state RCH society and RRC? 3.7. Evaluation what kind of preparation will the MNGO undertake for a smooth external evaluation conducted by the government? How it will make it useful for the community? What kind of information sharing will be done with the community? 3.8.
