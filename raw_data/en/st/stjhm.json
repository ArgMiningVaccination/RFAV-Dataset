Who was this young man? Where did he come from? Many anthroposophic healing educators consider Kaspar Hauser as a source of inspiration for healing education. Karl K \u00f6nig, a curative educator and a physician from Austria, developed a deep relationship with Kaspar Hauser. K \u00f6nig founded the Camphill Community, where he and his colleagues created schools and adult villages for people with special needs. Many people who work in Camphill C ommunities consider Kaspar Hauser as a spiritual guide for anthroposophic curative education, youth guidance, and social therapy. Karl K \u00f6nig' s deep spiritual relationship with Kaspar Hauser was a guiding force for developing Camphill Communities around the world. Karl K \u00f6nig was also a student of the work of Rudolf Steiner, Anthroposophy. Anthroposophy was a source of inspiration for Karl K \u00f6nig, as well. How Karl K \u00f6nig developed spiritual relationships with Kaspar Hauser is researched. What role Kaspar H auser played in the development of anthroposophic healing education in the twentieth century is studied. How his impulse continues to live today and into the future is explored. Keywords: enigma, impulse, pure, heart 6 Kaspar Hauser as a Spiritual Guide for Anthroposophic Healing Education \"Here rests Kaspar Hauser. The enigma of his time; of unknown birth, of hidden death\" (K\u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 14). The above words are inscribed on Kaspar Hauser's gravestone in Ansbach, Germany. Kaspar Hauser lived in the early nineteenth century in Germany. Although much research has taken place over the last two centuries, his origin is unknown. His birthday continu es to be unknown. His parents are unknown. Who murdered him and who was involved with his murder are unknown. One thing we know is that he died on December 17, 1833. Kaspar Hauser's life and death were an enigma of his time. To this day, his life continues to be an enigma. \"The story of Kaspar Hauser has never ceased to touch human hearts. Year after year, books and pamphlets are written about this unhappy child. . . . Isn' t it strange that such a simple story does not die down \" (K\u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 25)? Many people only consider Kaspar Hauser as someone who lived a unique life in Europe in the nineteenth century. Yet many other people consider Kaspar Hauser, an extraordinary individual who has made a profound impact on human history. Many anthroposophic healing educators worldwide, especially people involved with anthroposophic healing education for people with special needs, consider Kaspar Hauser, a significant individual who brought spiritual impulses to healing education. He is a source of inspiration for the work. In this thesis, I explored why Kaspar Hauser became an important figure in anthroposophic healing education. I studied the biography of Kaspar Hauser, historical events related to Kaspar Hauser, and how Kaspar H auser has been part of the development of 7 anthroposophic healing education. I also studied Rudolf Steiner's work related to the topic of healing education. My central exploration of this thesis was to research how Karl K \u00f6nig, an Austrian physician a nd curative educator in the twentieth century, brought foundational contributions for Kaspar Hauser to become a spiritual guide for anthroposophic healing education. What Kaspar Hauser brought to Karl K \u00f6nig and anthroposophic healing education was tremendous and shaped the unfolding of this impulse even up to the present day. Throughout his adult life, Karl K \u00f6nig studied and lived closely in his heart with the figure of Kaspar Hauser. In 1934, Karl K \u00f6nig stated, \"[ Kaspar Hauser] brings the impulse of curative education into the world\" (as cited by Selg, 2012, p. 32). On the preparatory notes for his talk in 1940, K \u00f6nig wrote \" Kaspar Hauser 1828. The beginning of curative education\" (as cited by Selg, 2012, p. 35). For Karl K \u00f6nig, Kaspar Hauser lived a s a central figure who brought spiritual impulses to anthroposophic healing education. The spiritual impulse Kaspar Hauser contributed to the biography of Karl K \u00f6nig, and the history of the Camphill Community will establish the leading research of this paper. Karl K \u00f6nig further mentioned at a curative education conference in 1948: \" The theme: Kaspar Hauser, because it is connected with everything that lives today as curative education \" (Selg, 2012, pp. 74-75). Karl K \u00f6nig came to recognize Kaspar Hauser as the patron saint of people with special needs (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 29). He continues to live as a central figure for the spiritual impulse of anthroposophic healing education in the twenty- first century. Through my studies of Karl K \u00f6nig and Kaspar Hauser, I have come to recognize Kaspar Hauser as a primary source of inspiration for anthroposophic healing education. People with special needs are connected to Kaspar Hauser. One can have a glimpse of such a connection through a story 8 like A Christmas Story written by Karl K \u00f6nig (1995). I will introduce Karl K \u00f6nig' s story in a later chapter. This research is also a presentation on how I came to recognize Kaspar Hauser as a spiritual guide for anthroposophic healing education. Karl K \u00f6nig said, \"this child Kaspar wanted to bring peace \" (K\u00f6nig, 2012b, p. 84). As a bringer of peace, his task was to bring healing peace to the whole of humanity. I would like to include in this research how Kaspar Hauser has been working on the healing of humanity, as well as being an inspiration for healing education. Karl K \u00f6nig, together with a group of people whom he met and studied with in Vienna , founded the Camphill Community in the twentieth century. In the Camphill Community, those who work for the community work with people with special needs. The Camphill Community is an international movement that has its foundation in Anthroposophy, the work of Rudolf Steiner (Bang, 2010, p. 11). People who live in the Camphill Community live as a community, work with purpose, and take care of one another regardless of abilities. In the last eighty years, over one hundred Camphill Communities in twenty -two countries have been created and serve people with special needs (Camphill Association of North America, n.d.a). Literature Review The enigma of Kaspar Hauser did not end with the death of Kaspar Hauser in 1833. People continued to ask questions about Kaspar Hauser. \"Who was Kaspar Hauser?\" \"What was the purpose of his life on earth?\" Many people researched Kaspar Hauser in the twentieth century. Peter Tradowsky (1980/2012) researched Kaspar Hauser, including studying from viewpoints of Anthroposophy. He wrote a book, Kaspar Hauser: The Struggle for the Spirit . I learned about the biography of Kaspar Hauser, the people who were around Kaspar Hauser, and 9 the circumstances Kaspar Hauser was in. Peter Tradowsky also included what Rudolf Steiner's had said about Kaspar Hauser. Having such a section helped me explore the enigma of this being with the deepest insight. Karl K \u00f6nig studied Kaspar Hauser throughout the time he was involved with healing education. Karl K \u00f6nig (1995) told the deep connection between the people with special needs and Kaspar Hauser in A Christmas Story. Karl K \u00f6nig (1961/2012a) wrote his profound thoughts about the life of Kaspar Hauser in the essay, The Story of Kaspar Hauser . K\u00f6nig' s (2012b) research is also i ncluded in the essay called Thoughts on Kaspar Hauser: Offered as a Kind of Requiem for Dr Ita Wegman. These three writings showed how much Karl K \u00f6nig had occupied himself with studying about Kaspar Hauser. The Story of Kaspar Hauser and Thoughts on Kaspar Hauser: Offered as a Kind of Requiem for Ita Wegman , can be found in Kaspar Hauser and Karl K \u00f6nig, edited by Richard Steel and Peter Selg (2012). The Story of Kaspar Hauser is also included in the book A Christmas Story. K\u00f6nig's research on Kaspar Hauser was deep. His other research about Kaspar Hauser can be found in different parts of other books published by the Karl K \u00f6nig Institute, and unpublished material the Karl K \u00f6nig Institute administers. Richard Steel has worked with people with special needs in Camphill Communities for many years ( Kaspar Hauser Research Circle, n.d.b). Richard Steel and Peter Selg (2012) edited and published Kaspar Hauser and Karl K \u00f6nig. Richard Steel has researched Kaspar Hauser, Karl K\u00f6nig' s connection to Ka spar Hauser, and the role Kaspar Hauser played in the development of the Camphill Community. Together with Richard Steel's research, Peter Selg's research was included in the book. The title of Peter Selg' s research was Karl K \u00f6nig, Ita Wegman and Kaspar Hauser . Peter Selg also researched Karl K \u00f6nig' s connection to Kaspar Hauser and Kaspar 10 Hauser 's contribution to the development of the Camphill Community. Kaspar Hauser and Karl Konig became one of the primary sources of my research. Eckart B \u00f6hme r's (2019) book Kaspar Hauser Child of Europe: An Artistic and Contemplative Approach to an Enduring Enigma included the most current research of Kaspar Hauser in the twenty -first century. Stories of many new developments today, in which Eckart B\u00f6hmer is involved, are described in this book. Karl K\u00f6nig: A Central -European Biography of the Twentieth Century written by Hans M\u00fcller- Wiedemann (1992/1996) , provided deep and comprehensive knowledge of the life of Karl K \u00f6nig. Karl K \u00f6nig was an essentially important figure for the development of anthroposophic curative education and social therapy. The book included a chapter that talked about Karl K \u00f6nig' s relationship with Kaspar Hauser. Carlo Pietzner's (1983) . . . And from the Night, Kaspar was a play written by him. One can read . . . And from the Night, Kaspar in the book Who Was Kaspar Hauser?. The play provided information about Kaspar Hauser' s life. Carlo Pietzner included many examples of what Kaspar Hauser had said and had done. . . . And from the Night, Kaspar opened up much wonder, interest, and love for me to research more about Kaspar Hauser. The descriptions such as Kaspar Hauser's drea ms and his experience at Confirmation helped me develop insights about Kaspar Hauser. Communities for Tomorrow edited by Richard Steel (2010/2011), provided more information about how the being of Kaspar Hauser had lived in the Camphill Community. T he book also provided information about Sergei Prokofieff's insights and viewpoints related to Anthroposophy and anthroposophic healing education. Sergei Prokofieff was a Russian 11 researcher of Anthroposophy. The book is a compilation of the presentations a t the Michaelmas Conference at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, in 2009 (Steel, 2010/2011, p. 9). Kaspar Hauser Speaks for Himself edited by Andrea Damico Gibson (1993) included Kaspar Hauser's own writing which was published by Daumer in 1983, translated into English. Reading Kaspar Hauser's own words gave deep impressions of his being. Terry Boardman's (2006) research was written in his book Kaspar Hauser: Where Did He Come From? His research helped me understand the historical background and the historical developments in the nineteenth and the twentieth century, related to Kaspar Hauser's life and death. Rudolf Steiner's work was central to the understanding of all this r esearch. The anthroposophical view of the human being and the world was essential for this research. Without Anthroposophy, this research would not have been possible. Research Methods As mentioned, I studied literature related to Kaspar Hause r and the connection of his life to anthroposophic healing education. I made three interviews with anthroposophic healing educators. They were all healing educators who were knowledgeable about Kaspar Hauser and understood how Kaspar Hauser had played a role for Karl K \u00f6nig and in the development of anthroposophic healing education. I was part of organizing and participating in a conference that involved Kaspar Hauser research in autumn 2017. The conference was called the Kaspar Hauser Festival (Kasp ar Hauser Festivals, n.d.) . The festival took place in the Camphill Communities in Columbia County, New York. Being part of the festival became the source of my inspiration to write this thesis about Kaspar Hauser. Eckart B \u00f6hmer and Richard Steel were presenters amongst others and were 12 invaluable resources to learn about Kaspar Hauser. Eckart B \u00f6hmer 's presentations at the Kaspar Hauser Festival in autumn 2017 became part of his book Kaspar Hauser Child of Europe: An Artistic and Contemplative Approach to an Enduring Enigma. I derived further information about Kaspar Hauser from other presentations at the conferences. We, who were involved with the organization of the festivals, studied Kaspar Hauser in preparation. I was also part of organizing and parti cipating in the second Kaspar Hauser Festival in Columbia County, New York in autumn 2019. I developed further and deeper understanding about Kaspar Hauser through being part of the festival. As a research method, my studies included researching historica l developments related to the life of Kaspar Hauser and the development of anthroposophic healing education. I studied the historical backgrounds of the different times when the impulses of healing education emerged in the world. I studied the history when Kaspar Hauser appeared, when Rudolf Steiner (1972/1998) brought Anthroposophy and gave The Curative Education Course , when Karl K \u00f6nig founded the Camphill Community, and some relevant aspects of how Kaspar Hauser's impulse affects present developments. I included working with planetary rhythms to better understand biographic developments and historical backgrounds related to healing education. How the cycles of planets, such as the Moon, Jupiter, and Saturn, could affect biography and social de velopments helped me gain insights into deeper layers of biography and history. I also employed other biographic rhythms to understand biography and history. I will give more explanation about this method in the chapter Biographic Rhythms . I wrote a few chapters on the topic of Kaspar Hauser's role in community development and social renewal. Although Kaspar Hauser's role in the development of anthroposophic 13 healing education is the main subject of this research, aspects of Kaspar Hauser's task were related to the development of brotherhood and sisterhood. Therefore, these chapters are pertinent. My own experience with anthroposophic healing education and insights were also part of this research. Clarification of Terminologies Terminologies used in Anthroposophy In this research, the view of the human being and the world has its foundation in the work of Rudolf Steiner: Anthroposophy. I will use some terminologies from Rudolf Steiner's work. Therefore, I would like to explain the basic terminology of Anthroposophy. There will be other terminologies of Anthroposophy, not mentioned in this chapter, that will be used in this research. I will explain those words each time I use them for clarification. Some of these terms will appear as quotes from various healing educa tors and writers. Anthroposophy Rudolf Steiner describes his view of the human being and the world as Anthroposophy. The word \"anthroposophic\" or \"anthroposophical\" is derived from the word Anthroposophy. In Leading Anthroposophy as follows: Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge, to guide the Spiritual in the human being to the Spiritual in the universe. It arises in man as a need of the heart , of the life of feeling; and it can be justi fied only inasmuch as it can satisfy this inner need. He alone can acknowledge Anthroposophy, who finds in it what he himself in his own inner life feels impelled to seek. Hence only they can be anthroposophists who feel certain questions on 14 the nature of man and the universe as an elemental need of life, just as one feels hunger and thirst. (p. 13) The work of Anthroposophy is not only theoretical knowledge but has many practical applications in the world. Steiner and Anthroposophy are increasingly well -known for applications in practical life: complementary medicine, Waldorf education, biodynamic farming, Camphill communities centered around special needs, arts and art therapies, and far -reaching social innovations. (Anthroposophical Society in Ame rica, n.d.) Body, Soul, and Spirit The theory of the human being is the foundation of Rudolf Steiner's work. Rudolf Steiner (1961/1994) described his view of the human being in Theosophy . Rudolf Steiner (1961/1994) sees the human being as a threefol d human being. The threefold view of the human being is described by the words with body, soul, and spirit (p. 24). The body enables the human being to relate to one's surroundings from without. What constitutes the materials in the environment is al so the makeup of the body. (Steiner, 1961/1994, pp. 24-25) The soul relates to occurrences as one's own experience. The soul experiences \"likes and dislikes, pleasure and displeasure, joy and sorrow.\" Such experiences by the soul are not perceptible to the bodily constitution of the human being. The inner world is created in the soul (Steiner, 1961/1994, pp. 24-25). Through the spirit, the divine nature of the outer world becomes a reality. Steiner (1961/1994) described the world of the spirit in the following way: 15 Although it is true that the secrets of the outer world disclose themselves inside us, in the spirit, we step outside of ourselves and let the things themselves tell us what is significant for them, rather than for us. When we look up at the starry sky, the soul's experience of delight belongs to us, but the eternal laws of the stars, which we may grasp in thought and in spirit, do not belong to us. They belong to the stars. (p. 25) The Physical Body, the Etheric Body, the Astral Bod y, and the I (the Ego) Looking at the human being in fourfoldness is also the foundation of Rudolf Steiner's work. The fourfold human being constitutes the physical body, the etheric body, the astral body, and the I (Steiner, 1961/1994, p. 61). Rudolf Steiner (1961/1994) characterized the physical body as follows. What lives in the human being whose substance is the same as the mineral world is called the physical body (p. 32). The physical body of the human being is filled with forces of life. Steiner (1961/1994) called the forces of life, the ether body or life body (p. 56). The etheric body has the capacity to propagate, grow and produce descendants. The capacity to propagate separates the etheric body from the physical body (p. 32). In the astral body, there lives the human being' s \"drives, desires, passions \" (Steiner, 1961/1994, p. 59). Feelings and emotions live in the astral body (K \u00f6nig, 1986/2009, p. 277). According to Steiner (1961/1994), the \"I\" enables each person to experience self - consciousness and as an autonomous human being (p. 48). The \"I\" is the human being's true self (p. 49). \"Within the human soul, the \"I\" flashes up, receiving the impact of the spirit\" (p. 58). The spirit gives life and streams from with in the \"I\" (p. 51). \"What there is of spirit in the \"I\" is eternal\" (p. 50). 16 Understanding and working out of Rudolf Steiner's view of the human being is essential to practice anthroposophic healing education. Curative Education, Social Therapy, and Healing Education In English, the term \"curative education\" is used for anthroposophic education of children with special needs. \"social therapy\" is used for anthroposophic work with adults with special needs. I will use these terms in this research as they are commonly used in anthroposophic healing education for people with special needs. \"Youth guidance\" is used for the work with young adults with special needs. I will not use the term youth guidance in this research because the term is not used as widely as curative education or social therapy. All curative education, youth guidance, and social therapy are \"healing education.\" Therefore I will use the term healing education for the title of this thesis. Obsolete Terminologies Not Used Anymore Today in the Field of Special Education Some of the words used in this research are obsolete and not used anymore today in special education. Such words are used only as parts of quotations from when they were written or spoken. The Biography of Kaspar Hauser Appearance in Nuremberg on Whit Monday, May 26, 1828 On Whit Monday, May 26, 1828, a young boy, who looked like an adolescent young man, appeared in one of the squares in Nuremberg, Germany. He stood there holding a grey hat in one hand (Pietzner, 1983, p. 9) and a letter in the other hand (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 18). The clothes he was wearing were very worn out (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 18). As Pietzner (1983) indicated that the address stated that th e letter was for the captain of a horse regiment in Nuremberg. The boots he wore were not the right size and were torn open. He had his toes 17 showing, and they were bleeding. He could hardly stay standing straight. His legs were frail and shaky. One of the citizens talked to him, wondering what the boy was doing. The only words he could speak were, \"Such a one I would like to become as my father was.\" Sometimes he said, \"I would like to become a horseman\" (pp. 9-10). He could not speak anything else. Pietzner (1983) further observed that no one could understand what was taking place. No one knew who this young man was, where he came from, and what to do with him. People then brought him to the captain's quarters as that was where the letter was addresse d. The boy could not walk. People had to help him reach the captain's quarters. As he got there, the police arrived, but they did not know what to do with him and make sense of what he was saying, either. People put him in a stable as there was nowhere else to go (p. 10). When the captain returned, he read the letter. The letter had two parts. One of the letters stated as follows: The boy had been born of a mother who did not know who the father was, only that he perhaps belonged to one of the horse regiments in Nuremberg. Kaspar had been brought up by a poor man who himself had ten children and could not keep him any longer. He had brought him up in a \"Christian fashion, but he isn't good for anything, he does not know where he came from and if the captain doesn't know what to do with him, well, he must either kill him or hang him in the chimney.\" (Pietzner, 1983, p. 11) The other letter was from this boy 's supposed mother saying that the boy 's name was Kaspar and she could not raise him. (B \u00f6hmer, 2019, p. 6) People gave him a piece of paper, and he wrote \"Kaspar Hauser.\" Those were the only words he could write. Since then, people have called him by the name \"Kaspar Hauser\" (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 15). There was not anyone who wanted to take care of him. The only place he could go was a prison. The boy was put in a prison, which was a tower in the town (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 18). 18 In this way, the prison guard of Nuremberg Castle, Hiltel, looked after Kaspar Hauser (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 15). Bread and water was the only food he was able to consume for a while. He could not eat or drink anything else. His stomach could not accept any other food (Pietzner, 1983, p. 11). Medical Examination by Dr. Preu Two days later, on May 28, 1828, the Nuremberg State Medical Officer Dr. Preu examined Kaspar Hauser (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 17). Dr. Preu concluded his report of this young man after the examination. A researcher of Kaspar Hauser in Germany, Hermann Pie s, reported that, \"This person [Kaspar Hauser] is neither mad nor stupid but has evidently been forcibly removed in the most brutal fashion from all intercourse with society and other human beings\" (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 17). Dr. Preu stated that one of his medical findings was the unusual formation of the hollow of the knee: Both knees evince an unusual formation. The end of the femur and tibia at the joint bend over steeply at the back and are sunk in deeply at the front together with the patella; thus when Hauser sits stretched out on the floor with his feet level with the hollow of the knee there is not [a] room for a piece of paper to be inserted between, though with most people a whole fist would fit in. (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 17) Dr. Preu continued to describe Kaspar Hauser's medical condition. Along with this peculiarity goes another one to be noticed when Hauser is sitting in this position. His back is then perfectly upright, his hands stretched out freely in the air, whereas everyone else sitting with his hands stretched out in this position would have to bend forwards. (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 17) 19 Sitting for many years since childhood while bones are still soft and flexible would be the only cause for thi s kind of unusual formation of bones: He arrived at the general conclusion that Kaspar Hauser was actually taken out of human society from earliest childhood and reared in a secret place into which the daylight could not penetrate, and was kept in this condition until the time when, as if dropped from the clouds, he appeared among us. And with that we have a physical anatomical proof that Kaspar Hauser did not come to us as a swindler. (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 18) The Mayor of Nuremberg, Mr. Binder, was also the Chief of Police. He was now in charge of conversing with Kaspar Hauser and investigating this case after Dr. Preu's medical analysis (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 18). Kaspar Hauser created a stir among people. People talked ab out him. Who was this boy? Where did he come from? What was he doing at a square in Nuremberg on May 26? Who were his parents? Many people came to see him, even from outside Nuremberg (Pietzner, 1983, p. 12). Meeting Professor Georg Friedrich Daumer Professor Georg Friedrich Daumer visited Kaspar Hauser soon after Hauser appeared on the street (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 20). Daumer was a professor at a high school in Nuremberg (Pietzner, 1983, p. 41). He considered the encounter, education, and w ork with Kaspar Hauser as his life's work (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, pp. 20-21). Professor Daumer would Kaspar Hauser and Kaspar Hauser's development. Tradowsky (1980/2012) observed that on July 18, 1828, Mayor Binder init iated an action for Professor Daumer to provide care and education to Kaspar Hauser (p. 21). Living in 20 Professor Daumer's residence became the first real experience of having a home for Kaspar Hauser (p. 21). At the same time, Baron von Tucher became Hause r's guardian (p. 40). As Professor Daumer educated him, Kaspar Hauser made tremendous progress in overall development, including reading and writing (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 20). Kaspar Hauser learned \"speaking, reading, writing, arithmetic, chess, piano, drawing, and watercolor painting \" (B\u00f6hmer, 2019, p. 8). Kaspar Hauser gradually learned ways to communicate with others. Remembering His Time in the Dungeon As he learned to communicate, Kaspar Hauser became able to describe the life he had lived before he appeared on the street of Nuremberg (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 20). Part of what Kaspar Hauser had written was translated from German to English as follows: This life story from my former condition written from memory. The prison in which I was obliged to live until my release was about six to seven feet long, four feet wide and five feet high. At the front there were two small windows with wooden shutters which looked quite black. (Daumer, 1983, as cited in Gibson, 1993, pp. 35-36) Kaspar Hauser further described his experience: On the floor there was straw on which I used to sit and sleep. My legs were covered from the knee with a rug. Next to my bed on the left there was a hole in the ground in which there was a pot; there was also a lid on it which I had to push aside and always cover it again. The clothes I wore in the prison were a shirt, short trousers but without a seat since I could not remove them to use the pot. (Daumer, 1983, as cited in Gibson, 1993, p. 36) Kaspar Hauser continued to communicate the life he had lived. 21 The braces were on my bare body and the shirt went over them. My food was nothing but bread and water, I occasionally had too little water but there was always enough bread. I had two [wooden] horses and a [wooden] dog wi th which I always kept myself amused. . . . I had no idea that there could be anyone other than me. . . . Usually I found the water quite good, but sometimes it was not so good and when I had drunk it I lost all my cheerfulness, ate no more, did not play e ither but fell asleep [consequence of the sedative that had been added to it]. When I awoke the light was always the same; I have never seen such daylight as the one I live in now. (Daumer, 1983, as cited in Gibson, 1993, pp. 36-37) Someone brought f ood and drink to the room while Kaspar Hauser was sleeping. Someone also cut his hair and his nails once in a while without Kaspar Hauser noticing when. His clothing was changed at times during sleep (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 21). Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach , the President of the Court of Appeal in Ansbach One of the other people who came to know Kaspar Hauser in the early days in Nuremberg was Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach who was \"the President of the Court of Appeal in Ansbach, criminologist and instru ctor in criminal law\" (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 25). He developed a tremendous amount of interest in Kaspar Hauser. He also recognized the innocence and the special soul qualities Kaspar Hauser had. Anselm von Feuerbach became determined to find answers to the enigma of Kaspar Hauser; who Kaspar Hauser was, who his family members were, where his family lived, and why he was placed in isolation for so many years (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 25). The First Attack 22 Kaspar Hauser was assaulted in Professor Daumer 's house on October 17, 1829 (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 48). When Professor Daumer 's mother saw Kaspar Hauser in the basement of their house, blood was all over the floor. Kaspar Hauser was lying without consciousness (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 22). Anse lm von Feuerbach' s opinion, as a criminologist, was that the assault tried to murder Kaspar Hauser. Because Kaspar Hauser quickly reacted, he survived with a cut on his forehead rather than on his neck (Tadowsky, 1980/2012, pp. 48-49). Kaspar Hauser survi ved the assassination attempt. A man whose name was Lord Stanhope was visiting near Nuremberg when Kaspar Hauser was assaulted (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 49). He was Lord Henry Stanhope from England (Wassermann, 1928/2012, p. 183). Lord Stanhope would eventually show much interest in Kaspar Hauser and would influence Kaspar Hauser's life in many ways after the assassination attempt. Lord Stanhope's involvement with Kaspar Hauser would develop negatively and bring tremendous challenges to Kaspar Hauser's life (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 49). Sometime after the assassination attempt, Kaspar Hauser's guardian, von Tucher, became fearful for Kaspar's safety. He decided to move Hauser from Daumer's house to that of councilor Bieberbach in Decem ber 1829. Then in May 1830, he moved Hauser again, this time, to his own house (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 22). Lord Stanhope and Moving to Ansbach At the end of May 1831, Lord Stanhope came back to Nuremberg and befriended Kaspar Hauser. Lord Stanhope gave many gifts to Hauser and spoke about making fanciful future plans with him (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, pp. 49-50). Baron von Tucher recognized the negative influence Lord Stanhope had on Kaspar Hauser. However, von Tucher could not defend Hauser from the impact Lord Stanhope had on him. Baron von Tucher wrote his experience as follows: 23 Lord Stanhope, who grew very fond of the boy, exerted a very adverse influence upon him. . . . This forces me, out of my duty as his guardian, to beg the latter to desist from all the insinuations unfavourable to Hauser's moral character or else to relieve me of the responsibility of my guardianship by taking over the care of my charge himself. Lord Stanhope chose the latter course, whereupon the guidance of my t utelage came to an end. (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 50) Lord Stanhope became Kaspar Hauser's guardian in November 1831 (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 50). Tradowsky (1980/2012) explained that Lord Stanhope then moved Kaspar Hauser t o the town of Ansbach, away from Nuremberg, where many people Kaspar Hauser was familiar with living. Lord Stanhope brought Kaspar Hauser to the house of a teacher whose name was Meyer (p. 52). Tradowsky (1980/2012) reported that Georg Meyer made Kaspar Ha user's life very miserable. Kaspar Hauser was \"treated in the most unsuitable and disagreeable manner\" by Georg Meyer. Kaspar Hauser lived with Georg Meyer from November 1831 to December 1833 (p. 53). While living in Ansbach, Kaspar Hauser worked for the a ppellate court, copying paperwork (B \u00f6hmer, 2019, p. 11). Confirmation Kaspar Hauser attended Confirmation classes from Pastor Fuhrmann. This was a positive experience for Hauser. Christianity, Kaspar Hauser learned from Pastor Fuhrmann, was spiritu ally alive (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, pp. 53-54). Religious instruction from Pastor Fuhrmann became an opportunity for Kaspar Hauser to learn about the life of Christ. Pastor Fuhrmann reported that Kaspar Hauser took religious education deeply into his heart and was always moved by Christ 's life stories (B \u00f6hmer, 2019, p. 11). 24 Kaspar Hauser received Confirmation from Pastor Fuhrmann in May, 1833, in the Chapel of the Knights of the Order of the Swan (B \u00f6hmer, 2019, p. 11). The Death of Anselm von Feuerba ch A tragic event happened soon after the Confirmation. Eight days had passed since the Confirmation. It was another Whit Monday. On May 28, 1833, Kaspar Hauser's good friend and supporter, Anselm von Feuerbach, suddenly died (Pietzner, 1983, 5. 504-508). Carlo Pietzner was Karl K \u00f6nig' s colleague who helped build Camphill Communities in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the United States (von Jeetze, 2004, p. 209). He was instrumental in developing Camphill Communities in the United States ( Pietzner, 1983, p. 1) and built up Camphill Village Copake in the US, starting in 1961 (Camphill Village Copake, n.d.). In 1975, Carlo Pietzner wrote a play about Kaspar Hauser . . . And From 1983, 31) . . . And From the Night, Kaspar can be found in a book called Who was Kaspar Hauser? One of the dialogues in the play described the account of Anselm von Feuerbach's death. The citation of the play indicates, other than the author and the date, the scene number and the line numbers. The line numbers constitute speeches by the characters and the Commentator, but do not include stage directions. On May twenty- eighth, the Monday of the Whitsun festival of 1833, while on a journey, President of the Appellate Court of Baden, Anselm von Feuerbach, Kaspar's protector, fell suddenly ill and died under suspicion of having been poisoned, retching and in great pain. He had found out, and written a m\u00e9moire in January of the year before and sent a copy to the Queen of Bavaria under the seal of complete secrecy, having been given a princely word of honour guaranteeing full discretion. 25 In this m \u00e9moire he revealed Kaspar 's origin as a prince and inheritor of a ducal throne who, because of a criminal matter of succession, had bee n removed from his crib four weeks after having been born on Michaelmas -day, September twenty -ninth, 1812; and he was replaced by a dying infant of lowly birth and removed, first to another country, then to solitary confinement for about twelve years. (Pie tzner, 1983, 5. 504-521) The Second Attack and Death After Anselm von Feuerbach died, Kaspar Hauser lived in Ansbach without a close friend. All Lord Stanhope did for Hauser was to send letters to him. He never came to see Kaspar Hauser anymore ( B\u00f6hmer, 2019, p. 12). On December 14, 1833, Kaspar Hauser was assaulted for the second time. An unknown person seduced Hauser to go to the Royal Court Gardens and gave him a pouch to look at (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 55). \" The dagger had penetrated his body below the heart , had thrust through the diaphragm and wounded the liver \" (K\u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 15). B\u00f6hmer (2019) wrote that Kaspar Hauser 's deepest longing always was to find out who his mother was. He expected to discover information a bout his origin in the purse he was given (p. 12). After he was stabbed, Kaspar struggled but walked back to Georg Meyer's house. Although Kaspar Hauser told Meyer what had happened, Georg Meyer did not believe him (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 55). In t he evening on December 17, at ten o'clock, Kaspar Hauser died (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, pp. 55-56). Before Kaspar Hauser's death, Pastor Fuhrmann asked if Hauser had anything to say as a confession. Hauser responded, \"'Why should I? I have asked all my friends for forgiveness. God will never abandon me '\" (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 15). Right before death, Kaspar Hauser thanked 26 all the people he knew. He forgave everyone. His forgiveness extended to Georg Meyer and the person who had murdered him (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 56). One of Kaspar Hauser's last words \"'Father, not my\u2014but thy will be done'\" (Wassermann, 1928/2012, p. 462). Some Characteristics of Kaspar Hauser in the Early Years After His Appearance in Nuremberg When Kaspar Hauser appeared on a square in Nuremberg, it is said that he experienced the world outside the confined room for the first time. As a result, his experiences of the world right after the appearance were acute. He often had severe reactions to sense impressions from his environment (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 21). All he knew before his appearance was the small room he lived in, \" about six to seven feet long, four feet wide and five feet high\" (Daumer, 1983, as cited in Gibson, 1993, p. 35). Kaspar Hauser only gradually becam e used to the wider world. The following examples are some descriptions of his experience from the early years since his appearance. These examples are presented as stories of the unique experiences that Kaspar Hauser had in the early years of his appearance. Those who read the details about Kaspar Hauser's life must have been awestruck at his capacity for pure perception. For most human beings, these experiences would happen only when one is a small child and everything appears for the first time. I will merely present his experiences but will not analyze them very much. All Kaspar Hauser Could Eat Initially Was Bread and Water When Kaspar Hauser appeared in Nuremberg and was waiting in a stable for the captain to return , people brought him meat and beer to eat and drink. However, he was not able to consume either of them. He was about to lose consciousness as he noticed the food coming close. Bread and water were all he could eat and drink for a while. He noticed even if only one drop of wine was in a pitcher of water he drank. He had adverse reactions (Pietzner, 1983, pp. 11-13.) 27 It was later discovered through his recollection that all he ate in the dungeon was bread and water (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 20). Standing and Walking in the First Few Days Kaspar Hauser could hardly hold himself standing. He could not walk by himself, either. He cried a lot, because he had a lot of pain through walking he must have done before getting to Nuremberg and when he was take n to the tower. He stumbled as he could not stand any longer. His feet were awkwardly turned inwards with every step. When the boots were taken off, his feet were blistered and the scars remained for months because his feet were as soft on the sole as the palm of a hand. (Pietzner, 1983, pp. 11-12) If his memory before his appearance in Nuremberg was correct, Kaspar Hauser had never stood up or walked during the confinement. The dungeon was too small to stand up, and he was tied to a wall (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 21). He Could Not Speak Initially The people who made the initial contact with Kaspar Hauser could not figure out how to communicate with him. The young man did not speak. He did not understand what people were saying to him, either. (Pie tzner, 1983, p. 13) Experience of a Candle Flame Kaspar Hauser liked it when candlelight was put in front of him. However, he did not know that the flame was scorching. Innocently he touched the flame directly with his hand and burned himself (Pietz ner, 1983, p. 13). Experiments with Swords 28 Soldiers and other people tried out experiments with swords. A soldier pretended to hit Kaspar Hauser with a sword. Kaspar Hauser, however, did not even blink. He had never thought that anyone would try to hurt him (Pietzner, 1983, p. 13). Looking Into a Mirror Kaspar Hauser looked at the mirror and saw himself but had no idea he was seeing himself . He thought there was someone there, and he was looking at the person. He reached out to touch the person in the mirror, but there was not anyone. He did not find anyone behind the mirror or behind himself, either (Pietzner, 1983, pp. 13-14). Initial Reac tion to Sound and Then Listening to Church Bells When Kaspar heard a band passing by playing music when he was in the tower, he reacted hysterically. He could not tolerate the sounds the band was making. Kaspar Hauser was initially very sensitive to various sounds (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 19). Eventually, as he became used to hearing, he began to appreciate the beautiful sounds he heard. Sometime after his appearance, Kaspar Hauser noticed that the church bells nearby were ringing. Kaspar Hauser stood motionless for a long time listening to the beauty of the church bell. He still stayed there listening even after the bell stopped ringing (Pietzner, 1983, p. 14). Unique Sensitivity to Metals Professor Daumer practiced some homeopathy and tested Kaspar Hauser's reactions to metals: A gold coin was placed on the table, or a silver compass or something made of copper, and paper cloth covered it so that he could not possibly see it. Kaspar would guide his fingers over the table, a few inches abo ve the covering and would be able to trace the outlines of the objects and know the metals. (Pietzner, 1983, p. 22) 29 Only someone who has a very developed sense of pure perception would be able to detect metals in such a way. When a Toy Horse Was Brought to Him At one point, a policeman brought a toy horse for him. Kaspar Hauser reacted with so much joy as he saw it. He held the toy horse with so much love as if he saw a friend he had not seen for a long time. For many days afterward, he played with the toy horse (Pietzner, 1983, p. 15). As mentioned earlier, Kaspar Hauser played with two wooden toy horses during confinement. Kaspar Hauser's Reactions to Colors Kaspar Hauser had positive reactions when he saw people wearing clothes with color. Often men in those days wore grey clothes. Therefore he often liked the colorful clothes women were wearing better (Pietzner, 1983, p. 16). His favorite color for a while was red. He was not fond of yellow. White did not interest him. He did not like black. He did not like green very much, either (Pietzner, 1983, p. 19). Kaspar's Relationship with Nature The process of growing and withering in nature was not what Kaspar Hauser could initially understand. Everything he had noticed before was human- made (Steuck, 2006, p. 23). Professor Daumer has recorded his experience of teaching Kaspar Hauser about the process of growth and decay in nature. Kaspar thought that trees and plants were all human beings' creations. When Daumer tried to teach him how nature's process worked, Kaspar Hauser did not believe him. Daumer continued: I let him plant seeds of various sorts in plant pots and told him what would happen (August 1828). He would believe all I told him, he s aid, if that was confirmed. When the 30 grains really sprouted he got into an indescribable state of excitement, of joy and wonder, and since that time he looks upon nature with quite different eyes. (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 25) Kaspar Hauser's relationship with nature was very genuine. It was amazing how much of a sense of wonder he had developed about the natural world. Drawing and Painting Anselm von Feuerbach recorded his experience of Kaspar Hauser's fondness of drawing and painting as follows. \"One of his favorite pastimes apart from writing was drawing, a subject to which he brought just as much talent as persistence\" (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 30). There are descriptions of Kaspar Hauser 's relationship to painting by ot her authors. \" Kaspar developed a very special relationship to flowers and learned to do beautiful watercolor flower paintings \" (Steuck, 2006, p. 23). Karl K \u00f6nig (1961/2012a) also mentioned how beautiful Kaspar Hauser's artwork was when he visited the muse um in Ansbach. \"Some of the letters are displayed and several of his exercise books. They contain some lovely water -colors of flowers and fruits very delicately painted\" (p. 16). Kaspar Hauser was a very good artist. Kaspar Hauser's Relationship with Anima ls Kaspar Hauser had an amazing relationship with animals. Professor Daumer wrote about Kaspar Hauser's relationship with cats as follows: This cat ate nothing but meat and milk; it would not touch dry bread even when it was very hungry. However, whe n Hauser fed it, it would eat a great deal of black bread even when it was not particularly hungry and even fruit. I once gave stewed apples to eat, which it sniffed at and then ignored, then Hauser picked it up and offered it to the cat and it ate it at o nce. (Daumer, 1983, as cited in Gibson, 1993, p. 33) 31 Kaspar Hauser could relate to animals as no other could. He had an ability to quiet down animals. Many animals came near Kaspar Hauser in friendly ways (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 19). Kaspar Hauser L ooking at the Starry Sky The following quote describes how Hauser was struck by awe when he saw the beauty of the starry world at night: It was in the month of August 1829, when on a beautiful clear summer evening, Daumer showed him the starry sky. Kaspar's astonishment and delight went beyond all description. He could not possibly take his eyes away; again and again he returned from inside the house. He straightway took into his gaze definite groups of stars, distinguishing the lighter ones from th ose that were less light, and also their different colors. He called out \"This is the most beautiful thing I have seen in this world! Who has put the lights there, who is lighting them, who is quenching them?\" (Pietzner, 1983, p. 20) \"Quenching them\" ref ers to how the stars became invisible during the day as morning came (Pietzner, 1983, pp. 20-21). This experience is another example of how much sense of wonder Kaspar Hauser had of the natural world. Kaspar Hauser's Experience of the World After Starting to Eat Meat Since Professor Freidrich Daumer started to look after and educate Kaspar Hauser, Hauser made much progress in learning to speak and write (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 20). He also became able to eat different kinds of food, other than bread and water. Professor Daumer later said that one and the only mistake he had made in educating Hauser was including meat to Hauser's diet. Professor Daumer further observed that Kaspar Hauser's influence to calm untamed animals became less and less as Kaspar Hauser started to eat a wider variety of food (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 48). 32 Pure Soul Qualities of Kaspar Hauser One of Kaspar Hauser's special qualities people around him observed was his pure soul qualities. People were amazed by Kaspar Hauser's innocence when he appeared for the first time in Nuremberg. The first person who took care of Kaspar Hauser in Nuremberg was jailer Hiltel (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 15). There are descriptions l eft of how Hiltel experienced Kaspar Hauser when Hauser was placed in the tower. \"The first thing that strikes Hiltel about the inconspicuous young man, who is quite unable to make himself understood, is his pure , innocent, childlike soul qualities\" (Trado wsky, 1980/2012, Professor Daumer's record, Hiltel stated as follows: Hauser was a pure child to begin with, even less than a child. To fraudulently misrepresent such a phenomenon is beyond human capacity. His innocence is so patent that he [Hi ltel] would be forced to bear witness to it even if God Himself were to assert the opposite. (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 16) Both Georg Friedrich Daumer and Anselm von Feuerbach, who became well acquainted with Kaspar Hauser soon after his appearance in Nuremberg, spoke in many different ways to describe Kaspar Hauser's pure soul qualities. Professor Daumer made the following statement: It was not only the romantic singular destiny and his appearance that attracted and captivated people, i t was the unique childlike quality and charm of his being and the unblemished beauty of his soul which many found so enchanting. (as cited in Selg, 2012, p. 38) Professor Daumer also wrote about Kaspar Hauser in the following way. Hauser is in every respect the image of complete moral chastity and innocence. He has a 33 charming amiability which conquers every heart . . . He would never hurt the smallest insect, and has a deep aversion against anything that would cause pain to a human being or an animal. H e is filled with obedience and good will, and free of any naughtiness and bad habits. (as cited in K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 19) Professor Daumer described Kaspar Hauser in many other ways. One could experience the warmth and love Professor Daumer had f or Kaspar Hauser in the many descriptions he had left about Kaspar Hauser. \"Georg Friedrich Daumer spoke of an 'angelic pure human being with the most refined sense of morality and the most rigorous love of truth.' and also of the 'paradisal innocenc e and purity' of Kaspar Hauser's being.\" He also said, \"When Hauser came into the world out of his place of concealment, his soul was the mirror and reflection of a heavenly goodness, purity and innocence; no comparable example has hitherto appeared or com e to light\" (Selg, 2012, p. 39). Anselm von Feuerbach also left many descriptions of his experience with Kaspar Hauser: For Feuerbach Kaspar Hauser's appearance contradicted the doctrine sin; he also wrote about Hauser's \"purest innocen ce and goodness of heart \" in the early period after his appearance in Nuremberg and spoke of a soul \"full of childlike goodness and gentleness,\" which rendered him incapable of inflicting pain and injury on another being, a soul that was in every respect as \"pure and without blemish . . . as the reflection of the eternal in the soul of an angel.\" (Selg, 2012, p. 39) Kaspar Hauser's first guardian, Baron von Tucker, also wrote down his experience of Kaspar Hauser. \"Gottfried von Tucher, recorded, 'The way this person was when I found and 34 described him, with his natural purity and lack of self -consciousness, gave one the most perfect impression of the first human being in paradise before the Fall'\" (as cited in Selg, 2012, p. 39). What further d escription is needed to explain Kaspar Hauser's purity and innocence? Many people who met Kaspar Hauser in the early days since his appearance attested to these qualities. It was his innocence and pureness that many people remembered him for in the subsequent generations. Kaspar Hauser was remembered not only because of the unique life he had lived but also because of what a wonderful human being he was. The Child of Europe People called Kaspar Hauser \"the Child of Europe.\" \"Otto von Pirch Gottfried von Tucher on April 4, 1830: 'Kaspar Hauser has, one may say, become the Child of Europe.'\" (Selg, 2012, p. 38). When people called Kaspar Hauser the Child of Europe, what did people mean? Why was such a name given to him? A British Rese archer of Kaspar Hauser and Anthroposophy, Terry Boardman (2006), wrote in his book Kaspar Hauser: Where Did He Come From?, about why Kaspar Hauser became called the Child of Europe. The name \"Child of Europe\" was spontaneously given to Kaspar, in July 1828, before there was any talk of Kaspar's origin. A child was given to Old Europe, an impulse of supersensible into the sensible. Not a child of one or two people but of all the peoples of Europe. As Jesus had been welcomed with almost universal joy into Je rusalem on Palm Sunday, but abandoned by the fickle and forgetful populace and crucified within five days, so was Kaspar welcomed with great interest and warmth into Nuremberg, Germany and Europe on Whit Monday, but abandoned by the fickle and forgetful population after three years and murdered after five. (p. 161) 35 Kaspar Hauser 's life story spoke to people 's hearts and ignited love. People became interested in him, talked about him, and wanted to know more about him. (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 17). \"The pure childlike forces in Kaspar Hauser were the real reason for his having been called 'the Child of Europe'\" (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 266). To experience the quality of childhood that Kaspar Hauser possessed was special. European civilization had striven for the ideals of the human being for many years. In Kaspar Hauser, people in Europe experienced the ideal they were looking for. He possessed a pure soul that many people in Europe had lost and were striving to rediscover. After the Napoleo nic Wars, people's hearts were not at peace. The development of science was starting to come into the foreground. The achievements in culture, art, and music that had flourished in Europe for many years, was starting to come to a place of transition, rest, and metamorphosis. The great philosophers, such as Schiller and Fichte had departed from the earth already. Goethe and Hegel were not as active anymore. Keate, Shelley, Novalis, and Holderline, the great poets who represented the romantic period, were not alive or were coming to the end of their lives. Kaspar Hauser appeared at the time of such change and confusion. People were seeking something new. Kaspar Hauser appeared like he was representing the future of Europe (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, pp. 25-26). Selg (2012) wrote that Kaspar Hauser's innocence reminded people of \"the first human being in paradise before the Fall\" (p. 39). As much as the Child of Europe helped people reconnect to the first human being in the distant past, he also answered a longing that people were experiencing. He helped them feel anew what they could become in the future. Who was Kaspar Hauser? 36 Since the day Kaspar Hauser appeared in Nuremberg, people have asked who Kaspar Hauser was. \" The story of Kaspar Hauser has never ceased to touch human hearts. Year after year, books and pamphlets are written about this unhappy child\" (K\u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 25). People around the world continue to research the mystery of Kaspar Hauser. Even after two hundred years, there has not been one conclusive answer about his origin and identity. However, many kinds of research have been made, and there are theories as to who Kaspar Hauser was. The Research by Anselm von Feuerbach While Kaspar Hauser was Still Alive As mentioned in a previous chapter, The Biography of Kaspar Hauser , Carlo Pietzner has written the conclusion of Anselm von Feuerbach's research on the origin of Kaspar Hauser in his play, . . . And From the Night, Kaspar . The pertinent section is reiterated below with additional sentences. On May twenty- eighth, the Monday of the Whitsun Festival of 1833, while on a journey, President of the Appellate Court of Baden, Anselm von Feuerbach, Kaspar's protector, fell suddenly ill and died under suspicion of having been poisoned, retching and in great pain. He had found out, and written a m \u00e9moire in January of the year before and sent a copy to the Queen of Bavaria under the seal of complete secrecy, having been given a prince ly word of honour guaranteeing full discretion. In this m \u00e9moire he revealed Kaspar 's origin as a prince and inheritor of a ducal throne who, because of a criminal matter of succession, had been removed from his crib four weeks after having been born on Michaelmas- day, September twenty -ninth, 1812; and he was replaced by a dying infant of lowly birth and removed, first to another country, then to solitary confinement for about twelve years, thus severing him from his 37 first mission which, later, would have profoundly changed the whole course of development in Middle -Europe through his endowment with unusual gifts with the help of which his tasks had been intended to be fulfilled. But he was not to be killed at first. (Pietzner, 1983, 5. 504-527) The Hereditary Prince of the House of Baden Anselm Feuerbach lived as an instructor in criminal law. He was the President of the Court of Appeal in Ansbach. (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 25). He studied and investigated the origin of Kaspar Hauser as a criminol ogist. His investigation developed as follows. Kaspar Hauser could only be a legitimate child of a high birth. There is no conceivable situation \u2014Feuerbach studied that in detail \u2014in which an illegitimate child, or one from a lower class, could be involved i n the cause of such an extensive crime stretching over more than two decades. (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 10) \"By investigating the German families of the time in question, Feuerbach came to the conclusion that it was only in the Zahringen dynasty where circ umstances were present which could cause suspicion\" (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 10). Peter Tradowsky has done research on Kaspar Hauser. He has written about and has given lectures about Kaspar Hauser (B \u00f6hmer, 2020, p. 7). His research is written in h is book Kaspar Hauser: The Struggle for the Spirit. In his book, Peter Tradowsky (1980/2012) also wrote about the memoirs Feuerbach had sent to Queen Karolina in Bavaria, as Carlo Pietzner had written in his play. \"The identity of Kaspar Hauser as the heir apparent to the throne of Baden had been made clear to Queen Karoline of Bavaria, the aunt of Kaspar Hauser, in the 'Memoirs' of Feuerbach in 1832\" (p. 285). Peter Tradowsky further wrote about Feuerbach's research as follows: 38 The wife of the Grand Duke of Baden, Stephanie de Beauharnais, had given birth to five children, of which two were sons, whose health had been expressly confirmed by the doctors, but who, nevertheless, both died suddenly as infants: the first of these on 16 October 1812; his brother , Alexander, at one year old in 1817. Three other heirs to the throne perished under more or less peculiar circumstances, a fact to which Hermann Pies points to, so that the unusual fact remains that, although five legitimate heirs to the throne existed, t he regular Z \u00e4hringen dynasty died out in male line. In this way Leopold, the son of the Grand Duchess von Hochberg, became the Grand Duke of Baden in 1830, that is during the lifetime of Kaspar Hauser. (p. 10) According to this theory, the first son who died on 16 October 1812 was the child who replaced Kaspar Hauser. A recent researcher of Kaspar Hauser in the twenty -first century, Eckart B \u00f6hmer (2019), has written more about how careful Feuerbach was in revealing his research to the public about Kaspar Hauser. In the year 1832 Feuerbach had published his important book on the foundling, Kaspar Hauser or An Example of a Crime Against the Soul Life of the Human Being. To this day, this book is a most important foundation for any research on Kaspar Ha user. But in this book, Feuerbach holds back almost entirely in regard to the political dimension of the wrongdoing concerning Kaspar Hauser. He knows that this topic is too dangerous. He keeps this part of his research hidden, and only sends it in a \"secr et memoire\" to the Queen Dowager Caroline of Munich. (pp. 11-12) The Announcement in 1875 39 After Kaspar Hauser died in 1833, there were efforts to end further discussion of the enigma of Kaspar Hauser. Clearly, some people did not want the invest igation of Kaspar Hauser's identity to continue. Pies reported as follows: In 1875, the discussion regarding the princely heritage of Kaspar Hauser to the throne of Baden came to an end through the fact that the certificates of the birth, illness and death in 1812 were published. This circumstance led to anomaly. The Hohenzollern Emperor, at that time William I, himself arranged for the publication of these documents. (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 11) The right procedure did not occur to confi rm the child's identity by the mother or the wet-nurse. Appropriate process of autopsy for this investigation did not happen, either (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 11). Stephanie de Beauharnais Stephanie de Beauharnais was Napoleon 's adopted daughter (Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 9). K \u00f6nig (1961/2012a) wrote that she was Josephine 's niece. Josephine was Napoleon 's first wife. Napoleon liked Stephanie de Beauharnais very much and raised her like a biological daughter. In 1806, she was married to Cr own Prince Karl of Baden. Stephanie's connections were manifold. She was not only the beloved adopted daughter of Napoleon. She was a friend of Alexander I, Emperor of Russia, and she had free access to all the ruling families of her time. Her first- born son would have had enormous influence had he lived to become his father's successor. (p. 23) If Stephanie de Beauharnais were Kaspar Hauser's mother, that would make Napoleon Kaspar Hauser's grandfather. The Mansion in Pilsach 40 Hofer reported that a person purchased a mansion in Pilsach, which had a room that fitted Kaspar Hauser's description of where he had lived. She published a book in 1924 and revealed where Kaspar Hauser was imprisoned. Some straw was left on the floor and small pieces of clothing were still in the room, as well (as cited in K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, pp. 21-22). Recent Research at the End of the Twentieth Century At the end of the twentieth century and at the beginning of the twenty- first century, different research was published. Researchers worked on DNA testing to detect if Kaspar Hauser was the hereditary prince of the House of Baden or not. The test results sh owed different answers. In November 1996 the German magazine \"Der Spiegel\" reported an attempt to genetically match a blood sample from pants assumed to have been Kaspar Hauser's. This analysis was made in the laboratories of the Forensic Science Service in Birmingham and in the LMU Institute of Legal Medicine in the University of Munich. Comparisons with the members of the royal family were inconclusive. It later became clear that the examined pants did not come from Kaspar Hauser but probably from the exhibition of the trousers claimed to be Kaspar Hauser 's in Berlin police headquarters in 1905 . . . In 2002, however, the Institute for Forensic Medicine of the University of M\u00fcnster analyzed hair and body cells that were also alleged to belong to Kaspar Hauser, and came to a more conclusive result. From different sources six samples altogether were taken: The boy's hat and trousers along with his hair curls, partially from the private collection of the Ansbacher chief presiding judge Feuerbach. The analys is took a long time as the results in the laboratory were examined several times over for the sake of accuracy. The genetic code was the same in all six samples, and was a 95% match to that 41 of Astrid von Medinger, a descendant of Stephanie de Beauharnais, who would have been Kaspar Hauser's mother if indeed he had been the hereditary prince of Baden. The DNA evidence would seem to argue that Kaspar Hauser was indeed a descendant of the House of Baden. (Boardman, 2006, p. 163) Whether Kaspar Hauser was the hereditary prince or not is still considered inconclusive after these test results. According to B \u00f6hmer (2019), as much as the test result in 2002 was a high level of match, it was not a complete match (p. 19). Prof. Dr. Brinkmann, who was the lead scientist of the research in 2002, stated as follows. \" One can not say that Kaspar Hauser was the hereditary prince, nor can one say that he was not \" (as cited in B \u00f6hmer, 2019, p. 19). Although the truth of Kaspar Hauser 's heredity is still inconclusive, and I stand for the truth, I lean toward taking the view that Kaspar Hauser was the hereditary prince of Baden. That view comes from Feuerbach 's research, Karl K \u00f6nig' s studies, and the recent researchers in the twentieth century. What Rudolf Steiner said is also part of the reason. What Rudolf Steiner had said about Kaspar Hauser will be introduced in the chapter, What Rudolf Steiner said about Kaspar Hauser . Kaspar Hauser in Motion Pict ures I will introduce two films that were created about Kaspar Hauser since the 1970s. These films won prestigious film awards. These films are introduced to show that Kaspar Hauser being a possible hereditary prince of Baden is known, and also to show that the story of Kaspar Hauser is known in the world. \"The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser\" by Werner Herzog German filmmaker Werner Herzog produced and directed a motion picture about Kaspar Hauser in 1974. The film was in German. The title of the moti on picture was The Enigma of 42 Kaspar Hauser . The film won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival (Herzog, 1974). The film included the following dialogue: \"Other citizens say he [Kaspar Hauser] is a member of the Baden dynasty, who is to be eliminated as the most likely heir. The Baden dynasty however is beyond all reproach. Besides, there are better ways of getting rid of unwanted heirs\" (Herzog, 1974). The dialogue is in German and the English translation is derived from the subtitle. S uch a dialogue spoken in a well -known film shows that Kaspar Hauser's knowledge of being the possible heir of the Baden dynasty was common. \"Kaspar Hauser\" by Peter Sehr In 1993, Peter Sehr wrote and directed a Kaspar Hauser film, also in Germany. The title of the film was Kaspar Hauser . The film featured the theory that Kaspar Hauser was the prince of the Baden dynasty (B \u00f6hmer, 2019, p. 86). The entire film was created from the perspective of this theory. The film won the Best Picture, Director, and Actor in the German Film Awards in 1994 (IMDb, n.b.). Kaspar Hauser's Dreams \"Kaspar Hauser had several prophetic dreams. These dreams were recorded by Professor Daumer\" (Steel, personal communication, November 4, 2018). After Kaspar Hauser's death, researchers came to a theory that these dreams had the nature to foretell Kaspar Hauser's future and Kaspar Hauser's tasks on earth (Pietzner, 1983, 6. 656-658). Some of his dreams' English translations are included in the book Kaspar Hauser Speaks for Himself . The writings are English translations of Kaspar Hauser's own words. Georg Friedrich Daumer's comments and notes are also included in the book (Gibson, 1993, p. 25). 43 Professor Daumer wrote, \"In the spring of 1829 he had the following dream: A beautiful male figure in white raiment approached his [Kaspar's] bed and handed him a garland with the remark that he would die in a fortnight\" (Daumer, 1983, as cited in Gibson, 1993, p. 47). Daumer asked Hauser to record his dream. The following writing is what Hauser wrote: On the night of the 2nd of April I had a dream as if in r eality I had seen a man with a white cloth hanging around his body, with bare hands and feet and he had looked wonderfully beautiful. Then he stretched out his hand to me with something that looked like a garland; then he said that I should take it; then I wanted to take it; then he replied in two weeks you must die; then I replied, I do not want to die yet, because I have not been on earth very long and did not take the garland \u2014when he replied to me: so much the better. Then he stood for a while before me as I did not take the garland, he walked backwards towards the table and laid it on the table; as soon as he had laid it on the table, I got up and I approached, it had begun to shine wonderfully. Then I took it and went towards my bed\u2014as I approached my b ed it began to shine more and more strongly, then I said: I will die; then he was gone; I wanted to get into bed, then I woke up. (Daumer, 1983, as cited in Gibson, 1993, pp. 47-48) \"Professor Daumer recorded these dreams, but he did not make much ef fort in interpreting them\" (Steel, personal communication, November 4, 2018). Two of Kaspar Hauser's dreams are included in Carlo Pietzner's Kaspar Hauser . . . And From the Kaspar. \"Many of the lines in Carlo Pietzner's Kaspar Hauser play were what Kaspar Hauser had actually said\" (Steel, personal communication, November 4, 2018). One of the dreams Carlo Pietzner included in his play was the dream described above about the garland and the man with a white cloth. 44 A Tree That Had a Crown So Slen der with Red Berries in It The second dream included in Carlo Pietzner's play was the following dream. The words are from . . . And From the Night, Kaspar the winter from 1830 to 1831, Kaspar was visited by an image in which he confirmed him self in his life and in his task and in his death\" (Pietzner, 1983, 6. 656- 658). Then everything whatsoever became quite clear to me through the image I saw, which visited me and whose significance I understood at once and completely. For I beheld th at all and everything in all its manifoldness was at one and the same time One; all of mankind together with all nature but in such a manner that it was in truth mankind that made it into One. I saw this in the image as a tree whose branches moved an d formed all manner of signs and figures. These were all transparently clear in their meaning. Opposing branches moved into one another and through this interpenetration the wholeness was created. The tree itself stood upon a base which was solid and from below to its top reached something like an innermost pole on the very tip of which there was so slender a crown with a red berry in it \u2014which was the chief aspect of the image. In its power I was to assemble around me such men and women who would be a ble to read the signs of the branches and who would thus themselves become branches of a new order. They would flower with the radiance of freedom in their thoughts, each live with equal acceptance of one another and pulsing with the fraternal blood of the brotherhood to which I was called. I remember it, my brothers, I begin to remember . . . He who has ears shall hear . . . (Pietzner, 1983, 6. 666-695) 45 This dream directly meant Kaspar Hauser's task to bring humanity together, to assemble a community of human beings as brothers and sisters. Many people experienced a spiritual connection to Kaspar Hauser in the twentieth century and considered themselves the brothers and sisters of Kaspar Hauser. People who experienced a spiritual connection to Kaspar Hauser in the Camphill Community were examples of such people. Many people continue to have such experiences in the twenty -first century. I AM the True Vine The closest image to the image of the tree described in Kaspar Hauser's dream that I found in other literature was the image in The New Testament, \"I AM the true vine\" (Suesada, 2018, p. 10). This is found in the Gospel of St. John, Chapter 15: I AM the true vine and my Father is the vinedresser. Every branch of mine that bears no fruit HE takes away, and every branch that does bear fruit HE makes pure , that it may bear more fruit. You have already been purified by the power of the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it is given life by the vine, neither can you unless you stay united with me. I AM the vine, you are the branches. He who remains united with me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. If someone does not remain united with my being, he withers like a branch that is cut off \u2014such branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned. If you abide in me and my words live on in you, pray for that which you also will and it shall come about for you. By this my Father is r evealed, that you bear much fruit and become ever more my disciples. 46 As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you \u2014live on in my love. If you take my aims into your will, then you will live on in my love, just as I have taken the aims of my Father into my will and live on in HIS love. These words I have spoken to you that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete. This is the task I put before you, that you love one another as I have loved you. No man can have greater love than this, he offers up his life for his friend. ( The New Testament: A Rendering by Jon Madson, 1994/2006, John 15: 1-13) Both Kaspar Hauser's dream and the Bible's passage signify humanity's striving to become brothers and sisters of the Spirit. The striving is for the spiritual evolution of humankind and the future of the world. Contrary to these spiritual ideals, Europe developed in other directions in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. Materialistic sciences developed in the nineteenth century. The consequences of the development of materialistic sciences will be elaborated on i n the following chapter. In the twentieth century, two World Wars devastated humanity and led to unprecedented destruction. Scientific Developments in the Nineteenth Century The Development of Materialistic Sciences In the nineteenth century, much scientific development took place. The scientists in countries like Germany, Britain, France, Russia, and the USA made new scientific discoveries. The development of science changed people's lives. New methods of agriculture, industry, and communication we re used. Science changed how human beings view the world (Woolf, 2008, p. 242). K \u00f6nig (1961/2012a) wrote about the development as follows. \" Agnosticism and 47 materialism began to unite with science and brought about the ominous wedlock of the nineteenth century\" (pp. 25-26). Agnosticism is defined as \"the view that any ultimate reality (such as a deity) is unknown and probably unknowable : a philosophical or religious position characterized by uncertainty about the existence of a god or any gods\" (Merriam -Webster, n.d.a). Materialism is defined as \"a tendency to consider material possessions and physical comfort as more important than spirit ual values\" (Lexico, n.d.). It is also \"the theory or belief that nothing exists except matter and its movements and modifications\" (Lexico, n.d.). The existence of spirit is not considered important in these worldviews. Darwinism Charles Darwin, w ho was an English naturalist, published On the Origin of Species in 1859. He supported a scientific theory that plant and animal species made evolutions (Woolf, 2008, p. 243). Darwin claimed that evolution took place through the process of natural selection. He claimed that \"life forms best suited to a particular environment are most likely to survive and reproduce\" (Woolf, 2008, p. 243). Darwin devised a theory that human beings had evolved from \"apelike ancestors\" based on his studies (Woolf, 2008, p. 243). As Darwinism became recognized as a valid scientific theory, the view of the human being dramatically changed. The view of the human being described in the Bible, \"So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them\" ( The Holy Bible: King James Version , n.d. Genesis 1:27) was no longer the most accepted view. The views of the human being told in various myths around the world were no longer considered scientific. 48 Instead, out of Darwin's theory of natural selection, human beings became a mere existence \"evolved from apelike ancestors.\" Such a theory became the dominant theory about the human being (Woolf, 2008, p. 243). The view of the human being and the world no longer carried spirituali ty at the end of the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth century. Anthroposophy as a Spiritual View of the Human Being and the World McDermott (2007) recorded that Rudolf Steiner was born in 1861 (p. 25) and passed away in 1925 (p. 33). He was born in Austria and was a \"philosopher, scientist, artist and educator\" (Preface, para. 1). His contribution to the world lived in many different fields of study. [Rudolf Steiner has produced] 350 printed books \u201442 written books, and over 300 setting down the spoken word: also there are his epoch -making buildings, world -wide Waldorf education, anthroposophical medicine, biodynamic agriculture, curative education, eurythmy, speech- formation, the Mystery Dramas, and, not least, the idea of social renewal \u2014the threefold life of the social organism. (Prokofieff, 1986/2017, p. 23) Rudolf Steiner brought about the spiritual view of the human being and the world. His worldview is represented in Steiner's (1973/2007) quote as follows. \"Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge, to guide the Spiritual in the human being to the Spiritual in the universe\" (p. 13). His view of the human being and the world was completely different from Darwin's view and views such as agnosticism and materialism that developed in the nineteenth century. Rudolf Steiner and Education for the People with Special Needs Anthroposophic curative education and social therapy originated from the work of Rudolf Steiner. While Rudolf Steiner gave lectures on the topic of education for people with special 49 needs towards the end of his life, he himself worked with a child with special needs when he was young. Otto Specht Rudolf Steiner was involved with the education of a child who had special needs for six years. When Steiner was a student during his twenties, he lived with a family in Vienna. Steiner worked as a tutor for the four children (Luxford, 1994/2006, p. 19). Among the four children, Otto Specht was whom Rudolf Steiner tutored (Easton, 1980, p. 37). Otto had hydrocephalus, and it was a challenge for Rudolf Steiner to teach this child (Luxford, 1994/2006, p. 19). Still, his experience of teaching Otto helped Rudolf Steiner understand the nat ure of the human being and the healing process of education. Rudolf Steiner (2006) said in his Autobiography . \"After I had gotten to know the child, I felt certain that an education adapted to this particular soul and bodily constitution would awaken his dormant capacities\" (p. 51). I had to find access to a soul that was dormant, as it were, and had to be gradually brought to master the bodily expression. First, the soul had to be helped to enter the body. I was convinced that the boy had great intellec tual capacities. But this was not apparent, and it made my task deeply satisfying. (p. 51) Rudolf Steiner also wrote about his experience working with Otto as follows. This educational task became a rich source of learning for me. The educational methods I had to adopt gave me insight into how the soul and spirit are connected with the human bodily nature. In fact, it became my training in physiology and psychology. I came to realize that education and teaching must become an art based on true knowledge of the human being. (p. 52) 50 Anthroposophy offers many ways to understand \"true knowledge of the human being.\" Some ways to understand such knowledge are to learn about the threefold human being (body, soul, and spirit) and the fourfold human being (the physical body, the etheric body, the astral body, and the I). Anthroposophy offers many more ways to understand the human being. The essence of such \"true knowledge of the human being\" is to view that the human being is a spiritual being. With Rudolf Steiner's help, Otto finished secondary education, medical school and eventually became a medical doctor (Steiner, 2006, p. 52). Rudolf Steiner practiced healing education during his younger years and awakened Otto's dormant faculties to help with his development. It was significant he had the experience of practicing healing education. His experience with Otto shows that Steiner's theory of healing education is not theoretical and has its foundation on his experience. The Founding of Anthroposophic Cur ative Education After World War I, Siegfried Pickert and Franz L \u00f6ffler, both young teachers, began curative education work at Jena, Germany. They came to know Albrecht Strohschein. He was a psychology student. The three people approached Rudolf Stei ner and asked questions about curative education (Luxford, 1994/2006, p. 28). Rudolf Steiner conversed with Pickert, L \u00f6ffler, and Strohschein, Steiner gave his insight into people with special needs. The conversation was documented by Albrecht Strohschein (1972/1998) and could be found in the Introduction: The Beginning of Curative Education in Rudolf Steiner's (1972/1998) lecture series Education for Special Needs: The Curative Education Course . Strohschein (1972/1998) wrote what Rudolf Steiner had told Pickert, Loffler, and him. 51 He spoke so impressively how these \"abnormal\" children can not incarnate completely with their ego and astral body, and for this reason are already concerned with shaping a future earthly life, that we could only listen and take it in with all our senses. (p. 3) Strohschein also wrote as follows. At the end I asked what such a difficult earthly life really meant for the souls of the so - called pathological or feeble -minded children, Rudolf Steiner waited a little while and then quietly replied: \"When in my investigations I look back, starting from the genius of today, I always find that a genius has gone through at least one such feeble -minded incarnation.\" (pp. 3-4) In this quote, Rudolf Steiner indicated the connections people with special needs may have with geniuses from the point of view of reincarnation and karma. The potential and the possibilities of the people with special needs are spoken of. Healing educators who work with people with special needs need to know this quote by Rudolf Steiner to understand what the healing educators might be worki ng with. Siegried Pickert remembered that Rudolf Steiner had also said as follows. When I visit the class for mentally handicapped children at the Stuttgart Waldorf School, I say to myself: \"Here one is working for the next earth -life, quite apart from wha t is accomplished now, which however can be a very great deal.\" (as cited in Strohschein, 1972/1998, p. 4) Steiner said that the people were working on their next earth life. (as cited in Strohschein, 1972/1998, p. 4) All these words by Steiner are what healing educators can take into their hearts and ponder for the practice of healing education. Pickert, L \u00f6ffler and Strohschein started a new 52 initiative called Lauenstein. Rudolf Steiner visited the initiative and saw the children. Steiner gave medical and therapeutic advice to them (Luxford, 1994/2006, p. 28). Around the same time, similar developments of curative education impulses were starting inspired by Rudolf Steiner and for the people who were working with him. Some parents had brought children with special needs to Rudolf Steiner in Dornach. Dr. Ita Wegman started a small house called Die Holle dedicated to curative education in response to these needs. The first children with special needs had attended the Waldorf School in Stuttgart. Rudol f Steiner asked the Austrian teacher, Dr. Karl Schubert, to teach these children (Strohschein, 1972/1998, p. 11). Dr. Ita Wegman was a medical doctor. She and Rudolf Steiner founded Anthroposophical Medicine. The first anthroposophical medical clin ic in Arlesheim, Switzerland, was founded by Ita Wegman (Villeneuve, 1993). Education for Special Needs: The Curative Education Course After visiting Lauenstein, Rudolf Steiner (1972/1998) gave a course on curative education in Dornach, Switzerland. Twelve lectures were given from June 25 to July 7 in 1924. These lectures are published as the book Education for Special Needs: The Curative Education Course. The practitioners of anthroposophic curative education and social therapy often call the lecture series, The Curative Education Course. Therefore, this lecture cycle from now on will be called The Curative Education Course. Those who attended these lectures were Pickert, L \u00f6ffler and Stro hschein from Lauenstein. Dr. Schubert and Dr. Eugen Kolisko came from Stuttgart. Dr. Kolisko was a curative educator and the doctor of the Waldorf school. Dr. Ernst Lehrs, who was a teacher, attended. From the priesthood of the Christian Community, Emil Bock attended. Frau Lili Kolisko, founder of the Goetheanum Research Institute came a few days. 53 Together with the members of the Dornach Vorstand, the doctors of the Arlesheim clinic, Dr. Julia Bort who later devoted herself entirely to special education wor k, attended the lectures. Altogether there were about 20 people. (Strohschein, 1972/1998, p. 13) These lectures became the foundational knowledge for the practice of anthroposophic curative education. In the twenty -first century, Rudolf Steiner's The Curative Education Course continues to be studied in the training of anthroposophic curative education and social therapy. What Rudolf Steiner said about Kaspar Hauser Kaspar Hauser was not only an enigma of his time. He was also an enigma in the twentieth century and continues to be an enigma in the twenty -first century. With all the scholarship human beings have developed over the centuries, the mystery of Kaspar Hauser can still not be solved. In this chapter, I include what Rudolf Steiner was reported to have said about Kaspar Hauser. This effort is an attempt to understand Kaspar Hauser from the perspective of Anthroposophy. What Rudolf Steiner said can be used as a reference for further research. Rudolf Steiner had actually spoken about Kaspa r Hauser with the greatest reserve, and almost exclusively as a response to personal requests and in personal conversation. Rudolf Steiner 's reserve was striking and led K \u00f6nig to think that it indicated a reverent protection in view of an event whose dept h and tragedy had surely confronted the teacher of the spirit. (Selg, 2012, p. 48) Selg (2012) reported that when Rudolf Steiner was in Nuremberg for a lecture in 1908, one of the people he spoke to was Minna Rissmann. Her parents knew Georg Friedric Daumer. Steiner said to her that Kaspar Hauser was a \"'straggler from Atlantis'\" (p. 48). In Steiner's lecture on June 17, 1908, also in Nuremberg, Steiner spoke about \"Hauser's 'innate truthfulness' 54 and his extraordinary power of memory before intellectu al thinking began to pervade his existence\" (p. 48). In Nuremberg, Rudolf Steiner did not comment much more about Kaspar Hauser. He even asked people not to speak much of what they had just heard about Kaspar Hauser (p. 48). In An Outline of Esoteric Science, Rudolf Steiner (1997) wrote that Atlantis is an area that had existed in the prehistoric time between today's Europe, Africa, and America (p. 240). The description \"a straggler from Atlantis\" is not easy to understand. One of the explanations is summed up in Rudolf Steiner 's comment, \" innate truthfulness and his extraordinary power of memory before intellectual thinking began to pervade his existence \" (Selg, 2012, p. 48). Karl K\u00f6nig' s biographer and a medical doctor at a Camphill Community in Ger many, Hans M \u00fcller- Wiedemann, described the characteristics of Kaspar Hauser as follows: \"An 'ancient Atlantean heart quality' (Rudolf Steiner) was intended to counteract the onset of intellectualism and exaggerated consciousness of nationhood\" (M \u00fcller-Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 214). While intellect can discern truth from non -truth, it can also bring judgment and make people judgemental. The human heart can be non- judgemental and bring the power of love irrespective of people's background. It was such a power of love and heart forces that Kaspar Hauser brought to humanity. Countess Johanna Keyserlingk wrote down what Rudolf Steiner had said in Koberwitz on Whitsun in 1924 (Selg, 2012, p. 48). Koberwitz was part of Germany at that time. It is now part of Poland. Koberwitz was where Rudolf Steiner gave his lectures on The Agriculture Course from June 7 to 16 in 1924 (Steiner, 1958/2012, p. 7). June 8, 1924, was Whitsun that year (von Keyserlingk, 1974/2010, p. 64). Rudolf Steiner gave The Agricult ure Course just before The Curative Education Course , which was given from June 25 to July 7, 1924 (Steiner, 1972/1998). 55 The Curative Education Course was given around at the time of St. John's Day in the same year. St. John' s Day is on June 24 every year. Koberwitz was also close to Pilgramshain, Silesia, where Karl K \u00f6nig later began his curative education initiative (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 48). I will describe Karl K \u00f6nig' s curative education initiative in Pilgramshain in the chapter The Biography of Karl K\u00f6nig. Herr Winkler had asked Rudolf Steiner if he could tell anything about the previous incarnation of Caspar Hauser. Rudolf Steiner gave the answer the next day. He had made spiritual investigations at Caspar Hauser's birth place and at the place wher e he was murdered, but he had not been able to find either a previous or a subsequent incarnation. In this case, we are dealing with a higher being, who had a special mission on earth. (Keyserlingk, 1924, as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 280) Anthroposophy works with the view that human life has previous and successive lives on earth. A person's life is not limited to this one life but goes through reincarnation (Steiner, 1997, pp. 100-101). Therefore, Herr Winkler asked if Rudolf Steiner could sa y anything about the previous incarnation of Kaspar Hauser. Steiner did not find Kaspar Hauser's previous incarnation. What did this indicate? Steiner did make a statement, \"In this case, we are dealing with a higher being, who had a special mission on earth\" (Keyserlingk, 1924, as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 280). Not finding previous lives could also indicate this being had not experienced earthliness. This view supports why Kaspar Hauser was such a pure being. Three months later, at a Theological Course in Dornach in September 1924, to the priests of the Christian Community, Rudolf Steiner said, \"Kaspar Hauser was an angelic being\" (as cited 56 in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 282). In esoteric Christianity, angels are spiritual beings who stand one rank higher than human beings in the spiritual hierarchies (Steiner, 1960/2008, p. 33). Karl Heyer, who was a researcher of Kaspar Hauser, reported Rudolf Steiner had said, \"if Kaspar Hauser had not lived and died as he did, then the contact between the earth and the heavenly world would have been completely severed\" (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 282). This important statement by Rudolf Steiner would make Kaspar Hauser a human being who had a special mission on earth. It would mean that human beings of today can connect with the spiritual world because of how Kaspar Hauser lived and died. B\u00f6hmer (2019) wrote new information about this statement in his book Kaspar Hauser Child of Europe: An Artistic and Contemplative Approach to an Enduring Enigma. For a long time, the source of these words was not entirely known with certainty. We knew of it only through the work of Karl Heyer. But now a few years ago the source was found. The source is Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, who grew up in Nuremberg and emigrated to the U.S. at the end of the 1930s. (p. 77) Steiner and Pfeiffer conversed about this topic in 1924 (p. 77). It was the same year Rudolf Steiner gave The Curative Education Course . On March 3, 1925, Count Ludwig Polzer -Hoditz wrote down what Rudolf Steiner had said about Kaspar Hauser: Rudolf Steiner had said that the individuality that hid behind the veil of Kaspar Hauser is a being which has worked inspiringly into the Rosicrucian connection from the very start and then was incarnated on 29 September 1812 as the son of the Grand Duke Karl of Baden and his wife Stephanie de Beauharnais. Kaspar Hauser had an important mission 57 of esoteric Christianity to fulfill. (Polzer -Hoditz, 1925, as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, pp. 280-281) The word \"Rosicrucian\" means \"an adherent of a 17th and 18th century movement professing esoteric and occult wisdom with emphasis on mysticism and spiritual enlightenment\" (Merriam - Webs ter, n.d.b). The word could also mean \"a member of one of several organizations held to be descended from the Rosicrucians\" (Merriam -Webster, n.d.b). Four weeks after the above statement took place, Rudolf Steiner died (Selg, 2012, p. 50). Rudolf Steiner clearly stated that Kaspar Hauser was the son of the Grand Duke Karl of Baden and his wife, Stephanie de Beauharnais. As Selg (2012) reported, \"Steiner called upon Count Polzer -Hoditz to study the intentions associated with Kaspar Hauser's individuality and his historical tasks\" (p. 50). This conversation also took place four weeks before Steiner's death (p. 50). Conversations Rudolf Steiner made toward the end of his life can be seen as the last important messages he wanted to convey to humanity. Karl Heyer reported Rudolf Steiner had said, \"Alongside Christian Rosenkreutz, Kaspar Hauser is the on e who had the greatest understanding for the suffering of Christ\" (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 281). Steiner said (2001b) Christian Rosenkreutz founded the Rosicrucian Brotherhood (p. 1). Christian Rosenkreutz was not just \"in possession of Myster y- secrets, but even more that he is a key to the Christian understanding of them, in an apocalyptic context that points to a renewal of Christian teaching\" (pp. 3 -4). Kaspar Hauser developed a deep connection to Christ through Pastor Fuhrmann (Tradow sky, 1980/2012, p. 54). Kaspar Hauser's connection to the Christ Being had especially to do with the path of His suffering and pain (Selg, 2012, p. 50). Living confined in a dungeon 58 for many years attests to how much suffering Kaspar Hauser had experienced . Because he had suffered, he was able to understand suffering and love the world, as well. In 1916, notes taken by Count Ludwig Polzer -Hoditz reported what Rudolf Steiner had said in connection to Kaspar Hauser: Southern Germany should have become t he new Grail -Castle of the new Knights of the Grail and the cradle of future events. The spiritual background had been well prepared by all those personalities whom we know of as Goethe, Schiller, Holderlin, Herder and others. Kaspar Hauser was to have gat hered around him, as it were, all that existed in this spiritual ground thus prepared. (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, pp. 277-278) There are also reports that Rudolf Steiner said that the spiritual task of Central Europe is vital for the future of b oth the Eastern and Western world: He suggested trying to imagine what could have been and what ought to have been in history, and showed two remarkable personalities into whose hands, at least for a time, vital responsibilities had fallen. These were Bi smarck (1815 -1898) and Ferdinand von Lassalle (1825 -1864), one of the great social reformers of his age, who met an untimely death in a duel. Rudolf Steiner pointed out that if these two personalities could have worked together, as they were actually meant to do, and had been able to channel their powers and potential towards the only throne in Central Europe which might have given them the setting needed, and entirely different course of history would have been possible. (Heyer, 1958, as cited in Pietzner , 1983, pp. 7-8) Kaspar Hauser was supposed to be sitting on the throne, which Rudolf Steiner talked about (p. 8). Many of these sayings lead one to think that Kaspar Hauser had a special mission to fulfill on earth. 59 Europe in the Early Twentieth Century and Rudolf Steiner's Threefold Social Organism If Kaspar Hauser was the hereditary prince and had succeeded the throne of the House of Baden, how different could history have become? The development in Europe in the late nineteenth century and twenti eth century could have been very different. If a person of such moral character as Kaspar Hauser had succeeded the throne, it could be that World War I and World War II would have been avoided. Max von Baden As Boardman (2006) explained, Prince Max von Baden was one of the descendants of Grand Duke Leopold of the Hochberg line. Max von Baden was born in 1867 and died in 1929. Max von Baden was the last Chancellor of Imperial Germany at the end of World War I, from October 3, 1918, to November 9, 1918 (p. 166). If Kaspar Hauser had been the hereditary prince and succeeded the throne of the House of Baden, in that case, Kaspar Hauser's grandchild could have become the Chancellor of Imperial Germany in the twentieth century. [Max von Baden] was the man in high office on whom Rudolf Steiner placed his last hopes of bringing the Threefold Social Order before the world in the name of Germany to stand as a spiritual response to the barren abstractions of Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points. Rudolf Steiner had had two c onversations with Prince Max in 1918, one in Karlsruhe and one in Berlin. The Prince's freedom to represent the Threefold Social Order could not be compromised by having all kinds of things said in public about his abused ancestor Kaspar Hauser. As it was, to Rudolf Steiner's very great disappointment, Prince Max failed to present the Threefold Social Order ideas to the world and instead, agreed to an armistice on the basis of the 14 points. (p. 166) 60 Rudolf Steiner's wish to bring social renewal in Eu rope after World War I through developing the Threefold Social Organism was hampered by the descendent of the Hochberg line. If Kaspar Hauser had succeeded the throne and his grandson was in the position of the Chancellor, Rudolf Steiner's attempt to bring the Threefold Social Organism could have been accepted, and the world could have avoided World War II. Karl K \u00f6nig actively worked with the Threefold Social Organism in the Camphill Community. Karl K \u00f6nig (1986/2009a) spoke about the Threefold Soc ial Organism in his lecture series called The Camphill Village Conference. The title of the book is now called Seeds for Social Renewal. Rudolf Steiner developed his idea of the Threefold Social Organism after the First World War when many people wrestle with the riddle of how best to organize human society. The core concept recognizes the three domains of human social activity: economic, l egal and cultural. Steiner maintained that the health of human society depended on an adult population that understood the characteristics of each domain and could thereby organize society so that each domain enjoyed independence and autonomy. (p. 278) Rudolf Steiner had mentioned the ideals of how the three domains should work. In the following quote, Steiner used the term \" the spiritual and judicial domain, the domain of religion, education and jurisprudence \" for what K \u00f6nig referred to as \" cultural. \" Steiner used \" administration \" for what K\u00f6nig called \" legal. \" Both Steiner and K \u00f6nig used the word \" economic\" for the third sphere. There must be Liberty in the spiritual and judicial domain, the domain of religion, education and jurisprudence. There must be Equality in the administration, in the 61 government, the services of public security. There must be Fraternity in the economic domain. (Steiner, 1918, as cited in Lamb & Hearn, 2014, p. 53) Such a worldview Steiner wanted to bring after World War I. The Acc eptance of Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points On October 5, Max von Baden accepted Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points. It was two days after he became the Chancellor. The monarchy in Germany came to an end on November 9 when the Kaiser was abdicated. Max von Baden h imself also resigned the next day. Another person from Baden, Friedrich Ebert, succeeded the office, and he eventually became the first President of the Weimar Republic in February 1919 (Boardman, 2006, p. 25). After accepting Woodrow Wilson's 14 Points and its practice failed, the world began to walk toward the tragedy of World War II. Aspects of Kaspar Hauser's impulse was to bring about brotherhood and sisterhood of humanity, \"[the] flower with the radiance of freedom in their thoughts, each live with equal acceptance of one another and pulsing with the fraternal blood of the brotherhood\" (Pietzner, 1983, 6. 690-693). Such a social development could have happened in the twentieth cent ury through the descendent of the Baden dynasty and through Rudolf Steiner. Unfortunately, the development did not take place on the world stage. Biographic Rhythms I would like to present the biography of Karl K \u00f6nig, and later the spiritual relatio nship Karl K \u00f6nig had with Kaspar Hauser. Before I do that, I would like to explain how I included planetary rhythms as part of ways to look at different stages of biography. Planetary rhythms also influence social developments. I used this method as an at tempt to have a comprehensive understanding of biography and social developments. 62 This approach will help understand the deeper layers of Karl K \u00f6nig' s biography. It will help understand how K \u00f6nig's life, Kaspar Hauser 's influence on the development of anthroposophic healing education, and world events were interrelated. George and Gisela O'Neil (1990) have done research on the topic of biography. Their research is written in the book The Human Life . They explain this subject in the following way. It is the Initiate's view of these cycles of life that can throw light on the mysteries we so unknowingly live through. With its help we can come to picture ourselves the interplay of the planetary and hierarchical forces at work. (p. 100) William Bryant (1993/2018) explains how biographic rhythms have a relationship to the cosmos in his book The Veiled Pulse of Time . The imagery and perception behind myths and legend picture the human being as the child of cosmic life. Myths show us that the human mind once experienced life and its cycles as an integral part of the cosmic clock. If the individual is a microcosm, we should be able to detect a numerical correspondence between our personal rhythms and the cosmic cycles. (p. 20) Bryant also explain s how such cosmic rhythms can influence social development. \"Cosmic rhythms regulate everything from the passage of world ages and the ebb and flow of civilizations\" (p. 21). I will make explanations each time I introduce a new rhythm. The Biography of Karl K \u00f6nig Karl K\u00f6nig 's Upbringing Karl K \u00f6nig was born on September 25, 1902, in Vienna, Austria. His parents ran a shoe shop (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 44). He was born in a Jewish family (M \u00fcller- Wiedemann, 63 1992/1996, p. 13). At the age of thirteen, he experienced Jewish bar mitzvah. By then, however, he was already interested in Christianity (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 45). World War I started on July 28, 1914 (Woolf, 2008, p. 245). Karl K \u00f6nig was twelve years old at that time, almost thirteen. Karl K \u00f6nig was very aware of the level of des truction the world was going through during the war. Being an adolescent during the time, he could not bear the suffering people were experiencing. His mother once wrote how much pain Karl K \u00f6nig was carrying on his shoulder for the entire world (Lindenber g, 2004, p. 45). When Rudolf Steiner presented the idea of the Threefold Social Organism to Max von Baden in 1918, Karl K \u00f6nig was sixteen. At that time, Karl K \u00f6nig did not know anything about Rudolf Steiner. World War I ended in 1918. Karl K \u00f6nig was twelve to sixteen years old during the war. The four years during the war were a challenging time for everyone. Spending adolescent years during such a time undoubtedly must have influenced Karl K \u00f6nig on what he wanted to do for his life. Studying Me dicine and the First Moon- Node K\u00f6nig encountered Rudolf Steiner 's work for the first time in 1921 through other students (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 46). Karl K \u00f6nig was about nineteen years old. When Karl Konig met Rudolf Steiner 's work, the biographic phase approximately corresponded to K \u00f6nig's first Moon- node. According to O'Neil (1990), the Moon- nodes, the cycle of 18.6 years, have to do with the position of the Moon. Every 18.6 years, the Moon returns to the same position as when the person is born. The cycle takes place at the ages of 18.6, 37.2, 55.8, and 74.4. Each Moon- node can \"bring about within us, each according to his individual rhythm, the opportunity for great 64 changes and awakenings in life. . . . In these crucial years, for a short time our nights are enriched, new impulses are stirring, guidance is at work\" (pp. 176-177). Karl K \u00f6nig never met Rudolf Steiner personally. Rudolf Steiner was at the East -West Congress in Vienna in June 1922, but Karl K \u00f6nig did not attend this event. This opportunity was the only realistic chance for Karl K \u00f6nig to meet Steiner, but the meeting did not happen (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 46). He would encounter Steiner's work for the first time around at his first Moon -node through study instead. M\u00fcller-Weidemann (1992/1996) told that Karl K \u00f6nig began studying medicine in 1920 at the University of Vienna (p. 31). When he started to study medicine corresponded to his first Moon- node, as well. Medicine certainly was his life' s path. He involved himself w ith the Embryological Institute of Vienna for three years (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 46). He finished medical school in April 1927, when he was twenty- four years old (M \u00fcller- Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 31). Jupiter -Return Finishing medical school and taking the next step in his life corresponded to Karl K \u00f6nig's Jupiter -return. Jupiter -return indicates the planet Jupiter's return to the same position as that at the time of birth. It takes approximately 11.86 years for Jupiter to return to the same position (\"Jupiter,\" 2021). Bryant (1993/2018) tells that the cycle of Jupiter can be considered as twelve years (p. 137). The Jupiter cycle can be \"best described as a vocational rhythm, that marks phases of scientific, artistic, or philosophical activity, the mat uring of ideas, spans of personal relationship, and even the stroke of good fortune that punctuate the path through life \" (p. 137). The first Jupiter- return took place in Karl K \u00f6nig' s biography when he was around twelve years old. This was when World War I started. 65 Dr. Ita Wegman visited Vienna in October 1927 (M \u00fcller-Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 65). This opportunity was when Karl K \u00f6nig met Dr. Ita Wegman, who was the leader of the Medical Section of the School of Spiritual Science in Dornach, Switze rland, for the first time. Ita Wegman invited Karl K \u00f6nig to work at her clinic in Arlesheim in autumn 1927 (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 47). After this meeting, Dr. Ita Wegman became an important figure and a mentor for Karl K \u00f6nig. Karl K\u00f6nig 's Experience at t he Advent Garden in 1927; Waking up to His Calling to Work with the People with Special Needs \"It is important to note that Ita Wegman was one of the pioneers of anthroposophic curative education, as well as a medical doctor\" (Steel, personal commun ication, November 4, 2018). As mentioned before, by 1924, Ita Wegman had started a small initiative for children with special needs Die Holle in response to parents who brought children with special needs (Strohschein, 1972/1998, p. 11). K\u00f6nig (2018) reported that as he arrived in Arlesheim, he worked at the clinic 's research laboratory. He also worked at Sonnenhof, which was a home for children with special needs (p. 49). Karl K \u00f6nig then described the experience of attending the first Advent Sunday celebration in Sonnenhof in the following way: On the first Advent Sunday, I had the unique experience of the Advent garden festival. Never before had I ever heard anything about Advent; at that time, it was an unknown festival in Austria. But now I saw m yself sitting in a circle with my children and their helpers. In the center of the room there was a little mound built up of earth and covered with moss and on top of it stood a large burning candle. Around the mound, a spiral of moss had been laid out, re aching far into the room; it almost touched the circle of 66 children. Each child holding in its hand an apple into which a small candle was fixed, had to walk along the spiral to light its own candle at the central candle on the hill. (p. 50) This Advent garden experience became a crucial moment in Karl K \u00f6nig' s life. Karl K\u00f6nig later wrote that he had made the decision to work with people with special needs when he experienced the Advent festival and saw the children with special needs walk t he spiral Advent garden that evening. In this hour, I made the decision to dedicate my life to the care and education of these children. It was a promise I made to myself; to build a hill upon which a big candle was to burn so that many infirm and handicapped children would be able to find their way to this beacon of hope, and to light their own candles, so that each single flame would be able to radiate and shine forth. (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 47) Meeting His Spouse To Be In November 1927, another important development took place in Karl K \u00f6nig' s life. This experience happened just before he attended the Advent celebration in Sonnenhof. \"On the day of my arrival in Arlesheim on 7th November 1927 another person also made her appearance; and the clin ic allocated her an attic room in the same house in which I was staying. This was Tilla Maasberg \" (M \u00fcller- Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 81). Karl K \u00f6nig met the person who would eventually become his spouse on the same day he arrived in Arlesheim. Anthroposophic Curative Home in Pilgramshain in Silesia According to M \u00fcller- Wiedemann (1992/1996), \" Tilla Maasberg 's sister Maria had shortly before founded a small curative institute in the Eulengebirge (Eulen mountains) in Silesia\" (p. 81). Silesia was at that time in the northeastern part of Germany. It is mostly part of Poland today. Small parts are part of the Czech Republic and Germany. Albrecht Strohschein, 67 who attended Rudolf Steiner 's The Curative Education Course , joined Maria 's initiative (p. 81). Tilla Maasberg went back home to Silesia after Christmas. At this time, Karl K \u00f6nig wrote as follows: Unfortunately she had to break off her training prematurely and return to Silesia after Christmas. The work at home demanded her help. However, she also had a sister who was seriously ill to whom she very much wished I might give some medical advice. I would at the same time also be able to see her home and get to know the work that was being done there. (as cited in M \u00fcller- Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 82) This is how Karl K \u00f6nig visited Silesia for the first time. He started to work as a doctor in Silesia in autumn 1928. Eventually Karl K \u00f6nig and Tilla Maasberg became married on May 5th, 1929 (M\u00fcller-Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 81, 89). After Karl K \u00f6nig arrived in Silesia and familiarized himself with the curative education work there, Karl K \u00f6nig and hi s wife began a curative home in Pilgramshain, in Silesia. For seven years, they worked there (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 48). \" Karl K \u00f6nig was one of the pioneers of anthroposophic curative education. The initiative in Pilgramshain attests to it\" (Steel, persona l communication, November 4, 2018). In Silesia, Karl K \u00f6nig worked with Albrecht Strohschein, one of the people who had attended Rudolf Steiner 's lectures, The Curative Education Course . One could say that through Karl K \u00f6nig' s connection with Albr echt Strohschein, the thread of K \u00f6nig' s connection to anthroposophic curative education went back to Rudolf Steiner's The Curative Education Course. The Political Development in Germany 68 After World War I, many people in Germany lived in discontentm ent and social turmoil. During such a challenging social climate, the Nazi Party took control of the political power in 1933. The Nazi regime suppressed democracy. The party now had control of the entire nation. The government worked toward rebuilding the German military, as well (Woolf, 2008, p. 249). Saturn- Return Karl K \u00f6nig was thirty years old when the Nazi party took over power in 1933. When Adolf Hitler became Chancellor in 1933, the time corresponded to Karl K \u00f6nig' s Saturn -return cycle. Brya nt (1993/2018) tells that \"the sidereal period of the planet is twenty -nine years and 168 days\" (p. 97). Saturn -return means planet Saturn returns to the same position as to where it was at the time of birth. One can look at the 29.5 -year Saturn cycle as a 30 -year cycle, also. \"The thirty -year rhythm in human biography can reasonably be called the 'Saturn Cycle'\" (p. 97). \"The Saturn cycles are often the most dramatic of biographic cycles\" (p. 97). In our thirtieth and sixtieth years, we experience \" crucia l incidents or a change of pace, direction, and emphasis \" (p. 97). At such a crucial biographic stage for Karl K \u00f6nig in 1933, one of the darkest periods of the twentieth century began in Germany. The Thirty -Three Years Cycle As the Nazi regime took over Germany' s political power, safety at the initiative in Pilgramshain became doubtful. When Karl K \u00f6nig was thirty- three years old, he left Germany and went back to Austria (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 49). Karl K \u00f6nig, Tilla K \u00f6nig, and their three children departed Silesia on March 7, 1936 (M \u00fcller-Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 105). George and Gisela O'Neil (1990) wrote about the biographic phase of thirty- three years in the following way: 69 The Soul partakes in both in a twice opposite way. For Body and Spirit, the gates of birth and death are at the periphery, at the beginning and at the end of biography. For the Soul they are in the center of biography, in the mid- years- turned outside inward. The Soul does not fully awake to her potential Self until she \" dies;\" she does not fully become an individual Self until she is \"born\" through the life -crisis at 33, when the two gates are one for the life of the Soul. (p. 223) One could summarize that age thirty -three is a window in the middle of life when deat h and rebirth meet in the soul life. Robert Powell (1996), who is a researcher of Anthroposophy, talked about the life span of Christ Jesus out of his research as follows. \"The exact length of the life of Christ Jesus from birth to the resurrection was 33 years less than 1 \u00bd days\" (p. 415). Meeting a Group of People in Vienna Karl K \u00f6nig and Tilla K \u00f6nig spent two years in Vienna, Austria, between 1936 to 1938. In these two years, a group of young people came together around Karl K \u00f6nig for studies and discussions. Many of them had a Jewish background, including Karl K \u00f6nig himself. The political pressure they had to live with was tremendous. Although the political situation was unfavorable, this group of people gathered around Karl K \u00f6nig with enthusiasm in their hearts for the future (Lindenberg, 2004, pp. 49-50). As Germany invaded Austria in 1938, Karl K \u00f6nig and the group left the country. They decided to look for a new place where they could realize their ideal: to establish a curative education practice to work with people with special needs. They left Vienna on March 11, 1938 (Linderberg, 2004, pp. 49-50). Karl K \u00f6nig was thirty -five years old. Kirkton House and the Third Jupiter -Return 70 Although many people among the youth group le ft Austria separately, they all found their way to Scotland. According to Bock (1990), one by one, they reached a house called Kirkton House, near Insch, Aberdeenshire (p. 36). At Kirkton House, they planned to create a home for children with special needs (pp. 36- 38). On May 28, 1939, the opening ceremony took place at Kirkton House (p. 38). Karl K \u00f6nig was thirty -six years old. Anke Weihs, who was also one of the founders of the Camphill Community, wrote about the opening ceremony: May 28 was Whit Sunday, one hundred and eleven years and two days after Caspar Hauser's sudden appearance in the streets of Nurenberg [ sic]. Six Children and fifteen adults gathered in Kirkton House for its dedication to the task of Curative Education. (as cited in Baum, 2004, p. 33) This writing tells Anke Weihs was also very aware that their work in Scotland had a relationship to the life of Kaspar Hauser. As mentioned, Karl K \u00f6nig was thirty- six years old. Karl K \u00f6nig began the initiative at Kirkton House at his third twelve -year cycle, his third Jupiter -return. Internment at the Isle of Man In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland and World War II began (Woolf, 2008, pp. 252-253). As the war escalated, on Whitsunday 1940, one year after the opening of Kirkton House, the men of the group, including Karl K \u00f6nig, were interned as enemy aliens t o the Isle of Man. The women kept the curative education work going at Kirkton House (K \u00f6nig, 2018, p. 16). The Birth of the Camphill Community While the men of the group were interned for six months, the women of the group moved into Camphill Hous e. Camphill House was close to Aberdeen (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 51). 71 Camphill House was a larger estate than Kirkton House (Bock, 1983, p. 39). They moved in on June 1, 1940. This day was when the new initiative to work with people with special needs, the Camphill Community, was born (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 51). Karl K \u00f6nig was released from internment on October 4, 1940, and joined the group in Camphill (K \u00f6nig, 2018, p. 70). Since then, until his death in 1966, Karl K \u00f6nig dedicated his life to working with people with special needs in the Camphill Community. The Camphill Community became an international movement for people with special needs afterward (Lindenberg, 2004, p. 39). Karl K\u00f6nig and Kaspar Hauser Part I Karl K \u00f6nig contributed much to the development of anthroposophic curative education and social therapy. In December 1927, Karl K \u00f6nig went to Sonnenhof in Arlesheim. As he experienced the Advent garden there, he realized that the purpose of his life was t o dedicate himself for the care of people with special needs. 1927 was only three years after Rudolf Steiner had given The Curative Education Course in 1924 in Dornach, Switzerland. K\u00f6nig' s contribution as one of the pioneers of anthroposophic cura tive education and social therapy can be seen from his work at the curative home in Pilgramshain, Silesia, from 1927 to 1936. Then he developed his work at Camphill Communities from 1939, including the year at Kirkton House, until the end of his life in 1966. Christof -Andreas Lindenberg is a music therapist, who worked at the Camphill Community in Scotland, Ireland, and at The Camphill School in Pennsylvania (Bock, 2004, p. 307). Lindenberg (2004) described Karl K \u00f6nig' s life as follows: During the p eriod of twenty- seven years from 1939 to 1966, the life of Karl K \u00f6nig and 72 the unfolding and growth of Camphill is so interlinked as to be one story. To tell this part of K\u00f6nig' s biography is to relate the birth of a worldwide movement of homes, schools, and villages on four continents; the manifestation of an impulse . (p. 39) The work at Camphill Communities worldwide continues to be a significant initiative where anthroposophic curative education and social therapy is practiced. Karl K \u00f6nig' s contr ibution to anthroposophic curative education and social therapy can be experienced even today in the twenty- first century through the Camphill Communities. Through Karl K \u00f6nig' s connection to Albrecht Strohschein and Dr. Ita Wegman, the thread of K \u00f6nig' s connection to anthroposophic curative education could be traced back to 1924 when The Curative Education Course was given. Tracing history backward, through the work of Camphill Communities today, through studying how Camphill Communities developed since its beginning in 1940, through studying the life of Karl K \u00f6nig and his connection to Albrecht Strohschein and Ita Wegman, those who work in Camphill Communities in the twenty- first century can still discover the thread to the original The Curati ve Education Course given by Rudolf Steiner in 1924. \"Karl K \u00f6nig had for many years studied the figure of Kaspar Hauser \" (Selg, 2012, p. 32). Karl K \u00f6nig had a strong spiritual connection to Kaspar Hauser. The figure of Kaspar Hauser lived very close to Karl K \u00f6nig' s heart throughout the time the Camphill Co mmunity developed. Karl K \u00f6nig studied Kaspar Hauser from the beginning of his involvement with curative education in Pilgramshain. Richard Steel has worked in Camphill Communities for many years. He is the co- founder of the Karl K \u00f6nig Institute a nd a member of the Kaspar Hauser Research Circle in Berlin, 73 Germany (Kaspar Hauser Research Circle, n.d.b). The Kaspar Hauser Research Circle became part of the Karl K \u00f6nig Institute in 2016 (Kaspar Hauser Research Circle, n.d.c). Peter Selg is a pro fessor of medicine and is the director of the Ita Wegman Institute for Basic Research into Anthroposophy in Arlesheim, Switzerland. He is also a professor at the Alanus University for Arts and Social Sciences (Selg, 2016). Richard Steel and Peter Sel g have edited, written, and published a book Kaspar Hauser and Karl K \u00f6nig, in 2012. In the book, Peter Selg (2012) has written as follows. \"[ For Karl K\u00f6nig,] the figure of Kaspar Hauser played a large, even a central role from the outset \" (pp. 34- 35). In this chapter, I explored Karl K \u00f6nig's spiritual connection to Kaspar Hauser. \" It was in the realm of the heart and the matters of the heart that Karl K \u00f6nig had an affinity with Kaspar \" (Steel, 2012, p. 137). Karl K \u00f6nig' s connection to Kaspar Hau ser was an essential part of the development of the Camphill Community. One could identify Karl K \u00f6nig's deep relationship with Kaspar Hauser at different stages of K \u00f6nig' s biographic developments. In the Camphill Community, Kaspar Hauser became a spiritu al guide for anthroposophic healing education. Margrit Metraux has worked and has been living in Camphill Communities in Britain, South Africa, and the USA for over 65 years. She shared a story about how she experienced Kaspar Hauser in Camphill fo r the first time. \"When I went to the Camphill Community near Bristol in the 1950s, one of the first books I encountered was Jakob Wassermann's (1928/2012) Caspar Hauser: Inertia of the Heart . I was recommended to read it\" (Metraux, personal communication, March 31, 2021). Such a story shows how deeply Kaspar Hauser was living in Camphill from the early years. Karl K\u00f6nig 's Conversation with Dr. Eugen Kolisko 74 Karl K \u00f6nig and Dr. Eugen Kolisko had a conversation about Kaspar Hauser in the spring of 1934 in Pilgramshain, Silesia (Selg, 2012, pp. 32-33). Karl K \u00f6nig went to Silesia for the first time in 1928. Dr. Eugen Kolisko was a curative educator and a physician at the Waldorf School in Stuttgart (Strohschein, 1972/1998, p. 13). He was one of the participants when Rudolf Steiner gave his lectures of The Curative Education Course in 1924. K \u00f6nig' s connection to The Curative Education Course could be traced back through his connection to Dr. Eugene Kolisko, also. Karl K\u00f6nig recorded the conve rsation in the following way. From a conversation with Dr. Kolisko. Kaspar Hauser: he is a personality who has never been incarnated before, The Child of Europe. Brought into the world as a Mercury impulse against the Mars impulse of Napoleon. Incarnates i n Napoleon's family in Baden. Is murdered, probably by the same people who brought him up. Brings the impulse of curative education into the world. (as cited in Selg, 2012, p. 32) According to Bittleston (1951/1985), Mercury impulse means healing imp ulse (p. 42). Mars impulse means impulse toward conflict (p. 34). K \u00f6nig' s comment, \" who has never been incarnated before, \" requires elaborate studies to understand. Karl K \u00f6nig' s statement is related to the statement by Rudolf Steiner. Keyserlingk (1924) reported that \"[Rudolf Steiner] had not been able to find either a previous or a subsequent incarnation [of Kaspar Hauser]\" (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 280). Rudolf Steiner then said, \"In this case we are dealing with a higher being, who had a special mission on earth\" (Keyserl ingk, 1924, as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 280). Another aspect was that if Kaspar Hauser had never incarnated before, he had no earthliness and could explain why he was a pure being. Karl K \u00f6nig stated that \"[Kaspar 75 Hauser] brings the impulse of cur ative education into the world\" (as cited in Selg, 2012, p. 32). The healing impulse of Mercury is very much part of curative education. Karl K \u00f6nig recognized that such a healing impulse originated from Kaspar Hauser. Karl K \u00f6nig and Eugen Kolisko had the conversation about Kaspar Hauser in the spring of 1934, when one hundred years had just passed since Kaspar Hauser's death in 1833 (Selg, 2012, p. 51). It was also one year after Adolf Hitler took over political power in Germany. This political deve lopment in Germany could be seen as another picture of how Kaspar Hauser was possibly bringing \"Mercury impulse against the Mars impulse \" of Hitler. Before Eugen Kolisko's death, he gave a lecture called \"The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser\" in February 1935. No note or draft is kept from this lecture. This lecture was the last talk he gave at the Goetheanum (Selg, 2012, p. 34). Such a fact showed that Eugen Kolisko also had a deep spiritual connection to Kaspar Hauser. In 1936, Karl K \u00f6nig returned to Vienna (Selg, 2012, p. 34). In March 1938, he departed Vienna and went to Scotland. In May 1939, the curative education initiative in Kirkton House began. The Lecture at Heathcot on February 25, 1940 On February 25, 1940, Karl K \u00f6nig gave a lecture and spoke about the spiritual ideals of the new initiative they wished to begin in Scotland (Selg, 2012, p. 35). As mentioned, the Camphill Community was founded on June 1, 1940. Karl K \u00f6nig' s lecture took place about three months before the founding. Kaspar Hauser, 1828: The Beginning of Curative Education He gave the lecture in Heathcot. This was on the other side of River Dee, from where they would find the Camphill Community later the year (Selg, 2012, p. 35). The lecture took 76 place before the men of the group were interned at the Isle of Man as enemy ali ens. Curative education was still practiced at Kirkton House. Karl K \u00f6nig was thirty -seven years old. In this public lecture, Karl K \u00f6nig spoke about the appearance of Kaspar Hauser as the beginning of curative education (as cited in Selg, 2012, p. 37). In his preparatory notes, K \u00f6nig wrote \" Kaspar Hauser. 1828, Daumer, L. Stanhope / The beginning of curative education\" (as cited in Selg, 2012, p. 35). \" K\u00f6nig wrote the names of Daumer, L. Stanhope on the side \" (Steel, personal communication, November 4, 2018). Therefore, what was written on the top of the notes was \" Kaspar Hauser. 1828 / The beginning of curative education\" (K\u00f6nig, 1940). What K\u00f6nig wanted to emphasize was that the appearance of Kaspar Hauser in 1828 marked the beginning of new curative education. The Faith in the Eternal Spirit in Every Human Being According to Selg (2012) Karl K \u00f6nig's notes also gave the following information. \" R. St [Rudolf Steiner] built up a new form of c.e. [curative education] out of his whole view of the world\" (p. 35). What is different in our methods from the other ones? The imagination of the human being. The backward and defective children, they are not inferior human beings. They are only in their manifestations different from the normal way and the kind of behaviour. (p. 35) The practice at the new initiative in Scotland would have \"the faith in the eternal spirit in every human being\" (p. 36). Karl K \u00f6nig (2018) characterized the view of the human being in the following way at a differen t occasion. 77 The child, whatever his mental condition may be, is more than his physical appearance may indicate. He is more than his body, more than his emotions, more than his spoken or unspoken words. He is more than his achievements. In his appearance he is merely the outer shell of an infinite and eternal spiritual being. (p. 130) To have \"faith in the eternal spirit in every human being\" regardless of ability or disability is an essential part of anthroposophic curative education and social therapy. The practice has its foundation on the view of the human being Rudolf Steiner gave in Anthroposophy. Working out of this \" imagination of the human being\" alone has tremendous potential for healing education. As mentioned in an earlier chapter, Rudolf Steiner (1961/1994) wrote in his book Theosophy , \"Within the human soul, the 'I' flashes up, receives the impact of the spirit\" (p. 58). Recognition of each individual, and each individual as a spiritual being, is an essential part of a human being's experience of healing. In Darwinism, the human being was merely viewed as an existence that \"evolved from apelike ancestors\" (Woolf, 2008, p. 243). No \"faith in the eternal spirit in every human being\" existed in the most prevalent scientific views in the late ni neteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century. The Outbreak of World War II Even darker times were still coming in Europe and in the entire world. On September 1, 1939, World War II began when Germany invaded Poland, and Britain and France declared war on Germany. K \u00f6nig spoke in Heathcot while these children of special needs were being systematically murdered in Germany under the Nazi regime. (Selg, 2012, p. 37) 78 While the war was raging in the European continent, in Scotland, Karl K \u00f6nig tried to build a place of healing peace for people with special needs. The Camphill Community was to become a shining light in the increasingly dark world. Kaspar Ha user Illumined the Beginning of Curative Education Like a Transfiguration on the Mountain Top On another occasion, K \u00f6nig stated, \"Kaspar Hauser ' illumined' the beginning of curative education ' like a transfiguration on the mountain top'\" (as cited i n Selg, 2012, p. 37). For Karl K\u00f6nig, the appearance of Kaspar Hauser in Nuremberg in 1828 was the transformed new development of curative education. How could one understand such a description by Karl K \u00f6nig? Let us remember that Rudolf Steiner ha d said, \"If Kaspar Hauser had not lived and died as he did, then the contact between the earth and the heavenly world would have severed\" (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 282). Kaspar Hauser's appearance maintained the spiritual light for human beings and brought new light for people with special needs as spiritual beings. Kaspar Hauser represented a new understanding of a person with special needs as a spiritual being. Karl K \u00f6nig' s enthusiasm and commitment to working with people with speci al needs were evident in these lectures. Kaspar Hauser was a guiding star of this new initiative of healing education from its beginning. Karl K\u00f6nig 's Second Moon -Node When Karl K \u00f6nig gave the lecture at Heathcot, when he was interned for six mont hs and when the Camphill Community began, all these events took place around at the second Moon- node in Karl K \u00f6nig' s biography. O 'Neil (1995) says, \"at the second moon- node of 37 years and two months, some realization of the significance of one's present incarnation may dawn\" (p. 79 178). \"A change of locality, of work, of career, even of lifestyle is frequent. The possibility of rebirth, of new impulse , new directions; this is gleaned from the biographies of those who have gone through this crucial period\" (pp. 178-179). For Karl K \u00f6nig, the significance of his life became manifest around his second Moon -node: he founded the Camphill Community. Karl K\u00f6nig' s life became completely intertwined with the destiny of the Camphill Community. 1943: The Death of Ita Wegman and The First Moon -Node Since the Curative Education Course was Given As Selg (2012) wrote, 1943 was a significant year for Karl K \u00f6nig. The year marked the first Moon -node since Rudolf Steiner gave The Curative Education Course in 1924. Karl K\u00f6nig planned a festive celebration including a number of lectures for this special moment (p. 65). The celebration took place from February 3rd to 14th, 1943 (p. 109). Less than one month after the celebration, Karl K \u00f6nig received sad news from the continent. Ita Wegman had passed away on March 4, 1943, in the morning in Arlesheim (Selg, 2012, p. 51). The death of Ita Wegman shocked Karl K \u00f6nig. One could imagine how devastated Karl K \u00f6nig must have been, considering Ita Wegman had lived as a mentor for Karl K \u00f6nig. Karl K\u00f6nig spoke about Ita Wegman' s passing in the following ways. \" To me, it is as though a vital nerve has been severed within me. It seems inconceivable that I shall never see her here on earth again. How empty it has suddenly become around me \" (as cited in M\u00fcller- Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 207). K \u00f6nig (2012b) also said, \"Who will lead us now? Does it not seem as if everything within our movement has gone to pieces? Who will carry the chalice when Dr. Wegman is not there anymore\" (p p. 83-84)? 80 Karl K \u00f6nig lived with a tremendous feeling of loss. He also expressed his concerns about how the work of anthroposophic curative education and social therapy could continue into the future without Ita Wegman. Placing Ita Wegman's Portrait Besides the Portrait of Kaspar Hauser As K\u00f6nig heard of Ita Wegman' s passing, \" K\u00f6nig placed Ita Wegman 's portrait beside that of Kaspar Hauser, which had already been standing on his writing desk for a long time \" (M\u00fcller-Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 207). Karl K \u00f6nig wrote \" a kind of Requiem \" for Ita Wegman. As part of the writing, Karl K \u00f6nig (2012b) wrote as follows: As a form of Requiem for Frau Dr. Wegman, I would like to express what has lived in my soul in re cent months, what continues to live in me and feels deeply united with the being of Kaspar Hauser. Two pictures are now placed upon my desk: one which has already been there for several months, portrays the Child of Europe. The other picture placed beside it just yesterday is the picture of Dr. Ita Wegman. May all that I have pondered and thought about Kaspar Hauser be offered to her in loving gratitude. This child Kaspar wanted to bring peace from out of the Mercury impulse of Buddha and was ridicul ed and ultimately murdered by the adversary forces. She, too, was patient and calm, because she bore the new staff of Mercury \u2014the sign of healing peace. (p. 84) What Karl K \u00f6nig meant about \" the Mercury impulse of Buddha \" could be explained in the fo llowing way by the words of Rudolf Steiner (1961/1968). \"Mercury has always been regarded as the symbol of Buddhism\" (p. 154). \"Buddha stands for Mercury and Mercury for Buddha\" (p. 154). The teaching of Buddha can be seen as a practice to bring healing, peace, and compassion. Kaspar Hauser's task was to bring healing, peace, and compassion to the world. 81 A Kind of Requiem The title of \" a kind of Requiem \" Karl K \u00f6nig wrote for Ita Wegman was Kaspar Hauser (K\u00f6nig, 2012b, p. 84). Kaspar Hauser can be found in the book Kaspar Hauser and Karl K \u00f6nig. \"It may seem surprising that K \u00f6nig dedicated his Kaspar Hauser studies to Ita Wegman. However, Ita Wegman had often spoken about Kaspar Hauser and the curative -educational impulse in Central Europe \" (M \u00fcller-Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 214). Out of K \u00f6nig' s deep relationship to Kaspar Hauser, he offered the requiem for Ita Wegman. Turning to Kaspar Hauser for this moment was also a response to the question Karl K\u00f6nig (2012b) had asked himself \" Who will lea d us now? Does it not seem as if everything within our movement has gone to pieces? Who will carry the chalice when Dr. Wegman is not there anymore \" (pp. 83- 84)? Karl K \u00f6nig' s answer was that it would be Kaspar Hauser who would lead anthroposophic curative education and social therapy into the future. When Ita Wegman passed away, the presence of Kaspar Hauser shone brighter to lead healing education. Kaspar Hauser as a Nathan -being Karl K \u00f6nig wrote Kaspar Hauser between March 5 and 8, 1943. Kaspar Hauser was composed of different elements, including numbers and history (Selg, 2012, p. 65). The writing was entirely based on Karl K \u00f6nig' s research on Kaspar Hauser. In one part of Kaspar Hauser , Karl K \u00f6nig made a statement about what he thought about the being of Kaspar Hauser. \" Kaspar Hauser was a Nathan -being. He was young, perhaps an angelic being, born for the first time, a bringer of the messenger of peace\" (K \u00f6nig, 2012b, p. 87). Karl K \u00f6nig was forty- one years old. He was on his way to becoming forty -two years old. George and Gisela O'Neil (1990) described the age between forty- two to forty -nine in their book. The human being in the forties can be full of ideas. \"Productivity, innovation, 82 imagination, and spiritual vigor are the signs. . . . During this time new opportunities open up, careers are reshaped; and in the personal life order begins to reign\" (p. 12). Karl K \u00f6nig developed these profound thoughts about Kaspar Hauser for Ita Wegman in 1943. In 1943, Europe was still in the midst of World War II. Battles were raging everywhere. Who was the Nathan -Being? Sergei Prokofieff was a Russian researcher of Anthroposophy. He was one of the founders of the Anthroposophical Society in Russia. He joined the Executive Council of the General Anthroposophical Society in Dornach, Switzerland, in 2001 (Prokofieff, 2012/2014). Sergei Prokofieff (2012/2014), wrote in his book And the Earth Becomes a Sun, \"The Nathan soul can be characterized as the being that bears and preserves within itself the primal substance of all human existence as it resided in the spiritual world before the Fall\" (p. 405). The Nathan- being and the Nathan soul are the same being. Prokofieff also spoke about the Nathan -being at the Michaelmas Conference in Dornach in 2009. \"We are concerned here with a paradisal being, with a pure human being\" (Prokofieff, 2010/2011, p. 27). Prokofieff's r esearch on the Nathan -being comes from the work of Rudolf Steiner. Rudolf Steiner's lecture about the Nathan -Jesus child is recorded in a lecture cycle, titled According to Luke: The Gospel of Compassion and Love Revealed: Where then, was the great enlivening power of the Jesus body to come from? It came from the great mother lodge of humanity, led by the great Sun initiate Manu. A great individual force, lavished with care and attention in the great mother lodge, was sent down into the child who was born to the couple the Luke Gospel calls Joseph and Mary. This child received the best and strongest of the individualities fostered by the Sun oracle. (Steiner, 1955/2001a, pp. 92-93) 83 \"The great mother lodge of humanity\" means the spiritual world before each i ndividual is born on earth. Steiner (1995/2001a) also said as follows. A certain portion of the ether body's forces were retained and not transmitted to Adam and Eve's descendants. This innocent part of Adam was preserved in the great mother lodge of humanity, where care and attention were lavished upon it. This aspect of Adam's soul had not been involved in events leading up to the Fall and was therefore untouched by human guilt. In it, the original forces of the Adam individuality were preserved. They were later guided into the child who was born to Joseph and Mary. (p. 93) According to Rudolf Steiner, the quality of the pure being that had lived as the first human being before the Fall also lived in the Nathan soul. This Nathan- being had never lived on earth until being born for the first time as Joseph and Mary's child (Prokofieff, 2012/2014, p. 405). \"In the infant son born to Joseph and Mary, the ancestral father of humanity, the 'old Adam' came to life as a 'new Adam'\" (Steiner, 1955/2001a, p. 94). In other words, Adam's pureness and innocence before the Fall was preserved in the spiritual world, and the being with the same pureness as Adam was born as the Nathan soul. How people perceived Kaspar Hauser when he appeared on the stree t in Nuremberg in 1828 was similar to how Rudolf Steiner characterized the Nathan- being. As reported by Selg (2012) the comment by Gottfried von Tucher, Kaspar Hauser's first guardian, attested to it. \"His natural purity and lack of self -consciousness, gav e one the most perfect impression of the first human being in paradise before the Fall.\" Anselm von Feuerbach said, \"Kaspar Hauser's appearance contradicted the doctrine of original sin.\" Georg Friedrich Daumer spoke of the 84 \"paradisal innocence and purity\" of Kaspar Hauser (p. 39). It was Kaspar Hauser's pureness and the innocence that people remember him for. The Nathan -Being, Kaspar Hauser, Healing and Healing Education Sergei Prokofieff (2010/2011) has done research on the Nathan soul and has spoke n about the being's significance for humanity on many different occasions. At the Michaelmas Conference at the Goetheanum in 2009, Prokofieff said, \"In the whole of human evolution there is no being who was, is, and will remain so deeply and intensely connected with the Christ both on the earth and in cosmos\" (p. 45). He further said, \"the Nathan soul still bears within himself today the healing forces that the Christ poured out over humanity\" (p. 48). Prokofieff attributed the Nathan soul's intimate connec tion with Christ in the past, present, and future for the healing of the world and for the development of love. In the same lecture, Prokofieff (2010/2011) also said, \"From the very beginning, the Nathan soul \u2014as the paradisal archetypal human being \u2014was and is the representative of unlimited health\" (p. 47). Although Prokofieff spoke the above statement in relation to being the inspirer of anthroposophical medicine in his lecture (p. 47), such a characterization of the Nathan soul would also directly m ean that the Nathan soul is a source of healing and anthroposophic healing education. Prokofieff said in the same lecture, \"We see how Christology, art, medicine, curative education, and pedagogy are realms in which this particular being can actively inspi re and help\" (p. 48). Prokofieff further spoke about the relationship between the Nathan soul and art. The Nathan soul was connected to \"the laying of the foundation stone of the First Goetheanum and its construction and thus with the whole artistic impuls e of anthroposophy\" (p. 48). 85 Karl K \u00f6nig (1961/2012a) recognized that Kaspar Hauser made \" lovely water -colors of flowers and fruits very delicately painted\" (p. 16). Others reported what genuine interest Kaspar Hauser developed in nature after learning about the process of the living world. \"Kaspar developed a very special relationship to flowers and learned to do beautiful watercolor flower paintings\" (Steuck, 2006, p. 23). Kaspar Hauser had a genuine relationship with the natural world and could express his experience of nature through art. His paintings were reflections of the pureness of Kaspar Hauser's experiences. Prokofieff (2010/2011) also spoke about the work of the Nathan soul in Waldorf education. The Nathan soul brought \"the pure archetypal image of the human being that everyone still represents \u2014but now only in very early childhood. . . . Only after the fourteenth year should the soul in its entirety be confronted with intellectual demands \u2014because prior to this age the child must be p rotected. This means there is a need to conserve the forces of the Nathan soul\" (pp. 45-46). The force of childhood is important for a healthy process of education. Such an approach touches \"not only on the innermost core of anthroposophical pedagogy but on the heart of anthroposophy itself\" (p. 46). He further said, \"We find that conscious relationship to this being proves to be an utter necessity in the fulfillment of our anthroposophical tasks\" (p. 48). The Child of Europe, Kaspar Hauser possessed a pure soul like that of a child. The qualities of pureness Kaspar Hauser carried were necessary for the healing of the world. Kaspar Hauser as a Pure Being Who Possessed Forces of Healing, Peace, and Compassion Kaspar Hauser possessed a pure soul, and was the source of healing, peace, and compassion. While the war was raging, and millions dying, people in Camphill found an antidote to battle. Karl K \u00f6nig felt united with Kaspar Hauser, and brought forth love for the people around him. When It a Wegman passed away, Karl K \u00f6nig could turn to Kaspar Hauser for 86 guidance. The being of Kaspar Hauser possessed the Mercury impulse of Buddha. Such an impulse for healing, peace, and compassion was what this pure soul was able to bring. Manifestation of such an impulse will take place many times during the development of the Camphill Community. The Mercury impulse of Buddha continues to be part of anthroposophic healing education in the twenty- first century. Analysis of Karl K\u00f6nig 's Writing about the Nat han- Being and Kaspar Hauser In Kaspar Hauser and Karl K \u00f6nig, Peter Selg (2012) wrote a few paragraphs that were his opinion and analysis of Karl K \u00f6nig' s writing about the Nathan soul and Kaspar Hauser. For Karl K \u00f6nig, Kaspar Hauser was likewise a Nathan being with a similar \u2014though in no way identical \u2014make up to the Jesus child described by St. Luke. Forces of childhood lived pre -eminently also in Hauser, the Child of Europe and a wholly exceptional quality of love and compassion. Like Jesus of N azareth he followed an innocent path of sacrifice, whose nature and significance K \u00f6nig sought consistently to illuminate. (pp. 43-44) Peter Selg 's description \" For Karl K \u00f6nig, Kaspar Hauser was likewise a Nathan -being with a similar\u2014though in no wa y identical \u2014make up to the Jesus child described by St. Luke \" best describes the relationship between Kaspar Hauser and the Nathan soul. Karl K \u00f6nig calling Kaspar Hauser \" a Nathan -being\" could be considered Karl K \u00f6nig' s characterization of Kaspar Hauser. It is a hypothesis. Karl K \u00f6nig did not mean Kaspar Hauser was identical to the Nathan - being. Whether Kaspar Hauser was identical to the Nathan -being is unknown. Kaspar Hauser, however, carried a pure soul. Let us remember what Sergei Prokofieff (2010/2011) had said. \"The Nathan soul still bears within himself today the healing forces that the Christ poured out over humanity\" (p. 48). As \"a Nathan- being\" and a carrier of pure soul, Kaspar Hauser carried forces of healing for humanity and for healing educat ion. 87 Many descriptions of Kaspar Hauser indicated Kaspar Hauser potentially being a special being. One must not forget how Countess Keyserlingk recorded what Rudolf Steiner had said. \"He [Rudolf Steiner] had not been able to find either a previous or a subsequent incarnation. In this case, we are dealing with a higher being, who had a special mission on earth\" (Keyserlingk, 1924, as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 280). Rudolf Steiner had also said, \"If Kaspar Hauser had not lived and died as he did, then the contact between the earth and the heavenly world would have been completely severed\" (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 282). To the circle of the priests of the Christian Community, Rudolf Steiner said that \"Kaspar Hauser is an angelic being\" (Tradowsky, p. 282). To Count Ludwig Polzer -Hoditz, Rudolf Steiner had said on March 3, 1925, \"The individuality that hid behind the veil of Kaspar Hauser is a being which has worked inspiringly into the Rosicrucian connection from the very s tart\" (Polzer - Hoditz, 1925, as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 281). Karl K \u00f6nig also said that \" he was young, perhaps an angelic being, born for the first time, a bringer of the messenger of peace \" (K\u00f6nig, 2012b, p. 87). Any of these statements would m ake Kaspar Hauser a special human being. The Death of People with Special Needs in Camphill Community Even after Ita Wegman's death in March, 1943 continued to be a challenging year in Camphill. A child died for the first time in Camphill at the beginning of April. Severe illnesses broke out several months later (Selg, 2012, p. 63). When several children, and a teacher, died in the Camphill Comm unity, Kaspar Hauser 's spiritual connection to the destiny of the people with special needs became more apparent to K \u00f6nig (M \u00fcller- Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 217). Rudolf Steiner had said, \"Alongside Christian Rosenkreutz, Kaspar Hauser is the one who had t he greatest understanding for the suffering of Christ \" (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 281). 88 Kaspar Hauser 's life was full of suffering. As a result, he was able to understand the deepest suffering of humanity and respond with love. K \u00f6nig recognized such a connection between Kaspar Hauser and the children with special needs who had died. The End of World War II World War II ended in Europe in May 1945 and the Pacific in August 1945 (Woolf, 2008, p. 259). Finally, the time to work toward world peace arrived. Karl K \u00f6nig worked with the theme of Kaspar Hauser after World War II, also (Selg, 2012, p. 72). A Christmas Story written by Karl K\u00f6nig A Christmas Story was written by Karl K \u00f6nig at Christmas 1946. A Christmas Story is a centrall y important story Karl K \u00f6nig' s wrote about the connection between Kaspar Hauser and people with special needs. Kaspar Hauser appeared in K \u00f6nig' s intuitive experience and he wrote down the story (Selg, 2012, p. 72). According to M \u00fcller- Wiedemann (1992/1996), in the story, the children who had passed away in Camphill did not have disabilities anymore. The children and Kaspar Hauser were connected in the heavens. These children who appeared in this Karl K\u00f6nig' s story were actual children who had died in the Camphill Community. In the spiritual world, the children had found their home with Kaspar Hauser. They had become Kaspar Hauser's brothers and sisters and the keepers of the spiritual image of the human being (p. 217). It is unusual in academic writing to write a very long quote such as this quote below. However, A Christmas Story has deep significance to understand the essence of this thesis, namely the connections between Kaspar Hauser, people with special needs, and Karl K \u00f6nig. They were intertwined with the development of the Camphill Community. Therefore, this long quote is included in this thesis as it is. The story is also deeply meaningful for the people who work in the Camphill Community. 89 Part of the story went as follows. I will summarize part of the story first in one paragraph. The night before Christmas eve, in Aberdeen, Scotland, Karl K \u00f6nig went for a walk in nature. As he walked, he entered a world not entirely familiar to him. It was a supersensible world. There he saw many of the childre n who had died in Camphill in the last few years. They did not have disabilities anymore. The children showed Karl K \u00f6nig how they were happily living in this land of the spirit. K \u00f6nig walked into a house in the spiritual world with two children, Christin e and Bobby (K \u00f6nig, 1995, pp. 9-22). Christine and Bobby had already gone into the house, and I [Karl K \u00f6nig] hurried to follow them. Inside there was one single room. On the longer, rough timber wall hung a picture and beneath it, to one side, someone was sitting. As it was darker inside the house than out, my eyes had first to adjust to the half -light within, but then I recognized who it was sitting on the chair. He nodded to me joyfully, and said; \"I [Sandy] shall soon be ready to follow the cross which became a cloud of light.\" \"Yes, Sandy,\" I [K \u00f6nig] replied, number of years.\" \"I [Sa ndy] am the heart of the Brotherhood,\" he answered, \"and have been waiting for a long time.\" I [Karl K \u00f6nig] now looked more closely at the picture on the wall. Christine was standing beneath it, holding Bobby's hand. She was busily showing everythi ng to the little new comer. \"That is Kaspar Hauser,\" she said, pointing to the picture. \"Kaspar in the House?\" asked Bobby? 90 \"Yes,\" said Christine, \"Kaspar Hauser.\" Now I [Karl K\u00f6nig] too recognized the picture. It showed a young pe rson, poorly clothed, with bare, bleeding feet, holding a large hat in his hand as though he wanted to greet everyone and bow down before them. Why is Kaspar Hauser's picture hanging here, I wondered? \"Don't you know why?\" Sandy asked looking at me. I said I could imagine, or at least divine, but that I could not be sure. \"When I first came here,\" Sandy explained, \"I [Sandy] built this little house. As you know, that was many years ago. At first I didn't know why I did it, but I felt such an urge in my heart that I collected logs and timber to build, and help came from everywhere. When the hut was finished, my heart became quiet and I loved simply to sit inside it and wait\u2014for what I did not know. I picked up the flowers that grew around the little house and looked down across the blue lake, and sometimes my mother came to visit me. She told me I should go with her to the place where she and many of our family lived in another hut, but I could not do so. Every time I even fairly considered going with her, a feeling of longing and anxiety filled my heart that was dispelled onl y when courage and the will to go on waiting awoke in me again. \"Then one day, as I [Sandy] was gazing down over the lake, I saw a young man descending from a mountain. His gait was laboured and his feet were bleeding, for his boots were slung over h is shoulder. When he finally reached the meadow, I saw his winning yet sad face and heard him say \"At last!\" \"At last? What could he mean, I [Sandy] \"Yes, at last I [The spirit of Kaspar Hauser] can take possession of the little house you have built.\" \"Take possession?\" I [Sandy] asked in astonishment, for it was my house. \"He [The spirit of Kaspar Hauser] said he had always searched for houses in which children who did not want to stay with their families but wanted to f ind a different destiny could be taken in.\" \"But will you allow me [Sandy] to stay in the house as well?\" \"Of course I will. You shall be the guardian of the house. Together let us prepare the brotherhood.\" \"At these words, he [The spirit of Kaspar Hauser] reached out and took a passing cloud, wrapped it around himself and vanished within it. I [Sandy] heard a sound of sobbing, and from the place his heart must have been, a light began to glow, growing ever stronger and more beautiful. Then the cloud drifted away and I saw him again. In his hands he held a picture of himself which he gave to me saying; \"Hang this picture in the house; it will make the house my place.\" \"I did so, and since then we have been preparing the Brothe rhood.\" I [Karl K \u00f6nig] was astonished at what Sandy was telling me and did not know what to make of it. I did know that the person Kaspar Hauser had always been close to my heart and that his being and destiny was deeply connected with the work we were doing. \"Yes, so it is,\" said Sandy. 92 At these words, as though in confirmation of them, a tiny hand took mine and I [K\u00f6nig] looked down and saw a little boy at my side. His face was shining as he looked up at me and pressed my hand in his. \"I am here too. It is good to be a child of Kaspar Hauser.\" \"Yes, Philip,\" I said, \"It is good to be in this house and to form the Brotherhood in the Land of Life and Trut h.\" (K \u00f6nig, 1995, pp. 22-24) Although A Christmas Story is a story written by Karl K \u00f6nig, it is also what he experienced in spirit as he walked through nature in Aberdeen on December 23, 1946. Kaspar Hauser was united with the children who had pass ed away in the Camphill Community. The story showed how Karl K \u00f6nig thought how deeply Kaspar Hauer was connected to the people with special needs. For Karl K \u00f6nig, Kaspar Hauser was connected to the new initiative of healing education, the Camphi ll Community, from the beginning. Since his appearance in 1828, Kaspar Hauser was the protector of the spiritual image of the human being. In the story, the spiritual image of the people with special needs were nurtured in the hut in the supersensible worl d. They were forming a brotherhood, even for those who would join later. The children were healed, happy, and were at peace. The element of the Mercury impulse of healing could be found in the story. The story showed how deeply Karl K \u00f6nig was connected to the people with special needs and to Kaspar Hauser. The story could help readers to understand the connections between the heavenly world above where the children had returned and the earthly world below where many people were striving to build a place of healing peace. Margrit Metraux shared a story of how she experienced A Christmas Story as she went to the Camphill Community in Aberdeen. \" As I went to the Camphill Community in Aberdeen, I met Dr. Karl K \u00f6nig. Dr. Karl K \u00f6nig was a special person. When I met him, he had already 93 written A Christmas Story . The images and the story of Kaspar Hauser and the children lived alive and accompanied me all along while working in Camphill Communities\" (Metraux, personal communication, March 31, 2021). A Chris tmas Story lives very deeply in the hearts of many people who work in Camphill Communities in accompanying the lives of people with special needs. 1948 in Zeist, Netherlands Selg (2012) wrote that on October 24, 1948, a curative educational conferenc e was organized by Karl K \u00f6nig in Zeist, Netherlands. Karl K \u00f6nig was forty- six years old. At the conference, the \"spirit- being of Kaspar Hauser \" was spoken many times by Karl K \u00f6nig (p. 74). \"In his preparatory notes, he wrote: 'The theme: Kaspar Hauser, because it is connected with everything that lives today as curative education, insofar as it manifests itself in the children '\" (pp. 74-75). Karl K \u00f6nig presented his Kaspar Hauser studies outside the Camphill Community. It was the first time he did that (p. 75). One could say Karl K \u00f6nig speaking about Kaspar Hauser in continental Europe was a gesture of bringing the Mercury impulse of healing to the European continent which was devastated by Mars impulse during World War II. Karl K \u00f6nig said in his lect ure, \"Kaspar Hauser was a bestower of blessings, both during his lifetime and after his death \" (as cited in Selg, 2012, p. 77). For K \u00f6nig, it was not only Kaspar Hauser who was the bestower of blessing, but the children with special needs were also the bestowers of blessing, for the family members and the world (Selg, 2012, p. 78). Karl K \u00f6nig thought that people with special needs could cultivate foundational human capacities, such as kindness and love, in a highly technological modern world. It was becom ing more difficult to manifest such humanness where the mechanical worldview was becoming dominant (Selg, 2012, p. 78). 94 Kaspar Hauser as an Archetype of People with Special Needs In Karl K \u00f6nig's biography, Karl K\u00f6nig: A Central European Biography of the Twentieth Century , Hans M \u00fcller- Wiedemann wrote about how Kaspar Hauser arrived in the Camphill Community in 1943, when Ita Wegman passed away (Selg, 2012, p. 72). M \u00fcller- Wiedemann (1992/1996) also wrote about the further developments of Anthroposophic curative education and social therapy in the Camphill Community. Over the years Kaspar Hauser's life -story became the archetypal life- story of the handicapped child, of his place in the world and our tasks re garding his education. In 1943 the archetypal picture of Kaspar Hauser was lifted out of the troubles and the grief of that year for the first time and became the guiding star of the unfolding Camphill movement. (p. 212) For Karl K \u00f6nig, Kaspar Haus er lived as the archetypal life -story of the people with special needs. When Ita Wegman, the leading figure of healing education, passed away, the presence of Kaspar Hauser emerged brighter as the guiding star of healing education. Karl K \u00f6nig (2008/2009b) wrote in The Child with Special Needs , \"Does not each of the so-called difficult to educate, retarded1 children come into life in a way similar to Kaspar Hauser? Poor, strange, and enigma and yet a blessing where they are met with an open heart \" (p. 151)? The above statement can be rephrased as \"Do we not experience each person with special needs, similar to how we experience Kaspar Hauser? Many people need care and love, but they 1 The term was still used when Karl K \u00f6nig wrote the article. In the field of special education today, the term is considered offensive and not used any longer. There are a few such words which were used in the past and which are quoted for this thesis but inappropr iate to use today. 95 bring humanness and spirituality when we meet from heart to heart .\" The way we meet a person with special needs is as special as meeting Kaspar Hauser. The Children of Europe When Karl K \u00f6nig gave lectures in 1953, he spoke about \" The Children of Europe: The Social Task of Curative Education\" in different towns (Steel, 2012, p. 124). Who were \" the Children of Europe? \" Kaspar Hauser was called the Child of Europe. \" When Karl K \u00f6nig gave lectures in Germany, in his lecture notes, he wrote 'To the Children of Europe' meaning the lectures were dedicated for the people with special needs; today' s Kaspar Hauser \" (Steel, personal communication, October 30, 2018). Such a story shows how much love Karl K \u00f6nig had for people with special needs and how he could see the lives of people with special needs connected to Kaspar Hauser. Eternal Childhood The Path of Sacrifice Out of Innocence Peter Selg (2012) wrote in Kaspar Hauser and Karl K \u00f6nig as follows: Kaspar Hauser bore his destiny with complete resignation and humility and followed the Christ's path of sacrifice born out of innocence. In this attitude Kaspar Hauser illumined the beginning of curative education, a movement which had taken up its work under the sign and out of consciousness of the pure forces of childhood. (p. 38) Kaspar Hauser possessed a pure soul like the pure force of childhood. The pure force of childhood is a guiding star of anthroposophic healing education. \"The Child\" of Europe He was called the Child of Europe. The quality of childhood made Kaspar Hauser special. He died approximately at the age of twenty -one. He never experienced adulthood in his 96 life. The fact that he never experienced adulthood is an indication that his whole being represented childhood, especially with the quality of child's innocence. The Gos pel of St. Matthew, Chapter 18 Verses 1 to 5 The eighteenth chapter of the Gospel of St. Matthew in the Christian Bible describes Jesus Christ answering one of His disciples' questions. This Bible passage reveals how important innocent childhood f orces are in connection to the closeness of spirit. In the hour the disciples came to Jesus and said, \"Who is greatest in the kingdom of heavens?\" And he called a child to him, put him in their midst and said, \"Yes, I say to you, if you do not turn about inwardly and reawaken the pure forces of childhood within yourself, you will not find access to the kingdom of the heavens. The more a person can humbly enliven this Being of the child within himself, the greater he is in the kingdom of the heavens. Whoever immerse himself in the being of such a child, trusting in me, will find me through the child. ( The New Testament: A Rendering by Jon Madsen , 1994/2006, Matthew 18:1 -5) Cultivating pure forces of childhood is a doorway to \"find access to the kingdom of heavens.\" It is crucial in anthroposophic healing education to make steps in inner development. How one's heart can become like that of a child again is part of inner transformation for healing educators. Through finding the pure force of childhood in the hearts, healing educators c an recognize the divine in each person and all things in the world. Sergei Prokofieff, the Nathan -Being, and Childhood At the Michaelmas Conference in 2009, Sergei Prokofieff (2010/2011) spoke about how vital the Nathan soul is as part of the path of modern initiation (p. 48). 97 It concerns what we need in order to be able to take the Christ into ourselves in the modern sense. In order to achieve this, we must actually accomplish something that is almost impossible. We must unite what is contradictory so that all that is archetypal in the turning point of time can become a new reality in us. We must reach for the very earliest childhood forces within ourselves. We must reach into the region that was completely untouched by the Fall of Man and thus make it possible for every human being to find an inward connection with the Nathan soul. Like the Nathan soul at the turning point of time, we must become children again \u2014in the sense of a child's purity, love, and compassion. And then- in full consciousness\u2014we are to permeate these archetypal forces of childhood with the forces of the highest wisdom we can garner today from anthroposophy. (p. 49) What Prokofieff stated in the lecture was the importance of the unification of childhood forces and wisdom as a path to Christ in the modern world. The significance of childhood force which Prokofieff spoke about had been elaborated by Rudolf Steiner (2001a) in the last lecture in According to Luke: The Gospel of Compassion and Love Revealed. It is important to co nsider this childlike element because it provides an initial point of entry for the Christ faculties. We must begin by making this childlike element wise and then move on to make our other faculties wise again. In this respect, each of us carries a childlike nature within us, which, when it becomes active, is receptive to uniting with the Christ principle. (p. 211) Awakening pure force of childhood is an essential experience of the human being to reconnect to the spirit. The pure force of childho od that Kaspar Hauser brought nurtures human soul capacities needed for humanity's healing and future spiritual development. 98 Faust, Death and the Hovering Child at the First Goetheanum Raske (1983a) wrote that above the fifth column of the small cupola in the First Goetheanum that Rudolf Steiner had built, there was an image of Faust, death, and the hovering child facing Faust (p. 157). Guy Alma gave presentations for the Camphill Community that the child flies toward Faust from left to right from the large cupola, when one stands inside the building facing south. (Alma, 2021). Rudolf Steiner spoke about this painting in different lectures and how he described it in his lectures are documented in Raske's (1983a) The Language of Color in the First Goet heanum: A Study of Rudolf Steiner's Art . Steiner described the figure of Faust as representing a seeker in the modern world (Steiner, 1920, as cited in Raske, 1983a, p. 160). Faust was a seeker in search of knowledge. As part of this picture, there was the only word written as part of the artwork in the building. The word was \"Ich,\" the German word for \"I\" in English (Steiner, 1921, as cited in Raske, 1983a, p. 161). Modern human beings' thinking processes lead to the process of death. Faust, as a seeker, t akes in death forces in his search for knowledge. (Steiner, 1920, as cited in Raske 1983a, p. 162) To make earthly knowledge into spiritual knowledge, one has to make steps in inner development. Raske (1983a) described the process of spiritual development as follows. \"The winged child, enveloped by light like an angel, floats towards Faust. . . . Faust would freeze in the inner coldness of his thought processes were he not irradiated by the child's warmth of heart and light of the future\" (p. 159). Alma stated that the child comes as a spiritual messenger from the future (Alma, 2021). Without the child's light, human beings' thinking and hearts will remain desolate. The innocence of childhood force brings light to modern human beings. (Steiner, 1920, as cited in Raske, 1983a, p. 162) This painting of Faust, death, and the hovering child is an important 99 image to understand for human beings in the modern world, who experience desolateness, to find spiritual light again. See Appendix to see the artw ork of Faust, death, and the hovering child facing Faust painted on the small cupola of the First Goetheanum. Peter Tradowsky (1980/2012), who has researched Kaspar Hauser, also wrote about this painting of Faust and the child in relation to Kaspar H auser in his book. In this sense must he who strives like Faust take into himself the Kaspar Hauser element so that man may be completely renewed. Kaspar Hauser in his child's nature is the future which Faust needs in order to attain his goal of defeating Mephistopheles (p. 86) This image underscores the importance of how the innocence of childhood forces together with conscious work on individual spiritual development may overcome the power of adversary forces. Kaspar Hauser was a being who represented the innocence of a ch ild and who could bring spiritual renewal. Kaspar Hauser and Charles Darwin Richard Steel gave a presentation about Kaspar Hauser and Charles Darwin at the Kaspar Hauser Festival in autumn 2017. Charles Darwin was born in 1809. He was born around the same time as Kaspar Hauser if Kaspar Hauser was born in 1812. Just while Kaspar Hauser appeared on the street of Nuremberg in 1828, Charles Darwin embarked on a journey on HMS Beagle around the world in 1831 (Steel, 2017). During his trip, Darwin devised his evolutionary theory, the process of natural selection. The human being was considered to have evolved out of an apelike existence (Woolf, 2008, p. 243). Richard Steel said, \"Even Darwin's ship ironically had a name of an animal\" (Steel, 2017). On the other hand, Kaspar Hauser appeared in Nuremberg and became the symbol of the protector of the spiritual image of the human being (Steel, 2017). 100 In the year Kaspar Hauser appeared in Nuremberg, the chemist, Friedrich Wohler, succeeded to produce the substance urea synthetically in his laboratory. Thus for the first time, an organic chemical compound was artificially produced. In the same year, Karl Ernst von Baer published his ground -breaking book on the development of the chicken- embryo and described in detail the gradual unfolding of the body from the fertilized egg. These two discoveries open wide the door to the new kingdom of descriptive science. (K\u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 26) In 1859, On The Or igin of Species by Charles Darwin was published (Woolf, 2008, p. 243). The worldview of Charles Darwin and the worldview born out of the appearance of Kaspar Hauser created two different images of the human being and the subsequent two different social developments in the twentieth century (Steel, 2017). Darwinism, Materialistic Natural Science, Social Darwinism, and World War II Charles Darwin, who considered the human being evolved out of apelike ancestors, represented the materialistic scientific d evelopment in the nineteenth century. Darwin's theory of natural selection was eventually adopted in social theory as Social Darwinism. Social Darwinism led to the rise of Nazism, eugenics, and World War II (Steel, 2017). Kaspar Hauser, Rudolf Steiner, Karl K\u00f6nig, the Camphill Community, and Healing Education Kaspar Hauser lived as the protector of the spiritual image of the human being, who maintained the \"contact between the earth and the heavenly world\" (as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 282) a t the beginning of the nineteenth century. Rudolf Steiner brought Anthroposophy into the world and spoke about the eternal spirit in each human being. Karl K\u00f6nig, who embodied both the spirit of Kaspar Hauser and Anthroposophy, founded the 101 Camphill Community for people with special needs. In the Camphill Community, people worked out of the spiritual image of the human being. Such a practice and the social ideal of community building took place even during World War II. The Camphill Community worked for and continues to work for the spiritual ideal of brotherhood and sisterhood for the future of humankind (Steel, 2017). One would find a completely different orientation to the world, depending on which view one adheres to. Kaspar Hauser was able to be t he protector of the spiritual image of the human being. Kaspar Hauser and Being Human For Karl K \u00f6nig, Kaspar Hauser was his inner guide to bring about healing to the people around him. Peter Selg (2010/2011) spoke about how Karl K \u00f6nig lived side -by-side with Kaspar Hauser. The being of Kaspar Hauser became his [Karl K \u00f6nig' s] inner companion, with whom he has occupied himself already early on, and who had experienced being a stranger or being alienated in a terrible way. Alienation, isolation, Kaspar Hauser 's prison \u2014this occupied Karl K \u00f6nig lifelong, yet at the same time, there was the endeavor for healing, for the human soul's finding a home on earth, in as far as this is possible. And this led, as you all knew, to the founding of the community that we today designate with the name Camphill. . . . In dealing with children in need of special care, one is closer to the human element, to the truth of the human being, to the Christ. This is something that many people experienced with Karl K \u00f6nig. It was with this caring devotion and love that K \u00f6nig's path and that of his community unfolded. (p. 56) 102 Karl K \u00f6nig was able to extend help to those who were in need. K \u00f6nig' s heart connection to Kaspar Hauser helped K \u00f6nig have such a gesture of compassion t oward others. His connections to Kaspar Hauser helped him experience humanness, as well. People with Special Needs as Teachers Teachers and students develop wonderful relationships. While teachers teach, teachers also learn from students. Students ar e also teachers for the teachers. When teachers teach people with special needs, teachers also learn from the people with special needs. Karl K \u00f6nig had said people with special needs \" remind us of our higher nature and better self \" (K\u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 29). Karl K \u00f6nig wrote to the parents of the Camphill Schools and the Village Community at the Lake of Constance in May 1965 and described people with special needs as teachers (M\u00fc ller- Wiedemann, 1992/1996, pp. 476-478) . K\u00f6nig (2008/2009b) made the statement less than one year before his passing in 1966. We should all be increasingly filled with the idea that these children are our teachers; teachers in a higher sense. For they have taken their destiny \u2014to be bent and deformed, ill-prepared for life and retarded \u2014upon themselves. They do not complain and are not surly. They also do not accuse or bewail their fate. Rather do they take their being different courageously upon themselves, in the way that a person carries his cross on his shoulders, and says \"yes\" to it, unreservedly. We should not think that they do not understand who and how they are. They know this very well and nevertheless remain courageous, cheerful and full of hope. Should we not follow their exam ples? All of us? Which of us does not let our courage 103 fail and our hope wane more often than our children? It is in this sense that I mean they are our teachers. (p. 28) People with special needs are teachers of humanity. They bring dignity, courage, joy, and positivity to awaken human beings to the good. People with special needs affect all who interact with them, including teachers. Teachers wake up, and love emerges. People with special needs are teachers of the teachers. Human Heart As Richard St eel (2012) wrote, \"The keynote of Karl K \u00f6nig' s biography is intimately connected to the heart \" (p. 136). To take up the task that arose from the heart was what people in the youth group in Vienna lived with. When the Nazis occupied Vienna, their wish to f ollow the impulse in their hearts became even more potent. In Rudolf Steiner's lecture, which the people in the youth group were reading, the word \" heart \" appeared ten times in the last ten sentences (p. 136). The following quote was part of Rudolf Steine r's (1961/2007) lecture that they were reading. What I would prefer is for you to have something in your hearts and then to transform what you carry in your hearts into activity. What human beings carry in their heads will be lost along the way. But what t hey receive into their hearts, their hearts will preserve and carry into all spheres of activity in which they are involved. . . . Out of this feeling, let me give you my farewell greeting today by saying: Take what I have tried to express as if I had want ed, above all, to let something that cannot be uttered in words penetrate into your hearts. If hearts have found some connection with what is meant here by the living spirit, then at least in part what we wanted to achieve in these gatherings will have been fulfilled. We want to take this feeling with us when we separate today. With this 104 feeling, however, we want also to come together again. Thus we shall find connection in the spirit, even though we work apart in different spheres of life. The chief thing will be that in our hearts we have found each other. Then the spiritual, all that belongs to Michael, will also flow into our hearts. (p. 156) Michael refers to Archangel Michael that appeared in the Bible. \"And a war flared up in the heavenly world. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon fought in the midst of his angels\" ( The New Testament: A Rendering by Jon Madsen, 1994/2006, The Revelation to John 12: 7). For Karl K \u00f6nig (2008/2009b), \" heart -knowledge \" was an important way to know the world (p. 42). Heart -knowledge requires knowing through the heart and sensing from the heart . One could come close to the essence of matters and be true to oneself. In this way, one could behold the world with l ove. Creating a Heart in the Spiritual World Towards the end of Karl K \u00f6nig' s A Christmas Story, K\u00f6nig (1995) described a story about the brotherhood in which the spirit of Kaspar Hauser and the children who passed away were together, creating a he art in the spiritual world. Prepare the Brotherhood, for now I know what you are doing. I cannot describe what I mean, but I feel deeply that you are creating a heart that pours its strength into the valley through a tenfold coloured window. A heart that a llows the blood of Life and Faith to flow from above to below, and from below to above. (p. 25) Through Camphill, Karl K \u00f6nig's great wish was to preserve the spiritual image of the human being (Selg, 2012, pp. 77-78). This spiritual image of the human being also had to do with the heart. 105 K\u00f6nig was aware that Kaspar 's historic task was summed up in the particular nature of the \"handicapped' with which he appeared in Nuremberg, in that an \"ancient Atlantean heart quality\" (Rudolf Steiner) was in tended to counteract the onset of intellectualism and the exaggerated consciousness of nation -hood. (M \u00fcller-Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 214) Through the work with people with special needs and the development of communities around the people, those who work in the Camphill Community are preparing for the future ideal of humanity (Steel, 2012, p. 137). The future ideal is the development of love and the human being's heart forces for each other. The ideal is also to connect to the heart in the spiritual world. The Image of the Human Being Karl K \u00f6nig (2018) wrote about the spiritual image of the human being. This image is the foundation of being human. \" This essay was written as the editorial of The Cresset , Michaelmas 1965, commemorating 25 years of Camphill \" (p. 226). The essence of the essay was what K \u00f6nig and people working in the Camphill Community had worked on all along. Karl K \u00f6nig wrote the essay toward the end of his life, summing up the effort that had happened in Camphill. The spiritual image of the human being was essential for Karl K \u00f6nig. Many of the messages from the end of K \u00f6nig' s life can be considered important last messages. The meaning of these sharings is important to my research; therefore some of the writings will be presented in long quotes. We are convinced that every human being has his individual existence not only here on earth between birth and death, but that e very child was a spiritual entity before he was born, and that every human being will continue to live after he has passed through the gate of death. Thus, any kind of physical or mental disability has not arisen by chance or misfortune. It has a definite meaning for each individual and is meant to change his life. 106 Like any other human being who has to struggle with various illnesses, the special needs child has also to learn to live with his ailment or to conquer it. As parents and teachers, our task is to address the eternal being of the child so as to lead him to a recognition of his destiny. However obscured his individuality may be by the many layers of inability, lameness and uncontrolled emotions, we must nevertheless try to break through these sheath s and reach the holy of the holies in every human being: the seat of his essential spiritual existence. The conviction that every human being carries this \"I\" in him and that this \"I\" is eternal, imperishable and of spiritual origin, is fundamental to our attitude to the child. He is our brother and sister. He is our equal and the equal of every other human being. We are concerned not with the \"handicapped\" child, but with the child who is handicapped. Many of them are mentally retarded, paralyzed, epil eptic, of unsound mind, lazy or abnormal. All this may be as it appears; nevertheless, the most kernel of their being is not only infinite but holy and divine. It is part of the Godhead whence it came, to which it will return and from which it will come ag ain. Their crippled and distorted lives are each but one of many lives on their way back to the Father. We are all prodigal sons seeking our way back to the house of the eternal ground of the world, to the fountainhead of our existence. This is the first e ssential of Camphill. (pp. 130-131) To view that all human beings carry the eternal spirit, as Rudolf Steiner explained, is called the First Essential of the Camphill Community. For Karl K \u00f6nig, the spiritual image of the human being was a reality and tr ue from the time of the founding of the Camphill Community. After practicing healing education based on this worldview for 25 years, in 1965 in Germany, he could continue to speak about it as a confirmation of what he had practiced. 107 Karl K\u00f6nig and Kaspar Hauser Part II The Founding of the Camphill Community in Germany and the Third Moon- Node for Karl K\u00f6nig The first Camphill Community in Germany began in April 1958. The community was founded in the area of the Lake Constance (Steel, 2012, p. 104). C amphill Brachenreuthe was founded (M \u00fcller- Wiedemann, 1990, p. 129). Karl K \u00f6nig was fifty -five years old, on his way to become fifty -six. This new development of the Camphill Community took place in Central Europe around Karl K \u00f6nig' s third Moon- node. George and Gisela O 'Neil (1990) explained the third Moon -node in the following way. The creative life -forces have been accessible, and the highly productive often over -do and exhaust themselves. . . . There can follow a change of fortune, as though we had learned something by these trials: newly -found strength, conviction, and power. Political fortunes often change at 56! . . . We can be selflessly creative, identifying ourselves with greater goals. (p. 179) Karl K \u00f6nig worked on bringing back the Camphill Community to Central Europe during the remaining years of his life (Steel, 2010/2011, p. 89). The spiritual ideals of Camphill and those of Central Europe were considered to have connections (M \u00fcller-Wiedemann, 1990, p. 129). Relocating to Central Europe meant K \u00f6nig could serve the Children of Europe for Kaspar Hauser. He moved to the Lake Constance area and helped with the development of the Camphill Community. By moving there, \"he connected himself deeply with the landscape of Baden \u2014the birthplace and the rightful territory of Kaspar Hauser\" (Steel, pp. 89-90). According to Steel (2010/2011), Karl K \u00f6nig could see the castle of the Margrave of Baden in Salem from 108 the Camphill School in F \u00f6hrenb\u00fchl (p. 90). It was meaningful he could see one of the buildings of the House of Baden from the new Camphill in Germany. Such a fact showed the Camphill Community 's and Karl K \u00f6nig' s deep connection to Kaspar Hauser. The Second Moon -Node Since the Curati ve Education Course , Saturn- Return, and Jupiter -Return for Karl K \u00f6nig The second Moon- node since Rudolf Steiner had given The Curative Education Course approximately corresponded to September 1961. As mentioned earlier, Ita Wegman passed away around the first Moon -node in 1943. It was also when Karl K \u00f6nig dedicated \" a kind of Requiem \" Kaspar Hauser to Ita Wegman. Karl K \u00f6nig turned fifty- nine years old in 1961 and sixty years old in 1962. Bryant (1993/2018) observed that \"The thirty- year rhyt hm in human biography can reasonably be called the 'Saturn Cycle'\" (p. 97). Jupiter's cycle is twelve years (p. 137). Between the fifty -ninth and the sixtieth year in a human being's biography, the two planets, Saturn and Jupiter, return to the res pective positions they held at the time of birth. Such an occurrence can impact biography significantly. For Karl K \u00f6nig, the second Moon -node since Rudolf Steiner had given The Curative Education Course also fell in these years. Karl K\u00f6nig visiting Ansba ch for the First Time According to Steel (2012), Karl K \u00f6nig was scheduled to give lectures in Nuremberg in November 1961. Karl K \u00f6nig was fifty -nine years old. During the trip, Karl K \u00f6nig went to Ansbach, the city in which Kaspar Hauser died, for t he first time in his life. He went to Kaspar Hauser's grave and walked where Kaspar Hauser had often visited. Going to these places in Ansbach moved his heart deeply (p. 127). 109 Karl K \u00f6nig wrote down the experience of his visit in an essay titled The Story of Kaspar Hauser for the Christmas issue of the Camphill Journal, The Cresset (Selg, 2012, p. 76). The essay is included as the first chapter of the book Kaspar Hauser and Karl K \u00f6nig, edited by Richard Steel and Peter Selg. The essay can also be found in A Christmas Story by Karl K \u00f6nig, published in 1995. In 1961, the Camphill Community, the movement that started on June 1, 1940, celebrated its twenty -first birthday. Around the age of twenty- one, the human being begins life as an adult. \"As twenty -one-year-olds, they stand poised on the launch pad of independent life, bearing the mandate of their own responsibility\" (Bryant, 1993/2018, p. 56). Age twenty- one was also the supposed age when Kaspar Hauser passed away if he had been born on September 2 9, 1812. At such a time, K \u00f6nig visited Ansbach. After his visit to Ansbach, including a visit to a museum that displayed many things about Kaspar Hauser, Karl K \u00f6nig (1961/2012a) wrote his experience in Ansbach as follows: We wander from picture to picture, from case to case, and gradually our soul absorbs the nature of Kaspar Hauser. . . . We leave the room, walk down the stairs: outside the sun is setting radiantly beautiful. The streets are glowing in its colours which ca st their glimmer over the houses and the church. It is as if these heavenly colours would express the wonder of Kaspar Hauser. For once an innocent man lived for a few years here in this town, but hardly anyone recognized his true being. (pp. 17-18) This experience on Karl K \u00f6nig' s Satrun -return and Jupiter- return was an opportunity for Karl K \u00f6nig to deeply connect to where Kaspar Hauser had lived. Kaspar Hauser as the Patron Saint of People with Special Needs Karl K \u00f6nig (1961/2012a) then concluded the essay with the following paragraph. 110 Kaspar Hauser kept the true image of man alive for the future of mankind. He retained the immortal part of our spiritual existence and handed it over to us. We experience the wonder and dignity of our own chil dhood when we read of his life and death, and we remember that we are not just a mortal piece of matter, but an immortal and essential element of the whole creation. Children with handicaps move our hearts in a similar way. They too remind us of our higher nature and better self. Their patron saint is the Prince of Baden, the Child of Europe, the protector of the image of God. (p. 29) Kaspar Hauser helped us remember our higher nature, and reminded us that we are immortal spiritual beings. He lived as the protector of the people with special needs, so that people with special needs could connect with their divine nature. People with spe cial needs are guarded and guided by their patron saint, Kaspar Hauser. Building the First Camphill Hall Around the same time, building a new hall for Camphill in Aberdeen was underway (Steel, 2012, p. 129). When the architect, Gabor Tallo, came to Camphill in November 1958, the vision of building a hall for the Camphill Community in Aberdeen became a real possibility (Allen, 1990, p. 26). With building a hall, there would be a possibility in Camphill for the members in the community to gather together, enjoy a cultural and social life, and celebrate festivals together. It was going to be a major step forward in the community- building effort for the people in Camphill. The Logo of Camphill Community Steel (2018) observed that the building was a bout to be completed. The date of the official opening of the Camphill Hall was approaching. The motif design that would be in the middle of the staircase, however, was not finished. Karl K \u00f6nig had only indicated that \" the form 111 was to be 'the dove', the s pirit-germ descending\" (p. 217). The image represented the Christ impulse humanity had experienced: God's Spirit coming down to Jesus at the Jordan River, and Christ Jesus's deeds of offering rising back up to the heavenly world (p. 220). The image repres ented the striving people in Camphill were working on, and would continue to work on into the future. The Opening Celebration of Camphill Hall in September 1962 According to Steel (2012), \"The hall was ready and the celebrations in September 1962 around K \u00f6nig's sixtieth birthday began \" (p. 129). The authorities and many guests came to Camphill for the official opening of the hall. On this special occasion, Karl K \u00f6nig spoke about Kaspar Hauser at the opening address. He indicated that the hall had b een completed around 150 years after Kaspar Hauser 's supposed birth. \"The children of Kaspar Hauser \" was what Karl K\u00f6nig called the children at the Camphill School (p. 129). The following quote is part of Karl K \u00f6nig' s actual speech given at the off icial opening ceremony of Camphill Hall on September 22, 1962. Dear friends, this is a story which is still ringing in tens of thousands or hearts of men. It is the story of the Child of Europe. And what he introduced was an image, a sign for things to com e; a sign for tens of thousands of children, who were disposed of, who are sent into the dark, who were not permitted to be the crown- prince of man, because they were dull, malformed, blind, psychotic and so on. Today it is different. Today the life of Kaspar Hauser has shone into the hearts of men. It has woken up the conscience of all civilized people, of parents, of doctors, of teachers, of authorities. And today the children of Kaspar Hauser more and more are recognized. 112 But now, dear friends, tha t we from Camphill have fought for the recognition that in each one of these children the image of man is shining, that none of these children ought to be disposed of, that each one has to give the help, the education, the love, attention, each human child deserves. We have not stopped fighting for it. We have built this Hall for these children, because, dear friends, something which is so beautiful should teach, help and form these children. (K \u00f6nig, 1962) According to Steel (2012), since the hall was going to have the name of the Hall of Memory and Conscience (p. 129), it was surprising that Karl K \u00f6nig talked about Kaspar Hauser. However, since Karl K \u00f6nig had a deep connection to Kaspar Hauser, it was appropriate he spoke about Hauser. The speech at the opening ceremony of the first hall can be seen as a confirmation of Kaspar Hauser as a spiritual guide for healing education. It was as if the being of Kaspar Hauser connected to this special building that would represent the Camphill Movement. The speech on this occasion will help people remember K \u00f6nig and Hauser 's deep connection for years. Building the Camphill Hall was one of the culmination of Karl K \u00f6nig' s work in the Camphill Community in Aberdeen. Developing Camphill Communities in Central Europe \"After the official opening, as though inspired by the entry of the being of Kaspar Hauser into the first Camphill Hall, K \u00f6nig began increasingly to orient himself toward outward Central Europe \" (Steel, 2012, p. 129). Steel (2012) observed that Karl K \u00f6nig had a deep relationship with Dr. Georg von Arnim. Georg von Arnim was a physician and had decided to help develop Camphill Communities on the Lake Constance in Germany (p. 130). Later Georg von Arnim and Hans M\u00fcller -Wiedemann continued to wor k with the theme of Kaspar Hauser. The assembly hall of F\u00f6hrenb\u00fchl School was named Kaspar Hauser Hall when it was built (p. 130). According to 113 Allen (1990), Kaspar Hauser Hall was completed in September 1971 (p. 185). It was significant that one of Camphill' s assembly halls in Central Europe took on the name of Kaspar Hauser. Let us remember that F \u00f6hrenb\u00fchl School was the Camphill where \" The castle of the Margrave of Baden in Salem was even visible to Karl K \u00f6nig from the new Camphill School in F \u00f6hren b\u00fchl\" (Steel, 2010/2011, p. 90). Karl K\u00f6nig 's Final Days Karl K \u00f6nig issued the last Camphill Letter at Christmas 1965. It was three months before he died. In this Camphill Letter, Karl K \u00f6nig shared his thoughts about the essence of curative education (Selg, 2012, p. 80). His message was not limited to the practitioners of curative education in school settings or people working in social therapeutic villages. What K \u00f6nig (2008/2009b) wrote applied to the healing of whole humanity: We only need to define the concept of curative education widely enough to see its true purpose. It is more than just practical child psychiatry and educational and psychological efforts to handle maladjusted children and dropped out young people. Its intention is to beco me a global task to help counteract the \"threat to the individual person\" which has arisen everywhere. The \"curative -educational attitude\" needs to express itself in any social work, in pastoral care, in the care for the elderly, in the rehabilitation of m entally ill and physically handicapped people, in guidance of orphans and refugees, or suicidal and desperate individuals, in the international Peace Corps and similar ambitions. This is the only answer we have today \u2014inasmuch as we still want to be human beings \u2014or a society dancing on the brink of disaster. No philosophy congresses, international conferences, religious gatherings and enormous scientific events will 114 influence this dance of death in any way. On these occasions, everybody just wants to hear th emselves and \u2014while staying within the rules \u2014bring attention to themselves. Only support from person to person \u2014the encounter of a self with another self \u2014 the awareness of another individuality without questioning the other's religion, convictions, and politi cal background \u2014just the gaze from eye to eye between two personalities, creates the kind of curative education which can, in a healing way, counteract the threat to the core of humanity. However this can only work on the strength of profound heart -knowle dge. (p. 42) Such messages as \" only support from person to person . . . counteract the threat to the core of humanity\" can be seen as the final message of Karl K \u00f6nig. Such a gesture could bring healing to the whole world. The message also tells how important heart -forces were for Karl K \u00f6nig. He connected to Kaspar Hauser, and to his fellow human beings, through his heart . Karl K\u00f6nig 's Death According to M \u00fcller- Wiedemann (1992/1996), On March 19, K \u00f6nig went to the Goetheanum for the last time. He went there t o be part of a preparatory meeting for a doctor 's conference. As K \u00f6nig came back to Camphill Brachenreuthe, he had a heart attack on March 23. He was taken to a local hospital on March 25. Then on March 27, around noon, Karl K \u00f6nig passed away. (p. 436) \"The Lake of Constance, in this context, signified the land of Kaspar Hauser. Scotland was where Karl K \u00f6nig began the work of the Camphill Community. He died near the home of Kaspar Hauser \" (Steel, personal communication, November 4, 2018). Although Karl K \u00f6nig had to go to Scotland to start the curative education practice, it must have been meaningful for Karl K\u00f6nig to connect with the land of Kaspar Hauser at the end of his life. 115 Karl K\u00f6nig, the Camphill Community, and the Threefold Social Organism Rudolf Steiner's social thought, the Threefold Social Organism, failed to be taken up by the world after World War I. As mentioned earlier, the idea was rejected by the descendant of the Baden family, Max von Baden, in 1918. One person who took up the social theory of the Threefold Social Organism was Karl K\u00f6nig. Karl K \u00f6nig worked with the Threefold Social Organism in the Camphill Community. The Threefold Social Organism is also called the Threefold Social Order. The social idea that was rejected by the descendant of the Baden family, who possibly succeeded the throne out of political intrigue, was taken up by Karl K \u00f6nig, who had a strong spiritual connection to Kaspar Hauser. Karl K \u00f6nig gave several lectures between 1962 and 1964, toward the very end of his life, for Camphill Communities, where adults with special needs lived. These lectures became a book that had the title Seeds for Social Renewal: The Camphill Village Conferences (1986/2009a). The Curative Education Course is th e lecture cycle people mainly study to train curative educators at Camphill Schools for children. Seeds for Social Renewal is studied as part of coworker education in Camphill Communities where adults with special needs live. In these lectures, Karl K \u00f6nig called the Camphill Communities for adults with special needs \"The Village.\" The last lecture Karl K \u00f6nig gave as part of Seeds for Social Renewal was on January 20, 1964. Karl K \u00f6nig gave the lecture two years before his death. The lecture had the title \" The Threefold Social Organism. \" K\u00f6nig (1986/2009a) wrote: The Village impulse , if we dare call it that, is a new form in which to practice the ideals of the threefold social order. I am not implying in any way that our work with people with special needs is a means to the end of establishing the threefold social order. Our 116 work with special people is an earnest, serious, filled with good will and enthusiasm to help as it could be. Gradually through this work we have discovered a possibility, an opportunity to put the ideals of the threefold social order into practice. Whenever you are in despair in your daily work in the villages, turn to the great ideals of the threefold social order, and be inspired by the conviction that our work is an opportunity, an attempt to instill into human kind the only available help for the social rejuvenation of our existence. I repeat: the only available help! (pp. 250-251) As much as Kaspar Hauser was the spiritual guide to anthro posophic healing education for Karl K \u00f6nig, the Threefold Social Organism was the way to work on community development and social renewal. Karl K \u00f6nig (1986/2009a) called the Threefold Social Organism \" the only available help\" (p. 251). Social renewal is c onsidered part of developing brotherhood and sisterhood among humankind, to which Kaspar Hauser was also connected. The Development of the Camphill Community in the United States of America According to M \u00fcller- Wiedemann (1992/1996), Karl K \u00f6nig and Alix Roth traveled to the USA and Canada from July to October 1960 (p. 338). Around the same time Karl K \u00f6nig' s effort was turning to the development of the Camphill Community in Central Europe, an effort to develop the Camphill Community in the United States also took place. Karl K \u00f6nig and Alix Roth first arrived in Downingtown (p. 338) in Pennsylvania. Then they went to Copake in New York in the summer of 1960 (p. 338). Carlo Pietzner came to Copake in 1961(Camphill Village Copake, n.d.). In Septembe r 1961, Camphill Community in the USA was officially founded (M\u00fcller-Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 339). Karl K \u00f6nig visited America for the second time from July until August in 1962 ( M\u00fcller- Wiedemann, 1992/1996, p. 343). During this trip, Karl K \u00f6nig left a verse for the people working 117 for the development of the Camphill Community in America. The verse is called \" For the Friends in America. \" Karl K \u00f6nig wrote in the guest book of Donegal Springs House, Pennsylvania, in August 1962. The eternal lamps of holy spirit of the light build the tower of human confidence, which out of brotherly love in our hearts takes shape. The eternal columns of helping spirit -messengers form the bridge of presiding faithfulness which spans from I to I in working for our t ask. Thus we unite and strengthen in the work we have begun of which the Good shall become so is assigned to us in spirit. And may the call from soul to soul Sound through our working bond (K \u00f6nig, 2020, p. 62). Karl K \u00f6nig wrote the verse originally in German. What is provided above is its English translation. In this verse, Karl K \u00f6nig worked on the theme of creating bridges between people, from I to I. Such a spirit is the foundation of the spiritual striving i n the Camphill Community. 118 Karl K \u00f6nig' s deep wish for how Camphill Communities could develop in America was written in this verse. As mentioned in the chapter Karl K\u00f6 nig and Kaspar Hauser Part II , Karl K \u00f6nig returned to Scotland on August 29 after visiting the USA (Steel, 2018, p. 222). The opening ceremony of the first Camphill Hall took place in September 1962. Aspects of Kaspar Hauser's Influence in Anthroposophic Curative Education and Social Therapy in America Carlo Pietzner Steel (201 0/2011) has written that Carlo Pietzner began the work in America in 1961 in Pennsylvania then in New York State until his death (p. 89). Carlo Pietzner was part of the young people who met Karl K \u00f6nig in Vienna (p. 87). Carlo was twenty- three years old th en. He was an artist. He used his artistic talent to serve the Camphill Community until he died in 1986 in Camphill Village Copake (pp. 88- 89). Steel (2010/2011) told how important the theme of the spiritual task of Central Europe had been for Karl K \u00f6nig. Carlo Pietzener continued to work with the theme and returned to Europe often to paint, offered art retreats, etc. (p. 90) When Carlo Pietzner began the work in America in 1961, Karl K \u00f6nig visited Kaspar Hauser 's grave in Ansbach and wrote The Stor y of Kaspar Hauser for a Camphill journal (p. 89). Karl K \u00f6nig was also increasingly involved with the development of the Camphill Community in Central Europe. As the work of Camphill bridged back to Central Europe, the work also expanded to America. As much as Karl K \u00f6nig deepened his relationship with Kaspar Hauser and visited Ansbach, Carlo Pietzner came to America and eventually wrote a play about Kaspar Hauser. \". . . And From the Night, Kaspar\" A Kaspar Hauser Play Written by Carlo Pietzner 119 Carlo Pietzner wrote a Kaspar Hauser Play . . . And From the Night, Kaspar in 1975 (Pietzner, 1983, p. 32). The play depicted the life of Kaspar Hauser chronologically backward. Personalities who surrounded Kaspar Hauser and the five young people searching for the meaning of life through learning about Kaspar Hauser were part of the play. Carlo Pietzner deeply understood how much Kaspar Hauser had meant for Karl K \u00f6nig. (Steel, 2010/2011, p. 87) He himself also studied Kaspar Hauser and wrote this play for the Camphill Community. Carlo Pietzner's play showed how important Kaspar Hauser was for him. Carlo Pietzner wrote the play for the opening of the new hall in Camphill Glencraig in Northern Ireland, which was to have the name of Kaspar Hauser Hall. (Pi etzner, 1983, p. 34) Carlo's first major community building work before coming to the USA was to build up Camphill Glencraig, which started in 1954 (Steel, 2010/2011, p. 89). A curative education school building in The Camphill School, Pennsylvania, was being built around the same time. The play was scheduled to be performed for the opening ceremony of the school building, which would be called Karl K \u00f6nig House (Steel, 2010/2011, p. 89). The first performance of the play took place at the opening ceremony of Karl K \u00f6nig House in The Camphill School in July 1975. Then the performance took place at the opening ceremony of the Kaspar Hauser Hall in Camphill Glencraig, Northern Ireland, in October 1975 (Pietzner, 1983, p. 34). Kaspar Hauser H all in Glencraig was an assembly hall where people in the community frequently gathered. Karl K \u00f6nig House in Pennsylvania was a school building where education for children with special needs took place. These buildings were places where people in the community gathered for cultural, educational, and social occasions. People came together for human encounters and the celebration of festivals. 120 \"Over the years, some halls and houses in Camphill Communities took on the name of Kaspar Hauser\" (Metraux , personal communication, March 31, 2021). The name Kaspar Hauser is important for many people in Camphill. It is very meaningful for the people in Camphill when where people gather and live, bears the name of Kaspar Hauser. It is as if his spirit, who wan ts to connect through the heart -forces, incarnates when his name is given to a building. Carlo Pietzner also helped with the first production of . . . And From the Night, Kaspar in the German language. The play was performed in Kaspar Hauser Hall in F\u00f6hrenb\u00fchl, Germany (Steel, 2010/2011, p. 90). The German translation was a gift to Erika and Georg von Arnim. They dedicated themselves to the theme of the spiritual mission of Europe and the tasks of Camphill Communities in the Central European region (Steel, 2010/2011, p. 90). . . . And From the Night, Kaspar has been performed in different parts of the world over the years. \"Carlo Pietzner's Kaspar Hauser play was performed again and again in Camphill Communities at different occasions. Other Kaspar Hauser plays were performed, also\" (Metraux, personal communications, March 31, 2021). Kaspar Hauser has always been an important figure in Camphill. Some examples of the recent performances of . . . And From the Night, Kaspar are as follows. The German translation of . . . And From the Night, Kaspar was performed at the Goetheanum in Dornach, Switzerland, for the Michaelmas Conference in 2009 (Steel, 2010/2011, pp. 9-10). The play was dramatically read at the Kaspar Hauser Fest ival in California in 2016 (Baring, 2017, p. 31). In the east coast of the United States, . . . And From the Night, Kaspar was performed in Fountain Hall in Camphill Village Copake in Columbia County, New York, in autumn 2017 as part of the Kaspar Hauser Festival (Grace, 2018, p. 4). 121 . . . And from the Night, Kaspar continues to be a meaningful play. People learn about Kaspar Hauser and explore the meaning of life by learning about Kaspar Hauser. The Camphill Communities and Anthroposophic Communiti es in America As of March 2021, there are over 15 full and affiliated member -communities in the Camphill Association of North America (Camphill Association of North America, n.d.b). The communities are in both North and South America. Some more initi atives work out of anthroposophic curative education and social therapy in the US and Canada who are the members of the North American Council for Anthroposophic Curative Education and Social Therapy (The NAC) (The North American Council for Anthroposophic Curative Education and Social Therapy, n.d.). The seed that was started by Karl K \u00f6nig and Carlo Pietzner from the beginning of the 1960s spawned and has more initiatives in America serving people with special needs. Margrit Metraux spoke about how the impulse of Kaspar Hauser has been living in Camphill Communities. \"Although the impulse of Kaspar Hauser has been living in Camphill all the time, sometimes the impulse appears stronger than other times. Sometimes the story goes dormant. Then the sub ject of Kaspar Hauser comes up again! The story appears once in a while in the wider world, also\" (Metraux, personal communication, March 31, 2021). The story of Kaspar Hauser continues to live in Camphill and makes its presence known again and again. The story never ceases to appear. The Camphill School was founded in 1963 (The Camphill School, n.d.). Since then, The Camphill School has been serving children with special needs for over 55 years. Camphill Academy has its main office in The Camphill School. 122 [Camphill Academy] provides professional education and certification in the interdisciplinary field of Inclusive Social Development, including concentration in Curative Education, Social Therapy, Social Agriculture, and related fields through practice -integrated courses of studies embedded in the life and work of participating communities and organizations. It also offers continuing education in a variety of areas related to the work of the Camphill Movement. (Camphill Academy, n.d.) Rudiger Janisch is a curative educator in The Camphill School and a teacher of curative education in the Camphill Academy. He has spoken about how people who work in The Camphill School have connections to Kaspar Hauser and how the spirit of Kaspar Hauser lives in the community. Some people feel the connection to Kaspar Hauser more than others. There are those who hear about Kaspar Hauser, become very interested in him and learn more about him. And there are those who hear about him, enjoy hearing about hi m, but move onto other subjects of interest. Kaspar Hauser is introduced to the students of curative education and social therapy in the Camphill Academy in various ways. In one of the weekend retreats, the theme of Kaspar Hauser is taken up specifically. Several people in the Camphill School feel connected to Kaspar Hauser. Those who feel a deep connection to Kaspar Hauser in their hearts carry it quietly and intimately. They are the ones who also carry the deeper aspects of the Ca mphill Community's inner impulse . We should not be stuck on the question of \"who was Kaspar Hauser? Was he the hereditary prince or not?\" Through studying the extraordinary being of Kaspar Hauser, 123 we learn and wake up to the question of what it means to be human. In that sense, Kaspar Hauser is a topic that wider humanity can learn from, be touched by, and wake up to the question of what it means to be human. (Janisch, personal communication, August 20, 2020) Both younger and experienced healing educators strive to learn about Kaspar Hauser and carry the work of anthroposophic healing education. Opportunities are given to young people who come to Camphill Communities to learn about Kaspar Hauser. Healing Education and In Search of the Holy Grail Rene Querido (1991) wrote that the quest of the Holy Grail is one of the most important modern spiritual paths. Rudolf Steiner said that modern human beings would take up the stories of the Grail for inner development. There are a few notable Gr ail stories. One of the important Grail stories was Parzival written by Wolfram von Eschenbach (1980). Parzival was written in Middle High German in 1213 (p. 1). Rene Querido (1991) was a teacher at Waldorf schools for many years (p. 118). He is also the author of the book The Mystery of the Holy Grail: A Modern Path of Initiation . What is the quest of the Holy Grail? He wrote in his book as follows: What is the nature of the Holy Grail? It appears, at first sight, to be a quest for the chalice that conta ins the blood of Christ. But symbolically, esoterically, it represents much more than just search for a physical chalice or vessel containing the blood of Christ. Rather the quest represents the striving of the individual to obtain the highest, the purest truth and goodness within himself. (p. 40) 124 Rene Querido also characterized the quest as follows. \"The quest for the Holy Grail reflects in imaginative form the modern search for man's true being through stages of dullness and doubt to final spiritual awake ning\" (p. 20). Rudolf Steiner (1997) has written in An Outline of Esoteric Science about the human being's spiritual striving in the modern world and the development in relation to the quest of the Holy Grail. [The] hidden knowledge, which is taking hold of humanity from the other side and will do so increasingly in the future, can be called \"the knowledge of the Grail.\" If we learn to understand the deeper meaning of this symbol as it is presented in stories and legends, we will discover a significan t image of what has been described above as the new initiation knowledge with the Christ mystery at its center. Therefore, modern initiates can also be known as \"Grail initiates.\" (p. 388) The \"hidden knowledge\" can also be characterized as the knowledge of the spirit. Rudolf Steiner describes such knowledge as \"the knowledge of the Grail.\" The quest of the Holy Grail is a path that can \"guide the Spiritual in the human being to the Spiritual in the universe\" (Steiner, 1973/2007, p. 13). Anthroposophical Inner Path and the Grail: The Union of the Path of the Nathan Soul and the Wisdom of Zarathustra Sergei Prokofieff (2010/2011) spoke of the modern inner path of initiation at the Michaelmas Conference at the Goetheanum in 2009. Thus we are able to say both figuratively and literally: Only through the conscious union of the original forces of childhood in the Nathan soul and with the wisdom of Zarathustra 125 will we be in a position to create the foundation, the inner chalice, for t aking up the Christ in our souls. (p. 50) \"The inner chalice\" Prokefieff spoke about in the lecture is the Grail. \"The wisdom of Zarathustra\" signifies \"everything human civilization had produced by way of scholarship and learning\" (Steiner, 1950/2012, p. 189). \"Love and compassion, by contrast, bears many qualities and facets of the Nathan -quality\" (Prokofieff, 2010/2011, p. 53). Sergei Prokofieff (2010/2011) further stated as follows. This two fold path is also referred to implicitly in the foremost text of anthroposophical schooling, Knowledge of Higher Worlds and Its Attainment . The entire presentation in this book is built on two pillars: on the one hand, the practical exercises to be undertaken daily, and on the other hand, unfolding of moral qualities which effect the inner transformation of the human being. (p. 50) Rudolf Steiner's book The Knowledge of the Higher Worlds and Its Attainment is called How to Know Higher Worlds in newer translations. Prokofieff (2010/2011) stated when schola rship is united with the force of the heart , \"the original forces of childhood in the Nathan soul\" (p. 50), as Prokofieff has put it, our soul will become the grail -cup to receive Christ (p. 50). \"The original forces of childhood in the Nathan soul\" also s ignifies the \"unfolding of moral qualities which affect the inner transformation of the human being\" (p. 50). Kaspar Hauser possessed a pure soul like that of the Nathan soul. Becoming spiritually close to Kaspar Hauser brings about moral development. Let us remember what Rudolf Steiner had said about Kaspar Hauser and the potential of developing the new Grail -Castle. 126 Southern Germany should have become the new Grail -Castle of the new Knights of the Grail and the cradle of future events. The spiritu al background had been well prepared by all those personalities whom we know of as Goethe, Schiller, Holderlin, Herder and others. Kaspar Hauser was to have gathered around him, as it were, all that existed in this spiritual ground thus prepared. (Polzer -Hoditz, 1916, as cited in Tradowsky, 1980/2012, p. 278) As much as southern Germany may have had, and continue to have, the possibility to \"become the new Grail- Castle of the new Knights of the Grail and the cradle of future events,\" those who work on the a nthroposophical inner path of the union of the Nathan soul and with the wisdom path of Zarathustra will be able to find the Holy Grail wherever he or she lives. No longer, the development of spiritual work is limited to geographic areas. Through working on the anthroposophical inner path, \"the knowledge of the Grail\" can be found, and the Grail -Castle can be created anywhere on earth. The Development of the Pineal Gland, Conscience, and the Holy Grail Karl K \u00f6nig (2014/2016) gave many descriptions of the pineal gland in relation to spiritual development. His studies are written in The Grail and the Development of Conscience: St. Paul and Parsifal . If you study such a pineal gland under the microscope you will find that normally this tiny little organ, which is no bigger than a dried pea, is filled with the most beautiful calcium crystals which have a form only to be compared to tiny little rose peta ls. (p. 86) People today have not yet discovered the real function of this organ. So many experiments have been made to understand the pineal gland but today's scientists do not understand its real function yet (pp. 97-98). 127 This organ at present is nourished by the most noble impressions which stream into us through our ears and eyes, so that only the most refined and beautiful colours, the most subtle sounds and tones, enter this organ. Rudolf Steiner describes this organ as the Holy Grail in us. (p. 97) Karl K \u00f6nig learned through the work of Rudolf Steiner that the pineal gland is related to the development of the Holy Grail. What is this noblest part of our whole existence? What is the purpose of this very special organ? This pineal gland is the organ of our conscience. This organ of human conscience, which Steiner connected to the Holy Grail, is an organ that needs to develop more and more in future. (p. 87) Let us turn again to what people have said about Kaspar Hauser. Hearing people's descrip tions about Kaspar Hauser, and hearing the path of suffering he lived through, one wakes up to conscience within us. \"Georg Friedrich Daumer spoke of an 'angelic pure human being with the most refined sense of morality and the most rigorous love of truth.' and also of the 'paradisal innocence and purity' of Kaspar Hauser's being\" (as cited Selg, 2012, p. 39). Feuerbach wrote about Hauser's \"purest innocence and goodness of heart \" (as cited in Selg, 2012, p. 39). There are many noble impressions t hat nourish our senses and our hearts. Hearing about, studying about, and coming closer to the being of Kaspar Hauser gives such a noblest impression and nourishes our hearts. Transformation of the Astral Body and the Holy Grail Rudolf Steiner says t hat the human being' s future development will occur when the soul forces are transformed (Querido, 1991, p. 93). When the astral body develops completely out of 128 spiritual development, the astral body will radiate like the sun (K \u00f6nig, 2014/1016, p. 118). Steiner (1961/1994) says our drives, desires, and passions can be transformed (pp. 59 -60). When the astral body transforms, out of the forces of the \"I,\" the transformed astral body will be called the spirit self (p. 60). The spirit self is the fifth member of the human being (p. 61). When the human being goes through such a development, the human being can affect the world and bring about new positive world development. Parzival Asks \"What Ails Thee?\" In Parzival , written by Wolfram von Eschenbach, Parzival was finally ready to ask the right question and become the new Grail King after experiencing many trials and errors. Querido (1991) told that Parzival went through the stages of dullness, doubt, and spiritual awa kening (pp. 78-79). When Parzival was ready to go to the Grail castle, he was told that entering the Grail castle by himself would not be acceptable. In order to become the Grail King, Parzival had to take another person with him. Therefore he took his hal f-brother, Feirefiz, with him to the Grail castle (p. 79). In this experience, \"the path from the individual to the community, from separateness and alienation to union and togetherness, is accomplished\" (p. 79). This experience of Parzival is similar to how Kaspar Hauser experienced his spiritual mission in his dream. I was to assemble around me such men and women who would be able to read the signs of branches and who would thus become branches of a new order. They would flower with the radiance of freedom in their thoughts, each live with equal acceptance of one another and pulsing with the fraternal blood of the brotherhood to which I was called. I remember it, my brothers, I begin to remember . . . (Pietzner, 1983, 6. 686-695) 129 Kaspar Hauser's path was to gather men and women who could accept each other as equals and as brothers and sisters (Pietzner, 1983, 6. 690-693). The Grail King Amfortas was suffering from severe pain (Querido, 1991, p. 11). Von Eschenbach (1980) told that as Parzival entered the Grail castle with Feirefiz, Parzival was finally able to ask the right healing question to Amfortas. \"'Dear Uncle, what ails you'\" (p. 395)? Then Amfortas was released from pain and was healed (p. 395). Healing educators who are on the pat h of the Holy Grail must ask the question to the people the educators work with. \"What ails you?\" The question can be asked directly sometimes and sometimes only within the healing educators' minds. The Parzival question, therefore, can be called a healing education question also. Kaspar Hauser and the Recent Developments in the Twenty -First Century The Kaspar Hauser Festivals in Ansbach, Germany In Ansbach, where Kaspar Hauser lived the last few years of his life and died, Kaspar Hauser did n ot live in people's awareness very much for some years. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest to learn about Kaspar Hauser (Suesada, 2018, p. 8). Kaspar Hauser has been taken up as a theme for festive celebrations every other summer in Ansbach. The festivals have been called the Kaspar Hauser Festivals (Baring, 2017, p. 26). Eckart B \u00f6hmer founded his theater near Ansbach after completing his studies in theater direction. He started the Kaspar Hauser Festival in Ansbach (Kaspar Hauser Research Circle, n.d.). The festival has taken place every other summer since its inception in 1998. B \u00f6hmer (2019) talked about how he began the Kaspar Hauser Festival in his book Kaspar Hauser Child of Europe: An Artistic and Contemplative Approach to an E nduring Enigma. 130 In 1993, Peter Sehr's much acclaimed Kaspar Hauser film appeared, which was devoted entirely to the \"Hereditary Prince Theory.\" Following from this, the sensational genetic analysis of 1996 was carried out to \"prove\" that the foundling coul d not have been the hereditary prince of Baden. These events mark a clash in the way Kaspar Hauser was seen, in a way that had seldom occurred before. (p. 86) As mentioned in the chapter Who Was Kaspar Hauser?, \"the sensational genetic analysis of 1996\" wa s \"launched by Der Spiegel \" (p. 18) to claim that \"Kaspar Hauser was not the hereditary prince\" (pp. 18-19). These events really convinced me that the right time had to begin with a forward- looking aspect, no longer investing in the ultimate proof of eithe r one of those research directions. The quantum leap was to be made in order to recognize that the way Kaspar Hauser had been viewed and understood over more than 180 years has shown the deep reality of his significance. Now it was time to recognize this m ystery in all its vastness. (p. 87) In this chapter, I have long quotes from Eckart B \u00f6hmer, who is involved with the recent developments around the work with Kaspar Hauser. The long quotes are used as ways to hear the words from a person who is directly i nvolved with the new initiatives. Current initiatives are another manifestation of how the being of Kaspar Hauser is trying to connect, help, and heal the world. The Kaspar Hauser Research Circle Dr. Hermann Pies (1888 -1983) was one of the most devoted researchers of Kaspar Hauser in the twentieth century. Dr. Pies passed away in 1983. Then, Johannes Mayer, a publisher in Stuttgart, took over the administration of Dr. Pies's work. Mayer also resear ched Kaspar Hauser and added new material for Kaspar Hauser research. Thirty -three years later in 131 the twenty -first century, Johannes Mayer looked for a new person who would succeed the administration of the archive and commit oneself to Kaspar Hauser research. The compiled research material was passed onto Eckart B \u00f6hmer. Eckart B \u00f6hmer founded the Kaspar Hauser Research Circle. The inherited research material needed proper archiving for the future. This task will take place in cooperation with Richard Stee l and the Karl K \u00f6nig Institute (Kaspar Hauser Research Circle, n.d.c). \"Kaspar Hauser Research Circle became part of Karl K \u00f6nig Institute on December 17, 2016\" (Kaspar Hauser Research Circle, n.d.c). December 17 is the day on which Kaspar Hauser died. Eckart B \u00f6hmer (2019) spoke about the founding of the Kaspar Hauser Research Circle in his book. \"I was sure that it was no longer right to try and face these tasks alone, and so\u2014out of many conversations with you, Richard Steel, I founded the Kaspar Hauser Research Circle \" (p. 88). Eckart B \u00f6hmer 's statement was similar to the path of Kaspar Hauser. The path of Kaspar Hauser was \"to assemble around me such men and women who would be able to read the signs of branches and who would thus become branches of a new order \" (Pietzner, 1983, 6. 686-690). Eckart B \u00f6hmer also chose to walk this path with others. Eckart B \u00f6hmer (2019) also spoke about how the Kaspar Hauser Research Circle became part of the Karl K \u00f6nig Institute. With the Karl K \u00f6nig Insti tute for Art, Science, and Social Life you have created exactly the conditions that were now also necessary for such a project. There were already some competent specialists, there was the recognized non -profit status, as well as suitable premises for the administration and archiving work. In addition, Karl K \u00f6nig (1902- 1966) was also deeply connected to Kaspar Hauser. (p. 88) 132 Karl K \u00f6nig was again able to become the vessel for the spiritual impulse of Kaspar Hauser to incarnate in the twenty -first century through the Karl K \u00f6nig Institute. Today the Kaspar Hauser Research Circle and the Karl K \u00f6nig Institute are working together to bring about a new spiritual impulse to manifest on the earth. The Fifth Moon- Node Since The Curative Education Course was Given If the rhythm of the Moon- node is 18.6 years ( O'Neil, 1990, pp. 176, 177) , the fifth Moon- node since Rudolf Steiner gave The Curative Education Course in summer 1924 was around 2017. The fifth Moon- node approximately corresponded to the time of the founding of the Kaspar Hauser Research Circle. The Kaspar Hauser Festivals in the United States of America Kaspar Hauser has been known in Camphill Communities in the United States for years. Recently, there has been growing interest in being engage d in further research and bringing about initiatives about Kaspar Hauser. The Kaspar Hauser Festival took place in Camphill Communities California in Santa Cruz, California, in autumn 2016 as a result of collaboration between Santa Cruz and Monterey Bay Anthroposophical Society and Camphill Communities California. Eckart B \u00f6hmer and Richard Steel attended the festival as presenters (Baring, 2017, pp. 26-31). From November 1 to 5, 2017, the four Camphill Communities in Columbia County, New York, hosted the Kaspar Hauser Festival on the east coast. The four Camphill Communiti es in Columbia County, New York, are Camphill Triform Eckart B \u00f6hmer and Richard Steel attended as presenters (Grace, 2018, pp. 4-5). 133 In 2019, The Kaspar Hauser Festivals were celebrated in spring and autumn in North America. From March 29 to 31, The Kaspar Hauser Festival, which had the title \"Kaspar Hauser West II,\" took place in Camphill Communities California in Santa Cruz, California (Steel, 2019, pp. 2-4). From October 31 t o November 3, the four Camphill Communities in Columbia County, New York, hosted the second Kaspar Hauser Festival on the east coast. The title of the festival was \" Kaspar Hauser and the Grail \" (Grace, 2020, pp. 2-4). Eckart B \u00f6hmer and Richard Steel returned as presenters for the west coast and east coast festivals. All the Kaspar Hauser Festivals in the United States of America were organized in cooperation with the Kaspar Hauser Research Circle in Berlin, Germany. Lectures at the festivals covered a wide range of topics, such as Kaspar Hauser's spiritual origin, Kaspar Hauser's spiritual tasks, Kaspar Hauser's influence after death, etc. Various artistic events were also part of the festivals; plays, singing, poetry, music, eurythmy, puppet theater, etc. Most importantly, recognizing Kaspar Hauser as a wonderful human being was part of the festivals. The impulse to study Kaspar Hauser continued. \"In Camphill Ghent, there is a study group to study about Kaspar Hauser and nurture the spiritual im pulse after the Kaspar Hauser Festivals\" (Metraux, personal communication, March 31, 2021). Earnest striving to learn about Kaspar Hauser will continue and will lead to the next occasion when Kaspar Hauser is celebrated again. The Child of Europe: Kaspar Hauser Center for Healing Pedagogy According to Barbor (2018), no one has been living in the house in Ansbach in which Kaspar Hauser lived and died. There is now a plan to recreate this space into a place to host 134 seminars. There is also a plan to cre ate guest rooms and a restaurant. The renovated building will become a place where anyone interested can come and visit (p. 7). The idea for an inclusive seminar house concept has long existed in the minds of those involved. The owner is very motivated to preserve the building and is ready to invest significant money for the renovation. Currently involved with the project are the Friends of Waldorf Education, together with the Parzival School Karlsruhe, Eckart B \u00f6hmer from Kaspar Hauser Research Circle, and Richard Steel from the Karl K \u00f6nig Institute. (p. 7) Caroline Barber has written more about the project in Kaspar Hauser Research Circle Newsletter, Winter 2018 , as follows. The inclusive seminar house concept for healing pedagogy is broadly set up and wi ll offer jobs in guest services and housekeeping to people with disabilities. The plans include a Demeter restaurant and cafe, and a good 50 beds for hotels and conference guests as well as for seminar visitors. A large hall for cultural events, concerts and performances including two additional seminar rooms will provide sufficient space for workshops and seminars. (p. 7) \"The title of this house will be: THE CHILD OF EUROPE \u2014KASPAR HAUSER CENTER FOR HEALING PEDAGOGY\" (p. 7). \"The house is now scheduled to open in 2023\" (Steel, personal communication, April 5, 2021). What was translated as The Kaspar Hauser Center for Healing Pedagogy in 2018 is more recently translated as The Kaspar Hauser Center for Healing Education in Eckart B \u00f6hmer 's book. (B \u00f6hmer, 2019, p. 90) The book was published in 2019. When this house opens, people who will volunteer worldwide from the Friends of Rudolf Steiner will receive training first at The Child of Europe \u2014Kaspar Hauser Center for Healing 135 Education (B \u00f6hmer , 2019, p. 90). The volunteers who will help people with special needs in Camphill Communities and anthroposophical healing education initiatives worldwide will hear and learn about Kaspar Hauser before they will go to help the Children of Kaspar Hauser. Kaspar Hauser will continue to work for healing education. People all over the world will come in touch with the healing forces of the pure soul who will awaken people's understanding of the spiritual image of the human being. All those who wil l come to visit and all those who will go out to the world as volunteers from the Kaspar Hauser Center for Healing Education will have the opportunity to learn about Kaspar Hauser and wake up to human beings' potential to heal the world. In Kaspar Hauser Child of Europe: An Artistic and Contemplative Approach to an Enduring Enigma, Eckart B \u00f6hmer (2019) responded to an interview about the Kaspar Hauser Center for Healing Education. I think the most exciting thing that is just developing is that out o f the growing collaboration of people for the Festivals in Ansbach quite a new project is taking shape right in the old center of the town! At last the house where Kaspar Hauser lived at the end of his life and where he also spent his final three days on h is deathbed, is being renovated. But the exciting thing is that it will become a center for healing education! It is called \"The Kaspar Hauser Center for Healing Education\" and is developing out of a cooperation between five anthroposophical ventures; for Curative Education, for Trauma Pedagogy, International Emergency Services and International volunteers and with the Kaspar Hauser Research Circle. Just imagine that all those 2,000 volunteers that Friends of Waldorf Education sends out each year around the world, will have their training here in Kaspar's House and will hear about Kaspar Hauser before they get sent to wherever 136 they will serve for that year. Beyond this it will be a restaurant and conference centre run in accordance with the principles of \"in clusion,\" employing people with special needs. And in the future it will house the Kaspar Hauser Archive that is being created through our work. Apart from that people will be able to visit Kaspar's room and see the evidence of how it was in 1833! (p. 90) Among the people who will visit the Kaspar Hauser Center for Healing Education and the people who will go out into the world to volunteer, some will surely take up healing education as a profession in the twenty- first century. The Kaspar Hauser Center for Healing Education wishes to become a place where the legacy of Kaspar Hauser will live into future generations. The healing impulse of Kaspar Hauser will touch human hearts and emanate around the world for years. Concluding Remarks Karl K \u00f6nig (2008/2009b) wrote in The Child with Special Needs , \"Does not each of the so-called difficult to educate, retarded children come into life in a way similar to Kaspar Hauser? Poor, strange, and enigma and yet a blessing where they are met with an open heart \" (p. 151)? When Kaspar Hauser appeared in Nuremberg for the first time in 1828, he could not speak, could not walk, could not eat most of the food, did not know who his family was, etc. With the help of many people, he gradually learned basic human capacities, such as walking, speaking, and thinking. Even if he appeared without fundamental human capacities, he was a blessing for those who met him. People with special needs, too, are \"a blessing where they are met with an open heart .\" In this thesis, I researched and presented how Karl K \u00f6nig' s spiritual relationship with Kaspar Hauser had led Kaspar Hauser to become a spiritual guide for anthroposophic healing 137 education. Karl K \u00f6nig lived deeply with Kaspar Hauser during the foundi ng and the development of the Camphill Community. Such a legacy lives profoundly even today in the Camphill Community. Many people who live and work in the Camphill Community have deep relationships with Kaspar Hauser. The Camphill Community continues to be a vessel for Kaspar Hauser. Kaspar Hauser was a human being who possessed a pure soul like the first human being in paradise before the fall. Kaspar Hauser was as innocent as the Nathan child born to Joseph and Mary. He was the protector of the spiritual image of the human being. As it was represented in the figure of Faust and hovering child in the First Goetheanum, the innocence of the childhood forces brings \"light of the future\" to modern human beings (Raske, 1983a, p. 159). Kaspar Hauser possessed pure forces of childhood for the future. The being of Kaspar Hauser is the source of healing in the past, present, and future. The Thread from Kaspar Hauser to Today While working on this thesis, a thread that connected the appearance of Kaspar Hauser in 1828 to healing education today was discovered. To recapitulate, Richard Steel presented at the Kaspar Hauser Festival in 2017, a thread that was born from the appearance of Kaspar Hauser as the \"beginning of curative education,\" the work of Rudolf Ste iner who brought Anthroposophy and The Curative Education Course, Karl K \u00f6nig who built Camphill Communities worldwide and practiced curative education (Steel, 2017). This thread of \"the appearance of healing education impulse \" can be extended to today's p ractice of healing education in the twenty -first century. While becoming aware of such a thread, there are threads that connect the challenges and the darkness of the different times that extend until today. While Darwinism, the development of materialistic science, Social Darwinism, and World War II are elaborated (Steel, 2017), the 138 thread extends to today's challenges, namely the challenges to the spiritual image of the human being in the twenty- first century. One could also say that the challenges are for \"the true knowledge of the human being\" (Steiner, 2006, p. 52) as Steiner has put it. To become aware of such threads that would extend until today was an element of surprise while researching. Researching today's challenges to the spiritual im age of the human being will be future research to be engaged in. The Questions that Apply Any Time and Any Place The expression of the challenges today can be found in Carlo Pietzner's Kaspar Hauser play, . . . And from the Night, Kaspar . At the beginning of the play, the script says, \"Although the costumes (except for The Five) indicate Central Europe between 1820 and 1840, the play has no time and no place\" (Pietzner, 1983, p. 33). The play and the questions people live with in the play apply to life at any time and any place. Therefore, it could also be in the twenty -first century. The Five means the five young people who are in search of the meaning of life. One of The Five in the play spoke about the spiritual struggles while l iving in the highly technological modern world. We were told what we had to do and what to learn before we could start helping. O.K.,\u2014fair enough \u2014but what a lot of bunk it turned out to be! What bunk it made out of what we were wanting to do! I can hardly recall it when I look at all the crosses on my clip - board\u2014each one separates me a little stroke further from those we came to help \u2014 whatever helping may mean. So clever it is, just a little at a time, ever so little. Hook it off, check it off, another stroke, another line in the grid, another bit of the cage. Make a chart, draw the curves, the curves, my foot! Grind it all through the percentage machine and watch the meaningless 139 results roll out the otherside, filling the up -to-date, the in -depth journ als, piling up files, the accredited versions of all we came forward to change in the first place. (Pietzner, 1983, 1. 23-40) The spiritual emptiness young people experience and their wish to find the meaning of life continues in the twenty -first century. Their wishes to find the spiritual wellspring are even stronger today when cyber technology and mechanization are developing at an unprecedented speed. Karl K \u00f6nig wanted to awaken among the younger members of the Camphill Community, the awareness that in the \"revelation of children in need of special care,\" there lives an archetypal form the question of living and finding fulfillment as a human being in the modern world, and also that impulses of healing are to be found through a study of, and an encounter with, the figure of Kaspar Hauser. (Selg, 2012, p. 76) Through studying Kaspar Hauser, through meeting people with special needs, one wakes up to the question of what it means to be human. One also notices the healing potential the human being has for the world. \"Human Beings Shall Know Peace . . . \" Through Kaspar Hauser \"It is good to be a child of Kaspar Hauser \" (K\u00f6nig, 1995, p. 24). One of the children who appeared in Karl K \u00f6nig' s A Christmas Story said. Kaspar Hauser is the patron saint of th e people with special needs and is the protector of the image of God (K \u00f6nig, 1961/2012a, p. 29). He is the pure soul people with special needs connect to and is a \"blessing\" to all. Kaspar Hauser will continue to shed light on healing and will be a spirit ual guide for anthroposophic healing education in the twenty -first century. 140 I would like to end with the lines from a play written by Carlo Pietzner . . . And from the Night, Kaspar. The five young people, who are in search of the meaning of life, le arn about Kaspar Hauser. At the end of the play, they learn that through knowing Kaspar Hauser, human beings shall someday know peace. \"Here we stand: / Enigma of our time, / of unrecognized birth, / our secret in death, / speaking with new recollection: / In our hearts shall dwell good will / and men on earth shall know peace. / Shall know peace . . . \" (Pietzner, 1983, 7. 1014-1021) References 141 Allen, J.
