I love putting it on after a bath or shower, and I sit on the edge of the bed to give myself a massage.\" Alex Winkleman Zeplain | Founder at Hello My Tribe \"Geranium Cedarwood Body Polish alone made me feel like I walked into a luxurious spa. It left my skin feeling renewed and soft to the touch. The coconut sugar and jojoba oil made it the PERFECT exfoliate after a long day out in the sun.\" Cleo Sonski | Visual Designer \"The Jasmine Tuberose Body Salve is probably my favorite nourishing and hydrating body product ever. The texture is rich, skin absorption feels flawless and the scent is intoxicatingly divine!\" Andrea Emmerich | Ayurvedic Practitioner \"The Citrus Cardamom Hand Salve is so silky! It smells delicious - like meyer lemon and tangerine with a hint of peppery cardamom. The texture is smooth and rich without being at all sticky, and it fully absorbs, leaving my hands feeling moisturized and smooth. I'm obsessed!\" Kayra Raecke | Administrative Manager \"As a Mom of two littles, it is easy to become so wrapped up in loving someone else that you forget to love yourself. When you take the time to treat yourself the way you treat others though, like for me with my SpaRitual Earl Grey Body Polish, you find that you can stretch your love a little further.\" Dana Rodden | Mother of Two \"I think the formulation is what wows me most of all. Aloe vera leaf juice, jojoba, shea butter, and tamarind seed come together to create a moisturizing powerhouse. And the scent is out of this world: geranium and cedarwood. Think floral with an earthy note that just leaves me smiling!\" Sohpie Uliano | Lifestyle Expert A beauty brand inspired by...
