Study Questions: What are the safety and efficacy profiles of the AZD1222 (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) vaccine in a large, diverse population at increased risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the United States (US), Chile, and Peru? Methods: In an ongoing, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 clinical trial conducted at 88 sites in the US, Chile, and Peru; the safety, vaccine efficacy, and immunogenicity was investigated of two doses of AZD1222 (the AstraZeneca vaccine) compared to placebo in preventing the onset of symptomatic and severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) 15 days after the second dose in adults (with a target of 25% of participants 65 years of age). Between August 2020 and January 2021, 32,451 participants underwent randomization in a 2:1 ratio to receive AZD1222 (21,635 participants) or placebo (10,816 participants). Participants were monitored for symptoms and underwent serologic SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing; a subset of participants in the US (1,500 participants aged 18-55 years, 750 aged 56-69 years, and 750 aged 70 years) completed symptom diaries and had additional serologic assessment to evaluate reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the vaccine. Results: On 32,379 participants in the analysis, 88.7% were in the US, 6.8% in Chile, and 4.5% in Peru. Mean age was 50.2 \u00b1 15.9 years (22.4% of participants 65 years), and 55.6% were male; 79.0% were White, 8.3% Black, 4.4% Asian, 4.0% Native American or Native Alaskan, 2.4% multiple races or ethnic groups; and 22.3% were Hispanic or Latinx. Median follow-up was 61 (interquartile range, 1-129) days after the second injection. AZD1222 was associated with low incidences of serious and medically attended adverse events and adverse events of special interest (<0.1% thrombotic and thrombocytopenic events); with incidences similar to those observed in the placebo group. Solicited local and systemic reactions generally were mild or moderate in both groups. Overall estimated vaccine efficacy was 74.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.3-80.5; p < 0.001) and estimated vaccine efficacy was 83.5% (95% CI, 54.2-94.1) in participants 65 years of age. High vaccine efficacy was consistent across a range of demographic subgroups. In the fully vaccinated analysis subgroup, no severe or critical symptomatic COVID-19 cases were observed among the 17,662 participants in the AZD1222 group; eight cases were noted among the 8,550 participants in the placebo group (<0.1%). The estimated vaccine efficacy for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (nucleocapsid antibody seroconversion) SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and neutralizing antibodies increased after the first dose and increased further when measured 28 days after the second dose. Conclusions: The authors concluded that AZD1222 was safe and efficacious in preventing symptomatic and severe COVID-19 across diverse populations that included older adults. Perspective: Previous studies have documented the safety and efficacy of the AZD1222 vaccine in the United Kingdom and Brazil. This large study of >32,000 participants revealed an acceptable safety profile associated with the vaccine, and 74% overall vaccine efficacy. The study population may have been less diverse than intended (89% of participants were in the US and 79% were White), median follow-up was only 61 days, and the trial predated the appearance of delta and omicron variants now of concern. Additional reporting from the study cohort will be required to determine longer-term efficacy and efficacy in the setting of evolving virus variants of concern.
