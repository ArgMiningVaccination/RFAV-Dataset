In this session, while lying in a relaxed state, the subtle energy system of the client is assessed by the practitioner, and healing energy is channeled by the practitioner to the various chakras (energy centers) of the body. The energy body is cleared from any blockages that may be present and enables the life force energy that surrounds us to freely flow through the body, energizing and raising the vibration of the client's energy field. This session may or may not involve the laying of hands on the body to channel healing energy to the client. Using the tools of tuning forks that incorporate sound and vibration to foster countless healing effects, the chakra system is further cleansed and recharged. Information relevant to the client's individual healing process is often received by the energy healer and is discussed following the session. It is important to note, energy healing has a cumulative effect, and brings to the client's awareness any additional healing that may be required. This may be immediate or could occur sometime after an initial session. Therefore, it is recommended that several sessions be considered for the assistance of processing what may need healing and continuing the free flow of energy for the client in their healing journey. Sessions last 60 minutes and the cost is $85 per session.
