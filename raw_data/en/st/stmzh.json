Time tested solutions with long track records Cons Lifesaving medicine but not a replacement for emergency hospital interventions Oftentimes exoensive and rarely covered by insurance Usually a slower approach than surgery Requires significant patient participation oftentimes Requires persistence and is rarely a \"silver bullet\" one-and-done treatment. Some people get lucky, and get the desired result in a short period of time, but thats the exception, not the rule \"Conventional\" Medicine Pros Can Be Life saving emergency medicine Limited and lacking in followup care Double blind human studies Cons The bureaucracy of hospitals, insurance companies is enough to make you insane Double blind human studies Insurance companies dictate which treatments are necessary, not the doctors Clunky, dehumanizing, hard to navigate system Patients get lost in the system Lack of a sense of urgency to treat disease before it becomes problematic, and needs the \"nuclear\" option Lots of patients falling through the cracks and being severely or mortally wounded by negligence or other circumstances Overuse and overprescribing of harmful pharmaceuticals Overuse of antibiotics Dehumanizing Expensive (not just in money, but in time and frustration) Depersonalized/depersonalizing Little to no training in nutrition unless practitioner is a licensed nutritionist. *Healthy is a really tough word to pin down, but what is meant above, is \"not needing medical intervention,\" corrective or palliative. Medicine and health are a daily conversation you have with yourself. Healthy can mean so many things, but, was meant to anchor the other end of the spectrum - in emergency care or totally not needing care. **Conventional medicine is helpful and necessary, limited like every medical modality or area of expertise. Specialized knowledge is by its nature limited. A hammer can do a few things, but makes a very poor screwdriver, etc. ABOUT HOLISTIC MEDICINE \"Holistic Medicine\" is a vague term that refers to medical modalities that treat the body as a connected set of systems, rather than collection of disjointed organs. More and more people are turning towards \"holistic medicine,\" realizing the limitations of mainstream commercial medicine. There's a ton of information out there about holistic medicine and natural supplements and herbs etc. It can be overwhelming. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Naturopathic Medicine techniques provide a scaffolding to embrace \"holistic medicine\" without getting swept away in information overload, and disjointed ideologies. Q: What is holistic medicine? A: Here are 2 Definitions for Holistic Medicine that are useful, and not too vague. Holistic Definition: characterized by the belief that the parts of something are interconnected and can be explained only by reference to the whole. Characterized by the treatment of the whole person taking into account mental and social factors, rather than just the symptoms of an illness List of Holistic Medicine Modalities: Holistic Medicine includes but is not limited to: Acupuncture, Alexander Technique, aromatherapy, Ayurveda, biofeedback, chiropractic, crystal healing, energy healing, Feldenkrais Method, guided imagery, herbal medicine, holistic nutrition, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, iridology, Jin Shin Jyutsu, kinesiology, magnet therapy, massage therapy, meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), naturopathy, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), nutrition therapy, osteopathy, Pilates, Qigong, reflexology, Reiki, Shiatsu, sound therapy, Tai Chi, Tibetan medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), yoga, and Zero Balancing and Many more modalities - too many to list. Q: [Why holistic medicine is better](http://www.google.com/search?q=why%20holistic%20medicine%20is%20better) A: Which medicines are situationally most appropriate. There is no \"better\" without context. Which is better, division or multiplication? Neither, they do different things, and one has to hapen before another to get the correct answer. One of the hallmarks of holistic medicine is that it usually has fewer, and less disastrous side effects, and usually focuses on low risk high reward, safe, natural, time tested techniques. Holistic medicine would not be my first choice during a heart attack - that's for the Emergency Room...BUT, every day leading up to the heart attack and every day after, Holistic Medicine is the way to go. Holistic Medicine has an emphasis on day to day living - eating the right foods (not just \"eating healthy\" which means nothing, but eating foods for a reason), the right herbs and supplements, the right exercises for you in a given situation, the right stretches and meditations that you need to perform on a daily basis to have the best possible chance of recovery from a given disease, illness or procedure. In many ways, holistic medicine is the every day medicine, and emergent medicine (modern mainstream hospital medicine) is the drastic interventionary medicine. If you decide you only want to place your faith in drastic interventions, only when things break, rather than preventative maintenance, unfortunately, you're at greater risk for needless pain and suffering. Q: [Why holistic medicine is bad](http://www.google.com/search?q=why%20holistic%20medicine%20is%20bad) - Holistic Medicine is neither good nor bad. A: Holistic Medicine has its troubles and limitations like every medical profession/discipline: The Broad definition of \"holistic\" means that it includes basically everything that isn't modern medicine. People often think that \"natural\" means \"good.\" Tsunamis and snake venom are natural too, but depending where you're standing, they might not be \"good\" news. You CAN have too much of a good thing. Just because you heard it's good for you, and it's natural, or a vitamin, doesn't mean you can have as much as you want. \"Healthy,\" \"natural\" medicines can be dangerous too. Q: [Why alternative medicine is bette](http://www.google.com/search?q=why%20alternative%20medicine%20is%20better)r A: Is it? What context? what circumstances? Q: [Why alternative medicine](http://www.google.com/search?q=why%20alternative%20medicine) A: It's good to have options. Its great to have low risk (side effect) high reward (positive gain and relief of suffering) Q: [Why integrative medicine](http://www.google.com/search?q=why%20integrative%20medicine) A: Since medicine is so specialized and compartmentalized, patients have to see many different doctors for different things. Having those doctors being willing to talk to each other on your behalf, and work together for your health; That's why integrative medicine. Does your MD talk to your gastro, talk to your OBGYN, talk to your ONCO, talk to your acupuncturist? Probably not, and that's a problem. Q: [When did holistic medicine originate](http://www.google.com/search?q=when%20did%20holistic%20medicine%20originate) A: How old is medicine? How old is science? How old is medical science? Q: [Is holistic medicine real](http://www.google.com/search?q=is%20holistic%20medicine%20real) A: Are there connections among seemingly disconnected systems? Does the Sahara desert connect to rainfall in the Amazon? If there is a connection, then yes, holistic medicine is real. Q: [Does holistic medicine work](http://www.google.com/search?q=does%20holistic%20medicine%20work) A: It certainly can, provided you find someone who knows what they're doing, and they do the right things at the right time in the right order, but even still there is chance and unpredictability. We can't know what's going to happen, we can't know the future or how anybody will react to a given medicine - we can make educated guesses, and probability tables, but there is no guarantee. The answer is - It depends. All medical science involves probability - if you have a headache, and we give you aspirin, you'll probably have less of a headache. If you take baby aspirin, there's a decreased chance of having a heart attack. Doctors and surgeons talk about statistics and probability all the time. But why is there a headache? How do you treat heart disease before it ever manifests? Q: [Is holistic medicine covered by insurance](http://www.google.com/search?q=is%20holistic%20medicine%20covered%20by%20insurance) A: Some insurance plans cover things like acupuncture, massage therapy, Naturopathic medicine, some do not. Call your insurance company and give them a hard time for not covering natural medicine (just be kind while you do it). Q: [Does holistic medicine really work](http://www.google.com/search?q=does%20holistic%20medicine%20really%20work) A: Like any other medicine, when it's the right medicine for the job, it works. I've seen frozen shoulders that would have probably \"needed surgery\" cleared up with one acupuncture treatment, on more than one occasion. Q: Is Holistic Medicine Pseudoscience? A: No. Holistic Medical Sciences, Traditional Medicine(s), Indigenous Medical Sciences, Ancestral Medical Sciences, Culturally Significant Medical Sciences are not devoid of the scientific model. Science was not invented with when the microscope was born, nor was it when germ theory happened. When did science begin? Was there scientific rigor before the double blind placebo became the gold standard? I find it hubris to believe that the rigor of investigation into cause and effect, and the true nature of things is not a cross cultural phenomena. There's racism tied up in blanketing anything other than the party line, pseudoscience. If you look, you'll spot it. Wikipedia and many other sources like to discredit anything that isn't mainstream medicine - this is also marketing tactic to discredit dissent and hoard market share. Don't forget holistic medicine includes, but isn't limited to: Acupuncture, Alexander Technique, aromatherapy, Ayurveda, biofeedback, chiropractic, crystal healing, energy healing, Feldenkrais Method, guided imagery, herbal medicine, holistic nutrition, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, iridology, Jin Shin Jyutsu, kinesiology, magnet therapy, massage therapy, meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), naturopathy, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), nutrition therapy, osteopathy, Pilates, Qigong, reflexology, Reiki, Shiatsu, sound therapy, Tai Chi, Tibetan medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), yoga, and Zero Balancing. Some of these, namely Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda are 1000's of years old. So to the question, is holistic medicine pseudoscience? No. When was science invented? When was science discovered? That's how old medical science is. Holistic medicine is based on connections - connections of different organ systems to each other, connections of us to our world. Humanity has been witnessing these things since there was humanity. The word pseudoscience is used more widely to discredit valid medical paradigms than it is used to increase patient knowledge, therefore the word is a hindrance. Q: [Can holistic medicine cure depression](http://www.google.com/search?q=can%20holistic%20medicine%20cure%20depression) A: Holistic medicine can help manage, minimize, reverse, and sure maybe even cure depression. There's lots of options in the holistic medicine umbrella that can help. The issue is with the word \"Cure.\" What does that mean? Can it help to remedy depression, yes, and in many situations it may be a better choice than pharmaceuticals, but this is case by case and situationally dependent. Q: [Is holistic medicine real](http://www.google.com/search?q=is%20holistic%20medicine%20real) A: 88% of all countries are estimated to use traditional medicine, such as herbal medicines, acupuncture, yoga, indigenous therapies and others. [According to the WHO] Q: [Can holistic doctors prescribe medication](http://www.google.com/search?q=can%20holistic%20doctors%20prescribe%20medication) A: Depends where you live, where the doctor lives, type of medication, your condition, etc. Q: [Can holistic doctors diagnose cancer](http://www.google.com/search?q=can%20holistic%20doctors%20diagnose%20cancer) A: Some holistic doctors can spot the warning signs, but have to refer (legally) to an oncologist to do this. PET scans, CT scans, other specialized testing may be a more reliable diagnosis, though preventative, and recovery interventions with herbs, supplements, acupuncture and the like may be preferred. I believe the early doctors would have used these technologies if they had them. However, Do oncologists/Does modern oncology have the best treatments for every cancer in every situation? Ask an oncologist what foods you should eat if you hav cancer [I'm yet to hear a real answer]. That's the question I'm interested in here - what are the lifestyle changes that need to be made to give a patient the best opportunity of survival? Q: [Can holistic doctors help with anxiety](http://www.google.com/search?q=can%20holistic%20doctors%20help%20with%20anxiety) A: Yes - but how and to what extent depends on the practitioners, patients and other variables. Q: [How does holistic medicine work](http://www.google.com/search?q=how%20does%20holistic%20medicine%20work) A: Holistic practitioners help patients come back into harmony with their worlds, and with themselves. No doctor heals you, you heal you - Doctors are responsible for making sure the conditions are right for healing to happen as quickly as possible. Q: [How to learn about holistic medicine](http://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20learn%20about%20holistic%20medicine) A: Find someone, a school, a program or course that teaches you the following: Acupuncture, Alexander Technique, aromatherapy, Ayurveda, biofeedback, chiropractic, crystal healing, energy healing, Feldenkrais Method, guided imagery, herbal medicine, holistic nutrition, homeopathy, hypnotherapy, iridology, Jin Shin Jyutsu, kinesiology, magnet therapy, massage therapy, meditation, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), naturopathy, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), nutrition therapy, osteopathy, Pilates, Qigong, reflexology, Reiki, Shiatsu, sound therapy, Tai Chi, Tibetan medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), yoga, and Zero Balancing etc. ...and ask them to teach you. Q: [How to practice holistic medicine](http://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20practice%20holistic%20medicine) A: Apprenticeship is my preferred method. Many modalities require special schooling licenses and insurance. Q: [Are holistic doctors covered by insurance](http://www.google.com/search?q=are%20holistic%20doctors%20covered%20by%20insurance) A: They should be!! But usually no. Call your insurance companies to ask. Also, call your insurance companies regularly and badger them to cover the wonderful, safe, merciful medicines! Try to be kind. Q: [Are alternative medicine effective](http://www.google.com/search?q=are%20alternative%20medicine%20effective) A: Provided you get the right medication for the right condition, in the right dosage at the right time, by a well trained practitioner, they stand a better chance at being effective. Is insulin effective? It depends what for. For toothaches? Probably not. Good question, ask again more specifically - are alternative medicines effective for _______? Or, what medicines or alternative medicine practices are helpful for ______? Q: [Holistic medicine is quackery](http://www.google.com/search?q=holistic%20medicine%20is%20quackery) A: Yes it is quackery, and they call it that because every practitioner of medicine who is not an AMA Medical Doctor with a MD degree from an accredited medical school in the United States, is actually, by definition, no exaggeration, a duck. It's true, we all have webbed feet, thats why they tell us NEVER to wear open toe shoes in duck school. [Q: What is the difference between holistic and natural medicine](http://www.google.com/search?q=what%20is%20the%20difference%20between%20holistic%20and%20natural%20medicine) A: Depends on the conversation. Are these marketing terms? What constitutes \"natural?\" Is natural not holistic? Is holistic not \"natural\"? Good question, try asking a more specific question to get the answer you're looking for. Q: [Alternative medicine with definition](http://www.google.com/search?q=alternative%20medicine%20with%20definition) Holistic medicine is defined as any medicine that isn't \"mainstream\" medicine. Q: [Alternative medicine is better than conventional](http://www.google.com/search?q=alternative%20medicine%20is%20better%20than%20conventional) A: There is a lot of information out there to discredit natural/holistic approaches like TCM traditional Chinese medicine and Naturopathic medicine. There is no reason most people can't find some measure of relief from herbs/supplements, diet, exercise, stretching, yoga, talk therapy, naturopathic, traditional chinese medicine, acupuncture, tui na, etc. The patient and the doctors must come to some agreement over logical plans and order of operations. Remember in school when they would tell you that math equations had to be done in a certain order? In our school it was PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponent, multiply, divide, add subtract. If you did those in order, you would get the right answer. Medicine is much the same. Order matters. Sometimes you have to see an oncologist or a cardiologist, maybe you need interim medications, like a bridge, to get you from where you are right now to where you need/want to go. What herbs, supplements, foods, exercises, and treatment modalities in what order are needed to get you where you're going? Order matters, dosage matters, purity matters. Myths about Natural Medicine: Myth: Natural doesn't always mean \"safe\" or \"good\" It's always possible to misuse or overdose on \"good, safe, natural\" medicines. Well intentioned advice or efforts might not always work the way we envision. It's really a good idea to have people walk you through the \"why\" herbs or supplements are a good idea or when they're a bad idea. Supplements like ginseng are fantastic medicines but not meant to be taken indefinitely. All medicine needs to be approached with respect, especially in regards to toxicity and dosage. Right mount of medicine + correct treatment + correct timing + correct dosage + correct # of doses = Correct Treatment Myth: Herbal means good At the time of writing this, the norm has been to be prescribed some palliative medication or drug, indefinitely, meaning without an end date or circumstance. In East Asian and Naturopathic medicine, we almost never prescribe an herb or supplement Myth: Modern and Western Medicine is bad Things have become complicated with for-profit medicine in the modern world. Modern medicine isn't inherently good or bad, pills aren't inherently good or bad, there is much context to consider. We should be asking is western/modern medicine the best approach for a given situation? What are the alternatives? What ways can we mitigate the effects of modern Medicine, and avoid using it in low reward, high risk situations. These are just a few things to consider - can you think of more? More myths? More things to consider? Statistics Mediocrity, rampant neglect and medical error, over-diagnosis, and never-ending referrals - this isn't right, we deserve better. This practice is meant to be an answer to the need for caring, honest, transparent, effective, safe, natural, treat it at the root medicine.
