Today, shamans continue to heal through shamanic methods and practices. The Huichol native tribe of Mexico has practiced its sacred healing traditions for millennia. Unlike most of the indigenous cultures of the Americas, the Huichol never had a warrior class. Instead, they devoted all of their time and efforts to spiritual endeavors, working on polishing their ancient healing and ceremonial arts. When the Spanish conquistadores arrived in what is now Mexico, many of the indigenous tribes fought to defend their territory and were soon defeated. The Huichol, on the other hand, retreated into the remote regions of the high Sierras, to their sacred pilgrimage sites. Because of this smart move, the Huichol have kept their ancient traditions alive unto this day. They continue to perform ceremonies to celebrate the seasons and to honor the spiritual power of nature. Healings and blessings are an everyday occurrence in native life. The shamans act as doctors for the entire community, helping to cure all forms of sickness, both spiritual as well as physical. It is because of this that Huichols shamans are so revered. In the past few decades, even Mexicans have begun to search out Huichol shamans to cure an illness or ailment. Today, people in the modern world have been gifted with the opportunity to experience this ancient healing practice through Huichol shaman and healer Brant Secunda.
