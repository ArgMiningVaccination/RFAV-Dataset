attend classes for three consecutive days or more due to illness or injury should alert the Dean of Students Office. Notifications by the Dean of Students Office will be sent to each professor of the student currently not able to attend classes d ue to medical reasons. Thomas Jefferson University Health Services does not provide \"sick notes\" for students to professors for brief absences from class due to illness. We encourage students to communicate directly with their professors about their absenc es. This is meant to encourage mature communication between student and professor, as well as encourage personal responsibility for class attendance decisions. Absences due to illness do not supersede the specific attendance policy for an instructor. Stude nts are required to contact their professors about their academic standing in class either during or immediately following the medical problems. The determination of a student's academic standing in class is completely within the discretion of the individu al instructor. If a student is diagnosed with a communicable illness that poses a possible threat to the University community, a general notification may be sent to those at risk for exposure to the illness per the recommendation of the Philadelphia Healt h Department. Efforts will be made not to disclose the infected student's name. The University cannot assume responsibility for deductions and assumptions made by others, but will make every effort to anticipate and address any concerns. Students who are diagnosed with a communicable disease and those not immunized against an offending vaccine -preventable disease may be required to leave campus until their illness is resolved. For information, contact the Student Health Center at 215.951.2986. Academic S tanding Policy Statement A student's academic standing is based on the results of their academic performance at Thomas Jefferson University calculated and evaluated every semester in which the student is enrolled including summer and abbreviated terms. Definitions Good Standing: A. Undergraduate Students are determined to be in Good Standing when they meet all of the following criteria: cumulative GPA (Grade Point Average) at or above 2.0 and successful completion of at least 75% of all credits that appear on their transcript. B. Graduate Students are determined to be in Good Standing when they meet or exceed a 3.0 cumulative GPA. C. School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) students are determined to be in Good Standing when they meet or exceed a cumulat ive GPA of 2.0 following their first twelve 4 (12) attempted academic hours. Students who are not in good academic standing after attempting 12 academic hours will be placed on Academic Probation and may attempt an additional 12 hours to be restored to Good Standing. Academic Probation: Students who fall below the minimum GPA are placed on Academic Probation. Academic probation is a means of emphatically informing students that their record is unsatisfactory while there is stil l time to remedy the situation. Probation is not meant to be a penalty, but should be interpreted as a serious warning to improve the quality of academic work. Academic Dismissal: Students who fail to bring their cumulative GPA to or above the minimum standard by the conclusion of the next academic term of enrollment are dismissed from the university School of Continuing & Professional Studies (SCPS) - the next review period occurs after the completion of an additional 12 credits, which is not necessarily the next academic term of enrollment. Components Conditions of Academic Probation Official notification of probation will be in writing and sent directly to the student by the Program Director Students will be required to sign a student success contract with their Advisor (document found on Academic Success Center website) Student must meet with their advisor upon being placed on probation regularly throughout probationary period Placement on Academic Probation may also place the student on financial aid probation and are advised to meet with Financial- aid to discuss this Student is not permitted to take more than a normal course load and may be required to take a reduced course load Student will not be able to participate in intercollegiate athletics or hold an elected or appointed office in any SGA -recognized student organization Student should reduce the number of hours of employment whenever possible and limit participation in any other extracurricular activities that interfere with the performance of their academic work. Academic Standing and Grade Change 5 If a grade change results in a student's GPA rising to Good Standing, he/she may notify the Registrar's Office to request a change in Academic Standing; reassessment is not automatic and must come from a request to reassess standing. Academic Standing and Change of Major Students must meet the admissions criteria for the program to which they will be applying. This policy also applies to a student who chooses to change the ir original program for any reason. A student who does not meet the program -specific \"Satisfactory Academic Progress\" requirements of their undergraduate or graduate program may apply to transfer to another academic program within Thomas Jefferson University. Academic Dismissal Notification and Appeal Options Student will receive written notification of academic dismissal Student may appeal for reinstatement by submitting a written request for reinstatement to the chair and sub -committee chair by the date listed in the dismissal letter. (See Appeal Process) School of Continuing and Professional Studies (SCPS) - students should submit a written appeal for reinstatement to the SCPS Director of Student Services Academic Internships An internship is a form of experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a professional setting. Internships provide students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make conn ections in the professional fields they are considering for career paths. Academic internships at Jefferson -East Falls aid students in professional preparation through a work experience directly related to their major and career goals. All academic interns hips must meet the NACE criteria for an experience to be considered an internship (visit www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/careerservices/Internships/index for details). Academic internships are offered during the fall, spring and 12 -week summer term. Multiple graduate -level internship options exist in 0.5 credit, 1 credit, or 3 -credit increments. Students may only enroll in an internship course during the semester of the internship experience; credit is not issued retroactively or for future experiences. All internships for credit are completed as academic courses based in a course syllabus focuses on professional skill- building and written assignments. While the primary emphasis of the course is on the internship work experience, course assignments are incorporated to prompt reflection on the internship. This reflection is an integral component of experiential learning and a student's overall career and professional development. The Career Services Center and designated Faculty Internship Advisor (FIA) from the student's major provide support and guidance during the semester of participation. Career Services staff is also available to assist students with internship search strategies prior to the internship. 6 At the conclusion of the internship semester, all students are evaluated by their employer and FIA, receiving a grade derived from successful performance as determined by the employer, the quality of academic assignments submitted to faculty, and completion of minimum required hours. Graduate internships (when administered by the Career Services Center) require a minimum of 12 weeks in length and a minimum of 144 hours per semester on site. All required hours and coursework must be completed within the semester dates for which the student is enrolled in the internship course. Internship course registration may only occur once an offer has been received and accepted from the employer. Several steps are required in order to register, and the Registrar's Office ultimately enrolls each student in the internship course once all required paperwork is completed and submitted. The deadline to register for academic internships is the last day to add class for the semeste r of intended participation as established by the Registrar's Office. (Refer to the academic calendar for specific dates.) Students are strongly encouraged to apply early and to contact Career Services for assistance, which provides the best success in fin ding an appropriate experience in time to meet registration deadlines. To learn more about the registration process, visit www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/careerservices/Internships/InternshipsForCredit/index . All full- time and part -time students are encouraged to participate in academic internships. Minimum Requirements for Participation: Good academic standing within one's academic program Maint ain full- time status during the regular academic year International Students: Meet criteria above as relevant to program enrollment Must be eligible for Curricular Practical Training (CPT) - contact the Office of International Student Programs and visit www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/careerservices/internships for details. Note: Students not meeting minimum requirements may be considered by submitting a formal appeal. Contact Car eer Services for additional information.

Implementation Date : Summer 2018 Appeal of Adverse Decisions Students have the right to appeal decisions that are made regarding them by any faculty, official or committee of the University. The Dean or Program Director can advise students on the appeals process. Students should first discuss the decision with the individual who mad e the adverse decision. If a satisfactory resolution of the problem cannot be reached at that level, students may file a 7 subsequent appeal with the dean or the person to whom that faculty or staff member reports. In the event a satisfactory resolution cann ot be reached at that level, or if there is no intermediary, an appeal may be submitted to the Dean of the College or School. The Dean is the final appeal. In the event a University committee rendered a decision, the student may file a second appeal with that same committee if there is new information that would have a bearing on the outcome of the case. The University committee is the final appeal. For additional information see http:/ /www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/studentgrievances/ .

If the subject is not covered by the national testing agencies (see National Testing Agencies), a student may receive credit for courses offered by the University by making arrangements for an examination to be given by the college offering the course. Satisfactory evidence of adequate and appropriate preparation must be presented before the examination is prepared. If it appears that the student has adequate prepar ation, the student pays a fee (sum of 1 credit), presents the receipt to the college manager of academic operations, and takes an examination. The college will send the Office of the University Registrar the receipt for the examination fee along with writt en notification of a passing grade for the examination. Only one examination will be allowed for any one course. Students are ineligible for a challenge examination if they have previously enrolled in or audited the same course at Thomas Jefferson Universi ty. See \"Financial Information.\" Computer Resources The Office of Information Resources (OIR) is responsible for management, operation, security and support of the information -technology environment at Jefferson -East Falls. In accordance with established policies, all members of the Thomas Jefferson University community are responsible for effective, efficient, ethical and acceptable use of information resources. Course -by-Appointment (CBA) The intended course -by-appointment must currently exist in the University catalog, i.e. course number and course name already have been created by the Registrar. All prerequisites for the existing course must have been met prior to the CBA. A written proposal detailing how the existing syllabus will be modified to allow equivalent classroom experiences during the term must be attached to the required approval form. This form is obtained online at the University Registrar's website at www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registar and, if approved, the student must submit the form to the Registrar before the \"last day to add\" deadline (see Academic Calendar). Further details are provided on the form. Students may also be permitted to take CBA for an existing catalog course that a nticipates low enrollment. In such cases the University Registrar lists such courses on the master schedule without indicating days or times. The assigned faculty member subsequently contacts all students who register, and a mutually convenient day and tim e is established. The completed form, with the required signatures, will be submitted to the manager of academic operations of the college in which the course is given, or the School of Continuing and Professional Studies if appropriate, and must be presen ted to the Registrar before the \"last day to add\" deadline. 10 The University reserves the right to identify courses that may not be taken by appointment regardless of scheduling conflict or anticipated date of graduation. See \"Independent Study. Course Descriptions Descriptions for courses offered at the East Falls campus can be found online at http://www.jefferson.edu/handbook. Credit Hour Definition of a \"Credit Hour\" - Semester Credits The calculation for credit hour for all courses at Thomas Jefferson University is consistent with the U.S. department of Education and the Pennsylvania Department of Education credit hour definition as defined below. U.S. Department of Edu cation: The Code of Federal Regulations, Title 34: Education, Part 600. Institutional eligibility under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended. Subpart A -General Section 600.2 states the following: Credit hour : Except as provided in 34 CFR 668.8(k) and (l), a credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than \u2014 (1) One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit, or ten to twel ve weeks for one quarter hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or (2) At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institut ion including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours. Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE): 22 Pa. Code, Chapter 31, 31.21 -31.22. \"A semester credit hour represents a unit of curricular material that normally can be taught in a minimum of 14 hours of classroom instruction, plus appropriate outside preparation or the equivalent as determined by the faculty\". Thomas Jefferson University's formats and modes of instruction appear below based on the calculation of these modes of delivery for one credit hour per week: Lecture : A credit hour is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction an d a minimum of two hours of out -of-class student work each week for approximately 15 weeks. 11 Laboratory/Studio : The conventional suggestion is two hours of instruction and at least four hours of work outside of class in the semester. Independent Study : In addition to earning credits through formal courses, students may earn credit through a supervised learning experience in which the student plays a significant part in determining the learning objectives and anticipated outc omes. An independent study provides students a unique opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor, while studying a subject of their own choice. This learning experience, however, should not duplicate the content of an existing catalog course. The me eting time established by student and faculty must meet the minimum instructional time and out of class student work per week as in the established time for lectures, labs or studios. Additional requirements are detailed in the current catalog, and each Sc hool/Program may have requirements beyond those at the University level. Internship: An internship is a form of experiential learning that integrates knowledge and theory learned in the classroom with practical application and skills development in a prof essional setting. Internships provide students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. Academic internships at Thomas Jefferson University aid students in profes sional preparation through a work experience directly related to their major and career goals. All academic internships must meet the NACE criteria for an experience to be considered an internship. Details can be found at: www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/careerservices/students/internships . When administered by the Career Services Center, internships require a minimum of 12 weeks in length and a minimun of 144 hourse on -site. All required hours and coursework must be completed within the semester dates for which the student is enrolled in the internship course. Course by Appointment : Students may be permitted to take a \"course- by-appointment\" for an existing catalog course. The assigne d faculty member subsequently contacts all students who register, and a mutually convenient day and time is established. The course follows the normal syllabus, assignments, and examinations. Additional requirements are detailed in the current catalog and each School/Program may have requirements beyond those at the University level. Clinicals/Rotations/Fieldwork/Preceptorship: These learning experiences occur outside of a class setting with directed activity and a faculty member in contact with the studen t to ensure student outcomes are reached. Typically, the learning experience occurs outside of a lecture setting with directed activity. The experience may involve a site supervisor or a preceptor. Student activities may include experiences where the student is directly involved with the evaluation and management of patients/clients displaying the level of knowledge and skills learned during instruction, hours in a clinical/office setting, attending to patients/clients and partaking in continuing medical/ed ucation seminars, demonstrating the connection between academic learning and real world application in a clinical/office setting and documenting, reflecting and chronicling their learning and accomplishments. Due to the wide variety of programs the actual activities students participate in may differ, but all activities must meet at least the minimum credit hour requirement for lab/studios. (The majority usually go well beyond this requirement). 12 Online : Thomas Jefferson University follows the definition of Distance Education/Distance Learning consistent with HEOA, PDE and Middle States standards and guidelines for all distance learning degree or certificate programs. Online education is an alternate format to onsite based instruction using various technologies to deliver faculty directed instruction to students who are not physically present in an onsite setting. These methods could be synchronously or asynchronously and technologies may include but are not limited to the internet; one -way and two -way transmissions through open broadcast, discussion boards, satellite, wireless communications devices; audio conferencing; or Video cassettes, DVDs, and CD -ROMs, when used in a course in conjunction with any of the technologies listed. All our online courses satisfy the PDE guidelines for \"equivalent instruction\". See below for PDE parameters for curricular content that that are equivalent to classroom based instruction. (PA Code 31.21) According to PDE clarification, equivalent content: should be related directly to the objectives of the course/program, should be measurable for grading purposes. should have the direct oversight or supervision of the faculty member teaching the course should in some form be equivalent of an acti vity conducted in the classroom. PDE states that equivalent content may not be: homework assignments focused on \"time spent,\" that is, the amount of time the student spends accomplishing the task Hybrid: Hybrid courses are a combination of onsite (face -to-face) and online formats. The instruction hours must reflect the total of both methods and comparable time to out of class requirements as in traditional onsite courses. Accelerated Courses : Thomas Jefferson University offers courses that are out side of the standard 15 week semester. Courses in the College of Continuing and Professional Studies are offered in 8 week terms. These courses go through the same curriculum governance as courses in the standard semesters and are subject to the same stand ards. All accelerated courses must meet the required instruction time and out of class work time as defined for their traditional counterparts. Short Courses : These are Faculty -led short courses away or abroad. These courses provide students with apprecia tion and understanding of the global or national environments. Short away courses help students value intercultural/diversity experiences as they develop an ethical & professional awareness of their discipline within the global/national community. Students also gain insight into the historical, cultural, social, political and geographic contexts of the site of study while applying their resourcefulness, flexibility, interdependence and the 13 ability to collaborate and work in a group. All short courses whether away or abroad, must meet the required instruction time as traditional onsite courses. Academic Year : It is important to note that regardless of terms, format or mode of delivery, all programs in all terms follow the established credit hour definition. Traditional Programs - All traditional programs at Thomas Jefferson University follow the standard semester format with Fall and Spring semesters totaling a minimum of 30 weeks of instructional time. (DOE CFR Title 34 66 8.3 #1i) These weeks do not include reading days or final exams. The traditional programs also utilize the twelve week summer term or the two six week summer terms. The resident Continuing and Professional Studies programs have five eight -week terms which consist of two eight -week Fall terms, two -eight week Spring terms and one eight- week summer term. The Online Continuing and Professional Studies programs has six eight -week terms which consist of two eight -week Fall terms, two eight- week Spring terms and t wo eight -week summer terms. The Disaster Medicine and Management program as approved by the state has four twelve- week terms (Fall, Winter, Spring and Summer). Determining and Monitoring Amount and Level of Credits : Credit hours are determined by the faculty and the college deans in collaboration with the University Registrar's Office which enforces the credit hour policies listed above. All curriculum proposals go through the East Falls Academic Opportunities and Oversight committee and are approved by t heir College Education Committees. These committees guide, review, evaluate, and coordinate curriculum proposals for all curriculum in the university. All undergraduate courses indicate the number of credits proposed and the number of hours for lecture, la b etc. per week for the course e.g 3-2-3 which indicates that this 3 -credit course will have 3 hours of lecture and 2 hours of Lab/Studio instruction per week. The graduate courses specify the number of credits for the proposed course and the syllabi show the weekly task/instruction. Furthermore, at the submission of the semester course schedule the Registrar's office reviews all submissions to ensure they are meeting the credit hour requirement. Program Review and Content Specialty Accreditation: Through the regular process of Program Review as well as individual program accreditation, credit hour assignment is monitored by the colleges themselves and visiting accrediting teams. Credit by Exam (waiver examinations) Students may request to take a waiver examination instead of taking a course. The student must have experience in the field covered by the course or must have studied it elsewhere. Students may take waiver examinations for up to two courses in their degree programs. Credits earned by a waiver examination are not considered transfer credits. The cost of taking a waiver examination is equivalent to one credit hour of the current graduate tuition. Consult with your program director for specific details. 14 Credit/No credit Some graduate courses are graded on a \"Credit/No Credit\" (CR/NC) basis. To obtain credit for these courses, students must earn the equivalent of a \"B -\" or better in the course. The grade point average will not be affected whether credit is received for the course or not. Cross Level Course A cross level course is a course offered at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Graduate expectations are to be commensurate with the level of graduate course listed. Requirements for the graduat e course must clearly delineate greater expectations in quantity and/or quality for the graduate students appropriate to the field of study as determined by the program director. The expectations may be differentiated through any of the following methods: additional or higher level learning objectives assessment methods adjusted grading rubrics additional or alternate topical work, assignments, readings and/or activities Degree Options The following are degree options outside of the standard graduate degree programs. Offerings for these types of degree programs may be found at eastfalls.jefferson.edu/catalog/Introd uction/GradABList . \"2+\" Option A \"2+\" undergraduate pathway for students completing pre -professional requirements on the East Falls campus in preparation for admission to professional programs on the Center City campus. Combined Degree program A Combined Degree program is reserved for fields in which the master's degree is the required credential for a professional license. Students are admitted as freshmen to a Combined Degree program (BS/MS). This pathway may shorten the time to the graduate degree. Undergraduate students must maintain the program's academic progression criteria to remain in the Combined Degree program and to retain admission to the graduate program. \"4 +\" Option \"sub -matriculation\" A \"4+\" Option is an accelerated pathway to a graduate degree. Undergraduate students may apply to a designated graduate program and begin graduate coursework, i.e., submatriculate into the graduate program. The graduate degree is completed after the baccalaureate, in additional semesters depending up on the graduate curriculum. 15 Dual Degree program A Dual Degree program is designed to offer an accelerated pathway to the two degrees at the same level. The two degrees may be completed concurrently or consecutively. 1+1 Option (GRAD+GRAD) This is an efficient option, which may reduce the credits that would have been required to pursue both degrees separately. Disability Services Thomas Jefferson University does not discriminate on the basis of disability, in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. The University provides accommodations for students with disabilities, who are eligible for accommodations and who seek accommodations. All students interested in receiving accommodations must contact the Office of Disability Services by email at AccessibilityServices@philau.edu , phone at (215.951.6830) or by visiting our office (Kanbar 102D). Students request ing accommodations in the classroom must present a current accommodation letter from the Office of Accessibilty Services to the instructor before accommodations may be provided. Thomas Jefferson University works with students with disabilities regarding eq ual access to all services and programs. Requests for accommodations may be made at any time (although accommodations are not retroactive). The University encourages all students who have any inquiries to contact Accessibilty Services. Dropping Courses, Adding Courses, and Schedule Changes Schedule changes, such as adding a course, changing a section, replacing a course or section, etc., must be made by the \"last day to add\" in the Academic Calendar. See Academic Calendar online. Students may drop a course with no notation on the transcript if the drop is completed before \"last day to drop without 'W' grade\" deadline on the Academic Calendar. After the \"last day to drop without W grade,\" a student may withdraw from a course prior to or on the \"last d ay to withdraw from a course\" (see Academic Calendar). When a student withdraws from a course, a \"W\" will appear on the transcript for that course and this will affect the student's Academic Standing. To withdraw from a course, all students must submit a signed Course Withdrawal form to the University Registrar. Forms may be found online at the Registrar's website: http://www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar. If the student officially withdraws after the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" a \"WF\" will appear in the transcript and affect the GPA calculations and Academic Standing. If the student fails to officially withdraw from a course before the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" a 16 grade of \"F\" will appear on his/her transcript and affect the student's GPA calculations and Academic Standing. Specific deadlines for dropping special accelerated courses or summer session courses are published by the Campus Re gistrar. These deadlines will determine the drop period for summer terms. In exceptional cases a student may request special permission from the Director of the Academic Success Center to drop a course after the \"last day to withdraw from a course\" deadli ne. In such cases a grade of \"W\" will appear on the transcript for that course and this will affect Academic Standing. Students may not drop or withdraw from fundamentals courses. Final Examinations Final examinations are scheduled during a one -week period at the end of each semester. Examination periods are two hours in length. The University has a policy prohibiting the administration of any final examinations during the last \"instructional\" week of the semester in place of an examination during th e scheduled final exam week. No student is required to take more than three final examinations during a given day. If, because of this policy, it is necessary for a student to have any examinations rescheduled, arrangements must be made with the University Registrar no later than a week in advance of the start of exam week. Grade Changes All grades become part of the permanent records of the University at the end of the semester. Following this, no grades may be changed without the written approval of t he faculty and associate dean of the college offering the course. Forms for change of grades may be found online on the University Registrar's website, www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar. This in no way affects the institutional policy regarding the grade of \"Incomplete.\" Grade Reports Current students can access and print their grade reports using BannerWeb. Grade reports are not mailed to students. 17 Graduate Status Thomas Jefferson University - East Falls defines graduate credit hours in the following way: 6 & > Credits is equal to full-time 3 to 5.999 credits is equal to half- time, and 0.5 to 2.999 is equal to less than half- time. See also financial aid guidelines. Independent Study (IS) Students may earn credit through a supervised learning experience in which the student plays a significant part in determining the learning objectives and anticipated outcomes. IS provides students a unique opportunity to work closely with a faculty mentor while studying a subject of their own choice. This learning experience, however, should not duplicate material delivered within an existing course catalog. Only students who are prepared to devote considerable time and effort should undertake IS. Planning of the scope and structure of this learning experience should begin in the semester preceding enrollment, not during the term of the IS. Before registering for the IS, students must secure the written approval of a faculty member who has agreed to supervise the work. Approval of IS can be expected if the faculty member has the time and the interest to supervise the student's work, and if the supervisor and the student can agree in advance on a suitab le subject for independent study. Faculty members may choose which applicants they wish to supervise. The decision will be determined by the faculty member's time available, professional interests and his/her estimate of an applicant's prospects for doing suitable work. The student plans specific activities and goals with the help of the cooperating faculty member. The student must then receive approval for the plans and complete the Independent Study agreement form, which is available online at the Regist rar's website, www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar. The student is responsible for bringing the completed and signed form to the Campus Registrar for official enrollment purposes. Internati onal Students International students should consult with the director of International Student Programs concerning specific policies applicable to them. The director of International Student Programs offers assistance to these students in many areas, such as providing orientation assistance, academic advising assistance, referral to language classes as a result of placement testing, and administrative liaison with governmental agencies. 18 All international students, including t ransfer students, must report to the International Student Programs office, located in the Kanbar Student Center, to certify their registration and to provide a local address. The office is open on a walk -in basis and by appointment. For additional information, see www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/internationalservices . Leave of Absence Policy A leave of absence is a leave from the University with the intention of returning within two full academic semesters or a calendar year to complete coursework. The deadline to take a leave of absence from the University without any record of courses or grades of the current semester is the same as the \"last day to drop wit hout a W grade.\" (See Academic Calendar.) If a student takes a leave of absence from the University before the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" all LOA grades will be a \"W\" and will affect the student's Academic Standing. If a student takes a leave o f absence after the \"last day to withdraw from a course\" all LOA grades will be a \"WF\" and will affect the student's GPA calculations and Academic Standing. When a student takes a leave of absence during a semester, the effective date of the leave of abse nce will be determined when the Office of the University Registrar receives the completed leave of absence form (see University Registrar's website for appropriate form). Students must check with the Student Accounts Office to determine their financial responsibility for tuition and other fees, such as housing and meal plans. Any student who is in good academic standing is eligible to take a leave of absence from the University for up to one calendar year. A leave of absence allows students to re -enter the University within one calendar year from the date on which the leave was approved without the need for completing a new application. The leave of absence also enables the student to retain degree requirements from the catalog under which they originally matriculated. Any student may, however, choose to re -enter under requirements in the current catalog. A student whose leave of absence extends beyond two full academic semesters must complete a new application to re -enter the University. Graduation require ments will be determined from the catalog in effect on the date of acceptance for re -entry by the Office of Admissions.. Students who are not in good academic standing are permitted to apply for withdrawal, but not leave of absence. Under these circumstan ces, the Student Experience sub -committee must approve any application for re -entry before a student registers for any additional courses at the University. (See \"Withdrawal from University.\") For information about the financial aspects of the leave of ab sence policy, please refer to the \"Refund Policy\" included in the \"Financial Information\" section of the catalog. 19 Matriculation Maintenance In order to earn credit for the completion of the dissertation, thesis, capstone pr oject or clinical experience, a student must be registered in the appropriate graduate program (either in residence or absentia) during the semester in which the course work is completed or the dissertation or theses are defended, and must be enrolled in the appropriate course. If a student is capable of defending or presenting his/her work within the grace period (approximately four weeks into the next semester, including summer sessions*), the grade of \"Incomplete\" will be awarded. Following successful c ompletion and submission of coursework (or in the case of thesis or dissertation, a final version of the thesis or dissertation), a change of grade will be submitted by the faculty of record. Students who fail to complete the requirements during the grace period must re -register for dissertation, thesis, capstone project or clinical experience until they successfully meet all requirements. Students who are judged by the faculty, dissertation or thesis chair, or advisor to be incapable of completing the requirements during the grace period will receive the grade of \"TH\" (which indicates the course requirements have not been satisfactorily completed, but work is progressing). In addition to being enrolled in the appropriate program, students must re -regis ter in the original course for dissertation, thesis, capstone project or clinical experience coursework in the subsequent fall or spring semester immediately following the semester in which they enrolled to maintain continuous enrollment and to remain in g ood standing**. Tuition equal to one graduate credit will be assessed for subsequent courses in dissertation, thesis, capstone project and clinical experience. When the dissertation, thesis, capstone project or clinical experience is successfully complete d, the faculty, program director or advisor will submit a final grade for course completion and the student will earn one to nine graduate credits (depending on the major field) for the semester during which the dissertation, thesis, capstone project or cl inical experience was successfully completed. * The grace period ends on the date corresponding to when current semester \"I\" or incomplete grades are changed to \"F\" or failing in the subsequent semester; these are listed on the Academic Calendar which is available on the university website. ** These courses will have an identical course number with an \"e\" indicating a matriculation extension. Non -Degree Status Enrollment Students may apply for non -degree status and register for courses at Philadelphia University. Students with non -degree status are permitted to register for a total of 15 earned credits and 20 thereafter must apply for matriculating status. Credits earned under non -degree status cannot be used to receive a certificate, minor, specialization/concentration or any degree without matriculating. Contact the University Registrar's office for more information o n applying and registering as a non-degree student. Credits earned under non -degree status cannot be used to receive a certificate, minor, specialization/concentration, or any degree without matriculating. Registration: Students are expected to register on the published dates for registration. Fees are payable in advance or upon the registration date. Students will receive grades for all courses for which they are registered. Official Class Roster A student who is not on the official class roster (signaling they are not registered for the course) cannot attend nor participate in the class, regardless is the student is taking the course for credit or auditing. Any student who is not on the class roster has until the listed deadline to add the appropriate academic calendar to register. A student should meet with the advising advocate for their major for directions if anything is preventing registration for the course. Students cannot attend a class while attempting to resolve the issue that is preventing re gistration. Repeating a Course Students who fail a required course must repeat the same course during the next term in which it is offered if the course is the only course that will satisfy the requirement, or if they wish to have the failing grade replaced in GPA on the transcript. (The old grade is not removed.) A student will be permitted to enroll in a course for a second time without conditions, regardless of the grade earned in the course previously. A student who has failed a course twice will be permitted to re- enroll for a course for a third time when the student presents the Campus Registrar with written approval from their advisor. A student who has passed a class twice and wishes to take it a third time for any reason, will need to complet e the \"Repeating a Course\" form and get the appropriate signatures to be allowed to enroll for the course. Appropriate forms for approval are available online on the Campus Registrar's webpage, www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar . 21 When a course is repeated, the original grade will remain on the transcript, but it will be removed from the calculation of the grade point average. The new grade will enter into the calculation of the grade point average, even if it is lower than the grade originally earned. Grades of \"NC\" or \"AUDIT\" will not replace a former grade in a repeated course. A course failed at Thomas Jefferson University may not be repeated at another institution without prior written approval. See the \"Permission to Take Courses at Another Institution\" form on Academic Success website www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/successcenter . The most recent grade earned is also the one applied to graduation requirements, even if it is lower than the original grade. Any successfully completed course can be applied to graduation requirements only once, no matter how many times it may be taken and passed. Retention of Student Work Thomas Jefferson University is committed to providing excellent and innovative educational opportunities to its students. To help maintain quality acade mic offerings and to conform to professional accreditation requirements where relevant, the University and its programs regularly examine the effectiveness of the curricula, teaching, services, and programs the University provides. As Thomas Jefferson Univ ersity sees appropriate, it may retain representative examples or copies of student work from all courses. This might include papers, exams, creative works, or portfolios developed and submitted in courses or to satisfy the requirements for degree programs as well as surveys, focus group information, and reflective exercises. Time Restriction The maximum time for completion of the degree program is seven years from the date of first enrollment (four years for the midwifery master's program and five years for doctorate programs). Students who have not earned the graduate degree during this period will have their academic records reviewed and may be asked to meet additional requirements in order to graduate. Transcripts Process for requesting a transcript can be found on the web at www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar/forms The fee for a transcript is $12 per copy. If express service is needed, there is an additional fee of $25 for domestic ex press mail, and an additional fee of $40 for international express mail. Walk in request for overnight service must be received by 10 a.m. 22 Please note that unofficial copies of the transcript are available to currently enrolled students through their BannerWeb account. Transfer of credits - Graduate Students may transfer a maximum of 30% of the total credits required in the graduate program , provided permission of the graduate program director has been obtained and the student is in compliance with program residency requirements as published by the program. Transfer credit for graduate courses previously taken and awarded a grade no less than a \"B\" from other institutions may be accepted, in all modes of delivery. Courses completed at institutions that are neither regionally accredited nor accredited by agencies listed as accreditors by the United Stated Department of Education may be conside red for Thomas Jefferson University transfer equivalencies. Exceptions to the policy may be made by the program director for students studying abroad in university -approved graduate programs. Please note that if a course was used to satisfy the requirements of a completed degree, the credits cannot be used to satisfy the requirements of another degree. Students wishing to transfer credits should be prepared to submit course outlines and texts used so that proper credit may be given. Students wishing to tran sfer credits of prior graduate work must inform the program director at the point of admission. Students already enrolled in a Thomas Jefferson University graduate degree program must have advanced permission from the respective director in order to enroll in courses with the intent to transfer credit. Transfer to a New Degree Program or Concentration Students who have been admitted to a master's degree program at Thomas Jefferson University and who wish to transfer to another degree program, or to change t heir concentration must file a Change of Graduate Program Request form. The form is found online at the Academic Success webpage www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/successcenter. The student's academic recor d will be reviewed by the director of the proposed new program. Approval or denial of the request will be sent to the student. An additional application fee is not required and, ordinarily, admissions credentials need not be resubmitted. Credits already earned in the original program may apply to the program if, in the opinion of the program director, they are appropriate to the new degree. Verification of Identity for Distance Learning In order to verify that the student registered for Thomas Jefferson University distance education courses or programs actually is the individual participating in and receiving credit for the course or program, one or more of the following methods are used to verify identity: a) An individual secure login and password is assigned to each matriculated and registered student b) Pedagogical and related practices that are effective in verifying student identity (faculty training, questioning students, frequent participation in the course, etc.) 23 Secure Login and Password All campus and remote students are provided with secure login credentials, referred to as a \"campus key\" to all academic systems. Pedagogical and Related Practices For the majority of courses and programs, open source, open referen ce testing as well as project based final grades are the norm for Thomas Jefferson University distance learning courses and programs. However, on -line instructors have a responsibility to identify changes in students' activity in on -line courses. Examples of changes could be a sudden change in academic performance, change in writing style, and odd statements by students in discussions or email. Faculty are advised to provide more than one kind of assessment type and to ask students to share important ideas learned from references. FERPA PROTECTION All methods of verifying student identity in distance learning must protect the privacy of student information. Personally identifiable information collected by the College may be used, at the discretion of the Institution, as the basis for identity verification. For instance, students requesting that their learning management system password be reset may be asked to provide two or more pieces of information for comparison with data on file. RESPONSIBILITIES All users of the University's learning management system are responsible for maintaining the security of usernames, passwords, and any other access credentials assigned. The student ID (username) is not a secure credential and may be displayed at various areas in the learning management system. The password used to enter the system is a sequence of random numbers and letters. Access passwords may not be shared or given to anyone other than the user to whom they were assigned for any reason. Faculty teaching c ourses through distance education methods have the primary responsibility for ensuring that their courses comply with the provisions of this policy. Because technology and personal accountability may not verify identity absolutely or ensure academic integrity completely, faculty are encouraged, when feasible and pedagogically sound, to design courses that employ assignments and evaluations unique to the course and that support academic integrity. TRAINING FOR FACULTY AND STUDENTS The Program Directors and Course Coordinators provide faculty with appropriate training to use pedagogical approaches and technology to promote academic integrity. Additionally, the University provides information about the importance of maintaining academic integrity through a var iety of resources. They are widely disseminated in the Student Handbook, the University Catalog, and on Blackboard. Syllabi, the University Catalog and orientations include information for students on the rigors of maintaining academic integrity. 24 Withdrawal from the University It is absolutely essential that students follow the proper withdrawal procedure in order to be assured of an honorable dismissal from the University. Students are considered in attendance until this formal notification is completed and returned to the University Registrar. The deadline to withdraw from the University without any record of courses or grades of the current semester is the same as the \"last day to drop without a W grade.\" (See Academic Calendar.) If a student withdraws from the University before the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" all withdrawal grades will be a \"W\" and will affect the student's Academic Standing upon return to the University. If a student wi thdraws after the \"last day to withdraw from a course,\" all withdrawal grades will be a \"WF\" and will affect the G.P.A calculations and Academic Standing upon return to the University. If they are withdrawing during the exam period, they will receive \"WF\" grades for all their courses. If an instructor has entered a grade, the grade entered by the instructor will not be changed. Please note that an \"F\" and \"WF\" grade have the same effect on the GPA and Academic Standing. The \"WF\" grade identifies a late wit hdrawal. Students who need to leave the University after the \"last day to withdraw from a course\" due to serious circumstances must seek permission from the Dean of Students for late withdrawal. Students who receive permission will receive \"W\" grades. Withdrawal forms are available online on the University Registrar's webpage http://www.eastfalls.jefferson.edu/registrar. To return to the University after withdrawal, see the section on \"Re -entry to "}
