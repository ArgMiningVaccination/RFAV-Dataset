The PresidentProclamation 5688 of August 4, 1987 W omen's Equality Day, 1987 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Throughout our history, an A m erican saga of optimism, hard work, quiet heroism, and steady expansion, the contributions of women have been indis\u00ad pensable to this N ation's progress. From Plymouth and Jam estow n to the Oregon T rail and the G reat Plains, women of strength and determ ination helped fashion a new life and a new nation from the raw m aterials of the A m erican w ilderness. Their faith in God, their trust in the promise of the New W orld, and their love for their fam ilies steeled them against the rigors of daily living in a harsh and untamed land. W ithout their commitment, A m erica would never have yielded up the bounty that w as the first hallm ark of its greatness. In recognition of these immeasurable contributions and to redress the injustice of denying American women the right to vote, the Nineteenth Amendment was adopted in 1920 to guarantee political equality, the very bedrock of all rights and liberties, to American women. On this August 26, we celebrate the 67th anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment as Women's Equality Day, and we celebrate as well the role that women have won for themselves in our country's democratic process. Political equality has meant a growing panoply of opportunity for women and accelerating economic growth for America. It has reaffirmed the core ideals of the political compacts that built our Nation and sustain it now\u2014the endowment of unalienable rights and unique abilities that each of us possesses from our Creator. It has opened the horizons of achievement and widened the paths of prosperity and personal fulfillment. On this occasion, then, w e must rededicate ourselves to policies and strategies that safeguard equality o f opportunity and that help us secure the goals that equality serves: healthy fam ilies, good neighborhoods, productive work, true peace, and genuine freedom. A m erica today honors wom en for all they have done, as pioneers, patriots, parents, and partners, to build happy homes and a strong society. NOW, THEREFORE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim August 26,1987, as Women's Equality Day. I call upon all Americans to mark this occasion with appropriate observances. IN W ITN ESS W H EREO F, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of August, in the year o f our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of A m erica the two hundred and twelfth.

Those afflicted suffer increasing forgetfulness, confusion, irritability, and other changes in personality and behavior, and som etim es in judgment, concentration, and speech. The tragedy of A lzheim er's d isease has spurred scientists to intensify their efforts to understand w hat cau ses the brain to deteriorate. Recently, a re\u00ad search team cloned a gene involved in the w ayw ard biochem istry of the Alzheim er s brain and located this gene on a specific chrom osom e. This achievem ent opens new lines o f investigation and offers hope that one day we can identify those at risk and develop methods of treatm ent and prevention. Until we conquer A lzheim er's disease, we must continue our research efforts, provide the public with inform ation about the disorder, and seek other w ays to ease its burden on patients, fam ilies, and caregivers. M any people and organizations are already devoted to this effort, including the Federal govern\u00ad m ent's N ational Institute on Aging and N ational Institute o f M ental Health and the private secto r's A lzheim er's D isease and Related D isorders A sso cia\u00ad tion, which conducts and prom otes research and lends support to fam ilies seeking help. The Congress, by Public Law 100-68, has designated the month of November 1987 as N ational A lzheim er's D isease M onth\" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclam ation in observance o f this occasion. NOW , TH EREFO RE, I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of A m erica, do hereby proclaim the month o f N ovem ber 1987 as N ational A lzheim er's D isease M onth, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate cerem onies and activities.

After considering all relevant aspects of the case, including those set forth in section 202(c) of the Trade Act of 1974, I have determined to provide import relief for the domestic industry. Relief should be granted in the form of a negotiated orderly market agreement. I therefore direct you to negotiate and conclude an orderly marketing agree\u00ad ment and to report the results o f such negotiations not later than 50 days from the date o f this determ ination. If such negotiations are not successful, I direct you to prepare and present to me for signature no later than 60 days from the date of this decision a proclam ation imposing quantitative restrictions.

These amendments are necessary to protect against the introduction into the United States of injurious insects. We are also making nonsubstantive editorial changes to the proposed rule. e f f e c t i v e D A TE : September 8,1987. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION C O N TA C T: Frank Cooper, Staff Officer, Regulatory Services Staff, Plant Protection and Quarantine, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 637, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782,301-436-8248. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Fruits and Vegetables regulations in 7 CFR 319.56 e t seq . (referred to below as the regulations) impose restrictions on the importation of fruits and vegetables in order to prevent the introduction and dissemination of injurious insects, including fruit and melon flies, that are new to or not widely distributed within and throughout the United States. The regulations include a provision that fruits and vegetables may be imported under a permit if the Department is satisfied \"that their importation from definite areas ordistricts under approved safeguards prescribed in the permit can be authorized without risk . . . \"(\u00a7319.56- 2(e)(2).) In a document published in the Federal Register on January 8,1987 (52 FR 685-687, Docket No. 86-330), we proposed to amend the regulations by specifying criteria for the importation of fruits and vegetables from definite areas and districts in order to ensure that they are free from injurious insects. Since each definite area or district exists in a country infested by injurious insects, there is an ever-present danger that these insects could spread into the definite area or district. We also proposed to amend the regulations by specifying criteria that would have to be met to authorize the importation of a fruit or vegetable from certain definite areas or districts. We solicited comments on the proposal for 30 days, ending February 9, 1987, and received four comments, two from associations, one from a State agency, and one from a foreign embassy. We have considered the comments carefully and discuss below the issues raised by them. Based on the rational set forth in the proposal and in this document, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal with the changes discussed below as a final rule. We are also making nonsubstantive editorial changes to the proposed rule. Comments Two commenters indicated that one of our proposed criteria for establishing a definite area or district\u2014that there are no reports in the scientific literature of occurrence; in the definite area or district of the country of origin of injurious insects known to attack fruits or vegetables\u2014was a problem because it could exclude areas where such a report was later shown to be in error or where injurious insects were once reported but where they no longer exist or have been eradicated. We recognized that this criterion might cause confusion and possibly result in the unnecessary elimination of an area from the status of definite area or district under the regulations. We intend to allow a definite area or district to be established only after we determine that the area is free from certain injurious insect species. We believe that the best way to determine the presence or absence of particular insect species in an area is to rely on recent surveys of the area that areperformed according to procedures approved by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). Therefore, in response to these comments, we are eliminating the scientific literature criterion but will retain the criterion requiring injurious insect surveys that must be approved by the Deputy Administrator, Plant Protection and Quarantine, APHIS. Two commenters also requested that the regulations make it clear that the procedures concerning surveys and enforcement activities conducted by the countries of origin must be submitted to the Deputy Administrator in writing. We agree, and are therefore requiring the plant protection service of the country of origin to submit to the Deputy Administrator written detailed procedures for the conducting of surveys and the enforcement of requirements to prevent the introduction of injurious insects. Two commenters questioned the advisability of relying on survey and eradication efforts of foreign countries, and requested clarification of the procedures APHIS would use to monitor compliance with the regulations by foreign countries. APHIS will assign employees from its International Programs office to regularly visit participating countries to observe and report on compliance with this regulation by the countries of origin. One commenter stated that it is unclear what the requirements are that will prevent the introduction of injurious insects into definite areas and districts. As criterion (2) in the new paragraph (f) states, these requirements must be at least equivalent to the requirements imposed under Chapter III to prevent the introduction into the United States and interstate spread of injurious insects. Chapter III includes a variety of regulatory requirements, including certificate requirements, inspections, treatments, and prohibition or restriction of movement of plant pests and regulated articles that may spread plant pests. It will be necessary for the country of origin to impose those requirements on a definite area or district which are necessary in the opinion of the Deputy Administrator to exclude injurious insects as effectively as they would be excluded in a United States area subject to the regulations in Chapter III. 29370 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, and we have determined that it is not a \"major rule.\" Based on information compiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will have an effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will not cause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign- based enterprises in domestic or export markets. The primary effect of adoption of this rule will be to establish criteria that the Department will use in making decisions about when to allow importations of fruits and vegetables from definite areas or districts of foreign countries under the provisions of \u00a7 319.56-2(e). We do not expect that the rule will have a major effect on the amount or types of fruit imported into the United States, or that there will be any adverse economic effects on small domestic growers and importers. The total annual increase in the amount of fruits and vegetables imported as a result of this rule will be insignificant compared with the total amount of fruits and vegetables imported annually. We do not expect this rule to increase the costs of affected articles or to impose other economic hardships on any entities involved in importing fruits and vegetables under its provisions. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Paperwork Reduction Act Information collection requirements included in this final rule have been approved by the -Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 e t seq .) and have been assigned control number 0579- 0049.

SUMMARY: Regulation 573 establishes the quantity of fresh Califomia-Arizona lemons that may be shipped to market at 351,393 cartons during the period August 9 through August 15,1987. Such action is needed to balance the supply of fresh lemons with market demand for the period specified, due to the marketing situation confronting the lemon industry. D ATES: Regulation 573 (\u00a7 910.873) is effective for the period August 9 through August 15,1987. FOR FURTHER INFORM ATION C O N TA C T: James M. Scanlon, Acting Chief, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, Washington, DC 20250-0200, telephone: (202) 447-5697. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORM ATION: This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation 1512-1 and has been determined to be a \"non-major\" rule under criteria contained therein. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory action to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued .pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.This regulation is issued under Marketing Order No. 910, as amended 7 CFR Part 910) regulating the handling of lemons grown in California and Arizona. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674). This action is based upon the recommendation and information submitted by the Lemon Administrative Committee and upon other available information. It is found that this action will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. This regulation is consistent with the marketing policy for 1987-88. The committee met publicly on August 4,1987, in Los Angeles, California, to consider the current and prospective conditions of supply and demand and unanimously recommended a quantity of lemons deemed advisable to be handled during the specified week. The committee reports that the market is good. It is further found that it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice, engage in public rulemaking, and postpone the effective date until 30 days after publication in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 553), because of insufficient time between the date when information became available upon which this regulation is based and the effective date necessary to effectuate the declared purposes of the Act. Interested persons were given an opportunity to submit information and views on the regulation at an open meeting. It is necessary to effectuate the declared purposes of the Act to make these regulatory provisions effective as specified, and handlers have been apprised of such provisions and the effective time.

SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 767 airplanes, which requires replacement of an existing 50-ampere circuit breaker with a 35-ampere circuit breaker. This 35-ampere circuit breaker provides current overload protection for the auxiliary power unit (APU) starter transformer rectifier unit (TRU). This amendment is prompted by reports of smoke filling the aft cargo compartment on Model 757 airplanes (which have a design similar to Model 767 airplanes) and open flame at the TRU, resulting from failure of the existing 50-ampere circuit breaker to open when the APU starter motor had seized. EFFECTIVE D A TE : September 13,1987. ADDRESSES: The applicable service information may be obtained from the Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, P.O. Bax 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124. This information may be examined at the FA A Northwest Mountain Region, 17900 Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington, or the Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 9010 East Marginal Way South, Seattle, Washington.

Mailing address: FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C - 68966, Seattle, Washington 98168. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive which requires replacement of the APU starter TRU circuit breaker on Boeing Model 767 series airplanes, was published in the 29372 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations Federal Register on May 6,1987 (52 FR 16851). Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the single comment received. The commenter had no objection to the proposed rule because no U.S. registered airplanes were affected. The commenter stated that the FAA should only issue the AD if any unmodified airplanes are determined to exist. The FAA does not agree. Twenty-six airplanes equipped with 50 ampere circuit breakers were delivered to eight foreign operators. In accordance with existing provisions of the bilateral airworthiness agreements, the FAA must issue the AD to advise the foreign regulatory agencies that an unsafe condition may exist or develop on airplanes. Furthermore, the AD is needed to ensure that, if any of the twenty-six foreign-registered airplanes equipped with 50 ampere circuit breakers are later imported into the United States, the circuit breaker will have been replaced. After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule, as proposed. No Model 767 airplanes of U.S. registry are affected by this AD, since U.S. operators have elected a different system configuration option. However, it is estimated that it will take approximately 2 manhours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor charge will be $40 per manhour. The cost of one 35-ampere circuit breaker per airplane is estimated to be $145 per unit. For these reasons, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significant under Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because few, if any, Boeing Model 767 airplanes are operated by small entities. A final evaluation has been prepared for this regulation and has been placed in the docket. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Aviation safety, Aircraft. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administrationamends \u00a7 39.13 of Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows: PART 39\u2014 [AMENDED] 1.

Compliance is required as indicated unless previously accomplished. To minimize the fire hazard associated with overheating of the transformer rectifier unit (TRU) of the auxiliary power unit (APU) starter motor, accomplish the following within 3 months after the effective date of this AD: A. Replace the 56-ampere circuit breaker used for the APU starter TRU with a 35- ampere circuit breaker in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 767-24A0039, dated March 12,1987, or later FAA-approved revision. B. An alternate means of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time, which provides an acceptable level of safety, may be used when approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, FAA, Northwest Mountain Region.

ACTIO N : Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would require inspection and replacement, as necessary, of main landing gear retainer assemblies on certain McDonnell Douglas DC-9-80 (MD-80) series airplanes. This AD is prompted by a report of a main landing gear (MLG) wheel separating from the aircraft during landing. This AD is needed to minimize the possibility of a wheel assembly separation during wheel rotation. e f f e c t i v e D A TE : September 13,1987. ADDRESSES: The applicable service information may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, 3855 Lakewood Boulevard, Long Beach, California 90846, Attention: Director, Publications and Training, C1-L65 (54\u2014 60). This information may be examined at the FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, 17900 Pacific Highway South, Seattle, Washington, or 4344 Donald Douglas Drive, Long Beach, California.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include a new airworthiness directive (AD) which requires modification of certain main landing gear retainer assemblies on McDonnell Douglas DC-9-80 (MD-80) series airplanes was published as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) in the Federal Register on May 8,1986 (51 FR 17054), and as an amended NPRM on February 19,1987 (52 FR 5141). Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to all comments received. One commenter requested to be exempt from the proposed rule if the subject retainer assemblies are modified so that the lockpin is secured to the retainer with a lockpin. The FAA notes Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations 29373 that provisions for applying for an alternate means of compliance are included in paragraph B. of the rule. One commenter objected to the proposed six-month compliance time because of the lack of availability of parts from the manufacturer; however, the commenter did not propose an alternate compliance time. The FAA does not agree that the availability of parts within the proposed compliance time will be a problem to operators. The manufacturer has notified FAA that replacement parts are available when requested in accordance with the Service Bulletin instructions. Therefore, the FAA has determined that the proposed compliance time is appropriate. In addition, paragraph A. of the final rule has been revised to clarify the requirement that any main landing gear axle nut retainer assembly found to be improperly installed must be replaced prior to further flight After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the changes previously mentioned. It is estimated that 146 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 4 manhours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor cost will be $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $23,360. For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulation is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 F R 11034; February 26, 1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities because few, if any, Model DC-9-80 (MD-80) series airplanes are operated by small entities.

The regulation clearly states that eligibility for G-COM is based solely on the technical performance characteristics of the commodity. Nevertheless, some exporters have been uncertain about the application of G - COM to computer peripherals that are not included as part of complete computer systems. Their concern is based on entry 1565A or the CCL, Advisory Note 9(a)(3), which states that computera must be exported as complete systems. This rule clarifies that this is an end-use restriction, not a technical characteristic, and does not prevent individual or bulk exports of peripheral devices under General License G-COM provided the technical parameters are such that the peripheral device would be eligible for export under Advisory Note 9 to ECCN1565A.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORM ATION: Rulemaking Requirements 1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function of the United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the m\u00e9aning of section 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirements of that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysis has to be or will be prepared. 2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section 553 29374 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), including those requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunity for public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule also is exempt from these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and military affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Accordingly, it is being issued in.final form. However, as with other Department of Commerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome. Comments should be submitted to Vincent Greenwald, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Export Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044. 3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, under sections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared. 4.

This action is consistent with a final rule published by the Immigration and Naturalization Service on December 9,1986, at 51 FR 44266, and reflects the Department of State's concurrence in the policy set forth in the Service's final rule. This rule affects a small number of aliens who seek to enter the United States temporarily to perform building and construction work. EFFECTIVE D A TE: August 7,1987. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION C O N TA C T: Rudolph Henderson, Legal Adviser's Office, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, (202) 647-^415. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORM ATION: On December 9,1986, the Immigration and Naturalization Service published a final rule barring classification and admission as temporary visitors for business of aliens seeking to enter the United States to perform building or construction work. The background of the Service's rule is explained in the Supplementary Information published therewith. The Department has a responsibility to coordinate with the Immigration and Naturalization Service issues involving certain visa-issuance practices. In this instance, the Department believes visa issuing procedures under \u00a7 41.25(b) require such coordination. Accordingly, on April 14,1987, the Department published a proposed amendment to \u00a7 41.25(b), which would conform its policies regarding visa issuance to temporary business visitors with the Service's regulations. (51 FR 12001.) The Supplementary Information in the April 14 notice of proposed rulemaking stated that the Service had confirmed to the Department that its December 9, 1986 amendment to 8 CFR 214.2(b) precludes B -l nonimmigrant status to any alien seeking to enter the United States to perform building or construction work, whether on-site or in- plant, subject only to an exception for supervision and training as described in the amendment. The Service has confirmed that it does not read the December 9 amendment to allow an additional exception for building or construction work incident to after-sale installation and service or other warranty work after installation. It does not appear that further clarification of that point is needed. Comments Received Interested persons were given an opportunity to participate in the proposed rule. Consideration has been given to the two comments received and an analysis follows below. One commenter asked whether the proposed rule will affect aliens coming into this country to perform work on equipment or machinery. The answer is that the regulation may affect such Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and R\u00e9gulations 29375 aliens if their work constitutes nonsupervisory building or construction work, as described in the regulation. It is not possible to give an advance ruling on what constitutes \"building or construction work,\" since that will depend on the facts of the individual case. The second commenter expressed some concern that the proposed rule would remove otherwise applicable restrictions on the issuance of B -l visas to aliens seeking to enter the country to perform supervision or training of others engaged in building or construction work. This was not the intent of the proposal, and the language has been changed to make it clear that persons performing supervision or training of others engaged in building or construction work must be otherwise qualified as B -l nonimmigrants in order to obtain B -l visas. With this change, it is clear that the State Department and the INS standards are identical with regard to the non-availability of B -l visas for aliens seeking to enter the country to perform building or construction work. In view of the fact that the Service's regulations have been in effect since the date of publication of its final rule, December 9,1986, this rule will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register.

ACTIO N : Temporary regulations. s u m m a r y : This document contains temporary regulations under section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, relating to accounting for costs incurred in the production of property. In addition, the text of the temporary regulations set forth in this document also serves as the text of the proposed regulations cross-referenced in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in the proposed rules section of this issue of the Federal Register. Changes to the applicable tax law were made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986. d a t e s : In general, the amendments are effective for costs incurred after December 31,1986 or, in the case of inventories, for taxable years beginning after December 31,1986. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION C O N TA C T: Paulette C. Galanko of the Legislation and Regulations Division, Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service, 1111 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20224 (Attention: CC:LR:T), (202) 566-3288, not a toll-free call. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On March 30,1987, proposed and temporary regulations interpreting section 263A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 were published in the Federal Register (Treasury Decision 8131). This document contains additional amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) under section 263A of the Code. These amendments conform the regulations to the requirements of section 803 of theTax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514), 100 Stat. 2085 (the \"Act\"). The temporary regulations contained in this document will remain in effect until additional temporary or final regulations are published in the Federal Register. Practical Capacity Under prior law, \u00a7 1.471-11 (d)(4) of the full absorption regulations permitted manufacturers of inventory to use the \"practical capacity concept\" in determining the amounts of fixed indirect production costs which were subject to inclusion in ending inventory. Under the practical capacity concept, taxpayers were required to apportion only a percentage of their fixed indirect production costs to units of production; this percentage corresponded to the percentage of productive capacity at which the particular manufacturing facility was operating. The remaining amounts of fixed indirect production costs were then currently deducted by the taxpayer. The temporary regulations prohibit the use of the practical capacity concept in accounting for costs under section 263A. The legislative history to section 263A clearly provides that the new uniform capitalization rules are to be patterned after the rules contained in \u00a7 1.451-3 of the Income Tax Regulations applicable to \"extended period long\u00ad term contracts.\" S. Rep. No. 99-313,99th Cong., 2d Sess. 141-42 (1986). It is the position of the Internal Revenue Service that the rules of \u00a7 1.451-3 do not permit the use of the practical capacity concept. The capitalization rules applicable to extended period long-term contracts contain no provision allowing the use of the practical capacity concept, an exception to the general rules of \"full absorption\" accounting that apply to the determination of inventoriable costs. The practical capacity concept conflicts with the principles of the extended period long-term contract regulations which, in order to properly match income and expense, require capitalization of all indirect costs that \"directly benefit the performance of extended period long-term contracts, or are incurred by reason of the performance of extended period long\u00ad term contracts.\" section 1.451-3(d)(6)(ii). The use of the practical capacity concept would undermine and conflict with the careful delineation in the extended period long-term contract regulations of certain indirect costs which may be currently expensed and not allocated to production activities [e.g., certain costs of equipment and facilities which are temporarily idle). 29376 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations Moreover, the fact that the temporary regulations retain certain cost allocation methods available to manufacturers under prior law [eg ., the manufacturing burden rate method, and the standard cost method) does not support the ratification of the practical capacity concept under section 263A. The cost allocation methods retained in the regulations are used to apportion inventoriable costs among different units of production; in contrast, the practical capacity concept identifies which costs are subject to capitalization. Thus, the practical capacity concept effectively functions as a capitalization rule which allows a specified percentage of otherwise inventoriable costs to be currently expensed, with the remaining inventoriable costs to be separately apportioned to units of production under whatever separate cost allocation methods are used by the taxpayer. The repeal of the practical capacity concept applies under the effective date provisions of section 803(d) of the Act, including section 803(d)(2) which requires a change in method of accounting for inventory taxpayers and a corresponding section 481(a) adjustment. The section 481(a) adjustment is determined by assuming that the capitalization rules of section 263A (including the repeal of the practical capacity concept) applied for all relevant prior years of the taxpayer. Change in Method of Accounting and Deferred Intercompany Transactions Section 1.1502-13 of the regulations provides rules with respect to affiliated groups of corporations filing consolidated Federal income tax returns. Under those regulations, gain or loss with respect to certain intercompany transactions may be deferred by members of the affiliated group until such time as certain subsequent events occur. For example, a member of an affiliated group may sell inventory property to another member of the group, and the selling taxpayer may defer recognition of the gain from such sale until the property is sold to a person outside the affiliated group. Moreover, in determining the amount of gain which is deferred by the selling taxpayer in such a situation, the rules of section 263A shall apply in determining the cost of the sold property. See \u00a7 1.1502-13(c)(2) as amended by Treasury Decision 8131, published in the Federal Register on March 30,1987. Under section 263A, taxpayers are required to change their methods of accounting with respect to inventory property \u00bfeffective for taxable years beginning after December 31,1988. The regulations clarify that taxpayers withoutstanding balances of deferred intercompany gain or loss as of the beginning of the year of change in method of accounting must revalue the amount of the deferred intercompany gain or loss if such gain or loss pertains to the sale or exchange of inventory property. The deferred intercompany gain or loss must be revalued to an amount equal to the deferred gain or loss which would have resulted had the cost of goods sold for that inventory property been determined under the capitalization rules of section 263A. Thus, for example, assume that corporation A, a member of an affiliated group filing a consolidated Federal income tax return on a calendar year, manufactures and sells inventory property to corporation B, a member of the same affiliated group, in 1985. As of January 1,1987, the inventory property is Still held by corporation B, based on the particular inventory identification method used by B for Federal income tax purposes, e.g., the last-in, first-out method (\"LIFO\") or the first-in, first-out method (\"FIFO\"). The property was sold by A to B in 1985 for $150; the cost of goods sold with respect to the property under the law in effect at the time the inventory was produced (see \u00a7 1.471-3) was $100, resulting in a gain of $50 which A deferred under \u00a7 1.1502-13(c). The deferred intercompany gain of $50 is still outstanding on A's books and records as of January 1,1987. The regulations require A to revalue the amount of the deferred gain, assuming that the rules of section 263A had applied to A's production of the inventory in 1985 and thus had determined the cost of the property. Assume that the cost of the inventory under the capitalization rules of section 263A would have been $110, had the rules applied to A's manufacturing activities in 1985. Under the regulations, A is required to revalue the amount of the deferred gain to $40; moreover, since the revaluation of the deferred gain would result in the omission of $10 of such gain, A is required to increase its section 481(a) adjustment by $10. The regulations require the revaluation of the deferred gain or loss resulting from sales of inventory property for both inventory property which was produced by the selling taxpayer, and inventory property which was acquired for resale by the selling taxpayer. The regulations provide that, in revaluing the amount of the deferred gain, all of the provisions applicable to the revaluation of inventory property accompanying the taxpayer's change in method of accounting under section263A shall apply, including, for example, the use of simplified methods and other procedures available to inventory taxpayers under the regulations. The regulations require the revaluation of the deferred gain or loss from intercompany sales in order to prevent such sales from substantially altering the results which would otherwise occur from the change in method of accounting under section 263A. (See section 263A(h)(l) of the Code). Without such a revaluation of deferred gain or loss, an affiliated group making intercompany sales of inventory property would experience significantly different results under section 263A than inventory taxpayers not making such sales. Such results could be favorable, or unfavorable to the affiliated group, depending on the particular methods of accounting used by members of the group. Moreover, any such differences in result would be inappropriate, in light of the fact that the affiliated sales are not given full, immediate effect for Federal income tax purposes and may, in certain situations, lack economic significance. Thus, based on the foregoing, the regulations require the revaluation of deferred gain or loss from inventory sales under section 263A in order that the transitional rules of section 263A may be applied in an equitable and uniform manner. The requirement to revalue the amount of deferred intercompany gain or loss applies only for purposes of determining the section 481(a) adjustment that results from die application of the rules of section 263A. The Service, however, is considering the issue of whether to require a similar restatement of deferred intercompany gain or loss in other situations where a change in method of accounting generates a section 481(a) adjustment within a consolidated group. Availability of Certain Inventory Methods for Property Produced in Farming Businesses Under die existing regulations, the costs required to be allocated to any plant or animal produced in the trade or business of farming may be determined using reasonable inventory methods such as the farm-price method or the unit-livestock-price method. See \u00a7\u00a71.263A-lT(c)(5)(i) and 1.471-6. The regulations clarify that, for purposes of section 263A, taxpayers may use the farm-price method or the unit-livestock- price method to determine the costs allocated to any plant or animal produced in the trade or business of fanning, regardless of whether such plant or animal is held as inventory by Federal Register / Vol, 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations 29377 the taxpayer. Thus, for example, taxpayers may use the unit-livestock- price method to account for the costs of raising livestock which will be used in the trade or business of farming (e.g., a breeding animal or a dairy cow), although the animal in question will not be held or treated as inventory property by the taxpayer. In addition, the regulations contain a clarifying example with respect to the definition of farming under section 263A. Capitalization of Taxes Section 1.263A-lT(b)(2)(iii)(I) of the existing regulations generally requires the capitalization of taxes otherwise allowable as a deduction under section 164 (other than income taxes) that relate to labor, materials, supplies, equipment, land or facilities. The regulations modify the reference to section 164 in acknowledgement of the fact that taxes relating to labor, materials, supplies, equipment, land or facilities may be deducted under sections of the Code other than section 164 [e.g., section 162). Thus, under section 263A, taxes relating to the previously enumerated factors are required to be capitalized irrespective of the particular Code section which would otherwise allow the deduction of such taxes. Use of Simplified Methods Under the existing regulations, taxpayers producing certain types of property may elect the use of the simplified production method and the simplified service cost method to account for the costs required to be capitalized under section 263A. Similarly, taxpayers acquiring property for resale may elect the use of the simplified resale method to account for their section 263A costs. It is intended that inventory taxpayers electing the use of a particular simplified method shall use such method for purposes of both (i) restating their beginning inventory balances under the change in method of accounting required by section 263A, and (ii) accounting for their inventory costs under section 263A on an ongoing, prospective basis. Taxpayers may not, for example, use a simplified method to restate their beginning inventory balances, and another method to account for their section 263A costs incurred after the effective date of section 263A unless such taxpayers obtain the consent of the Commissioner to change their methods of accounting. Although the Internal Revenue Service believes that the regulations already required the use of the simplified methods in the foregoing manner, the regulations have been amended in order to make this requirement more clear.Acceleration of Section 481(a) Adjustment Section 1.263A\u2014 lT(e)(3)(iii) of the existing regulations provides that, in certain circumstances, a taxpayer is required to take its section 481(a) adjustment into account over the number of tax years (not to exceed 4) that the taxpayer has used its present method of accounting. The regulations clarify that, for purposes of this particular provision only, the section 481(a) adjustment is to be taken into account ratably over the number of tax years (not to exceed 4) that the taxpayer has engaged in the particular trade or business to which the adjustment applies. Thus, the period over which the section 481(a) adjustment is to be taken into account is not limited to the number of years that the taxpayer has used a particular method of accounting in such trade or business. For example, a taxpayer engaged in the business of producing property for 5 years prior to its taxable year beginning after December 31,1986 shall, if otherwise allowed under the regulations, take into account the section 481(a) adjustment over a period of 4 years, although such taxpayer changed its method of accounting for the property produced in the particular trade or business within the four year period preceding the year of change under section 263A. On-Site Storage Under the present regulations, costs associated with an \"ort-site storage facility\" are not required to be capitalized with respect to inventory property. The present regulations provide that an on-site storage facility is a facility which is physically attached to, and an integral part of, a retail sales facility where the taxpayer sells merchandise stored at the facility to retail customers physically present at the facility. The present regulations provide that a storage or warehousing area operated by a person making sales of goods \"wholesale\" to persons physically present at the facility who in turn resell the goods to others, is not an on-site storage facility because such sales are not made to retail customers. The regulations clarify that, for purposes of this provision, the term \"retail sales\" means sales to a \"retail customer\", i.e., the final purchaser or consumer of the merchandise sold. Thus, the term \"retail sales\" does not mean sales of goods to an intermediary who resells the goods to others, including a contractor or manufacturer who incorporates the goods into another product which is then sold to customers.Distribution Costs The present regulations provide that \"distribution costs\" are not subject to capitalization under section 263A. Distribution costs are defined as \"the costs of delivering goods directly to the customer, e.g., costs incurred in delivering an item from a storage facility to a customer's home.\" Section 1.263A- lT(d)(3)(ii)(C)(5). It is intended that distribution costs include costs incurred in delivering goods directly to an unrelated customer's facility although that customer resells such goods to other persons. The regulations clarify the definition of distribution costs in this regard. Distribution costs do not, however, include internal transportation or delivery costs, such as costs incurred by a taxpayer in moving inventory from the taxpayer's warehouse to its retail store. Change in Method of Accounting The present regulations generally require that taxpayers change their method of accounting in order to conform to the capitalization requirements of section 263A. Section 1.263A -lT(e)(ll) of the regulations provides that such change in method of accounting shall be automatic if such change in method of accounting is required under that section, i.e., if such change is necessary in order for the taxpayer to properly capitalize and allocate costs with respect to production and resale activities in the manner prescribed in the regulations. The regulations clarify that an automatic change in method of accounting under section 263A includes: (i) A change in method of accounting whereunder a taxpayer properly expenses certain costs under section 263A which were previously capitalized by the taxpayer under the taxpayer's prior method of accounting: and (ii) A change in method of accounting whereunder a taxpayer properly capitalizes certain costs under section 263A which were previously expensed by the taxpayer under the taxpayer's prior method of accounting, regardless of whether such prior methods of accounting were correct or erroneous methods under the law in effect at that time. The regulations also provide guidance regarding the interaction of the change in method of accounting under section 263A with respect to inventory property, and any other changes in method of accounting which the taxpayer may make for its first taxable year beginning after December 31,1986. The regulations provide that the taxpayer is deemed to make any change in method of accounting required under section 263A 23378 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations (and the accompanying section 481(a) adjustment) before making any other changes in methods of accounting for the same taxable year. Thus, for example, assume a calendar year taxpayer that produces inventory property is required to change its method of accounting under section 263A for its taxable year beginning January 1,1987. That taxpayer also desires to change from the LIFO to the FIFO method for the same taxable year, and complies with all necessary procedures to effectuate such change, including obtaining the consent of the Commissioner to such change in method of accounting (if required under such procedures). The change in method of accounting required by section 263A shall be deemed to occur first, and such change in method of accounting (including the calculation of the section 481(a) adjustment) shall be based on the taxpayer's inventory records existing as of January 1,1987, under the LIFO method used by the taxpayer. After the change in method of accounting under section 263A is deemed to be made and the amount of the resulting section 481(a) adjustment is determined, the change in method of accounting from LIFO to FIFO is then deemed to occur. Tangible Personal Property The existing regulations provide that section 263A applies to the production of tangible personal property, including the production of property such as films, sound recordings, video tapes, books and other similar property. In the case of a book, the costs of production include the costs incurred in developing, researching, and writing the book (including costs incurred by authors engaged in these activities) as well as the costs incurred in connection with the book's publication. The regulations have been amended in order to make this requirement more clear. Special Analyses The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this temporary rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291. Accordingly, a Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required. A general notice of proposed rulemaking is not required for temporary regulations. Accordingly, the temporary regulations are not subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Paulette C. Galanko of the Legislation and Regulations Division, Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. However, personnelfrom other offices of the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated in developing the regulation with respect to matters of both substance and style.

Amendments to the Regulations For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Subchapter A, Part 1, Chapter I of the Code of Federal Regulations are amended as set forth below: PART 1\u2014 [AMENDED] Paragraph 1. The authority for Part 1 continues to read as follows: Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805. * * * Section 1.263A-1T also issued under 26 U.S.C. 263A. Par. 2. Section 1.263A-1T is amended as follows: 1. Paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(A) is revised; 2. Paragraph (b) is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(2)(iii)(I) and by adding paragraphs (b)(2)(vii), (b)(5)(vii) and (b)(6)(vi); 3. Paragraph (c) is amended by revising paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) and by adding paragraph (c)(5)(iii). 4.

For purposes of this section, the term \"tangible personal property\" includes films, sound recordings, video tapes, books and other similar property containing words, ideas, concepts, images or sounds. A sound recording is a work that results from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds, regardless of the nature of the material objects, such as discs, tapes or other phonorecordings, in which such sounds are embodied. This section applies to the production of tangible personal property within the meaning of this paragraph (a)(5)(iii) without regard to whether such property is treated as tangible or intangible underother sections of the Code. Thus, the requirements of this section apply to the costs of the properties enumerated in this paragraph (a)(5)(iii) although such costs may consist of copyrights, licenses, manuscripts, and other items which may be treated as intangible for other purposes of the Code. For example, the costs of producing or developing a book (including teaching aids and other similar property) required to be capitalized under this section include costs incurred by authors in researching, preparing, and writing literary works. In addition, such costs include prepublication expenditures incurred by publishers of books and other similar property, including payments made to authors of literary works, as well as costs incurred by such publishers in the writing, editing, compiling, illustrating, designing and development of books or similar property. Such costs are required to be capitalized under this section without regard to whether such costs are determined to relate to the production of a manuscript or copyright of a book, as opposed to physical costs (e.g., paper and ink) of printing and binding a book. See \u00a7 1.174-2{a){lj, which provides that the term \"research or experimental expenditures\" does not include expenditures incurred for research in connection with literary, historical, or similar projects. * * (b) C apitalization o f costs. * * * (2) Types o f costs. * * * (iii) E xam ples o f in d irect costs. * * * (I) Taxes otherwise allowable as a deduction (other than State, local, and foreign income taxes) that relate to labor, materials, supplies, equipment, land or facilities, (other than taxes described in section 164 that are paid or accrued by a taxpayer in connection with the acquisition of property described in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(J) of this section, and which are treated as part of the cost of such acquired property); * * * * (vii) P ra ctica l cap acity . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, the use, directly or indirectly, of the \"practical capacity concept\" is not permitted under this section. For purposes of this section, the practical capacity concept is defined as any concept, method, procedure, or formula (such as the practical capacity concept described in \u00a7 1.471-11 (d)(4)) whereunder fixed costs are not capitalized because of the relationship between the actual production at the taxpayer's production facility and the Federal Register / VoL 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations 29379 I \"practical capacity\" of such facility. For purposes of this section, the practical capacity of a facility shall include either the practical capacity or theoretical capacity of the facility, as defined in \u00a7 1.471-ll(d)(4), or any other similar determination of productive or operating capacity. Under this section, the practical capacity concept may not be used with respect to any activity to which this section applies. i.e ., production or resale activities. For purposes of this section, a taxpayer shall not be considered as utilizing the practical capacity concept solely because the taxpayer properly does not capitalize costs described in paragraph (b)(2)(v) of this section, relating to certain costs attributable to temporarily idle equipment. * * * * * (5) S im p lifie d m e t h o d o f a c c o u n tin g f o r p r o d u c t io n c o s t s . * * * (vii) S ection 481(a) adju stm en t Taxpayers using the simplified production method must use such method for purposes of both allocating costs incurred after the effective date of this section and for revaluing their inventories under the change in method of accounting required under this section.

See paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to the methods permitted for inventory revaluations and the calculation of the adjustment under section 481(a). * * * * * (c) S p e c i a l r u le s f o r p r o p e r t y p r o d u c e d in a fa r m in g b u s in e s s . * * * (4) D e fin itio n s \u2014(i) F a rm in g b u s in e s s . * * * (C) [1) For purposes of this section, the term \"farming business\" does not include the processing of commodities or products beyond those activities which are normally incident to the growing, raising or harvesting of such products. (2) Thus, for example, assume the taxpayer, a C corporation, is in the business of growing and harvesting wheat and other grains. The taxpayer processes grain that it has harvested inorder to produce breads, cereals, and other similar food products, which it then sells to customers in the course of its business. Although the taxpayer is in the farming business with respect to the growing and harvesting of grain, the taxpayer is not in the farming business with respect to the processing of such grains to produce food products that it sells to customers. (5) Similarly, assume the taxpayer is in the business of raising poultry or other livestock. The taxpayer then uses such livestock in a meat processing operation in which the livestock are slaughtered, processed, and packaged or canned in preparation for their sale to customers. Although the taxpayer is in the farming business with respect to the raising of livestock, the taxpayer is not in the farming business with respect to the meat processing operation. [4) However, under this section the term \"farming business\" does include processing activities which are normally incident to the growing, raising of harvesting or agricultural products. For example, assume a taxpayer is in the business of growing fruits and vegetables. When the fruits and vegetables are ready to be harvested, the taxpayer picks, washes, inspects, and packages the fruits and vegetables for sale. Such activities are normally incident to the raising of these crops by farmers. The taxpayer will be considered to be in the business of farming with respect to the growing of fruits and vegetables, and the processing activities incident to their harvest. * * * * * [5) In ven tory m ethods - \u2014* * * (iii) A v a ila b ility to p rop erty u sed in trad e o r bu sin ess. The farm-price method or the unit-livestock-price method may be used by any taxpayer to allocate costs to any plant or animal under this section, regardless of whether the plant or animal is held or treated as inventory property by the taxpayer. Thus, for example, a taxpayer may use the unit-livestock-price method to account for the costs of raising livestock which will be used in the trade or business of farming (e.g., a breeding animal or a dairy cow) although the property in question is not inventory property. * * * * * (d) D efin ition s an d s p e c ia l ru les relatin g to p rop erty a cq u ired fo r r e s a le * * * (3) S im p lified m eth od o f accou n tin g fo r r e s a le co sts * * * (ii) C osts req u ired to b e cap italized . it it it (A) O ff-site storag e o r w arehousing \u2014 [1) D efinition, (i) Costs attributable tothe operation of off-site storage or w arehousing facilities (\"off-site storage fa cilities\") under this section are required to be cap italized with respect to inventory. (ii) For purposes o f this section , an off-site storage facility is defined as any storage or w arehousing facility that is not an on-site storage facility. An on-site storage facility is a facility w hich is physically attach ed to, and an integral part of, a retail sales facility w here the taxp ayer sells m erchandise stored at the facility to retail custom ers physically present a t the facility (\"on-site sa le s\"). (iii) For purposes of this section, a retail custom er is defined as the final consum er o f the m erchandise in question. A retail custom er does not include a person who resells the m erchandise to others, such as a con tractor or m anufacturer who incorporates the m erchandise into another product for sale to custom ers.

(/ V ) Thus, for example, a catalog or mail order center which stores merchandise for shipment to customers who purchase such merchandise through orders placed over the telephone, or orders delivered in the mail, is not an on-site storage facility, and thus is treated as an off-site storage facility. - (v) Similarly, a \"pooled stock facility\" which functions as a \"back-up\" regional storage facility for particular retail sales outlets in the nearby area is not an on\u00ad site storage facility, and is thus treated as an off-site storage facility. (vi) Moreover, a storage or warehousing area operated by a person making sales of goods \"wholesale\" to persons physically present at the facility who in turn resell the goods to others, is not an on-site storage facility because such facility is not an integral part of a retail sales facility. * * * it (C) H andling, p rocessin g , assem bly , an d repackagin g. * * * (3) E xception fo r distribu tion costs. For the purpose of this paragraph (d)(3), handling costs shall not include distribution costs. Distribution costs are defined as the costs of delivering goods directly to an unrelated customer, e.g., costs incurred in delivering an item from a storage facility to a customer's home or a customer's sales facility where the item will be resold. Except as provided 29380 Federal Register / VoL 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations in paragraph (d)(3)(ii)(C)(4) of this section, distribution costs do not include costs of transporting an item from a storage facility to a store or outlet of the taxpayer where the sale of the item occurs. [4] Custom d eliv ery o f o rd ered item s. Costs incurred in delivering goods froma storage facility to a store of the taxpayer where the sale of the goods occurs are presumed to be handling costs allocable to the property and not distribution costs incurred for delivery of goods directly to the customer. This presumption can be overcome only if the taxpayer can demonstrate that a delivery to the taxpayer's store or other selling location is made to fill an identifiable order of a particular customer (placed by such customer before the delivery of the goods occurs) for the particular goods in question. Factors that may demonstrate the existence of a specific, identifiable delivery include the following: (/ ) The customer has paid for the item in advance of delivery; {/ # ) The customer has submitted a written order for the item; [iii\\ The item is not normally available at the retail store for on-site customer purchases; or (iv) The item will be returned to the storage facility (and not held for sale at the store or selling location) if the customer cancels an order. * * * (5) S ection 481(a) adjustm ent. Taxpayers using the simplified resale method must use such method for purposes of both allocating costs incurred after the effective date of this section and for revaluing their inventories under the change in method of accounting required under this section. See paragraph (e) of this section for rules relating to the methods permitted for inventory revaluations and the calculation of the adjustment under section 481(a). (e) In v en tories\u2014[ 1) In g en eral, (i) Under this section, taxpayers are required to change their method of accounting with respect to inventory property, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31,1986. The required change in method of accounting applies to inventory produced by the taxpayer, as well as to inventory acquired by the taxpayer for resale. The change in method of accounting is to be made by revaluing the items or costs included in beginning inventory in the year of change as if the new capitalization rules of section 263A and this section had been in effect during all prior periods. In revaluing inventory costs under this procedure, all of thecapitalization provisions of this section [e.g., the requirement to capitalize the entire amount of tax depreciation and cost recovery allowances with respect to equipment and facilities and the repeal of the practical capacity concept), shall apply to all inventory costs accumulated in prior periods. The necessity to revalue beginning inventory as if the new capitalization rules had been in effect for all prior periods includes, for example, the revaluation of costs or layers incurred in taxable years preceding the transition period to the full absorption method of inventory costing as described in \u00a7 1.47i-ll(e), regardless of whether a taxpayer employed a \"cut-off' method under those regulations. The difference between the inventory as originally valued and the inventory as revalued by applying the new capitalization rules is equal to the amount of the adjustment required under section 481(a). For example, with respect to inventories of films, sound recordings, video tapes, books, and other similar property, the taxpayer shall revalue the costs of such items under the principles of this paragraph (e)(1). (ii) Pursuant to the change in method of accounting required under this section, taxpayers are required to revalue the amount of deferred gain or loss resulting from the sale or exchange of inventory property in a deferred intercompany transaction, to an amount equal to the deferred gain or loss that would have resulted had the cost of goods sold for that inventory property been determined under the capitalization rules of this section. The requirement of the preceding sentence shall apply with respect to both property produced by the taxpayer, or property acquired by the taxpayer for resale. In addition, the requirements of this paragraph shall apply only to the deferred gain or loss of the taxpayer as of the beginning of the year of change in method of accounting required under this section. (See \u00a7 1.1502-13(c)(2), which separately requires that the capitalization rules of this section shall apply in determining the cost of goods sold for deferred intercompany transactions occurring after the effective date of section 263A.) Corresponding changes to the adjustment required under section 481(a) shall be made with respect to any adjustment of the deferred gain or loss required under this paragraph. Moreover, the requirements of this paragraph shall apply regardless of whether the taxpayer has any items in beginning inventory as of the year of change in method of accounting. The terms \"deferred gain or loss\" and\"deferred intercompany transaction\" as used herein are defined in \u00a7 1.1502-13. (iii) The provisions of paragraph (e)(1)(h) of this section are illustrated by the following example. (A) E xam ple. Assume that corporation A, a member of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated federal income tax return on a calendar year, manufactures and sells inventory property to corporation B, a member of the same affiliated group, in 1985. The gain from the sale of the inventory property is deferred by A under \u00a7 1.1502- 13(c) of the regulations. As of the beginning of the year of change in method of accounting (January 1,1987), the inventory property is still held by corporation B based on the particular inventory method of accounting used by B for Federal income tax purposes (e.g., LIFO or FIFO). The property was sold by A to B in 1985 for $150; the cost of goods sold with respect to the property under the law in effect at the time the inventory was produced (see \u00a7 1.471-3) was $100, resulting in a gain of $50 which A deferred under \u00a7 1.1502-13{c). The deferred intercompany gain as of January 1,1987, with respect to the transaction, is $50. (B) Under this section, A is required to revalue the amount of deferred intercompany gain resulting from the sale of the inventory property to an amount equal to the deferred gain which would have resulted had the cost of goods sold for that inventory property been determined under the capitalization rules of this section. Assume that the cost of the inventory under the capitalization rules of this section would have been $110, had the capitalization rules applied to A's manufacture of the property in 1985. Thus, A is required to revalue the amount of deferred gain to $40 (i.e., $150 less $110), necessitating a negative adjustment to the deferred gain of $10. Moreover, A is required to increase its section 481(a) adjustment by $10 in order to prevent the omission of such amount by virtue of the decrease in the deferred intercompany gain. (iv) In determining the amount of intercompany gain which would have resulted had the cost of goods sold for that inventory property been determined under the capitalization rules of this section, a taxpayer may use the other methods and procedures otherwise properly available to that particular taxpayer in revaluing inventory under this section, including, if appropriate, the various simplified methods provided in this section and the various procedures described in paragraph (e) of this section. * * * * * (3) Timing o f sectio n 481(a) adjustm ent * * * (iii) If paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section does not apply, the section 481(a) adjustment is to be taken into account ratably over the number of tax years (not to exceed 4) that the taxpayer has engaged in the particular trade or F^cderal^Register^/ Vo K 52, No. -152 / Friday, August 7,; 19&7- / Rules and Regulations29381 business of producing property or acquiring property for resale to which the adjustment applies. * * * * (7) A djustm ents to in ven tory co sts from p rio r y ears. * * * (iii} E x cep tion s from g en era l rule. Costs which are described in this paragraph (e)(7) (iii) shall be eligible for the restatement adjustment procedure under paragraph (e)(9) of this section even though such costs do not otherwise meet the requirements for such eligibility under the provisions of paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section. Except as provided in this paragraph (e)(7Xiii), no other costs shall be eligible for the restatement procedure unless those costs satisfy the requirements of paragraph (e)(7)(i) of this section. Costs described in this paragraph which are eligible for the restatement adjustment procedure are: (A) Costs attributable to different depreciation and cost recovery (\"depreciation\") methods used for Federal income tax purposes, except that no adjustment shall be made for \"applicable pre-cutoff years\" as defined in paragraph (e)(8) of this section; and (B) Differences in the percentage of fixed indirect production costs which were expensed due to unutilized capacity by taxpayers in prior years using the practical capacity concept, as described in \u00a7 1.471-ll(d)(4), subject to the consecutive year requirement as described in paragraph (e)(7)(iv) of this section. Moreover, any taxpayer adjusting the revaluation factor with respect to practical capacity shall make such adjustment after the revaluation factor is adjusted for all other eligible costs as permitted under this section. In addition, if such other eligible costs are fixed indirect production costs, the adjustments attributable to such eligible costs shall be taken into account in determining the amount of fixed indirect production costs which are utilized in adjusting the revaluation factor with respect to the practical capacity concept. (iv) C on secu tive y e a r requ irem ent. Any taxpayer adjusting the revaluation factor to reflect differences in the percentages of fixed indirect production costs which were expensed under the practical capacity concept, shall only make such adjustments for consecutive years. Thus, for example, assume a taxpayer's beginning inventory balance as of the year of change in method of accounting consists of costs accumulated in years 1983,1982,1980 and 1978. The taxpayer may not apply the restatement adjustment procedure with respect to the practical capacityconcept for the years 1983 and 1980, unless such procedure is similarly applied for 1982. However, the taxpayer may apply the restatement adjustment procedure only to the year 1983 (or for the years 1983 and 1982), with no restatement adjustment with respect to the practical capacity concept occurring for earlier years. * * * * * (9) R estatem en t adjustm ent p roced u re. * * * (ii) E xam ples o f restatem en t adjustm ent p roced u re. * * * E x am p le (4J. Assume that taxpayer A is eligible to make a restatement adjustment by virtue of differences in the percentage of fixed indirect production costs which were expensed under the practical capacity concept. Assume that during the revaluation period, A's production facilities functioned, on a weighted average basis, at 60 percent of practical capacity. Assume the revaluation factor before adjustment of data to reflect the differences in operating capacity is the same factor as in example (1), i.e a percentage restatement change for 1984 of .29. A determines that during the taxable year 1983, A's facilities operated at 70 percent of capacity. Under the restatement procedure, A determines, using reasonable assumptions and estimates, the total amount of inventoriable costs under A's prior method of accounting which would have been incurred in 1984, had the facilities been operating at 70 percent of capacity for that year. Using this information, A determines that the total inventoriable costs under A's prior method of accounting for 1984 would have been $38,000. (This difference is attributable to the fact that A's facilities functioned at a higher rate of capacity in 1983 than in 1984). The total inventoriable costs under this section continue to be $45,150. The restatement adjustment determined under this paragraph would then be equal to .19. A would make similar calculations with respect to 1985 and 1986. The weighted average of such amounts for each of the three years in the revaluation period would then be determined as in the example in paragraph (e)(6)(iv)(C) of this section. Such weighted average would be used to revalue the cost layer for 1983. With respect to cost layers incurred during the revaluation years, no adjustment of the revaluation factor would occur. As provided in paragraph (e)(7)(iv) of this section, any taxpayer using the restatement adjustment procedure with respect to the practical capacity concept must do so for consecutive years. E x am p le (5). Assume the same facts as in example (4), except that during the taxable year 1983, B's facilities functioned at 50 percent of capacity. Using this information, B determines that the total inventoriable costs under B's prior method of accounting for 1984 would have been $32,000 had the facilities been operating at 50 percent of capacity for that year. The total inventoriable costs under this section continue to be $45,150. The restatement adjustment determined under this paragraph would then be equal to ,41. A would make similar calculations with respectto 1985 and 1986. The weighted average of such amounts for each of the three years in the revaluation period would then be determined as in the example in paragraph (e)(6)(rv)(C) of this section. Such weighted average would be used to revalue the cost layer for 1983. With respect to cost layers incurred during the revaluation years, no adjustment of the revaluation factor would occur. * * * * * (11) C hange in m eth od s o f accounting. * * * (iii) D efinition o f ch an g es in m eth od requ ired. For purposes of this paragraph (e)(ll), a change in method of accounting is required under this paragraph (e)(ll) if such change is necessary in order for the taxpayer to properly capitalize and allocate costs with respect to production and resale activities in the manner prescribed in this section. A change in method of accounting may be described in the preceding sentence irrespective of whether the taxpayer's previous method of accounting resulted in the capitalization of more (or fewer) costa than the costs required to be capitalized under this section, and irrespective of whether the taxpayer's previous method of accounting was a correct method under th\u00e9 law in effect at that time. A change in method of accounting is not required under this paragraph (e)(ll) if such change relates to factors other than those described herein. For example, a required change in method of accounting does not include a change from an inventory valuation method to another inventory valuation method, such as\u2014 (A) A change from LIFO (or FIFO) to FIFO (or LIFO); or (B) A change in accounting method for an inventory of securities from market value to cost. In addition, a required change in method of accounting does not include a change within inventory Valuation methods, such as a change from the ''double- extension\" method to the \"link-chain method\", or a change in the method used for determining the number of pools. * * * * * (v) O rdering ru le fo r o th er ch an g es in m eth od o f accounting. A change in method of accounting required under this section for any taxable year shall be deemed to occur prior to any other change in method of accounting for such taxable year. Thus, for example, assume a calendar year taxpayer who produces inventory property is required to change its method of accounting under this section for its taxable year beginning January 1,1987. The taxpayer also desires to change from the LIFO to the 29382.. . , r v r T \\ r-W r* h v > f i l l i p ' Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 f Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations FIFO method for the same taxable year, and complies with all necessary procedures to effectuate such Change, including obtaining the consent of the Commissioner to such change in method of accounting, if required under such procedures. The change in method of accounting required by section 263A shall be deemed to occur first, and such change in method of accounting (including the calculation of the section 481(a) adjustment) shall be based on the taxpayer's inventory records existing as of January 1,1987, under the LIFO method used by the taxpayer. After the change in method of accounting under section 263A is deemed to be made, and the amount of the resulting section 481(a) adjustment is determined, the change in method of accounting from LIFO to FIFO is then deemed to occur. There is need for immediate guidance with respect to the provisions contained in this Treasury decision. For this reason, it is found impractical to issue this Treasury decision with notice and public procedure under subsection (b) of section 553 of Title 5 of the United States Code or subject to the effective date limitation of subsection (d) of that section.

SUMMARY: On July 1,1987, the EPA promulgated national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerortietric diameter of a nominal 10 micron of less (PMio) (see 52 FR 24634). The EPA also promulgated policies and regulations by which it will implement the PMio NAAQS (52 FR 24672). In accordance with these policies, EPA has categorized areas of the Nation into three groups based on the likelihood that the existing State implementation plan (SIP) must be revised to protect the PMio NAAQS. Areas with a strong likelihood of violating the PMio NAAQS and requiring substantial SIP revisions were placed in Group I; areas where attainment of the PMio NAAQS is uncertain and the SIP may require only slight adjustment were placed in Group II; and areas with a strong likelihood of attaining the PMio NAAQS, and therefore probably having an adequate control strategy, were placed in Group III. By this notice, EPA is identifying the Group I and Group II areas in each State. The remainder of the State not in Group I or II is placed in Group III. ADDRESSES: Information supporting the placement of each area in Group I, II, or III can be obtained from the respective EPA Regional Office which services the particular State.

Telephone: (919) 541-5351 (FTS 629-5351). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On July 1,1987 (52 FR 24672), EPA promulgated in 40 CFR Parts 51 and 52 policies and regulations by which it will implement the PMio NAAQS. The EPA's policies for developing SIP's for PMio are discussed fully in section IV.C. of the preamble to that Federal Register (52 FR 24679). Also as noted in that preamble, section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (Act) requires that each State adopt and submit, within 9 months after revision of a NAAQS, a SIP providing for attainment and maintenance of the primary NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable but no later than 3 years from the date EPA approves the SIP. Due to a lack of PMio ambient monitoring data, EPA considered different ways of implementing this requirement, including simply calling upon States to develop and submit a full PMio attainment demonstration and control strategy for every area of the country within the 9-month period. The EPA believes, however, that such a requirement would be unreasonable in many areas. An analysis of ambient total suspended particulate (TSP) data for 1984-1986 in conjunction with the methodology described in EPA's \"probability guideline\" (Procedures for Estimating Probability of Nonattainment of PMio NAAQS Using Total 29389 Federa! Register / Voi. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Rules and Regulations Suspended Particulate Matter or PMio Data, EPA 450/4-86-017} indicates that there could be from 50 to 150 counties in which the PMio NAAQS will not be attained. While these numbers are the best indication at this time of the potential nonattainment situation for PMio, they are only estimates and will probably change as new ambient PMio data become available. The estimates are, however, useful as an indication of the degree of PMio SIP development that may eventually be necessary. The key point is that many of the 3141 counties in the Nation may need no additional particulate matter SIP provisions to meet the revised NAAQS. Thus, for many areas, the existing TSP SIP's may already provide for timely attainment and maintenance of the PMio NAAQS. To call upon areas that almost certainly have adequate SIP's to resubmit those SIFs along with full attainment demonstrations would be unnecessary and therefore wasteful of limited State resources.* There are, also, several areas where available data indicate that air quality may be close to the level of the NAAQS. Many of these areas may actually be shown, with more ambient data, to be in attainment or may need only minor SIP changes. Therefore, EPA believes that a demand for immediate submissions of attainment demonstrations and control strategies for all of these areas is unreasonable when additional PMio air quality data could provide a more clear picture of the status of the area. On the other hand, due to applie&ble Act requirements and the potential environmental risk, the Administrator did not consider it reasonable to permit delay in the development of PMio control programs for areas with severe air quality problems until adequate PMio data were available to show that the area was violating the PMio NAAQS. For the reasons given immediately above, EPA adopted a policy by which it is dividing all areas of the country into three categories: (1} Areas with a strong likelihood of violating the PMio NAAQS and requiring substantial SIP adjustment (Group I), (2) areas where attainment of the standards is possible and existing SIP's probably need less adjustment (Group II), and (3} areas with a strong likelihood of attaining the PMio NAAQS and therefore needing only adjustments 1 Developing a sound attainment demonstration is generally resource intensive. It requires an in-depth study of the emission characteristics of specific sources in the demonstration area and a thorough evaluation of the anticipated effects of various emission levels from those sources. The EPA estimates it could require up to 4 work years and $250,000 to develop a SIP for each area found to be violating the NAAQS.to the applicable prevention of significant deterioration/new source review (PSD/NSR) and monitoring provisions in their S IF s (Group HI}. The EPA used a three-step process to categorize areas into Groups I, II, and III. First, where only ambient TSP data or limited amounts of PMio data were available, EPA in cooperation with State agencies used those data and the probability guideline to classify areas preliminarily as Group I, II, or III. The EPA presumed that, at a minimum, the (1) areas with a probability of not attaining the PMio standard of at least 95 percent fit into Group I, (2) areas with a probability of between 20 and 95 percent fit into Group H , and (3) areas with a probability of less than 20 percent fit into Group III. Second, EPA's Regional Offices, after consulting with the appropriate State and local agencies, evaluated the existing TSP SIFs, available existing source data, and other relevant information for each area in their jurisdiction (1) to see whether information other than the probability of nonattainment justified changing the group for an area, and (2) to determine the appropriate group for areas that the EPA could not classify under the first step because ambient TSP data were unavailable. Third, to insure national consistency, all grouping was reviewed by representatives of EPA's Headquarters staff and Regional Offices. The EPA has completed the process of categorizing areas and the Group I and II areas are listed by State in the following section of this notice. Any area of a State not listed as Group I or H is considered to be in Group HI. The requirements and schedules for developing PMio S IF s are different for Group I, II, and HI areas. Immediate action to develop a full SIP that will bring about attainment and maintenance of the PMio NAAQS is required for Group I areas because they have a strong likelihood of violating the NAAQS and requiring substantia! revision of the existing SIP. Since the attainment status of Group H areas is uncertain, time is allowed for additional monitoring of ambient PMio concentrations before revision of the existing control strategy is required. Group HI areas have a strong likelihood of attaining the PMio NAAQS. Therefore, for Group III areas, the State need only submit SIP revisions for the preconstruction review program and monitoring network (52 FR 24681) within 9 months. The requirements for SIP development for each group are discussed fully at 52 FR 24680-24682.The Group I and H areas of concern are generally described below as a county, a township, or a planning area. These descriptions are only the initial definitions of the areas that must be investigated in the SIP development process. In the process of monitoring and modeling PMio concentrations and determining the extent of sources of PMio emissions that impact the areas, the States will better define the boundaries of the area that is or may be violating the standards. In 1977, Congress added section 107(d)(1) to the Act which required EPA to designate areas as nonattainment, unclassifiable, or attainment for the NAAQS existing at that time. In 40 CFR Part 81, EPA made such designations for TSP. Since the PMio NAAQS is being implemented under the provisions of section 110 of the Act, such designations are not necessary for PMi\u00ae. Thus, EPA will not make such designations for PMio (see 52 FR 24682). However, EPA will retain the TSP designations to implement the requirements of Part C of the Act relating to PSD (see 52 FR 24685).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 22,1987, the Board proposed further extensive revisions to its regulations regarding the corporate governance of Federal associations in order to update and clarify these regulations (52 FR 25870 (July 9,1987)). Due to the magnitude of various proposed revisions regarding corporate governance, the Board had previously presented certain of the proposals in parts issued separately for public comment. Overall, the proposed regulations would reorganize portions of Subchapter C (the regulations for federally chartered associations) and amend and add sections to provide a more cohesive and complete body of rules for the corporate governance of Federgl associations. Part I was proposed on September 13,1985,50 FR 38832 (Sept. 25,1985). Part II was proposed on November 22,1985, 50 FR 52482 (Dec. 24,1985). Revisions of the Board's current regulations governing conservators' and receivers' were proposed on November 8,1985, 50 FR 48970 (Nov. 27,1985) as a portion of Corporate Governance Part IV. The comment periods on these previously issued proposals have expired. On June 22,1987, the Board proposed for public comment Parts III and those portions of Part IV not proposed by the Board on November 8,1985. In the summary to Parts III and IV, the Board invited comments on Parts I and II in conjunction with Parts III and IV. By its action today, the Board wishes to clarify the portion of the summary printed in the Federal Register of Thursday, July 9,1987 at page 25870, first and second columns, concerning the solicitation of comments. The Board intends to solicit comments on Parts I and II of Corporate Governance, previously proposed, and those aspects of Parts III and IV proposed on June 22, 1987, for a 60-day comment period to expire on September 8,1987. The Board did not intend to solicit comments on the revisions to the Board's regulations governing conservators and receivers which were proposed on November 8, 1985 as part of Corporate Governance, Part IV . The comment period on that proposal expired on Janaury 28,1986. Pursuant to 12 CFR 508.11 and 508.14, the Board finds that, because of the minor, technical nature of this corrective amendment, notice and public comment are unnecessary, as is the 30-day delay of the effective date.

Discussion The French Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l'Aviation Civile (DGAC) has, in accordance with existing provisions of a bilateral airworthiness agreement, notified the FAA of an unsafe condition which may exist in Falcon 10 airplanes. There have been reports of structural damage found in the fuselage frames and skin of four Falcon 10 airplanes. The damage was caused by electrical arcing across a loose electrical grounding connection for the air conditioning freon compressor motor. The grounding connection may become loose due to the vibration of the compressor itself. Avions Marcel Dassault\u2014Breguet Aviation (AMD-BA) issued Service Bulletin AMD-BA F10-262, dated December 22,1986, which describes procedures for periodic inspections and testing of the electrical grounding connection. It also describes the process for replacing the grounding cable with an installation which is not susceptible to vibration. When the grounding cable has been replaced in accordance with the service bulletin, the periodic inspections and testing are no longer necessary. The DGAC has declared this Service Bulletin to be mandatory, and has issued Airworthiness Directive 86- 188-21(B), dated December 23,1986, which requires compliance with the service bulletin. This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated in the United States under the provisions of \u00a7 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since these conditions are likely to exist or develop on airplanes of this model registered in the United States, an AD is proposed that would require periodic inspections and testing of the grounding connection for the air conditioning freon compressor motor until the modified grounding cable has been installed, in accordance with the service bulletin previously mentioned. Any structural damage found would be required to be repaired in a manner approved by the FAA. It is estimated that 140 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this AD, that it would require approximately 8 manhours per airplane to accomplish the required replacement of the ground cable, and that the average labor cost would be $40 per manhour. The cost of materials is estimated to be $20 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of this AD to U.S. operators is estimated to be $47,600. For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this document (1) involves a proposed regulation which is not major under Executive Order 12291 and (2) is not a significant rule pursuant to the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 F R 11034; February 26, 1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because of the minimal cost of compliance per airplane ($340). A copy of a draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Aviation safety, Aircraft. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend \u00a7 39.13 of Part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: PART 39\u2014 [AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for Part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 11.89. \u00a7 39.13 [Amended] By the following new airworthiness directive:Avions Marcel Dassault\u2014Breguet Aviation (AMD-BA): Applies to all Falcon 10 airplanes, certificated in any category, unless AMD-BA modification M736 has been accomplished. Compliance is required as specified, unless previously accomplished. To prevent structural damage to aircraft frames and skin in the vicinity of the electrical grounding connection for the air conditioning freon compressor motor, accomplish the following: A.

SUMMARY: This notice proposes a new airworthiness directive (AD), appEcable to certain Boeing Model 767 series airplanes, which would require modification of the plastic inner window on the passenger door mid liner panel. This proposal is prompted by a report of a loose inner window (dust cover) which interfered with the movement o f the upper liner and prevented the door from opening fully. This condition, if not corrected, could cause the door to jam during an emergency, thus delaying and possibly jeopardizing successful emergency evacuation of an airplane. d a t e : Comments must be received no later than September 30,1987. a d d r e s s e s : Send comments on the proposal in duplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration, Northwest Mountain Region, Office of the Regional Counsel (Attn: ANM-103), Attention: Airworthiness Rules Docket No. 87-NM- 97-AD, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C - 68966, Seattle, Washington 98168.

All communications received on or before the closing date for comments specified above will be considered by the Administrator before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this Notice may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizing each FAA/public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Availability of NPRM Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the FAA, Northwest Mountain Region, Office of the Regional Counsel (Attn: ANM-103), Attention: Airworthiness Rules Docket No. 87-NM-97-AD, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington 98168. Discussion One operator reported that a passenger door on a Boeing Model 767 airplane could not be opened more than 2.5 feet in the manual mode. Investigation showed that the plastic inner window (dust cover) that is bonded to the door mid liner panel had come loose and interfered with the normal movement of the upper liner, preventing the door from being opened. A subsequent fleet inspection by the operator found a large percentage of loose inner windows. The airplane manufacturer conducted a test with the mid liner window displaced slightly from its normal position and the door in the emergency mode. During this test, the door jammed when it was approximately 61 inches open, as compared to the normal opening size of 72 inches. The escape slide deployed and inflated normally. In another test with the window displaced further (maximum displacement) from its normal position, the window came loose when the door was opened in the emergency mode and the door opened fully.The FAA has revi\u00e8wed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767- 25A0092, dated June 18,1987, which describes a modification procedure to install aluminum retainers along the top and bottom of the window to mechanically secure the window to the door liner. This modification will assure that the inner window does not come loose. Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of this same type design, an AD is proposed which would require inspection and subsequent modification of the inner window on the door m id liner m accordance with the service bulletin previously mentioned. It is estimated that 77 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this AD, that it would take approximately 16 manhours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 per manhour. The cost of materials is estimated at $200 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $64,680. For these reasons, the FAA has determined that this document (1) involves a proposed regulation which is not major under Executive Order 12291 and (2) is not a significant rule pursuant to the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule, if promulgated, w ill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of snail entities because few, if any, Model 767 airplanes are operated by small entities. A copy of a draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Aviation safety, Aircraft. The Proposed Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend \u00a7 39.13 of Part 39 of the Federal Aviatioh Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows; PART 39\u2014 f AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for Part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. 1354(a), 12,1983); and 14 CFR 11.89. 29390 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules \u00a7 39.13 [Am ended] 2. By adding the following new airworthiness directive: Boeing: Applies to Model 767 series airplanes listed in Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767-25A0092, dated June 18,1987, certificated in any Category. Compliance required as indicated, unless previously accomplished. To ensure that the entry and service doors cannot become jammed due to a loose mid liner dust cover, accomplish the following: A. Within the next 30 days after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 90 days, visually inspect the door mid liner for evidence of dust cover disbonding. Disbonding is identified by the dust cover moving away from edges of the reveal. If the dust cover shows evidence of disbonding, prior to further flight, modify the dust cover in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767-25A0092, dated June 18,1987, or later FAA-approved revisions.

Discussion During an automatic go-around maneuver on a McDonnell Douglas Modal DC-9-80 series airplane demonstration flight for the FAA, a simulated engine loss resulted in an electrical transient, which caused the Honeywell P/N HG280D80 Digital Air Data Computer (DADC) to send an erroneous low value of computed airspeed to the Digital Flight Guidance Computer (DFGC). The DFGC used this value as a go-around speed reference and generated a large pitch-up command when it compared the actual airspeed to the erroneous reference airspeed. The automatic go-around demonstration was terminated by the pilot when the stick shaker was activated by the stall warning system. Investigation by Honeywell indicated that a complementary metal oxide semiconductor random access memory chip installed on Microcomputer Circuit Card Assembly (CCA) A1 could output erroneous computed airspeed, Mach, and total pressure data, without a failure warning, in the event of a power interrupt to the DADC. Modification 8 to the DADC, which consists of the addition of a transistor to the Circuitry on CCA A l, prevents this from occurring. This transistor had been previously incorporated by Honeywell as a product improvement on DADC manufactured since May 1983, but no marking of any kind was put on the DADC to identify it as having incorporated the transistor. DADC manufactured after February 1987, Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules29391 however, have the transistor incorporated and the modification is identified by a Modification 8 marking on the D ADC. The FA A has reviewed and approved M cDonnell Douglas Corporation Service Bulletin 34-177, dated April 28,1987, which describes inspection procedures to determine if Modification 8 is incorporated in the Honeywell P/N HG280D80 DADC installed on Model DC-9-80 series airplanes* Honeywell Service Bulletin HG280D80-34-09, dated March 15,1987, referenced in the McDonnell Douglas service bulletin, provides instructions for inspection of all Honeywell P/N HG280D80 DADC and CCA A l units, and modification instructions to bring any unit without the transistor to a Modification 8 level. Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of this same type design, an AD is proposed; which would require inspection and modification, if necessary, of Honeywell P/N HG280D80 DADC within \u00ce2 months after the effective date of this (AD), in accordance with the service bulletin previously mentioned* It is estimated that 366 airplanes of U S. registry would be affected by this AD, that it would take approximately 4.2 manhours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 per manhour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $61,488. For these reasons, the FAA has determined that this document (1) involves a proposed regulation which is not major under Executive Order 12291 and (2) is not a significant rule pursuant to the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 F R 11034; February 26,1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because of the minimal cost of compliance per airplane ($168). A copy of a draft regulatory evaluation prepared for-this action is contained in the regulatory docket. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Aviation safety, Aircraft.

The preamble to the temporary regulations provides a discussion of the rules. The final regulations, which this document proposes to base on those temporary regulations, would amend Part 1 of Title 26 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Special Analyses The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has determined that this proposed rule is not a major rule as defined in Executive Order 12291. Accordingly, a Regulatory Impact analysis is not required. Although this document is a notice of proposed rulemaking that solicits public comments, the Internal Revenue service has concluded that the regulations proposed herein are interpretative and that the notice and public procedure requirements of 5 U.S.C. 553 do not apply. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6). Comments and Requests for a Public Hearing Before adopting these proposed regulations, consideration will be given to any written comments that are submitted (preferably eight copies) to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. All comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A public hearing will be held upon written request to the Commissioner by any person who has submitted comments. If a public hearing is held, notice of the time and place will be published in the Federal Register. Drafting Information The principal author of these regulations is Paulette C. Galanko of the Legislation and Regulations Division, Office of Chief Counsel, Internal Revenue Service. However, personnel from other offices of the Internal Revenue Service and Treasury Department participated in developing the regulation on matters of both substance and style.

Telephone: (919) 541-5351 (FTS 629-5351). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORM ATION: Since 1977, EPA has allowed States with rural fugitive dust areas (RFDA's) to discount fugitive dust in developing and enforcing a State implementation plan (SIP) for attainment and maintenance of the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter (PM). On July 1,1987, at 52 FR 24634, EPA announced its final decisions concerning the indicator and levels of the NAAQS for PM and the requirements for implementing those new standards. Also, on July 1,1987, EPA solicited comments on alternative SIP requirements for RFDA's and on the adequacy of the definitions which are used in identifying RFDA's. The EPA requested that comments be submitted within 30 days or by July 31,1987. By a letter of July 15,1987, Larry A. Boggs, representing the AMC, requested the comment period be extended by 30 days to allow them to developmeaningful comments. (A copy of that letter has been placed in Docket A -87- 01.) The EPA believes that such a request is reasonable and is therefore extending the comment period on the proposal for the Fugitive Dust Policy until August 31,1987.

ACTIO N : Proposed Rulemaking. _________ SUMMARY: This Federal Register notice proposes approval of Louisiana Air Quality Regulations Sections 17.41.1- 17.14.3 for Good Engineering Practice- Stack Height (GEP-SH) and Dispersion Techniques. This proposed GEP-SH SIP revision is intended to implement section 123 of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and Federal regulations at 40 CFR Part 51. If approved, it will enable the. State to ensure that the degree of emission limitation required for the control of any air pollutant under its SIP is not affected by that portion of any stack height which exceeds GEP-SH or by any other dispersion technique. Through today's notice, EPA solicits public comments on its proposed approval of the Louisiana State GEP-SH regulations. The rationale for the proposed approval is contained in this notice and further documented in a T ech n ical Support D ocum ent which is available for public review. d a t e : Comments must be received on this proposed action on or before September 8,1987.

Thomas D iggs; Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6* 1445 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Texas 75202, telephone (214)655-7214. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 123 of the Clean Air Act, amended August 1977, regulates the manner in which techniques for dispersion of pollutants from a source may be considered in setting emission limitations; Specifically, section 123 requires that the degree of emission limitation shall not be affected by the portion of a stack which exceeds GEP- SH or by \"any other dispersion technique.\" To fulfill this requirement of the Act, EPA initially promulgated GEP-SH regulations limiting stack height credits and other dispersion techniques at 47 FR 5864 (February 8,1982). Portions of those regulations were successfully challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. See S ierra Club v. EPA, 719 F.2d 436 (D.C. Gir. 1983), resulting in their revision at 50 FR 27892 (July 8,1985). Since then, the regulations have been renumbered as part of a comprehensive restructuring and consolidation of EPA's SIP development regulations. See 51 FR 40656 (November 7,1986). Today's Federal Register proposal uses the current numbers for citation. Pursuant to section 406 (d)(2) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, EPA has required that all States (1) review and revise, as necessary, their SIPs to include provisions that limit stack height credits and dispersion techniques in accordance with the EPA's July 8,1985, revised regulations and (2) review all existing emission limitations to d\u00e9termine whether any of these limitations have been affected by : impermissible stack height credits above GEP or by any other dispersionNo\u00ab *52 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules 29393 techniques and, if so, to prepare revised limitations consistent with their revised SIPs. Today's proposal concerns only the first of these requirements. Although the State of Louisiana has reviewed and evaluated emission limitations of the existing sources by using the criteria provided in the Federal Register notice of July 8,1985, EPA will publish the results of this review and revisions, if any, to emission limitations of the affected sources under a separate notice. On July 18,1986, the Governor of Louisiana submitted a copy of the Louisiana GEP-SH Air Quality Regulations, Sections 17.14.1-17.14.3, adopted by the Secretary of the Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) on May 20,1986, as a proposed SIP revision together with supporting documents. With one exception, the LDEQ GEP-SH regulations are equivalent to the Federal regulations found at 40 CFR 51.100(z), 40 CFR 51.100(ff)\u2014 (kk), 40 CFR 51.164, and, indeed, are largely identical thereto except for minor changes to accommodate the State's regulatory format. EPA's preliminary determination indicates that the State's regulations and procedures are adequate and effective for implementation of the Federal stack height and dispersion technique regulations and section 123 of the Clean Air Act. The primary substantive requirements for implementation of section 123 through SIPs are found at 40 CFR 51.118 and 40 CFR 51.118(a) requires that SIPs provide that \"the degree of emission limitation required for any source for control of any air pollutant must not be affected by so much of any source's stack height that exceeds good engineering practice or by any other dispersion technique.\" Section 17.14.2 of the LDEQ regulations adopts this provision verbatim. 40 CFR 51.118(a) additionally requires that SIPs \"provide that before a State submits to EPA a new or revised emission limitation that is based on a good engineering practice stack height that exceeds the height allowed by \u00a7 51.100(ii) (1) or (2), the State must notify the public of the availability of the demonstration study and must provide opportunity for public hearing on it.\" Because it provides that the State \"administrative authority will notify the public of the availability of any stack height demonstration and will provide opportunity for public hearing on it,\" Section 17.14.2 of the LDEQ regulation complies with this requirement. Although the State regulation does not itself indicate that such emission limitations will be submitted to EPA forreview as SIP amendments, the Secretary of the LDEQ committed the State to submit SIP revisions to EPA for all cases subject to this section of the regulations in a letter dated September 23,1986. Like the Federal regulation, Section 17.14.2 also indicates that it \"does not restrict, in any fashion, the actual stiack height of any source,\" and includes the same \"grandfather clause\" as 40 CFR 51.118(b). With one exception, Section 17.14.3 of the State regulations similarly replicates, and thus satisfies, 40 CFR 51.164. That federal regulation requires, however, that \"before a State issues a permit to a new or modified source based on a good engineering practice stack height that exceeds the height allowed by \u00a7 51.100(ii) ( l } o r (2), The State must notify the public of the availability of the demonstration study and must provide opportunity for public hearing.\" [Emphasis added;] There is an apparent clerical error in Section 17.14,3, insofar as it fails to include a reference to subsections (2) or (3) of Section 17.14.1(e), the equivalents of subsections (i) and (ii) or 40 CFR 51.100(ii). As a result of this inadvertent error, the State regulation incorrectly suggests that there is an approvable method for determining GEP-SH other than those prescribed by 40 CFR 51;100(ii) and Section 17.14.1(e), and that new or modified source emission limitations developed pursuant to Section 17.14.1(e)(3) need not be subjected to public review. Prior to final approval of Louisiana's GEP-SH SIP revision, LDEQ must amend this area of the regulation to resolve EPA's concern. In addition to the required implementing regulations, Louisiana has adopted definitions essential for their meaningful application. The State regulatory definitions for \"emission limitation and emission 40 CFR 51.100(kk), respectively. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this proposed rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605, the Administrator of EPA has categorically certified that no proposed or final SIP 29394 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules approval will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. See 46 FR 8709 (January 27,1981). This proposal need not, therefore, be accompanied by a regulatory flexibility analysis.

A CTIO N : Proposed rule. s u m m a r y : EPA is today proposing to approve the North Carolina CO State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision for Durham County. The SIP revision was submitted to EPA by the North Carolina Division of Environmental Management (NCDEM) on December 5,1986. Through reductions in CO emissions achieved by the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP) and transportation control measures (TCMs), North Carolina has demonstrated attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO by December 31,1987. These revisions meet the requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA) and EPA policy. The public is invited to submit written comments on this proposed action. d a t e : To be considered, comments must reach us on or before September 8,1987. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to Thomas Hansen of EPA Region IV's Air Programs Branch (see EPA Region IV address below). Copies of the materials submitted by North Carolina may be examined during normal business hours at the following locations: Environmental Protection Agency, Region IV, Air Programs Branch, 345 Courtland Street, NE., Atlanta, Georgia 30365 Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, Division ofEnvironmental Management, P.O. Box 27687, Raleigh, North Carolina 27611 FOR FURTHER INFORMATION C O N TA C T: Mr. Thomas Hansen, Air Programs Branch, EPA Region IV, at the above address and telephone number 404/347- 4292 or FTS 257-2864. s u p p l e m e n t a r y i n f o r m a t i o n : Durham County, North Carolina was officially designated attainment on March 3,1978 for CO (43 FR 8962 at 9020), negating the need for a Part D SIP revision. On May 10,1979 (44 FR 27558), EPA promulgated the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance regulations (40 CFR Part 58). Pursuant to these regulations, the monitoring network in Durham County was expanded. Analysis by EPA and the State of North Carolina of ambient CO measurements collected in the Durham area indicated that, on a number of occasions, recorded levels of CO had exceeded the eight-hour NAAQS. For areas with a fully approved SIP, showing attainment, but which did not attain, EPA on February 3,1983 (48 FR 4972), announced its intention to treat such areas as \"substantially inadequate\" to assure attainment under section 110(a)(2)(H) of the CAA. EPA policy stated that CO SIP calls should be made in all cases where the highest second high measured concentration is greater than or equal to 12.6 mg/m3 (11 ppm), using the two most current years of data available. A review of the latest available data for Durham County at that time (1982 and 1983) resulted in a design value of 16.7 mg/m*. On September 18,1984, the Governor of the State of North Carolina requested EPA concurrence for the State to revise its SIP for CO, obviating the need for a section 110(a)(2)(H) call by EPA. On October 15,1984, EPA approved the proposed action by the Governor on condition that the State of North Carolina commit to completing its SIP revision within one year. A proposed schedule was submitted within 60 days of EPA's concurrence, detailing how this would be accomplished. Emission Inventory There are two primary sources of carbon monoxide emissions in the Durham area, stationary sources and mobile sources. A 1983 stationary source inventory was compiled by the NCDEM using the national emissions data system for area sources and the permitting/reporting system used for major combustion sources. Eleven stationary CO source categories were analyzed and summed, resulting in stationary source emissions of 3,310 tons/year. County-wide emissions from mobile sources were also developedusing vehicle miles of travel (VMT), by speed class, and MOBILE-3, EPA's mobile source emission model. Mobile source emissions for base year 1983 were calculated to be 43,280 tons/year, or 93% of the CO emissions which occurred in Durham County. Level of Control Required The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for CO are 35 parts per million (ppm) or 40 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3) for one hour and 9 ppm or 10mg/m3 over eight hours, not to be exceeded more than once per year. There have been no monitored exceedances of the one-hour CO standard in Durham County. However, there have been numerous eight-hour exceedances resulting in a design value, i.e., highest second high CO concentration, of 16.7 mg/m3. Detailed analysis of the monitored violations, including modelling and traffic data analysis, indicates an areawide problem in the central business district (CBD) of Durham. A \"rollback technique\" was therefore used to calculate the required CO reduction. This technique involves linearly rolling back the design value to the standard and reducing emissions by the percentage difference. Since 1984 design value for Durham County is 16.7 mg/m3, a 43% reduction in emissions is required by December 31,1987, to attain the 10 mg/m3 eight-hour CO NAAQS. Attainment Demonstration The State and local Departments of Transportation developed detailed 1984 VMT data for the Durham CBD and projected this base data to 1987. Using approrpiate emission factors from MOBILE-3, as 1984 and 1987 emissions inventory was developed for the Durham CBD. A comparison of the 1984 to the 1987 mobile source emissions inventory for the Durham CBD shows a reduction in CO emissions of 56.4%, considerably more than the required 43%. The primary reasons for these reductions are the Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP) and various transportation control measures that impact the CBD. The TCMs include the incorporation of a computerized traffic signal system and the completion of the Fayetteville-Elizabeth connector. The implementation of tese TCMs accounts for the increased travel speeds in the CBD. Furthermore, traffic in the downtown area has been declining during the past five years, resulting in decreased CBD VMT. This trend has now reversed, but only a modest one to Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules29395 two percent growth rate is projected for the next three to four years. Intersection Hot Spot Analysis Ambient monitoring data for CO is currently available at one intersection in Durham County. The Roxboro Road monitoring site was established in Durham on Duke Street near the intersection of Roxboro Road as a middle scale site. The site was operational in October, 1982, but was shut down in April, 1984, due to consistently low values. Therefore, evaluation of both current and projected air quality was made using approrpiate modeling techniques. A general screening process was used to rank the most congested intersections in the County. The Durham Traffic Engineering Division formulated a list of fifteen intersections in and around Durham. This list included the most likely candidates for high CO concentrations, based on the volume of traffic and the amount of associated congestion. TEXIN, a model developed by the Chemical Engineering Department and the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A & M University, was then used to rank all fifteen intersections. The five intersections expected to have the worst air quality impacts at the end of 1987 were subjected to more detailed analysis. A CO dispersion model refered to as CAL3Q was used. This model takes into account the emissions from queued vehicles that take place at signalized intersections, ft is a modfication of the CALINE-3 model developed by the State of California. EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards recommended the use of this model. The only emission controls accounted for were those associated with the FMVCP. The worst of these intersections is projected to have a maximum eight-hour concentration of 8.1 ppm, well below the 9 ppm, eight hour standard. Because of EPA's close involvement in the detailed analysis work and throughout this process, the technical appendices prepared by the NCDEM w ill serve as the technical support document for this approval action. P roposed A ction : Based on the above discussion, EPA is proposing the approval of the post-1982 North Carolina CO SIP revision for Durham County. The plan revision satisfactorily meets all Part D requirements of the Clean Air Act. Since the State of North Carolina is not required to revise their CO control strategy or change their rules or regulations to assure attainment of the C O NAAQS in Durham County, there isno material to be incorporated by reference. The Agency views this proposal as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. The public is invited to participate in this rulemaking by submitting written comments on the proposed action. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. (See 46 FR 8709.) \u00a1The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission instituted this proceeding by Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\"Proposed Rule\") published in the Federal Register on April 13,1987 (52 FR 11832), to address apparent conditions unfavorable to shipping in the United States/Peru trade (\"the Trade\") pursuant to section 19(l)(b) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, 46 U.S.C. app. 876(l)(b). Comments on the Proposed Rule were originally due on May 13,1987. However, by Notice of May 11,1987 (\"May Notice\") (52 FR 18408), this period was extended until July 3, i\u00a7\u00a37. In its May Notice, the Commission noted that a Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\"), signed on May 1,1987 between the Governments of Peru and the United States, appeared to be a significant development which may be expected to affect access of non- Peruvian-flag carriers to the Trade. Accordingly, the Commission extended the comment period in order to obtain the views of interested persons on this development. The Commission has granted two further extensions of time for commenting on the Proposed Rule due to the delay in the promulgation of the Peruvian regulations to implement the MOU. Comments are presently due on August 10,1987.The Government of Peru has now issued its regulations implementing the MOU. These regulations, Peruvian Ministerial Resolution No. 027-87-TC/ AC (\"Resolution\"), were signed on July 27,1987. Commision staff has translated the regulations from Spanish into English. This informal translation is available to interested persons in the Commission's Office of the Secretary. Interested parties are invited to comment on this Resolution in connection with any comments submitted on the Proposed Rule by August 10,1987. By the Commission. Joseph C.

The full text of this Commission decision is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Dockets Branch (Room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this decision may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor,International Transcription Service, (202) 857-3800, 21 M Street, NW., Suite 140, Washington, DC 20037. Summary of Notice of Proposed Rule Making The FCC has proposed to modify the rules in the General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) to better accommodate recent developments in personal use and changes in technology. To this end, the FCC has proposed to limit eligibility for G^IRS system licensing only to individuals. Systems licensed to non\u00ad individuals before the release date of this proposal would be grandfathered. To facilitate transient use of repeaters, the FCC proposed to permit use of a GMRS system's repeater by any other GMRS licensees or family members the licensee permits. The FCC also proposed to allow a GMRS station operator to be any other GMRS licensee or family member for whom the licensee is willing to take responsibility. To permit more efficient and effective use of the GM RS spectrum, rules were proposed to permit each GM RS licensee to select the channel or channel pair for the stations in a GM RS system as needed (with some limitations near the Canadian border). Only one channel or channel pair could be used at a given time by any station. To accommodate personal GMRS users with mobile equipment who have only occasional need for base station communications, the FCC proposed to create a small base station using the same regulatory approach as the GMRS small control station. A small base station would employ no more than five watts effective radiated power and would employ an antenna no more than twenty feet above the ground or above the building or tree on which it is mounted. Small base stations would be allowed the same frequency tolerance as mobile stations. Seven interstitial frequencies would be added as channels in the GMRS. The three 462 MHz interstitial channels would be solely for mobile station and small base station use. The four 467 MHz interstitial channels would be restricted to non-voice communications solely for the purpose of repeater control, and limited to five watts maximum effective radiated power. As part of its continuing regulatory review the FCC also proposed: (1) To make certain changes to the GMRS rules to conform to new Field Operations Bureau Classification of certain field offices; (2) to remove advisory rules recommending that GMRS radios be repaired only by technicians approved by some organization with the Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules 29397 consensus of GMRS users, because there is no such organization in this service; and (3) to update the FCC addresses for filing GMRS applications. This is a non-restricted notice and comment rule making proceeding. S e e \u00a7 1.1231 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 1.1231, for rules governing permissible ex p a rte contacts. Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 605, it is certified that the proposed rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial member of small entities. Although these proposed changes allow the personal radio community greater flexibility and convenience, they will not cause a significant economic impact on small entities. The proposal contained herein has been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and found to decrease the information collection burden which the Commission imposes on the public. This proposed reduction in information collection burden is subject to approval by the Office of Management and Budget as prescribed by the Act. Pursuant to applicable procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 1.415 and 1.419, interested parties may file comments on or before December 31, 1987. All relevant and timely comments will be considered by the Commission before final action is taken in this proceeding. The proposed amendments to the Commission's rules are issued under the authority contained in sections 4(i) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303{r).

Comments are invited. This action is necessary for enforcement purposes andto reconcile certain inconsistencies between Federal and State groundfish regulations. It is intended to improve coordination between Federal and State management jurisdictions and to strengthen enforcement of domestic groundfish regulations. d a t e : Comments on this proposed rule are invited until September 8,1987. ADDRESSES: Comments on this proposed rule may be submitted to Rolland A.

Charles Fullerton, 213-514-6196. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson Act), the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP) was prepared by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) and approved by the Secretary of Commerce (Secretary) on January 4, 1982. The FMP has been amended two times, and the implementing regulations governing domestic fishing are codified at 50 CFR Part 663. This action would change the Federal groundfish regulations to facilitate enforcement and resolve inconsistencies between Federal and State regulations. The proposed regulatory changes were discussed and recommended to the Secretary by the Council at its September 1986 meeting. The proposed changes are described below. Similar changes have been proposed for the Fishery Management Plan for Commercial and Recreational Salmon Fisheries off the Coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California (52 FR 19774; May 27,1987). Issu Under 16 U.S.C. 1861(b), authorized officers are empowered to conduct inspection of a fishing vessel in connection with enforcement of the Magnuson Act with or without a warrant, and to exercise any other lawful authority, The Federal groundfish regulations make it unlawful to refuse to permit an authorized officer to board a fishing vessel subject to a person's control for purposes of conducting any search or inspection in connection with the enforcement of the Magnuson Act or its implementing regulations. The proposed rule would broaden this prohibition to clarify the Federal Register / V ol, 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules29401 authority of authorized officers to enter buildings, vehicles, piers, or dock- facilities where groundfish may be found by making it unlawful for a person in control to refuse such entry. Th\u00e9 proposed regulation is identical to one approved in Lovgren v. Byrne, 787 F.2d 857 (3rd Cir. 1986), in which the court found that the regulatory provision was necessary for enforcement of the Magnuson Act, and that entry into dockside facilities by authorized officers without a warrant was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Broadening of the existing groundfish regulation to include dock and transport areas also comports with the requirements of the Magnuson Act, does not unnecessarily intrude on reasonable privacy interests of those in industry, and furthers the strong Federal interest in protecting natural resources in U.S. waters. By adding a definition of \"areas of custody,\" the scope of inspection is limited to only those times when and those places where groundfish may be found. Issue 2 \u2014F a lse statem ents. 18 U.S.C. 1001 makes it a criminal offense punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 or five years' imprisonment, or both, to make false statements concerning any matter under the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States. Current Federal groundfish regulations do riot contain a similar provision although violators would be subject to Federal criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Inclusion of such provision will promote effective enforcement of the groundfish regulations, and will make false statements subject to the civil penalty and forfeiture sanctions of the Magnuson Act, which in most cases are sufficient remedies for violations in lieu of criminal prosecution. The proposed rule would prohibit making any false statement, oral or written, to an authorized officer about the taking, catching, harvesting, possession, landing, purchase, sale, or transfer of groundfish. Identical provisions appear in other regional fisheries regulations promulgated under the Magnuson Act. Issue d\u2014 G ear inspection. The cutting or freeing of gear by fishermen while fishing to prevent inspection by authorized officers is not specifically prohibited by the Federal groundfish regulations. The proposed rule would make it unlawful to refuse to submitfishing gear under a person's control to inspection by an authorized officer or to interfere with or prevent, by any means, such an inspection. The rule is necessary to ensure that authorized officers have the ability to enforce gear restrictions. Similar provisions appear in other regional fisheries regulations promulgated under the Magnuson Act, and in State fisheries regulations. Classification The proposed rule is published under authority of section 305(g) of the Magnuson Act, as amended by Pub. L. 99-659. The Administrator, before publishing a final rule, will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment period This action is not expected to alter the nature or intensity of environmental impacts which were addressed in the supplemental environmental impact statement (SEIS) prepared by the Council for the FMP or in the environmental assessments for the two amendments to the FMP. Notices of availability of the SEIS and environmental assessments were published on February 12,1982,47 FR 6483; March FR 39766; respectively. The Administrator of NOAA has determined that this proposed rule is not a \"major rule\" requiring a regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12291. The proposed changes to the regulatory text will not impose any direct costs on industry and will not affect competition, employment, investment, productivity or innovation. While no costs are expected from the action, benefits will occur from more effective regulations through enhanced enforcement and a reduction in administrative costs. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that this proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This is because the measures to be implemented are technical in nature and serve to clarify the intent and scope of existing legal authorities. As a result, these measures are not expected to alter fishing practices or impose costs on the industry. This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction ActThe Administrator has determined that this rule does not directly affe\u00e7t the coastal zone of any State with an approved coastal zone management program.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 10,1987, the E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., Inc., of Wilmington, Delaware, submitted to the Animal andPlant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) a protocol for the field testing of genetically engineered herbicide resistant tobacco plants in Newcastle County, Delaware. The genetically engineered tobacco plants were altered by the addition of a single gene from a noncommercial variety of tobacco, for the purpose of making the plants resistant to a sulfonylurea herbicide. The field testing is designed to evaluate the performance of the tobacco plants against the herbicide. The Federal Plant Pest Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 150aa through 150jj), and regulations issued thereunder, requires APHIS to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests in the United States. Pursuant to the request of E. I. DuPont de Nemours & Co., Inc., APHIS has reviewed the DuPont protocol to determine the plant pest risk of the genetically altered tobacco plants. APHIS has determined that the proposed field trial of the genetically engineered tobacco plants does not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination. The APHIS determination is not in the form of a \"permit,\" but rather is an opinion letter which concludes that the genetically altered tobacco plants do not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination. The basis for this determination was as follows: 1. The plasmid of A g ro b a G teriu m tu m e fa c ie n s used to infect and transform the subject tobacco plants was biologically \"disarmed\" and that transformed tobacco cells were treated with an antibiotic to rid them of A. tu m e fa c ie n s . Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that the plasmid used to transfer to the tobacco plants the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene and the antibiotic marker would be able to incite disease in the recipient plant or to escape and infect other plants in the environment. 2. Both the Kanamycin (antibiotic marker) and sulfonylurea (herbicide) resistance genes have been stably incorporated into the genome of the recipient tobacco plants. The risk of horizontal movement of these genetic traits from the experimental tobacco plants into the genetic environment is negligible because of their stable incorporation and the complete lack of a suitable mechanism to vector the genetic material.Federal Register Vol. 52, No. 152 Friday, August 7, 1987 3. The donor organism used to supply the herbicide resistant ALS gene was another noncommercial variety of tobacco. D uring the approximately 300 year history of the cultivation of tobacco, it has never exhibited any plant pest characteristics such as weediness. The other gene, Kanamycin resistance, which is also involved in the transformation of the tobacco, has no inherent plant pest characteristics, and functions only as a genetic marker in the initial cell selection process following transformation. Therefore, it poses no plant pest risk. 4. It appears that the subject plants will grow in such a way that there will be no significant risk of plant material from the field testing surviving in the environment beyond the termination of the experiment, or becoming mixed with the genetic material of other tobacco populations outside of the test site at the Newcastle County, Delaware, facility.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 20,1987, the Northrup King Company, Stanton, Minnesota, submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) a protocol for the field testing of genetically engineered herbicide resistant tobacco plants in Scotland County, North Carolina. The genetically engineered tobacco plants were altered by the addition of a single gene from a noncommercial variety of tobacco, for the purpose of making the plants resistant to a sulfonylurea herbicide.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 24,1987, the Monsanto Company of St. Louis, Missouri, submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) a protocol for the field testing of genetically engineered disease resistant tomato plants in Jersey County, Illinois. The genetically engineered tomato plants were altered by the addition of a single gene, coat protein (CP), from the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) for the purpose of making the plants resistant to TMV. The field testing is designed to evaluate the performance of the tomato plants against TMV under field conditions. The Federal Plant Pest Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 150aa through 150jj), and regulations issued thereunder, requires APHIS to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests in the United States. Pursuant to the Monsanto Company request, APHIS has reviewed the Monsanto protocol to determine the plant pest risk of the proposed field trial of genetically engineered tomato plants. APHIS has determined that the proposed field trial of the genetically engineered tomato plants does not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination. The APHIS determination is not in the form of a \"permit,\" but rather is an opinion letter which concludes that the genetically engineered tomato plants do 29404 Federal Register f Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination. The basis for this determination was as follows: 1. The plasmid of A grobacterium tum efaciens used to infect and transform the subject tomato plants was biologically \"disarmed\" and that the transformed tomato cells were treated with an antibiotic to rid them of A . tum efaciens. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that the plasmid used to transfer to the tomato plants the TM V- CP gene and the antibiotic marker would be able to incite disease in the recipient plant or to escape and infect other plants in the environment. 2. Both the Kanamycin (antibiotic marker) and the TMV resistance genes have been stably incorporated into the genome of the recipient tomato plants. The risk of horizontal movement of these genetic traits from the experimental tomato plants into the genetic environment is negligible because of their stable incorporation and the complete lack of a suitable mechanism to vector the genetic material. 3. The donor organism was TMV and the specific gene utilized was that for only the TMV-CP. There is no evidence in the published literature that the TMV-CP gene is responsible for any disease symptoms, infectivity, or damage associated with the TMV, and the construct of the chimeric TMV-CP gene has been published in a reviewed scientific journal. Only 0.1% of the total cellular protein of the transformed tomato plants will be TMV-CP, therefore, the stable incorporation of the TMV-CP gene does not pose a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination. The other gene, Kanamycin resistance, which is also involved in the transformation of the tomato, has no inherent plant pest characteristics, and functions only as a genetic marker in the initial cell selection process following transformation. Therefore, it poses no plant pest risk. 4.

FOR FURTHER INFORM ATION C O N TA C T: Mr. Terry L. Medley, Director, Biotechnology and Environmental Coordination Staff, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Room 406, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, 301-436-7602. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On March 12,1987, the Monsanto Company of St. Louis, Missouri, submitted to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) a protocol for the field testing of genetically engineered herbicide resistant tomato plants in Jersey County, Illinois. The genetically engineered tomato plants were altered by the addition of a single gene, from a Petunia hybridia cell line for the purpose of making the plants resistant to glyphosate herbicide. The field testing is designed to evalaute the performance of the tomato plants against the herbicide under field conditions.The Federal Plant Pest Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 150aa through 150jj), and regulations issued thereunder; requires APHIS to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests in the United States. Pursuant to the Monsanto Company request, APHIS has reviewed the Monsanto protocol to detemine the plant pest risk of the proposed field trial of genetically engineered tomato plants. APHIS has determined that the proposed field trial; of the genetically engineered tomato plants does not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination. The APHIS determination is not in the form of a \"permit,\" but rather is an opinion letter which concludes that the genetically engineered tomato plants do not present a risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination. The basjs for this determination was as follows: 1. The plasmid of A grobacterium tum efaciens used to infect and transform the subject tomato plants was biologically \"disarmed\" and that the transformed tomato Gells were treated with an antibiotic to rid them of A. tum efaciens . Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that the plasmid used to transfer to the tomato plants, the 5- enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosophate synthase (EPSP synthase) gene and the antibiotic marker would be able to incite disease in the recipient plant or to escape and infect other plants in the environment. 2. Both the Kanamycin (antibiotic marker) and the herbicide resistance genes have been stably incorporated into the genome of the recipient tomato plants. The risk of horizontal movement of these genetic traits from the experimental tomato plants into the genetic environment is negligible because of their stable incorporation and the complete lack of a suitable mechanism to vector the genetic material. 3. The donor organism used to supply the herbicide resistance EPSP synthase gene was from a Petunia hybridia c e ll line and the specific gene isolated was that for Only a glyphosate resistant EPSP synthase. There is no evidence in the published literature that the EPSP synthase gene or the donor plant are responsible for any plant disease, plant pest characteristics or damage. The production of EPSP synthase, which catalyzes a step in the shikimate pathway is a normal constituent of plants, and EPSP synthase would be found in a non transformed tomato plant. The level of EPSP synthase in a plant or the specific form of the enzyme (isozyme) have never been implicated in Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices 29405 or contributing to the risk of plant pest introduction or dissemination. The other gene, Kanamycin resistance, which is also involved in the transformation of the tomato, has no inherent plant pest characteristics, and functions only as a genetic marker in the initial cell selection process following transformation. Therefore, it poses no plant pest risk. 4, It appears that the subject plants will grow in such a way that there will be no significant risk of plant material from the field testing surviving in the environment beyond the termination of the experiment, or becoming mixed with the genetic material of other tomato populations outside of the test site at the Jersey County, Illinois, facility. It appears that the combination of the physicial environment and management practices outlined in the protocol, create a nonpropogative environment.

The genetically engineered tomato plants were altered by the addition of a single gene, delta- endotoxin from B acillu s thuringiensis (B.t.), for the purpose of making the plants resistant to insects. The field testing is designed to evaluate the performance of the tomato plants against insects under field conditions. The Federal Plant Pest Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 150aa through 150jj), and regulations issued thereunder, requires APHIS to prevent the introduction and dissemination of plant pests in the United States. Pursuant to the Monsanto Company request, APHIS has reviewed the Monsanto protocol to determine the plant pest risk of the proposed field trial of genetically engineered tomato plants.

The donor organism used to supply the insect resistance gene was B.t, There is no evidence in the published literature that the B.t. delta-endotoxin gene or the donor microbe are responsible for any plant disease, plant pest characteristics, or damage. The use of B.t. as an insecticide, has an EPA approved label, as well as a longstanding record of safety. The amount of B.t. delta- endotoxin present in the tomato plants will be one-sixth the amount normally applied in a single application of the commercially available biological insecticide. The other gene, Kanamycin resistance, which is also involved in the transformation of the tomato, has no inherent plant pest characteristics, and functions only as a genetic marker in the initial cell selection process following transformation. Therefore, it poses no plant pest risk. 4.

ACTIO N : Notice of application by Westmin Resources Limited for a permit to construct, connect, operate and maintain electric transmission facilities at the international border between the United States and Canada. SUMMARY: Westmin Resources Limited (Westmin) has applied to the Economic Regulatory Administration (ERA) for a Presidential permit to construct, connect, operate and maintain electric transmission facilities at the international border between the U.S. and Canada. The proposed transmission facilities will connect two locations in British Columbia and only pass through Alaska. These facilities will not interconnect with any existing U.S. transmission facilities. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION C O N TA C T: Anthony J.

Howe, Department of Energy, Office of General Counsel (GC-41), 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-2900 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 17,1987, Westmin applied to the ERA, pursuant to Executive Order 10485, as amended, for a Presidential permit to construct a 35 kilovolt transmission line which would cross the U.S. international border from British Columbia, Canada, pass through the State of Alaska, and re\u00ad enter British Columbia at a second point on the U.S. international border. This application is contained in Docket No. PP-85. The proposed facilities would be used to transmit electric energy from an existing powerplant located in Stewart, British Columbia, to a new mine to be developed by Westmin in British Columbia, about 10 miles north of Hyder, Alaska. These transmission facilities will not connect with any existing U.S. transmission lines and no electric energy will flow to or from any U.S. electric utility as a result of this project. The proposed line would extend about 11.2 miles through Alaska, with about 2.5 miles constructed underground and about 8.7 miles constructed above ground on wooden poles. All construction in Alaska would be within the right-of-way of the existing Granduc Road. The applicant has indicated that routing of the line through Alaska is required because of inaccessible terrain on the British Columbia side of the border.

August 4,1987. Take notice that on July 27,1987, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco}, P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (TETCO), P.O. Box 2521 Houston, Texas 77252, filed in Docket No. RP87-81-000 a petition pursuant to Rule 207 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR \u00a7 385.207) for a declaratory order declaring that a proposed exchange of gas between Transco and TETCO may be done pursuant to rate schedules on file with the Commission without subjecting either Transco ot TETCO to the open- access provisions of Order No. 436. The petition states that there currently exists an agreement between TETCOP and Transco which provides for the exchange of natural gas by mutual dispatching agreement. Service under the agreement has been certificated under the Natural Gas Act and the agreement is on file as TETCO's Rate Schedule X-14 and Transco's Rate Schedule X-4. TETCO currently renders service to Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., The Brooklyn Union Gas Company and Long Island Lighting Company (New York LDC's), making deliveries of gas to the New York LDC's at TETCO's measuring and regulating station No. 858 into a pipeline jointly owned by the New York LDC's. On May 11,1987, the pipeline was taken out of service for upgrading and will remain out of service until mid-September 1987. TETCO likewise has facilities out-of\u00ad service. Pending the return to service of the facilities, TETCO proposes to make deliveries of gas to the New York LDC's through an exchange of gas with Transco at existing interconnections between their systems, with delivery of the gas by Transco to the New York LDC's through existing delivery points, all pursuant to thepreyiously certificated exchange agreement. In the past, it is stated, Transco had been assisting TETCO in making deliveries to the New York LDC's by accepting deliveries of gas at existing interconnections and transporting the gas pursuant to the open-access provisions of Order No. 436. However, Transco has recently chosen to terminate open-access transportation. The petition states that TETCO believes that Transco can perform the exchange service pursuant to Rate Schedules X-4and X-14 for the benefit of the new York LDC's. However, it is stated, Transco has replied that it believes the rate schedules do not apply to service for the benefits of the New York LDC's and that undertaking transportation pursuant to these rate schedules would subject Transco to the open-access provisions of Order No. 436. Therefore, TETCO has requested that the Commission issue an order declaring that Rate Schedules X-4 and X-14 are operable in the circumstances described above and that operation of the above described certificated exchange agreement between TETCO and Transco will not subject them to the open-access provisions of Order No. 436. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should on or before August 19, 1987, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211).

EC2, Devers-Palo Verde No. 2, 500 kV Transmission Line Project, Construction and Operation, Right-of-Way Grant, Additional Alternatives, CA and AZ. Summary: EPA expressed environmental concerns because the draft supplemental EIS did not demonstrate the project's compliance with the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines of the Clean Water Act, which regulate the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S., including riparian areas and desert washes that could be impacted by project features. ERP No. D-FHW -E40706-GA, Rating EC2, Mansell Rd./GA-400 Interchange Extension, Mansell Rd./Old Roswell Rd. Intersection to Old Alabama Rd./Turner Rd., 404 Permit, GA. Sum m ary: EPA's concerns were the lack of a Wetlands Mitigation Plan, design year Level of Service values (air quality), detailed analysis of only one build alternative, and noise impacts. As a result, more information was requested in these areas and additional consideration of noise documentation and abatement EPA also requested that the close consultation with local governments contributing to funding be continued. ERP No. D -SFW -L64036-AK, Rating EC2, Yukon Delta Nat'l Wildlife Refuge, L on g Term M gmt. Plan and Wilderness Review , AK. Sum m ary: EPA's major concern involved the requirement for additional funding and staff levelincreases in order to fully implement the management directives encompassed by each alternative. The draft EIS noted that the funding and staff levels would have to more than double to fully implement any of the four alternatives. EPA suggested that the final EIS discuss the funding process and present contingency plans for implementing each alternative in the event that funding is inadequate. ERP No. D-USA-L11007-W A, Rating EC2, Yakima Firing Center Expansion of Military Training Center, Land Acquisition, Fort Lewis Military Installation, 9th Infantry Division, WA. Sum m ary: The draft EIS identifies, generally, a number of significant environmental resources and ecosystems that will be affected by the proposed training center expansion. However, the EIS does not respond adequately to a number of environmental issues EPA raised during the scoping process. These issues include: Air quality impacts, noise mitigation, water quality impacts, and justification for the need for the two Columbia River crossing sites. Final EISs ERP No. F-A FS-L65098-ID , Challis Nat'l Forest, Resource Mgmt. Plan, ID. Sum m ary: EPA's major concern with the final EIS and Forest Plan is that the interrelationship between major components of the forest management process is not clearly described. Also the level of detail and commitment for monitoring was not commensurate with the sensitivity of the resources in the Forest nor the inadequacy of the existing data base. ERP N o. F-FHW -D40213-DE, US-13 Relief Route Construction, DE-7 to US 113/US 13, 404 Permit, DE. Sum m ary: EPA's review found that the final EIS satisfactorily addressed earlier concerns regarding the draft EIS. However, EPA is concerned about the lack of clarity in some sections of the final EIS and recommends their modification. ERP No. FS-FH W -E40150-FL, Port Everglades Express way/I-595 Construction, I-95/FL-736/Davie Blvd. Improvement, S. Fork New River to Broward Blvd., FL Sum m ary: EPA was primarily concerned that the final supplemental EIS did not indicate whether the proposed project was considered in an area wide hydrocarbon burden analysis as the project area is in a nonattainment for ozone area. Although this and other air quality concerns were orally resolved, follpw-up documentation was requested. EPA also requested follow-up regardipg noise impacts, the need for a clearercommitment for noise abatement, and planned additional noise studies.

EPA's Regional Administrator, Region II, has reason to believe that the unauthorized discharge of fill and the proposed discharge of fill into wetlands by the Russo Development Corporation\u201471 Hudson Street, Hackensack, New Jersey\u2014within the Hackensack Meadowlands in Carlstadt, New Jersey for the purpose of building warehouses may have unacceptable adverse effects on wildlife. Accordingly, this notice announces the Regional Administrator's proposed determination to prohibit or restrict the discharge of dredged or fill material at the site and seeks public comment on his proposal. Public Hearing EPA will schedule a public hearing if there is a significant degree of public interest, or if Russo Development Corp., as landowner and permit applicant, requests one. If a public hearing is scheduled, public notice of a hearing will be issued and will contain: (1) Reference to this public notice of the proposed determination, (2) the date, time, and place of the hearing and, (3) a brief description of the nature and purpose of the hearing including the rules and procedures. The public hearing would be scheduled no earlier than 21 days from the date of this notice of proposed determination.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Description of the Section 404(c) Process The Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1251 e t seq ., prohibits the discharge of pollutants, including dredged anti fill material, into the waters of the United States (including wetlands) except in compliance with, among other things, section 404, 33 U.S.C. 1344. Section 404 authorizes the Secretary of Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, to authorize the discharge of dredged or fill material at specified sites through the application of environmental guidelines developed by EPA in conjunction with the Secretary or where warranted by the economics of anchorage and navigation, except as provided in section 404(c). Section 404(c) authorizes the Administrator of EPA, after notice and opportunity for hearing, to prohibit or restrict the use of a defined site for disposal of dredged or fill material where he determines that such use would have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas (including spawning and breeding areas), wildlife or recreational areas. Regulations published in 40 CFR Part 231 establish the procedures to be followed by EPA in exercising its section 404(c) authority. Whenever the Regional Administrator has reason to believe that use of a site may have an unacceptable adverse effect on the pertinent resources, he may begin the process by notifying the Corps of Engineers and the applicant that he intends to issue a proposed determination under section 404(c). Unless the applicant or the Corps persuades the Regional Administrator that there will not be unacceptable adverse impacts or identifies corrective measures satisfactory to the Regional Administrator within 15 days, the Regional Administrator publishes a notice in the Federal Register of his proposed determination, soliciting public comment and offering an opportunity for a public hearing. Today's notice represents this step in the process. Following the public hearing and the close of the comment period, the Regional Administrator decides whether to withdraw his proposed determinationor prepare a recommended determination. If he prepares a recommended determination, he then forwards it and the complete administrative record compiled in the Region to the Assistant Administrator for Water at EPA's headquarters for a final decision affirming, modifying, or rescinding the recommended determination. The Corps of Engineers and the applicant are provided with another opportunity for consultation before this final decision is made. It is important to note that this section 404(c) action is being initiated in response to art after-the-fact permit action by the Corps pursuant to 33 CFR 326.3(e) and, therefore, primarily involves existing unauthorized fill. EPA may follow up this section 404(c) action with an enforcement action with respect to the unauthorized fill. II. Description of the Site A. R u sso S ite Prior to filling in 1981, the Russo site was characterized by 57.5 acres of palustrine emergent marsh, dominated by common reed [P hragm ites au stralis ) and blue joint grass ( C alam agrostis can a d en sis ). Groupings of aspen [Populus trem u loides ) and ephemeral ponds were interspersed within the tract. The site is situated within a larger palustrine emergent marsh along the Hackensack River commonly referred to as the Empire tract of the Hackensack Meadowlands. This tract was cut off from tidal river flow by dikes placed in the 1920's. The Russo site receives upland drainage and storm water runoff from adjacent areas and transfers this drainage via ditches dredged on site in the 1920's to Moonachie Creek which drains to the Hackensack River. Moonachie Creek has had a tide gate at its confluence with the Hackensack River since the 1920's. Historically the site has impounded large areas of water. For example, during construction of the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike from 1969 to 1971 ditches within the Empire Tract were filled with fill material and drainage was blocked. The Empire tract including the Russo site became an impoundment area with standing water. When turnpike construction was finished in 1971 the drainage ditches were re-dredged. No further maintenance of these ditches or those on the Russo site has occurred since then. In addition, severe storm events in conjunction with the inadequate drainage provided by unmaintained ditches on the Russo site have resulted in storm water retention and 29432 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices impoundment related to storm water back-up upstream of the Moonachie Creek tide gate. Between 1981 and 1985 the Russo Development Corporation discharged 52.5 acres of fill material, shot rock (a fill mixture of clean dirt and rock) from excavation sites in New York, on the site without Department of the Army authorization. Six warehouses were constructed on 44 of the 52.5 acres of fill and are currently tenanted; 8.5 acres of fill remain undeveloped. The remaining five acres of wetland on site which did not receive fill have developed into a freshwater pond edged by cattail [T ypha sp.) and common reed. The Russo Development Corporation has sought after-the-fact Department of the Army authorization to maintain the 52.5 acres of fill and authorization to discharge fill material into the remaining 5 wetland acres for the purpose of constructing more warehouses. The Russo site was/ and remains wetlands and waters of the United States pursuant to 33 CFR 328.3 and 40 CFR 230.3. The site therefore is subject to regulations under section 404 of the Clean Water Act and a Department of the Army 404 permit is required to discharge fill onto the site. This permit issuance must be in compliance with the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines. Currently, muskrat, waterfowl and a variety of rodents have been observed on the remaining five wetland acres on site. Historical accounts of wildlife use, prior to or at the time of discharge of 52.5 acres of fill, list grey fox (occasional), rabbit, pheasant, waterfowl, woodcock, killdeer and, marsh-associated songbirds. In addition, waterfowl utilization was high when the Russo site impounded large areas of water. Prior to discharge of fill the site functioned in sediment and toxicant retention, contributing to water purification. After discharge of fill, 52.5 acres of the site was transformed from a reed, blue-joint grass and interspersed emergent vegetative community into an upland industrial building complex. The discharge of fill resulted in a higher site elevation, a complete change in substrate and hydrology with the consequent loss of occasional open water impoundment, the loss of ephemeral ponds, the loss of wetland vegetation and animal communities associated with wetland habitat and the loss of sediment and toxicant retention capacities. B. T he H a ck en sa ck M eadow lan ds D istrict The Russo site is part of the Hackensack Meadowlands ecosystem. The 7,000-8,000 acres of wetlandscontained therein provide habitat for many species of waterfowl, wading birds, shorebirds, passerines, raptors, and various mammals, reptiles and amphibians. While the Meadowlands perform critical environmental functions, they are under intense development pressure. In fact, the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission (HMDC) reports that the wetlands acreage in the Meadowlands District decreased from 10,521 to 7,800 acres between 1972 and 1984. The HMDC Master Zoning Plan provides for development of approximately an additional 2,200 acres of wetlands. Because of the concern that development in the wetlands and flood- plain areas of the Meadowlands would conflict with section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958, and other federal policies, EPA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) presented recommendations to the Corps of Engineers in 1981 concerning potential permit reviews. In particular, EPA and FWS divided the Meadowlands into marginal and critical wetlands categories. The Agencies anticipated that permits could be granted for \"marginal wetlands\", provided adequate compensation and other appropriate permit conditions were imposed. The Russo site was designated in this category. For \"critical, high quality, and extremely productive wetlands,\" EPA and FWS indicated that they would be likely to recommend permit denial. If a permit were issued, compensation of at least two wetland acres for every acre lost would be necessary. While the 1981 policy reflected an initial effort to distinguish among wetlands, it was based on a preliminary and limited data base. Consequently, EPA in late 1985 initiated an Advanced Identification study within the Hackensack Meadowlands with the support of other federal and state agencies. The study is evaluating wetland values, as well as impacts of the intense development pressures to these wetlands, in much greater detail. It is EPA's expectation that the results of the study will serve as a template for future section 404 permit decisions in the Meadowlands. During this time frame, HMDC will also be revising its Master Plan for a number of reasons, including the fact that the Master Plan has not been subject to review for consistency with the National Environmental Policy Act and section 404 of the Clean Water Act.III. Proceedings to D ate For the reasons stated earlier, a Department of the Army permit is required to discharge fill onto the Russo site. The Russo Development Corporation has sought an after-the-fact Department of the Army permit for the existing and proposed work previously described. The Corps of Engineers issued Public Notice 12360-85690-Jl for this application on August 28,1985 proposing to maintain the 52.5 acres of unauthorized fill, to authorize 5 further acres of fill for the purpose of constructing warehouses and to require mitigation for the entire 57.5 acres. The Corps has approved Russo Development Corp.'s mitigation proposal which includes enhancement of existing wetlands within the Hackensack Meadowlands to provide a 0.5:1 (enhancedost) value-for-value compensation for the wetlands lost and a deed restriction securing permanent preservation of 23 wetland acres owned by the applicant in Troy Meadows of the Passaic River basin (i.e., outside of the Hackensack River basin). The Corps advised EPA of its intention to issue the permit as requested by the Russo Development Corporation with the mitigation discussed above. EPA Region II reiterated previously expressed objections to the project and requested 2:1 complete and appropriate mitigation to replace the functions and values provided by all 57.5 acres. EPA did not seek removal of the warehouses on the 44 acres that had been illegally filled, since restoration was unlikely to return the site to its previous wetland state. EPA sought to resolve its concerns through procedures established by the federal agencies under section 404(q) of the Act (see the 404{q) Memorandum of Agreement, November 1985). Section 404(q) directs the Corps and EPA to enter into an agreement to coordinate and expedite permit decision making. In October 1986 correspondence, the Regional Administrator requested notification of the Corps of Engineers permit decision on the Russo application in accordance with these procedures. Accordingly, on December 22,1986 the Corps submitted a preliminary Notice of Intent to Issue (Nil) a permit to EPA and other federal agencies. In response (December 24,1986), the Regional Administrator requested a meeting with the Division Engineer and suspension of further actions on the permit application. Following their January, 1987 meeting, the New York District Corps reexamined the preliminary Nil \\I Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices 29433 and submitted a final Nil maintaining the Corps decision to issue a permit without the mitigation EPA considered necessary. In April 20,1987 correspondence the Assistant Administrator for Water, requested that the Assistant Secretary of the Army (Civil Works) refer the New York District Corps decision to a higher level for re-evaluation. The Assistant Secretary denied EPA's request. Having exhausted these procedures for resolution of EPA's concerns, the Regional Administrator initiated section 404(c) procedures through which the EPA Administrator may exercise a veto over the specification by the Corps of Engineers of a site for the discharge of dredged or fill material. The Regional Administrator notified the District Engineer and the Russo Development Corp. (May 26,1987) of his intent to issue a Public Notice on his proposed section 404(c) determination and notified each that there would be a 15 day consultation period to resolve his concern regarding the significant adverse effects. The Corps and the Russo Development Corp. responded (May 27,1987 and June 10,1987 respectively) concluding that the project did not pose any unacceptable adverse effects. The consultation period closed on June 11,1987. Following a review of responses received from the Corps and the applicant, the Regional Administrator concluded that no new information had been provided and, therefore, he was not persuaded that there would be no unacceptable adverse effects from the existing and proposed fill. IV. Basis for Proposed Determination A. S ection 404(c) C riteria The Clean Water Act requires that exercise of the final section 404(c) authority be based on a determination of \"unacceptable adverse effect\" on municipal water supplies, shellfish beds, fisheries, wildlife or recreational areas. The regulations define unacceptable adverse effect: Impact on an aquatic or wetland ecosystem which is likely to result in significant degradation of municipal water supplies or significant loss of or damage to fisheries, shellfishing, or wildlife habitat or recreation areas. In evaluating the unacceptability of such impacts, consideration should be given to the relevant portions of the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines (40 CFR Part 230). (40 CFR 231.2 (e)) The preamble to the 404(c) regulations explains that one of the basic functions of section 404(c) is to police the application of the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines.Those portions of the guidelines relating to significant degradation of waters of the U.S. (40 CFR 230.10(c)), to minimizing adverse impacts to aquatic resources (40 CFR 230.10(d)) and to the determination of cumulative effects on the aquatic ecosystem (40 CFR 230.11(g)) are of particular importance to evaluating the unacceptability of environmental impacts in this case. Compliance with the Guidelines requires that no discharge of dredged or fill material shall be permitted if it causes or contributes to significant degradation of waters of the U.S. Effects contributing to significant degradation include but are not limited to the loss of wildlife habitat or the loss of a wetland's capacity to assimilate nutrients. Compliance with the guidelines requires that no discharge be permitted unless appropriate and practicable steps have been taken to minimize adverse impacts of the discharge on the aquatic ecosystem. In addition, the guidelines state that the permitting authority should collect and solicit information concerning cumulative impacts and document and consider this information during the decision-making process. Thus, it is appropriate under section 404(c) to take into account whether the project has or will result in significant degradation to aquatic resources, particularly wildlife habitat, or whether the proposed mitigation is adequate to offset the impacts of the Russo project. B. Im pacts to F illin g th e R u sso S ite As discussed previously, the existing and proposed fill has/will replace the wetland soils, vegetation and hydrology with impervious surface resulting in a loss of the site's sediment and toxicant retention capabilities. In addition, the existing and proposed fill is and will be a source of pollutants to adjacent aquatic areas during rainfall events. Beyond these general but very significant environmental impacts, EPA believes wildlife has and will be significantly affected by the fill at the Russo site. Historical accounts of wildlife use prior to or at the time discharge of the fill list wetland- associated songbirds and waterfowl, woodcock, killdeer, pheasant, rabbit and, occasional grey fox. Loss of 52.5 acres of habitat is likely to have disturbed at least the marsh-related species, particularly in view of development north and west of the project site also encroaching on wildlife habitat. FWS and the Corps have characterized the 52.5 acres of the Russo site as low to moderate habitat prior to its being filled. FWS has explained that this rating is based upon the lack of diversity of wildlife habitat because ofthe monotypic vegetative cover. In addition, FWS noted, and EPA agrees, that the site provided the wildlife habitat functions of a Meadowlands wetland and supported wetland- associated wildlife even though the habitat was monotypic. Moreover, FWS considers the five acres Russo seeks to fill to be a good quality wetland. The five remaining acres which have not yet been filled consist of a 3 acre pond and 2 acres of palustrine emergent marsh with phragmites, cattail, dwarf spikerush, and juncus spp. This freshwater pond with associated emergent vegetation contributes to the diversity of wetlands within the Meadowlands District and provides quality habitat of food and cover to wetland-associated wildlife, especially waterfowl, wading birds, and muskrat. Loss of the additional five acres can therefore be expected to adversely affect wetland associated wildlife. In addition to the direct loss of the Russo site, there is reason to conclude that there may be more far-reaching repercussions on wildlife values. Because of the extensive past losses of wetlands in the Meadowlands, EPA believes there-is cause to conclude that the past and future fill of the Russo site is likely to contribute to cumulative adverse impacts on wildlife. As mentioned above, gradual and continual wetland development has diminished the Meadowlands District's wetlands by 2,721 acres (10,521 to 7,800) and, the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission's Master Plan provides for the development of an approximate additional 2,200 acres. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has designated wetland areas within the eastern flyway, a category into which the Hackensack Meadowlands falls, as priority areas in their Waterfowl Management Plan (May 1986). The Service reports that the degradation of migration and wintering habitat have contributed to long-term downward trends in some duck populations. In those periods when the Russo site impounded large areas of water, waterfowl were numerous on the site. In addition, population declines would be expected for those less mobile wetland- associated species such as muskrat and other rodents, reptiles and amphibians. Ecological theory suggests that disturbed animal populations do not necessarily simply shift into remaining habitat. Depending on the habitat's carrying capacity disturbed populations may perish or displace other organisms which may perish. There is not a great deal of existing information in the record identifying the 29434 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices specific values and functions provided by the formerly existing wetlands. For that reason EPA strongly encourages the public to submit any relevant information. EPA believes, though, that the Meadowlands environment cannot tolerate the loss of the Russo site unless the ecological values the site served/ serves are compensated for. In order for filling of the site to be consistent with the section 404(b)(1) Guidelines, EPA believes adequate mitigation must be provided to assure replacement of the wildlife values and functions, thereby stemming the net loss of wildlife habitat in the Meadowlands.1 Wetland enhancement and creation to provide complete compensation for wetland values lost would constitute appropriate mitigation in this case. It appears, however, that adequate mitigation will not be provided. Russo has offered only to compensate on a 0.5:1 value-for-value basis by enhancing existing wetlands within the Meadowlands District and to place a deed restriction on 23 acres of wetlands it owns outside the District. The information provided to date on the proposed mitigation does not identify a particular site and is too limited to evaluate the anticipated ecological gains and the probability of success. Thus, contrary to EPA's and FWS's consistent comments that 1:1 to 2:1 value-for-value compensation is necessary to prevent net loss of wetland values and functions, the proposed mitigation is unlikely to accomplish that goal. Moreover, the deed restriction affords only questionable environmental benefit since the wetland site would already be protected from significant degradation under section 404 in the event that the discharge of fill were proposed. 1 Since EPA's first response to the Corp's Public Notice of Russo's application for a .permit \u00a1in September, 1985. EPA has consistently stated that mitigation to replace wetland functions and values is required. However, in the fall of 1986, EPA questioned not only the adequacy of Russo's mitigation proposal but also whether there were not, in fact, practicable alternatives to using the Russo site for constructing warehouses. EPA has taken the position that mitigation cannot be used to compensate for avoidable losses; Le., where there are practicable alternatives to filling a wetland site. Consequently, EPA suggested that (1) mitigation providing value-for-value replacement be required for the 44 acres that have been filled and contain warehouses, (2) restoration be required for the B.S acres that have been filled but contain no warehouses and, (3) that a permit be denied to fill the remaining 5 wetland acres: However, assessing the existence of practicable alternatives in the context of an after-the-fact permit raises particularly difficult analytical issues that go far beyond those raised in this particular permit application. Consequently, I have decided not to pursue the practicable alternatives issues in this section 404(c) action.EPA consequently has concluded that the loss of 57.5 acres of wetlands, taken in the context of the cumulative loss of wetland acreage occurring in the Hackensack Meadowlands, could result in signficant loss and damage to wildlife habitat areas. Unless and until the Russo Corporation agrees to provide adequate mitigation as described above, it is EPA's view that an after-the-fact permit for 52.5 acres and a pre-discharge permit for five acres could result in unacceptable adverse impacts to wildlife within the meaning of section 404(c) and 40 CFR 231.2(e). Accordingly, EPA proposes to prohibit the use of the Russo site for discharge of fill material under the conditions reflected in the permit the Corps proposes to issue. Thus, the fill of the five remaining acres of wetlands would be prohibited. In addition, EPA may initiate enforcement action with respect to the unauthorized fill of the 52.5 acres in order to achieve appropriate restoration of or mitigation for the filled area. V. Solicitation of Comments EPA would like to obtain comments on: (1) Whether or not the impacts of such discharge would represent an unacceptable adverse effect as described in section 404(c) of the Clean Water A ct (2) the vegetative and hydrologic characteristics of the subject site and observations of or information concerning wildlife on the site prior to and after the placement of fill material; (3) observations of or information concerning wildlife in wetlands similar to the subject site and in the Hackensack Meadowlands in general; (4) what corrective action, if any, could be taken to reduce the adverse impacts of the discharge; (5) the need for a public hearing and: (6) whether the Regional Administrator should recommend to the Assistant Administrator for Water the determination to prohibit or restrict tlie discharge of dredged or fill material on the site. Comments should be submitted within 60 days of the date of publication of this Federal Register notice to the person listed above under ADDRESSES. All comments received will be fully considered by the Regional Administrator in making his decision to prepare a recommended determination to prohibit or restrict filling of the Russo site or to withdraw this proposed determination.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: a. Background. In March 1985, a request to approve an information collection was submitted to OMB with a proposed revision to the MAS policy statement that was published in the Federal Register for comment. In response, OMB stated that certain material in the statement should be incorporated in the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR), specifically, the Discount Schedule and Marketing Data (DSMD) sheets, the Price Reductions clause, and the Economic Price Adjustment (EPAJ clause. Thus, GSA has developed a change to the GSAR incorporating the DSMD sheets and the Price Reductions clause. Comments received in response to the December 10,1985, and the September 3,1986, Federal Register notices have been incorporated, when appropriate, in this GSAR. GSAR Change 18 issued October 18,1985, incorporated the EPA clause. b. Purpose. The information collections submitted for approval require: (1) Prospective offerors responding to MAS solicitations to submit sales, discount, and marketing data to support pricing judgments in negotiated MAS contracts; (2) the reporting of price reductions to the customer(s) identified as the basis of the award in MAS contracts; and (3) the submitting of pricing data to support an MAS contractor's request for an economic price adjustment in Federal Supply Service MAS contracts. c. A nnual R eporting Burden. Estimated as follows: DSMD sheets, 6,740 respondents and hours; Price Reductions clause, 1,830 respondents and 12,720 hours; Economic Price Adjustment clause, 2,914 respondents and 2,186 hours. d.

This is not a formal request for application. Assistance will be provided only to the Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services for support of this project. No other applications are solicited or will be accepted. A u thority This cooperative agreement is authorized under section 301(a) of the Public Health Services Act (42 U.S.C. 241(a)) as amended. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number is 13.283. Background and Purpose A major emphasis of the CDC Chronic Disease strategic plan is to promote integration of many categorical chronic disease efforts at the local level, as well as coordination of chronic disease prevention activities within CDC. Toward this end, CDC must begin to address the issue of increasing States' capacity to prevent and control the health problems associated with chronic diseases. The proposed project will establish a community-based integrated chronic disease program which can be replicated in other settings to bring about long term reductions in the prevalence of risk factors and chronic disease. The project will be accomplished through mobilization of existing community resources, community diagnosis of chronic disease determinants, and implementation of population specific community interventions. Florida administers several local health departments which are conducting comprehensive chronic disease control programs. These programs include cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cancer, health promotion, health education, and chronic disease epidemiology under one supervisory level within the organization. Florida has integrated chronic disease care activities with primary care under a single funding mechanism. Florida has a chronic disease advisory board which provides advice and assistance and on which allvoluntary agencies are represented. Florida is in a position to conduct extensive evaluation of all chronic disease activities. In addition, Florida has the experience, linkages, and staffing necessary to conduct the project. A vailability of Fu nd s Approximately $183,000 will be available in Fiscal Year 1987 to fund this cooperative agreement. It is expected that the cooperative agreement will begin on or before September 15,1987, and will be funded for a 12-month budget period within a 5-year project period. Continuation awards will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress in meeting project objectives and on the availability of funds.

Whether the proposed plan amendment violates section 402(a)(7) of the Social Security Act, as amended, or 45 CFR 233.20(a)(2)(vi)(b). 2. Whether FSA's decision to reject the proposed plan amendment exceeds its authority under section 402(a)(7) of the Act. 3. Whether the regulatory provision at 45 CFR 233.20(a)(2)(vi)(b) exceeds the plain language of section 402(a)(7) of the Act. 4. Whether the proposed plan amendment violates section 406(b)(2) of the Act and 45 CFR 234.60 of the regulations. 5. Whether the Agency violated its own regulations at 45 CFR 201.3 by failing to act on the proposed plan amendment during die time period prescribed in that regulation and, if so, what effect that alleged violation has on the Agency's authority to reject the amendment. 6. Whether the disapproval of the proposed amendment causes New York to be treated differently from other states that have approved state plans having essential person components and, if so, what effect this disparate treatment has on the Agency's disapproval of the amendment. A copy of this letter will appear as a Notice in the Federal Register and any person wishing to request recognition as a party will be entitled to file a petition pursuant to 45 CFR 213.15(b) with the Departmental Grant Appeals Board within 15 days after that notice has been published.

SUMMARY: The Food and D rug Administration (FDA) has determined the regulatory review period for the Therakos UV A R\u00ae System and is publishing this notice of that determination as required by law. FDA has made the determination because of the submission of an application to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, Department of Commerce, for the extension of a patent which claims that medical device. ADDRESS: Written comments and petitions should be directed to the Dockets Management Branch (HFA- 305), Food and D rug Administration, Rm . 4-62, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, M D 20857. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION C O N TA C T: Philip L. Chao, Office of Health Affairs (HFY-20), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301-443-1382. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Pub. L. 98-417) generally provides that a patent may be extended for a period of up to 5 years so Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / N otices 29441 long as the patented item (human drug product, medical device, food additive, or color additive) was subject to regulatory review by FDA before the item was marketed. Under that act, a product's regulatory review period forms the basis for determining the amount of extension an applicant may receive. A regulatory review period consists of two periods of time; a testing phase and an approval phase. For medical devices, the testing phase begins with a clinical investigation of the device and runs until the approval phase begins. The approval phase starts with the initial submission of an application to market the device and continues until permission to market the device is granted. Although only a portion of a regulatory review period may count toward the actual amount of extension that the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks may award (half the testing phase must be subtracted as well as any time that may have occurred before the patent was issued), FDA's determination of the length of a regulatory review period for a medical device will include all of the testing phase and approval phase as specified in 35 U.S.C. 158(g)(3)(B). FDA recently approved for marketing the medical device product known as the Therakos UVAR\u00ae System which is indicated for use in the ultraviolet-A irradiation, in the presence of the photoactive drug methoxsalen (8- methoxypsoralen, or 8-MOP), of extracorporeally circulating leukocyte- enriched blood in the palliative treatment of the skin manifestations of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in persons enrolled under the notice of claimed investigational exemption for a new drug (IND), IND No. 29,904, who have not been responsive to other forms of treatment. The sale, distribution, and use of this device is limited to investigators participating in IND No. 29,904. Subsequent to this approval, the Patent and Trademark Office received a patent term restoration application for U.S. Patent No. 4,428,744 from Frederic A. Bourke, Jr., Eleanor F. Bourke, Richard L. Edelson, and the Edelson Trust. The Patent and Trademark Office requested FDA's assistance in determining the product's eligibility for patent term restoration, and in a letter dated July 9,1987, FDA advised the Patent and Trademark Office that the medical device had undergone a regulatory review period and that the medical device represented the first permitted commercial marketing or use. This Federal Register notice now represents FDA's determination of the product's regulatory review period.FDA has determined that the applicable regulatory review period for Therakos UVAR\u00ae System is 946 days. Of this time, 589 days occurred during the testing phase of the regulatory review period, while 357 days occurred during the approval phase. These periods of time were derived from the following dates: 1. The d a te a clin ic a l in vestigation involving th is d ev ic e w as begun; September 6,1984. The applicant correctly claims that the investigational device exemption for this device was conditionally approved on January 26,1984. However, FDA regulations at 21 CFR 812.42 explicitly state that an investigation or part of an investigation shall not begin until an institutional review board (IRB) and FDA have both approved \"the application or supplemental application relating to the investigation or part of an investigation.\" Thus, although the IDE was conditionally approved, the investigation could not begin until an IRB approved the investigation. FDA records indicate that IRB approval was obtained on September 6,1984, and, therefore, September 6,1984, is the date on which a clinical investigation could begin. 2. T he d a te an ap p lication w as in itia lly su bm itted with r esp ec t to th e d ev ic e under sectio n 515 o f th e F ed era l F ood, Drug, an d C osm etic A ct: April 17, 1986.

The applicant claims that the device was approved on April 10,1987. However, FDA records indicate that P860003 was approved on April 8,1987. This determination of the regulatory review period establishes the maximum potential length of a patent extension. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office applies several statutory limitations in its calculations of the actual period for patent extension. In its application for patent extension, this applicant seeks 2 years of patent extension. Anyone with knowledge that any of the dates as published is incorrect may, on or before October 6,1987, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments and ask for a redetermination. Furthermore, any interested person may petition FDA, on or before February 3,1988, for a determination regarding whether the applicant for extension acted with due diligence during the regulatory reviewperiod. To meet its burden, the petition must contain sufficient facts to merit an FDA investigation. (See H. Rept. 857, Part 1 ,98th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 41-42, 1984.) Petitions should be in the format specified in 21 CFR 10.30. Comments and petitions should be submitted to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) in three copies (except that individuals may submit single copies) and identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document.

Explanation o f How SSA W ill A pply the D ecision Within the Circuit This ruling applies only to cases where the child resides in a State in the Second Circuit (New York, Connecticut, or Vermont) and the State law treats foster care payments as payments to the foster parent and not assistance payments to the child at the time of the determination or decision at any administrative level of review, i.e., initial, reconsideration, administrative law judge hearing or Appeals Council. In a claim for child's benefits under section 202(d)(8)(D)(ii) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 402(d)(8)(D)(ii)), where the worker was receiving payments as a foster parent for a foster child whom the worker adopted after the worker became entitled to Social Security benefits, the payments are tobe treated as income of the foster parent in determining whether such parent contributed one-half of the adopted foster child's support for purposes of section (d)(8)(D)(ii).

When a claimant seeks to establish her status as the wife or widow of a worker on the basis of the deemed marriage provision and the legal widow was previously entitled, claimant's entitlement will not be barred because the legal widow was previously entitled to wife's, widow's or mother's benefits under section 202 (b), (e) or (g) of the Act.3 This ruling applies equally to claims for husband's, widower's and father's benefits. See footnote 2. In such cases, the application of the deemed spouse will be adjudicated as though the legal spouse had not been entitled, except that the \"deemed spouse\" will not be entitled to wife's, widow's or mother's benefits for any months prior to the month after the month in which the former beneficiary's benefits terminated. Once the applicant has 1 Respectively, the paragraphs of this section set forth the conditions for entitlement for wife's, widow's and mother's insurance benefits. As more fully set forth in the Act, (1) wife's benefits are benefits paid to the wife of a worker who is entitled to benefits either on the basis of her age, or on the basis that she has in her care a child of the worker who is entitled to benefits: (2) widow's benefits are benefits paid to the widow of an insured worker on the basis of her age; and (3) mother's benefits are benefits paid to a widow on the basis that she has in her care a child of the worker who is entitled to benefits. 2 This ruling applies equally to an individual seeking to establish entitlement to husband's, widower's or father's benefits by invoking the provisions of section 216(h)(1) of the Act, where another individual previously has been entitled to husband's, widower's or father's benefits under section 202 (c), (f) or (g), 42 U.S.C. 402 (c), (f) or (g). As more fully set forth in the Act, these categories of benefits are analogous to wife's, widow's and mother's benefits, respectively, as described in footnote 1. * In W o o d s o n , the widow's remarriage was the event which terminated her entitlement to benefits on the worker's account. However, the court's holding is based on the fact that her status as a widow within the meaning of section 216(h)(1)(B) has ended, and would apply equally where the former beneficiary's entitlement had terminated for some other reason. Under the Act and regulations, there are certain situations in which a widow's remarriage does not terminate her entitlement to benefits. See 20 CFR 404.337 and 404.341. The W o o d s o n c a s e does not involve a remarriage which comes within the terms of an exception, and this ruling is not applicable to cases which come within the terms of an exception.

The earliest possible month of entitlement for the deemed spouse would be the month of the former beneficiary's death, or, if applicable, dissolution of the marriage to the insured worker. Therefore, in this situation, both SSA policy and circuit law would permit use of the deemed marriage provision to entitle the deemed spouse. 5 Respectively, the paragraphs of this section set forth the conditions for entitlement for wife's, widow's and mother's insurance benefits. As more fully set forth in the Act, (1) wife's benefits are benefits paid to the wife of a worker who is entitled to benefits either on the basis of her age, or on the basis that she has in her care a child of the worker who is entitled to benefits; (2) widow's benefits are benefits paid to the widow of an insured worker on. the basis of her age; and (3) mother's benefits are benefits paid to a widow on the basis that she has in her care a child of the worker is entitled to benefits. 6 This ruling applies equally to an individual Seeking to establish entitlement to husband's, widower's, or father's benefits by invoking the provisions of section 216(h)(1) of the Act, where another individual previously has been entitled to husband's, widower's or father's benefits under section 202 (c), (0 or (g). 42 U.S.C. 402 (c). (f) of (g). As more fully set forth in- the Act, these categories of benefits are analogous to wife's, widow's and mother'8 benefits, respectively, as described in footnote 5.any administrative level of review, i.e., initial, reconsideration, administrative law judge hearing or Appeals Council.7 When a claimant seeks to establish her status as the wife or widow of a worker on the basis of the deemed marriage provision and the legal widow was previously entitled, claimant's entitlement will not be barred because the legal widow was previously entitled to wife's, widow's or mother's benefits under section 202(b), (e) or (g) of the Act.8 This ruling applies equally to claims for husband's, widower's and father's benefits. See footnote 6. In such cases, the application of the deemed spouse will be adjudicated as though the legal spouse had not been entitled, except that the \"deemed spouse\" will not be entitled to wife's, widow's or mother's benefits for any months prior to the month after the month in which the former beneficiary's benefits terminated. Once the applicant has become entitled to beneifts under the deemed marriage provisions by application of this ruling, her continuing entitlement should be determined in accordance with regular SSA policies and procedures.\u00ae AR 86-20(6) Effective Date: May 23,1986. Grigg v. Fin ch, 418 F.2d 661 (6th Cir. 1969) Correction of an individual's earnings record to reflect self-employment income for years in which the individual did not timely file an income tax return 7 W o o d s o n was decided on September 25,1981, when the States which now comprise the Eleventh Circuit were part of the Fifth Circuit Under the holding in B o n n e r v . C i t y o f P r i t c h a r d , A l a b a m a , 661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir. 1981), Fifth Circuit decisions issued prior to October 1,1981 are precedents for the Eleventh Circuit. Accordingly, a Ruling of Acquiescence on W o o d s o n is provided for Eleventh Circuit residents. 8 In W o o d s o n , the widow's remarriage was the event which terminated her entitlement to benefits on the worker's account. However, the court's holding is based on the fact that her status as a widow within the meaning of section 216(h)(1)(B) has ended, and would apply equally where the former beneficiary's entitlement had terminated for some other reason. Under the Act and regulations, there are certain situations in which a widow's remarriage does not terminate her entitlement to benefits. See 20 CFR 404.337 and 404.341. The W o o d s o n case does not involve a remarriage which comes within the terms of an exeption, and this ruling is not applicable to cases which come within the terms of an exception. 9 Under SSA's policy, entitlement of a claimant under the deemed marriage provision is possible where the beneficiary previously entitled to wife's, widow's or mother's benefits had died or where the beneficiary's marriage to the insured worker was dissolved by divorce or annulment. The earliest possible month of entitlement for the deemed spouse would be the month of the former beneficiary's death, or, if applicable, dissolution, of the marriage to the insured worker. Therefore,, in this situation, both SSA policy and circuit law would permit use of the deemed marriage provision to entitle the deemed spouse.Issue Whether, after the statutory time limitation for correcting an earnings record has expired, the absence of an entry of self-employment income for a year in which no timely tax return of self-employment income was filed is conclusive evidence that no self- employment income was derived by the worker in that year. Explanation o f How SSA W ill A pply the D ecision Within the Circuit This ruling applies only where the claimant resides in Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, or Tennessee at the time of the determination or decision at any level of administrative review, i.e., initial, reconsideration, administrative law judge hearing or Appeals Council review. When evaluating a request by a worker for an amendment of his or her earnings record to reflect alleged self- employment income for a year in which the worker did not file an income tax return reflecting self-employment income and for which the statutory time limitation for filing an income tax return and for correcting the earnings record has run, SSA will credit the worker with the appropriate self-employment income for that year only where all of the following conditions are met: (1) The worker's receipt of self-employment income is documented by Internal Revenue Service Forms 1099 (2) timely filed by disinterested third parties (3) reflecting the payment of self- employment income to the worker in the period alleged.10 AR 86-21(2) Effective Date: July 3,1986.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Four management alternatives for the 483,077 acres of public land in the Uncompahgre Basin Planning Area of the Uncompahgre Basin ResourC\u00e9 Area in west-central Colorado were analyzed in the Draft RMP/EIS. The Continuation of Current Management Alternative represents the existing management guidance. This alternative corresponds to the No Action Alternative required by the r NEPA. The Production Alternative would continue multiple-use management but would promote the development, production, and transportation of resources providing and producing minerals, food, timber, and fiber. The Conservation Alternative would continue multiple-use management but would promote the conservation and protection of resources such as wilderness, cultural sites, wildlife habitats, watershed, and recreation areas. The Preferred Alternative was developed based on the analysis of the other three alternatives. It would continue multiple-use management by protecting important environmental values and sensitive resources while allowing development of resources which provide important goods and services. The Draft RMP/EIS also identifies three areas proposed for designation as ACECs:A 1,895-acre portion of Escalante Canyon west of Delta, Colorado, would be considered for special designation. This area contains several federally- listed threatened and endangered plant species and two unique plant associations. The area also receives significant recreational use. Specifically, this area is located in T. 51 N., R. 13 W sections 19, 20, 21, 22, 27, 28, 29, and 30, New Mexico Principal Meridian. An area comprised of two tracts totalling 377 acres eight miles east of Montrose, Colorado, would be considered for special designation. The tracts contain a large population of a listed endangered specie and significant populations of a candidate specie. Specifically, this area is located in T. 49 N., R. 8 W., Sections 18 and 19; T. 48 N R. 8 W., section 6; and T. 48 N., R. 9 W., section 1, New Mexico Principal Meridian. An 80-acre site consisting mainly of a volcanic geological structure with high- value scientific, interpretive, and scenic characteristics northeast of Crawford, Colorado, would be considered for special designation. Specifically, this area is located in T. 15 S., R. 91 V \\ L , section 27, 6th Principal Meridian.

ACTIO N : Notice of Realty Action M - 63929(ND), competitive sale of public land in Morton County, North Dakota. SUMMARY: The following described land has been determined to be suitable for disposal under section 203 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21,1976, 43 U.S.C. 1713 at noless than the appraised fair market value of $ 5,6 0 0.0 0. Fifth Principal Meridian, North Dakota T. 135 N., R. 81 W. Sec. 6, Lot 6, NEl /4SWl /4. Containing 74.84 acres. The land will be offered for sale by sealed bid utilizing competitive bidding procedures. The sale will be held at 10:00 A.M. MDT on September 30,1987 at the Dickinson District Office, 202 East Villard, Dickinson, North Dakota. The subject land is located approximately 20 miles south of Mandan, North Dakota. The tract has legal and physical access. The tract is isolated and generally unused by the public. It does not contain significant resource values that would justify retention. It is difficult and uneconomical to manage as part of the public land system and not suitable for management by another federal agency.

Environmental Assessment Id en tification o f P rop osed A ction The exemption would grant relief from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix R, Section III.J, for Fire Zone CB-23 located in Fire Area CB-23E. The exemption request is limited to providing separate emergency lighting units for the operation of safe shutdown equipment from the control room area. The licensee's exemption request and the bases therefor are contained in a letter dated December 1,1986, and supplemented February 20,1987. T he N eed fo r th e P rop osed A ction The proposed exemption is from Section 111.) of Appendix R to 10 CFR Part 50, which requires that emergency lighting units with at least an 8-hour battery power supply be provided in allareas'needed to operate safe shutdown equipment. This requirement extends to the access and egress routes of the subject areas, as well. The licensee currently has emergency control room lighting powered by the emergency diesel generators upon loss of offsite power, and by station batteries should the emergency dieSel generators fail. E nvironm ental Im pacts o f P rop osed A ction The proposed exemption would permit acceptance of the existing emergency lighting systems in the control room (which is common to both Units 1 and 2) as equivalent to the 8- hour battery powered emergency lighting units required by the regulation. The exemption covers only the provision of emergency lighting units needed for operation of safe shutdown equipment in the control room area. This exemption will not affect containment integrity, nor the probability of facility accidents. Thus, post-accident radiological releases will not be greater than previously determined, nor will the granting of the proposed exemption otherwise affect radiological plant effluents, or result in any significant occupational exposure. Likewise, the exemption will not affect non-radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed exemption. A ltern atives to th e P rop osed A ction Because it has been concluded that there is no measurable environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption, any alternatives to the exemption will have either no environmental impacts or greater environmental impacts. The principal alternative to granting the exemption would be to deny the requested exemption. Such action would not reduce environmental impacts of the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant Units 1 and 2 operations and would not enhance the protection of the environment. A ltern ative U se o f R esou rces This action does not involve the use of resources not previously considered in connection with the Final Environmental Statement for Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2, dated January 1974. A gen cies an d P erson s C onsulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult other agencies or persons. Finding of No Significant Impact - The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. Based on the foregoing environmentalassessment, the staff concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. For further information with respect to this action, see the application for exemption dated December 1,1986, as supplemented February 29,1987, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW, Washington, DC and at the Southport-Brunsw'ick County Library, 109 W.

Bart Buckley, A cting D irector, P roject D irectorate [Docket No. 50-458] Exemption; Gulf States Utilities Co., Cajun Electric Power Cooperative, (River Bend Station, Unit 1) I. The Gulf States Utilities Company, et al. (the licensee), is the holder of Facility Operating License No. NPF-47 which authorizes operation of the River Bend Station, Unit 1, at reactor core power levels not in excess of 2894 megawatts thermal. The facility is a boiling water reactor located at the licensee's site in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. The license provides, among other things, that the facility is subject to all rules, regulations and orders of the Commission now or hereafter in effect. II. Paragraphs III.C.3 and III.D.3 of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50, require that containment isolation valves, which may provide a pathway for leakage of containment atmosphere, be tested on at least a 24-month frequency for comparison with the limiting value of 0.6 La for Type B and Type C tests. The Gulf States Utilities Company proposed a one-time extension to this 24-month surveillance interval for conducting Type C tests on 5 containment isolation valves. The current testing interval is to be extended until the first refueling outage, which is scheduled to begin on September 15, 1987. The extensions requested for leak testing these valves vary from 5 days to 29 days as shown in the following table: 28433 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices ValveExten\u00ad sion daysDescription/ systemSize (inch) RWCU Pump Discharge.. 4 C11'VF122 ....... 16 CRD Supply to Supply... .................... 12 SWP*V174 ....... 05 12 The staff has found that approval of the proposed extension is warranted and that the proposed extension should be authorized by the granting of this one-time exemption so that the River Bend Station, Unit 1, may continue to operate until shutdown for the first refueling outage. Ill The NRC has evaluated the licensee's basis for requesting the extension in the surveillance interval and finds that not granting this exemption would require the licensee to shut down the plant on or about August 16,1987 to conduct the testing. The granting of this exemption is likely to result in a negligible reduction in containment integrity during the 5 to 29-day extension period. In evaluating the changes to the Technical Specifications and the associated exemption, the staff reviewed the licensee's technic\u00e0l justifications for the requested extension. The staff reviewed the licensee's position that a shutdown would be required to perform these tests. The staff reviewed the previous leakage test results on the specific valves subject to the request for exemption and has found that there is ample margin between the leak rate values previously measured and the limiting values in Appendix J to accommodate any additional degradation likely to occur during the period of the extension. The details of the above described review ar\u00e9 discussed in the enclosed Safety Evaluation. Based on the above information provided by the licensee and the staffs evaluation of the licensee's submittals, the NRC staff concludes that the licensee has provided an adequate basis for the conclusion that postponing the subject local leak rate tests until the first refueling outage is likely to have little effect on containment integrity. The Commission's regulations in 10 CFR 50.12 state that the Commission w ill not consider granting an exemption unless special circumstances are present. In its letter of March 10, -1987 as supplemented jun\u00e9 9 and July 8,15, and 30,1987, the licensee addressed one of those special circumstances which is applicable to this request for exemption.The licensee states that the special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v) are present in that the exemption would provide only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and became necessary because the preoperational testing was scheduled to be consistent with a projected fuel load date of April 1985. The intent of the scheduling was to allow adequate time for the first cycle of operation so as to satisfy the 24-month Type B and C testing requirements of Technical Specification 4.6.3.1.d at the first refueling outage. However, the low power license was not issued until August 29,1985 and commercial operation occurred in June 1986. Only five valves require a surveillance extension out of a total population of 166 valves at River Bend Station that are associated with Technical Specification 4.6.3.1.d and Type C outleakage testing. The exemption is temporary because these five valves will be tested during the refueling outage scheduled to begin September 15,1987. In addition, the licensee has committed to make a good faith effort to conduct these surveillances within the current frequency if an outage of sufficient length occurs. On June 18,1987, the River Bend Station entered an unscheduled outage. The licensee stated that five surveillance tests, for which surveillance interval extensions had been requested, had been performed during this outage. However, the surveillance tests of the five valves for which an exemption was requested, were not performed because of considerations of ALARA, equipment availability, and test duration which would have added a significant length of time to the outage. The licensee stated that the summer months are a time of high system demand and other sources of power in the licensee's system were not available such that the River Bend Station could be maintained out of service for the extended period. Therefore, the staff concluded that special circumstances of 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(v) associated with this request for an exemption, have been demonstrated by the licensee. Accordingly, the NRC staff finds that operation of River Bend Station, Unit 1, during the proposed extension period is acceptable. Therefore, the staff finds that the proposed temporary exemption from 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3 is acceptable. IV Accordingly, the Commission has determined that, pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the proposed exemption is authorized by law, will not endanger lifeor property or the common defense and security and is otherwise in the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby grants the exemption as follows: An exemption is granted from the requirement to conduct Type C testing on containment isolation valves at an interval no greater than 24 months as stated in 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D 3.. This exemption is granted for the period specified in the licensee's request for exemption dated March 10,1987, as supplemented July 8,1987 (from current test deadline dates which begin August 16,1987 until the first refueling outage which is scheduled to begin on September 15, 1987) and is only applicable to five valves in the River Bend Station as listed in Section II. of this exemption. Pursuant to 10 CFR 51.32, the Commission has determined that the issuance of the exemption will have no significant impact on the environment (52 FR 28054). A copy of the Commission's Safety Evaluation dated July 31,1987 related to this action is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW. Washington, DC, and at the Government Documents, Department, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803. This Exemption is effective on August 16,1987 and is to expire at the start of the first refueling outage. Dated at Bethesda, Maryland, this 31st day of July 1987.

The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of an amendment to Possession-Only License No. DPR-12 issued to Philadelphia Electric Company (the licensee) for the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Unit No. 1 (the facility) located in York County, Pennsylvania. The amendment is in response to the licensee's application dated November 24,1975, as revised March 4,1987. The amendment would accomplish the following: (1) Extend the expiration date of license No. DPR-12 to December 24, 2015; (2) delete authority 29454 Federal Register ] Vol 52, No, 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices to posses\u00ab special nuclear and source material; (31 delete the license reference to a fission product trapping system and neutron sources; and (4) revise the Technical Specifications in response to the licensee's application. The facility is permanently shut down, there is no fuel on-site and the licensee intends to maintain the facility in a shutdown, safe storage mode until after Units 2 and 3 are also shut down. At that time all residual radioactivity would be removed and the license terminated. By Amendment No. 3, dated July 14, 1975, the Commission revised License No. DPR-L2 to possess-but-not-operate status. In the related Safety Evaluation and Environmental Assessment the Commission found the decommissioning plan involving long term on-site storage of residual activity was acceptable. Prior to issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission will have made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's regulations. By September 8,1987, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject provisional operating license, and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene. Requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission' s ''Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings\" as set forth in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission, or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board designated by the Commission, or the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition, and the Secretary of the Commission or the Chairman of the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a Notice of Hearing or an appropriate Order. As required by It) CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall set forth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding, and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding. The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention should be permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) The nature of the petitioner's right undeT the Act to be made a party to the proceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial, or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) die possibleeffect of any order which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest. The petition should also identify the specific aspects) of the subject matter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Any person who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has been admitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave of the Board for up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfy the specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conference scheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to the petition to intervene which must include a list of tibe contentions which are sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contention set forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited to matters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitioner who fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirements with respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participate as a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subject to any limitations in the Order granting leave to intervene, and have the opportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, including the opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Brandi, or may be delivered to die Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW., Washington, DC by the above date.

The proposed policy requires agencies to certify that they have considered use of electronic information collection techniques as a means to reduce burden on respondents and costs to the government. D A TE: Comments from the public should be submitted no later than October 6, 1987. ADDRESS: Comments should be addressed to: J. Timothy Sprehe, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Room 3235 New Executive Office Building, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503. Telephone: (202) 395-4814, SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: OMB has a statutory responsibility under the Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices29455 Paperwork Reduction Act, as amended (44 U.S.C. Chapter 35), to establish government-wide policies that reduce the Federal paperwork burden, to enhance the appropriate application of information technology, to develop and implement uniform and consistent information resources management policies, and to oversee the development of information management principles, standards, and guidelines and to promote their use. In 1985, OMB issued OMB Circular No. A\u2014 130, Management of Federal Information Resources (50 FR 52730-52751, December 24,1985), publication of which provided a general policy framework for the management of Federal information resources. A basic assumption of Circular No. A - 130 is that the use of \u00fcp-to-date information technology offers opportunities to improve the management of government programs. One potentially useful application of information technology is the use of current technology in the government's information collections. Such use is consistent with a 1986 amendment to the Paperwork Reduction Act which stated that one of the Act's purposes is: . . . to ensure that automatic data processing, telecommunications, and other information technologies are acquired and used by the Federal Government in a manner which . . . wherever practicable and appropriate, reduces the information processing burden for the Federal Government and for persons who provide information to and for the Federal Government. (44 U.S.C. 3501 (5)) The U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Government Operations, also recommended that OM B furnish central guidance and coordination concerning the electronic collection and dissemination of information (House Report No. 99-560, April 29,1986). The General Accounting Office also recommended that OM B establish written policies to encourage the use of information technology for collecting information as a means of reducing burden on the government and the public and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of agency operations (GAO Report GAO/GGD-83-39, April ll, 1983). In 1983, GAO suggested, among other things, that: The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) could significantly increase its savings by automating the submission of more Medicare claims. Medicare forms used by institutional health service providers to bill HCFA for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries accounted for 12.4 million respondent burden hours. GAO estimated HCFA could have immediately saved thegovernment $1.3 million by automating claims in FY 1981, and that the potential cost savings could reach $5.4 million per year. \u2014The Bureau of the Census could double the volume of automated Shipper's Export Declaration (SED) reports and reduce costs significantly by encouraging electronic submission of reports. The SED forms are used by exporters and freight forwarders to report export statistics to Census for compilation of U.S. foreign trade statistics. The SED response burden was 1.67 million hours; automation could have saved the Census Bureau $183,000 in FY 1981 and could potentially yield $1.7 million in savings per year. For FY 1987, HCFA estimated that 65 percent of Medicare hospital or institutional bills and 32 percent of Medicare physician claims w ill be electronically transmitted, reducing HCFA's paperwork burden by 5.6 m illion hours. For FY 1986, the Census Bureau's SED response burden was 1.3 m illion hours. Respondents electronically filed 1.7 million out of a total of 9.2 million forms, or 19 percent of the total, and these electronic filings saved the Census Bureau approximately $500,000 in processing costs. More recently, many agencies have initiated programs aimed at accomplishing the electronic collection of substantial bodies of information from the public. \u2014The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is broadening its experimental program for electronic filing of individual income tax returns. Qualified return preparers electronically transmitted individual income tax returns for tax year 1986 to the IRS on behalf of clients. Electronic returns were filed from seven metropolitan areas (up from three in the prevous year), and taxpayers filing in three of these areas were able to elect to have their refunds directly deposited in their bank, savings and loan, or credit union accounts. The principal advantages of electronic filing are: (1) Taxpayers will receive refunds 2 to 3 weeks faster than if their returns had been filed on paper; (2) return preparers will be able to serve clients more efficiently; (3) the cost to IRS of processing, storing, and retrieving these returns will be substantially reduced; and (4) taxpayers requesting participation in the IRS direct deposit program will obtain their refunds even more quickly and conveniently. \u2014The U.S. Customs Service has initiated the Customs Automated Commercial System (ACS) to linkelectronically import-export brokers and shippers with Customs' computer system, and thereby reduce the paperwork flow between Customs and the public. ACS enables brokers to transmit directly to Customs the information about their client's cargo necessary to assess the proper tariff. Customs is able to release the cargo more quickly, determine the proper tariff, and obtain payment from the broker periodically instead of obtaining payment at the time the tariff is computed for each individual shipment. A reduction of approximately one million burden hours is anticipated by late 1988. \u2014Since 1984, the Social Security Administration (SSA) has been encouraging employers to report wage data (W-2 forms) electronically. SSA expects to receive over 60 million W - 2s electronically in 1986 and 105 million by 1989. All employers with more than 500 employees must report electronically after January 1,1987; after January 1,1988, all employers with more than 250 employees will also be covered. The primary benefits from electronic collection have been a reduction in the duplication of effort entailed in paper transactions, receipt of better service from SSA, and enhanced efficiencies in information handling. SSA has particularly benefited from more timely posting of earnings as well as reductions in manual activities, errors, and backlogs of paper, tape, and diskette handling. SSA expected a paperwork burden reduction of over 1.3 million hours due to this initiative in FY 1986 and an additional 1.9 million hour reduction in FY 1987. \u2014The Federal Maritime Commission is studying the feasibility of electronic filing of maritime tariffs. The current cost to the Commission of manually processing incoming tariff filings is approximately $485,300 annually. The filings impose an annual burden of 330,000 hours on the public. \u2014The Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) electronic filing project, Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR), is designed to automate filing, processing, and dissemination of 7 million pages of filings. The pilot program for electronic receipt and processing of filings has operated since 1984, and SEC has issued a Request for Proposal for the operational system. This system should improve the effectiveness of SEC processing of filings and ensure rapid, timely disclosure of information to investors and the financial 29456 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices community. EDGAR will affect almost all of the 38.5 million hour paperwork burden imposed by SEC. \u2014The Department of Education is testing the feasibility of major electronic collection projects involving student aid programs: The Gateway and Pell Grant Pilot projects. The Gateway project would provide for electronic processing of the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate, a major reporting requirement for campus-based programs. Respondents may transmit online or via diskette. Hie Pell Grant Pilot project encompasses the electronic transfer of information associated with the Student Aid Report. The total size of the data collections affected by these activities exceeds 300,000 burden hours annually. \u2014During F Y 1987, the Federal deposit Insurance Corporation 1FDIC) plans to achieve a reduction of 41,448 hours in the Call Reports (Reports of Condition and Income), prepared quarterly by insured State nonmember commercial banks. Part of the reduction would be achieved by adopting techniques for generating the Call Reports electronically. FDIC estimates that the average bank saves four hours each reporting period by using computers to produce its Call Reports. \u2014The Department of Transportation (DOT) is investigating electronic filing of international air cargo and passenger tariffs, and has formed a government-industry advisory committee to study the matter. There are currently more than one million effective intermational fares, rates, and rules on file at DOT, and its Office of International Aviation reviews new filings at the rate of more than 500 pages per day, a rate that is steadily increasing. Manual handling of international aviation tariffs has become unmanageable. \u2014-The Energy Information Administration (EIA), Department of Energy, has sucessfully implemented a microcomputer-based data collection for reporting radioactive waste from civilian nuclear reactors. EIA provides respondents with microcomputer software and data diskettes. Respondents verify and update the previous year's data and enter current year data on the data diskettes. EIA analysts review, edit, and verify the received data on microcomputers, and then transfer clean data files to the EIA mainframe computer for storage, aggregation, and distribution. EIA finds that the system reduces reporting errors and greatly speed the reporting cycle.These agencies have found that the application of automated data processing to government information collections can enhance the capability of agencies to meet program objectives more efficiently and effectively. In some cases, respondents report reductions in paperwork burden and other efficiencies such as convenience and more timely receipt of benefits. Benefits to the agencies of automated information collection may include resource savings due to: \u2014 Better targeting of program resources; \u2014More effective and hence less costly monitoring of programs; \u2014Cost avoidance from reductions in error rates; \u2014Decreased costs of information reporting or capture; and \u2014Increased timeliness in processing and disseminating information. In light of these agency programs and Congressional views, OMB is considering issuance of policy guidance to encourage all executive branch agencies to explore the use of automated techniques for collection of information. When final, this guidance will be issued as an appendix to OMB Circular No. A-13Q, Management of Federal Information Resources. The purpose of this policy guidance is, first, to cause agencies systematically to take account of potential management efficiencies derivable from electronic information collection, and second, to ensure that agencies consider the major legal and policy issues that arise in connection with such collection. The policy guidance that OM B has under consideration, and concerning which OM B seeks public comment, follows. Policy on Electronic Collection of Information 1. G en eral P olicy For all collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C., Chapter 35), agencies shall certify when submitting the information collections for OMB approval, that they have considered use of electronic collection techniques as a means to reduce burden on respondents and costs to the government. 2: F e a sib ility o f E lectron ic Inform ation C ollection a. Agencies should examine their information collection to determine whether conditions favor the electronic collection of information. Conditions favorable to electronic collection include: (1) The agency routinely converts the information collected to electronic format:(2) A substantial proportion of respondents are known to possess the necessary information technology and to maintain the information in electronic form; (3) Conversion to electronic reporting, if mandatory will not impose substantial costs or other adverse effects on respondents, expecially small business entities; (4) The information collection seeks a relatively large volume of data and/or reaches a large number of respondents; (5) The information collection is relatively frequent; i.e., annually or more frequently; and (6) The content and format of the information sought by the information collection does not change significantly over several years. b. Where most of the foregoing conditions are present, electronic collection may be advantageous, and agencies should conduct benefit-cost analyses to determine whether the benefits of electronic collection, including dollar savings and reduction in paperwork burden, outweigh the capitalization and other costs both to the government and to respondents. c. Where agencies determine that benefits outweigh costs, they should actively pursue the design and development of electronic collection systems. 3. D esign an d D evelopm ent a. In designing and developing electronic information collecting systems, agencies should ensure that records subject to the Privacy Act, and information permitted to be exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act or any other legislative or regulatory provision, are adequately and properly protected. b. Agencies should avoid designing and developing electronic collection systems in which sector contractors are expected to pay for the costs of governmental functions associated with systems. c. Agencies should consider private sector capabilities for performing cost benefit analyses and in the design, development, and implementation of electronic information collection systems. d. In designing and developing an electronic information collection system, agencies should consult regularly with the likely respondents to the information collection and try to accommodate their suggestions. e. Where mandatory electronic reporting is imposed, agencies should develop procedures permitting waiver from electronic reporting for those Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices 29457 respondents who may incur unreasonable costs. f. Where agencies plan to electronically disseminate the information collected electronically, they should design and develop systems so as to integrate collection and dissemination into the same systems insofar as possible. g. Where electronically collected records are subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act or are to be made publicly accessible for any other reason, agencies should provide for such access in the design and development of the collection system. h. Agencies should incorporate records management and archival considerations in the design, development, and implementation of electronic information collection systems in accordance with the Federal Records Act (44 U.S.C. 29,31, and 33).

The proposed rule change adds new rule G - 10, which requires municipal securities dealers to deliver a copy of the MSRB'sinvestor brochure 1 to a customer upon receipt of a written complaint from the customer concerning a municipal securities transaction. The proposed rule change also amends M SRB Rule G- 8(a)(xii), which requires dealers to keep a record of all written customer complaints and what actions the dealer took in response. The amendment to Rule G-8(a)(xii) requires the dealer to annotate the written complaint file to reflect the mailing of the brochure. This will enable regulatory agencies to inspect for compliance with Rule G-10 through periodic review of the file. Notice of the proposed rule change was given in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 24626 (June 22,1987), 52 FR 24081. The Commission received no comments on the proposal.

Molleur, Staff Attorney (202) 272-2363, or Curtis R. Hilliard, Special Counsel (202) 272-3030 (Division of Investment Management). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORM ATION: Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from either the SEC's Public Reference Branch in person or the SEC's commercial copier who can be contacted at (800) 231-3282 (in Maryland (301) 258-4300). Applicant's Representations % Applicant, a Delaware corporation organized in March 1985, is wholly- owned by Thrift Investment Services (\"TIS\"), a California limited partnership. Applicant is a limited purpose finance corporation organized to facilitate the financing of long-term residential mortgages on one-to-four family and multi-family residences through the issuance, directly or through the formation of one or more Trusts, of one or more series of bonds secured by such mortgages. Applicant will not engage in any business or investment activities unrelated to such purpose. The exemption requested in this application pertains only to the business activities of the Applicant in connection with the organization of the Trusts, the Trusts' proposed issue and sale of Bonds (as described below) and the proposed sale of beneficial interests in such Trusts. 2. Each Trust will issue one or more series (\"Series\") of bonds (\"Bonds\"), secured primarily by Mortgage Certificates,1 pursuant to a terms indenture incorporating by reference standard indenture provisions (collectively, an \"Indenture\") between a Trust and a commercial bank acting as trustee for the bondholders (\"Bond Trustee\"). Each Indenture will be subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 or appropriately exempt therefrom. Each Trust will be created pursuant to an agreement (\"Trust Agreement\") between Applicant, acting as depositor, and a bank, trust 1 The \"Mortgage Certificates\" collateralizing the Bonds will be limited to fully modified pass-through mortgage-backed certificates fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by the Government National Mortgage Corporation (\"GNMA Certificates\"), Mortgage Participation Certificates issued by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"FHLMC Certificates\"), Guaranteed Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association (\"FNMA Certificates\"), and reinvestment earnings and distributions on such Mortgage Certificates. In addition to the Mortgage Certificates directly securing the Bonds, a Series may have additional collateral which may include certain collection accounts and reserve funds as specified in the related Indenture (collectively with the Mortgage certificates, \"Collateral\" or \"bond Collateral\").; 1987 / Notices company or other fiduciary (expected to be Wilmington Trust Company) acting as owner trustee (\"Owner Trustee\"). It is anticipated that the Owner Trustee will enter into a bond administration agreement with respect to each Trust whereby TIS will provide certain management services in connection with the issuance of the Bonds. 3. In the case of each Series of Bonds: (a) Payments on the mortgage loans underlying the Mortgage Certificates securing the Bonds will be the primary source of funds for payments of principal and interest due on such Bonds; (b) the Bonds will be secured by collateral consisting primarily of Mortgage Certificates having an aggregate Collateral Value (as defined in the Indenture) at least equal to the outstanding principal balance of such Bonds; (c) scheduled available principal and interest payments on the Mortgage Certificates securing the Bonds (together with any required payments from any reserve funds with respect to the Bonds) plus income received thereon at the assumed reinvestment rate will be sufficient to make the interest payments on and amortize the principal of such Bonds by their stated maturities; and (d) the Mortgage Certificates will be pledged in their entirety by each Trust to the Bond Trustee and will be subject to the lien of the related Indenture. 4. The Applicant may sell some or all of its equity interest in such Trusts (\"Trust Certificates\") to institutional or non-institutional investors which customarily engage in the purchase of mortgages and mortgage-related securities, in transactions not constituting a public offering under section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (\"1933 Act\"). Applicant's Legal Conclusions 1. The sale of Trust Certificates will will not alter the payment of cash flows under any Indenture, including the amounts to be deposited in the collection account or any reserve fund created pursuant to an Indenture to support payments of principal and interest on the Bonds. 2. The interests of the Bondholders will not be compromised or impaired by the ability of Applicant to sell beneficial interests in each Trust and there will not be a conflict of interest between the Bondholders and Owners for several reasons: (a) The Bond Collateral that will be deposited in each Trust will not be speculative in nature; (b) the Bonds will be issued only if an independent nationally recognized statistical rating agency has rated such Bonds in one of the two highest rating categories; (c) the Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices 29461 relevant Indenture subjects the Bond Collateral, all income distributions thereon and all proceeds from a conversion, voluntary, of any such collateral to a first priority perfected security interest in the name of the Bond Trustee on behalf of the the Bondholders. 3. Further, neither the Owners nor the Bond Trustee will be able to impair the security afforded by the Mortgage Certificates to the holders of the Bonds (\"Bondholders\") because without the consent of each affected Bondholder, neither the Owners nor the Bond Trustee will be able to: (1) Change the stated maturity on any Bonds; (2) reduce the prinicipal amount, or the rate of interest on any Bond; (3) change the priority of repayment on any class of any Series of Bonds; (4) impair or adversely affect the Mortgage Certificates securing a Series of Bonds; (5) permit the creation of a lien ranking prior to or in parity with the lien of the related Indenture with respect to the Mortgage Certificates; or (6) otherwise deprive the Bondholders of the security afforded by the lien of the related Indenture. 4. The sale of Trust Certificates will not alter the payment of cash flows under any Indenture, including the amount to be deposited in the collection account or any reserve fund. The aggregate interests of the Owners in the Bond Collateral and the expected returns earned by them will be far less than the payments made to Bondholders. Applicants do not intend to deposit Mortgage Certificates to secure a Series of Bonds the Collateral of which exceeds 110% of the gross proceeds of the Bonds of such Series. Pricing efficiencies mandate that the Bond Collateral does not substantially exceed the amount of such collateral which is required to be pledged in order to satisfy the standards of the rating organization that is rating the Bonds. Thus the excess cash flow from the collateral which is available to Owners always will be far less than the cash flow from the collateral that used to make principal and interest payments to Bondholders. Further, except for the limited rights to substitute Bond Collateral, it will not be possible for the Owners to alter the collateral initially deposits into a Trust, and, in no event will such right to substitute Bond Collateral result in a diminution in the value of quality of such collateral. Therefore, although substituted Bond Collateral may be a different prepayment experience that the original collateral, the interests of the Bondholders will not be impairedbecause: (a) The prepayment experience of any collateral will be determined by market conditions beyond the control of the Owners, which market conditions are likely to affect all mortgage certificates of similar payment terms and maturities in a similar fashion; (b) the interests of the Owners are not likely to be greatly different from those of the Bondholders with respect to collateral prepayment experience; and (c) to the extent that the Owners may cause the substitution of collateral which has a different prepayment experience that the original collateral, this situation is no different for the Bondholders than the traditional collateralized mortgage obligation structure where bonds are issued by an entity that is a wholly-owned subsidiary. 5. The election by any Trust to be treated as a real estate mortgage investment conduit (\"REMIC\") will have no effect on the level of the expenses that would be incurred by any such Trust. Administrative fees and expenses will be provided for in a manner satisfactory to the agency or agencies rating the Bonds. 8. The requested order is necessary - and appropriate in the public interest because: (1) The applicant and the Trusts are not the type of entities to which the provisions of the 1940 Act were intended to apply; (2) applicant may be unable to proceed with its proposed business if the uncertainties concerning the applicability of the 1940 Act are not removed; (3) applicant's proposed business is intended to serve a recognized and critical public need; and (4) granting of the requested order will be consistent with the protection of investors because they will be protected during the offering and sale of the Bonds by the registration or exemptive provisions of the 1933 Act and thereafter by the Bond Trustee representing their interests under the Indenture; and (5) the disclosure to Owners of a Trust and the limitation of the Owners of each Trust to no more than 100 sophisticated investors provide safeguards adequate to assure that such potential Owner do not require the protection of the 1940 Act. Applicant's Conditions Applicant agrees that if an order is granted it will be expressly conditioned on the following: A. Conditions Relating to the Bonds (1) Each Series of Bonds will be registered under the 1933 Act, unless offered in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to section 4(2) of the 1933 Act.(2) The Bonds will be \"mortgage related securities\" within the meaning of section 3(a)(41) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the collateral directly securing the Bonds will be limited to GNMA, FNMA, or FHLMC Certificates. (3) If new mortgage collateral is substituted, the substitute collateral must: (i) Be of equal or better quality than the collateral replaced; (ii) have similar payment terms and cash flow as the collateral replaced; (iii) be insured or guaranteed to the same extent as the collateral replaced; (iv) meet the conditions set forth in paragraphs (2) and (4) herein. In addition, new collateral may not be substituted for more than 40% of the aggregate face amount of the Mortgage Certificates initially pledged as mortgage collateral. In no event may any mortgage collateral be substituted for any substitute mortgage collateral. (4) All Mortgage Certificates, funds, accounts or other collateral securing the Series of Bonds will be held by the Bond Trustee or on behalf of the Bond Trustee by an independent custodian. Neither the Bond Trustee nor the custodian will be an affiliate (as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act) of Applicant. The Bond Trustee will be provided with a first priority perfected security or lien interest in and to all Bond Collateral. (5) Each Series of Bonds will be rated in one of the two highest bond rating categories by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating agency . (\"Rating Agency\") that is not affiliated with Applicant. The Bonds will be considered \"redeemable securities\" within the meaning of section 2(a)(32) o f the 1940 Act. (6) No less ofter than annually, an indepedent public accountant will report on whether the anticipated payments of principal and interest on the mortgage collateral continue to be adequate to pay the principal of the interest on the Bonds in accordance with their terms. Upon completion, copies of the auditor's report(s) will be provided to the Bond Trustee. B. C onditions R elatin g to V ariable-R ate B onds (1) Each Class of Bonds of a Series bearing a variable interest rate will have a set maximum interest rate. (2) At the time of the deposit of the - Collateral with a Trust, as well as during the term of the Bonds issued by such Trust, the Mortgage Collateral securing such Bonds will have scheduled cash flows sufficient (together with cash available to be withdrawn 29462 Federal Register / Vol. 52, N o. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices from any debt service funds, reserve funds, over-collateralization funds or other funds), together with reinvestment income thereon at assumed reinvestment rates acceptable to the Rating Agency rating the Bonds of such Series, to make timely payments of principal of and interest on the Bonds in accordance with their terms and to pay all of the fees and expenses of the Trust with respect to the Series of Bonds, assuming the maximum interest on each Class of Bonds bearing a variable interest rate. Such Collateral will be paid down as the mortgages underlying the Mortgage Collateral are repaid, but will not be released from the lien of the Indenture prior to payment of the Bonds. C. C onditions R elatin g to REM ICs The election by any Trust to be treated as REM IC will have no effect on the level of the expenses that would be incurred by any such Trust. Any Trust that makes a REM IC election w ill provide for the payment of administrative fees and expenses as set forth in the application, and the anticipated level of fees and expenses will be more than adequately provided for regardless of the method selected. D. C onditions R elatin g to th e S a le o f C ertificates o f B e n e fic ia l O w nership (1) The Beneficial Owners of each Trust will agree to be bound by the terms of the applicable Trust Agreement (2) Trust Certificates in each Trust will be offered and sold only to (i) institutions or (ii) non-institutions which are \"accredited investors\" as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act. Institutional investors will have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be capable of evaluating the risks of the purchase of the Trust Certificates and understand the volitility of interest rate fluctuaions as they affect the value of mortgages, mortgage-related securities and residual interests in mortgage-related securities, such as those represented by the Trust Certificates, Non-institutional accredited investors will be limited to not more than 15, will purchase at least $200,000 of the Trust Certificates and will have a net worth at the time of purchase that exceeds $1,000,000 (exclusive of their primary residence). In addition, non- institutional accredited investors will have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters, specifically in the field of mortgage- related securities, as to be capable of evaluating the risks of the purchase of the Trust Certificates and will have direct, personal and significant experience in making investments inmortgage-related securities and because of such knowledge and experience, understand the volatility of interest rate fluctuations as they affect the value of mortgage-related securities and residual interests in mortgage-related securities (such institutional investors and non- institutional investors, \"Eligible Investors\"). Eligible Investors will be limited to mortgage lenders, thrift institutions, commercial and investment banks, savings and loan associations, pension funds, employee benefit plans, insurance companies, mutual funds, real estate investment trusts or other institutional or knowledgeable non\u00ad institution investors as described above which customarily engage in the purchase of mortgages and mortgage- related securities. The Owner-Trustee with respect to a Trust will act as trustee for and the direction of the Beneficial Owners of such Trust (3) Each sale of Trust Certificates in a Trust to a Eligible Investor will qualify as a transaction not involving any public offering within the meaning of section 4(2) of the 1933 A ct (4) The Trust Agreement relating to each Trust will prohibit the transfer of any Trust Certificate in such Trust if there would be more than one hundred Beneficial Owners of such Trust at any time. (5) The Trust Agreement relating to each Trust will require that each purchaser of a Trust Certificate in such Trust represent that it is purchasing such Trust Certificate for investment purposes and not with a view to distribution thereof, in whole or in part, and that it will hold such Trust Certificate in its own name and not as nominee for undisclosed investors. (6) The Trust Agreement relating to each Trust will provide that (i) no Beneficial Owner of such Trust may be affiliated with the Bond Trustee for such Trust, (ii) no holders of a controlling (as that term is defined in Rule 405 under the 1933 Act) equity interest in such Trust may be affiliated with either the custodian of the Collateral for a Series of Bonds issued by such trust or the Rating Agency rating the Bonds issued by such trust, and (iii) the Owner- Trustee for such Trust will not purchase any Trust Certificates in such Trust but will function as a legal stakeholder for the assets of such Trust.

Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on a mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No 11-2 which describes the application procedure. The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) to modify the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport ARSA as follows: 1. Eliminate the area between eight and ten miles between the San Fernando Reservoir and the Sim i Valley Freeway. This airspace is predomiriently utilized by flight transiting the Newhall Pass. The terminus for radar and communications coverage in the vicinity of this sector of the ARSA very nearly approximates the northern boundary of the ARSA. Consequently, aircraft seldom are capable of complying with the ARSA requirement for communicating with air traffic control (ATC) prior to encroachment upon the boundary of this airspace. Furthermore, ATC service is derogated as aircraftmust be identified, provided ARSA service and transitioned to the Tower at Van Nuys or Unicom at Whiteman within a very short flight distance. 2. Eliminate the area between five and ten miles to the east between the 090\u00b0 bearing and the 104\u00b0 bearing. Adequate radar and communication coverage does not exist in this segment below 4,000 feet MSL. 3. Eliminate the surface area east of a direct line from a point originating at the 004\u00b0 bearing, five-mile radius to the 090\u00b0 bearing, five-mile radius. Adequate radar and communication coverage below 3,500 feet MSL does not exist in this area. 4. Expand the surface area exclusion around Whiteman Airport. This area would be increased to a 1.75-mile radius of the Whiteman Airport to accommodate the variety and numbers of aircraft which are frequently in the traffic pattern and better enable those aircraft to maintain a traffic pattern which is clear of ARSA surface areas. The elimination of ARSA airspace in each of the above instances is directly attributable to reduced ATC service capability at altitudes affected by * terrain features. Coverage by radar and/ or communication equipment is limited to line of sight. Terrain prevents an acceptable degree of coverage in certain portions of the ARSA. Temporary loss o f radio or radar coverage is not an uncommon situation when operating at certain altitudes when the ATC facility is located in close proximity to higher terrain. Normally this is not considered an adverse factor in ATC's ability to provide services, as instrument flight rules (IFR) operations are conducted at altitudes which ensure adequate coverage, and visual flight rules (VFR) operations are advisory in nature with voluntary pilot participation. To the maximum extent practicable, FAA, in the development of regulatory airspace, ensures adequate coverage is provided. R egulatory E valuation The proposed modifications to the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport ARSA are intended to improve the utility of the affected airspace. The proposal to eliminate a small amount of airspace from the ARSA is not expected to result in any costs associated with a reduction in the controlled airspace. The affected airspace currently is not within sufficient radar and/or communications coverage necessary to provide ARSA services because of terrain features. Adjusting the ARSA boundaries will not alter this situation. Reconfiguring the ARSA to more accurately reflect the terrain characteristics will improve the Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules 29471 efficiency of its operations, and various users, especially the users of Whiteman Airport, will benefit from the restoration of this airspace. The FAA has determined that the economic impact of this proposal is so minimal as not to require further regulatory evaluation. A copy of the regulatory evaluation for the original Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena ARSA is available for review in FAA Airspace Docket No. 85-AWA-2. For the reasons listed above, this proposal (1) is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291; and (2) is not a \"significant rule\" under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 F R 11034; February 26, 1979). In tern ation al Trade Im pact A nalysis This proposed regulation will only affect terminal airspace operating procedures at one location within the United States. As such, it will have no affect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States, nor will it affect the sale of United States aviation products or services in foreign countries. R eg u lato ry Flexibility D eterm ination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. Small entities are independently owned and operated small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Throughout the ARSA program the FAA has attempted to eliminate potentially adverse impacts on satellite airports within five-nautical miles of ARSA centers and the small businesses based at these airports, as well as flight training, soaring, ballooning, parachuting, ultralight, and banner towing activities, by developing special procedures to accommodate these activities through local agreements between ATC facilities and the affected organizations, or in some cases, providing exclusions for these airports. This modification of the Burbank- Glendale-Pasadena Airport ARSA will slightly expand the exclusion in the vicinity of Whiteman Airport and ease local operations for this airport. For these reasons, the FAA certifies that the proposed amendment, if adopted, will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required under the terms of the RFA.

A gen da Presentation of Meeting Procedures FAA Presentation of Proposal Public Presentations and Discussion Background On April 22,1982, the National Airspace Review (NAR) plan was published in the Federal Register (47 FR 17448). The plan encompassed a review of airspace use and procedural aspects of the ATC system. Among the main objectives of the NAR was the improvement of the ATC system by increasing efficiency and reducing complexity. In its review of terminal airspace, NAR Task Group 1-2 concluded that TRSA's should be replaced. Four types of airspace configurations were considered as replacement candidates, of which M od el B, since redesignated ARSA, was the consensus recommendation. In response, the FAA published N A R Recommendation 1-2.2.1, \"Replace Terminal Radar Service Areas with Model B Airspace and Service\" in Notice 83-9 (July 28,1983; 48 FR 34286) proposing the establishment of ARSA's at the Robert Mueller Municipal A irport, Federal Register / Vol, 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules29475 Austin, TX, and the Port of Columbus International Airport, Columbus, OH. ARSA*8 were designated at these airports on a temporary basis by SFAR No. 45 (October 28,1983; 48 FR 50038) in order to provide an operational confirmation of the ARSA concept for potential application on a national basis. Following a confirmation period of more than a year, the FAA adopted the NAR recommendation and, on February 27,1985, issued a final rule (50 FR 9252; March 6,1985) defining an ARSA and establishing air traffic rules for operation within such an area. Concurrently, by separate rulemaking action, ARSA's were permanently established at the Austin, TX, and Columbus, OH, airports and also at the Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Baltimore, MD, (50 FR 9250; March 6,1985). The FAA has stated that future notices would propose ARSA's for other airports at which TRSA procedures were in effect. Additionally, the NAR Task Group recommended that the FAA develop quantitative criteria for proposing to establish ARSA's at locations other than those which are included in the TRSA replacement program. The task group recommended that these criteria take into account, among other things, traffic mix, flow and density, airport configuration, geographical features, collision risk assessment, and ATC capabilities to provide service to users. This criteria has been developed and is being published via the FAA directives system. The FAA has established ARSA's at 89 locations under a paced implementation plan to replace TRSA's with ARSA's. This is one of a series of notices to implement ARSA's at locations with TRSA's, Related Rulemaking This notice proposes ARSA designation at three locations identified as candidates for an ARSA in the preamble to Amendment No 71-10 (50 FR 9252). Other candidate locations will be proposed in future notices published in the Federal Register. T h e Current Situation at the Proposed ARSA Locations A TRSA is currently in effect at the locations at which ARSA's are proposed in this notice. A TRSA consists of the airspace surrounding a designated airport where ATC provides radar vectoring, sequencing, and separation for all aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) and for participating aircraft operating under visual flight rules (VFR), TRSA airspaceand operating rules are not established by regulation, and participation by pilots operating under VFR is voluntary, although pilots are urged to participate. This level of service is known as Stage III and is provided at all locations identified as TRSA's. The NAR task group recommended the replacement of most TRSA's with ARSA's, A number of problems with the TRSA program were identified by the task group. The task group stated that because there are different levels of service offered within the TRSA, users are not always sure of what restrictions or privileges exist, or how to cope with them. According to the task group, there is a shared feeling among users that TRSA's are often poorly defined, are generally dissimilar in dimensions, and encompass more area than is necessary or desirable. There are other users who believe that the voluntary nature of the TRSA does not adequately address the problems associated with nonparticipating aircraft operating in relative proximity to the airport and associated approach and departure courses. There is strong advocacy among user organizations that terminal radar facilities should provide all pilots the same service, in the same way, and, to the extent feasible, within standard size airspace designations. Certain provisions of FAR \u00a7 91,87 add to the problem identified by the task group. For example, aircraft operating under VFR to or from a satellite airport and within the airpprt traffic area (ATA) of the primary airport are excluded from the two-way radio communications requirement of \u00a7 91.87. This condition is acceptable until the volume and density of traffic at the primary airport dictates further action. The Proposal The FAA is considering an amendment to \u00a7 71.501 of Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) to establish ARSA's at the following three locations: Fayetteville Municipal/Grannis SC. Fayetteville Municipal/Grannis Field Airport is a public airport, while Pope AFB and Shaw AFB are military airports at which nonregulatory TRSA'a are currently in effect. The proposed locations are depicted on charts in Appendix 1 to this notice. FAA regulations, 14 CFR 91.88, define ARSA and prescribe operating rules for aircraft, ultralight vehicles, and parachute jump operations in airspace designated as an ARSA, The ARSA rule provides in part that, prior to entering the ARSA, any aircraft arriving at any airport in an ARSA orflying through an ARSA must; (1) Establish two-way radio communications with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the area, and (2) while in the ARSA, maintain two-way radio communications with that ATC facility. For aircraft departing from the primary airport within the ARSA, two- way radio communications must be maintained with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the area. For aircraft departing a satellite airport within the ARSA, two-way radio communications must be established as soon as practicable after takeoff with the ATC facility having jurisdiction over the area, and thereafter maintained while operating within the ARSA. All aircraft operating within an ARSA are required to comply with all ATC clearances and instructions and any FAA arrival or departure traffic pattern for the airport of intended operation, However, the rule permits ATC to authorize appropriate deviations to any of the operating requirements of the rule when safety considerations justify the deviation or more efficient utilization of the airspace can be attained. Ultralight vehicle operations and parachute jumps in an ARSA may only be conducted under the terms of an ATC authorization. The FAA adopted the NAR task group recommendation that each ARSA be of the same airspace configuration insofar as practicable. The standard ARSA consists of airspace within 5 nautical miles of the primary airport extending from the surface to an altitude of 4,000 feet above that airport's elevation, and that airspace hetween 5 and 10 nautical miles from the primary airport from 1,200 feet above the surface to an altitude of 4,000 feet above that airport's elevation. Proposed deviation from the standard has been necessary at some airports due to adjacent regulatory airspace, international boundaries, topography, or unusual operational requirements. Definitions, operating requirements, and specific airspace designations applicable to ARSA may be found in 14 CFR Part 71, \u00a7\u00a7 71,14 and 71,501, 91, \u00a7 and 91.88. For the reasons discussed under \"Regulatory Evaluation,\" the FAA has determined that this proposed regulation is not a \"major rule\" under Executive Order 12291 and is not a \"significant rule\" under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979). Regulatory Evaluation The FAA has conducted a Regulatory Evaluation of the proposed 29476 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules establishment of these additional ARSA sites. The major findings of that evaluation are summarized below, and the evaluation is available in the regulatory docket. a. C osts Costs which potentially could result from the establishment of additional ARSA sites fall into the following categories: (1) Air traffic controller staffing, controller training, and facility equipment costs incurred by the FAA. (2) Costs associated with the revision of charts, notification of the public, and pilot education. (3) Additional operating costs for circumnavigating or flying over the ARSA. (4) Potential delay costs resulting from operations within an ARSA rather than a TRSA. (5) The need for some operators to purchase radio transceivers. (6) Miscellaneous costs. It has been the FAA's experience, however, that these potential costs do not materialize to any appreciable degree, and when they do occur, they are transitional, relatively low in magnitude, or attributable to specific implementation problems that have been experienced at a very small minority of ARSA sites. The reasons for these conclusions are presented below. FAA expects that the additional ARSA sites proposed in this notice can be implemented without requiring additional controller personnel above current authorized staffing levels, because participation at these TRSA locations is already quite high, and the reduced separation standards permitted in ARSA's will allow controllers to absorb the slight increase in i participating traffic by handling all traffic much tnore efficiently. Further, because controller training will be conducted during normal working hours, and existing TRSA facilities already operate the necessary radar equipment, FAA does not expect to incur any appreciable implementation costs. Essentially, the FAA will modify its terminal radar procedures at the proposed ARS\u00c0 sites in a manner that will make more efficient Use of existing resources. No additional costs \u00e0r\u00eb expected to be incurred because of the need to revise sectional charts to remove TRSA airspace depictions and incorporate the new ARSA airspace boundaries. Changes of this nature are routinely made during charting cycles, and the planned effective dates for newly established ARSA's are scheduled tocoincide with the regular 6-month chart publication intervals. This rulemaking proceeding and process will satisfy much of the need to notify the public and educate pilots about ARSA operations. The informal public meeting being held at each location where an ARSA is being proposed provides pilots with th\u00e8 best opportunity to learn both how an \u00c0RSA works and h\u00f2w it will affect their local operations. The expenses associated with these public meetings are considered costs attributable to the rulemaking process; however, any public information costs following establishment of a new ARSA are strictly attributable to the ARSA. The FAA expects to distribute a Letter to Airmen to all pilots residing within 50 miles of ARSA sites explaining the operation and configuration of the ARSA finally adopted. The FAA also has issued an Advisory Circular on ARSA's. The combined Letter to Airmen and prorated Advisory Circular costs have been estimated to be approximately $500 for each ARSA site. This cost is incurred only once upon the initial establishment of an ARSA. Information on ARSA's following the establishment of additional sites will also be disseminated at aviation safety seminars conducted throughout the country by various district offices. These seminars are regularly provided by the FAA to discuss a variety of aviation safety issues and, therefore, will not involve additional costs strictly as a result of the ARSA program. Additionally, no significant costs are expected to be incurred as a result of the follow-on user meetings that will be held at each site following implementation of the ARSA which will allow users to provide feedback to the FAA on local ARSA operations. These meetings are being held at public or other facilities which are being provided free of charge or at nominal cost. Further, because these meetings are being conducted by local FAA facility personnel, no travel, per diem, or overtime costs will be incurred by regional or headquarters personnel. FAA anticipates that some pilots who currently transit a TRSA without establishing radio communications or participating in radar services may choose to circumnavigate the mandatory participation airspace of an ARSA rather than participate. Some minor delay costs will be incurred by these pilots because of the additional aircraft variable operating cost and lost crew and passenger time resulting from the deviation. Other pilots may elect to overfly the ARS\u00c0, or transit below the 1,200 feet above ground level (AGL)floor between the 5- and 10-nautical- mile rings. Although this will hot result in any appreciable delay, a small additional fuel burn will result from the climb portion of the altitude adjustment (which will be offset somewhat by the descent). FAA recognizes that the potential exists for delay to develop at some locations Following establishment of an ARSA. The additional traffic that the radar facilities will be handling as a result of the mandatory participation requirement may, in some instances, result in minor delays to aircraft operations. FAA does not expect such delay to be appreciable. FAA expects that the greater flexibility afforded controllers in handling traffic as a result of the reduced separation standards will keep delay problems to a minimum. Those that do occur will be transitional in nature, diminishing as facilities gain operating experience with ARSA's and learn how to tailor procedures and allocate resources to take fullest advantage of the increased efficiencies due to the implementation of the ARSA. This has been the experience at most of the locations where ARSA's have been in effect for the longest period of time and is the recurring trend at the locations that have been more recently designated. The FAA does not expect that any operator will find it necessary to install radio transceivers as a result of establishing the ARSA's proposed in this notice. Aircraft operating to and from primary airports already are required to have two-way radio communications capability because of existing airport traffic areas and. therefore, will not incur any additional costs as a result of the proposed ARSA's- Further, the FAA has made an effort to minimize these potential costs throughout the ARSA program by providing airspace exclusions, or cutouts, for satellite airports located within 5 nautical miles of the ARSA center where the ARSA would otherwise have extended down to the surface. Procedural agreements between the local ATC facility and the affected airports have also been used to avoid radio installation costs. At some proposed ARSA locations, special situations might exist where establishment of an ARSA could impose certain costs on users of that airspace. However, exclusions, cutouts, and special procedures have been used extensively throughout the ARSA program to alleviate adverse impacts on local fixed base and airport operators. Similarly, the FAA has eliminated potential adverse impacts oh existing 29477Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Proposed Rules flight training practice areas, as well as soaring, ballooning, parachuting, ultralight and banner towing activities, by developing special procedures to accommodate these activities through local agreements between ATC facilities and the affected organizations. For these reasons, the FAA does not expect that any such adverse impact will occur at the candidate ARSA sites proposed in this notice. . b. B enefits Much of the benefit that will result from ARSA's is nonquantifiable and is attributable to simplification and standardization of ARSA configurations and procedures, which should eliminate much of the confusion currently experienced by pilots when operating in nonstandard TRSA's. Further, once experience is gained in ARSA operations, the air traffic controllers will gain greater flexibility in handling traffic within an ARSA which will enable them to move traffic more efficiently than under the current TRSA's. These expected savings may or may not offset the delay that some sites may experience after the initial establishment of an ARSA, but are expected to eventually provide overall time savings to all traffic, IFR as well as VFR, as both pilots and controllers become more familiar with ARSA operating procedures. Some of the benefits of the ARSA cannot be specifically attributed to individual candidate airports, but rather will result from the overall improvements in terminal area ATC procedures realized as ARSA's are implemented throughout the country. ARSA s have the potential of reducing both near and actual midair collisions at the airports where they are established. Based upon the experience at the Austin and Columbus ARSA confirmation sites, FAA estimates that near midair collisions may be reduced by approximately 35 to 40 percent. Further, FAA estimates that implementation of the ARSA program nationally may prevent approximately one midair collision every 1 to 2 years throughout the United States. The quantifiable benefits of preventing a midair collision can range from less than $100,000, resulting from the prevention of a minor nonfatal accident between general aviation aircraft, to $300 million or more, resulting from the prevention of a midair collision involving a large air carrier aircraft and numerous fatalities. Establishment of ARSA's at the sites proposed in this notice will contribute to these improvements in safety.c, Comparison o f Costs an d B enefits A direct comparison of the costs and benefits of this proposal is difficult for a number of reasons. Many of the benefits of the rule are nonquantifiable, and it is difficult to specifically attribute the ' standardization benefits, as well as the safety benefits, to individual candidate ARSA sites, FAA expects that any adjustment problems that may be experienced at the ARSA locations proposed in this notice will only be temporary, and that once established, the ARSA's will result in an overall improvement in efficiency in terminal area operations. This has been the experience at the vast majority of ARSA sites that have already been implemented. In addition to these operational efficiency improvements, establishment of the proposed ARSA sites will contribute to a reduction in near and actual midair collisions. For these reasons, FAA expects that establishment of the ARSA sites proposed in this notice will produce long term, ongoing benefits that will far ' exceed their costs, which are essentially transitional in nature. International Trade Im pact A nalysis This proposed regulation will only affect terminal airspace operating procedures at selected airports within the United States. As such, it will have- no effect on the sale of foreign aviation products or services in the United States, nor will it affect the sale of United States aviation products or services in foreign countries. R egulatory Flexibility D eterm ination The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not - unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by government regulations. Small entities are independently owned and operated small businesses and small not-for-profit organizations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The small entities that potentially could be affected by implementation of the ARSA program include the fixed- base operators, flight schools, agricultural operators and other small aviation businesses located at satellite airports within 5 nautical miles of the ARSA center. If the mandatory participation requirement were to extend down to the surface at these airports, where under current regulations participation in the TRSA and radio communication with ATC is voluntary, operations at these airportsmight be altered, and Some business could be lost to airports outside of the ARSA core. FAA has proposed to exclude many satellite airports located within 5 nautical miles of the primary airport at candidate ARSA sites to avoid adversely impacting their operations and to simplify coordinating ATC responsibilities between the primary and satellite airports. In some cases, the same purposes will be achieved through Letters of Agreement between ATC and the affected airports that establish special procedures for operating to and . from these airports. In this manner, FAA expects to eliminate any adverse impact on the operations of small satellite airports that potentially could result from the ARSA program. Similarly, FAA expects to eliminate potentially adverse impacts on existing flight training practice areas, as well as soaring, ballooning, parachuting, ultralight, and banner towing activities, by developing special procedures that will accommodate these activities through local agreements between ATC facilities and the affected organizations. FAA has utilized such arrangements extensively in implementing the ARSA's that have been established to date. Further, because the FAA expects that any delay problems that may initially develop following implementation of an ARSA will be transitory, and because the airports that will be affected by the ARSA program represent only a small proportion of all the public use airports in operation within the United States, small entities of any type that use aircraft in the course of their business will not be adversely impacted. For these reasons, the FAA certifies that the proposed regulation, if adopted, will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required under the terms oftheRFA .

The authority for this program is contained in section 2(b) of the Act of August 4,1965, as amended (7 U.S.C. 450i(b)). Under this program, subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary may award competitive research grants, for periods not to exceed five years, for the support of research projects to further the programs of the Department of Agriculture. Proposals may be submitt\u00ebd by any State agricultural experiment station, college, university, other research institution or organization, Federal agency, private organization, corporation, or individual. Proposals for scientists at non-United States organizations will not be considered for support. Application Regulations Regulations applicable to this program include the following: (a) The regulations governing the Competitive Research Grants Program, 7 CFR Part 3200 (49 FR 5570, February 13,1984, as amended by 50 FR 5499, February 8, 1985), which set forth procedures to be followed when submitting grant proposals, rules governing the evaluation of proposals and the awarding of grants, and regulations relating to the post-award administration of grant projects; and (b) the USDA Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations, 7 CFR Part 3015, as amended. Specific Research Areas To Be Supported in Fiscal Year 1988 Standard project grants and a small number of continuation grants will be awarded to support basic research in selected areas of the biological sciences related to agriculture and human nutrition. The Competitive Research Grants Program covers the following categories: Plant Science Human Nutrition Animal Science Biotechnology The research categories of plant and animal science and human nutrition have been considered by a number ofscientific groups to possess exceptional opportunity for fundamental scientific discovery and for contributing, in the long run, to applied research and development vitally needed on high- priority food and nutrition problems. The major initiative in biotechnology research that began in fiscal year 1985 will continue for fiscal year 1988. It is designed to provide opportunities to address research problems in all categories of agricultural science including plants, animals, insect pests, and microorganisms associated with these biota. It is anticipated that this research will advance broadly the Nations competitive advantages in the food, feed, fiber and natural resource processes. Consideration will be given to research proposals that address fundamental questions in the areas noted below and that are consistent with the long-range agricultural needs of the Nation. If you intend to submit a Biotechnology proposal, it should be submitted to one of the research program areas listed below where the subject matter is most appropriate. While basic guidelines are provided to assist members of the scientific community in assessing their interest in the program areas and to delineate certain important areas where new information is needed, the guidelines are not meant to provide boundaries or to detract from the creativity of potential applicants. USDA encourages the submission of innovative projects in the so-called\" high-risk\" category as well as those that may have a more certain payoff potential. In all instances, innovative research will be given high priority. Agriculturally important organism(s) should be used to accomplish the research objectives. The use of other organisms as experimental model systems must be justified relative to the goals of the appropriate research program area and to the long-term objectives of USDA. Workshops or symposia that bring together scientists to identify research needs, update information, or advance an area of research are recognized as integral parts of research efforts. Support for a limited number of such meetings covering subject matter encompassed by this Competitive Research Grants solicitation will be Considered. Individuals who have recently received a doctoral degree and wish to have further research experience before embarking on an independent career may submit proposals describing the research they wish to perform related to the program areas described in this solicitation.To be considered for funding during fiscal year 1988, proposals from these individuals must be postmarked according to the dates established in this solicitation. Interested individuals should contact the appropriate program staff for further information. The following specific research areas (program areas) and guidelines are provided as a base from which proposals may be developed: 1.0 Plant Biological Stress Including M olecular Plant Pathology, W eed S cien ce, Entom ology a nd Nematology. Plants are exposed to many stresses that may adversely affect their productivity and usefulness to man. This program area will support research on stresses on plants arising from their interactions with other plants or other biological agents and their control agents such as weeds, insects, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, viruses, and mycoplasma-like organisms. The ultimate goal of the research supported in this area is to reduce losses in plant productivity from damage caused by biologically generated stresses. This program area will emphasize studies that enhance our understanding of (a) how stressful interactions are established between plants and other biological agents; (b) how plants react to stresses generated by interactions with biological agents; and (e) how damage from such interactions may be reduced or eliminated. The interactions may be studied at any number of levels (i.e., population, organismal, cellular, and molecular) and by various approaches including genetics, molecular hiology, and biochemistry. Within this context, one of the goals of this program area is to understand the molecular basis for the organisms response to these stresses and to identify which of the genetic or cellular systems involved in these responses can be manipulated by techniques in biotechnology. Research on plants, plant-associated insects or microorganisms should emphasize: (a) Identification, isolation, transfer, regulation, and expression of genes involved in biological stresses; (b) physiological/biochemical-genetic analyses of identified genes or gene products involved in biological stress; and (c) fundamental or molecular mechanisms underlying Stress responses, injury, tol\u00e9rance, resistance, and avoidance at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. Proposals may include studies on plants separated from stress-causing organisms or on stress-causing organisms separated from their target plants. However, proposals should Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / N otices29483 indicate how the anticipated information will be relevant to an understanding of the causes, consequences, and avoidance of biologically generated stresses on plants. The research supported in this program area will focus on the identification of new approaches that will be both effective and compatible with social and environmental concerns. To expedite processing and review of the large number of proposals submitted in the broad subject area of Plant Biological Stress, proposals will be evaluated under two subprogram areas: 1.1 Plant P ath o lo g y /W eed S cien ce and 1.2. E ntom ology/N em o tology, each of which will have a separate deadline date for submission of proposals. Within the guidelines described above, the Plant Pathology/Weed Science subprogram area will consider all proposals for research addressing plant pathogens or weeds affecting plant stress. The Entomology/Nematology subprogram area will consider all proposals for research addressing arthropods or nematodes stressing the plant. * 2.0 P lant G en etic M echan ism s an d Plant M olecu lar B iology. The goal of this program area is to encourage new approaches for the development of genetically superior varieties of agricultural crops. Proposals should be directed toward obtaining novel combinations or gene modifications. One of the major limiting factors for the application of biotechnology to agriculture is the lack of basic information about genes. Studies addressing the basic cellular, molecular, and genetic processes which contribute new information required for the development of novel approaches to crop improvement will be given high priority. This research should increase our understanding of the structure, function, regulation, and expression of genes. This program area will emphasize the following but will not exclude other new or unusual approaches to crop improvement: (a) Identification, isolation, and characterization of genes and gene products; (b) relationships between gene structure and function; (c) regulatory mechanisms of gene expression; (d) interactions between nuclear and organellar genes, arid between extrachromosomal and chromosomal genes; (e) mechanisms of gene recombination and transposition; (f) molecular basis of chromosomal replication; (g) cell and tissue culture studies designed to increase our knowledge of the basic molecular, biochemical, and cellular processes involved in regenerating whole plantsfrom single cells; (h) development of cellular and molecular methods for identifying plant characteristics or genes which are important targets for genetic manipulation; (i) development-of molecular and cellularmethods lo r crop improvement using gene transfer or genetic engineering technology; {}) development of new methods for producing, selecting, and transferring agronomically important qualitative and quantitative traits; and (k) basic genetic studies on the alteration and utilization of unadapted and wild germplasm. 3.0 B io lo g ica l N itrogen F ixation an d M etabolism . The most common limiting nutrient for plant growth is nitrogen. The presence of soil nitrogen is due to past accretions in nature, biological nitrogen fixation, or the application of . nitrogenous fertilizer. The latter represents a significant energy input in cropping and ultimately increases food costs. Thus, the enhancement of biological nitrogen fixation capacity in plant-soil microbial associations is of major importance. Research aimed at understanding nitrogen-fixing mechanisms and related nitrogen metabolism in both symbiotic and free- living organisms as well as the fate of fixed nitrogen in the plant is of high priority. In general, the objectives of this program area include building a foundation of basic information concerning nitrogen fixation as it relates to enhancing the process in currently known systems and in providing a base for developing new nitrogen-fixing associations, by genetic transfer or other means, for crop species not now possessing such capability. Moreover, the process of nitrification, the assimilation and utilization of ammonia and nitrate, and denitrification all play important roles in plant growth. Examples of research encompassed in this program area include: (a) Structure and mechanism of action of nitrogenase; the regulation of nitrogenase activity and synthesis; the relatioriship nitrogenase and hydrogenase activities in nitrogen-fixing organisms; (b) energetics of the nitrogen fixation process including competitive processes within the plant; (c) infection by R hizobium and conditions for effective nodulation; basis of the recognition process between syiribi\u00f4tic organisms; factors controlling syriibiont specificity; competition in spp., Cyanobacteria, and other organisins potentially important in supplying nitrogen needs of plants; (e) relation between the fixation process and the processes of assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; |f)development of methods for the in situ ' measurement of nitrification and denitrification and determination of the actual extent of these processes in nature; (g] analysis of the distribution of denitrifying and nitrifying bacteria and elucidation of control mechanisms operating on nitrogen transformations in the major species; (h) metabolism of fiked'nitrogen including the enzymes involved iri the assimilation and dissimilation of fixed nitrogen iri bacteria and crop plants and the partitioning o f fixed nitrogen into various gene products or plant organs; > and (i) efficiency of nitrogen utilization by crop plants in the production of food proteins. Emphasis in program priorities will be on innovative approaches which may contribute to a more thorough understanding of nitrogen cycling encompassing biochemistry, molecular biology, cellular and developmental biology, genetics and genetic manipulation, arid other relevant fife science disciplines iricluding suitable techniques of biotechnology. An understanding of these processes is essential to the devlopment of strategies which maximize nitrogen fixation, minimize inputs of nitrogenous fertilizers, and optimize theif utilization in agriculture. 4.0 P hotosyn thesis. Photosynthetic . efficiency is an important factor in crop productivity. Basic research which provides information on limiting processes of photosynthesis and associated carbon metabolism will lead to a greater understanding of those factors which affect the ability of the plant to produce a usable product. Research is needed in the followirig major subareas: (a) Genetic and cellular manipulation to improve photosynthetic efficiency in plants including studies of the chloroplast and nuclear genomes, analyses of regulatory steps controlling both nuclear and extra-nuclear photosynthetic gene expression and their interactions; (b) aspects of photosynthetic energy conversion, including such areas as early events in photon capture by photosynthetic systems arid the mechanisms of charge . separation, the structure and function of photosynthetic membranes and membrarie constituents, and the associated chemical and physical reactions; (c) photosynthetic carbon assimilation including mechanisms of CO2 fixation, biochemistry and biology of photosynthetic and related biosynthetic pathways, photorespiration, arid aspects of cellular metabolism regulating these reactions; ? (d) control q photo-synthate partitioning, 29484Federal Register / Voi. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987^/^Jotices^ translocation, and utilization; (e) factors controlling development and senescence of the photosynthetic apparatus; and (f) photosynthetic process in leaves, whole plants, and canopies including, but not limited to, involvement of the stomatal apparatus. Other research designed to generate new information leading to a basic understanding of photosynthesis and its accompanying processes also may be considered a part of this program. 5.0 M olecu lar an d C ellu lar M echan ism s o f P lant G row th an d D evelopm ent. Suboptimal growth and development are limiting factors in plant productivity. A basic understanding of the developmental processes in agriculturally important plants is largely lacking, but new experimental approaches are being developed through advances in molecular and cellular biology. The goal of this program area is to encourage the use of emerging techniques for the investigation of the developmental processes, as well as to increase fundamental knowledge that will provide a basis for biotechnological manipulation of plant growth and development. This research area will place emphasis on, but not be limited to, studies of (a) cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling growth and developmental processes, including reproduction, differentiation, and senescence; and (b) metabolic processes related to growth and development. Projects designed to identify molecular, cellular, and organismal targets for genome manipulation also are encouraged. 6.0 G en etic an d M olecu lar M echan ism s C ontrolling P lant R esp on ses to P h y sica l an d E nvironm ental A b iotic S tresses. Physical stresses prevent the expression of the full genetic potential of an organism's productivity and set limits on where and when it thrives. A major goal of this program area is to understand the molecular and cellular bases for the organism's responses to these abiotic stresses and to identify which of the genetic systems involved in these responses can be manipulated. Research on plants should emphasize: (a) Identification, isolation, transfer, and expression of genes that are regulated by, or involved in, stresses; (b) physiological-genetic and biochemical- genetic analyses of identified genes or genomic segments that are likely to affect performance under stress; (c) molecular mechanisms underlying coordination of organismal responses to stress; (d) fundamental mechanisms of stress responses, injury, tolerance, and avoidance at the molecular, cellular, andorganismal levels; and (e) laboratory and field investigations on the physiology of the organism that contribute to an understanding of the causes, consequences, and avoidance of stresses, rather than simply describing the effects of stress. 7.0 Human Nutrition. Proposals are invited in the area of human requirements for nutrients. Support will not be provided for clinical research, demonstration or action projects, nor for surveys of the nutritional status of population groups. Research in this program area is intended to contribute to the improvement of human nutritional status by increasing our understanding of requirements for nutrients. The objective is to support basic, creative research that will help to fill gaps in our knowledge about nutrient requirements, bioavailability, the interrelationships of nutrients, and the nutritional value of foods that are consumed in the U.S. and of the nutrient condition of healthy individuals, as all of these relate to human nutrient requirements. Special attention will be given to applications involving innovative approaches designed to improve methods of research and investigation that will increase the reliability and validity of data concerned with the quantitative evaluation of nutrient requirements and nutrient condition. Studies of the biochemical and molecular basis for nutrient requirements are encouraged, answering questions as to why a particular nutrient is required, and what its function is in the cell. Also, studies of the molecular biology of factors interacting with nutrients, such as receptors, carrier proteins and binding proteins\u00bb are encouraged. The use of animals as model systems should be justified. Proposals dealing with processing techniques in food technology should be clearly oriented toward determination of human nutrient requirements. Proposals which concern utilization or production of a food commodity should emphasize the relationship to specific human nutrient requirements. It is especially important that proposals emphasize innovative, fundamental research. 8.0 A nim al S cien ce (R eprodu ctive P hysiology). Suboptimal reproductive performance in domestic farm animals is the major factor limiting more efficient production of animal food products. This failure to achieve maximal reproductive efficiency is due to problems related to puberty, ovulation, corpus luteum formation and function, insemination, fertilization, prenatal death, and poor survival of offspring.The economic loss to the producer and increased costs of animal food products to the consumer due to inefficient reproductive performance makes the requirement for new knowledge in this area a high priority. Although the exact needs may vary from species to species and region to region, there are areas where additional fundamental research is crucial. This program area will support innovative research in the following categories: (a) Mechanisms affecting embryo survival, endocrinological control of embryo development, mechanisms of embryomaternal interactions, and embryo implantation; (b) gamete physiology, primarily gametogenesis including maturation processes, follicle growth, ovulation, corpus luteum formation and function, and superovulation; fundamental processes of fertilization, mechanisms regulating gamete survival in vitro, and basic questions regarding gamete transport; and (c) parturition, postpartum interval to conception, and neonatal survival. Emphasis will be on innovative approaches which may contribute to a thorough understanding of the reproductive processes in animals primarily raised for food and fiber production. The use of experimental model systems should be justified relative to the objectives of this research. Proposals on the development of methods for in vitro manipulation and preservation of animal gametes and embryos will be considered, but overall objectives of such studies should be related to the development of fundamental knowledge. 9.0 A nim al M olecu lar B iology. One of the major limiting factors for the application of biotechnology to agriculture is the lack of basic information about genes. The primary objective of this program area is to increase our understanding of the structure, organization, function, regulation, and expression of genes in animals and their associated infectious agents and microorganisms. This program area will emphasize the following categories of research: (1) Identification, isolation, characterization, and expression of genes and gene products; (b) relationships between gene structure and function; (c) regulatory mechanisms of gene expression; (d) interactions between nuclear and organellar genes, and between extrachromosomal and chromosomal genes; (e) mechanisms of gene recombination and transposition; (f) molecular basis of chromosomal 29485 Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / Notices replication; and (g) mechanisms of interaction with beneficial or deleterious microorganisms or infectious agents. The program encourages additional basic research directed toward understanding the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling animal responses to physical and biological stresses. Topics include the organism's interaction with the stresses and identification of the genetic systems involved in the interaction that can be manipulated through molecular genetic techniques. Research may emphasize (a) identification, isolation, transfer, and expression of genes or gene systems that are regulated by, or involved in, stress; (b) biochemical genetic analysis of genome segments that are likely to affect performance under stress; (c) molecular mechanisms underlying coordination of organismal responses to stress; and (d) fundamental mechanisms of stress responses at the molecular level.; . - * 10.0 M olecu lar a n d C ellu lar M echanism s o f A n im al G row th an d D evelopm ent Suboptimal growth and development are limiting factors in animal productivity.

Renewal proposals should include a clearly identified progress report and any reprints or preprints of publications resulting from the funded research. Resubmissions of unsuccessful proposals should clearly indicate what changes have been made in the proposal. Each copy of each proposal must include a Form CSRS-661, \"Grant Application,\" which is included in the Grant Application Kit. Proposers should note that one copy of this form, preferably the original, must contain pen-and-ink signatures of the principal investigator(s) and the authorized organizational representative. Each project description is expected by the members of review committees and thestaff to be complete iri itself. It should be noted that reviewers are not required to read beyond 15 pages of the project description to evaluate the proposal. Proposals beyond this limit are therefore subject to non-review and return. It would be helpful for reviewers if the vitae of key project personnel were limited to three (3) or four (4) pages. All copies of \u00e0 proposal must be mailed in one package. Due to the ------ -- volume of proposals received, proposals submitted in several packages are very difficult to identify. Also, please see that each copy of each proposal is sta p led secu rely in the upper left-hand comer. DO NOT BIND. Information should be typed on one side of the page only. Every effort should be made to ensure that the p ro p o sa l con tain s a ll p ertin en t in form ation w hen in itia lly subm itted. Prior to mailing, compare your proposal with the \" Application Requirements\" checklist contained in the Grant Application Kit and instructions contained in the regulations governing the Competitive Research Grants Program, 7 CFR Part 3200. Applicants must not submit the same research proposal in the same fiscal year to different research program areas within the Competitive Research Grants Program and all of the CSRS Special Grants Programs. Duplicate proposals, essentially duplicate proposals, or predominantly overlappping proposals will be returned without review. Submission of more than one proposal from the same principal investigator in the same fiscal year is strongly discouraged. Excessive numbers of co-principal investigators and collaborators create conflicts of interest problems during the review and award processes. Multiple co-principal investigators and collaborators, beyond those required for genuine multidisciplinary studies, are strongly discouraged.

SUMMARY: This notice contains a list of all HUD programs by Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Number that are subject, in whole or in part, to the intergovernmental review process under 24 CFR Part 52 and a list of those programs that are not subject to Part 52. It also indicates, for certain programs, the specific activities that are subject to the intergovernmental review process. This notice updates the lists that were published on February 13,1987, at 52 FR 4754 by changing the program coverage for CFDA No. 14.852, Comprehensive . Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP). It also adds CFDA No. 14.231, Emergency Shelter Grants Program to Table I (programs subject to Part 52). This Program is subject to Part 52 to the extent that it involves reallocations of grants for site-specific applications involving major rehabilitation of, or conversion of buildings to, emergency shelters. CFDA No. 14.178, Transitional Housing Demonstration Program, is added to Table II (programs not subject to Part 52). EFFECTIVE D A TE : August 7, 1987. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION C O N TA C T: Dr. Drew Allbritten, Executive Assistant to the Deputy Under Secretary for Intergovernmental Relations, Room 10184, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, DC 20410. Telephone (202) 755-6732. (This is not a toll-free number). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In accordance with 24 CfR 52.3, on February 13,1987, the Department published at 52 FR 4754, the lists of HUD programs subject to the intergovernmental review procedures in 24 CFR Part 52 and of HUD programs not subject to Part 52. Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP) In the February 13,1987, notice the Department also proposed an additional change in program coverage with respect to CFDA No. 14.852,Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program. CIAP was then subject to the intergovernmental review procedures under Part 52 without any express limitations on coverage. Because much of the work performed under the various modernization programs under CIAP clearly does not directly affect State and local governments, the Department proposed to limit the applicability of the Part 52 procedures to CIAP to circumstances similar to those that apply to the other assisted housing programs. HUD proposed that a CIAP application would be subject to the Part 52 procedures only if it involves substantial rehabilitation and involves: (1) a change in the use of land; (2) an increase in project density; or (3) a change from rental to homeownership. The Department received one public comment on this proposed change. The commenter, a Public Housing Agency, recommended that all CIAP activities be excluded from the Part 52 procedures on the ground that, even without these procedures, a State or local government could disapprove any of the three types of activities listed above through denial of building permits, zoning restrictions, local ordinances, or State law. There is no basis under Executive Order 12372 or the OMB guidelines, however, to exclude a program because a State or local government may have its own authority to regulate the activity. The intergovernmental review procedures are intended to provide an opportunity for State and local governments, acting through a State process, to have their comments considered by a Federal agency that is carrying out an activity that may have a direct effect on them. The Department believes that its proposed coverage for CIAP provides State and local-governments the opportunity to comment on those CIAP activities that could have a direct effect on them and is, therefore, revising the CIAP coverage as proposed. Transitional Housing Demonstration and Emergency Shelter Grants Programs Section 101(g), Pub. L. 99-500 (approved October 18,1986), and Pub, L. 99-591 (approved October 30,1986), making appropriations as provided in H.R. 5313,99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986), authorized two new programs to assist the homeless\u2014the Transitional Housing Demonstration Program and the Emergency Shelter Grants Program. The Department published a notice of proposed guidelines for the Transitional Housing Demonstration Program on February 25,1987, at 52 FR 5587. This notice sought public comment (due April 14,1987) on the proposedimplementation of this program. Section 5. (viii) of the notice (52 FR at 5597) stated that the Department proposed to exclude this Program under the OMB criterion that permits exclusion of research and development programs. The Department did not receive any comments concerning the proposed exclusion of the Transitional Housing Demonstration Program. Notice of final guidelines was published on June 9, 1987, (52 FR 21743), which states in section 6. (viii) that 24 CFR Part 52 does not apply to applications under this Program. This notice, accordingly, lists CFDA No. 14.178, Transitional Housing Demonstration Program, in Table II, HUD Programs Not Subject to 24 CFR Part 52. On December 17,1986, the Department published a proposed rule and program requirements for fiscal year 1987 (51 FR 45278, comments due February 17,1987), which, in accordance with the statutory mandate, both sought public comment to develop a final effective rule and provided the requirements for the immediate implementation of the Emergency Shelter Grants Program. This document did not expressly address the Part 52 procedures, but implemented the Program without providing for intergovernmental review. One commenter on the Emergency Shelter Grants Program proposed rule noted the omission of any reference to Part 52 procedures. The Department has added CFDA No. 14.231, Emergency Shelter Grants Program to Table I, HUD Programs Subject to 24 CFR Part 52. Only an application, however, that (1) involves a reallocation of grant amounts to a grantee, (2) involves the major rehabilitation of an emergency shelter or conversion of a building to an emergency shelter, and (3) is site specific is subject to Part 52. The Emergency Shelter Grants Program provides broad discretion for a grantee to determine the specific use for the grant within statutorily created categories of eligible activities. HUD does not normally review specific sites, but considers a general Homeless Assistance Plan. Indeed, emergency shelter grants initially are allocated by a formula that is based on the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Entitlement and States Program allocation. These emergency shelter grants, as do the CDBG entitlement grants, clearly fall within the OMB exclusion for financial transfers over which the Federal agency has no funding discretion or authority to approve specific sites or projects. HUD, Federal Register / Vol. 52, No. 152 / Friday, August 7, 1987 / N otices 29489 \u00a1however, also may reallocate grant [amounts that are returned or unused. \u00a1These reallpcations are made on a review of Homeless Assistance Plans \u00a1and do not normally involve HUD approval of specific sites. A 'reallocation, therefore, is normally a financial transfer with the grantee retaining ultimate decisionmaking authority for the specific use of the grant and is not subject to Part 52. The Department, however, will subject those applications to the intergovernmental review process when HUD is considering site specific applications that could directly affect State and local governments, namely, conversion of a building to an emergency shelter or major rehabilitation of an emergency shelter. These limitations on program coverage are comparable to the existing limitations on program coverage for the Department's multifamily insurance programs and assisted housing programs. Description of Tables of Programs To aid the reader, this notice contains all HUD programs currently listed in theCatalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. Table I contains a list of all HUD programs that are subject, in whole or in . part, to Part 52. Related programs are listed together and limitations on program coverage are identified. Table II contains a list of all HUD programs that are completely excluded from Part 52 intergovernmental procedures. The programs are listed by Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number. Please note that because a program is listed in Table I does not necessarily mean that a particular State has selected the program to be covered by the State's intergovernmental review process. Interested parties should contact the appropriate State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) to determine whether a program listed in Table I has been selected by that State for intergovernmental review. Finding A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the Ho u s in g \u2014 F e d e r a l Ho u s i n g Co m m is s io n e rNational Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C. 4332.
