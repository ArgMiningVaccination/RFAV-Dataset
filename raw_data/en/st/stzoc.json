Insight Anthroposophy is a discipline of research as well as a path of knowledge, service, personal growth, and social engagement. The word \"anthroposophy\" means \"wisdom of the human being,\" or, for us today, \"awareness of one's humanity.\" It was introduced and developed by the philosopher, scientist, and Goethe scholar Rudolf Steiner as a \"science of the spirit.\" Anthroposophy is concerned with all aspects of human life and spirit, as well as humanity's future evolution and well-being.

It is a kind of schooling which leads to concrete experience of the spiritual dimensions of the human being and the world. A path of inner development, Christ-centered at its esoteric core, its fruits are visible in art, social forms, and practical enterprises. Over time, about 10,000 institutions and initiatives have been founded that endeavor to apply anthroposophy.

ANTHROPOSOPHY (noun) [an-thro-POS-o-phy] The art and science of becoming more fully human. Rudolf Steiner was born on February 27, 1861 in what is now Croatia and died on March 30, 1925 in Dornach, Switzerland. His monumental achievements of drafting an alternative science, a new pedagogy, new perspectives in medicine and agriculture, and new forms of expression in both the visual and performing arts, have entered into the spiritual heritage of the present time. They live in today's cultural life as an impulse and an inspiration. \"Anthroposophy does not want to impart knowledge.
