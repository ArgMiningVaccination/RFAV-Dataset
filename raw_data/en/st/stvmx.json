Everyone is susceptible to colds and flu. Children and the elderly are more likely to and more often to catch a cold or flu. People with conditions such as diabetes, emphysema, and other chronic diseases, and those who take immune supressing drugs are more vulnerable as well.

Specifically, the throat, is a gateway for both the digestive and respiratory systems, it is easily exposed to allergens, bacteria and irritants which is why we typically see a common cold begin with a sore throat and coughing and sneezing. A person or child in good health should recover from the common cold within 7-10 days. However, for those with pre-existing illnesses, they may be susceptible to complications. For people with asthma, emphysema and other chronic disorders a common cold can lead to complications such as asthma attacks, sinusitis, ear infections and other secondary infections like bronchitis and pneumonia. With influenza, the symptoms are the same as common cold symptoms, except they come on faster and are more severe. They are also accompanied by fatigue, muscle aches and fever. Most people require more time and treatment to recover from a flu; this usually includes lots of rest and proper medication.
