The No Action Alternative is described in Section 2.1, the characteristics of the Proposed Action\u2014the siting, construction, and operation of the NBAF\u2014that may have impacts on the affected environment are described in Section 2.2. Section 2.3 describes the development of and the reasonable site alternatives. Section 2.4 describes the alternatives considered but eliminated from detailed study. Section 2.5 provides a summary comparison of the potential environmental impacts associ ated with the proposed construction and operation of the NBAF. Section 2.6 discusses the Preferred Altern ative that will be presented in the Final EIS. 2.1 N O ACTION ALTERNATIVE Under the No Action Alternative, the NBAF would not be constructed. The work currently being conducted at PIADC, which performs much of the research on FADs and zoonotic diseases in the U.S., would continue and BSL-4 research would continue to be performed out side of the U.S. If the No Action Alternative is selected, PIADC would continue ope rations and support existing research programs but not the expanded mission requirements associated with the NBAF. In other words, the No Action Alternative would not meet the purpose and need for the Proposed Action. 2.2 P ROPOSED ACTION : REQUIREMENTS TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE THE NBAF The NBAF Conceptual Design and Feasibility Study (NDP 2007a) described the programmatic, technical, and non-site-specific requirements for the NBAF to determ ine the feasibility of the project and to prepare a preliminary conceptual design. Based on that docum ent and other sources as noted, a description of the construction and operation of the NBAF has been developed for the purposes of analyzing the potential environmental impacts associated with those activities. 2.2.1 Construction Requirements The study emphasized that the NBAF should be located on a site of no less than 30 acres to include a main laboratory building, a current good manufacturing prac tice (cGMP) laboratory (needed for small-scale vaccine and reagent production), a central receiving facility, a guard house, and a central utility plant (CUP). The approximate area needed for the NBAF is between 500,000 and 520,000 square feet. The approximate percentage of the facility by compone nt is provided in Table 2.2.1-1. Table 2.2.1-1 \u2014 NBAF Space Requirements Space Percent of Total Area Office/Administration 6.9 BSL-2a 6.0 BSL-3b 73.8 BSL-4 10.9 cGMP 2.4 aBSL-2 includes laboratory and support areas. bBSL-3 includes laboratory, 3Ag, and training and support areas. The number and size of research laboratories were determined in part by the magnitude of the research that was to be conducted in the facility. Animal species, FAD and zoonotic agents, and transmission modes of each agent were important considerations in developing many of the design requirements and safety features of the NBAF and are presented in Table 2.2.1-2. Based on 70% utilization of the design maximum, projected research demands resulted in a facility design that could house approximately 200 to 300 animals at any given time, including cattle, swine, and sheep. June 2008 2-1 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement Table 2.2.1-2 \u2014 FAD and Zoonotic Agents Characteristics BMBL/APHIS Classification Agent Laboratory Animal Species Mode of Transmission Foot and Mouth Disease virus BSL-3E BSL-3Ag Cattle, sheep, swine, goats, deer, and other cloven-hoofed animals Aerosol, contact Classical swine fever virus BSL-3E BSL-3Ag Swine Oral, contact Vesicular stomatitis viruses BSL-3E BSL-3Ag Horses, swine, cattle Biting flies, oral Rift Valley fever virus BSL-3E BSL-3Ag Sheep, goats, cattle, fever virus BSL-3E BSL-3Ag Swine Ticks The NBAF would consist of two laboratory faciliti es and two outbuildings. One of the two laboratory buildings would be the primary research building c ontaining the BSL-2, BSL-3E, BSL-3Ag, and BSL-4 laboratories with their associated support spaces. The other laboratory building would be a cGMP laboratory located adjacent to the primary research laboratory. Other outbuildings supporting the overall operation of the NBAF would include: Entry Guard House - Controls site access. Central Receiving Facility - Controls all deliveries to the site for transfer to the laboratory facilities; all external vehicle deliveries would be transferre d to the NBAF internal vehicles for delivery. Parking - General surface parking for staff and visitors. An interagency technical working group of experts and researchers from DHS, USDA, and DHHS determined that the program missions of biodefense and agro-d efense required the following research capacities within the proposed laboratory facilities: Nine BSL-3Ag and two BSL-4 modules to c onduct two BSL-4 agro- countermeasure research and devel opment programs simultaneously. Supporting core laboratory pathology and analytical chemistry modules that would include electron microscopic and other imaging capabilities, a gamma irradiator to inactivate samples for shipment outside of biocontainment, and two BSL-2 laboratorie s to perform molecular experiments that do not require biocontainment facilities. Supporting laboratory modules to include insectary spaces necessary to support the research. The BSL-2 insectary is for the combined functions of breeding, rearing, manipulating, and holding/incubating of arthropod vectors used in the research programs. Other insectary research spaces within BSL-3E and BSL-3Ag would be used for holding infected live insects or arthropods and for virus transmission studies to and from both infected and non-infected large animals and small animals. A module to train veterinarians to recognize a nd diagnose FADs, which is one of the primary missions of Animal and Plant Health Inspection Se rvice (APHIS). The proposed facility needs to have a modern infrastructure to accomplish this mission, including a distance learning capability. The training module would opera te independently of the research operations but within the June 2008 2-2 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement containment confines, permitting the courses to oper ate anytime during the year and allow separate security requirements and practices of the research facility. A cGMP module is needed for small-scale vacc ine and reagent production. For large-scale manufacturing an industry partner would be need ed. The cGMP module would allow for production and testing of two vaccine candidates at any give n time. Modular components (BSL-2) would include a viral production room, a vaccine sterile assembly and fill room, a vaccine lyophilization area, and a diagnostic reagent production room. In addition to the components described, infrastructur e improvements would be required depending on where the site would be located. These improvements would in clude new power substations; new or higher capacity water, sewer, and natural gas lines; sanitary sewer upgrades; or new access roads or service lanes. 2.2.1.1 Biosafety Design According to the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (CDC and NIH 2007), \"the fundamental principles of biosafety are contai nment and risk assessment. The fundamentals of containment include the microbiological practices, safe ty equipment, and facility safeguards that protect laboratory workers, the environment, and the public fr om exposure to infectious microorganisms that are handled and stored in the laboratory. Risk assessment is the process that enables the appropriate selection of microbiological practices, safety equipment, and facility safeguards that can prevent laboratory-associated infections (LAI) .\" The proposed NBAF would provide state-of-the-art operating procedures and biocontainment features to minimize the potential for LAIs and accidental release from the research laboratories (see Appendix B for a review of biocontainment laboratory safety). One of the primary design goals central to the flexibility of the proposed main laboratory building was the \"hotel concept.\" This concept was used to evaluate and determine the number of laboratories and animal rooms required to run the NBAF in a safe, cost-effec tive, and efficient manner. This hotel concept assumes that all rooms are designed and shared on an equa l basis and that each room provides the primary biocontainment requirements to ensure isolation between each other. Primary biocontainment measures for the proposed NBAF would include, but are not limited to , high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration for air exhaust and air intake systems, biosafety cabinets (BSCs), pressurized biosafety suits, and decontamination stations. Safety and biocontainment protocols would be addressed in facility-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) that would be developed according to USDA guidelines prior to commissioning and operation of the NBAF. Another primary design goal was to provide an adequa te level of redundant safety and biocontainment that would be integrated into every component of the build ing. All laboratory areas, animal areas, support areas, backup computer servers, and engineering systems would have 100% back-up and redundancy such as: Each critical zone would be designed as a sealed \" box-within-a-box\" with airlocks at all points of access. The hardened structural systems would mitigate progressive collapse to help withstand seismic and or other external threats. The electrical systems would have dual feeds and woul d be designed with fully integrated battery and diesel-electric power back-up systems for redu ndancy within each system. A power outage or component breakdown would instantly transfer function to a back-up system. BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 laboratori es would have two HEPA filters installed in series. Heating and ventilation systems woul d be fully contained with each zone, have seamless access to back-up power, and have redundant compone nts built into every critical system. Concentric-ring security zones would ensure that not hing enters or exits the building without passing multiple points of physical and electronic screening. June 2008 2-3 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement The facility functions serving our natio nal security concerns would have multiple layers of security designed into every primary use and engineering support systems. This level of safety, redundancy, and security would help to provide instant and automatic safeguards to the staff and the community it serves to support the overarching design goal of providing a safe work environment. 2.2.1.2 Construction Schedule and Activities Construction of the proposed NBAF would start in earl y 2010 and take approximately 4 years to complete. The project would provide approximately 700 construction-related jobs per year. A detailed description of construction activities would be prepared once a site has been selected. However, the effects of construction activities on the various res ources have been considered in this DEIS based on assumptions derived from the NBAF Conceptual Design and Feasibility Study and other sources . The details of those assumptions are presented in Chapter 3 for each site alternative. In all likelihood, the construction manager at risk or construction manager as c onstructor (CMc) methodology would be employed for construction operations. This is a proven process where the CMc functions as a collaborative member of the project team and would be responsible for providing expertise during the design process by checking estimates and performing constructa bility reviews. All work would be performed in accordance with good management practices and in accordan ce with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. All work woul d be planned and managed to ensure that standard worker safety goals are met. Construction of the proposed NBAF woul d be performed using appr oved construction industry methods. During site preparation and construction, noise levels would be consiste nt with standard office building construction activities. Vehicles (such as dum p trucks) and heavy machinery (such as bulldozers, dump trucks, cranes, and cement mixer trucks) would be used onsite during the construction phase. These vehicles would operate primarily during daylight hours. If needed, temporary task lighting would be used. Engineering best management practices (BMPs) would be implemented at the building site as part of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) executed under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System construction permit. These BMPs may include the use of hay bales, plywood, or synthetic sedimentation fences with appropriate supports installed to contain excavated soil and surface water discharge during construction of the proposed NBAF. During construction, good housekeeping practices would be followed. Construction materials would include inert building materials such as concrete, glass, masonr y, wood, insulation, plastics, sheetrock, and metal beams and piping. These materials would be stored n eatly within designated staging areas. Construction would also require the use of some chemicals such as paints, solvents, fertilizer s, oil, grease, fuel, and welding gases. These chemicals would be stored in prot ected areas. During construction, the manufacturer's recommendations for proper use and disposal would be followed for chemicals and materials. Whenever possible, all of a product would be used before dispos ing of the container. Equipment maintenance and repair would be conducted in designated areas to control oil, grease, and fuel spills. In addition, fuel storage and dispensing during construction would occur in a d esignated staging area at the construction site. Wastes generated by site preparation and construction activities are expected to be predominately non-hazardous. After construction of the facility, site soil a nd rock removed during cons truction would be returned and used as landscaping to the degree that it is practicable. Landscaping would use native trees, shrubs, and groundcover. Sustainable building practices would be employed where safety allows. 2.2.2 Operation of the Proposed NBAF The proposed NBAF would be either a government owned-government operated (GOGO) or government owned-contractor operated (GOCO) facility. A GOCO part nership allows each part ner to perform duties for which it is uniquely suited: the government establis hes mission areas and the private sector implements the missions using best business practices. The GOCO mode l has been replicated many times over the past 50 June 2008 2-4 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement years, primarily by the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies. In the U.S., GOCO arrangements are used to manage laboratories, manufacturing a nd production plants, and numer ous repositories. Sandia National Laboratories, originally managed by AT&T, has been managed by Lockheed Martin since 1993. In addition, the DHS National Biodefense Analysis a nd Countermeasures Center (NBACC) currently under construction at Fort Detrick, which will have BSL-2, BSL-3, and BSL-4 laboratories, will be operated as a GOCO facility. A program management plan (PMP) h as been prepared to insu re DHS management and supervision of activities at the NBACC. If it is deci ded that the NBAF would be GOCO, a PMP would be prepared for the facility. If the Proposed Action is selected and the Record of Decision (ROD) is signed, DHS would develop site-specific SOPs for the NBAF. These SOPs would be m odified as necessary for the specific requirements of the proposed NBAF at the selected site. The following sections present an overview of staffing, protocols for laboratory research and sample transportation, and a description of operations for the proposed NBAF. Prior to conducting research with highly infectious agents, a laboratory facility and staff undergo many pre-operational testing and training activities. One of the first pre-operational test and training events to occur is the commissioning of a laboratory. The commissioning process for building construction projects is a quality control process to document, test, and verify that building systems meet the f acility owner's functional, operational, and performance requirements. This pr ocess is essential in the construction of today's biocontainment laboratories due to the requirements fo r life safety and reliable environmental control and monitoring. To take full advantage of the commission ing process, the research and maintenance staff would actively participate with the commissioning team to lear n how the variety of engineering systems and controls maintain the integrity of the biocontainment laboratory. The research and maintenance staff would draw upon this information to establish the SOPs for each staffing group. Once the construction of the facility and commissioning is complete, the maintenance staff would establish the operations and maintenance SOPs based on the data compiled from the construction documents, commissioning process, regulatory agencies, and thei r own experience with simulated system failure scenarios. These scenarios would occur during the co mmissioning process to help prepare the maintenance and research staff to respond in a timely and eff ective manner should the failure occur during normal operation of the facility. One example of biocontain ment laboratory operation a nd maintenance procedures that would be required is daily inspections of essential containment and life support systems that must be completed and documented before laboratory work is initiated to ensure that the laboratory is operating according to established parameters. Preparation of the operation and maintenance SO Ps with the appropriate training typically occurs over a 3- to 6-month period after construction is completed. Practical and effective protocols for emergency situati ons must be established. These protocols must include plans for medical emergencies, facility malfunctions, fir es, animals escaping within the laboratory, and other potential emergencies. Training in emergency response pr ocedures must be provided to emergency response personnel and other responsible staff according to institutional policies. Many of the training and testing requirements are to maintain certification and licensure to operate a laboratory, wh ich generally take up to a year beyond the construction phase to complete. The BM BL is the primary guidance source to ensure a safe and effective testing and training program for successful state-of-the-art biocontainment laboratory facilities. The use of hazardous biological agents or toxins that are regarded as select agen ts under Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins; Interim Final Rule (9 CFR 121) is regulated by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is responsible for the management of the Select Agent Pr ogram. Research protocols involving the use of select agents require registration of the NBAF and inspection of its laboratories by the CDC or APHIS. CDC or APHIS would inspect the laboratories at least once over a 3-year period. This inspection is not required prior to approval of the application. June 2008 2-5 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement 2.2.2.1 Operating Staff Once operational, the proposed NBAF would employ a pproximately 250 to 350 people. In addition to the scientific and administrative staff of the laboratory, the proposed NBAF would employ technicians, veterinary staff, building engineers, and security personnel. All laboratory staff would receive thorough pre-operational training, as well as ongoing training, in the handli ng of hazardous infectious agents, understanding biocontainment functions of standard and special practices for each biosafety level, and understanding biocontainment equipment and laboratory characteristics. Laboratory staff would be supervised by trained and experienced scientists. The NBAF safety and bio safety staff would review and approve of proposed protocols and SOPs for the laboratory prior to use. Laboratory staff working in the proposed NBAF would use the standards and procedures recommended for a ll institutions engaged in biological research. 2.2.2.2 Waste and Materials Management The solid and liquid wastes generated in the BSL-2, BSL-3, BSL-3E, BSL-3Ag, and BSL-4 laboratories would be considered biohazardous and treated by steriliza tion, chemical disinfection, and/or incineration. The efficiency in sterilizing and disinfecting waste would be verified by the use of heat and biological indicators. Materials and equipment that require removal from bioc ontainment areas also would be decontaminated prior to removal. Decontamination is required for any substance exposed to a BSL-3E, BSL-3Ag, or BSL-4 agent. For a decontamination system to be effective, it mu st conform to the following design criteria: Ease of transport and loading into treatment equipment Worker protection and reduction of biohazard aerosol generation Decontamination based on pr oven consistent technologies Validated and repeatable Volume reduction for final disposal Compliant with local, state, and federal environmental requirements Cost-effective (capital and operating) Technical degree of automation to achieve effective labor savings Maintenance friendly Liquid Biowaste Treatment System . A dedicated biowaste gathering and treatment system would be provided for BSL-3, BSL-3E, BSL-3Ag, and BSL-4 f unctions. Each of the laboratories and associated procedure rooms, animal rooms, and storage/centrif uge rooms are provided with a biological liquid waste collection and treatment system. All liquid waste would be treated through a batch sterilization process. The biowaste system would employ gravity drainage to the liquid effluent decontamination system using double- wall piping required in areas outside of containable space and which cannot be readily inspected. The effluent decontamination system tanks would be hou sed in a dedicated space located below the functional floor area served in a \"biocontainable\" service space. Carcass Disposal System. A dedicated carcass disposal system w ould be utilized for BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 areas. The USDA ARS 242.1 Facilities Design Standards c ontains a requirement to provide for incineration of animal carcasses infected with BSL-3Ag agents a nd BSL-4 agents or to have an alternative solution presented for consideration based on a comparative an alysis. Incinerators are being phased out due to permitting and maintenance issues, and replacement technologies are currently being investigated. Incineration is still, however, considered the most eff ective method for disposal of infected carcasses at many universities and research establishments. BSL3-Ag is unique to agriculture b ecause of the necessity to protect the environment from an economic, high risk pathogen in a situation where studies are conducted employing large agricultural animals or other similar situations in which the facility barriers now serve as prim ary containment. Pathological incinerators, or other June 2008 2-6 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement approved means, must be provided for the safe disposal of the large carcasses of infected animals. Redundancy and the use of multiple technologies need to be considered and evaluated. The latest biocontainment faciliites included multiple disposal methods as a safety feature to ensure a proven method of disposal is available at all times. Sterilization is only part of the challenge in managi ng carcass disposal. Emissions and by-products generated from carcass sterilization must also be managed as part of the waste stream processes. Because of the emissions and by-products generated and the limited ability to attain permits to construct incinerators, DHS is evaluating various disposal systems that are described in more detail in Section 3.13. Conventional solid waste would be ge nerated during construction as well as during operation of the NBAF and would be appropriate for disposal at a municipal waste facility. Section 3.13 provides a more detailed description of the types of solid wastes generated by the NBAF and potential disposal methodologies. 2.2.2.3 Sample Transportation Regulations on transportation of biological agents are aimed at ensuring that the public and the workers in the transportation chain are protected from exposure to any ag ent that might be in the package. Protection is achieved through 1) the requirements for rigorous packag ing that will withstand rough handling and contain all liquid material within the package without leakage to the outside, 2) appropriate labeling of the package with the biohazard symbol and other labels to alert th e workers in the transportation chain to the hazardous contents of the package, 3) documentation of the hazardous contents of the package should such information be necessary in an emergency situatio n, and 4) training of workers in th e transportation chain to familiarize them with the hazardous contents so as to be able to respond to emergency situations. Regulations that apply to transportation of samples include Department of Transportation (DOT) 49 CFR Parts 171-178, Hazardous Materials Regulations, Public Health Service 42 CFR Part 72, Interstate Transportation of Etiologic Agents. Samples transported to the NBAF would be provided by commercial suppliers, research collaborators, or other parties seeking sample identification. Samples ma y contain either previously identified or unidentified microorganisms or strains. As a requirement of trans port, in accordance with federal regulations, the package originator must identify the contents and provide the required shipping documentation detailing the package contents to the transporter and receiver. Thus, the receiver would know what level of protection to apply (e.g., Biological Safety Cabinets [B SC], Personal Protective Equipment, and medical treatments). At a minimum, incoming packages to the NBAF would be ope ned in a Class II BSC. Section 3.11.9, Traffic and Transportation, addresses sample transportation to a nd from the proposed NBAF, and Appendix E to the Health and Safety Section, describes the potential consequences of transportation-related release of pathogens. Samples would be shipped to the NBAF by commercial package delivery services in accordance with International Air Transport Association packing instruc tions. All samples would be packaged and shipped in accordance with DOT and CDC require ments for transporting potentially biohazardous samples. All shipped packages would be received at the NBAF central delivery warehouse before delivery to the NBAF. Strict chain-of-custody procedures for samples would be follo wed. After the package is transported to the NBAF, the package would then be logged in to the NBAF inventory. The external packaging material would be inspected, removed, and disposed of according to the NBAF waste handling procedures. The interior packing with the intact sample would be placed safely and secu rely in the appropriate BSL laboratory under a chain- of-custody procedure until the author ized researcher was re ady to process the samples. Unpacking of the primary container would be done only in a BSC. The samples would be stored for preservation within a locked freezer or refrigerator, according to the requirements dictated by the nature of the sample. Inventories of all samples and cultures would be maintained in accordance with CDC standard practices and requirements. Samples containing select agents would be handled in accordance with USDA and CDC select agent rules. Select agents would be accepted only if a responsible offi cial is notified in advance of shipment and after the June 2008 2-7 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement CDC/APHIS Form 2 has been completed in accordance with regulations, registration is verified, and the requesting responsible official has been notified in ad vance of the shipment. Proper transfer documentation is approved prior to shipment by the sending and receivi ng institutions, as well as the by CDC and/or APHIS. Upon arrival, the NBAF personnel would notify the res ponsible investigator or designee of the shipment arrival per select agent transfer procedures dictated by APHIS and/or by CDC. Any select-agent-certified NBAF personnel may accept the sample. The sample would be logged in by the NBAF personnel and in accordance with the NBAF receiving procedures. Samples shipped from the NBAF would follow a simila r procedure for receiving samples. The documentation would be approved by the receiving institution, the NBAF, and APHIS and/or CDC prior to sending the select agent. For select agents, an authorized employee woul d be onsite at the NBAF to inspect and close the package in the presence of the se nder. The packaging and appropriate documentation (i.e., Institutional Biosafety Committee [IBC] select agents' checklist, CDC/APHIS Form 2, and permits) must conform to DOT and CDC requirements for transport of biological materi als. The sender would remain with the package until the DOT-approved commercial carrier arrived to take possession. 2.2.2.4 Chemicals Storage and Use The proposed NBAF would house the laboratory chemicals necessary to conduct the planned research, training, and diagnostic activities; maintain the equi pment; care for animals; and clean the facilities and equipment. The chemicals would range from floor clean ers, which are often skin irritants, to hazardous laboratory chemicals. The types of chemicals that w ould pose physical hazards are flammable or combustible liquids, peroxides, oxidizers, and pyrophorics. Those chemicals that would pose health hazards are corrosives/irritants, flammables, sens itizers, toxics, teratogens, and carcinogens. If NBAF operations permit, chemicals would be stored using a HAZMAT Pharmacy concept. This provides centralized logistics for hazardous materials, reduces quantities needed on hand, and minimizes risks of incidents. All laboratory personnel would be adequately trained in the proper use, storage, and disposal of these chemicals. Chemical handling and storage would be conducted accordi ng to all appropriate gui delines and protocols. 2.2.2.5 Pollution and Spill Prevention A site-specific Pollution Prevention Plan would be developed for the NBAF and would include specific procedures for spill prevention and cleanup. The specifi c procedures address prevention elements such as proper storage, operating procedures, inspection, and traini ng to prevent or lessen the possibility of spills, as well as biocontainment features such as biocontainment walls in storage facilities. The NBAF would develop a Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasures Plan (SPCC) addressing the protection of surface water and a SWPPP. The SP CC addresses operating procedures to prevent spills, control measures to contain spills, and countermeasures to contain, cleanup, and mitigate the effects of a spill reaching a water body. The specific requirements for a SWPPP vary from state to state and would include measures to prevent pollutants from reaching water bodies due to stormwater runoff. These plans would be reviewed and revised as necessary. 2.2.2.6 Research Protocols Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC). The use of any biological agent requires the review and approval of the IBC of USDA/APHIS. IBC memb ership, responsibilities, and roles ar e defined in the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH 2002). The focus of the IBC is adherence to well- established biological safety practices that protect the researchers and the surrounding community. The IBC is vested with the authority to appr ove the use of a biological agent, deny approval, or take action to stop work. Possession of and any work involving select agents, whether they are BSL-3 or BSL-4 agents, requires registration of the facility by APHIS and/or the CD C. The registration process includes identity of the agent(s), the location of use and storage of the agent( s), and a detailed description of laboratory containment June 2008 2-8 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement provisions and security measures. IBC approval of SOPs is required, and the laboratories would be inspected by the CDC at least once over a given 3-year period. The IBC is comprised of committee members with overl apping and interdisciplinary expertise, including microbiologists, infectious disease specialists, safety experts, and community representatives. Notifications for Use of Biological Agents received by the IBC are critically reviewed by experts focusing on the safe use of the biological agent(s) at the appropriate biosafety level. APHIS Animal Research Policy and Institut ional Animal Care and Use Committee. The APHIS Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) reviews all protocols and proposals for research, testing, and education that involve the use of vertebrate animals to be certain that care and use of animals is in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act as amended (7 USC, 2131-2156), Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (Institute for Laboratory Animal Research 1996), guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC), and state and local regulations. The IACUC is comprised of at least five members with mandatory membership of a doctor of veterinary medicine with training or experience in laboratory animal science and medicine and who has program authority and responsibility for activities involving animals at the NBAF. The IACUC may approve, require proposal modifications, or withhold approval of all research a nd testing protocols related to the care and use of vertebrate animals. In approving protocols, the IACUC ensures that Animal pain, distress, and functional or sensory impairment are minimized. All survival surgery is perfo rmed using aseptic procedures. Adequate veterinary care is planned for and provided. The type and number of animals are appropriate and necessary as an essential part of the protocol. Anesthetics, analgesics, tranquilizers, and euth anasia procedures are used appropriately when necessary. The NBAF animal facilities are subject to inspections a nd site visits from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USDA, and AAALAC. AAALAC is a privat e, nonprofit organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through a voluntary accreditation program. Inspections can include review of IACUC protocols, minutes of all IACUC meetings, all animal use, and care records. Access to animal housing facilities and laboratories is required for inspectors. 2.2.3 Decommissioning of the Proposed NBAF Once the proposed NBAF has reached its life expectancy, DHS may choose to decommission the facility and transition the property for future use according to curr ent agreements. Development of standards for biosafety laboratories and associated equipment has focused on the construction and operati on of new or existing facilities. Standard laboratory procedures and decontamination protocols would be performed according to the BMBL to ensure worker safety and to ensure health and safety of the general public. It is anticipated that site-specific protocols and a decontamination and deco mmissioning plan would be developed for this action, should it occur. The plan would address such factors as decontamination methodologies; disposition of used equipment and re-use, disposal, or salvaging site materials; and post-decontamination monitoring. 2.3 S ITE ALTERNATIVES DHS investigated a number of options to meet the mission requirements of HSPD-9. In Fiscal Year 2006, Congress appropriated money for site selection and other pre-construction activities for the NBAF. DHS developed a site selection process because Congress did not designate a specific site upon which to build and construct the NBAF. This section describes that process a nd the results of the investigations that led to the development of and selection of reasonable alternatives to achieve the purpose and need of the NBAF and, accordingly, such reasonable alternatives are considered for examination in this DEIS. June 2008 2-9 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement 2.3.1 Alternative Site Selection Process DHS issued a Public Notice soliciting Expressions of Inte rest (EOIs) for potential sites for the NBAF in the Federal Business Opportunities on January 17, 2006, and the Federal Register on January 19, 2006. DHS received 29 EOIs by the March 31, 2006, due date stated in the Public Notices Soliciting EOIs. DHS conducted an initial evaluation of the 29 EOIs, using the four evaluation criteria set forth in the Public Notice Soliciting EOIs. These evaluation criteria were developed by an interagenc y working group to ensure that NBAF would meet the purpose and need of the project and the interdependent needs of DHS and USDA to adequately protect the nation against biological threats to animal agriculture. The four evaluation criteria were 1. Proximity to Research Capabilities 2. Proximity to Workforce 3. Acquisition/Construction/Operations 4. Community Acceptance DHS developed and implemented a rigorous process for the first round evaluation of the 29 EOIs received against DHS's evaluation criteria and associated sub- criteria. Three committees comprised of federal employees evaluated the EOIs, assessing their strengt hs, weaknesses, and deficiencies against the four evaluation criteria and associated sub-criteria. A Steering Committee, also comprised of only federal employees, made recommendations to the DHS Selecti on Authority, who selected those sites that had sufficient qualifications with regard to the evaluation cr iteria (and would therefore be further considered in a second round of evaluations) and eliminated some sit es for further consideration due to weaknesses and/or deficiencies with respect to the following evaluation criteria: 1. Lack of proximity to existing BSL-3 or BSL-4 r esearch programs that could be linked to NBAF mission requirements. 2. Difficulty in demonstrating ability to attract world- class researchers and scientists or skilled technical workforce with necessary experience. 3. Insufficient infrastructure, utilities, or other siting difficulties. 4. Insufficient community support for siting of NBAF. After DHS's First Round evaluation of the 29 EOIs, 18 potential sites for the proposed NBAF from 12 consortia remained under consideration in a second round of the site selection process. The DHS selection authority requested that the consortia proposing the 18 remaining sites provide additional information, limited to the broader categories of information falling within the originally published evaluation criteria in DHS's Public Notice soliciting EOI. In December 2006, DHS se nt Additional Information Requests to the consortia proposing the 18 remaining sites. In the December 2006 letter, DHS also communicated its preference for certain evaluation criteria that would be considered by the federal employee evaluation committee in the second round of DHS's site selection process. These DHS preferences were that 1. The proposed site be within a comprehensive r esearch community that has existing research programs in areas related to NBAF mission requirements; 2. The proposed site be within proximity to skilled research and technical staff with expertise in operations conducted at biological and agricultural research facilities and be within proximity to training programs for such expertise; 3. Title to at least a 30-acre site would be deeded at no or minimal cost to the U.S. Government and all NBAF construction (BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories) could occur at the 30-acre site; 4. In-kind contributions (e.g., support to the NEPA process, deeded land, new utilities, roads, chilled and steamed water) would be donated by proposing consortia; 5. The proposed site is environmentally suitable; and June 2008 2-10 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement 6. The proposing consortia could demonstrate that lo cal and national stakeholder community members' support, or at least do not oppose, locating the NBAF at the proposed site. Upon receipt of this additional information from the consortia, a federal team consisting of USDA and DHS employees conducted site visits to all the remaining sites. The intent of the site visits was to 1) verify the information provided and representations made in the EOI submissions and additi onal information submitted and 2) enable evaluation committee representatives to view any observable physical conditions and constraints at the proposed site and, if applicable, view the site's utilities and infrastructure. Based on federal employee evaluation team's analysis of the additional information and observations on the site visits, the evaluation team recommended to the DHS Selection Authority which sites should advance for further evaluation. The DHS selection authority determ ined that five sites met the evaluation criteria and DHS preferences and would therefore be advanced as reasonable alternatives to be studied in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). Figure 2.3.1-1 below is an illustration of the previously described steps in the site selection process. Figure 2.3.1-1 \u2014 Site Selection Process Although not part of the competitive site selection process, Plum Island was determined to be a reasonable site to advance for study in the EIS, making a total of six sites for consideration. The four reasons for including Plum Island as a reasonable alternative were 1. Plum Island (while currently owned by DHS) app ears to meet the NEPA requirement that the proposing Federal agency evaluate the range of all \"reasonable alternatives\" to a proposed action, where reasonable alternatives are defined as those th at are \"practical or feasible from the technical and economic standpoint and using common sense, rather than simply desirable from the standpoint of the applicant\"; 2. Plum Island currently performs much of the existing research and houses the existing workforce assessing potential threats to animals from foreign animal diseases and zoonotic diseases; 3. Plum Island currently fulfills a portion of the goa ls and mission identified for the NBAF and meets some of the NBAF criteria, including having a skilled workforce in a BSL-3 environment; and 4. Plum Island could reasonably be internally eval uated throughout the EIS process, given that DHS already owns Plum Island and did not believe it appropriate to respond to its own Request for Expressions of Interest. The six sites published in the Federal Register on July 31, 2007, for the NBAF EIS process are shown in Table 2.3.1-1. Table 2.3.1-1 \u2014 Six Site Alternatives Location Site Name Athens, Georgia Milledge Avenue Site Manhattan, Kansas Manhattan Campus Site Flora, Mississippi Flora Industrial Park Site Plum Island, New York Plum Island Site Butner, North Carolina Umstead Research Farm Site San Antonio, Texas Texas Research Park Site June 2008 2-11 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement Additionally, the \"No Action\" Alternative is define d as leaving PIADC open and performing at its current mission capability with construction of previously pla nned improvements, but wit hout the construction of NBAF, and utilizing international laborator ies when available for BLS-4 research. 2.3.2. South Milledge Avenue Site; Athens, Georgia The South Milledge Avenue Site is located west of the South Milledge Avenue and Whitehall Road intersection in Clarke County, Georgia (Figure 2.3.2.-1). The site is part of the University of Georgia Whitehall Farm and is located near the University of Ge orgia Livestock Instructional Area. The site is a 67- acre tract of land consisting of open p astureland and wooded land and is utili zed by the University of Georgia Equestrian Team. The topography is rolling terrain, wh ich slopes towards the southwest. The site has been undeveloped land since at least 1936 and is currently zone d government use. The preliminary site design is shown in Figure 2.3.2-2. 2.3.3 Manhattan Campus Site; Manhattan, Kansas The Manhattan Campus Site is on the campus of Kansas State University (KSU) immediately adjacent to the Biosecurity Research Institute (Figur e 2.3.3-1). The site location cons ists of approximately 48.4 acres southeast of the intersection of Kimball Avenue and De nison Avenue. The site has been used for animal research since the 1970s. The site includes several structures, including five research buildings, a residential structure, and a storage building for recycling mate rials. The preliminary site design is shown in Figure 2.3.3-2. The site has been part of KSU since at least the 1920s and is utilized for various agricultural purposes since the 1970s. The site is currently zoned as Un iversity District and was annexed to the City of Manhattan in 1994. The 48.4-acre site could be expanded to 70 acres. 2.3.4 Flora Industrial Park Site; Flora, Mississippi The Flora Industrial Park Site is located in Madi son County, Mississippi, and is owned by the Madison County Economic Development Authority (Figure 2.3.4-1) . Flora Industrial Park is a mixed-use commercial park 45 miles from the Jackson-Evers International Air port. Additional land is available surrounding the site for support facilities. The site is located on the east side of U.S. Highway 49, north and east of the intersection with North 1st Street. The Flora Industrial Park Site is approximately 150 acres of idle pasture land with two small ponds and a few scattered woode d areas. An overhead power transmission line is present through the south-central and west-central portions of the site. The site is currently zoned limited industrial. The preliminary site design is shown in Figure 2.3.4-2. Based on historical information, it appears that the site has been cultivated and pasture land previo usly occupied by two small tenant houses and one hay barn (Terracon 2007b). Adjoining properties appear to have been predominantly agricultural and rural residential until construction of the southwest-adj oining Primos Manufacturing Company in the early 2000s. 2.3.5 Plum Island Site; Plum Island, New York Plum Island is an 840-acre island located about 12 miles southwest of New London, Connecticut, and 1.5 miles from the northeast tip of Long Island, New York (i.e., Orient Point). The island is technically located in the Village of Greenfield, Town of Southold, Suffolk County, New York. However, the island has limited association with the town and is currently the respons ibility of the U.S. government. Although PIADC does not meet the project purpose and need identified in Chap ter 1, construction of a completely new facility on Plum Island would be a suitable alternative. The Plum Island Site consists of a pproximately 24 acres of land located directly to the east of the existing PIADC, which is on the western shore of Plum Island (Figure 2.3.5-1). Although one of the requirements list ed in the original EOI stated that a minimum of 30 acres would be required, the Plum Island Site w ould not require the full 30 acres. Existing facilities associated with PIADC would be available for use w ith the NBAF and would reduce the amount of space required. The 24-acre site has no existing structures. Dense underbrush with gravel roads are found within the southwestern and northeastern portions. The southeaster n portion of the island has previously been used June 2008 2-12 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement for sand mining and is generally void of vegetatio n. The northwestern portion of the island has minor vegetation. A potable water line bisects the site from east to west, and an underground electric service borders the site on the north side. Based on a review of the hist orical information, the Plum Island Site was formerly utilized as a dumping area for miscellaneous non-infecti ous wastes associated with PIADC, but the site has since been remediated. The preliminary site design is shown in Figure 2.3.5-2.

Dillon Youth Development Center in Butner. The site is a 249-acre tract of pasture, grassla nd, and wooded land. The site is currently owned and operated by North Carolina State University as part of the North Carolina Department of Agriculture Umstead Research Farm and is zoned as institutional. The prelimin ary site design is shown in Figure 2.3.6-2. The site area was operated from early 1942 to June 1943 as part of Camp Butner, a training facility for light infantry and artillery during World War II. Other operations incl uded ammunition storage, a redeployment center, and a general and convalescent hospital. The site has been undeveloped wooded land since at least 1940, except for one cemetery. The site has historically been main tained as undeveloped wooded land; however, in the fall of 2001, the site and surrounding area was partially logged. 2.3.7 Texas Research Park Site; San Antonio, Texas The Texas Research Park Site in San Antonio, Texas, extends over the Bexar County line into a portion of Medina County (Figure 2.3.7-1). The 100.1-acre site is located west of Lambda Drive, south of the proposed extension of Omicron Drive, and is currently v acant, undeveloped land covered in dense vegetation comprised of trees, shrubs, and tall prairie grasses. The site appears to have consisted of vacant, undeveloped ranch land before 1938 to the present. The site has no zoning category because it is outside the San Antonio city limits. The preliminary site design is shown in Fi gure 2.3.7-2. The entire Texas Research Park property is a 1,000-acre industrial district 4 miles outside the San Antonio city limits.

The following alternatives were considered but were determined not to be reasonable alternatives for evaluation in the DEIS. 2.4.1 Upgrading PIADC The current PIADC does not meet the purpose and need as described in Chapter 1. PIADC does not have the required BSL-4 laboratory space, and the existing infrastru cture is inadequate to support a BSL-4 facility. Upgrading and expanding the current PIADC to meet the NBAF requirements was initially considered for evaluation. A number of factors caused this alterna tive to be eliminated from further consideration: refurbishing the existing facilities and obsolete infrastructure to allow PIADC to meet the current mission would be more costly than building a new facility (NBAF) on Plum Island, so the cost of upgrading PIADC to meet the NBAF mission would be even greater; PIADC does not have the substantial amount of new research space that would be required, including space for a BSL-4 facility, which does not currently exist at PIADC. In addition, for the existing facility to be refurbished, current research activities might have to be suspended for extensive periods. These temporary shutdown periods would be counterproductive to the current PIADC mission and to the security of the United States. Theref ore, PIADC does not meet the purpose and need of the Proposed Action. In light of these considerations, and because building a new facility at Plum Island was already one of the site alternatives being considered, continued evaluation of this alternative was eliminated. 2.4.2 Using Existing Laboratory Facilities No existing U.S. facility could meet the mission need s determined by DHS and USDA. Although a number of BSL-3 and BSL-4 facilities are located in the United States, they do not have the capacity to conduct the research required to satisfy the NBAF mission needs. Similar facilities in Winnipeg, Canada, and Geelong, Australia, do not have the capacity to address the outbreak scenarios in the United States in a timely manner and could not guarantee their availability to meet U.S. research requirements. 2.4.3 Other Locations As described in Section 2.2, other potential locations to construct the NBAF were considered during the site selection process but were eliminated based on evalua tion by the selection committee. It was suggested during the scoping process that the NBAF be constructed in a remote location such as an island distant from populated areas or in a location that would be inhospitabl e (e.g., desert or arctic habitat) to escaped animal hosts/vectors; however, the evaluation criteria called for proximity to research programs that could be linked to the NBAF mission and proximity to a technical workforce (Section 2.2). The Plum Island Site is an isolated location as was suggested while still m eeting the requirements listed in the EOI. It was also suggested th at the NBAF could be constructed beneath a mountain; however, the cost and feasibility of such a constructi on project would be prohibitive. 2.5 S UMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND COSTS This section provides a brief summary of the alternativ e site evaluation process and presents a comparison of the effects of the alternatives on the various resources in a tabular format. The comparison also includes other site-specific information that may be of inte rest to the decision makers and general public. A Site Cost Analysis was prepared to determine the full costs of constructing the NBAF at the alternative sites. The projected site specific costs included the following four major categories: June 2008 2-27 NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement June 2008 2-28 Construction Estimate - This incl udes the construction budget, moveable scientific equipment budget, escalation, contingency, and fees. Systems Maintenance - This includes all maintenance related costs, both material and or contract costs, to support the NBAF. Utility Costs - This includes the anticipated utility consumption based on this preliminary program. These costs factor in each specific site's climate. Salaries - This includes all salaries related to the personnel that would be working within the NBAF compound. 2.5.1 Summary of Environmen tal Impacts by Resource Table 2.5.1-1 presents the projected cost estimates for the various alternatives. Table 2.5.1-2 presents a summary comparison of potentia l environmental impacts. A more detailed analysis is provided in Chapter 3. Environmental effects cat egories were applied to each resource for each site alternative and the No Action Alternative to provide a subjective comparison of the alternatives. Table 2.5.1-3 provides a description of the effect categories used for comparison in Table 2.5.1-4. 2.5.2 Mitigation Measures Adverse effects to resources were minimized or elimin ated through the site selection process and placement of the proposed NBAF within the bou ndaries of each alternative site. There would be little or no direct effects to wetlands, water resources, natural biotic communities, protected species, or cultural and archaeological resources with the Proposed Action. Management of stormwater runoff during both construction and operation of the NBAF and measures to eliminate or minimize the potential effects of spills or releases from the NBAF would mitigate potential sec ondary effects to resources. Section 3.15 provides a more detailed description of specific mitigation measures for the Proposed Action. Table 2.5.1-1 \u2014 Preliminary Costs of the NBAF Alternatives June 2008 2-29Cost Category South Milledge Avenue Site (dollars) Manhattan Campus Site (dollars) Flora Industrial Park Site (dollars) Umstead Research Farm Site (dollars) Plum Island Site (dollars) Texas Research Park Site (dollars) Construction Impact Statement 1 The maintenance, utility, and salary costs represent an averag e annual cost taken from the estim ates of these costs over the in itial 8 years as projected in the site cost analysis.

Air Quality (Section 3.4) No Action No effects to air quality would occur. Tempor ary effects would occur with construction activities associated with authorized inf rastructure improvements. South Milledge Avenue Site Air quality effects would occur with construction and operation of the NBAF. Air emissions from construction activities would include construction traffic and equipment. Operation of the NBAF would result in air emissions from boilers, emergency generators, and traffic from employees and deliveries. Additional air emissions would occur from carcass and pathologic waste treatment and may include incineration, alk aline hydrolysis, or rendering. Preliminary assessments based on conservative estimates of air emissions i ndicate that operation of the NBAF would n ot likely affect regional air quality, although ai r permit requirements may require additional m odeling once the final di sposal methodology has been selected.

Socioeconomics (Section 3.10) No Action No effects to employment, income, population, housing, or quality of life would occur. No disproportionate effects to low-inco me or minority populations would occur. NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement Table 2.5.1-2 \u2014 Comparison of Environmental Effects (Continued) June 2008 2-38Alternative Effects South Milledge Avenue Site Construction activities would result in 1,639 temporary jobs (661 direct jobs and 978 associated jobs) generating an estimated $150 million in labor income and $14.6 million in state and local taxes. Population, h ousing, and quality of life would not be affected by constructi on. Operation of the NBAF would result in 250-350 direct jobs and an estimated income of $27 millio n annually (0.8% increase in Cla rke County). An estimated $1.6 million in state and local taxes would be generated. Population growth due to the NBAF would be 4.9% of the esti mated growth in the study area. The effect of the NBAF on the housing market and qu ality of life (schools, law enforcement, fire protection, medica l facilities, recreation, and health and safety) would be negligible. Law enforcement and fire protection personnel would be adequately trained by DHS to respond to incidents at the NBAF. The risk of an accidental release of a pa thogen is extremely low (see Section 3.14), but the economic eff ect would be significa nt. The cattle and pork industries in Georgia and the area around the site are relatively small, resulting in less potential economic loss from an extr eme FMD-related event than has been previously described. Response measures to contain and eliminate the threat would al so greatly reduce the potential e conomic loss. The potential economic loss would be significant due to zoonotic diseases that can affect human as well as animal populations. The warm climate and aquatic habitat suitable for arthropod vectors would increase the likelihood that the RVF would establish a sustainable reservo ir. However, the risk of release remains very small. The site is located in a census block group containing higher low-income populations than Clarke County. There are no long-term , high, adverse, and disproportionate effects which would occur to low-income or mi nority populations. Visual effects and traffic increases due to c onstruction would be minimized with proper site management protocols. Potential traffic effects would be minimized by limiting road closures and rer outing traffic. Economic benefits would potentially occur to populations within the area due to construction-related jobs. Should a release of certain vector- borne pathogens occur, impacts such as aerial spraying of insecticid e(s) could directly affect minority and low-income communities an d other populations immediately adjacent to the site.

Operation of the NBAF would result in 250-350 direct jobs and an estimated income of $26.8 million annually (0.8% increase in t he three-county region). An estimated $1.5 million in state and local taxes would be generated. Population growth due to the NBAF would be sign ificant based on historic trends but would be small compared to increases expected with expansions at Fort Riley. The effect of the NBAF on the housing market and quality of life (schools, law enforcement, fire protection, medical facilities, recreation, and health and safety) would be neg ligible, although the Fort Riley expansion would require some investment in schools, law enforcement, fire protection, and medical facilities.

Law enforcement and fire protection personnel are currently adequately trained by DHS to respond to incidents at the PIADC, and additional training may be required for the NBAF. The risk of an accidental release of a pa thogen is extremely low (see Section 3.14), but the economic eff ect would be significa nt. The cattle and pork industries in the counties adjacent to the proposed site are small, and Plum Island is virtually free of livestock populations and other animals potentially affected by FMD. The geographic isola tion from the mainland significantly mitigates th e risk of the virus reaching livestock p opulations.

An estimated 77,40 0 gpd of pretreated wastewater would be discharged to the municipal sewer system. The volume and characteristics of the waste stream would not exceed current or projected capacit y or requirements. Plum Island Site Construction would generate construction debris, sanitary solid wa ste, and wastewater. Operation of the NBAF would result in g eneration of wastewater, waste solids, and medical, hazardous, and industrial so lid wastes. An estimated 63,00 0 gpd of pretreated wastewater would be discharged to the municipal sewer system. The volume and characteristics of the waste stream would not exceed current or projected capacit y or requirements. Umstead Research Farm Site Construction would generate construction debris, sanitary solid wa ste, and wastewater. Operation of the NBAF would result in g eneration of wastewater, waste solids, and medical, hazardous, and industrial so lid wastes. An estimated 70,00 0 gpd of pretreated wastewater would be discharged to the municipal sewer system. The volume and characteristics of the waste stream would not exceed current or projected capacit y or requirements. Texas Research Park Site Construction would generate construction debris, sanitary solid wa ste, and wastewater. Operation of the NBAF would result in g eneration of wastewater, waste solids, and medical, hazardous, and industrial so lid wastes. An estimated 80,00 0 gpd of pretreated wastewate r would be discharged to the municipal sewer system. The volume and characteristics of the waste stream would not exceed current or projected capacit y or requirements. Health and Safety (Section 3.14) No Action No effects to health and safety would occu r. However, the authorized renovations at PIADC will improve health and safety conditions at PIADC. South Milledge Avenue Site The construction and operation of the NBAF would present the standard in dustrial hazards of slips, trips, falls, wounds, electr ical hazards, chemical toxicity, fire hazards, an d traumatic injuries. Equipment and facility system s would serve as primary and secondary barriers t o the release of infectious biological materials while administrative c ontrols would serve an important support f unction. The primary hazard of the NBAF op erations is the pathogen and the consequences of its release. There are very few accident scenarios that would result in animal or human diseas e, the exceptions being an over-pressure event resulting in loss of containment and a facility fire, both of which present a moderate risk rank for dis tances close to the release. Because of the potential for easy spread of the disease via infected livestock, wildlif e and vectors the overall site risk rank is designated moderate. Manhattan Campus Site The construction and operation of the NBAF would present the standard in dustrial hazards of slips, trips, falls, wounds, electr ical hazards, chemical toxicity, fire hazards, an d traumatic injuries.

There are very fe w accident scenarios that would result in animal or human disea se, the exceptions being an over-pressure event resulting in loss of containment and a facility fire, both of which present a moderate risk rank for dis tances close to the release. The location of the Plum Island provides a barrier against the sp read of viruses. Given the low likelihood of in fected animals or vectors getting off of the island, which substantially reduces the potential for the spread of disease, there is a no or low overall site risk rank. Umstead Research Farm Site The construction and operation of the NBAF would present the standard in dustrial hazards of slips, trips, falls, wounds, electr ical hazards, chemical toxicity, fire hazards, an d traumatic injuries.

NBAF Draft Environmental Impact Statement June 2008 2-48 Table 2.5.1-3 \u2014 Environmental Effects Categories Effect Category Definition Significant An action that would greatly improve current conditions Moderate An action that would moderately improve current conditions Beneficial Effects Minor An action that would slightly improve current conditions Negligible or No Effect An action that would neither improve nor degrade current conditions Minor An action that would slightly degrade current conditions Moderate An action that would moderately degrade current conditions Adverse Effects Significant An action that would greatly degrade current conditions As shown in Table 2.5.1-4, the potential effects of the NB AF at the site alternatives are generally negligible to minor. There would be moderate effects to infrastructur e, mainly due to the demand for water and wastewater capacity due to NBAF operations. Moderate air qua lity effects at the Plum Island Site and the Texas Research Park Site are due to their location in non-a ttainment areas. Moderate effects would occur to visual resources at the South Milledge Avenue Site, Manhattan Campus Site, Flora Industrial Park Site, and Umstead Research Farm Site and to traffic at the Sout h Milledge Avenue Site and Texas Research Park Site. Construction of the NBAF at any of the site alternativ es would have potential beneficial effects to wildlife, socioeconomics, and health and safety. The work perfo rmed at the NBAF could result in development of vaccines or new diagnostic tools to protect or contain outbreaks of foreign animal diseases. Significant Adverse Environmental Effects No significant adverse effects to environmental or human resources would be expected from any of the alternatives with normal operation of the NBAF. Mode rate effects that would occur would be to the following resources: Potable water - use of 36 million to 52 million gallons of potable water per year. Wastewater treatment capacity - generation of 25 m illion to 30 million gallons of wastewater per year. Visual Quality - visual prominence of the NBAF at four of the alternative site locations. Air Quality - Potential for air emissions to affect local air compliance plan s in Suffolk County, New York and Bexar County, Texas. Traffic - Potential adverse traffic flow effects at the South Milledge Avenue Site and the Texas Research Park Site. Significant beneficial effects to biological resources (w ildlife), economics, and health and safety could occur with the development of new vaccines, diagnostic pro cedures, or rapid responses to potential FAD outbreaks.

The evaluation conducted during the NEPA process and presented in this DEIS documents the potential effects of the various alternatives on the natural and human environments on a local, regional, and national scale. This evaluation will be used in conjunc tion with other factors to assist DHS in selecting the Preferred Alternative. Additional studies are being performed concurrently with this EI S that will provide important decision making information. Results of these studies along with agency and public input will be used in the development of the Final EIS and the ROD. A Preferred Alternative is the alternative that an agency believes would fulfill its statutory mission and responsibilities, giving consideration to economic, environmental, technical, and other factors. DHS will present its Preferred Alternative in the Final EIS. The ROD will address the following: Whether or not to build the NBAF; Other factors involved in the decision as to whether and where the NBAF would be built, including considerations of national policy, lifecycle co sts, site characterizations, security, and other programmatic considerations; If the decision is made to build the NBAF, where it will be built; How the site alternatives compare based on the environmental criteria studied; and Whether all practicable means to avoid or minimize environmental harm from the alternative selected have been adopted and, if not, why, as well as an y required mitigation, monitoring, and enforcement programs that would be necessary to offset any environmental impacts. In making these decisions and formulating the R OD, the following reports will be considered: NBAF EIS, Threat Risk Assessment, Site Cost Analysis, Site Characterization Study, and Plum Island Facility Closure and Transition Cost Study. The information contained in these reports will assist DHS and USDA, a consulting agency in this endeavor, in considering the protection of the public and th e environment while meeting the need for a domestic, modern, high-security BSL-3Ag and BSL-4 research fac ility with the capabilities needed to address potential threats to our agriculture.
