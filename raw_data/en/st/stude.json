Please do not send personal health information by email, unless requested by us to do so. IF YOU HAVE an emergency or urgent concern please phone Healthline 811, Mobile Crisis Saskatoon 306-933-6200 or 911. Disclosure for virtual appointments Student Wellness Centre offers a combination of virtual care and in person visits. We may be using video and audio technologies for virtual appointments. Some of these technologies are provided by the province or territory. Others have been provided by vendors like Google or Apple to help make discussions with your care provider as easy as possible during these difficult times. Some health concerns can be addressed with virtual care alone, but in some cases your doctor may ask you to come in person for a physical examination. We do our best to make sure that any information you give to us during virtual care visits is private and secure, but no video or audio tools are ever completely secure. There is an increased security risk that your health information may be intercepted or disclosed to third parties when using video or audio communications tools. To help us keep your information safe and secure, you can do the following: - Understand that emails, calls or texts you receive are not secure in the same way as a private appointment in an exam room. - Use a private computer/device (i.e., not an employer's or third party's computer/device), secure accounts and a secure Internet connection. For example, using a personal and encrypted email account is more secure than using an unencrypted email account, and your access to the Internet on your home network will generally be more secure than an open guest Wi-Fi connection. You should also understand that electronic communication is not a substitute for in-person communication or clinical examinations, where appropriate, or for attending the emergency department when needed (including for any urgent care that may be required). By providing your information, you agree to let us collect, use or disclose your personal health information through video or audio communications (while following applicable privacy laws) in order to provide you with care. In particular, the following means of electronic communication may be used: - Videoconferencing (Pexip, WebEx, Zoom, etc.) - Text messaging (including instant messaging) Urgent assistance Immediate threat or danger; life threatening or severe psychological difficulties - Saskatoon Police Service 911 or 9-911 (on campus) - Royal University Hospital 103 Hospital Drive - Campus Protective Services (306) 966-5555 Urgent after hours assistance - Saskatoon Crisis Intervention Services (306) 933-6200 (24 hour) - Campus Protective Services (306) 966-5555 - Royal University Hospital Emergency 103 Hospital Drive - Saskatoon Police Service 911 or 9-911 on campus - Saskatoon Sexual Assault Crisis Centre (306) 244-2224 Services Students have acces to the following providers at Student Wellness Centre: - Family physicians - Nurse practitioners - Registered nurses - Community mental health nurses - Psychiatrists - Social workers and Counsellors - Psychologists - Obs-Gyne resident - Dietitian - Physiotherapists - Chiropractor - Massage therapist - Peer health education *Associated fees for physio, massage, and chiropractic.

Nursing Services For more information about nursing services at the Student Wellness Centre, please visit the following page: Immunizations for College Programs COVID-19 Vaccine and Tuberculin Skin Test If TB testing or TB blood work is required, it should be administered and read before immunization or delayed for at least 4 weeks after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Receiving the COVID-19 vaccine prior to having all steps of the TB test completed may cause the test to show a false-negative result. Vaccination with the COVID-19 vaccine may take place at any time after all steps of tuberculin skin testing has been completed. Resources: [https://www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19](https://www.saskatchewan.ca/COVID19) Instructions to Book your Immunization review at the Student Wellness Centre You must send in or e-mail or fax your immunization records and consent form prior to your first in person appointment. Review your College Web page for specific immunization requirements. All Health Science students must locate their childhood and adult immunization records. Email the records along with your consent form (that is located on your web page - the demographic information on this consent form is needed in order to create your chart and therefore book your appointment) to [student.wellness@usask.ca. ](mailto:student.wellness@usask.ca)OR fax to 306-966-5786. You will receive your TST (tuberculin skin test) on day 1, and then have it read 48 to 72 hrs later. There is a $40 charge for this payable by debit or credit card.. Medicine and Physical Therapy students require a 2 step TST, which consists of a TST on day 1, read 48 to 72 hrs later. IF the TST is negative, it is repeated 1 to 3 weeks later. There is an $80 charge for this. Health Sciences Students that are in a Health Science Program are required to provide documented proof of immunization. Completion of these requirements is mandatory for you to be able to do your clinical placements. Health Science Colleges include Medicine, Nursing, Physical Therapy, Dentistry, Dental Assistant Program, Pharmacy, Nutrition, Public Health and Veterinary Medicine. Completion of the immunization requirements is the responsibility of the student. This includes locating childhood and adult immunization records, booking appointments for your immunization review (have your schedule ready when you are booking), and any costs associated with the immunization program (we only accept exact cash or debit card). You must take a copy of the Immunization Record to your College once it has been completed. You will be asked to sign a consent form to share your immunization records and/or serology results with your College and clinical placements. This is to ensure your safety and the safety of your patients. Locate your child and adult immunization records. If you do not have these records, check with your parents, Public Health in the area where you grew up in, or your Physician's office. If your records are not located in Canada, check with any family that may be in the home country. If you immigrated to Canada as a child, Immigration Canada requires an immunization record signed from a Physician in your country. Ask your parents for this form. If you do not or cannot locate any records, you must start your immunizations over - this is costly and timely. Please make every effort to locate your records. Booking an Appointment - you may choose to see your Family Physician or Public Health Nurse to begin and/or complete your immunization review, but you are still required to have one appointment with Student Health Nurse to ensure all requirements have been met. Bring your health card to your visit. Students are to follow the recommendations for Immunizations for health care students as laid out in the most current Saskatchewan Immunization Manual.
