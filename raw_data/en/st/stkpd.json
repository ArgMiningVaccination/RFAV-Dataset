Homeopathic solutions can help to reduce the symptoms of Skin Crawling (Formication) Sensations.", "sitename": "Lifeforce", "date": "2022-11-27", "cleaned_text": "The word \"formication\" comes from the Latin word \"formica,\" which means \"ant.\" The feeling of bugs crawling on the skin or biting on or under the skin is known as formication. It doesn't always follow that the experience is being brought on by actual insects. It is a particular type of tactile hallucination, in which a person experiences a false sense of touch without any genuine physical reason or external input. The frequency and intensity of this sensation can be reduced gradually with the help of homeopathic formication treatments. Sometimes, the person develops a persistent illusion of parasitosis. When there is no such infestation, he/she has a strong and persistent belief that he is plagued by parasites, insects, or other pests. He/she can even claim to have observed bugs or worms crawling on or beneath the skin. This hallucination most frequently affects middle-aged or older women who have drug-induced formication. Formication is a sort of paraesthesia that is defined as an anomalous skin sensation without a visible physical cause. Other sensations such as tingling, prickling, burning, numbness, coldness, or a pin-prick feeling are also included in the term \"paraesthesia.\" Although any region of the body can experience these symptoms, hands, feet, arms, and legs are the most frequently affected parts. Pressure on a nerve, inadequate blood flow, and nerve injury are some causes of paraesthesia. Symptoms Of Formication The affected person could experience skin irritation or [skin crawling anxiety.](https://www.askdrshah.com/blog/feel-insects-crawling-skin/) This could result in picking and clawing at the skin's surface where the crawling affects. Scratching can occasionally be so intense that it results in bleeding and skin excoriations. Picking or scratching the skin can also lead to skin wounds and damage. It may become infected, thereby resulting in skin ulcers and open wounds. Formication may occur alongside other symptoms depending on the cause. These include feelings of drowsiness, body aches, stiffness, trembling hands, trouble focusing, depression, or agitation. 6 Homeopathic Solutions for Reducing Formication Homeopathy can be highly effective in treating the symptoms of formication.
