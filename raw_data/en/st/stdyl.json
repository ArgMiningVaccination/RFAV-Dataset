The Doctor of Acupuncture with a Chinese Herbal Medicine (DAcCHM) is a four-year degree program that incorporates the Master of Acupuncture with a Chinese Herbal Medicine Specialization (MAcCHM). Students cultivate the capacity to access the profound healing knowledge and ancient wisdom found in classical medical texts. Immersion within the ancient texts helps our students develop the required competencies to integrate classical wisdom, skills and values into today's healthcare system through effective communication and collaboration\u2014assuring enhanced clinical outcomes. Scholar-Mentor Approach to Becoming a Doctor of Acupuncture The College of Classical Chinese Medicine emphasizes education through a scholar-mentor approach and clinical practice designed to transmit the art, science and spirit of Chinese medicine. Our programs deliver the most comprehensive training in classical Chinese medicine offered within the U.S. As a DAcCHM graduate, you'll also receive an MAcCHM degree. Both degrees are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM) and qualify you to apply for licensure, and to take all of the AOM examinations administered by NCCAOM\u2014used in most states as the basis for licensure. \"Classical texts are the source and origin of classical Chinese medicine. I feel very fortunate to be able to study and teach them. They are not just theoretical discourses, but very practical clinical manuals. I apply them in clinic and am often amazed by the effectiveness of original instructions in the classics.\" Dr. Joon Hee Lee is fluent in classical literary Chinese and continues to discover wisdom and insights from the classical texts. He is also knowledgeable in the literature from Korea and Japan, and well-informed in the medical traditions of these East Asian countries. Dr. Lee completed his Master of Science in Oriental Medicine degree at Samra University of Oriental Medicine in Los Angeles, California, in 2004; and Doctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine degree at Oregon College of Oriental Medicine in 2010.
