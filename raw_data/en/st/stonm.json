Functional, integrative, and holistic medicine are three such approaches that are gaining popularity. While they share similarities, there are important differences between them that patients should be aware of when considering which approach is right for them. In this article, we will explore the differences between these three approaches to medicine. Overview of Functional, Integrative, and Holistic Medicine Functional medicine is an approach that aims to identify and address the root causes of illness rather than just treating the symptoms. This approach views the body as an interconnected system and focuses on addressing [imbalances and dysfunctions](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22673-hormonal-imbalance) in the body's natural processes. Integrative medicine, on the other hand, is an approach that combines conventional Western teachings with complementary and alternative therapies to treat the whole person - mind, body, and spirit. This approach emphasizes the importance of the patient-physician relationship and places an emphasis on patient-centered care. Holistic medicine is a comprehensive approach to healthcare that considers the whole person - [mind, body, and spirit](https://www.betterup.com/blog/mind-body-and-soul) - in the context of their environment. This approach emphasizes the importance of the interconnection between these factors and the impact they have on overall health and well-being.

Practitioners use a variety of diagnostic tests to evaluate a patient's health and identify any imbalances or dysfunctions in the body's natural processes. Integrative medicine practitioners also use diagnostic tests to evaluate a patient's health. However, they take a more patient-centered approach and consider a patient's lifestyle, environment, and emotional well-being when making a diagnosis. Holistic medicine practitioners take a broader approach to diagnosis. They consider a patient's physical, emotional, and spiritual health, as well as their environment and lifestyle when making a diagnosis.

Treatment plans may include changes to a patient's diet and lifestyle, supplements, and other interventions aimed at restoring balance to the body's natural processes.

Pros and Cons Functional medicine focuses on identifying and addressing the root causes of illness, which can lead to more effective treatment.
