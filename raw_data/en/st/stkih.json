These toxic exposures can negatively impact DNA expression, neurotransmitter balance, detoxification and myelination (nerve cells transmitting information faster and allowing complex brain processes). This toxicity is also responsible for compromising the patient's methylation and cellular functions. What is the PK protocol? The PK Protocol system is a new, clinically proven method for health care professionals to provide safe and efficient detoxification methods for the brain and the Central Nervous System. It has been developed by Dr. Patricia Kane, PhD. and her team. How does the PK protocol work? The approach of the PK protocol is to initiate detoxification at the cellular level addressing the essential fatty acid metabolism and establishing phospholipid stability. The PK Protocol includes targeted supplementation and intravenous therapy, to support membrane phospholipids, methylation and sulfation. This stabilizes the health of the cells, and consequently the health of the brain and the body. What are the benefits of the PK protocol? The PK protocol addresses the systemic nature of neurotoxic and toxic syndromes. Microbial infections Refractory heavy metal burdens Toxic mold exposure Environmental Illness It can also increase longevity What does the PK protocol consist in? Multiple daily infusions of intravenous (IV) phosphatidylcholine (PC or PhosChol) and a special nutrient-dense diet containing glutathione. (Glutathione is an important antioxidant found in living beings that prevents damage to important cellular components caused by free radicals peroxides which limits the metabolism of carbohydrates and oral supplements). Implementation of the PK protocol The PK protocol is a three-part program. 1. Blood samples are taken from the patient and sent to a lab 2. Then, the results are sent to BodyBio for analysis to check for different conditions such as cellular distortion, renal function and toxicity status. 3. Finally, the patient is given a detailed personalized report with recommendations for vitamins, minerals electrolytes, enzymes, fatty and amino acids, along with a personalized treatment plan, which can then be implemented by his treating physician.
