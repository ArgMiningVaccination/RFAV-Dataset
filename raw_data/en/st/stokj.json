advise sun protection and monitor patients for malignancies - In patients receiving long-term hydroxyurea for myeloproliferative disorders, such as polycythemia vera and thrombocythemia, secondary leukemias have been reported - It is unknown whether this leukemogenic effect is secondary to hydroxyurea or is associated with the patients' underlying disease - The physician and patient must very carefully consider the potential benefits relative to the undefined risk of developing secondary malignancies - Advise sun protection and monitor patients for malignancies Contraindications Hypersensitivity Severe anemia, bone marrow depression WBC Pregnancy, lactation Cautions Risk of cutaneous vasculitic toxicities in patients with myeloproliferative disorders, especially with history of or concurrent interferon therapy;

verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating therapy Fertility - Based on findings in animals and humans, male fertility may be compromised by treatment; azoospermia or oligospermia has been observed in men; before initiating therapy, inform male patients about the possibility of sperm conservation Contraception - Females of reproductive potential: Use effective contraception during and for at least 6 months after therapy - Males of reproductive potential: Use effective contraception during and after treatment for at least 1 year Animal data - Drugs that affect DNA synthesis, such as hydroxyurea, may be potential mutagenic agents - Hydroxyurea administration to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis produced embryotoxic and teratogenic effects at doses 0.8 times and 0.3 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily dose - In rats and rabbits, fetal malformations were observed with partially ossified cranial bones, absence of eye sockets, hydrocephaly, bipartite sternebrae, and missing lumbar vertebrae - Embryotoxicity was characterized by decreased fetal viability, reduced live litter sizes, and developmental delays Lactation Not recommended during treatment Unknown whether hydroxyurea is excreted in human milk, the effects of hydroxyurea on the breastfed child, or the effects of hydroxyurea on milk production Pregnancy Categories A: Generally acceptable.

Positive evidence of human fetal risk. X: Do not use in pregnancy. Risks involved outweigh potential benefits. Safer alternatives exist. NA: Information not available. Pharmacology Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which hydroxyurea produces its cytotoxic and cytoreductive effects is not known. However, various studies support the hypothesis that hydroxyurea causes an immediate inhibition of DNA synthesis by acting as a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor, without interfering with the synthesis of ribonucleic acid or of protein. The mechanisms by which hydroxyurea produces its beneficial effects in patients with sickle cell anemia (SCA) are uncertain. Known pharmacologic effects of hydroxyurea that may contribute to its beneficial effects include increasing hemoglobin F levels in red blood cells (RBCs), decreasing neutrophils, increasing the water content of RBCs, increasing deformability of sickled cells, and altering the adhesion of RBCs to endothelium.

Patient Handout hydroxyurea oral HYDROXYUREA ORAL (hi-DROX-ee-you-REE-uh) COMMON BRAND NAME(S): Droxia, Hydrea, Siklos WARNING: This medication decreases bone marrow function, an effect that may lead to a low number of blood cells such as red cells, white cells, and platelets. This effect can cause anemia, decrease your body's ability to fight an infection, or cause easy bruising/bleeding. Tell your doctor right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: signs of infection (such as sore throat that doesn't go away, cough, fever, chills), easy bruising/bleeding, pale skin, unusual tiredness.Hydroxyurea may cause other cancers (such as secondary leukemia, skin cancer). Protect your skin from the sun. Avoid prolonged sun exposure, tanning booths, and sunlamps. Use sunscreen and wear protective clothing when outdoors. Tell your doctor right away if you notice any symptoms of cancer, such as swollen glands, sudden weight loss, night sweats, or unusual skin growths/moles. USES: This medication is used by people with sickle cell anemia to reduce the number of painful crises caused by the disease and to reduce the need for blood transfusions. Some brands are also used to treat certain types of cancer (such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, squamous cell carcinomas). HOW TO USE: Read the Medication Guide if available from your pharmacist before you start taking hydroxyurea and each time you get a refill.
