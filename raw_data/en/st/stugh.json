Several factors have been responsible for this change: The Great American Fraud series by Samuel Hopkins Adams published in Colliers' in 1905-6; the Ladies' Honie J oiirnal crusade of about the same time; the passage of the National Food and Drugs Act; the activities of federal and of some state health officials; the influence of the Better Business Bureau movement; the awakening of newspaper pub\u00ad lishers to the fact that fraudulent medical advertising tended to destroy public confidence in all advertising-all of these, some of them more or less sporadic and ephemeral, were influential in bringing about the change. But one of the most important factors has been the persistent, week-in and week-out campaign of education and enlightenment waged for nearly thirty years by the American Medical Association through its official organ, The Journal,, and, later, its health journal, Hygeia. The credit for this campaign, so far as it applies to \"patent medicine\" and to quackery, is largely due to Dr. Arthur J. Cramp. He it was who devel\u00ad oped and became director of what is now called the Bureau of Investiga\u00ad tion of the American Medical Association, a department which gathers, and makes available to the public and to the medical profession, informa\u00ad tion on \"patent medicines,\" quackery, and pseudo-scientific medicine. This book reveals the scope and activities of the bureau. As Editor of The Journal for more than a quarter of a century, I had intimate knowledge of the work, of the various problems involved, and of the responsibilities realized and assumed by the Director, Dr. Cramp, who, with the neces\u00ad sary caution, with courage and with unswerving honesty of purpose, carried on until ill health forced him to retire, December 1935. This book, which he has prepared since his retirement, is tangible evidence of his continued interest in a subject that, for the past twenty-nine years, has been his life-work. GEORGE H. SIMMONS. October 1936. PREFACE TO VOLUME III A quarter of a century ago-in 1911-the first volume of \"Nostrums and Quackery\" came from the presses of the American Medical Association. It was a book of five hundred pages and contained practically all of the material on \"patent medicines,\" quackery and pseudo-medicine in general that had appeared in The Journal A. M.A. from 1907 to the date of publication. The book received a good press, being extensively reviewed both in medical and lay publications. As a result, the edition was exhausted in a few months and a second edition of the first volume containing some two hundred additional pages appeared in Janu~ry, 1913. It is now out of print. \u00b7 Eight years later-in 1921-enough material had accumulated to make another book and Volume II was brought out. This was a book of some eight hundred pages set in wider measure than the first volume and containing a large amount of material. It did not contain any of the material that had appeared in Volume I, but it did have a duplex index listing the subjects in both Volume I and Volume II. By 1930, more than enough material had accumulated to make another volume, but unfortunately the economic situation at that time made it impractical to get out Volume III. It was not until early in -1936 th~t it was feasible to prepare the third volume of \"Nostrums and Quackery\" which constitutes this book. Here again, no attempt has been made to duplicate material and with very few exceptions products, persons or concerns dealt with in this book have not been dealt with in Volume I or V {)lume II. The few exceptions comprise those cases in which later material has acclimulated and made it necessary to duplicate the reference. The present volume differs fundamentally from the previous volumes. In the first and second volumes, the articles as they had appeared in The Journal A. M.A. were republished in full. It has always been the aim in the preparation of such articles not merely to give the bare facts but to show in some detail the methods by which the faddist, the quack or the nostrum exploiter works. In other words, it has seemed just as important to explain in detail the ways that are dark and the tricks that are vain of the medical faker as it is to give such facts as might be developed in any individual case. Unfortunately, the amount of material that has accumulated since 1921 has made it quite impractical to use this method in preparing the present volume. Those who are interested in the methods as distinguished from the products or results of the faddist, the quack or the \"patent medicine\" maker must be referred to Volume II of \"Nostrums and Quackery\" which is still available, or to the many inexpensive pamphlets prepared and issued by the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association. The present volume is mainly a factual record. Only in certain cases has it been necessary to deal in some detail with the facts set forth. The material that makes up this book is a condensation by the author of longer and more detailed articles prepared by him between 1921 and 1936 and published in The Jottrnal A. M. A., Hygeia, the many pamphlets issued by the Bureau of Investigation and one or two of several that appeared in the American Mercury. Many of the original articles were based on investigation \u00b7made by the author in his capacity of Director of the Bureau of Investigation, supplemented when necessary by analytical work done by the American Medical Association Chemical Laboratory. Other articles here condensed had for their basis some of the splendid vi PREFACE work of the federal authorities, especially that done by the officials of the Food and Drug Administration, who enforce the National Food and Drugs Act of 1906, and by the Solicitor's Office of the Post Office Department. In but few instances have the articles had for their basis work done by state officials for it is unfortunately a fact that but few of the states make any effort to protect their citizens against the wiles of the medical faddist, the quack or the \"patent medicine\" exploiter. It is often ~barged-wholly without justification-that the medical profession's opposition to quackery and nostrum exploitation is motivated by self-interest. The facts are that if the medical profession looked at the \"patent medicine\" business from a dollars-and-cents viewpoint it would raise no opposition to it for, next to the \"patent medicine\" maker himself and the newspapers that take such a large share of the nostrum triaker's profit, ther~ is no other social group that is so widely benefited as the medical profession by \"patent medicine\" advertising. Every piece of advertising devised to convince the public that a pain in the lower part of the back means kidney disease will send, probably, as many people to the family physician as it will send to the drug counter. The medical profession is not opposed to the \"patent medicine\" industry because it cuts into its income\u00ad for it doesn't-but because it is inimical to public health. The chapters that go to make up this book comprise an arbitrary list. The material dealing with many of the products, concerns or individuals in a given chapter might with equal logic have appeared in some other chapter. References will be found at the end of practically every item giving the source of the informa\u00ad tion contained in that item. The excellent work done by the Food and Drug Administration, whether under that, its present name, or some other earlier name, has been heavily called on in making up this volume. Such information regarding \"patent medicines\" that have been declared misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act of 1906 is given in bulletins issued by the Department of Agriculture lmown as Notices of Judgment. These are numbered and dated. Such references have been abbre\"{iated thus: (N. J. 21586; 1934.) This means that the facts given appeared in a Notice of Judgment numbered 21586, issued in 1934. It should be borne i~ mind that the date of issuance of a Notice of Judgment is always later, and not infrequently considerably later, than the date on which the product was seized by the federal authorities. An entire chapter has been given to some of the investigations in the field of pseudo-medicine carried on by the Post Office Department in its efforts to protect the public against medical frauds carried on through the instrumentality of the United States mails. The work of other officials is also credited in terms that call for no interpretation. Something should be said here of the efforts that are being made and have been made for some years past by the National Better Business Bureau and its affiliated local Better Business Bureaus in furthering the cause of Truth in Adver\u00ad tising. It is an axiom with those familiar with advertising problems that there is more misrepresentation and downright fraud in the field of \"patent medicine\" advertisements than in that of any other industry. The Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association has for some years worked in 'Close cooperation with the Better Business Bureaus, not only furnishing them factual data but also, when asked, expressing opinions on the claims made by advertisers in the medical field. This cooperation has worked not only for the good of reputable advertisers but also has given added protection to the public. The author wishes to acknowledge his indebtedness to Mr. Bliss 0. Halling\u00ad who is, and for many years has been, assistant director of the Bureau of Investi\u00ad gation of the American Medical Association-for his valuable assistance in the preparation of this little book. ARTHUR J. CRAMP. INTRODUCTION Voltaire's dictum, that the charlatan was born when the first knave met the first fool, was but a half-truth. Quackery is rampant in many fields-in religion, in politics, in literature, in economics, in medicine. As Voltaire had the medical field in mind when he visioned his epigram, he must stand corrected, for it is not the juxtaposition of knavery and foolishness that gives birth to the quack but that of the knavery and the ignorance. Credulity is bred less by a lack of brains than by a dearth of knowledge. We are all credulous when we wander in fields that are strange to us. Knowledge, rather than intelligence, is the best antidote for credulity. The quack who knows how to word his appeal can gull the intelligentsia as easily as he can fool the illiterate. Talley\u00ad rand boiled down the philosophy of the quack in the statement: \"To succeed in this world it is much more necessary to possess the penetra\u00ad tion to discover who is the ignoramus than to discover who is the wise man.\" In the field of medicine human credulity learns little from experience. In the purchase of any kind of merchandise, except that sold for the alleged alleviation or cure of disease, the buyer has a chance of learning eventually whether or not he has been swindled. In the purchase of an automobile, a piano, or a suit of clothes, time will prove whether it was a good or a bad bargain; nature, through its agencies of wear\u00ad and tear, makes clear whether one has been cheated. But when we go into the market to buy medicament or medical service, we are at sea for here we have nature not as an assistant to aid our judgment but as an opponent to confuse it. In from 80 per cent to 85 per cent of all cases of human ailments, it is probable that the individual will get well whether he does something for his indisposition or does nothing for it~ The healing power of nature-vis medicatrix naturm-fortunately fot biologic perpetuity, works that way. The seller of medicaments, then, obviously starts with at least an eighty per cent chance in his favor. The pills and panaceas of today are colloquially, but incorrectly, . called \"patent medicines\"; incorrectly, because among the thousands of remedies offered to the public for the self-treatment of disease there are probably not half a dozen that are really patented. The reasons are not far to seek. The United States Patent Office is not supposed to grant a patent on a product unless it can be shown that the article on which protection is sought is a new and useful invention. This simple requirement is sufficient in itself to prevent practically all so-called \"patent medicines\" from being patentable. But even were these package medicines patentable, it is not probable that the concerns that market them would apply for a patent. In the first place, a patent, if granted, would give the patentee a monopoly for viii INTRODUCTION only seventeen years, after which time any one might make and sell the preparation. But the main reason that the exploiter of package medi\u00ad cines would not patent his product, even were he able to, is that, in doing so, he would abandon the most cherished asset of the \"pills\" business\u00ad secrecy. Take away from the \"patent medicine\" industry secrecy, and the mystery which goes with it, and you have undermined the founda\u00ad tions on which this monument to human gullibility is raised. For, in applying for a patent on a medicine, one must lay cards on the table, face up! If a patent is granted on a medicine, the names and quantities of the ingredients and the methods of combining these ingredients become a matter of public record, a copy of which any one can obtain from the Commissioner of Patents. But the unknown always inspires awe, and here we have the explanation of the strenuous efforts, so far universally successful, on the _part of manufacturers of \"patent medi\u00ad cines\" to fight every attempt on the part of the public to require a declaration of the ingredients and their quantities on their nostrums. \u00b7 But in addition to the mystery which secrecy permits, there is another equally potent reason for the refusal of the \"patent medicine\" maker to make known his formula. It is a reason that the trade does not broadcast to the public, but occasionally discusses in camera. Some years ago, the City of New York was considering passing an ordinance that would require \"patent medicine\" makers to make known the active ingredients of their preparations. A drug journal, representing the \"patent medicine\" interests, sent a letter to druggists, urging them to refuse to obey such a law and, in the course of this letter, said: \"It is practically impossible to prove that the therapeutic claims, made for a preparation whose composition is not known, are 'false and fraudulent' . . . once, however, they are given the formulas, they can get as many doctors as is necessary to testify that the preparations made according thereto are not good for the diseases for which they are recommended.'' This, of course, was merely another way of saying that, while the claims we make for our products may be fraudulent, so long as we .keep the composition secret it will be difficult for the courts to convict us. The letter closed with the statement that the manufacturers who foolishly declare the composition of their products \"will be supplying evidence which may result in their own undoing.\" The arguments which the \"patent medicine\" makers advance to the public against formula disclosure are to the effect, first, that the formulas are their property and something that the state may not con\u00ad fiscate, and, second, that publishing their formulas would give com\u00ad petitors the opportunity of duplicating their products and destroying their business. Both arguments are fallacious. There is not a \"patent medicine\" on the market today that cannot be analyzed with sufficient accm:acy so that any manufacturer, who wants to do so, can duplicate ~t. This fact is known not only to the \"patent medicine\" makers themselves but also to every physician and every druggist. One conscientious druggist of New York City, who had received a copy of the letter just INTRODUCTION ix referred to, answered it by pointing out that no manufacturer pro\u00ad ducing an honest product should object to obeying a law that was obviously in the public interest. He then made this statement : \"That you are afraid of revealing the nature of your preparations to your com\u00ad petitors is absurd. There is no preparation on your list that cannot be matched or bettered by one in the National Formulary or the\u00b7 United States Pharmacopeia. The sale of your preparations, and of others like them, depends on advertising and not on therapeutic value.\" The argument that the composition of a medicine that is sold for general consumption is no one's business but the manufacturer's is a mid-Victorian concept. In fact, in a burst of unexpected candor, a journal devoted to the \"patent medicine\" interests admitted, as long ago as 1922, that \"patent medicine\" makers assign an altogether exag\u00ad gerated importance to the secrecy which they throw around their prepara\u00ad tions. In an editorial entitled \"Formulre and Secrecy,\" this \"patent medicine\" organ said : . \"It should be remembered j that while a developed formula has a great value, it is the trade name; the advertising, the merchandising skill applied in comzection with it that creates its valuable good-will. [Italics mine-A. J. C.] Ten to one a thorough search through books of formulre will reveal that your own is already known to the medical world. But no one can get the same benefit from it that you have gained unless they spend in merchandising it the same money you have spent.\" Elsewhere in the same editorial, it was admitted that \"the ingredients of some of the biggest selling, proprietary medicines are duplicated in one way or another by imitators. Usually without profit.\" In other words, as the medical profession has insisted for years, the composition of the average \"patent medicine\" is usually the least commercially valuable thing about it. The real thing of commercial value is the name, which the manufacturer protects by a perpetual monopoly granted under the trade-mark law. Pink dishwater, if put on the market under some fancy name (trade-marked), could, by persistent and insistent adver\u00ad tising, be built up into a commercially valuable \"patent medicine.\" It is true that if it were nothing but pink dish-water, only advertising could keep it alive. Add a stiff dash of alcohol, or some equally intriguing drug, to the mixture and the composition alone might keep it moving after momentum had been given it by advertising. The claim long made by \"patent medicine\" makers that they have to keep the composition of their nostrums \u00b7secret in order to protect themselves is buncombe because every \"patent medicine\" maker knows that his preparation can be duplicated. Coming back again to the question of patenting: The manufacturer of package medicines has found a much simpler way of protecting his interests and retaining the secrecy so necessary to the continuance of his business. He give~ to his mixture of drugs a fanciful name and then registers that name as a trade-mark. As such trade-marks are good for twenty years and can be renewed indefinitely, they become X . INTRODUCTION what is essentially a perpetual monopoly. In granting a trade-mark, the government asks for no information regarding the composition of the thing to which the mark is applied. The product may, and frequently does, change in composition but the name, like Tennyson's brook, goes on forever. The property value of a \"patent medicine\" lies in the trade-marked name and to the manufacturer the name is all-important. The composi\u00ad tion of the product itself is an incident. Should the price of ingredients go up, he may substitute cheaper ingredients. Should state or federal laws prove irksome because of the composition, he may change the com\u00adposition. A publication devoted to the \"patent medicine\" business some years ago advertised a name for sale-not a thing. The thing could be formulated at leisure. When one buys a \"patent medicine,\" he buys a name, not a thing. A favorite argument of the nostrum exploiters, advanced when threatened with restrictive legislation, is that \"patent medicines\" are \"the poor man's medicine.\" Never had a pretension a flimsier basis of fact. But a certain portion of the public can be counted on to accept as gospel any prep_osterous statement if only it be repeated often enough and_ in sufficiently black type. The purchaser who buys a bottle of Dr. Quack's Quick Cure does not realize that about 75 cents of his dollar has been expended by Dr. Quack in an effort to convince him that he is suffering from something for which \"Quick Cure\" is a sure-shot remedy. The most expensive thing about a \"patent medicine\" is the advertising. As one \"patent medicine\" maker said, when, in a burst of candor, he was speaking before others of his kind: \"The twenty thousand newspapers of the United States make more money from advertising the proprietary medicines than do the proprietors of the medicines themselves. . . Of their receipts, one-third to one-half goes for advertising.\" If, on the admission of the manufacturers, from 33 cents to 50 cents of a dollar paid for a \"patent medicine\" goes to the newspapers, the additional cost of exploitation in \"almanacs,\" radio programs, cir\u00ad culars and other publicity features can easily be counted on to bring the amount up to 75 cents. And the farce-or tragedy-of the whole thing is that John Doe pays this 75 cents not knowing that it has been expended for the purpose of persuading him that he is suffering from some ailment for which the nostrum is recommended. Every physician and every druggist knows that \"patent medicines\" are unnecessary. They know that there are already available official products more than ample to fill every legitimate need of self-drugging; that is, to furnish all the \"home remedies\" that can safely be used by the public. These official products, being nonsecret and their strength and purity being guaranteed under both federal and state laws, are in every way superior to the proprietary article of secret composition. Moreover, there being no element of monopoly or proprietorship, in the narrow sense, in the manufacture of these official products, competition may be counted on to keep the price down to a reasonable figure. Thus, the INTRODUCTION xi small margin of profit on the sale of official products makes it impos\u00ad sible for such preparations to be sold by intensive advertising methods and their open formula makes false and fraudulent therapeutic claims unfeasible. The abolition of \"patent medicine\" advertising would do much to abolish the making of hypochondriacs by suggestion and would result in a great decrease in all drug taking. In addition to this large indirect financial saving, there would be a direct saving in that when John Doe purchased a simple home remedy he would pay only for the actual cost of the medicine plus a legitimate \"overhead\" to cover production and distribution. It is a demonstrable fact that if the public depended on a few of the official products for their home remedies instead of on the multitudinous \"patent medicines,\" they could save 75 cents on every dollar now expended. Before a druggist may dispense drugs, he must have studied for some years, been graduated in pharmacy and passed an examination given by the state. Before a physician may prescribe drugs, he too must have studied several years, have graduated in medicine and passed an examination given by the state. But any ignoramus can both prescribe and dispense deadly poisons to the public with practically no let or hindrance, provided he does it under the guise of selling \"patent medicines.\" The great need of the public today is either a new national law to protect it against frauds in medicine and foods or else an extension of the powers of the present law. It is the personal opinion of the author of this book, based on nearly thirty years' intensive study of the \"patent medicine\" evil, that there is much to be said for the suggestion that if the National Food and Drugs Act of 1906 had its powers extended the public could be much better protected. The law of 1906 as it stands leaves much to be desired; first, the law is woefully weak in that it applies only tq such \"patent medicine\" advertising as appears on or in the trade package. The \u00b7fraudulent \"patent medicine\" exploiter is little concerned with being held down to truthful statements on. or in the trade package for these are not what sells his stuff. So long as he can lie in his collateral advertising-newspapers, billboards or radio-\u00adhe is quite content to say as little as possible on his trade package, which the public does not see until its money has gone over the counter. The law should be extended to cover all advertising dealing with the products dealt with by the. law. The present law is weak, also, in that it requires the declaration of the presence and amount of only eleven drugs out of the hundreds or thousands that can be used. When the public becomes its own doctor, it has a right to the same information that the physician has; namely, a knowledge of the drugs which make up the medicine. The 1906 law should have its powers extended to require the names and amounts of all drugs that enter into any \"patent medicine\" and for which therapeutic action is claimed. xii INTRODUCTION The 1906 law limits its definition of \"drug\" to substances which are used for the cure or alleviation of disease. This exempts from the law's application all cosmetics, some of which may and \u00b7do contain dangerous drugs. The definition of what constitutes a drug should be extended so as to include cosmetics. All of these added powers could, it would seem, be given to the 1906 law and would make it increasingly difficult for certain \"patent medicine\" exploiters and cosmetic manufacturers to be as great a menace to the public health as they are at present. The advantage of modifying the 1906 law instead of drawing up an entirely new law would be that the old law has been through the courts and its powers and limitations are a matter of record. Yet the present year of grace does not seem a favorable one for national legislation that would strengthen the Food and Drugs Act and make it possible to control fraudulent advertising. Commercial morals are largely dominated by dividends. When reputable adver\u00adtising is easy to get, decent publications exhibit a decided independence in the acceptance or rejection of patent medicine \"copy.\" When hard times come, when advertising linage is difficult to obtain, when com\u00ad petition becomes acutely keen, then the standard of all advertising falls. Even the most superficial observer can recognize that many newspapers and magazines that prior to the economic cataclysm of 1929 exercised a rather rigid censorship of medical copy now seem to be willing to accept anything in the way of advertising that will not bar them from the second-class mailing privileges. Some magazines that thirty years ago did much to mold public opinion and bring about the passage of the National Food and Drugs Act are today carrying \"patent medicine\" advertisements in their pages ! Yet it is probably no exaggeration to state that, were it commercially possible to reject all \"pate_nt medicine\" advertising and still make a reasonable profit on their investments, few proprietors of newspapers or magazines would accept medical \"copy.\" But the economic pendulum will in time complete its swing and decent newspapers and magazines again will throw their influence in the public's interest. Possibly, too, a Utopian period may arrive when cer\u00ad tain radio stations will cleanse the ether of some of the medical mis\u00adrepresentation that now pollutes it. When that time comes, we may look with some hopefulness toward a national law that will make it just as legally dangerous to falsify in any medical advertising as it is, under the present law, to make false or fraudulent statements on or in the trade package.

This may explain why there is such an enormous number of alleged remedies for hay fever and asthma on the American market. Analysis has shown that about nine out of every ten \"patent medicines\" sold for the alleged cure of asthma or hay fever contain either iodides or arsenic or both. Iodides have been used for years by the medical profession in the treatment of certain forms of asthma, but self-dosing with iodides is by no means free from danger. The risk of taking \u00b7arsenic would be obvious if the public were aware of the presence of the substance in the products taken. But, as the National Food and Drugs Act does not require the declaration of the presence of arsenic, the purchaser of an asthma or hay fever \"patent medicine\" is wholly in the dark as to the possible presence of this powerful drug. Asthma-Sera.-The R. M. B. Laboratories of Seattle, Wash., put on the market an alleged cure for asthma and hay fever known as \"Asthma-Sera.\" The product was sold under the claim that : \"Only Asthma-Sera, which is an internal medicine, can overcome your troubl6 permanently . . .\" The preparation was a brown liquid that came in a six-ounce bottle. Four bottles comprised a \"full treat\u00ad ment\" and were sold for $10.50. When analyzed by the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., the preparation was found to be essentially iodides and a laxative. From the analysis the Laboratory computed that each teaspoonful of Asthma-Sera con\u00ad tained the equivalent of : strontium iodide, 5.9 grains ; sodium iodide, 0.3 grains and a laxative. The same old fake; iodides and a laxative I That iodides will be effective in certain forms of asthma is, of course, well known to every physician. Strontium iodide has no advantage over sodium or potassium iodide and, while used to some extent some years ago, has long since been abandoned in the light of experimental and clinical experience. Yet the exploiters of Asthma-Sera sold their product under the claim that it was a new treatment discovered by a French physician and never before used in Canada or the United States in the combination found I When the public's money can be extracted so easily is it any wonder that mail-order quackery has a lure?-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 11, 1928.) Asthma-Tabs.-This was sold through the mails by the Asthma-Tabs Labora\u00ad tory of Kansas City, Mo. The individuals making up the so-called \"Laboratories\" were four in number : One of them was said to be connected with a printing concern ; another had been an advertising man in the women's clothing field ; the third was a contractor and builder, while the fourth was said to have been employed previously as a chemist. Part of the Asthma-Tabs advertising bally-hoo consisted of the reproduction of a letter purported to be on the stationery of a bank in Kansas City, Mo. and to have been written by the vice-president of that institution. Asthma-Tabs was advertised in certain newspapers and magazines under such claims as: \"Kills Hay Fever and Asthma Germs in Three Days.\" \"Famous New 2 ASTHMA, HAY FEVER .REMEDIES Discovery, Asthma-Tabs, Succeeds After Everything Else Had Failed.\" \"If you are short of breath, at night-this wounderful new dis\u00ad .covery will remove these troubles in a few days.\" The method of exploitation was typical of mail-order quackery with the usual follow-up system with form letters and a sliding scale of prices ranging from $5.00, first asked, down to $1.00. Asthma-Tabs came as the name would indi\u00ad cate in the form of tablets, each tablet weighing between 7\u00be and 8 grains. When analyzed by the A~ M. A. Chemical Laboratory, each tablet was found to contain the equivalent of : Potassium iodide, 5\u00be grains ; potassium sulfate, 2\u00bd grains and arsenic trioxide, \u00bd20 grain. The dose recom\u00ad mended was three tablets a day or the equivalent of over sixteen grains of potassium iodide, nearly seven grains of potassium sulfate and one-fortieth of a grain of arsenic trioxide. Although the product contained both potassium iodide and arsenic, two drugs that may easily be both harm\u00ad ful and dangerous when used unknowingly, the preparation was advertised to \"contain no harmful drugs.\" The postal authorities, after an investigation and hearing at Washing\u00ad ton, declared the Asthma-Tabs Laboratories fraudulent and on Dec. 12, 1925, an order was issued debarring them from the use of the United States mails.-(Co,ulensed from The Jountal A. M. A., Sept. 27, 1924, cnul Jan. 16, 1926~) Ercolin.-This \"patent medicine\" was put on the market by the Smith-Ernster Laboratories, Inc., of New York City. \"Ercolin\" was described as an \"entirely new physiological compound\" which \"reacts on the protein of the pollen, thereby neutralizing the effect of ALL pollens.\" Ercolin was advertised under such claims as: \"Hay Fever Washed Away Instantly.\" \"Hay Fever Conquered in One Minute.\" The claim was made in a circular accompanying the trade package that \"The Ercolin formula had been analyzed and approved by the Massachusetts Board of Pharmacy.\" A letter was written to the Massachusetts Board of Registration and Pharmacy and the reply came back that the statement relative to Ercolin was untrue. The A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory was asked to analyze Ercolin. The chemists reported that from their analyses it was concluded that Ercolin was essentially a solution containing approximately a little over one-half of one per cent of gallic acid to which had been added a relatively small amount of glycerin. This was the product described as a \"marvelous remedy,\" perfected by an \"eminent Boston scientist\" as the result \"of years of effort\"-a weak solution of gallic acid in dilute glycerin.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Feb. 23, 1929.) Florence Formula.-This was sold on the mail-order plan by the Florence Product Corporation of Kansas City, Mo. The methods employed in its sale were those common to most mail-order quackery : Advertisements in not-too\u00ad particular newspapers and magazines, follow-up letters and a sliding scale of prices. The stuff was analyzed by the A. M. A. in its laboratory and, like so many \"patent medicines\" sold as alleged cures for asthma and hay fever, it was found to contain arsenic and iodides. When this product was first dealt with in February 1926, the hope was expressed that the efficient but overworked branch of the gov\u00ad ernment that issues fraud orders would in due time get around to the Florence Product Corporation and debar it from the use of the United States mails. On July 2, 1926 the Florence Formula Corporation was declared a fraud by the Post Office Department and the mails closed to it. In their investigation the postal --------- \u00b7\u00b7-------- ASTHMA, HAY FEVER REMEDIES 3 authorities found that the gross receipts from this piece of quackery were about $75,000 a year.-(Co,zdeuscd from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 6, 1926 and Jan. 29, 1927.) Free Breath.-This preparation was marketed from Benton Harbor, Mich., by the 0. W. Dean Company, Inc., previously known as the Benton Asthma Remedy Company. Free Breath was described as \"the World's Wonder Treatment for Asthma, Bronchitis, Hay Fever and Catarrh of the Mucous Membranes.\" The methods by which Free Breath was exploited were those that are classic to m~l-. order quackery : Contacts between the \"patent medicine\" concern and the sufferer were made through the advertising pages of certain newspapers and magazines ; the formula for the product was alleged to have been given to Dean by a friend; free \"trial treatments\" were part of the advertising come-on. While it was claimed that Free Breath was \"perfectly harmless,\" the facts were that each teaspoonful of the preparation contained 3 drops of Fowler's solution (arsenic trioxide) and 2\u00bd grains of potassium iodide. The price first asked for a \"complete treatment\" was $18. This was reduced by easy stages in the series of follow-up letters, first to $6, later to $5, and finally to $3.-(Condenscd from The Journal A. M.A., No'!), 27, 1926.) Histeen.-This was put on the market by the Histeen Corporation of Chicago. The business was one of several pieces of quackery operated from the same address aud listed under the same telephone number. The Histeen advertising declared that hay fever and pollen asthma are due to histamine poison and claimed that Histeen was a compound which would \"counteract histamine poisons.\" It was also advertised that Histeen was the alleged discovery of a \"Chicago Specialist\" who was said to be a \"member of the A. M. A.\" When asked to give the nam~ of the alleged \"specialist,\" the Histeen Corporation refused to do so claiming that when it entered into negotiations with the \"specialist\" it was with the understanding that the \"specialist's\" name would never be divulged. This, according to the Histeen Corporation, was \"solely for the purpose of protecting the physician's ethical standing.\" Just why an ethical physician would be unwilling to have his activities known, unless indeed these activities were unethical, was not explained. From the thesis of the Histeen advertising, those familiar with the research that has been done in the field of hay fever and pollen asthma might have expected Histeen to carry as its chief ingredient some substance such as histaminase. When Histeen was analyzed, however, in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory, it was found to have essentially the following composition : Antipyrine, 4 grains ; pheno\u00ad barbital (luminal), 0.2 grain; ephedrine hydrochloride, 0.12 grain. Based on the dosage recommended, those who purchased Histeen might be taking forty-eight grains of antipyrine, nearly two and one-half grains of phenobarbital and nearly one and one-half grains of ephedrine hydrochloride daily. In view of this, it was not surprising to learn that one Chicago sufferer from asthma who started taking Histeen died suddenly. There were also reports from pharmacists and physicians of other cases of serious untoward effects following the use of this nostrum. In September 1934 the federal authorities charged that the stuff was misbranded because of fraudulent curative claims and because it was labelled: \"non-habit forming.\" Summed up, Histeen was a secret mixture of three well-known drugs, all of them potentially dangerous, and it was recommended in dosages that a physician with any regard for his patients' safety and his own reputation would hesitate to prescribe.-(Co11dcnsed from The Journal A. M. A., Oct. 14, 1933 with additions.) Nacor.-The Nacar Medicine Company of Indianapolis put this on the market. The company had for its president and treasurer one L. M. Haymann and for its vice-president and secretary, Haymann's wife. While Haymann was not a medical man, he had had previous training in mail-order quackery with a crude consumption 4 ASTHMA, HAY FEVER REMEDIES cure fake sold on the mail-order plan and known as \"Nature's Creation.\" Originally Nature's Creation, put on the market by a woman who had been a fortune teller in a Chicago basement, was sold first as an absolute cure for syphilis and later as a cure for tuberculosis. When analyzed in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory, Nature's Creation was found to be a solution of potassium iodide in alcohoi Jlnd water with vegetable extractives and flavoring. The Bureau of Investigation\u00b7 of the A. M. A. first exposed Nature's Creation as a fraud in 1910. Later, following a more detailed investigation, there was published a long and gruesome list of persons who had died after taking the stuff. When N acor was analyzed by the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory it, like Nature's Creation, was found to be a liquid containing potassium iodide, alcohol, water and vegetable extractives.-( C o,zdensed from The Journal A. M.A., Sept. 24, 1932.) Raz-Mah.-Templeton's Inc. of Detroit and Templeton's, Ltd., of Toronto put this product on the United States and Canadian markets, respectively. The alleged origin of Raz-Mah varied according to whether one purchased the product in Canada or in the United States. The story given to those who purchased Raz\u00ad Mah in the United States was to the effect that the writer of the circular had for ten years suffered with hay fever or summer asthma, had tried innumerable treat\u00ad ments but got no relief until finally a \"chemist friend\" suggested that he try a mixture which was later put on the market as Raz-Mah. The Canadian circular stated that J. G. Templeton, after \"perfecting the formula for his rheumatic remedy,\" began to devote his time to finding a specific for asthma and that Raz\u00ad Mah was the treatment that he evolved. You paid your money and you took your choice. Raz-Mah came in the form of capsules and the chemists of the A. M. A. were asked to tear aside the veil of secrecy that hid the true ingredients of this pharmaceutical marvel from the multitude. They did so. Raz-Mah was reported to be nothing more mysterious than our old friend, aspirin, mixed with a little charcoal and caffeine.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 28, 1925.) Rinex.-\"Dr. Flatt's Rinex Prescription\" was advertised and recommended for \"Asthma, Catarrh, Hay Fever, Rose Fever, Bronchitis, and Other Throat Affec\u00ad tions.\" Rinex came in the form of capsules containing a brownish powder together with some yellowish-white tablets, each package containing twice as many capsules as tablets. When analy~eq by the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory, the essential ingredients of each, capsule were found to be approximately : Aspirin, 2 grains ; phenacetine, 1 grain; quinine, 1/6 grain. The tablets were composed of three\u00ad fourths baking soda and one-fourth sugar. In August 1934 the stuff was declared misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act because of fraudulent curative claims and because the phenacetine was not properly declared.-(Condensed from Tlie Journal A. M. A., April 11, 1925; with additio11s.) Tucker's Asthma Specific.-For many years this was put out from Mount Gilead, Ohio. One Dr. Nathan Tucker was the originator. The preparation was sold on the mail-order plan and the label admitted the presence of five grains of cocaine to the fluid ounce. Tucker's Asthma Specific was analyzed at various times by reputable independent chemists who reported finding substantial amounts of cocaine~ Cases of cocaine poisoning following the use of the stuff were also reported in medical literature. In 1910 the United States Department of Agricul\u00ad ture issued a bulletin on \"Habit-Forming Agents\" and specifically warned against Tucker,s Asthma Specific. In later years, following Tucker's death, the exploiters claimed that the preparation, before it reached the public, underwent certain changes that caused the cocaine to be hydrolyzed. Nevertheless the label continued to declare the presence of five grains of cocaine to the fluid ounce. The sale of ASTHMA, HAY FEVER REMEDIES 5 Tucker's remedy would seem to have been an obvious violation of 011e or both of two federal laws. If it contained no cocaine, then it was a misbranding under the _/' \u00b7' National Food and Drugs Act for the label to declare the presence of five grains / of cocaine to the fluid ounce. If it did contain cocaine or even a derivative of cocaine, then its method of sale would seem to have violated the Harrison Narcotic Law. In 1911 the Department of Agriculture proceeded against Tucker's Asthma Specific, declaring the stuff misbranded, first, because it contained cocaine and the label bore no \u00b7statement of the content or the proportion of that drug as is required by law and, second, because the stuff was not a specific. Tucker was found guilty on the first count and was fined $150 and costs. Since that time no federal action seems to have been taken against this product.-(Ce1tule1ised from The. Journal A.

CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS \"Secret cures can never be what they promise, for there is no one scien\u00ad tifically trained or susceptible to the ordinary demands of the human conscience who would withhold for his private means such an important matter as the discovery of the cure of this disease.\" ~--------~ For years hardly a week has passed when the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association has not received one or more letters in which the writers stated that they had discovered, or had in their possession, a \"sure cure\" for cancer. Some of these letters had every evidence of having been written by persons who were sincere and who, apparently, had no special desire to com\u00ad mercialize their alleged discoveries ; others came froni individuals who were obviously commercial in their outlook and who had no interest in their alleged remedies aside from the money they hoped to make by selling them. All of the writers asked the American Medical Association to investigate their products. In answering these letters, it was explained that the \u00b7number of alleged cures for \u00b7-.cancer brought to the attention of the American Medical Association was so great that it would be a physical and financial impossibility to investigate all of them. Each correspondent was told that before the American Medical Association could undertake to devote time and study to his \"cure,\" it would be necessary for him to fulfil three elemental requirements. These were: 1.-Send in a complete statement of the composition of the remedy, including not only the name but the quantity of each ingredient for which therapeutic action was claimed. It was made clear that such information, if sent to the American Medical Association, would not be accepted in confidence, but would become part of the Association's records, to be passed on to those who might inquire about the product. 2.-Send in the names and addresses of at least twenty-five persons who were claimed to have been cured of cancer by the product in question. 3.-Send in the names and address of the physicians who diagnosed these cases as those of cancer. These three simple requirements were never complied with in a single instance! Some of the best brains in medical research have been for many years seeking the cause of, and finding a treatment for, cancer. As yet, the ultimate cause of cancer has not been discovered. It has been thoroughly demonstrated, however, that cancer, when taken in the early stages, may be cured by competent surgical treatment and, in selected cases, by the use of radium and x-ray. There is no scientific evidence at the present time to show that any serum, drug or combination of drugs will cure cancer. Various kinds of drugs have been employed, both for internal administration and for local administration, by injection or by the application of caustic pastes. The more progressive members of the medical profession have abandoned the use of caustics in the treatment of what are sometimes called \"external\" cancers. The reason is that the action of caustics is not easily controlled and much better results are obtained by the judicious use of surgery, radium and x-ray. There are many institutions of dubious scientific standing that advertise that they are devoted to the cure of cancer. \u00b7 In practically every instance these concerns use caustic or escharotic drugs. Many of them publish imposingly large lists of \"cures.\" Investigation discloses that the great bulk of these \"cures\" have occurred in individuals who have never been proved scientifically to have cancer. Many persons, especially those past middle age, develop benign growths and, feeling that such growths are cancerous, go to these institutions that advertise that they \"do not 8 CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS use the knife.\" They are there told that the condition is cancerous, the growth is burnt out with caustics, the wound 'heals, and the patients go back to their homes as living advertisements for the cure of a cancer-that did not exist l That such concerns may destroy superficial cancers by their caustics and \"plasters\" is, of course, obvious. But such a method of attacking even surface cancers is unscientific, painful to a degree, long drawn-out and, even if all the malignant tissue is removed, is likely to result in much greater disfigurement than that follow\u00ad ing the quicker, cleaner and much less painful surgical removal. In-this chapter there is given in greatly condensed form some of the informa\u00ad tion on \"cures\" and \"treatments\" for cancer that has come to the attention of the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association. These \"cures\" range all the way from palpable frauds through those that smack more of commercialism than of science to those that may be said to represent the optimistic claims of misguided enthusiasts. One should bear in mind that a person with cancer can die just as surely by relying on an honest but misguided enthusiast as by submitting to the malpractice of the most blatant of \"cancer cure\" swindlers. Adler Treatment.-In 1932 the Adler Laboratories, Inc., of Jersey City, N. J., was advertising a mail-order cure for cancer known as the \"Adler Treatment.\" The treatment was alleged to be the discovery of Louis Adler of Newark, N. J., who was described as a \"Hungarian chemist.\" Adler Laboratories, Inc., had Louis Adler for its president, an electrical contractor for its treasurer and two lawyers as vice-president and secretary, respectively. The files of the Bureau of Investiga\u00adtion of the A. M. A. have record of a Louis Adler who, in 1921, was arrested in Newark, N. J., on the charge of violating the medical practice act in the exploitation of an alleged cancer cure. He was, according to the newspaper reports at the time, found guilty and fined $200 and costs. While Louis Adler's so-called Adler Labora\u00ad tories, Inc., had. its headquarters in Jersey City, N. J., Adler himself, from his Newark address, put out a line of \"patent medicines,\" among them being \"Adler's Wonder Salve,\" \"Adler's Blood (which seemed to be another \"cancer cure'') and \"Adler's Stomach Cleanser.\" Of practical interest to the sufferer from cancer was the report on the Adler treatment by Dr. Ira I. Kaplan, Director of the Division of Cancer, Bellevue Hospital, New York City. Dr. Kaplan reported that the Adler treatment was tried in three cases which had been selected by the Adler concern as being most likely not to show harmful results. The treatment was administered in accordance with the directions. Dr. Kaplan reported \"all three patients died horribly and miserably.\"-(Condensed from The lounzal A. M. A., May 27, 1933.) Alphacatalyst.-This was originally known as \"Armstrong's Oxycatalyst\"; later it was called \"Alphacatalyst.\" Inquiries first came about the product in 1927 and in the Bureau of Investigation Department of The Jounial A. M.A. for May 19, 1928 an article was published on the subject. In the article it was brought out that, while the product was alleged to be in the experimental stage, commercial agencies had been established in various parts of the country, doctors were charg\u00ad ing $200 for a single injection,\u00b7 and in other ways the methods of exploitation seemed to smack more of economics than of scientific medicine. Following the publication of the article, Robert A. Armstrong wrote to the Bureau of Investigation in an attempt to defend the methods of exploitation. As to the composition of the prepara\u00ad tion, Mr. Armstrong stated that he was \"perfectly frank in saying to the physician\" that: \"Armstrong's Oxycatalyst contains in part the essential elements of metameric protein devoid of its combustible products, tog.ether with anionic halogens in solution with Alpha particles of Radium derived from fifty micrograms of Radium element together with its derivatives in a normal saline carrier.\" CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS 9 This statement was wholly without meaning, but it was sonorous and carried an imposingly technical tone. In 1929, some specimens of Armstrong's Oxycatalyst were submitted to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory. Although the advertising of the Armstrong product had been based on the claim that the preparation was radioactive, no radio-activity was found in the specimens. The exploiters were just as vague regarding the composition of Alphacatalyst as Armstrong was regarding Oxycatalyst. The only difference between the two was that the later concern used fewer words to conceal thought. According to its booklet : \"The Alphacatalyst is a solution containing a radium derivative, employing as its active principle the Alpha particle of radium. It has been described as a colloidal suspension.\" In spite of the fact that the Alphacatalyst (Oxycatalyst) was put on the market several years ago, there is no scientific evidence to indicate that either had any value.-(Modijied from The Journal A. M.A., May 6, 1933.) Norman Baker.-This man at Muscatine, Iowa, headed a number of mercantile enterprises, including the ownership of a radio broadcasting station and an alleged cancer cure, the radio being used as a means of obtaining victims. The Journal A. M.A. and Hygeia gave the medical profession and the public the facts regarding Baker's cruel business, with the result that Baker brought suit for libel against the A. M. A., asking one-half million dollars in damages. The case came to trial in the federal courts in February 1932 and continued for nearly a month. After all the evidence had been submitted, both by Baker and by the A. M. A.,. the jury decided that Baker had not been libeled when he was called a quack, and returned a verdict for the A. M. A. Baker's original enterprises seemed to have been wholly in the commercial field-selling cigars, radios, storage batteries, alarm clocks, advertising his wares through catalogs, a rather lurid magazine that he called T N T (The Naked Truth) and over his radio station, KTNT. Baker had two fake cures for cancer that were used in Muscatine in a building known as the Baker Hospital. The first was a treatment for \"external\" cancer, an arsenic powder exploited by Harry M. Hoxey, another cancer cure quack who is dealt with else\u00ad where in this book; the second, was a treatment for \"internal\" cancer that Baker got from one Charles 0. Ozias of Kansas City, Mo. When the A. M.A., through its Bureau of Investigation, first began warning the public against the Baker \"cancer cure\" business, Baker made the fantastic charge that the A. M. A. had offered him a million dollars for his \"cancer cure\" in order that it might be with\u00ad drawn from the market so that cancer sufferers would be compelled to resort to surgery, x-ray and radium I When Baker was put on the stand in the libel suit, he denied that he had ever made such a statement, but the A. M. A. offered in evidence a letter signed Norman Baker (and which Baker admitted he had dictated) in which the charge was made. During the trial it was brought out that Baker's monthly receipts for his \"cancer cure\" started at about $1,000 f01,: the month of October 1929, climbed to over $75,000 a month in June 1930, and-following the articles published by the A. M. A.---dwindled until, for the month of January 1932, he took in only about $7,000. The evidence showed that Baker's education had gone no further than a year and a half of high-school work, after which for two years he worked in machine shops. He then went into the vaudeville business, putting on \"hypnotism\" acts. He continued in that field for about eight or ten years, but in 1914 came back to Muscatine, where he started to manufacture cal\u00ad liopes. This work was interrupted for a short time when he again went on the road \"putting on an act.\" In 1920 his factory burned and he then started a mail\u00ad order business. Although Baker admitted that he could not paint, nevertheless he advertised to teach 11oi1 painting in ten lessons by mail.\" His broadcasting station went on the air in November 1925. The Federal Radio Commission in 1931 revoked his broadcasting license because it found his operation of the station 10 CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS inimical to the public interest. In starting in the 11cancer cure\" business, Baker broadcast over his radio station that he wanted five men or women who were suffering from cancer to consent to become test patients and that he would pay all their expenses, including doctors' bills, nurses, care, medical fee, room and board, etc., and that the only expense to which they would be put would 'be the cost of transportation to the hospital. It was brought out at the libel suit trial that, as a matter of fact, practically all the test patients pajd their own expenses, both transportation and fees. Later Baker's magazine, TN T, published an article to prove that results in the five test cases showed that \"Cancer is Conquered.\" Investigation by the A. M. A. disclosed that every one of the five test patients was dead I In spite of this, Baker continued to reprint and distribute the article, stating or implying that the patients were cured, for months after the victims were in their graves. Case after case was brought to the attention of the jury by the A. M. A. of poor victims who had taken the Baker \"treatment\" and were told by the Baker concern that they were cured, but who, in fact, died. One case, not so tragic, was also brought out by the A. M. A.: A young Iowa farmer, suffering from a sore spot on his face that he thought might be cancer and having heard Baker over the radio, went to the Baker Institute, where he was treated for cancer. Not being satisfied that the Baker concern knew much about his case, the young man left Muscatine and went to the Dermatologic Clinic of the State University of Iowa. Here reputable physicians found that he was actually suffering from nothing more serious than \"barber's itch.\"-(Modified from \"Cancer Cures and Treat\u00ad metits,11 1933.) Bohannon Cancer Institute.-The Bohannon Cancer Institute was conducted for some years in Berkeley, Calif. G. C. Bohannon, who conducted the Institute and who was not a graduate of any reputable medical school, after having pleaded guilty to a conspiracy to violate the medical practice act of California, was sentenced to pay a fine of $4,000. The judge who sentenced Bohannon is said to have stated that he would have sent the man to jail, but because Bohannon was an advanced diabetic, a fine was assessed instead. The Bohannon concern seems to have been founded by one J. L. Bohannon, who for some years conducted the Pacific Cancer and Tumor Institute in Oakland, Calif. J. L. Bohannon died in 1914; he was not a graduate in medicine nor was he ever licensed to practice. He was one of the incorporators of the Anti-Vaccination League of Berkeley, Calif. California newspapers in 1910 reported that J. L. Bohannon had been arrested for the illegal practice of medicine and fined $300. Bohannon\u00b7 appealed the case, but lost. The Bohannon treatment was said to consist in injecting a preparation of the escharotic type.-(Modified from \"Cancer C1ires and Treatments,\" 1933.) E. E. Bundy.-This person, a woman of Boise City, Okla., was reported in 1932 as carrying on an extensive \"cancer cure\" business. The treatment seemed to be of the usual caustic\u00b7 type. One physician who wrote regarding this woman's activities reported that he had come in contact with a Bundy victim. The poor patient had an extensive necrosis of the abdominal walls, due to the application of the Bundy plaster, and the post-mortem revealed that the patient had carcinoma of the stomach, colon and liver. Incredible though it may seem, it was reported that early in 1933, an attempt was being made to get the state legislature to grant this woman a special license to practice and also to make an appropriation for a cancer hospital l-(Frona \"Cancer Cures and Treatme,its,\" 1933.) Burnside's Purifico.-Eleanor Elizabeth Howe, who was graduated by the \u00b7New England Female Medical College in 1867, married a preacher by the name of Burnside in 1871 and about 1881 began the manufacture of an alleged cure for cancer known as \"Burnside's Purifico Nos. 1, 2 and 3.\" Many years later-in 1903-the daughter of this woman, Mrs. C. W. Diffin, took over the Purifico CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS 11 business and, with her husband, conducted it under the name of the Purifico Company. This trade name was employed until about September 1920, at which time the \u00b7name of the business was changed to \"C. W. Diffin\" and \"C. W. Diffin Manufacturing Chemist\" at Buffalo and Ashville, N. Y. In 1910 or 1911, the Purifico Company did business from Forestville, N. Y., and apparently conducted a concern known as the Forestville Sanitarium where the nostrums were employed. In November 1917 the Diffins, doing business .as the Purifico Company, were charged by the government with violating the federal Food and Drugs Act in shipping their nostrum. The charge was specifically that the claim that Purifico was an effective remedy for cancer and other conditions was false and fraudulent. The two Diffins pleaded guilty. In May 1923 C. W. Diffin was called on by the postal authorities to show cause why a fraud order should not be issued against him and the Purifico Company. On June 6, 1924, the mails were closed to the Purifico Company and C. W. Diffin of Buffalo and Ashville, N. Y., and Bridgeburg, Ontario, Canada.-(Coudensed from The Journal A. M.A., July 5, 1924.) W. 0. Bye.-William 0. Bye of Kansas City, Mo., was born in 1870 and was graduated in 1897 by Bennett College of Eclectic Medicine and Surgery. Associated with him Bye had one Arthur Heinzelmann, who was graduated in 1907 by the Eclectic Medical University of Kansas City.

Mo. -From some 1933 advertising. name appeared as superintendent of a \"cancer cure\" concern, the Cliff View Sana\u00ad torium of Kansas City, Mo., which advertised the escharotic treatment of cancer. William 0. Bye for many years operated his \"cancer cure\" through the mails ; but the postal authorities in 1910 declared this business a fraud. Bye's brother, Benjamin F., their father, D. M. Bye, and their brother-in-law, L. T. Leach, all four have, at one time or another, operated mail-order \"cancer cures.\" All four of them h,ave claimed to have an alleged \"oil treatment\" for the cure of cancer. When the postal authorities got around to W. 0. Bye and the federal chemists analyzed the nostrums comprising his treatment, it was reported to consist of five different preparations: (1) A mixture of cottonseed oil and almond oil; (2) a product resembling syrup of sarsaparilla; (3) sugar pills; ( 4) vaseline; (5) a clay poultice. Following the issuance of the fraud order against W. 0. Bye, he continued his business by requiring his victims either to come for a personal examination or to have a local physician fill out a card that Bye would furnish, stating that the patient had cancer. Bye for years sent out an advertising J)ooklet entitled \"A Message of Hope.\" In this he led the recipient to believe that opera\u00ad tions and the use of x-ray. and radium in the treatment of cancer are to be avoided. The booklet contained testimonials from persons who were alleged to have been cured of cancer by W. 0. Bye. The edition issued in 1933 was less than half the size of that issued ten years previously-forty-eight pages as compared with one hundred and one pages I In Bye's \"Message of Hope\" sent out in March 12 CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS 1933, this statement was made about the' character of the treatment: \"Our treat\u00ad ment is both local and constitutional in all cases, and is prepared especially for each individual. The local remedies are applied directly to the affected parts in the fonn of oils [Italics mine.-A. J. C.], ointments, powders, pastes, liquids and injections.\"-(Modijied from The Journal A. M.A., June 3, 1933.) Cantassium.-The Cantassium treatment originated in England. There seems to have been a Canadian branch or agent in Toronto. According to the advertising matter, it was \"a treatment by potassium administration\" and consisted in supplying the body with potassium salt, the theory being that cancer is due to a deficiency of potassium in the system. The Cantassium treatment in the United States seemed to be exploited by a California chiropractor.-(From \"Cancer Cures & Treat\u00ad ments,\" 1933.) R. D. Evans.-This man from Brandon, Manitoba, Canada, sold what he alleged was a positive cure for cancer. Like most quacks, he claimed to have made his discovery \"after many years of research and experiments.\" He sold his nostrum for 11One Hundred Dollars in advance.\" From analyses made in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., it appeared that the $100 treatment of Evans consisted essentially of 5 cents' worth of dried copperas (green vitriol), in a dab of lard.\u00ad (Co,idensed from. The Joumal A. M. A., June 3, 1922.) Frasier Formula.-In August 1931 physicians received a letter printed in imitation typewriting on the stationery of one F. S. Kirk, a live stock and real estate auctioneer. Mr. Kirk stated that he had \"a reliable and dependable formula . . . that has positively and permanently removed and cured hundreds of cancers.\" His story was that \"Dr.\" E. A. Frasier (who died in March 1931) had bequeathed him (Kirk) the formula. Elmore A. Frasier was not a graduate of any medical school. Kirk made the following proposition to the physicians to whom he sent his circular letter: If they wanted Dr. Frasier's \"cancer cure\" formula and would sign an agreement not to sell or in any way, directly or indirectly, give away or dispose of the formula or its contents to anyone before the year 1940, they could get a copy of the formula by sending Mr. Kirk $25. Accompanying Mr. Kirk's offer was an advertising booklet of the usual \"cancer cure'' type containing testi\u00ad monials-also of the usual type. The booklet also carried what purported to be a brief biography .of \"Dr.\" Frasier. One fact in the doctor's biography, however, was conspicuous by its absence, not only from the booklet, but from all of the material that Mr. Kirk sent out to physicians, namely, that Frasier himself died of cancer of the lower jaw.-(Condeused from \"Cancer Cures & Treatments,\" 1933.) Gast Sanatorium.-This concern at Prospect, Ohio, seemed to be conducted by one G. F. Gast who, according to the advertising cards, was manager. In a letter written by Gast in 1932, he said: \"My method of treatment for cancer is a plaster.\" Gast was asked in 1932 whether he had any licensed physicians connected with his hospital ; he replied that he had and gave the name of a reputable physician in Prospect. This physician was immediately written to and asked whether there was any truth in this claim. The physician replied that he was in no way connected with the Gast Sanatorium or any similar concern.-(Fro,n 1'Ca,icer Cures & Treatments,\" 1933.) B. H. Green.-This person called himself a cancer specialist and did business from Bessemer, Ala. His nostrum was known as \"B. H. Green's Wild Woods Cancer Preparation and Female Tonic.\" Judging from a letter signed by Green, the man was as illiterate as he was medically ignorant. In April 1931 Dr. J. D. Dowling, County Health Officer for Jefferson County, Ala., reported that B. H. Green had been convicted in the local courts.-(From \"Cancer Cures & Treat- ments,\" 1933.) CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS 13 James M. Harris.-This man, at Tulsa, Okla., exploited a \"cancer cure\" called ''Radium Oil.\" He conducted his business from a farm about two miles outside of Tulsa. The Supreme Court of Oklahoma in 1927 affirmed the judgment of the trial court that had awarded a woman victim $10,000 damages because Harris had treated what, at the outset, was an operable case of cancer of the breast and allowed the matter to progress until it became inoperable. The case came to trial in April, 1924, and the jury awarded the woman $7,500 actual damages and $2,500 exemplary damages; the court rendered judgment accordingly. The poor victim died of cancer in October 1925. Harris, with the effrontery of the quack, appealed the case, but the Supreme Court held that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. The quack then petitioned for a rehearing. The Supreme Court denied it.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Aug. 6, 1927.) David M. Hestand.-This man placed the letters M.D. and D.C. after his name ; he also called himself a \"chiropractor.\" Hestand had a license to practice medicine in Texas. He was said to have entered into a business arrangement with a person who was described as a \"gospel singer, a choir leader and soloist always available for religious meetings.\" Hestand and this man were associated in the \"Hestand Cancer Clinic\" in putting up a twenty-five-bed hospital in Sherman, Texas, that seems to have been known variously as the Chiropractic Hospital of Texas and as the Hestand Hospital. In 1932, Texas newspapers reported that a state charter had been granted to the \"National Society for the Prevention of Cancer\" with D. M. Hestand of Houston as president. In May 1933 Hestand was said to be conducting what he called \"The Hestand Clinic\" at Houston, Texas, and sending out advertising booklets entitled \"CANCER Its Cause-Its Cure.\" Hestand deplored the use of surgery in the treatment of cancer as also the use of x-ray and radium. He used escharotics and stated that his method had as many advantages over surgery, x-ray, etc., \"as an electric light has over a tallow candle.\" He claimed: \"My method of treatment stands alone in the world.\"-(Condensed from \"Cancer Cures & Treatments,\" 1933.) Hoque Cancer Foundation.-The W. F. Hoque Cancer Foundation was operated from Los Angeles. According to a report made by the Board of Medical Examiners of the State of California, members of the Hoque family, none of whom ever seem to have had any medical training, for years exploited a \"cancer cure\" in San Jose, Calif. The treatment is said to have originated with F. Marion Hoque, who died in 1921. In May 1902 F. M. Hoque of San Jose, the vender and manufacturer of an alleged cancer-\u00b7cure salve, was reported to have been found guilty of practicing medicine without a license and in 1908 he was again found guilty on the same charge. In April 1921 it was reported that Mrs. Minnie Hoque had been arrested in San Jose for violation of the medical practice act. In June 1922 Mrs. Minnie Hoque is reported to have called on the State Board of Medical Examiners to complain about her step-son, W. F. Hoque, who, it seems, was operating the Shirley Cancer Institute in Oakland, Calif. At this time, one W. D. Hoque was said to be operating a \"cancer cure\" in San Jose. The state authorities tried several times without success to convict Hoque in the courts of San Jose, but in May 1929 W. F. Hoque was reported as having been found guilty in the Superior Court and fined $500 for violation of the medical practice act. In the spring of 1932, letters were being sent out on the stationery of the \"W. F. Hoque Cancer Foundation\" of Los Angeles, with the name of Herbert Hoque given as business manager and one Peter J. Barone, M.D., as medical director. From vario\u00b5s reports, it appears that the preparations used in the Hoque quackery were escharotics.-(From \"Cancer Cures & Treatments,\" 1933.) 14 CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS Harry M. Hoxsey.-This man exploited an alleged cure for cancer, that was said to have originated with his father, one John C. Hoxsey, who used to dub himself \"Doctor\" Hoxsey, Sr., dabbled in veterinary medicine, faith healing and cancer cures; he died in 1919; cause of death, cancerl Nothing further was heard of his alleged cancer cure until 1924, when the son, Harry M. Hoxsey, with two other men, formed a common law trust having the somewhat imposing name \"National Cancer Research Institute and Clinic,\" with headquarters in Chicago. ANOTHER HOXIOE .

Bonn, L JDHN&ON, BUNTON, DIES AT HOTELHERE While the Hoxide quackery was thriving at Taylorville some gruesome news items appeared in a local paper detailing the deaths of a few of the victims. No wonder the local undertaker was reported as showing enthusiasm about the Hoxide Sanitarium. Later the two men who had been with Hoxsey apparently went with another cancer\u00ad cure fake. Hoxsey went back to central Illinois and established what was known as the Hoxide Institute of Taylorville, Ill. In due time, the Hoxide Institute at Taylorville closed its doors leaving in its wake a string of deaths. In the meantime, the Hoxide Institute entered suit against the A. M. A. and its editor for a quarter of a million dollars. Like so many libel suits brought by those whose methods 16 CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS the patients had died following the Johnson treatment. Later Johnson abandoned his \"cancer cure,, activities and substituted a cure for hemorrhoids (piles).-(Con\u00ad densed from \"Cancer Cures & Treatments,\" 1933.) Koch's Synthetic Anti-Toxin.-In 1919 Dr. William F. Koch of Detroit declared that he had \"developed a real specific cure for cancer.\" This declaration was made less than a year after Dr. Koch had been graduated in medicine and at the time that he was thirty-four years of age. Dr. Koch seems to have claimed that cancer is caused by a germ resembling the spirochete of syphilis, but scientific medicine has never been able to find any basis for such a claim. The Wayne County (Detroit) Medical Society made three carefully controlled investigations of the Koch remedy. Each of the three reports was unfavorable. Koch called his product a \"Synthetic Anti-Toxin\"; a \"synthetic chemical compound of very definite molecular arrangement\" ; a \"difficultly prepared synthetic structure, worked down on a recrystallization process.'' None of these descriptions, while imposingly sonorous, told anything. The composition of the Koch remedy was secret. The Bureau of Investigation of the A. M. A. published several articles on the Koch nostrum, which included some rather gruesome reports of a large number of deaths of cancer victims who had relied on the Koch preparation. In the early part of 1936 Dr. Koch was sending physicians printed letters featuring what he called \"Glyoxylide,\" which was claimed to have \"demonstrated its efficiency not only in the treatment of cancer but also in such infections as tuberculosis, psoriasis, leprosy, poliomyelitis and syphilis.\"~(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A. of various dates.) Lamotte Cancer Institute.-This was conducted in the little village of Garden in the upper peninsula of Michigan. It was founded by a man without medical education, Edward Lamotte, who died in 1925; the son, Edward Lamotte, Jr., carried on the work. In January 1929 Lamotte, Jr., was reported as having been arrested for practicing medicine without a license. According to the reports at the time, a woman with a mole on her face went to Lamotte for examination and he immediately pronounced it cancer and offered to cure it for $75. The Lamotte \"treatment\" was said to be a paste made from herbs and roots.-(From \"Cancer Cures & Treatments,\" 1933.) John Lindgren.-John Lindgren manufactured and sold what he called \"Gal\u00ad angal Cancer Salve.\" He conducted the Swedish Cancer Sanatorium in Golden, Colo., and also had an office in Denver. Lindgren was not a physician, but placed the mystic letters D.C.M. after his name. He apparently used escharotics.-(From \"Cancer Cures & Treatments:' 1933.) Nevins Sanitarium.-Herbert Nevins conducted an alleged cancer sanitarium in Peoria, 111., and was reported to have admitted that he was a \"cancer specialist\" and a manufacturer. When questioned as to what he manufactured, he replied that he made shoe polish and stove blacking. Nevins. claimed in his advertising that he did not \"use the knife, electricity in any form, or the burning plaster,\" but that his applications to the cancer were made from \"powdered extracts of vegetable remedies.\"-(Condensed from \"Cancer Cttres & Treatments,\" 1933.) Nichols Sanatorium.-The Dr. Nichols Sanatorium for Cancer in Savannah, Mo., was founded by one Perry Lewis Nichols who held a diploma from the University of the South Medical Department, Sewanee, Tenn., 1901. He died in 1925. Perry Nichols got his notion for going into the \"cancer cure\" business when as a young man he was selling real estate in Kingsley, Iowa, a short distance from Cherokee, where an advertising \"cancer cure\" outfit was operating. Nichols is said to have met and later entered into a partnership with the men connected with CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS 15 have been the subject of criticism by Tlie Jounial, the case dragged along for some years, until finally the Association insisted that it either be brought to trial or thrown out of court. It was thrown out I In November 1927 Hoxsey, who for a year had been charged with the responsibility for the death of one of his victims, was finally brought to court,. where he pleaded guilty to the charge of unlawfully treating human ailments and was fined $100 and costs. It was early in 1928 that the Hoxide Institute closed its doors. About the same time Hoxsey was advertising his \"cure\" from another Illinois town-Jacksonville-under the trade name \"National Cancer Remedy Company.\" This attempt to resurrect the Hoxide Institute apparently failed and then Hoxsey advertisements began to come from still another Illinois town, Girard. This outfit, too, in due time seems to have gone the way of the others. The next heard of Hoxsey was in connection with the notorious Norman Baker, whose quackeries in the cancer field have been dealt with in greater detail elsewhere in this chapter. It was the Hoxsey .,treatment\" that was used for cases of \"external\" cancer in the Baker \"Hospital.\" The Hoxsey cure was essentially another one of the old escharotic treatments, with arsenic as the active ingredient. Illinois papers in April 1932 reported Hoxsey's arrest on charges of practicing medicine without a license in violation of the Illinois medical practice act. According to the newspapers, Hoxsey had been found guilty of violating the medical practice act of Illinois in 1929 and was again found guilty and fined for a similar offense in 1930. Following his association with Norman Baker, Hoxsey decided to seek more metropolitan fields and went to Detroit. Here he headed an alleged cancer clinic and, as usual, hired a renegade M\u00b7.D. to help him to evade the medical practice act of that state. Hoxsey was next heard from in 1932 at Wheeling, W. Va., in connection with the Hoxie Cancer Clinic. Soon after opening it, he is said to have been arrested and held under bond. Hoxsey's next move was to Atlantic City, N. J., where, according to information received from the Chamber of Commerce of that city, he interested three laymen, two of them from Philadelphia and one from Wheeling, W. Va., in financing his \"cure\" with the idea of opening another Hoxsey Institute. According to the same source of information, a corporation was formed in New Jersey to take over a hotel at Brigantine Beach, which is but a short aistance from Atlantic City. In due time this bubble burst, as it had burst elsewhere.-(Modified from The Journal A. M.A. of various dates, with additions.) Johnson Remedy Company.-The Dr. Johnson Remedy Company, Kansas City, Mo., was the name under which 0. A. Johnson sold an alleged treatment for cancer. In 1910, the officials enforcing the National Food and Drugs Act declared Johnson's \"Mild Combination Treatment for Cancer'' misbranded. John\u00ad son made no attempt to def end his claims, but put forward the argument that the National Food and Drugs Act as it then existed did not apply to therapeutic claims. This position was upheld by the courts, with the result that the Sherley Amendment was passed, which specifically penalizes false and fraudulent therapeutic claims. About the same time that Johnson was prosecuted under the Food and Drug Act, the postal authorities took up his case of selling a \"cancer cure\" on the mail-order plan. Johnson was cited to show cause why he should not be barred from the use of the mails. Rather than have a fraud order issued against him, Johnson submitted to the government a signed, sworn statement promising that he would \"entirely cease and quit the use of the mails in the home treatment or in the treatment by mail\" of cancer. Two cases of alleged cures of cancer published by Johnson were looked into, and it was found that both women were dead, one having died of cancer of the breast and the other of cancer of the liver. Still other cases of alleged cures of cancer published by Johnson were followed up and the usual results found, namely, that some of the cases were not cancer at all and in others CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS 17 the Cherokee concern and they opened an alleged sanatorium in Des Moines in 1896. They treated one patient-unsuccessfully-and then the partnership was dissolved. In November 1896 Nichols started his own \"cancer cure\" business. Although he had no medical education, he treated patients who had, or thought they had, cancer, keeping within the law by engaging a licensed practitioner to assist him. Later Nichols obtained a medical diploma from a low-grade (class C) institution that went out of existence in 1909. He first began practicing medicine at Watertown, S. D., with cancer-curing as a side-line. Within eighteen months, he moved to Sioux Falls, S. D., and later to Hot Springs in the same state, where he started his first cancer cure \"sanatorium.\" He conducted this for some years, in the meantime attempting to open a branch sanatorium at Excelsior Springs, Mo. But Excelsior Springs would have none of him and passed an ordinance that resulted in Nichols leaving that town. He continued to operate his Hot Springs institution until 1914, when he decided that he would get a little nearer the center of population and went to Savannah, Mo. The Nichols concern used the escharotic treatment. According to the statement that has been made for many years, both before Nichols died and since, the treatment was vaguely described as: \" ... a double compound, about four times the strength of chloride of zinc plaster, or the arsenical or Marsden's paste ... \" After Nichols' death, his institution seems to have been conducted by a woman who had been associated with Nichols for many years and who had been described both as \"Superintendent\" and \"Director of Treat\u00ad ments.\" According to a booklet issued by the Nichols concern in 1931, there were two licensed physicians connected with it. The Nichols concern for years issued elaborate and expensively prepared booklets, printed on deckle-edged paper, with numerous illustrations both in color and black and white. A large part of the book listed, according to states, the names and addresses of \"cured patients.\" A few years ago the Bureau of Investigation of the A. M. A. with the aid of the physicians of a county in Missouri, undertook to investigate all of the cases of patients whose names were given as coming from that county. Fifty-five cases were looked into. Investigation disclosed that forty-seven of the fifty-five patients were still living; eight were evidently actual cancer cases, for the patients were dead. Of the forty-seven patients still living, forty-three had had the diagnosis of cancer made, not by independent physicians, but by the Nichols concern itselfl The other three had their cases diagnosed as cancer by physicians, who had made no microscopic examination, the diagnoses being of a clinical character only.\u00ad ( C ondmsed from ''Cancer Cures & Treatments,\" 1933.) Sal-Tassia.-This was put out by the Sal-Tassia Company of Seattle, Wash., which seems to have been a. trade name used by a woman. Sal-Tassia was described on the company's stationery as \"The Elixir of Life for Cancer,\" but the stuff has also been recommended for goiter, diabetes, anemia, arteriosclerosis, rheumatism, neuritis, tumors and ulcers of the stomach. The Seattle Sfar in June 1929 ran a story on the Sal-Tassia quackery. One of the Sta,; s reporters went with a state inspector and called on the woman who was back of Sal-Tassia. While she was shrewd enough not to attempt a diagnosis, she was very positive that she had the only cure for cancer. The Star article stated that the chief ingredient of Sal-Tassia was baking sodal-(Condeused from \"Cancer Cures and Treatments,\" 1933.) Seaman's Sanitarium.-R. C. Seaman of Cherokee, Iowa, conducted a so\u00ad called sanitarium devoted to the alleged cure of cancer. The institution was known variously as \"Cherokee Sanitarium\" and \"Seaman's Sanitarium.\" R. C. Seaman was born in 1878 and was graduated in 1906 by Bennett College of Eclectic Medicine, Chicago. He had connected with him a Dr. C. 0. Seaman, who was 18 CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS described as \"retired,\" and also one D. A. Seaman as manager. The treatment was the use of escharotics, or, as the advertising matter described it, \"Liquid Escharotic with Combinations.\"-( Abstracted irom The J oiirnal A. A., A1,g. 18, 1923.) Stroopal.-For many years a nostrum known as \"Stroopal\" was sold on both sides of the Atlantic as a cure for cancer. The stuff apparently originated in Germany. According to Gehe's Codex (1913) Stroopal was composed of the powdered leaves of water germander or wood garlic. For seventeen years and probably longer, Stroopal was exploited in a small way from Chicago. At first it seems to have been sold by a crude concern known variously as the \"Institute of Regeneration\" and \"Institute of Reform,\" which operated from various addresses INSTITUTE OP REFORM ST~OOPAL -- -STROOPAL - ~zu. in Chicago. Later Stroopal was advertised under the name of the Stroopal Com\u00ad pany. The postal authorities on Aug. 13, 1930 issued a fraud order against the Stroopal Company and notified the Chicago postmaster to return all letters addressed to the Stroopal Company to the original senders, after having stamped on the letters \"Fraudulent.\"-(Modified from The Journal A. M.A., Oct. 4, 1930.) Tekarkin.-\"Tekarkin\" was the trade-mark name of what was alleged to be a solution of potassium nitrate sold for the cure of cancer. It was put out by the National Bio-Chemical Laboratory of Mount Vernon, N. Y., which, in the past, seemed to have been a trade name used by Dr. Edward Percy Robinson of New York City. This nostrum was extensively advertised in 1931. For some years Robinson seemed to specialize in \"facial contouring,\" a high-hat term for \"beauty specialist.\" In addition to his Tekarkin, Dr. Robinson also had two other nostrums that were to be used in connection with Tekarkin in the treatment of cancer. One of these was called \"Osmo-Calcic Solution\"; the other \"Osmotic Mangano-Potassic Solution.\" With the passage of time, possibly due to the falling off in demand, the Tekarkin treatment was recommended for many other conditions besides that of cancer, such as nephritis, varicose veins, high blood pressure, menorrhagia, arthritis, neuralgia, etc. Following the publication of an article on Tekarkin and Edward Percy Robinson by the Bureau of Investigation of the A. M.A. in 1921, the business seemed to wane, while Dr. Robinson's name appeared more prominently in connection with the beautification of wo\u00b7men than in the treatment of cancer. But early in 1933 the Tekarkin scheme took on a new activity and physicians were circularized by the National Bio-Chemical Laboratory, urging them to use Tekarkin. The product, no longer directly described as a cure for cancer, was recommended \"as an aid in treatment of inoperable cancer or \u00b7 tumor.\" However, there were published in the circulars that were sent out testimonials-alleged to be from physicians-that made it quite unnecessary for the National Bio-Chemical Laboratory to claim that Tekarkin was a cure for cancer. The implication in the testimonials could not be escaped. It was worthy of note, also, that Tekarkin in 1933 was not described merely as a solution of potassium CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS 19 nitrate, but as a \"compound\" solution of potassium nitrate. Just what had been added did not seem to be mentioned in the advertising.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., May 28, 1921, with additions.) Lester Til ton.-This person, originally from Clinton, Iowa, exploited an alleged cure for cancer. It was an escharotic, having a zinc salt as the active ingredient in a base of burnt peat the latter being the mystery element. Tilton had an \"institute\" in Clinton where he treated at different times cancer, tube!r\u00ad culosis and syphilis. His letterheads used to carry the description: \"Tilton Cancer and Blood Poison Treatment.\" In 1923 he was advertising his business as the \"Tilton Laboratories.\" The man had no medical or pharmaceutical training. About 1929 Tilton came to Chicago. He was peculiarly successful in interesting ;, well-meaning but technically untrained persons in supporting his schemes. He played his cards so well that a wealthy individual living near Chicagp became interested in the Tilton \"cure\" and instructed an attorney to draw up a trust deed giving Tilton a huge sum of money for the furtherance of clinical work among persons afflicted with cancer. The attorney, being a man of intelligence, suggested to his client that action be delayed until Tilton's claims could be investigated. He also suggested that the School of Medicine of N orthwestem University might be persuaded to look into the matter and a conference was held between the principal, the attorney and representatives of Northwestern University. As a result, it was agreed that in the interests of the public and to the end that a large sum of money should not be devoted to the furtherance of what would appear to be quackery, an investigation was warranted and justified. A committee was appointed on the faculty of Northwestern University Medical School to interview Tilton anci look into his claims and observe the course and results of Tilton's treatment. After many months the committee issued its report, which at the time summarized its findings by stating that of the twelve patients treated, eight were dead, one was moribund, two still had cancer, both clinically and microscopically, and one was free from cancer-and had been when the Tilton treatment was begun I Finally the state authorities took action against Tilton and on June 16, 1932 he was found guilty of conspiracy to violate the medical practice act of the .State of Illinois and was sentenced to serve from one to five years in the penitentiary and fined $2,000.-(Condensed from The Joiirnal A. M. A. of various dates.) Wilkens' Cancer Specific.-One Peter Wilkens of Muscatine, Iowa (the town from which the Baker cancer-cure concern was operated), for some years put out an alleged cancer cure called \"Wilkens' Proprietary Cancer Specific!' It was sold at $5 for two bottles. It was alleged to be \"made from roots, herbs, flowers and bark.\" Wilkens also had some incidental nostrums, Cures & Treatments,\" 1933.) Williams Sanatorium.-This concern originally in Minneapolis was trans\u00ad ferred to Hudson, Wis. It was conducted by Boyd T. Williams, who was graduated by the Cincinnati College of Medicine and Surgery in 1901, a year before it went out of existence. In 1911 Williams moved to Minneapolis where \u00b7\u00b7he established what he called \"Dr. Williams Sanatorium for Cancer.\" He attempted to get a license to practice medicine in Minnesota, but he was denied the license by the State Board of Medical Examiners. He carried the matter up through the courts to the state supreme court, but without success. In spite of the fact that Williams was given no license to practice in Minnesota, he continued to maintain his cancer sanatorium in Minneapolis. He was repeatedly arrested and fined, but not until the Basic Science law was enacted in Minnesota did it seem possible for that state to protect itself against Williams' illegal practice. Following the passage of 20 CANCER CURES AND TREATMENTS that law, Williams was arrested in February 1928 and fined $100. In March 1930 he was fined $250. In December 1931 he was fined $1,000 with the option of a year in the workhouse. He paid the fine. A short time thereafter Williams' elaborate booklets that he sent out to prospective patients announced that he was moving his sanatorium from Minneapolis to Hudson, Wis. The reason that he gave for this change of location was to get away \"from the never-ending smoke, soot, grime and noise of a large city''--and, one opines, also to get away from a very definite likelihood that he might go to jail if he stayed in Minnesota. In the booklet that Dr. Williams issued, he urged in large and very black type that patients with cancer \"avoid burning and irritating applications.\" Yet it seems that the so-called \"Williams Treatment\" comprised the use of escharotics and the burning out of tissues with the electric cautery.-(Modified from \"Cancer Cures & Treatments,\" May, 1933.J CONSUMPTION CURES AND COUGH REMEDIES The \"consumption cure\" quack uses all the arts of modern advertising to convince the person with tuberculosis that the long-hoped-for specific has been discovered. The consumptive is especially susceptible to quackery. He shares the general belief that for every ailment there is a remedy that will cure, if one only knew where to find it-the age-old idea that every illness can be cured by taking something out of a bottle. Add to this the fact that the reputable physician frankly admits that he knows of no drug that will cure tuberculosis. Then, too, the periods of improvement, that are so common in this disease create an optimism that plays into the hands of quacks. In few organic diseases does the mental element play so important a part as it does in consumption. Any change either in the treatment itself or in the person giving the treatment is likely to result in a temporary feeling of well-being~ It is this curious psychologic fact that makes the tuberculous patient a pitifully easy victim for those who advertise worthless or fraudulent \"consumption cures.\" The speciously worded advertisements, the exaggerated claims, the testimonials-all conspire to convince the consumptive that here at last is the long-hoped-for \"cure.\" Hence the profitableness of this branch of quackery. Of \"consumption cures,\" some have flourished for a few years and have gone out of existence only after their worthlessness was exposed. Some have been investigated by the federal authorities; declared frauds, and debarred from the United States mails. Some still are sold. The fake consumption cure can be abolished only through education. Consumptives, like other people, are gullible not because they lack brains but because they lack special knowledge. The crudely advertised \"consumption cure\" is largely a thing of the past due to the action of the officials who enforce the National Food and Drugs Act. Few newspapers or magazines will longer tolerate advertisements of nostrums sold frankly for the cure of consumption. What has happened, however, is in many instances for the old-line \"consumption cures\" to be advertised not as cures for consumption but as recommended for conditions which even the layman knows are symptom.s of consumption. In this line of \"patent medicines\" as in other lines, the direct falsehood has given place to the falsehood by implication. This chapter gives no details in the methods of exploiting various \"consumption cures\" and cough remedies. Those who want more specific information on the subject will find it in \"Nostrums and Quackery,\" Volume II. All that is attempted here is to give briefly the essential facts regarding a few of the remedies that have been sold for these conditions. At the end of this chapter under \"Briefer Paragraphs\" will be found a list of preparations that have been sold either as consumption cures or, more generally, as cough reme?ies and which have been declared misbranded under the National Food \u00b7and Drugs Act. Practically every case of misbranding was ciue to the fact that the curative claims made for the products were held by the courts to be fraudulent. After each item, in which is given the name of the product and the reported composition as found by the federal chemists, there appears the number of the Notice of Judgment and the year in which that Notice was issued by the federal authorities. 22 CONSUMPTION AND COUGH REMEDIES B. & M. External Remedy.-This nostrum, sold as a remedy for tuberculosis, was put on the market by the National Remedy Company of Boston, later known as F. E. Rollins Company. It was analyzed some years ago by the Department of Health of Massachusetts whose report showed that it was essentially a mixture of oil of turpentine, ammonia and water. In December 1920 the National Remedy Company was found guilty of falsely advertising its product and was fined. In July 1932 after a long and hard-fought case, B. & M. was declared a fraud in the Federal Courts under the National Food and Drugs Act.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Aug. 13, 1932.) Balzone.-This was exploited by a man who became obsessed with the idea that he knew how to treat tuberculosis. He charged $15 for the first treatment and $10 for subsequent treatments. The treatment itself, when analyzed in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory, appeared to be essentially a little colored water into which a few drops of some volatile oil, similar to pine oil, were dropped, and the water brought to a boil. The instructions were for the patient to inhale the steam. -(From the pampl,let \"Consmnption Cures, Cough Medicines, Etc.\", 1931.) Brunson-Holderness Gas Treatment.-There was exploited from El Paso, Texas, what the newspapers described as a \"gas treatment\" for tuberculosis. It was one of the inhalant nostrums and seems to have had a base of mineral oil in which there were small quantities of oils of turpentine, eucalyptus and menthol, with camphor.-(From the pamplilet \"Consumption C1,res, Cough Medicines, Etc.\", 1931.) Fibroform.-This treatment was said to consist in inhaling a fine powder made by mixing soot with chalk phosphate, chloride and lactate. It was exploited in connection with an inhalation device, price $100.-(Co11deused from The Journal A. M.A., May 26, 1923.) Glass Inhalant.-On the basis of an analysis made in 1918, it was reported that the essential ingredients in Glass' Inhal~nt were pine tar, spirits of turpentine, chloroform and traces of a menthol compound.-(From the pamphlet \"Consumption Cures, Cough Medicines, Etc/', 1931.) Pinex.-The claim was made that this preparation contained guaiacol. It was analyzed by the state chemists of Connecticut who, in 1912, reported that they were unable to detect any guaiacol in Pinex, but they did find alcohol, glycerin, tar and sugar. In 1912, too, the state chemists of North Dakota reported that Pinex contained tar, alcohol, chloroform and sugar. The state chemists of Ohio reported in 1914 that Pinex was a \"glycerin solution of tar, chloroform and alcohol.\"-(From the pamphlet \"Consumption Cures, Cough Medicines, Etc.\"1 1931.) Pul-Bro-Tu.-This nostrum originated in Portland, Ore. It was put out by a man who prefixed his name with \"Dr.\" but who was not a physician and had been arrested at various times for violation of the medical practice act. Pul-Bro\u00adTu was essentially a weak solution of potassium iodide and arsenic (Fowler's solution). The \"patent medicine\" would probably never have done any particular damage had not two Oregon physicians-one of whom was a stockholder in the company that put it out and the other had profited through his tie-up with its exploiter-ballyhooed for Pul-Bro-Tu. The Portland City Council appointed a -committee to investigate the \"cure.\" After several hearings, the Committee <leclared unanimously that Pul-Bro-Tu was without value in the treatment of tuberculosis and that its use, as such, constituted a menace.-(Condensed from Tiu Journal A. M.A., March 6, 1926; Dec. 17, 1927; March 31, 1928.) CONSUMPTION AND COUGH REMEDIES 23 Pulvane.-This was exploited from Des Moines, Iowa, and was purported to be an \"advanced method for the treatment of respiratory diseases.\" In the advertis\u00ad ing it was stated that the product was developed in the United States Army Gen\u00ad eral Hospital by officers of the Medical Department. The only information that seemed to be published regarding the composition was that Pulvane contained alphanaphthol and \"three other ingredients.\" The Surgeon-General of the United States declared that the Medical Department of the Army had nothing whatever to do with the matter and that it thoroughly disapproved of the methods used by the promoters.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M. A., March 11, 1922.) Savrite.-The chief advertising asset of this nostrum was the fact that the United States Patent Office had exhibited so little medical and pharmaceutical sense as to grant a patent on the thing. According to the patent specifications, Savrite was made by mixing together 1 gallon of olive oil, 3 pounds of squill root, 1\u00bd pounds of bitter almonds, 1\u00bd pounds of nettle (which one of the five hundred species of nettle was not stated) and 1 pound of red poppy flower petals. The United States Patent Office had dubbed this absurd combination a new and use\u00ad ful invention in the treatment of tuberculosis.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 10, 1923.) Tebex.-This, when analyzed in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M.A., was found to be essentially a petrolatum emulsion containing some creosote.-(Coudensed from The J ounwl A. M. A., June 21, 1930.) Tuberco.-This emanated from Atlanta, Ga., and was sold as \"The Only Guaranteed Treatment For All Forms of Lung Trouble.\" The Tuberculosis Associa tion of Atlanta asked the A. M. A. to analyze this .nostrum because the product was a serious menace to the tuberculous. The chemists reported that Tuberco was essentially gum turpentine coated with powdered cinnamon and placed in capsules and sold at an outrageously high price.-(Comiensed from The Journal A. M. A., March 26, 1927.) Tuberculene.-This \"patent medicine\" was a mixture of creosote, rock candy syrup, glycerin and syrup of wild cherry. In March 1926 the postal authorities declared the thing a fraud and debarred it from the mails.-(Condensed from The J ounial A. M. A., April 3, 1926.) Wright Treatment.-This was sold by the so-called Carrie Wright T. B. Foundation at Corinth, Miss. When analyzed by the chemists of the A. M. A., Mrs. Wright's alleged cure was found to be a mixture of water, glycerin and burnt sugar.-(From the pamphlet \"Consumption Cttrcs, Cough Medicines, 1931.)

The American public alone spends scores of millions of dollars annually on cosmetics. Their manufacture has become one of the mass production industries. Yet, unfortunately, there is no national law which controls the sale of cosmetics. The National Food and Drugs Act of 1906, while offering some protection to the public against adulterated and impure foods and drugs and against false, misleading or fraudulen~ claims made for foods and drugs, by its very wording exempts cosmetics from its purview. The law limits its definition of a \"drug\" to a substance that is used for the alleviation or cure of disease; evidently products which are sold only for alleged beautifying purposes and without medical claims fall outside this law. Yet it is a well known fact that many cosmetics contain drugs and some of them contain drugs that are potentially dangerous. There are three groups of cosmetic preparations that may be objectionable from the health viewpoint: (1) some of the so-called skin bleaches or freckle removers; (2) many of the hair dyes and, (3) certain products sold for the removal of super\u00ad fluous hair. As might be expected, due to the absence of national supervision and any national legal restrictions, there have been marketed in the cosmetic field products that are both falsely advertised and capable of doing damage. Yet, considering the vastness of the business, it is to the credit of the great majority of concerns which make cosmetics that so few of them have taken advantage of the lack of any national law on the subject. Most of the preparations marketed by responsible firms and advertised in the better class magazines are quite free from harmful ingredients. It is equally true, however, that many of these harmless and even meritorious products are ,advertised under claims that are false and misleading if not actually fraudulent. As a matter of convenience, this chapter is divided into four parts ; the first dealing with \"Preparations for the Skin,\" the second with \"Preparations for the Hair,\" the third with \"Depilatories and Deodorants\" and the fourth with Miscel\u00ad laneous material. Preparations for the Skin The great bulk of face powders, face creams, cold creams, compacts, etc. are quite harmless and, if the purchasers will buy only those that are marketed by responsible firms and advertised in the better class magazines, they are likely to run little risk. The preparations sometimes sold as \"skin foods\" or \"flesh foods,\" while usually quite harmless in themselves, are of course not foods for the skin or the flesh. The skin, like every other tissue in the body, can be nourished only by food that is taken into the digestive tract. A similar criticism can be made of the cosmetic preparations which are advertised under the claims that there have been incorporated into them certain vitamins or hormones and that they will rejuvenate the skin-they will do nothing of the sort. The most objectionable preparations to be described in this chapter are those so-called freckle removers or bleaches that depend for their action on the presence of caustic poisons. Most COSMETICS 29 of them contain some poisonous salt of mercury, although other caustics have occasionally been found. They are especially objectionable because the public is given no hint as to their potential harmfulness. The material which follows is taken and condensed from the pamphlet \"Cos\u00ad metics and Allied Preparations,\" prepared by the author in 1935, as one of the many publications of the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Associa\u00ad tion. The number of products dealt with in this chapter are but a few of those dealt with in the pamphlet just mentioned: Ambrosia.-This was analyzed by the state chemists of New Hampshire who in the January 1931 Bulletin reported that it contained, alcohol, glycerin and carbolic acid. Anti-Mole.-An analysis of this preparation made by the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory in 1930 indicated that it consisted of one part glacial acetic acid with three parts nitric acid. The analysis was verified in its essentials by government chemists. \u00b70n. CHARLES\u00b7 FLES\u00b7H F'O.OD THE It has-been used a~d \u00b7 riecom~ded Salve.-The Health in 1935 reported that this con\u00ad tained over 11 per cent of salicylic acid. Clearola.-This was analyzed at various times by different state chemists. They all agreed that Clearola was nothing more mysterious than ordinary sulfur. Charles Plesh Food.-This, when analyzed by the A. M.A. Chemical Labora\u00ad tory in 1915, was found to be mainly starch and petrolatum with a little zinc oxide and soap. JO COSMETICS Contoure Acne Cream.-This was reported by the Maine Bureau of Health in 1935 to contain zinc oxide and carbolic acid. Cutex.-This was sold for the removal of the skin of the nail fold. When analyzed in 1915 by Connecticut state chemists, it was reported to be a solution of caustic alkali in water and glycerin. Deep Pore Cleanser.-The Maine Bureau of Health in 1935 reported that this contained salicylic acid and a small amount of carbolic acid. Epp-o-Tone.-This was sold as a skin food and when analyzed by federal chemists some years ago was found to be essentially epsom salt colored pink. Freckle Removers, Bleachers, Beautifiers, etc.-The following prepara\u00ad tions have been reported in the past to contain some salt of mercury. The ingredient and the date of the report follow the name of each product : Anti-Freckle Lotion ..................... (Corrosive mercury) 1921 Gouraud's Oriental Cream .......... (MercuryCalomel) Special ............. (Ammoniated mercury) 1912 \\ McCorrison's Famous Diamond Lotion No. 1 (Corrosive sublimate) 1914 1915 Freezone.-This was a corn remover and, according to the New York Tributi-e which had it analyzed in 1917, it depended, for its action, upon salicylic acid in collodion. Gloriol Glowene.-This was sold under the claim that soap would destroy the beautiful skin and that Gloriol Glowene should be used in the place of soap. The state chemists of Indiana, Kansas and Michigan all reported that analysis showed Gloriol Glowene to be soft soap. H. M. Cleansing Cream.-This was reported by the Maine Bureau of Health in 1935 to contain salicylic acid. H. M. Ointment.-The Maine Bureau of Health in 1935 reported that this contained carbolic acid and salicylic acid. Liquid Arvon.-The state chemists of Connecticut reported in 1914 that Liquid Arvon \u00b7was an extremely dilute alcohol-glycerin solution contajning salicylic acid, potassium carbonate and possibly resorcin. In 1930 a chemist connected with an educational institution in New York City reported that he had analyzed Liquid COSMETICS 31 Arvon and found it to contain, among other things, arsenic salts. In view of that report, the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory in 1930 tested the product for the presence of arsenic and found that it contained 0.17 per cent of arsenic. In February 1934 the Laboratory again tested a specimen and again found arsenic. A number of cases of dermatitis (inflammation of the skin) and other utoward effects had been reported following the use of Liquid Arvon.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M. A., March 17, 1934.) Lucky Tiger Ointment.-The Maine Bureau of Health in 1935 reported that this contained small amounts of carbolic acid. Marvo Liquid Skin Peel.-Many years ago this preparation apparently had for its active ingredient salicylic acid, but later resorcin was substituted as the active substance. Mayatone.-Analyses of this preparation made some years ago indicated that it was essentially epsom salt colored pink. Van Ess Special Dandruff Massage.-This was analyzed in 1923 by the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory, which reported that it was found to contain kerosene (\"coal oil\"), alcohol, a small amount of quinine sulphate water, per\u00ad fume and coloritfg matter.-(Coude11sed from The Joimial A. M.A., Oct. 27, 1923.) Vita-Ray Vitamin Cream.-Tbis preparation was advertised under the claim that it had been irradiated and that every jar contained 750 A.D.M.A. vitamin D units. It sold at. a dollar a jar. Seven hundred fifty A.D.M.A. vitamin D units is about the amount of vitamin D that one would get from one teaspoonful of cod liver oil I Furthermore, there is not the slightest scientific evidence to prove that such a prodt:ct would have any favorable effect on the skin itself. Preparations for the Hair There are two widely sold and advertised groups of preparations that would come under this heading: (1) the so-called hair tonics and (2) the hair dyes. Most of the \"hair tonics,\" while not dangerous, are wholly without value. A few contain ingredients which may produce a severe inflammation of the skin. The opinion has been expressed by some men who have had a wide experience in the treatment of diseases of the skin and its appendages that one of the causes of baldness may be the promiscuous application of hair tonics. The hair dyes that are sold under proprietary names are most of them potentially harmful. None of them will restore grey hair to its natural color although many are so advertised. What such products do is to dye the hair. Pure vegetable dyes, such as henna and indigo, while harmless, have little commercial significance because of the limited range of shades they will produce. HAIR ToN1cs.-The following is a brief list of preparations that might be classed under the so-called hair tonics : Barker's Hairsutus.-This was said to keep the head free from dandruff. The state chemists of New Hampshire in 1924 reported that analysis showed the preparation to contain over 35 per cent of alcohol with borax and resorcin. Beta Canthol.-The Indiana State Board of Health in 1916 reported that this preparation contained alcohol, resorcin, menthol, beta-naphthol and quinine. Bliss Hair Invigorator.-The New Hampshire state chemists reported in 1925 that this contained over 43 per cent of alcohol with quinine and borax. Danderine.-The state chemists of New Hampshire reported in 1922 that this preparation contained over 80 per cent of alcohol together with salicylic acid and borax. 32 COSMETICS Edonia Quinine Hair Tonic.-The.New Hampshire state chemists reported in 1925 that this preparation contained about 40 per cent of alcohol with quinine and resorcin. Fitch's Tonique Superbe.-The Bureau of Health of the state of Maine reported in 1935 that this contained 1\u00be per cent of salicylic acid. H. M. Eyelash and Eyebrow Grower.-This was reported by the Maine Bureau of Health in 1935 to contain over 6 per cent of salicylic acid. Hair-A-Gain.-This was analyzed in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory which reported that the Hair-A-Gain Paste was apparently a mixture of kerosene and mineral oil with lanolin, soap and tar-like substance. The Hair-A-Gain Liquid Shampoo, according to the same chemists, was essentially a solution of ordinary soap and water. ARE AUTHORlm>TOR\u00a3FUHDTHE PRIC Renewer.-The State Board of Health of New Hampshire reported in 1925 that this contained over 14 per cent of alcohol together with red pepper, borax, sulfur and glycerin. Harper Method Ointment.-This, according to the Maine Bureau of Health in 1935, contained mercury oxide, 1.8 per c~t, and salicylic acid, 5.2 per cent. Herbex Special Pink Hair Cream.-This was reported by the Maine Bureau of Health in 1935 to contain over 8 per cent of salicylic acid. Herbex Standard Yellow Hair Cream.-The Maine Bureau of Health in 1935 reported that this contained over 7 per cent of salicylic acid and about 0.1 per cent of cantharides (Spanish fly). Mahdeen.-Because of several reports of harmful effects foIIowing the use of this preparation, a specimen was examined in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory in 1927. The chemists reported finding arsenic and quinine. K. D. X.-This product, also known as \"Koken's Dandruff Exterminator,\" was reported by the state chemists of Connecticut in 1925 to contain alcohol, arsenic, COSMETICS 33 glycerin and a salicylate. Several cases of severe inflammation of the scalp and face due to the use of this product were reported by the health officer of Harris\u00ad burg, Pa., in 1925. Lucky Tiger.-This ~as analyzed by the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory in 1927 and reported to contain salicylates and a small amount of arsenic. Newbro's Herpicide.-The New Hampshire State Board of Health reported in 1922 that this preparation contained over 28 per cent of alcohol together with salicylic acid and borax. Seven Sutherland Sisters Hair Grower.-The New Hampshire state chemists reported in 1925 that their analysis of this preparation failed to detect any appreciable amounts of substances usually found in hair tonics, with the exception of alcohol of which it contained about 11 per cent. Ultrasol.-This was claimed to contain oil, lemon juice, eggs, sulfur and pituitary gland extract; most emphasis was placed on the last named alleged ingredient. There is not the slightest evidence to show that rubbing pituitary gland extract on a bald head will raise hair. Vreelands Hairerbs.-This was reported in 1930 by federal chemists to be essentially a mixture of glycerin and water (half and half) with a slight trace of saga oil. \u00b7 Westphal's Auxiliator.-The New Hampshire state chemists in 1922 reported that this contained 45 per c_ent of alcohol together with glycerin and borax. Wildroot Hair Tonic.-Dr. Harvey W. Wiley as long ago as 1916 reported that this preparation contained arsenic and some phenolic body, probably resorcin, together with 40 per cent of alcohol. The Connecticut state chemists in 1925 also reported the presence of arsenic in the preparation. Physicians have reported untoward effects following the use of the product. Woodbury's Combination Hair Tonic.-The New Hampshire state chem\u00ad ists reported in 1922 that it contained over 26 per cent of alcohol and resorcin. HAm DYES.-Most of the hair dyes belong to one of two large groups: (1) those depending on aniline derivatives and (2) those containing metallic salts. The aniline-derivative hair dyes give the best results from an resthetic viewpoint pro\u00ad vided they do not poison the person to whom they are applied. Some people are particularly susceptible to dyes of the aniline type and no hair dye of this kind should be used until the person's susceptibility has been tested. Even then the dye should be applied by a skilled hairdresser. The metallic hair dyes all act slowly, while the aniline derivative type produce their effect almost instantaneously. Those of the metallic group which depend for their action on a poisonous lead salt are especially objectionable because their long continued use may produce chronic lead poisoning. Many of these slowly acting hair dyes are sold under the claim that they will restore the natural color of the hair-they will, of course, do nothing of the sort. The hair dyes that depend for their action on a silver salt, while less dangerous than those containing lead, are not altogether free from possible harmful effects. Those hair dyes of the metallic type which contain pyrogallol are also potentially dangerous. Certain metallic salts such as copper or iron are generally used in connection with pyrogallol. Other metallic salts, some\u00ad times used as a basis for hair dyes, are bismuth, cobalt and nickel. The use of any liquid ~air dye on the eyelashes may be fraught with danger and especially those of 34 COSMETICS the aniline derivative type. More than one case of blindness has followed the use of some aniline derivative dyes on the eyelashes. The following hair dyes have been reported on in the past by the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association : Allen's Vita Hair Color Restorer ....... La .............. Phoenix Seminola (silver) (silver) (aniline) (lead) (copper, pyrogallol) (lead) (aniline) (silver) (silver) (silver) (silver) (bismuth) (lead) (aniline) pyrogallol) (lead) (silver) (lead) (aniline) (aniline) (silver) (aniline) (aniline) (lead) (lead) (lead) (lead) (aniline) copper, pyrogallol) (copper, pyrogallol) (lead) (lead) (aniline} (lead) (aniline) (lead) (silver) (silver) (copper, pyrogallol) (aniline) (lead) (copper, iron, pyrogallol) (lead) (lead) (lead) COSMETICS 35 Deodorants, Depilatories, Etc. Superfluous hair may be removed either permanently or temporarily. It may be permanently removed by the use of the X-ray and by the so-called electric needle (electrolysis). There is seldom any excuse for the use of the X-ray because that method is likely to produce such damage to the deeper tissues that permanent disfigurement is almost certain to occur later, with the sequel of cancer always possible. Hair may be removed temporarily by chemicals, or mechanically. The chemical method invariably involves the use of alkaline sulfides which dissolve horn\u00ad like substances such as hair. However, such chemicals may also attack the skin, for the skin has the same general structure as the hair. When used carefully, and with a knowledge of their potency, by persons whose skin is not overse~itive, there may be comparatively little danger in the use of the sulfide depilatories, but they should never be used about the face or eyes. The chemical depi}afories come in various forms-liquid, paste and powders, the last to be mi~ea: with water and made into a paste before being applied. All of them have the c)5jectionable odor of hydrogen sulfide gas. The manufacturers make unsuccessful attempts to cover up this unpleasant odor by powerful perfumes. One other chemical has been used for the removal of superfluous hair, thallium acetate, a most virulent poison. A large number of cases of severe poisoning followed the use of a thallium hair remover (Korembu). The company which put it out was sued for damages and escaped responsibility by going into voluntary bankruptcy, listing about two and one-half million dollars as liabilities and assets of less than three dollars. The mechanical method of removing superfluous hair consists either in clipping the hairs as short as possible with manicure scissors and then rubbing the hair stumps down by some mild abrasive, such as fine pumice stone, or by\u00b7 the use of the so-called wax method. The latter consists in applying in a semi-melted condition wax-like substances which entangle the hair. The wax is allowed to harden and is then given a quick \"yank\" which naturally pulls out the hairs that are thus enmeshed. Most of the deodorants on the market, sold for the purpose of diminishing prespiration in small areas, such as the armpits, have for their essential ingredient a solution of an aluminum salt. They are, broadly speaking, quite harmless although certain persons who are more or less susceptible may occasionally experi\u00ad ence some local irritation. X-RAY wax) Wonderstoen (abrasive) Zip Epilator (wax) 36 COSMETICS Miscellaneous Beauty Clays.-A few years ago one of the fads in the field of cosmetic quackery was the use of so-called complexion clays. Among the most widely advertised were the following: \u00b7Boncilla, Domino Complexion Clay, Mineralava, Ryerson's Forty Minute Beauty Clay, Terra-Derma-Lax. All of these\u00b7 products sold at ridiculously high prices and all of them, when subjected to analysis in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory, were found to consist essentially of clay, water and perfume. The Domino product contained in addition a small amount of glycerin and a still smaller amount of salicylate. These various clays sold for from $2 to $10 a pound. For 10 cents one could purchase from the neighborhood druggist half a pound of kaolin ( dried, powdered clay) and mix it with the same weight of water. This would produce a pound of clay equal in beautifying power to, and purer than, any of the products just mentioned. Scholder Institute.-There flourished a few years ago the Professor Scholder Institute, Inc. It was said to be conducted by one \"Professor Maurice Scholder.\" The \"professor\" admitted that he was an \"internationally renowned specialist on ailments of hair and scalp.\" He advertised that he had a \"course of home treat\u00adment\" that was \"based on the principle of individual analysis, diagnosis and perscription.\" In other words, he claimed to analyze and treat each case indi\u00ad vidually. He obtained his clientele through the advertising pages of such publica\u00ad tions as Physical Cultt,rc and Strength, and also by means of the radio. In his advertisements, he urged the bald to write to him and enclose a few specimens of hair (if any) so that he might by microscopic examination diagnose the condition. Scholder's story was that many years previously he had obtained from a learned Dominican friar in Galicia a scientific secret that was the basis of his discovery for growing hair on bald heads. In order to test the professor's abilities, the author of this book sent to the professor some hair specimens plucked from the fur cuff of a woman's coat. The fur was what is known in the trade as platinum fox. Some days later a letter was received from the professor in which he stated : \"I have analyzed the specimens of hair you sent to me, A microscopic examination discloses that the roots are in a seriously undernourished condition. You are in grave danger of continuous and increasing loss of hair, but it can still be saved by prompt treatment. \"I am therefore willing to undertake your case. I\u00a3 you wish to enroll for my treatment, it is necessary that you fill out the enclosed Diagnosis Chart very carefully, in order that I may ascertain what remedies will be most effective for your treatment. I will then prescribe for you and send you the proper remedies, which, I assure you, will positively restore your hair and scalp to normal, healthy condition, stop further falling out of your hair, and, if you follow my instructions faithfully, enable you to grow strong, new hair, to replace that which you have already lost.\" It appeared therefore that these hairs of platinum fox from the cuff of a coat had roots that were in a seriously undernourished condition. Another letter was sent to the professor (from a different address and under a different nom de plume) and accompanying it were hairs taken from a fur collar (known to the trade as wolf, but really Siberian or Japanese dog). Back came a letter from the professor identical with that sent in answer to the first letter. The roots of the hairs of this Japanese dog also were in a seriously undernourished condition I Realizing that it was possible that these specimens of fur might have been in a seriously under\u00ad nourished condition, the author enlisted the aid of a young woman who had an exceptional head of hair. It hung down below the waist and in the days of bobbed hair was so luxuriant as to excite notice and admiration. The young woman donated three perfectly healthy hairs to the cause of science. Each hair measured COSMETICS 37 more than three feet in length. Two inches was carefully cut off the \"root\" end of the hair and thrown away and the remainder of the long hairs cut into short lengths and sent to the professor from a different address and with a different nom de plume with a request for analysis. The professor without effort swallowed the bait, hook, line and sinker I Back came his letter reading word for word with the other two-\"microscopic examination\" had again disclosed that \"the roots were in a seriously undernourished condition.\" It seemed evident that so far the test had proved conclusively that this \"inter\u00ad national specialist\" was unable to differentiate between normal healthy human hair and the fur of a platinum fox or a Siberian dog. It seemed desirable therefore to learn whether the professor really knew a human hair when he saw it. So a piece of heavy wrapping twine, two inches in length, was carefully unraveled so that the individual filaments, glanced at superficially, had the gross appearance of hair. However, it was of such a color as gentlemen are said to prefer and for that reason half of the filaments were dyed with a silver-salt dye and the other half were treated with a lead and sulfur dye. In the first case, a dead black resulted and in the second a brownish tone. The black twine filaments were sent to the professor from one address and the brown twine filaments were sent from another. In due course, back came the letter stating that a microscopic examination disclosed that the roots were in a seriously undernourished condition. If even the office boy had been delegated the task of examining the specimens that \"suckers\" sent in, he would have recognized immediately that when the twine filaments were put under the microscope he was being spoofed. The Scholder advertisements stated that the newspapers of the country had proclaimed Scholder as \"the marvel of his profession.\" They were conservative ! Any man who on the basis of a microscopic examination of pieces of dyed twine could diagnose the hair health of persons he had never seen and then promise to \"positively restore\" the hair and scalp to normal might rightly be called a marvel. -(Condensed from Hygeia, October 1927.) DEAFNESS CURES AND TREATMENTS Many of the quacks or faddists who defraud or deceive the deafened have been crude charlatans; a few have possibly been in that \"twilight zone\" of medical practice where it is difficult to differentiate between the quack with a scheme and the visionary with a theory. Some quacks have carried their alleged deafness cures merely as sidelines to other medical fakes. Some have sold elaborate but worthless courses of treatment ; others have sold devices that were not only value\u00ad less but dangerous. Still others, physicians of mediocre ability, were itinerants who were usually not more than twenty-four hours in one place. While this chapter deals very briefly with devices and systems that were either of dubious merit or were dangerous, there are on the market a number of meritorious aids to hearing. Most of these are electrical in type and are con\u00ad structed on the principle of a small portable telephone with a microphone attach\u00ad ment. It is unfortunate that some of these electrical aids, valuable in themselves, have been sold under exaggerated claims. Some types of deafness cannot be helped by such aids to hearing, and no deafened person should expect to be restored to normal by the use of hearing aids. Furthermore, these aids to hearing are not, and should not be considered as, devices for treatment. The material in this chapter has been condensed from articles prepared by the author for The Jounial A. M.A., for Hygeia and for the pamphlet \"Deafness Cures and Treatments\" issued by the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association. Dr. W. 0. Coffee.-This man used to conduct a mail-order deafness cure from Davenport, Iowa. See article on the subject in the chapter on Mail-Order Concerns. Hearwell Oil.-This \"deafness cure\" nostrum of fairly wide distribution was put out by a Milwaukee concern. With the oil there also came some tablets to be used as a supplementary treatment. When subjected to preliminary tests in the American Medical Association's Chemical Laboratory, it was reported that apparently Hearwell Oil was crude Japanese camphor oil, a by-product in the manufacture of camphor; the tablets were sodium iodide in an excipient of elm bark. \u00b7 Leonard's Ear Oil.-This was one of the most widely advertised deafness cures of the medicinal type. Some years ago the department of health of the city of New York analyzed Leonard's Ear Oil and reported that it was, in effect, an emulsion of mineral oil and soft soap with a little camphor and eucalyptol. Leonard was arrested and found guilty of making false and misleading claims. He was sentenced to pay a fine of $250 or go to jail. Later, the federal authorities seized a quantity of the Leonard's Ear Oil, charging that the claim that the stuff was an effective remedy for the cure of deafness was fraudulent since the prepara\u00ad tion contained no ingredient or combination of ingredients capable of producing the effects claimed. The court ordered that the product be destroyed. Mega-Ear-Phone.-This came from Philadelphia and was sonorously described were told, the \"latest and most effective device DEAFNESS REMEDIES 39 for the relief of impaired hearing of any degree.\" The Mega-Ear-Phone outfit consisted of six pairs of Mega-Ear-Phones, made of oiled silk, a small hard rubber tube, split at one end, to be used in inserting the device, a small bottle of oil, a rubber ear syringe, a few wooden applicators, a small wad of cotton and a pair of tweezers. The outfit sold for $10. As a cure for deafness, it was not worth 10 cents. Aurine Ear Balsam.-A few drops of Aurine Ear Balsam, it was claimed would cause deafness of catarrhal origin to disappear. With discharging ears the daily use of Aurine Ear Balsam was said to stop the discharge. If one believed the advertising, the deafness of old age could also be remedied by Aurine Ear Balsam. According to the Aurine school of otology, head noises are caused by mucus that holds the small bones of the ear in one place; Aurine was said to loosen the mucus and the head noises stopped. The deafened were told that thickened, relaxed or sunken drums are due to the eustachian tubes becoming stuffed with mucus, and that a few drops of the \"balsam\" would soon restore the drums to their natural condition. Prospective victims were urged to send in $2 for a package. Those who bit got an ounce of oil-the \"balsam\" -an elongated tooth pick with a pledget of cotton on one end, a medicine dropper and a small wad of absorbent cotton. They were told to instil three or four drops of Aurine Ear Balsam into each affected ear once a day and to clean the external opening every other morning with the wooden swab. The victim of discharging ears was told to mix five drops of Aurine Ear Balsam with four tablespoonfuls of warm water and inject it into the ear with the glass dropper every other day. \"Stick to Aurine Ear Balsam and get rid of your trouble.\" A preliminary examination of Aurine Ear Balsam was made in the Chemical Laboratory of the American Medical Association and the chemists reported that the product appeared to consist largely of glycerin with boric acid, aromatic oils and what apparently was a local anesthetic. The name of Aurine was later changed to \"Ourine.\" 40 DEAFNESS REMEDIES C.H. Muncie.-This man, an osteopath, claimed to cure deafness by means of what he called \"operative constructive finger surgery.\" According to the Muncie advertising booklet, he obtained the following results from his methods of treating deafness : In the prevention of deafness, he claimed 100 per cent success. In what he called first degree catarrhal deafness, he claimed to produce permanent improve\u00ad ment in 100 per cent of cases and cures in 95 per cent. In second degree catarrhal deafness, he stated that he produced permanent improvement in 95 per cent and cures in 80 per cent. In cases of deafness in which there were adhesions ~d inflammatory exudates in the middle ear with involvement of the ossicles, he claimed he got improvement in 75 per cent. The same booklet described his technic. With the patient under nitrous oxide (gas) anesthesia he \"normalized and reconstructed\" pus-pockets and adhesions and removed them.\" Then the patient would come back \"from a pleasant sleep with a recon\u00ad structed nasal and nasopbaryngeal area.\" Radium Ear or Audiphone.-This was a metal device, having a straight cylinder to fit the ear canal and curved portion that hugged the outer ear. Its chief element of hokum lay not in its mechanical structure but in the claim that the device was radioactive. Originally, it was said to be charged with \"Hearium,\" .an alleged radioactive substance. It was put out by an individual who dealt in take radium I Later, Hearium was abandoned as an ingredient of the Radium Ear and what was said to be an actual deposit of radium in extremely low dosage was substituted I This low dosage \"radium\" was furnished by an advertising quack on the Pacific coast. The Radium Ear had no more value as a cure for deafness than the luminous figures on the dial of a dollar watch. DEAFNESS REMEDIES 41 Vibraphone.-This was an alleged improvement on the \"Radium Ear\" and the \"Audiphone.\" It was alleged to have been \"improved\" by the addition of a \"vibrator\" and was then lmown as the Vibraphone I The Vibraphones were sold at $15 a pair. There was a so-called refund arrangement whereby the purchaser might, after trying out the device, return it to the company with the statement that it was of no benefit and the company would return one-half the purchase price. This meant that the concern got $7.50 together with the return of the device. Virex.-This was a widely advertised mail-order fake. It is dealt with briefly in the chapter on Mail-Order Concerns. DIABETES CURES AND TREATMENTS Faddists, quack and \"patent medicine\" venders find their most fertile field in exploiting sufferers of those diseases which run a prolonged course and which, at least in the earlier stages, do not cause acute suffering. Even the most vocal alleged disbeliever in scientific medicine usually hurries to the physician's office as soon as he has any ailment that produces pain. In those serious conditions in which pain, at least at the outset, is not a symptom and which call for prolonged treatment with probably a complete change in the hygienic and dietetic habits of the patient, the medical heretic is likely to succumb to the blandishments so plausibly presented by faddists, quacks and nostrum exploiters. This explains the great number and wide distribution of alleged cures and treatments for cancer, tuberculosis, kidney disease and diabetes. The number of so-called remedies and treatments for diabetes is increasing in proportion to the admitted increase in the number of known cases of diabetes. The victim of diabetes, unless of more than average intelligence, is likely to rebel at the only treatment that holds out any hope of prolonging his life: careful dieting, strict attention to hygiene and, in the more serious cases, the use of insulin. Many are stilt obsessed with the age-old idea that for every ailment there is a specific cure in the form of a medicine, if one only knew what medicine. Those who treat diabetic patients know how difficult it is to get them to obey the physician's orders as to diet and how prone they are to experiment with the thousand-and-one \"cures\" recommended to them, either by well meaning friends or by those who trade in \"cures.\" The diabetic field is a rich one for those who would commercialize human suffering, and it is one that is assiduously tilled. The cruder \"patent medicines\" for diabetes are quite frequently recommended indiscriminately for both diabetes and kidney disease. Yet diabetes is not a disease of the kidneys, although one of the symptoms, that of greatly increased amount of kidney secretion, is likely to direct the patient's attention to the kidneys. Diabetes is a disease of metabolism; that is, a disease of certain of the body processes. The sugar that appears in the urine of the diabetic patient is a symptom ; it is not the disease. In fact, it is quite possible for a patient who is not diabetic to have sugar appear in the urine. It has been estimated that about one out of every six patients who consult physicians because they have sugar in the urine is non\u00ad diabetic. The presence of sugar in the kidney secretion of those who are not diabetic is of especial interest in the discussion of freak or fraudulent treatments for diabetes, because it is such cases of transient glycosuria that produce the occasional report of what is called a \"cure\" following the use of some widely vaunted remedy. What happens in such cases is that, with the dietetic restric\u00ad tions which the exploiters of nearly all alleged cures for diabetes require their victims to follow when taking their nostrums, the amount of food taken, especialJy the carbohydrates, is reduced to the point where the patient can properly metabolize or utilize the sugar produced. Such cases of what has been called alimentary glycosuria may be due either to taking more carbohydrate than the patient can normally handle or to some emotional stress, or to both conditions. An investigation of practically all the widely advertised \"cures\" or \"treatments\" for diabetes has demonstrated that probably 95 per cent of them comprise products which, when taken internally, act to increase the flow of kidney secretion ; that is, _,.,; /,r\u00b7 or It had failed T.bo book haA U pages NOTO?' wu o title more fttttng tol uy nbJcct them the Utle or DIABETES There CDICAGO. 11.1. DIABETES ITS CAUSF.5 AND CURE BY A GERMAN SPECIALIST A New DIABETES Tbcr:apy 11m has already prowcd lt!Clf. after IIIIIDJ' PrxtkatTcsts. to the trc:llmCDI of DIABETES Clkllilml Expurgo Anti-Diabetes lo die New Cure pcrfcclly ~ A c,,., 44 DIABETES REMEDIES they are diuretics. In a similarly large proportion the exploiters require the patient to diet strictly but not scientifically. These two points should be borne in mind. They are important not only to the diabetic but to the person who is not diabetic but has been led to believe he is. The average diabetic patient learns to estimate roughly the amount of sugar he is excreting. This is done by means of color tests which indicate the proportion of sugar in the specimen examined. The patient is likely, however, to fail to measure the total amount of urine passed in the full twenty-four hours or to make his test with a portion of the entire twenty-four hour specimen ; instead, he probably tests a single specimen. If such a patient takes one of the numerous diuretic nostrums sold for diabetes he will naturally excrete a much larger amount of urine than he has been passing. Obviously, then, when he tests a single specimen after taking such a preparation, he finds that the proportion of sugar in that specimen is considerably less. For instance, suppose a diabetic patient excretes 4 ounces of sugar daily with a twenty-four hour excretion of 3 quarts of urine. He then takes an alleged cure which so stimulates the kidneys that he doubles the amount of urine passed; that is, he passes 6 quarts of urine daily. It is evident that any given specimen tested will show only half the amount of sugar previously found. The diabetic patient should be reminded that the taking of a kidney irritant in the form of \"patent medicines\" not only is not helping his diabetes but is still further damaging kidneys that are already overburdened by the task thrown on them in excreting sugar, thus leading to the possibility that a form of Bright's disease may be added to the diabetes already present. In the present state of medical knowledge there is no substance known that will cure diabetes. There is known, however, a substance, insulin, which,. when administered scientifically, will prolong the patient's life so that he may live out his allotted span and, what is of almost equal importance, will permit him to eat, within reason, most of the foods that healthy persons can eat. There is also evidence that in certain cases of diabetes the use of insulin seems to help the pancreas regenerate some of its normal insulin-producing powers. As J ostin has said, \"A considerable number of patients begin insulin and their disease improves so much that later they are able to omit it.\" In the paragraphs that follow there will be given as briefly as possible information about alleged treatments for diabetes, all of which are worthless as cures for the disease. Some of them have been declared fraudulent in the courts. The material in this chapter has been condensed from an article by the author that was published in Hygeia, October 1935. Alberty's Anti-Diabetic Vegetable Compound.-Reported by the federal chemists to be essentially powdered vegetable matter.-(N. J. 21220; 1934.) Amber-ita.-This was marketed by a man who was in the real estate business and sold eyeglasses but had no knowledge of the action of drugs. In June 1934 the Federal Trade Commission ordered him to cease alleging that his product would cure or aid in the cure of diabetes or would remove or relieve its symptoms. Banbar.-This \"patent medicine\" was sold by an ex-shirt salesman. The gov\u00ad ernment chemists analyzed Banbar and found that it, like so many other nostrums for diabetes, was essentially a diuretic; that is, a kidney stimulant. It was a water-and-alcohol extract of the weed \"horsetail,\" flavored with peppermint and containing small amounts of epsom salt, potassium acetate, bearberry, May-apple, strychnine and leptandra. The advertising of Banbar led the patient to believe that by using this mixture he could discontinue insulin and, for all practical pur- l , DIABETES REMEDIES 45 poses, eat anything that he wanted. It never cured a case of diabetes, but the government officials who investigated it found any number of diabetic sufferers, who had relied on it and written testimonials for it, dead 1 Bauer's Antidiabeticum.-This was put out by a German concern. It was another diuretic. Investigations conducted in various scientific institutions in Europe proved that Antidiabeticum was valueless, and whatever good results followed the use of the preparation were due to the dietetic restrictions that went with the nostrum. Beto.-This was advertised as \"A Blessing to Diabetics. Very Latest Dis\u00ad covery. Absolutely No Dieting.\" The stuff came in the form of large white tablets, each one having an average weight of about one-fourth ounce. The tablets smelled strongly of cinnamon. When they were analyzed in the chemical laboratory of the A. M. A., they were found to consist of epsom salt 1 In other words, patients were sold less than 25 cents' worth of epsom salt under a fancy name and were charged $5 for it. They bought it in the belief that the stuff would cure diabetes and that it would be unnecessary to diet. The Carr Fraud.-A Chicago woman sold this on the mail-order plan. She was not a physician, a pharmacist or a chemist, and she did not employ any one having these qualifications. She claimed in her advertising that she was importing certain herbs that had been used by the \"monks of old\"; as a matter of fact, she bought her herbs from a concern in Hammond, Ind. Her \"diabetes cure\" consisted of a mixture of sassafras bark, marshmallow root, couch grass, juniper berries and round dock; in other words, it was another diuretic. The thing was declared a fraud by the postal authorities in May, 1932. Cerevisine Tablets.-Reported to be essentially dried yeast.-(N. J. 18475,\u00b7 1932.) Diabesan.-This preparation was marketed by a New Jersey concern and the chief evidence for its alleged value was based on the published statements of the president of the company that put it out. This man had been connected with other nostrum concerns as well as with a crude \"diploma mill.\" Some years prior to the Diabesan exploitation, he was advertising a \"consumption cure\" and was convicted and fined for practicing medicine without a license. Needless to say, Diabesan never cured a case of diabetes. Diabeticine.-This \"patent medicine\" was sold on the mail-order plan. It was claimed that Diabeticine would \"purge the blood of its excess sugar,\" that it would \"drive the excess sugar from the blood stream,\" that it would \"arrest the progress\" of diabetes and that it would \"avoid future necessity of injecting insulin.\" The postal authorities investigated this product and the government chemists reported that Diabeticine consisted essentially of chopped-up wild carrot, popularly known as Queen Anne's Lace. The government also tested it in the Pharmacological Laboratories and found that it did not have the slightest effect in curing diabetes. One of the most glowing testimonials published for Diabeticine was that of the man who, although the public had no means of knowing it, was the chief exploiter of the nostrum. The govenment investigators found that this man was at that time suffering from diabetes. The sale of Diabeticine was declared a fraud and in June 1935 a fraud order was issued debarring it from the United States mails. Diabetylin.-Reported to consist essentially of yeast and sodium phosphate.\u00ad ( N. J. 13962; 1926.) 46 DIABETES REMEDIES Diano.-Reported to be essentially chloride of lime (approximately 1 per cent), a trace of chlorine, glycerin (approximately 16 per cent) and about 83 per cent of water.-(N. J. 20555; 1934.) Flowering Herb.-The main ingredient of this was the buckbean and mixed with it were small amounts of horsetail In March 1931 the United States mails were closed to it through the issuance of a fraud order.

Dept.109 K Thi1 ii. 11 Juplit11t1 ' lnsoloid (lnsurol).-This was said to combine \"insulin with the actual substance of the pancreas gland.\" Under the name Insurol federal chemists reported that it contained yeast, glandular tissue, lecithin and lithium salicylate.\u00ad ( N. J. 18212,\u00b7 1931.) Kaadt Treatment.-This product, according to the exploiter, changed \"the starches and sugars in the intestines\" so that the patient would get \"normal sugar instead of diabetic sugar.\" While this sounded imposing to those who knew nothing about the pathology of diabetes, it was quite meaningless. Some tests made on a specimen of the Kaadt Treatment in 1931 showed that the product was a brown, murky liquid having an odor similar to that of vinegar, in which had been dissolved potassium nitrate, an active diuretic. --------~----- \u00b7-\u00b7-------------- DIABETES REMEDIES 47 Eksip.-This was advertised under the claim that it would be unnecessary for persons with diabetes to diet if they would take this \"patent medicine.\" The chemists of the A. M. A. analyzed Eksip in 1922 and showed that it consisted chiefly of magnesium carbonate and starch. In February 1931 the United States postal authorities declared the thing a fraud and debarred it from the United States mails. When the postal authorities began to investigate Eksip, they looked into the case of a Mr, Meyers of Charleston, S. C., whose testimonial claimed him to be \"a living advertisement of Eksip.\" They found that Mr. Meyers had been dead five years ; cause of death, diabetes. When the case was before the postal authorities, the exploiter presented a Mr. Smith, a diabetic patient who testified that since taking Eksip he had been greatly benefited and he \"didn't bother about diet any more.\" Three days after he had testified and before the Eksip hearing was completed, Mr. Smith died in diabetic coma 1 Certain newspapers and magazines got $20,000 a year for advertising this swindle; the concern took in over $91,000 a year I Kelpe'koe.-This is a later name for a product sold earlier as \"Pacific Health Ore.\" It was recommended particularly for diabetes and also for a long list of other ailments such as ulcers of the stomach, goiter, female disorders and piles. The stuff was crushed rock. The directions were to pour water over the rock and drink the solution, which was essentially alum and iron sulfate. Lee's Lithontriptic.-Reported to be a plastic mass nearly one half soap with some potassium nitrate, potassium bicarbonate, juniper oil and a small quantity of an iron compound and water.-(N. J., 18181; 1931). [The name of this was later changed to \"Lee's Littentreptic.\"] Pancretone.-This was advertised as \"the nearest specific that has yet been found\" in the treatment of diabetes. While the advertisements advised the patient that if he bought Pancretone it would be unnecessary to go on a rigid diet, never\u00ad theless the victim found after purchasing the drug that he must \"not use potatoes, white bread, sugar, candy, pie and cake, macaroni, rice, spaghetti and beans, dates, figs, bananas, preserves and jellies\" -as well as other things. When Pancretone Tablets were analyzed in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., they were found to be essentially digestive tablets to which had been added considerable cornstarch and chalk. Photo-Synthetic Tea.-Reported to be a ground-up weed, 1933.) Sanborn Treatment.-This piece of mail-order quackery originated with a Dr. Sanborn of Chicago from which city it was first exploited by a Chicago laywer, one Charles S. Harmon, a diabetic patient who claimed that he had been cured by it. Mr. Harmon died of diabetes. Later Dr. Sanborn died and the \"cure\" seems to have been bought out by one Walter T. Bobo of Battle Creek, Mich., who had operated quack medical mail-order concerns for years. In 1934 when the government officials were closing in on Bobo because of his quackeries, he com\u00ad mitted suicide. The Sanborn Treatment was responsible for some untimely deaths of sufferers from diabetes. Santay-Swiss Anti-Diabetic Tea.-Reported to contain plant drugs includ\u00ad ing peppermint leaves and stems, malva flowers, senna pods and dog grass.\u00ad (N. J. 22199; 1934.) Sal-Sano.-Reported to contain about 40 per cent baking soda, 20 per cent Glauber's salt (\"horse salts\"), 20 per cent common salt and 13 per cent sodium phosphate.-(N. J. 6658; 1920.) \u00b7 48 DIABETES REMEDIES Uvursin (Fulton's Compound).-Under the earlier name, the preparation was declared by the federal authorities to be worthless as a cure for diabetes and the courts held that the claim that it would cure diabetes was fraudulent. A long and detailed article on Fulton's Compound was published in Volume II of \"Nostrums and Quackery.\" Case after case was cited of individuals who had given testimonials for the Fulton nostrum, claiming that they had been cured of diabetes, and evidence was presented in the form of the reproduction of death certificates showing that the persons had in fact died of diabetes. Vindor Diabetic Wine.-Reported to contain plant drug extracts including cinchona, with a phosphorus compound, alcohol and water.-(N. J. 17210; 1931.) Warner's Safe Diabetes Remedy.-Reported to consist of extracts of plant drugs, methyl salicylate (wintergreen), a trace of alkaloids, glycerin and water.\u00ad (N. J. 20901; 1934). In addition to the preparations already described, there have been sold as remedies for diabetes the following products that are equally worthless as cures for EPILEPSY CURES AND TREATMENTS The cause of epilepsy is still unknown. In certain cases 'the \"fits\" are due to injuries of the skull, of the brain or of the membranes that cover the brain-the meninges. Such cases can sometimes be relieved by an operation. Another type of epilepsy appears to be definitely associated with a poisoning of the system-an intoxication. Some have held that true epilepsy is a disease of the mind. One thing seems certain : Epilepsy is not a clear cut condition but includes a certain group of symptoms that differ widely as to their origin or causes. Few conditions known in medicine call for greater individuality in treatment than does epilepsy. Even under the most skilled treatment, the results may be disappointing. There\u00ad fore sufferers from epilepsy fall easy victims to the wiles of the faddist or the quack, who, without knowledge or conscience, leads the sufferer to believe that in his secret combination of drugs he has discovered the long-sought remedy for the condition. \u00b7 For many years the drugs mainly relied on by physicians-not to cure but to control the seizures of epilepsy-were the bromides. The bromides must be used with caution. While they will reduce the frequency of the attacks, the bromides will not cure epilepsy and the long-continued and continuous use of bromides may bring about physical and mental deterioration. Within the last few years, a newer drug has been used in the treatment of epileptic seizures, phenobarbital, introduced under the proprietary name \"Luminal.\" For some time after it was introduced, luminal was supposed to be free from practically all the ill effects that followed the continued use of the bromides. More extended experience proved, however, what has been proved so many times, that any drug that is powerful enough to be of value is also powerful enough to be dangerous. Now there are reports in medical literature of the harmful effects of the continued use or overdosage of luminal. There are many quack remedies sold under the claim, either direct or implied, that they will cure epilepsy. None of them will do anything of the sort. Until the introduction of luminal, practically all of the \"epilepsy cures\" on the market con\u00ad sisted essentially of bromides. As the use of luminal for controlling attacks became more common among the medical profession, the epilepsy cure quacks began to adopt this drug for their uses. Practically every alleged epilepsy cure, sold either through the drug stores or on the mail-order plan, has for its essential drug either bromides or luminal. In some instances the quacks use both, putting out a bromide mixture under one name and luminal mixture under another, and using different company names for their exploitation. Acoma.-This was sold as an alleged specific for epilepsy. To get what mail\u00ad order quacks call a \"sucker list,\" the postmasters of small towns were circularized and asked to send in the names of people in their vicinity who had epilepsy. The postmaster was offered 25 cents for every order placed by those in his list. The Acoma tablets, when examined in the chemical laboratory of the A. M. A., were found to contain phenobarbital (luminal).-(From the pamphlet \"Epilepsy 'Cures' and 'Treatments'\", 1931.) ARC.-The medical profession was widely circularized by the concern which had for sale the ARC Epilepsy Remedy. Free samples were offered. The product itself was a grayish powder that came in capsules. The Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. analyzed ARC and reported that the contents of \u00b7the capsules so EPILEPSY REMEDIES averaged about 21/s grains, of which about 1\u00bd grains was phenobarbital (luminal), together with some laxative and a small amount of dye.-(Condensecl from The J 01,rnal A. M. A., Oct. 1, 1927.) Converse Treatment.-This was sold on the mail-order plan. One H. E. Sanderson seemed to have been the head of the concern. The names of sufferers from epilepsy were obtained by writing to the mayors, presidents of city councils, or justices of the peace of small towns offering a small dictionary for the names of four epileptics, a fountain pen for three names, a cook book for two names, and a song book for one name. When the Converse \"treatment\" was analyzed in the Chemical Laboratory of the A M. A. some years ago, it was found to be a bromide mixture. The company not only kept this fact from the public but led the victim to infer that the stuff contained no bromides by stating that bromides \"tend to aggravate the trouble in the long run.\"-(Conde,isecl fro,n The Journal A. M.A., April 24, 1915; Dec. 2, 1922.) Dexo.-See \"H~ter's Epilepsy Cure.\" Epilepson.-In part of its advertising, the exploiters of this nostrum quoted freely from exposes published by the A. M. A of other quack epilepsy remedies. The theme played up by the \"Epilepson\" concern was to the effect that the bromide treatment of epilepsy was harmful and that bromides did more damage than good. When Epilepson was examined in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., it was found to be another of the phenobarbital (luminal) mixtures.-(Con\u00ad de11sed from The Journal A. M.A., April 7, 1928.) Hale's Epileptic Relief.-This was advertised under the claim that it \"cures fits and epilepsy.\" There was the usual offer of a free sample. Those who answered the advertisements received a four-ounce bottle of brown liquid, together with a small package of tablets. When analyzed, the brown-colored fluid, which was supposed to constitute the Epileptic Relief, was found by the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. to be a bromide mixture, each teaspoonful containing the equivalent of 13 grains of potassium bromide. The tablets were found to be laxative.-(Co11de1ised from The Journal A. M. A., March 4, 1922.) Hunter's Epilepsy Cure.-This was exploited from Little Rock, Ark. The Hunter \"remedy\" came in the form of a white powder in colored capsules. When analyzed in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., the stuff was found to be about one-fourth phenobarbital (luminal) and three-fourths milk sugar I Later, the same outfit put out another alleged remedy for epilepsy under the name, \"Dexo.0 This, when analyzed by the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., was found to be a bromide mixture.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M.A., J11ne 19, 1926.) Maghee's Epilepsy Treatment.-This product, from Lander, Wyo., was sold by mail as an alleged remedy for epilepsy. The Maghee advertising matter declared that the treatment would give \"immediate and continuous relief of epilepsy\" and that those who took it would \"return to a normal condition in every respect.\" When analyzed by the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., the Maghee nostrum was found to be a mixture of about 64 per cent phenobarbital (luminal), 32 per cent charcoal and nearly 3 per cent bismuth.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M.A., Sept. 24, 1921.) N obro.-This was sold from Worthington, Ohio on the mail-order plan and by methods common to mail-order quackery. When analyzed in the Chemical Laboratory of the A M.

It was a phenobarbital (luminal) preparation.-(Condenscd from The Journal A. M.A., Feb. 20, 1932.) Nurosol.-This was put out by the same persons who exploited Nurone. It too was a phenobarbital preparation.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Feb. 20, 1932.) Phenoleptol.-This came from the same address (but under another company name) as that from which N urone was sold and it was exploited by the same quacks. It was another phenobarbital product.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 20, 1932.) Renesol.-This was a later name for the product sold by the two New York quacks under the name N urosol and was put out from the same address. It was a phenobarbital mixture.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Feb. 20, 1932.) R. P. N.

When ~nalyzed, it was found that the tablets comprising the \"treatment\" were a mixture of bromides.-(Con\u00ad densed from The Journal A. M.A., May 26, 1928.) Vitosol.-This also was put out by the same persons who exploited Nurone, N urosol, Phenoleptol and Renesol, all of them phenobarbital preparations sold under false claims. Vitosol, like the rest of them, was a phenobarbital preparation. -(Co,zdensed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 20, 1932.) Warn's Epilepsy Treatment.-The claims made in the advertising by the Warn concern were strikingly similar to the claims made by the exploiter of \"Maghee's Epilepsy Treatment.\" It also sold for the same price as the Maghee \"remedy\"--$5. When analyzed in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., it was found to contain 72 per cent of phenobarbital (luminal) and 28 per cent of charcoal.-(Condmsed from The Joi1,rnal A: M.

Part of its advertising was the reproduction in facsimile of a letter from a physician of Chicago, puffing the treatment. Investigation showed that the doctor was one of the owners of the outfit. When the Western Medical Association's \"treatment'' was analyzed by the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., it was found to consist of tablets containing phenobarbital (luminal), some other tablets of a digestive type, and a laxative.

FOOD FADS AND NUTRITION NONSENSE \"If the deductions of many food faddists accepted as \u00a3acts, were really operative, it would be difficult to explain how the human race has survived.\" -U. S. Departme,it of Agriculture Bulletin. The popularity of so-called drugless healing is, probably, a revolt from the Victorian concept that anything could be cured by a nauseous draught from a bottle or by swallowing gargantuan pills. It is a swing of the pendulum from our grandparents' unreasoning belief in the magic efficacy of drugs. The pre\u00ad vailing fashion in the field of medicine has brought with it similar excesses in the field of nutrition. The differences are only those of metier. Competing with medical mountebanks are the diet magicians who would have you believe that corns may be cured by eating cornflakes or that syphilis may be cured by fasting and drinking milk. To a public that is profoundly ignorant of most of the elementary facts in the science of nutrition, the food faddist with his theories and the food quack with his schemes make profitable appeals. While many of the advocates of freak dietary systems are shysters, there is a sprinkling of fanatics who impress one as so ignorant as ~o believe in their own wizardry. To those whose knowledge of the chemistry of food is limited to the elementary superficialities of the teachings of the secondary schools, the food faddist can talk glibly of carbohydratpesp, proteins, fats, mineral salts and, most wonderful of all, vitamins, and his pronouncements, however preposterous, are eagerly swallowed. As a result, there is a veritable plague of \"diet experts\" who, at best, dispense vast quantities of platitudes and piffle on the subject of nutrition and, at the worst, give information that may be as mischievous as it is misleading. The possibility for evil in pseudo-science lies in its plausibility. Its exponents are successful to the extent to which they are able to reduce the complex factors that exist in fact to a simple common denominator of their own creation. Food faddism has proved a gold mine not only for those who practice it but for certain magazines and newspapers which sell to the faddist space that makes it possible for a point of contact to be furnished between him and his victim. The theories put forth by the food faddist usually consist of a small percentage of banalaties of elementary science and a very large percentage of pseudo-scientific buncombe. The occasional rational and obvious thing that the faddists propound misleads intelligent people into accepting ridiculous and com\u00ad mercialized theories. The Alsaker Way.-R L. Alsaker, who received the degree of M.D. from Bennett Medical College of Chicago in 1910, put out a series of \"Books that Teach the Alsaker Way to Health and Efficiency.\" When Dr. Alsaker had been out of medical college barely seven years and was only thirty-four years of age, the advertisements hailed him as \"an eminent authority\" who had \"put the net result of his many years of professional experience with sick people into his writings.\" During an influenza epidemic, public fear was capitalized in an attempt to sell the book: \"The Alsaker Way to Prevent and Cure Influenza, Catarrh, Pneumonia, and Other Troubles of the Nose, Throat, Lungs, Etc.\" The public was reminded of the \"terror that spread over this country during the 'Flu' epidemic when human lives-young and old-were being slaughtered in appalling numbers, and FOOD FADS 53 medical science was powerless to control it.\" The public was told, too, that \"medical science predicts that this horrible destroyer of life is coming back again to work still more frightful havoc.\" All this led up to the statement: \"There is a skilled physician in one of our largest cities who successfully treated hundreds of cases during the epidemic. All who followed this doctor's advice got well. \"In addition, he advised thousands of men and women in scores of other towns and cities of the country-how to protect themselves-and actually defy the epidemic. (These facts can be verified by any genuinely interested inquirer.) \"This skilled physician-R. L. Alsaker, M.D., has put his expert knowledge at everybody's disposal in a printed form which explains in the simplest and plainest English all about the cause, the prevention and the cure of Colds and Influenza, Pneumonia, Catarrh (all forms, chronic and acute) and all kinds of lung, chest, throat, nose, stomach and intestinal troubles which make ourselves and our loved ones easy victims of these dread diseases.\" Another book of Alsaker's was \"Curing Diseases of the Heart and Arteries\" in which were detailed a number of \"clinical cases\" purporting to show the remarkable results produced by Alsaker where other physicians had failed. One would have supposed \u00b7 that even the intelligent layman would have realized that there is no justification for leading the public to believe that diseases of the heart and arteries can safely be self-diagnosed and self-treated. Alsaker's book on this subject might have been counted on to have one very definite effect on the person who accepted its teaching. It might have led any patient who was under the care of a physician because of an impaired circulatory system, to abandon such rational means as the physician might have recommended and attempt self\u00ad treatment \"The Alsaker Way.\" The Alsaker advertising was accepted by many magazines that did not open their pages to ordinary medical advertisements.\u00ad ( Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Dec. 10, 1921.) The Defensive Diet League.-This was fathered by a man who was also interested in the manufacture and sale of, dental supplies and in the publication of a dental journal. Under the circumstances, it was natural that in floating his Defensive Diet League he should have attempted to enlist the attention of the dentists of the country in his scheme. The first annual meeting of the \"League\"' was held in 1923. The \"active membership\" of the League was said to be open to \"dentists, physicians, hygienists and dietitians.\" The annual dues were $10, but there was also an \"associate membership\" that was open to the public with annual dues of $5. The active members received\u00b7 a four-page monthly bulletin that consisted mostly of quotations from various sourc;es-good, bad and indifferent\u00ad and these active members also got occasional supplementary printed material advertising certain sidelines, such as baking powder, a food chart, a steam-pressure cooking utensil and a fruit and vegetable press. The bulletins also recommended and offered for sale certain books as authorities. The books were a hodge-podge of science and ignorance. They comprised not only valuable works by men who really were authorities on nutrition but also worthless tomes put out by food faddist\"s and hobby-riders. One alleged \"authority\" quoted with evident approval was a Los Angeles quack who, on the one hand, played the so-called drugless game, but also under another name exploited on the mail-order plan a drug product that was declared a fraud by the government and debarred from the mails. Another \"authority'' quoted was a mail-order faker who ran a fake health journal and who previously had acted as an advertising expert for Hartman the Perona quack. The lack of dietetic knowledge was exhibited in the League bulletins. Here, for example, was what was laid down as a \"fundamental principle\" : \"All so-called 'diseases' are but so many more or less localized manifestations or symptoms\u00ad vcnts, safety valves, perhaps, warnings at least-of one underlying condition, toxemia, the result of acidosis, brought about by habitual and long-continued eating of the wrong foods at the wrong times or in wrong combinations.\" ---~~-~ ~---~r I 54 FOOD FADS This could only mean, according to such a conception, that a child suffering from diphtheria had merely been eating wrongly; that an individual who had acquired smallpox was paying the penalty of dietetic error; that a person with malaria had simply eaten the wrong food-but why go further? Here then was an organization which attempted to enlist the confidence and help of the dental and medical professions in a campaign for dietary reform, but promoted by an individual who was so ignorant of the most elementary facts of modem medical science that he conceived all disease as being due to wrong methods of eating. Another peculiar view expounded in the League bulletins was that table salt \"has no place in an enlightened diet, never did have, never can have, serves no useful purpose and is wholly destructive.\" There was also reported the cure of malaria brought about by eating sauerkraut (Bulletin No. 4). One of the theories was that when one eats one should not combine two kinds of starchy foods. As Bulletin No. 6 put it, \"combinations of starches are bad\" and \"combinations of starches and proteins are as bad or worse.\" Furthermore, starches, according to Bulletin No. 7, should never be eaten with foods that are digested by the gastric juice. Also : \"None of the fruits can be eaten with starches safely\" (Bulletin No. 8). Summed up, it was stated : \"Don't eat more than one kind of starchy food at any meal\" and \"don't eat more than one kind of protein (meat, eggs, fish, etc.) at any meal\" (Bulletin No. 14). And whatever you do \"don't eat cereal foods at the morning meal\" (Bulletin No. 15). Bulletin No. 17 stated that three cases of goiter had been successfully treated with the expressed juice of chopped cucumbers, carrots and onions as the sole food given on alternate days. Yet there was no reason to believe that the creator of the Defensive Diet League was dishonest or that the League itself was fraudulent. On the contrary, it appeared that the man behind the League was quite sincere. But if the public or the dental and medical professions need instruction on dietetic matters, they should get that instruction from individuals and organizations that have a scientific background and whose elementary knowledge of the science of nutrition is at least equal to that of an ordinary high school pupil. The Defensive Diet League seems to have had no such background and its creator apparently had no such knowledge. -(Condensed froni The Journal A. M. A., J11ne 20, 1925.) Jack Sprat Bread.-This, described as \"the enemy of fat,\" was proclaimed by its exploiters as a \"magical discovery.\" It was said to be \"rich in protein\" and \"unusually low in starch.\" Courteous letters written to the manufacturer, both by individual physicians and by the A. M. A., asking for the proportions of starch and protein in Jack Sprat Bread were ignored. This attitude aroused the suspicion that the exploitation of Jack Sprat Bread was a piece of quackery. It seemed inconceivable that any concern doing a reputable business and putting out a meritorious food product for which high protein and low starch-content were claimed would have any objection to making known just what proportions of protein and carbohydrates the product had. Information on the composition of Jack Sprat Bread was, however, obtained from two independent sources; the analyses agreed in essentials. These showed that Jack Sprat Bread had between 29 and 33 per cent of starch with a total carbohydrate-content ranging from 36 to 40 per cent. Ordinary bread contains about 45 per cent starch and 55 per cent total carbohydrates. The protein-content of Jack Sprat Bread was found to average about 18 per cent as compared with between 9 and 10 per cent in ordinary bread. One of the chemists who analyzed Jack Sprat Bread described it as \"a very ordinary product, resembling a hybrid between a gluten and a whole-wheat bread.\" It was obvious from the analyses that the statement that Jack Sprat Bread was unusually low in starch-content was false, as were also the statements that it was made from an \"anti-starch flour\" and that \"practically all starch is ------- \u00b7-~--- ----. -- FOOD FADS ss removed.\" Neither was it true that the obese could hope to reduce by eating all they wanted, whenever they wanted it. The claim that \"nothing can reduce you as Jack Sprat will\" was sheer quackery.

The obese were led to believe from the advertising that Jack Sprat Bread had positive reducing qualities. It bad nothing of the sort. Those who bought the stuff found that it was necessary to avoid cake, pastry, potatoes, cereals, milk, candies and various other weight-producing foods and that they must eat Jack Sprat Bread in the place thereof. If one avoided exactly the same list of 56 FOOD FADS foods and substituted ordinary white bread for Jack Sprat Bread, reduction could have been brought about at just the same rate. The fat woman who purchased Jack Sprat Bread with the idea of reducing her weight was simply being \"kidded by experts.\"-(Condm.sed from The Jounral A. M. A., Oct. 18, 1924.) Charles B. McFerrin.-This man used to have his headquarters in Chicago, but later trans\u00a3 erred his activities to Florida, a state that is in danger of getting the unenviable reputation of being a lush field for quacks and faddists. McFerrin described himself as a \"Food Scientist, Diet Specialist, Humorist.\" While he had his headquarters in Chicago, he seemed to spend most of his time largely in the south giving alleged \"lectures\" on \"food science\" and organizing \"courses\" among women, apparently his main audience; each member, it was said, paying $1S for the \"course.\" McFerrin's method was to get in touch with women's clubs and offer to deliver one or two \"free lectures.\" These apparently were the \"come-on\" for his \"courses\" in dietetics. He was also reported to have prescribed individual dietaries for which he made a charge. His chief free talk was described as \"his celebrated lecture, 'What's the Matter with Everybody?'\" He had also a special talk which was described somewhat loosely in his advertising leaflets as \"his celebrated lecture on 'Foods That Explode in the Intestines' to women only.\" Just what foods do explode in the intestines, presumably in women only, was not mentioned, but the subject seemed to have interesting possibilities. No better measure of McFerrin's deep and abiding ignorance on the subject of nutrition can be given than to quote some of his own statements. Thus : \"They do not know that the combining of stewed tomatoes and creamed or mashed potatoes bas a strong tendency to tear up the mucous lining of the stomach and intestines, causing constipation, and a general acid or 'sour' condition 0\u00a3 the body, making asthma, nervousness, rheumatism and other maladies possible.\" And this, for example: \"Certain foods also form mucus and pus in the tonsils, kidneys and teeth, and are at the bottom of much catarrbal trouble.\" In addition to the lectures that were free and the courses and prescriptions that were charged for, Mr. McFerrin had for sale Health Bulletins. These were a weird mixture of elementary dietetics, quotations from faddists such as Macfadden, Lindlahr, Alsaker, Tilden and Eugene Christian, and advertisements of fads and quackeries. A good deal of the advertising in the Bulletin was devoted to \"Dr.\" Charles B. McFerrin himself. The amount of misinformation contained in any one copy of McFerrin's Health Bulletin was much too large to be dealt with in detail. A few examples must suffice. On the first page of one of the Bulletins we were told of \"The Value of the Epsom Salts Bath.\" A few quotations from this article will give an idea of McFerrin's conception of physiology and pathology: \"Sickness generally means too much carbon in the body; this carbon may be in the form of mucus; it generally is. \"Epsom Salts water applied externally as a sponge bath or by use by immersion in the bath tub bas a wonderful affinity for carbon, fairly pulling it out of the body. \"'For headaches, sore throats or almost any trouble in distant parts of the body, the neck pack or bandage seems to reach the spot and give much relief. This is because every artery or veill, large or small, of course, passes through the neck and much poison is extracted from the blood as the blood flows through the neck near the Epsom Salts water. \"After an hour's soak in warm water in a bath tub, one may add two or three pounds of Epsom Salts and draw much carbon from the innermost recesses of the body. This is exceed\u00ad ingly helpful in rheumatism particularly. In catarrhal troubles it is a boon, also in asthmatic conditions and also in nervousness.\" M9st cults find it good policy in connection with their offers of short cuts to physical perfection to devote a certain amount of time to persuading their followers ------ -\u00b7 ---------- FOOD FADS 57 that they also off er short cuts to financial and social success. McFerrin, not to be left in the lurch, recommended what he called \"The Rhythmic or Success Breath.\" This particular brand of breathing was one in which the length of time required to inhale and exhale the air into and from the lungs was the same. The \"success\" feature was thus described. \"It has been proved by thousands of our deepest thinkers that if during the progress of the slow rhythmic breathing one will keep the mind on some one thing he may desire, love, harmony, business success, attractiveness, money, etc., that the act of the will power in demanding these things at the same time the breaths are taken will invariably bring about the conditions or things desired.\" Summed up, one would probably do \"Food Scientist, Diet Specialist, Humorist\" McFerrin no injustice in declaring that as a \"food scientist\" and \"diet specialist'' he was a \"humorist.\"-(Condensed from The Journal A.

In addition to advertisements in newspapers, the concern published a number of booklets and pamphlets, issued a monthly house-organ, organized so-called \"food clinics\" and had as a subsidiary advertising organization the high\u00ad sounding \"American Educational Food Council.\" Whether this \"Council\" ever existed except on paper may be a question. The \"president\" of the Whole Grain Wheat Company whose name appeared extensively in much of the advertising advanced the thesis that \"there are but four causes of disease.\" These four causes were described as \"denatured food, denatured air, denatured water and violence.\" Just what meaning was attached to the use of the word \"denatured\" in this con\u00ad nection was not clear. It was stated, for example, that air was denatured when carbon monoxide was added to it. Of course Whole Grain Wheat was said to\u00b7 be not denatured and was claimed to have cured such serious diseases as cancer, tuberculosis, Bright's disease and many other conditions. Whole Grain Wheat was apparently nothing more than the entire grain of wheat partly cooked. According to some of the older claims of the manufacturers, nothing was added to the grain except water, sugar and salt; later claims omitted reference to sugar. Some chemical and biological research work was carried out by the Chemical and Nutrition Laboratories of the American Institute of Baking and the results were published in the April 1925 number of Baking Technology, the official organ of the Institute. There it was reported that a pound of Whole Grain Wheat furnished about 530 calories as compared with from 1100 to 1200 calories furnished by a pound loaf of bread. Experiments to test the life-sustaining properties of Whole Grain Wheat were carried out on young rats selected in their vigorous growing period. The animals in addition to the Whole Grain Wheat were constantly supplied with clean drinking water. Of the six rats that were put on the Whole Grain Wheat ration, three died and the other three were nearly dead at the time the report was made. From this it is not to be inferred that the Whole Grain Wheat killed them; it merely meant that the rats starved to death because the food was incomplete, lacking in certain essentials which were necessary to proper nutri\u00ad tion.-( Condensed from. The Journal A. M.A., May 9, 1925.) Eugene Christian.-This man has been called the dean of American food faddists. He carried after his name the mystic letters \"F. S. D.\", apparently a self\u00ad conferred \"degree.\" Many years ago Christian is said to have been a salesman; then he went into the hotel business ; still later he began the manufacture of fad foods and developed what was known as \"The Christian Natural Food Company.\" At one time he was selling a special brand of bran and running a mail-order \"school\" that he called the \"Eugene Christian School of Applied Food Chen:iistry.\" The original price asked for a \"course\" in this \"school\" was $100 and those who 58 FOOD FADS were interested were told that on completing the \"course\" they would be given a \"diploma\" which would confer on them \"the degree of F. S. D. (Doctor.of Food Science).\" According to the follow-up letters, this \"degree\" gave \"the right to practice the Science of Curative Feeding.\" Those who did not bite easily received follow-up letters in which the price 0\u00a3 the \"course\" was reduced to $45 and in which Christian emphasized that neither a knowledge of chemistry nor a college education was necessary to master the \"course.\" As Christian said: \"It requires only common sense.\" Only l And this in a world in which common sense is certainly much rarer than a college education. The last letter of the follow-up series offered Christian's \"course\" for $10 and the prospective purchaser was told that on completing the \"course\" he would be qualified \"to diagnose all stomach and intestinal trouble and to prescribe This is a reproduction of the \"diploma\" issued by Eu,ene Christian to those who took his mail order \"course\" in the \"School of Applied Chemistry.' a curative remedial or normal diet therefore.\" Some years after the \"Eugene Christian School of Applied Food Chemistry'' had faded into the limbo of forgotten fads, Christian was operating the \"Christian Dietetic Society and School of Scientific Eating\" which sold a \"Course in Scientific Eating.\" The price asked was first $10, later reduced to $5. This organization went the way of the others and then Christian, with two other persons, incorporated \"The Corrective Eating Society\" under which name Christian's \"course\" was again advertised, this time for $3. This \"Course in Scientific Eating\" purported to give to persons who had no fundamental knowledge of the human body or its processes alleged instruction in the treatment and cure of disease by a so-called dietetic \"system\"-a system devised by an individual who, scientifically, was as ignorant as those he would teach. The blind leading the blind. Those who purchased Christian's \"course\" were later badgered with letters urging them to buy his new five volume \"Encyclopedia of Diet\" which was described as \"the crowning achievement of the world's greatest food scientist.\" Nor was this all. Purchasers still later received a letter signed Eugene Christian, suggesting that if the recipients were \"afflicted with any digestive, FOOD FADS 59 assimilative or eliminative disorders\" they should, by all means, fill in the diagnosis \u00b7 blank (enclosed) and send it with $45 to Christian for a mail-order diagnosis and treatment. During 1922 and 1923 the Corrective Eating Society commercialized the fad for a svelte figure and advertised the \"Vaco Reducing Cup\" which was said to remove fat as one uses \"an eraser to remove a pencil mark.\" The Vaco Reducing Cup was made of rubber and very similar in construction to the rubber appliances sold by the \"bust developer\" fakers. One woman who purchased a Vaco Reducing Cup and found that it was valueless except as a means of raising welts decided to turn the thing to some real use. By attaching a piece of broomstick to it, she found she had a fairly efficient force pump for flushing the drain pipe of the kitchen sink. ~:a,,,food fad clientele offers other opportunities for separating the gullible from his gold. In the early part of 1921 those who were on Christian's \"sucker list\" received a circular letter addressed to his \"patients and readers.\" This letter was to the effect that Christian had cured a diabetic Texan who was interested in the oil business. In gratitude the Texas gentleman came to New York and told Eugene Christian that he had \"50 acres of ground in the center of the richest oil field in the world\" and he wanted Christian to get in with him on the ground floor. The letter then stated that Christian had put \"every available dotlar\" he had \"into the enterprise.\" All leading up to the suggestion that the recipients of his printed letter should join Christian. He wanted one thousand of the many \"prospects\" to whom he was sending this letter to send him $100 each for the purchase of ten shares apiece. More than ten shares could be had if desired. The check was to be made payable to the oil company but sent to Christian.-(Condensed from Hygeia, January, 1925.) Yergin's Natural Health School.-Milo E. Yergin, who sometimes put \"Dr.' before and occasionally \"D. O.\" and \"D. C.\" after his name, was in the food fad business for many years. He conducted such concerns as the \"National Health League Sanitarium,\" the \"National Health League Institute\" and the \"National Health League Food Plant.\" He also had at one time an \"Institute of Reactive Therapeutics\" which was operated from Chicago and sold Yergin's \"Home Study Course of Structural Dietetics\"-price $25. Yergin was not reticent about his alleged educational qualifications. According to his advertising, he had ''spent fully \u00b7fourteen years in the various schools of medicine in postgraduate work,\" dis\u00ad tributed variously in the \"Homeopathic, Eclectic, Physiomedical and Chiropractic Schools,\" with six years in the \"Allopathic or regular\" school. Yergin's accomplish\u00adments were wide : He had been a vegetarian chef and a \"faculty member of the National School of Chiropractic\" ; he was \"well versed in hydrotherapy\" and had a \"practical knowledge of osteopathy and spondylotherapy.\" Some years ago Yergin was in Nashville, Tenn., and the local papers discussed \"the broad plans\" that were being laid for his \"wide and effectual distribution of the products of the League Food Plant.\" It seems that it w~s the plan to make Nashville the headquarters of the League and the \"home of the Health Food Factory.\" In 1920 Milo E. Yergin was president of the \"Cooperative Food Company\" of Chicago. This company was pushing \"Dr. Yergin's Pus and Pain Chart\" (price $10), a marvel that enabled one \"with the simple foods of nature\" to control and obliterate in from fifteen minutes to fifteen hours any kind of pain and all pus\u00b7 conditions. The chart was a mimeographed affair of twenty pages. Apparently, one could not work these marvels unless, in addition to the chart, he purchased certain \"natural foods described in this chart.\" These foods comprised others. These were all for sale by Yergin's Cooperative 60 FOOD FADS Food Company at prices ranging from 25 cents to $3 a package. The concern also put out a \"chemically pure Epsom Salt,\" price $1 a pound. The name of the Cooperative Food Company was later changed to \"N. H. S. Food Plant.\" The \"Natural Health School\" itself seemed to combine religious fanaticism with medical quackery. Scripture was quoted freely and in 1922 the Natural Health School Journal declared that the world would come to an end within the next two years. But, though Yergin declared that the world would come to an end in 1924, he nevertheless urged his followers to buy stock in the Natural Health School. Possibly it is a misnomer to speak of \"buying\" this stock, although it was Yergin's own phrase, for it appears that the stock was \"non\u00ad interest bearing\" and \"pays no dividends after the manner of this world.\" Yergin permitted any person to purchase as much stock as he desired, price $100-cash, after the manner of this world l In addition to his food fads, Yergin developed another theory as interestingly bizarre as any ever offered by those who live by their wits. He put forward a \"True Musical Therapy\" whereby with the aid of a Thia School lnatructa How to Oblitorato Tubcrculoaia in AU Stairea, In 24 to 48 Houn, and Rcatoro Sound Health NATURAL - -- HEALTH NIii ' n.c-..__.

Keep the keys sounding for a few moments, and it will start a bowel action,\" As not all people can play the piano, Yergin had under consideration-provided the world did not come to an end before he was able to carry it out-the idea of writing out \"true therapeutical music, perforated on rolls\" so that those who wished to have their health restored could buy a roll and place it in a player piano.\u00ad ( Condensed from Hygeia, February, 1925.) Yoghurt, Incorporated.-This was located in the.state of Washington. Orig\u00ad inally its name had been Yoghurt Company and its business was at that time confined largely to the ~!le of tablets alleged to co1tain the Bulgarian bacillus. Under its later name it exploited certain \"treatments,\" the chief of which seemed to be the \"Phoenix Cure.\" This was said to consist \"of all the foods you will need for three months, except a small quantity of fruits and vegetables.\" The price was $36, which for three months' food was cheap enough. In addition to ---------------------------\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7~- -------- I FOOD FADS 61 the Phoenix Cure, there was also a \"Mineral Salt Treatment\" which was said to be a perfect blood nerve food and regenerator of the entire system-price $15. There was also a ''Vitamin Treabnent,\" price $8; and, if you were skinny, a $10 \"Flesh Builder Treatment,\" not to mention the \"Healthy Skin Treatment\" that was for those who bad a skin you bate to touch. Later Yoghurt, Inc. flourished to the extent that it operated a \"Temple of Health\" with eighty-five rooms, a staff of nurses and a drugless healer. The diseases treated at the \"Temple of Health\" were arranged alphabetically from Acne to Varicose Veins. Apparently they treated nothing beyond \"V.\" Sufferers from Wry-neck to Zoster had to go else\u00adwhere. Yoghurt, Inc. also advertised that it had a cure for cancer and about the same time was offering to the public what it called \"8 per cent. convertible gold notes\" as a means of raising capital. . The concern promised to pay back the original capital in five years and 8 per cent a year, semi-annually, for the use of the money.-(Condensecl from Hneia, February, 192S.) \"FEMALE REMEDIES\" Under what, for want of a better term, one might call \"Female Remedies,\" are listed products so advertised as to appeal particularly to women and alleged to be for the cure or alleviation of ailments more or less peculiar to women. Such remedies fall within four groups. There are the Tonics whose most potent ingredient-and the \"repeater\" element-is alcohol. These alcoholic pick-me-ups, also, usually contain some bitters and not infrequently extractives of drugs, that, before the days of scientific medicine, were supposed to have some special value in the treatment of ailments peculiar to women. The second group is that of A11algesics or pain-relievers. These usually come in the form of tablets but occasionally are sold in powder or even liquid form. The chief ingredient of this group is acetanilid, acetphenetidin, antipyrine or some other coal-tar derivative that has a heart-depressing effect. Aspirin and amido\u00adpyrine have also come into very general use as ingredients in this group. All of these preparations are potentially dangerous and all of them are used to deaden Nature's warning that something is wrong. The . third group comprises the Emmenagogues-pills and potions that are sold for the alleged restoration of suppressed menstruation. Many of these preparations are bought in the belief that they are abortifacients and that they will terminate an unwanted pregnancy. The facts are, practically none of these preparations will reestablish the menstrual flow when its cessation has been due to pregnancy. There is, in fact, no drug or medicine known that will terminate pregnancy without seriously endangering the woman's life. The fourth and last group comprises the Contraceptives-preparations that are purchased for the prevention of conception. Not that they are advertised for that purpose, for there is still on the federal statute books a law that makes such adver\u00ad tising risky. Usually such products are sold under the claim that they are for \"feminine hygiene,\" a term which has become largely a euphonious one for contra\u00ad ception. Most of the preparations sold, or at least purchased, for the purpose of contraception are quite worthless. At the end of this chapter there is a list of preparations sold for the treatment of women's ailments and that have been found to have violated the National Food and Drugs Act of 1906 usually because the curative claims made for them were fraudulent. Seeqit.-This was an analgesic (pain relieving) tablet exploited by unusual methods. Instead of advertising the product in the newspapers and placing it on the shelves of the drug stores, the exploiters circularized women's colleges and large industrial concerns that employed women. These circular letters suggested that Seeqit be distributed to the women when they were more or less incapacitated for work by menstrual disturbances. Seeqit was described as \"the great industrial tablet which will create 100 per cent efficiency and bring health and happiness to your women workers.\" When the A. M. A. began receiving inquiries regarding Seeqit, a letter was written to the concern that put it out asking whether it cared to send any information regarding the composition of its preparation. The company, after some hesitation, sent in what purported to be the names and quantities of the essential ingredients of Seeqit, but stated in the letter that it authorized such information to be given out only to \"any duly registered physician\" and not in any other way. The letter was returned with the statement that, as Seeqit was for the FEMALE REMEDIES 63 use of the general public rather than the medical profession and as, further, the A. M. A. accepted no information regarding the composition of medicinal products in confidence, but only for the purpose of passing on such information to those who had a moral right to it, the information furnished could not be accepted under the restrictions imposed. The Seeqit concern then replied that they were willing the Association should give the information regarding the composition of Seeqit to any physician or layman who inquired, but that it would not authorize its publication in any other way. In view of these restrictions, original specimens of Secqit were obtained and turned over to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory for analysis. The chemists reported that each tablet of Seeqit consisted essentially of about 3\u00bc grains of amidopyrine (pyramidon) and approximately 1 grain of caffeine with fillers. They sold for $4.50 per 100. One can buy five-grain tablets of arnidopyrine U. S. P. for less than $1.50 ,a hundred. Certainly Seeqit could produce no effect that could not be produced equally well by a plain tablet of amidopyrine U. S. P. The spectacle of large industrial concerns, dispensing ''patent medicines\" at an exorbitant price, when the same drugs under their official names could be purchased ane one-third the price and would answer the same purpose, was edifying neither from the viewpoint of public health nor from that of economics.-(Condcnsed froni The Journal A. M. A., Nov. 26, 1927.) Viavi.-For years there was exploited throughout the United States an unscientific system known as \"Viavi.\" This w.as not the name of a preparation; it was a generic name given to a long list of nostrums put out by the Viavi The exploiters of Viavi did but little newspaP.er advertising, although once in a while some branch agency inserted a small advertisement s1m1lar to the ones here reproduced. A noticeable exception to this rule occurred right after the expose by the Califcmiia State Jo1u-nal of Medicine in 1907. Two San Francisco newspapers made some reference to Viavi at that time. Imme\u00ad diately large advertisements appeared in all the San Francisco newspapers. No further news paper criticism appeared! \"Whose Bread I Eat, His Song I Sing.\" Company. Practically all of the preparations were sold for the alleged alleviation or cure of diseases peculiar to women. There were \"Viavi Capsules,\" \"Viavi Cerate,\" \"Viavi Liquid,\" etc. The basis of most of the Viavi preparations, so far as analyses have been made of them, seems to have been golden seal (hydrastis). The Viavi concern did little newspaper advertising, the business being carried on by means of agents. Many years ago there was an exception to this rule. The California State Journal of Medicine for April 1907 published a detailed expose of the Viavi scheme and, at that time, two San Francisco newspapers made some reference to Via vi. Immediately thereafter, large advertisements appeared in many of the San Francisco newspapers. No further newspaper criticism appeared and one of the papers that had referred to the medical article printed a complimentary little write-up about the men who were operating this quackery and about their enterprise. In 1927 a well known physician in the middle west wrote that he had just been called to see a young woman, aged 27, the mother of an eight-year-old 64 FEMALE REMEDIES child. He had known her for many years and had been the attending physician of the family. He was called out suddenly to see the woman on account of a severe uterine hemorrhage. On examination he found unmistakable evidence of cancer of the neck of the womb of several months' standing. The history of the case was that the young woman, some four months previously began to lose weight, had severe pelvic pains, backache, discharge, etc., and her husband told her to go to the family physician\u00b7 for a complete examination. A neighbor, however, advised her to see the local Viavi agent first, which she did. From the agent she got two bottles of medicine, one costing $9.50 and the other $3.50. The agent sent the woman's \"symptoms\" to a Viavi branch headquarters and there came back a diagnosis by mail that the condition was probably a \"cyst\" which would require several months' Viavi treatment to absorb l After some weeks of treatment with no improvement, the Viavi agents sent a woman physician who made examination and pronounced it cancer. She recommended that the sufferer go to Detroit and take the Koch treatment l Before the poor woman could decide what to do, the lesion ulcerated into an artery with a serious hemorrhage. As the family physician wrote; \"Four months ago there might have been a chance to save the life of this young mother;. today, the case is practically hopeless.\"-(Co,ulensed from The Journal A. M.

KIDNEY DISEASE NOSTRUMS In kidney disease it is often found that the kidney structure has undergone destructive changes of a degree depending on the severity and length of time that the disease has been in progress. When such changes have taken place, it is obvious that nothing can replace the structures that have been destroyed, any more than giving a pill to a man who has lost his arm will make a new arm grow. This does not mean that all kidney disease is incurable. Its ravages may be checked in many cases if properly and early treated. Careful attention to diet and hygiene are the important elements of treatment. Occasionally it is necessary to give the patient some drugs in connection with the treatment, but they have to be given with great care and with the full appreciation of the patient's condition; otherwise they may do more harm than good. The popular idea that every pain in the lower part of the back means kidney disease has been kept alive by the \"kidney cure\" fakers. Broadly speaking there is, as a matter of fact, little, if any, relation\u00ad ship between a pain in the lumbar region and diseases of the kidney and, as a rule, there is no pain connected with kidney disease except in its last stages. Drugs alone will not cure kidney disease. The harm that may be done the weakened and diseased system by the powerful drugs frequently sold as cures for kidney disease is not the only element of danger in the use of these nostrums. Equally dangerous to the patient is the belief engendered by the quacks that the drug is the important element in the treatment. Most of us are still firmly wedded to the old fallacy that any disease can be cured by taking something out of a bottle three or four times a day. In kidney disease, hygienic and dietetic measures are the essentials of treatment, although the physician may occasionally give drugs to meet certain complications as they arise. While dietetic and hygienic treatment, if intelligently persisted in, may often result in the arrest of the disease, such treatment may mean a certain amount of discomfort to the patient, a breaking of old habits, a readjustment of one's life. Then comes the \"patent medicine\" faker who blatantly declares: \"My remedy cures kidney disease I\" It is not to be wondered at that the patient, easily convinced because the wish is father to the thought, argues: Why should I subject myself to the discomforts of a rigorous diet and a change in my mode of living when I can be cured by taking \"Dr. Killem's Kidney Kure?\" There are certain broad principles that should govern the \"patent medicine\" business. One of these is that there is no moral or economic excuse for the sale of home remedies that are recommended for diseases that are far too serious to be self-treated. Kidney disease is such a disease. Every \"patent medicine\" sold for the cure of kidney disease is potentially dangerous and inherently vicious. Cystex.-This was sold for the self-treatment of self-diagnosed disease con\u00ad ditions of the bladder and kidneys. Its composition varied. In 1934 its alleged formula was seemingly based on the alternate acid and alkaline treatment of infections of the urinary tract, although it contained neither enough acid nor alkali to be effective. The public was told that Cystex not only was a \"gentle aid to the Kidneys,\" but, in addition, it \"soothes and tones raw, sore, irritated bladder and urinary membranes.\" The theme that the stuff was a cure for \"kidney diseases\" was played up thus: \"Clean Out Your Kidneys. Win Back Your Pep. Good Kidney Action Purihes Your Blood-Often Removes the Real Cause of Getting Up Nights, Neuralgia and Rheumatic Pains -Quiets Jumpy Nerves and Makes You Feel 10 Years Younger.\" 68 KIDNEY REMEDIES The exploiters of Cystex published as part of the trade package (which brought it under the provisions of the National Food and Drugs Act of ,1906) a list of the ingredients of Cystex, which came in tablet form. The package contained two kinds of tablets, gray and brown. Prior to 1929 the gray tablets were claimed to have the following ingredients : Hexamethylenamine, calcium phosphate, powdered extract of colchium and thyroid substance. Later the thyroid substance was dropped out of the formula, but for a while the other three ingredients were retained. The brown tablets, prior to 1929, were said to contain: Extracts of hydrangea, buchu, corn silk and triticum, potassium bicarbonate, boric acid and atropine sulfate. The composition of these brown tablets did not undergo the drastic changes that the Bladder Weakness Makes You Feel Old Getting Up Nights, backache, burn'.' ing sensation, and other bladder\u00b7 conditions often hurt sleep, cause nervousness and lower vitality.

In a publication, Drug Topics, for October, 1933, there was a full-page advertisement headed \"Cystex Has No Secrets.\" There was given in this advertisement what purported to be the \"actual working formula\" of Cystex. This read as follows : GRAY TABLETS Hexamethylenamine .......... Extract Nux Vomica .................................... Acid Benzoic ................................... BROWN grain 1 grain 1\u00bd grains %oo grain \u00bds grain KIDNEY REMEDIES 69 The objection to Cystex was simple and fundamental: There is no legitimate place for the self-treatment of pathologic conditions of the kidneys or bladder. It is sheer madness for persons who have the symptom-complex described in the Cystex advertisements to attempt to treat themselves and waste what well may he vitally valuable time before seeking competent treatment based on a rational diagnosis.-(Condensed frotn The Jounzal A.

The first is that a daily bowel movement is absolutely essential to health and the second. is that the use of laxatives is harmless and without danger. The facts are, as has been well stated by Dr. Fantus, that with the average adult a daily bowel movement is not a necessity for a state of health and, further, cathartics are habit-producing drugs which should be used only in cases of temporary disturbance and only occasionally by the normal person and never habitually. Some years ago, a British physician urged that advertisements of laxatives should be attacked by the medical profession as inimical to the public health and it was his opinion that the giving of cathartics to children should be prohibited except under medical super\u00ad vision. What the public does not realize is that laxative drugs are probably among the most frequent causes of constipation, for such drugs produce evacuation from over-stimulation of the intestinal tract. As Fantus has well put it : \"Even the mildest and blandest laxatives as well as enemas must be charged with a tendency to get the bowel into sluggish habits, for the very ease with which soft or liquid contents pass along the large bowel diminishes the necessity for muscular effort and leads to atony and ultimate atrophy.\" In this brief chapter, no attempt is made to list any large number of laxative drugs of laxative \"patent medicines,'' but a few preparations that have been dealt with either briefly or extensively in the Bureau of Investigation Department of The J oiirnal A. M. A. are described. There is also included in this chapter an article by the author, on \"Salts and Crystals,\" that was published originally in H ygeia\u00ad this because of the pernicious fad that has developed during the past few years of advertising saline cathartics not merely for their cathartic effect but for their alleged weight reduction properties. Apple-Lax.-This preparation depended for its laxative effect not on the concentrated apple juice which entered into its composition but on the presence of the drug phenolphthalein. The government declared that the claims made for Apple-Lax were false and misleading and that the product was misbranded.\u00ad [N. J. 22614; 1935.] Bran-O-Lax Tablets.-The public purchase these \"Laxative Wheat-Bran Tablets for constipation and indigestion instead of those severe and harmful drugs.\" The essential claim, either inferred or expressed, was to the effect that Bran-O-Lax Tablets were wheat bran in a condensed form and that they were free from \"harmful drugs.\" In a booklet sent out by the concern and entitled \"Vitamine Bran-O-Lax\" the public was told that vitamins are \"subtile principals [sic I] in the foods absolutely necessary to life.\" The Bran-O-Lax concern urged the druggist to stock the tablets as the company would \"guarantee your sales\" and \"your profits are 50% net.\" In order to get facts rather than fiction, Bran-O-Lax Tablets were analyzed by the chemists of the A. M. A. To the unaided eye the tablets appeared to be composed of compressed bran. They had a sweet taste and the odor and flavor of peppermint. The only information regard\u00ad ing the composition was the statement that each tablet contained a heaping table\u00ad spoon of wheat-bran compressed into tablet form and that it was vegetable and harmless. The chemists reported that the tablets averaged 35\u00be grains each in ---, 72 LAXATIVES weight. They also found by experiment that a heaping tablespoon of wheat-bran weighed about 166 grains. They found too that the tablets contained reducing sugar (probably glucose) in large amounts and a gummy substance, probably acacia. Most important, however, the chemists disclosed the presence of about 1 grain of phenolphthalein to each tablet. From the chemists' report it was obvious, first, that a Bran-0-Lax Tablet, which weighed only about 35\u00be grains, could not contain a heaping tablespoonful of bran, which weighs about 166 grains, especially when it is considered that, in addition to bran, there were in the tablets also glucose and some gummy material to bind the bran together, as well as the laxative, phenol\u00ad phthalein; second, the real laxative element in a Bran-0-Lax Tablet was not bran but phenolphthalein, a coal tar derivative, well known for its laxative properties; third, as phenolphthalein is a synthetic product, that is, one which does not occur in Nature, the statement that \"Bran-0-Lax is Nature's own remedy\" and is \"vegetable in formation\" was false and misleading.-(Coudeused from The Journal A.M .A., Oct. 16, 1920.) Cascarets (Chocolate Flavor).-Government officials charged that this product was misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act because of fraudulent claims made for it as a remedy for habitual constipation, etc. The chemists of the Food and Drugs Administration reported that the preparation consisted of lozenges containing laxative drugs, including over 2 grains of phenol\u00ad phthalein to the lozenge. These were incorporated in sweetened, flavored chocolate. The original Cascarets, as the name would indicate, depended, for its laxative action, upon cascara sagrada, whereas the active ingredient in the chocolate flavored Cascarets was phenolphthalein.-(N. l. 21777; 1934.) Colonaid.-Reported to be essentially milk sugar, casein (dried milk curd), dextrin and small amounts of starch, phenolphthalein, calcium phosphate, potassium compound and carbonates.-(N. l. 22019; 1934.) Edrolax.-Reported to be essentially a mixture of mucilaginous seeds, including psyllium, with agar-agar and caramel. The therapeutic claims made for it were declared fraudulent.-(~- J. 21226; 1934.) Germania Herb Tea.-Reported to be essentially senna leaves with smaller amounts of other plant drugs, including corn-flower, arnica and bearberry.-[N. water.-[N. l. 20734; 1934.] Inner-Clean.-This was said to be the discovery of \"Prof. Arnold Ehret\"\u00ad whoever he may have been-the \"Originator of Mucusless-Diet Healing System.\" Inner-Clean, we Nature\"; Thoroughly Cleanses and Rejuvenates Relaxed, Flabby Intestines.\" The special efficiency of Inner-Clean was said to be due to its \"ability to remove from the intestines hardened feces, mucus age-old uneliminated, imperfectly digested, fatty the Intestines as Effectively as a Brush,\" said the advertiser, and illustrated its action by showing a bottle-brush in use. Whatever your particular ailment, \"whether Indigestion, Nervousness, Boils, Head\u00ad ache, Rheumatism, Gout, Constipation or a general run-down condition, it can be directly traced to a clogged condition of the bowels.\" Those who ordered Inner\u00ad Clean by mail were sent, in addition to the preparation, a four-page leaflet advertising the \"Mucusless-Diet Healing System\" by Prof. Arnold Ehret. The ''system\" apparently was a book which sold for $1.50 and was published by the Ehret Literature Publishing Company, having the same address as the Inner\u00ad Clean Manufacturing Company. Ehret's thesis seemed to be that all ill health is due to constipation which in turn is due to \"wrong eating.\" A woman who LAXATIVES 73 had purchased Inner-Clean consulted a San Francisco physician relative to what she thought were particles of glass that she found in the Inner-Clean. Investigation in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. disclosed that the substance was sand and not glass. This point was of interest because the instructions that went with Inner-Clean carried a warning that it should not be chewed. Some packages of Inner-Clean were purchased and submitted to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory for examination. It was found to be essentially a mixture of chopped-up herbs, mainly senna, with some indigestible residue in the form of agar and a varying amount of sand. The harm that a mixture of that sort might do to an inflamed mucous mem\u00ad brane or an\u00b7 inflamed intestinal mucous membrane can easily be realized by physicians and even intelligent laymen.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 20, 1926.) Naturade Tablets.-Reported to be essentially phenolphthalein with plant extractives, including nux vomica, and a laxative with calcium sulfate.-[N. J. 22345; 1934.] Rainey's Laxatives.-Reported to consist of uncoated tablets containing chalk, nux vomica, a laxative and a small amount of iron compound.-[N. J. 22180; 1934.] Sal Hepatica.-This has been on the market for many years. At first it was advertised exclusively in medical journals, but later entered the \"patent medicine\" field and was advertised directly to the public. Many years ago, the medical journal advertisements for Sal Hepatica contained this statement regarding its composition: \"Sal Hepatica contains all of the Tonic, Alterative and Laxative Salts of the celebrated 'Bitter Waters' of Europe, especially those of Bohemia, as determined by actual chemical analysis of these waters, and fortified by the addition of Lithium and Sodium Phosphates.\" The old-time medical advertisements also declared that \"Sal Hepatica is the most powerful solvent of Uric Acid known.\" In 1921 the chemists of the A. M. A. analyzed Sal Hepatica and reported that at that time it was essentially an effervescing mixture of dried Glauber's salt and sodium tar\u00ad trate with a little dried sodium phosphate and table salt. A comparison of that analysis with an earlier one indicated that considerable changes had been made in the formula in that the proportions of sodium phosphate had been reduced while the baking soda and tartaric acid had been increased and the citric acid eliminated.-(Cotidensed from The Journal A. M. A., Oct. 29, 1921.) \"Salts\" and \"Crystals\" Few laxatives, in fact, few medicines of any kind, are more generally used and abused by the public than are the saline cathartics, for the nonmedically trained person is quite unaware of the fact that salines should be classed among the habit\u00adforming drugs and that they are responsible for a large proportion of cases of ~thartic habit. The salines do not produce evacuation by stimulating peristalsis, the wavelike movements of the intestines, but by distending the intestines with fluid. They are especially objectionable in those cases of chronic coustipation in which the intestines lack muscular \"tone,\" for they not only fail to overcome the lack of tone but they tend to increase it by reducing the need for peristaltic activity because, obviously liquid contents are more easily propelled than are solid ones. During the past few years there has been a veritable flood of \"patent medicines\" of the saline-cathartic type, many of them put out under the name of crystals. The crystals quackery seems to be largely the result of imitativeness on the part of nostrum exploiters. A \"patent medicine\" called Crazy Crystals, which was put on the market a few years ago, was ballyhooed extensively over the radio, with the result that the self-dosing public was made, as the advertising man would put it, \"crystals conscious.\" Imitations followed. 74 LAXATIVES The continued, and especially the daily, use of salts is pem1c1ous to a degree. Such dosing may be justified in certain serious conditions in which the intestines are partially blocked, by cancer, for instance, and in patients who for some reason cannot be relieved surgically. An authority on the subject has well said of cathartic salts, \"That they are occasion:il accessory causes of death from ileus (due to intestinal obstruction) and appendical and other forms of peritonitis is only too well known to the surgeon.\" It is not to be understood that saline cathartics have no place in medicine, or that they should never be taken. They may, in fact, be valuable drugs in the treatment of certain conditions. But their indiscriminate use is as wholly unjustified as is the belief that they are quite harmless. One of the chief claims, and in some instances the only important claim, made for some of the numerous advertised \"crystals\" and salines is that they are cures for obesity. The way in which purgatives act as alleged cures for obesity is to hurry the food through the intestines before a large part of it can be properly digested. In the case of the salines, some weight is also temporarily removed by drawing water from the tissues into the bowels. In the paragraphs that follow, there are described briefly some of the salines that had a vogue : Abllena Crystals.-These were found to be essentially dried Glauber salts (\"horse salts\") with small quantities of epsom salt and table salt. Because of fraudulent curative claims, these were declared misbranded.-[N. J. 21215; 1934.) Crazy Crystals.-This product was said to be the crystals formed by evaporating \"Crazy Mineral Water.\" The exploiters of the water have published in the past what purported to be the ingredients of their product. While the ingredients have varied in detail at different times, they all reveal that the chief mineral ingredient is sodium sulfate (Glaubcr's salt, or the \"horse salts\" of the veterinarian). In the advertising ballyhoo over the radio, attempts were made to lead the public to believe that Crazy Crystals was not a drug, As a matter of fact, it was nothing else but a drug. Dismuko's Famous Mineral Crystals.-This product was supposed to be crystals obtained by evaporation of the water at Mineral Wells, Texas, but the federal chemists showed that it did not represent the total nonvolatile material in that water. It was found to consist essen\u00ad tially of sodium sulfate (Glauber's salt), with small proportions of chlorides and magnesium compound. The government charged that the curative claims made for it were false and fraud\u00ad ulent and the court sustained the charge [N. J. 22956). On May 28. 1934 the court ordered that the product be destroyed. Georgia Crystal Compound.-This \"patent medicine\" was labeled so as to give the impression that it was obtained from the waters of \u00b7warm Springs, Ga., but it was found by the federal chemists to consist essentially of sodium sulfate (Glauber's salt). Some of the curative claims made for it were declared false and fraudulent [N. J. 22638) and in June 1934 the court ordered that a shipment of the product be destroyed. German Fruit Salt.-Sce article under the same title in chapter \"Mail Order Concerns.\" Geuda Springs Crystals.-This product came from the Geuda Crystal Company of Geuda Springs. Kan., and varied somewhat in composition from most of the so-called crystals on the market. Instead of being mainly Glauber's salt (sodium sulfate), it had but a small pro\u00ad portion of tbi.s substance in it, with equally small proportions of epsom salt and sulfate of lime. The main ingredient was common table salt, of which it contained more than 92 per cent. The advertising that went with the trade package gave the impression that Geuda Springs Crystals contained sodium bromide. sodium iodide and sodium biborate; as a matter of fact, no iodides, bromides or borates were present. This in itself constituted misbranding under the National Fooci and Drugs Act, but the product was stilt further misbranded because the claim that it was a remedy for stomach trouble, liver and kidney disorders, rheumatism, sinus trouble, eczema and various other conditions was declared fradulent. The Geuda Springs Company admitted in August 1933 that the charges of the government were true [N. J. 21568) and the court entered judgment of condemnation. Jad Salts.-Products known as Jad Salts have been on the market for many years. At first Jad Salts was advertised as a \"kidney cure\" and, as such. was declared misbranded in 1923 under the National Food and Drugs Act because of the fraudulent claims made for it. Jad Salts, the \"kidney cure,\" contained tartaric acid. citric acid, lithium carbonate. sodium LAXATIVES 75 phosphate, potassium bicarbonate, table salt, baking soda and hexamethylenamine. About 1930 there was apparently a slump in the kidney cure game and Jad Salts began to be advertised as an \"obesity cure.'' It appears to have had the same ingredients that it had when sold as a \"kidney\" cure,\" except that the baking soda and hexamethylenamine had been dropped. StilJ more recently there have been advertisements for what is called Condensed Jad Salts. This product is said to contain tartartic acid, citric acid, sodium phosphate, magnesium carbonate, baking soda and that good old standby, Glauber's salt or \"horse salts\" (sodium sulfate). Jad Salts was first advertised as a \"kidney cure.\" About 1930, however, there was appar\u00ad entfy a slump in the kidney cure game, and Jad Salts then began to appear on the market advertised as an \"obesity cure.\" Lady Grace Mineral Crystals.-This nostrum ran true to form. It was another saline, con\u00ad sisting, according to the federal chemists, of crystallized sodium \u00b7 sulfate, or Glauber's salt, with a trace of table salt. It was marketed by the Grace Natural Mineral Company of Omaha, Neb. While the stuff was represented to be a natural product, the federal chemists pointed out that the sodium sulfate, which was practically the only Ingredient, was present in a form that is never found in nature. One of the chief claims \u00a3or this \"patent medicine\" was that it was an obesity cure. The stuff was declared misbranded under the National Food and , Drugs Act because of fraudulent claims made for it. In October 1933 the Grace Natural Mineral Company admitted [N. J. 21516] that the government cbarges were true and the court entered a judgment of condemnation against the product. Marfin Mlnoral Crystals.-These, too, were reported to be essentially Glaubers;alt \u00b7 (\"horse salts\") with small amounts of table salt and traces of epsom salt and magnesium carbonate. The claim that these were remedies for kidney and bowel disorders, rheumatism, etc., was declared fraudulcnt.-[N. J. 20900.] \u00b7 Mineralcrystals.-This product was put out by the Mineral Wells Crystal and Water Com\u00ad pany of Mineral Wells, Texas, and was sold as a remedy for stomach trouble, kidney and bladder trouble, rheumatism, arthritis, high blood pressure, bad complexion, diabetes, gout and \"many other diseases.\" It was analyzed by the federal chemists, who reported that it was essentially dried sodium sulfate (98.7 per cent); that is, Glauber's salt or \"horse salts.\" It also had a small proportion of common salt, chalk, magnesium carbonate and washing soda. The stuff was declared misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act in July 1933 [N. l. 21236] because of the false and fraudulent claims made for it. 76 LAXATIVES Mineral Wells Crystala.-This nostrum, according to advertising in the files of the Bureau of Investigation of the A. M. A., was \"Made at Mineral Wells, Texas.\" It was another one of the horse-salts preparations (Glauber's salt, sodium sulfate) with a minute proportion of other salts. Some of this preparation shipped from one state to another was seized by federal authorities on the charge that it was misbranded. The government charged fraudulence in the claims that it would relieve rheumatism and diseases of the kidney, liver, blood and skin and probably 90 per cent of all diseases. In January 1934 the court entered judgment of con\u00ad demnation against the product and ordered [N. J. 21810) that the product be destroyed by the United States marshal. IF YOU WANT TO REGAIN PHYSICAL LOVELINESS AND HEALTHFUL VIGOR W NO STARVING - NO EXERCISE! 1J Fat Just Seems to Melt Away The chief claim made for Sleepy Salts was that it would make \"fat go fast.\" Federal charges of misbranding because of fraudulent claims were sustained by the court, Sleepy Salts.-This product was so advertised as to lead the public to believe that it was a \"synthetic proximation\" of a mineral water known as \"Sleepy Water.\" The composition of the water, according to the past advertising, has varied. Government analysis of Sleepy Salts has shown that nearly SO per cent was sodium sulfate (\"horse salts\" or Glauber's salt) com\u00ad bined with about 35 per cent of epsom salt and a small amount of table salt. The chief claim for Sleepy Salts was that it would make \"fat go fast.\" The federal authorities declared the stuff misbranded because of fraudulent claims. The court sustained the charges [N. J. 21531) and ordered that the product be destroyed. Min water Crystals.-This. preparation, whlch was said to \"keep you healthy\" and to be ''Nature's way to health\" was alleged to be a remedy for diabetes, stomach, bladder and kidney ailments and numerous other conditions. It was marketed by the Minwater Crystals Company of Dallas, Texas. Like most of the so-called crystals OD the market, it was found to be dried Glauber's salt (sodium sulfate) with minute proportions of washing soda and table salt. The ----~---~ -s--- ----------- LAXATIVES 77 stuff was declared misbranded in November 1933 under the National Food and Drugs Act because of the fraudulent claims [N. J. 21593] made for it. The court entered judgment of coniiemnation and forfeiture and ordered the United States marshal to destroy the shipment. Peerless Crystals.-This nostrum was labeled to convey the impression that it was obtained by evaporation from the waters at Mineral Wells, Texas, but when the federal chemists analyzed it they found that its composition differed from that of the minerals obtained from such water and also differed from the analysis printed on the label. The chief ingredient, as might have been expected, was found to be \"horse salts\" (sodium sulfate), with a small pro portion of table salt and epsom salt. Claims made for the curative value of the preparation were declared false and fraudulent [N. J. 22958] and in August 1934 the court ordered that the product be destroyed. Texas Mineral Crystals,-This was another of the horse-salts \"patent medicines\" for, accord ing to the chemists of the Food and Drug Administration, it consisted essentially of crystallized sodium sulfate, with small proportions of epsom salt and table salt. It was marketed by the Dollar Crystal Company of Omaha. Texas Mineral Crystals was declared misbranded by the federal authorities because of false and fraudulent curative claims made for it. In August 1933 the Dollar Crystal Company admitted the government's charges and a decree of condem nation was entered [N. J. 21559] against the product. The court ordered that the product be destroyed. Warm Springs Crystal Compound.-This was labeled so as to lead the public to believe that it consisted of the minerals obtained by evaporating water from Warm Springs, Ga., but analysis showed that it had not been produced from such water. It consisted essentially of Glauber'a salt and the product was declared misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act [N. J. 22613] both because of the falsehoods regarding the composition and the fraud regarding its alleged curative effect. Various seizures of the nostrum in April, June and September 1934 came before the courts and the product was ordered destroyed. Wonder Crystals.-This \"patent medicine,'' which was proved misbranded by the federal authorities, was reported by federal chemists to consist essentially of crystallized sodium sulfate (Glauber'.s salt, or \"horse salts\"). It was marketed by the Wonder Crystal Product Company of Holdrege, Neb., and was recommended as a remedy for chronic constipation, Bright's disease, indigestion, chronic gallbladder disturbance, pyelitis, cystitis, diabetes and various other conditions. These claims were declared fraudulent and in August 1933 judgment of condemnation and forfeiture was entered [N. J. 21237] and the court ordered that the product be destroyed.-(Condeu.red from Hygeia, July 1935, with additions.) MAIL ORDER CONCERNS In the study of the medical mail-order business, one or two things stand out above all others. First, there is usually an unholy alliance between these quacks and some advertising agency. Not infrequently men who start out as advertising agents and solicit the accounts of medical mail-order concerns have themselves gone into the medical mail-order business. For advertising men well know that in exploiting medicines on the mail-order plan, no knowledge of medicine or pharmacy is necessary; the only knowledge requisite to success is that of writing plausible \"come-on\" literature. The medicaments are the least important factor in the business. They can always be purchased from pharmaceutical houses that are not above sharing the profits in this form of charlatanry. Some pharmaceutical houses, in fact, will furnish \"formulas\" for any given group of conditions in which the mail-order quack wishes to \"specialize.\" Another point that stands out is that the newspapers and magazines that accept the advertising of fraudulent medical mail-order concerns get about one-half of the gross profits of the businesses. In other words, the publications make more money out of this form of swindling than do the mail-order quacks themselves. And under our present inadequate laws it is a perfectly safe game. The medical mail-order quack may be, although he seldom is, sent to the penitentiary for his swindles. The newspapers and magazines which have furnished the contact between the swindler and the sick, which have made it possible for the quack to defraud the public and which have made more money out of this business than the quack himself, go unscathed I The products or concerns dealt with in this chapter could, with equal logic, be arranged or be published in chapters dealing with certain group products classified according to the diseases for which the preparations were recommended. As has been stated elsewhere, the classifications used in this book are purely arbitrary and this chapter on mail-order concerns was so listed because it seemed desirable to emphasize, first, the dangers to the public's health, to say nothing of the public's pocketbook, in those forms of quackery which use the United States mails ; and, second, to call attention to the valuable work that is done by an under\u00ad staffed Post Office Department in its attempt to protect the public against this form of swindling. It should be borne in mind in this connection that medical mail-order frauds are merely one group with which the overworked Post Office Department deals. The authorities have to cover the entire field of mail-order fraud. It is also worthy of note that the postal authorities under the law cannot go out and attack mail-order frauds until some complaint has been made by a person who thinks he has been defrauded. Advisory Service Bureau.-This concern operated from the same address and under the same management as the Science Publishing Company, George R Douglass, Medical Aid Bureau, and Medico Electro Company, referred to else\u00ad where. The Advisory Service Bureau put out a line of nostrums : Aphrodisiacs for men and women called, respectively, \"Polyglandol\" and \"Polyglandine\" ; an alleged rheumatism cure, \"Rheuma-RX\"; \"Norgol that were said to build as a \"chocolate candy laxative\"; that were be \"wonderfully effective\" and MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 79 \"Pelvo-Tone\" which was said to make \"life again worth living\" for women. Polyglandol and Polyglandine were analyzed in the A. M.A. Chemical Laboratory. Polyglandol was found to contain animal tissue. phosphorus, yohimbine, a trace of a gold compound and chalk and sugar. Polyglandine was found to contain animal and vegetable tissue, cornstarch, chalk and a binder. It seems likely that the composition of Polyglandol, like that of many \"patent medicines,\" was not always the same. A physician reported that an old gentleman in Springfield, Mass. sent for some Polyglandol and that it was delivered by the postman through the letter\u00ad slot in his door. A valuable English bull terrier got hold of and chewed up the Polyglandol, but, instead of being filled with pep and libido, he turned up his toes and went to his reward. The contents of the dog's stomach were tested and over 2\u00be grains of arsenic were reported found in the stomacb and upper intestines with evident traces of the same poison in the kidneys.-(Condensed from The Journa.Z A. M.A., Sept. 13, 1930.) Allen's Goiter Treatment.-This was known as \"Dr. C. J. Allen's Goiter Treatment'' and was exploited from Sheffield, Iowa by the Allen Remedy Com\u00ad pany. Business was drummed up by means of agents and traveling representatives. C. J. Allen whose name was used in connection with this piece of quackery had been dead for some years at the time that the stuff was exploited. The advertising matter stated that Dr. AJlen had been a \"goiter specialist'' who was \"recognized as such by many leading medical authorities.\" This statement was unqualifiedly false. The \"treatment\" consisted of sixteen four-ounce bottles of a reddish-brown, syrupy liquid having an odor of sassafras and wintergreen. A charge of $90 was made for the sixteen bottles. Purchasers were told to take a teaspoonful with water after each meal. They were also especially instructed to \"massage the goiter both morning and evening\" and in black-faced type were told that \"This is Very Important.\" In the advertising material, a testimonial was printed under the title \"Doctor Recommends Treatment.\" The facts were that the doctor was an employee of the Allen Remedy Company who, according to the records of the A. M.A., had been previously engaged in itinerant quackery. A specimen of Allen's Goiter Treatment was submitted to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory for analysis. No information was given by the manufacturers concerning the composition of the preparation except that the presence of 4 per cent of alcohol was declared. The chemists reported that following their investigation they concluded that Allen's Goiter Treatment consisted essentially of iron (ferrous) iodide and hydriodic acid in a colored and flavored syrup. The serious feature of the business was the viciousness of the indiscriminate sale of an iodide mixture to those who might be and were likely to be suffering from exophthalmic goiter. Added to this was the pernicious suggestion that the victim should massage the thyroid daily. No wonder that physicians reported serious results from the use of this preparation.-(Con\u00ad densed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 24, 1923.) American Cross Chemical Company.-This was one of the trade names used by W. H. Paxton of Birmingham, Ala. in the sale of his nostrums. Other names used were Pax American Cross Chemical Company and American Cross Bearers. W. H. Paxton was a negro, sixty years of age, who for some years sold two nostrums, \"Pax 2 New Life Savers Compound Syrup of Fruit Juices\" and \"Pax 3-in-1 Healing Antiseptic and Liniment.\" When the government inspectors began looking into Paxton's quackery, Paxton gave a list of what he claimed were the ingredients used by him in making the preparations. The so-called New Life Saver Tonic was said to consist of a mixture of pineapple syrup, vanilla extract, extract of blackberries, glycerin and fluid extract of juniper berries. Paxton's \"Healing Antiseptic and Liniment\" was said to contain glycerin, fluid extract of pokeroot, oil of lavender flowers, oil of juniper berries, oil of sassafras and fluid 80 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS extract of blackberry. The two nostrums were usually sold together as one \"treatment\" at a price\u00b7 of $2.50 and Paxton disposed of about 24,000 bottles yearly. Paxton's only knowledge of medicine was what he had obtained when he had been employed as a servant in the house of a physician. 'As a further part of Paxton's scheme in the sale of liis preparations, he solicited fees for membership in what he called the American Cross Bearers. The membership fee was $2. Part of the advertising claptrap of the American Cross Bearers was a booklet in which Paxton set forth what he called rules and regulations governing its members and referring to a number of serious diseases and ailments which he stated could be overcome by certain rules and practices to be followed by the members. In all instances, however, members were expected to keep themselves in health by means of the Paxton preparations. On July 19, 1929, a fraud order was issued against the American Cross Chemical Company, American Cross Bearers and some of the other names used by Paxton in the exploitation of his frauds.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 7, 1929.) Amosol.-In January, 1926 the Post Office Department declared that the concern known as the Strong Laboratories of Liberty, Mo. was engaged in co~\u00ad ducting a fraudulent scheme through the mails and issued a fraud order against it. Strong Laboratories was a trade name used by Henry Strong Smith and his wife. The name was adopted by Mrs. Smith who started the business in 1922 in Chicago. Later the concern was moved to Kansas City, Mo. and still later to Liberty, Mo., about thirteen miles from Kansas City. Amosol was an alleged cure for pyorrhea. It was described in the advertising as a \"miracle,\" a \"new scientific discovery\" that \"kills pyorrhea germs and heals gums quickly.\" Victims were reached, of course, by advertising. Some advertising was done in newspapers, but the bulk of the business was secured by sending out postcards addressed to individuals on \"sucker lists.\" Those who answered the advertisements or post\u00ad cards received form letters telling them that Amosol was a \"great scientific dis\u00ad covery,'' the \"result of years of study and research\"-statements which the Smiths knew were false and fraudulent. During the height of exploitation, the Smiths received about five hundred letters a ciay and took in $4,000 a month. The postal authorities submitted speciments of Amosol to the Bureau of Chemistry, which reported that it was an ordinary cresol emulsion such as is used as a disinfectant for killing lice, ticks, etc. The chemists showed further that while the mixture in sufficient concentration was a germicide it could not be kept in the mouth in such concentration sufficiently long to kill any material number of bacteria. In the Arnosol advertising matter a \"Dr. Strong\" was referred to. There was no such person connected with the business. Some of the form letters sent to prospec\u00ad tive victims of Amosol were signed \"L. Foree Nourse.\" This, it seems, was Mrs. Smith's maiden name and was used rather than the name Smith because they thought it more \"classy.\" The Strong Laboratories were not laboratories and employed no physicians, chemists or pharmacists.-(Comle11sed from The Journal A. M. A., Jan. 30, 1926.) Joseph Askins.-This man quacked it for several years. He would send out letters to ministers, secretaries of chambers of commerce, chairmen of state senates and others, declaring that he had a cure for cancer, tuberculosis, Bright's disease, diabetes and other conditions. He gave as references certain Lima, Ohio ministers and also reproduced in facsimile a testimonial signed by the president and on the stationery of a Lima bank. While Askins did business mainly under his own name, he also used the trade name \"J. A. Company.\" In 1928 Askins was cir\u00ad cularizing ministers and addressing them as \"Dear Sir and Brother Worker in Christ.\" Askins told the preachers that he would treat them and their families free and asked them to send him the names and addresses of persons afflicted with MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 81 cancer, Bright's disease, diabetes and tuberculosis. Askins sold what he called his \"Vitality Batteries\" or \"Heart Batteries.\" They consisted of two locket\u00ad like devices each about the size of a watch. One of these was described by Askins as a zinc or \"negative\" battery and the other as a copper or \"positive\" battery. These so~called batteries were sold by Askins for $5 a set. They were made for him by a concern in Lima at a cost of about 40 cents a set. Askins also put out what he called a \"Vitalizer\" which was not unlike a medium-sized flashlight, except that instead of a light bulb at one end there was a wire cord about a yard long at the far end of which there was fastened a piece of metal about six inches long and a little larger than an ordinary lead pencil. The so-called Vitalizer carried a small dry cell of one and one-half volt capacity. In use, the metal, pencil-like device was inserted into the rectum and the current turned on. Askins' theory was that the body was then flooded with electricity. The Vitalizer was made for him by a St. Louis concern at a cost of $5 each. He sold them at $25 each and was filling about four orders a day. Askins had no medical training and employed no one who had had medical training. On June 21, 1929 a fraud order was issued against th~ J. A. Company but not, unfortunately, against the personal name of Joseph Askins. -(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 14, 1929.) G. R. Bigler.-This man sold through the mails a preparation called \"Bigler's Guaranteed Prostate Treatment\" for the alleged relief and cure of \"prostate trouble.\" Bigler was not, nor did he employ, a physician, chemist or pharmacist. He secured business through advertisements placed in periodicals and magazines. Those who answered such advertisements received a form letter from Bigler in which they were urged to \"act at once and get Bigler's Guaranteed Prostate Treatment on our liberal money-back guarantee that you must get satisfactory results and relief.\" The treatment was said to be different from other \"home treatments\" and consisted in applying \"a positive treatment directly to the prostate.\" It was said to be \"a valuable ointment\" that, if given by a physician, \"would probably cost ten times as much.\" The \"home treatment\" consisted of the oint\u00ad ment and some tablets and three finger cots to be used in applying the ointment. The \"treatment\" was sold for $4.85. When analyzed by the government chemists, the ointment was found to be a simple mixture of petrolatum and wax. The tablets were hexamethylenamine. While Bigler promised to refund all remittances to those who did not get \"satisfactory results\" after using the treatment for thirty days, as a matter of fact he refused to make such refunds in many instances, due to the fact that purchasers had not written him every five days for the purpose of keeping him informed as to any alleged progress. Investigation also disclosed that in some instances, instead of affording relief, the Bigler treat\u00adment actually increased the symptoms and caused the user greater pain. In such cases, if the user discontinued the treatment, he was automatically deprived of any opportunity, under the terms of the guarantee, to obtain a refund. In view of the facts developed by the postal authorities following an investigation of Bigler's \u00b7 quackery, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order on November 21, 1934 closing the mails to G. R. Bigler, Bigler's Prostate Treatment, Bigler's Guaranteed Prostate Treatment and Bigler Company.-(Condensecl from The Joi,rnal A. M.A., March 16, 1935.) Bono Drug Company.-Maurice Lundin conducted a concern that he called the Bono Drug Company (and also Bono Company) in New York City and Jersey City, N. J. Under another name, Lundin, according to the federal authorities, also engaged in marketing a small pneumatic ring called the \"Poten\u00ad tor\" for the cure of impotence. The sale of this device was the basis of a fraud order in 1928. Under still another name, Lundin sold through the mails a device called the \"Saddle,\" also sold as a cure for impotence; this was held obscene by 82 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS the postal authorities. Lundin's Bono Drug Company sold three products: (1) \"French Pep Tablets\" said to be a cure for impotence, sexual debility, inflammation and enlargement of the prostate, \"kidney trouble,\" \"bladder trouble,\" etc. ; (2) \"French Pomade\" which was a supplementary treatment to be used with the French Pep Tablets, and (3) \"Bonol Balsam\" which was supposed to grow hair on bald heads I The French Pep Tablets were small red disks containing extract of damiana, asafetida, some bromides, aloin and zinc phosphide. They were to be taken internally. The French Pomade was a petrolatum mixture containing some red pepper and menthol scented with citronella. It was supposed to be applied locally. Bonol Balsam was another petrolatum mixture with some salicylic acid and precipitated sulfur. It was to be rubbed on bald heads. Lundin obtained his victims by purchasing \"sucker lists\" from concerns that deal in those commodities. After analyzing these various preparations and giving careful consideration to the claims made for them, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order against the Bono Drug Company and to the Bono Company on December 26, 1929.-Con\u00ad densed from The Journal A. M.A., Jan. 18, 1930.) Brown's New Consumption Remedy.-D. H. Brown of Jacksonville and St. Augustine, Fla. was a negro who, under the trade name of Brown's Magnolia Remedy Company, sold an alleged consumption cure on the mail-order plan. He made his appeal especially to those unfortunate members of his own race who were afflicted with tuberculosis. As long ago as November, 1916 the federal authorities got after Brown under the Federal Food and Drugs Act, charging that his prepara\u00ad tion was fraudulent. In December 1917 Brown pleaded guilty and was fined. Following this brush with Food and Drugs officials, Brown ceased making his lying and fraudulent claims on the trade packages but continued making them in newspaper advertisements and in circulars. A few years later the postal authorities took up Brown's case. They analyzed his nostrum and found that part of the ingredients were creosote and maltose and they proved that the claim that this stuff would cure tuberculosis was fraudulent. As a result, on February 2, 1923 the mails were closed to D. H. Brown and the Magnolia Remedy Company.-(Con\u00ad densed from The Journal A. M.A., Feb. 17, 1923.) Emile Carpentier.-This person sold a preparation, alleged to have been discovered by himself, under the claim that it would cure all forms of tuberculosis as well as ulcers of the stomach, duodenum and intestines. Carpentier used to advertise in periodicals published in the vicinity of sanatoria devoted to the treat\u00adment of tuberculosis. Those who answered Carpentier's advertisements received a letter from him in which he claimed that he could not specify any fixed time in which he could produce a cure, but that he had \"cured hasty consumption in seven weeks.\" In other circulars Carpentier claimed that his 11Compound\" dissolved the wall (waxy envelope?) surrounding the tubercle bacillus \"the same as boiling water dissolves sugar.\" Carpentier's preparation, described as his \"Compound of Oriental Herbs,\" was a greasy, ill-smelling paste that came in small jars of about two-ounce capacity. The government chemists reported that analysis showed it to be composed essentially of animal fat, or grease, with honey and a small amount of gentian root. It was prepared by Carpentier with the assistance of his wife in their kitchen, using ordinary pots and pans and an egg-beater for mixing. Although Carpentier was not a physician, he used the title \"Dr.\" before his name and \"N. D.\" after his name. He advised the government that the use of the initials \"N. D.\" after his name was based on a \"Certificate of Membership\" purchased by him in June, 1932 from the \"American Naturopathic Association\" for which he paid $15. He took no course of study to secure this \"certificate.\" In October, 1929 Carpentier had been convicted of violating the Medical Practice Act of New Jersey and was fined $200. Carpentier insisted that his motives in selling MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 83 his preparation were purely humanitarian and \"not for the purpose of making money.\" It was shown that the jar of his stuff that sold for $7 cost him about 50 cents. Following the investigation and hearing by the postal authorities, the Postmaster General on April 25, 1933 closed the mails to Emile Carpentier.\u00ad (Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 2, 1933.) Chinese Herb Company.-This was said to have been operated by one Lou Wing who also used the name Lau Yit Cho. Wing sold \"herb treatments\" through the mails for the alleged cure of practically all diseases and ailments. He imported the herbs from Shanghai and mixed them himself. His claims for the alleged curative value of the herbs were based on statements of persons who used them. Each \"treatment\" cost $10 regardless of the nature of the disease or its mildness or severity. The treatments consisted of seven separate packages of herbs, roots and barks. The instructions stated that each day the contents of one package were to be boiled with four or five cups of water for about one-half or three-quarters of an hour. The liquid was to be strained and drunk while warm. About the only physiologic effect that these decoctions had was that of producing a bowel move\u00ad ment. The treatments were sold as cures for syphilis, cancer, gonorrhea, valvular heart disease, diabetes and various other conditions. Lou Wing swindled his public by the usual medical mail-order method-that of using certain newspapers. He carried advertisements in about fifteen papers published in English, Italian, Portuguese and Greek. The Postmaster General issued a fraud order against the Chinese Herb Company in July, 1930.-(Comiensed from, The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 6, 1930.) Clark's 0. N. T.-This was an alleged cure for impotence sold by concerns which went under such trade names as the \"Clark Remedy Company,\" \"Clark's 0. N. T .\" and \"Nate Clark.\" In addition, the trade names \"Madge Laboratory\" and \"C. C. Nathan\" were also used in exploiting a similar product, \"Old Madge's Vita,\" for the same purposes as \"Clark's 0. N. T.\" Prospective victims were obtained through concerns that make a business of renting and selling \"sucker lists.\" The product, whether sold under the name of Old Madge's Vita or Clark's 0. N. T., was a cold cream colored pink and perfumed and containing red pepper. The stuff was supposed to be applied locally. The place of business of the Clark Remedy Company consisted of one room with a small side-chamber used as an office. No physicians, chemists or pharmacists were employed, but six women who attended to the mail business constituted the force. These concerns did an annual business of approximately $28,000. The box of salve constituting Clark's 0. N. T. and Old Madge's Vita sold for $2; it cost approximately five cents to manufacture. On May 7, 1929 the mails were closed to the Clark Remedy Com\u00ad pany, Clark's 0. N. T., Nate Clark, Madge Laboratory, Madge's Vita 'and C. C. Nathan.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M. A., May 25, 1929.) Clearo.-This was a \"patent medicine\" sold on the mail-order plan under the trade name \"Clearo Company.\" The exploiter claimed that when a young man he was afflicted with tuberculosis and was cured by a simple herb medicine prepared by the Choctaw Indians. He claimed to have discovered what this herb was and how it was prepared and to have greatly improved the preparation. In the adver\u00ad tising matter consisting of booklets, pamphlets and circulars, Clearo was held out as a cure for tuberculosis, asthma, bronchitis, hay fever and serious throat and lung troubles. Of course, the composition of Clearo was kept secret and the whole tenor of the representations made with respect to it was calculated to deceive persons into believing that Clearo had some mysterious virtues not possessed by other known drugs. When Clearo was analyzed by the federal chemists acting for the postal authorities, the stuff was found to be an anioer-colored, bitter liquid containing over 98 per cent of water and alcohol with traces of tannin and bitter 84 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS plant principles. Investigation proved that the thing was totally worthless as a cure for tuberculosis and a fraud order was issued against the Clearo Company July 8, 1922.-(Condensed from The /01,rnal A. M.A., Oct. 21, 1922.) H. P. Clearwater.-This man for years conducted various mail-order quack\u00ad eries. He had a somewhat extensive line of nostrums, some of which were sold exclusively on the mail-order plan, while in the sale of others Clearwater split profits with drug stores. His line power; \"Cardex\" for the heart; \"Kidney enox\" Clearwater's methods of doing business were not original-in fact, a study of mail-order quackery convinces one that originality in this field is unnecessary. Those who would treat themselves with medicines about which they know nothing, sent out by persons about whom they know less, are easily caught by the conventional followups that are the stock-in-trade of the medical mail-order faker. To make his contact it was necessary for Clearwater to advertise in those cheap magazines that act as a \"go-between\" in bringing the mail-order quack and his victim together. Clearwater usually advertised his \"Rheumatic Treatment\" probably because he could get those advertisements accepted more easily than those, for instance, of his \"cure\" for heart disease. Many who answered his \"rheumatism cure\" advertisements, however, received, before Clearwater got through with them, persuasive advertising urging them to buy one or more of the other nostrums that he had for sale. Some years ago Clearwater was running, as side lines, two other mail-order fakes called, respectively, the \"Heart Cure Company\" and the \"Associated Specialists.\" The form letters which were sent out to those who answered these advertisements were signed \"Directing Specialist Clearwater.\" One \"complete 45 days treatment'' (price $5) of Clearwater's rheumatism nostrum was ordered and the material turned over to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory. The chemists reported that \"Clearwater's Scientific Rheumatic Treatment\" consisted of two boxes of tablets of different colors. The tablets in one of the boxes were found to contain essentially sodium iodide and washing soda, while the tablets in the other box contained a laxative with some added bitters, probably gentian.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M. A., Dec. 18, 1926.) W. O. Coffee Company.-This concern and its officers were debarred from the use of the United States mails on June 6, 1935 because the postal authorities declared that their business was \"a scheme for obtaining money through the mails by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises.\" The history of this concern is an interesting example of twentieth-century quackery. William 0. Coffee, the originator, died in 1927, but for many years was a mail\u00ad order quack. He claimed a diploma from the Missouri Medical College, 1881. From Des Moines, Ia., he advertised a mail-order \"eye-cure\" business. His activities were exposed by Samuel Hopkins Adams in C oilier' s \"Great American Fraud\" series and a few years later Coffee filed a petition in voluntary bankruptcy. Then Coffee for some time carried on an itinerant practice, visiting various towns a day or two at a time. In 1918 he moved to Davenport, Ia., in which town he again went into mail-order quackery exploiting a mail-order \"deafness cure.\" The business was much too profitable to be permitted to die with him and after his death it was carried on by his son, P. E. Coffee. The records of the A. M. A. showed that: (1) Percy E. Coffee held a diploma issued in 1903 by a homeo\u00ad pathic school ; (2) he was never licensed to practice medicine in any state in the Union; and (3) he had in fact admitted that he was \"not in practice.\" His experience in the treatment\u00b7 of deafness was obviously confined to selling pills and ----~ \u00b7------- MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 85 potions to people he never saw. The postal authorities brought out the fact that P. E. Coffee had been spending about $8,000 a year for advertising. Formerly, when the fraud was in a more flourishing condition, the advertising bills alone ran as high as $190,000 a year I The company also circularized lists of names of supposed sufferers from deafness and catarrh (\"sucker lists\") purchased from letter brokers. P. E. Coffee sent out so-called diagnosis blanks and stated in his circular letters that if he thought the treatment would help the patient he would send it, but that if he thought it wouldn't help the patient he would tell him so. Yet he admitted at the Postoffice hearing that he was unable to diagnose any case from the answers on the diagnosis blank; he admitted, also, that he was WANTED! 15,800 SUFFERERS. FROM .

The so-called thirty-day treatment sent out by P. E. Coffee consisted of (1) a powder that was to be dissolved and the solution used as a nasal douche; (2) another powder also to be dissolved and used as a gargle; (3) an inhalant that was to be taken through the nostrils and which contained oils of mustard, eucalyptus and peppermint in mineral oil ; ( 4) another oil, two or three drops of which were to be placed on absorbent cotton and the cotton placed in the external ear; (5) a salve to be inserted up the nose and consisting essentially of petrolatum with small quantities of eucalyptus, peppermint and wintergreen oils; (6) another oint\u00ad ment, also mainly petrolatum, containing a small quantity of red pepper, to be applied behind the ears and (7) some laxative tabl~ts which contained aloin, 86 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS cascara and podophyllin. The evidence developed during the hearing showed that two women who had been with the W. 0. Coffee Company for many years were the ones who examined the \"symptom blanks\" and filled the orders. They did not even consult P. E. Coff cc unless they were in doubt as to whether to send the treatment I P. E. Coffee admitted that it was impossible to diagnose the cases from the symptom blanks ; he admitted also that even if the patient were present he wasn't competent to diagnose his case and, finally, it was brought out that he didn't even try to diagnose most cases, but left it to the two women with no medical training who furnished the various \"treatmentsl\"-(Condensed frotn The Joumal A. M. A., Aug. 10, 1935.) Crown Medicine Company.-This was a mail-order fraud operated from Atlanta, Ga. On the basis of the facts developed by the Post Office Department, on May 5, 1931 a fraud order was issued debarring the Crown Medicine Company and its officers from the use of the United States mails. The Crown Medicine Company was a trade name used by one Thomas Reed. The business was founded in October, 1919 and for years Reed sold a preparation called Crown Treatment, representing that when used as directed the preparation would cure pellagra in a short time, regardless of the duration of the disease. Business was obtained by means of advertisements and circular matter sent through the mails. Reed's adver\u00ad tising matter: had the usual number of testimonials in which individuals were quoted as stating that they would have been dead but for the Crown Treatment; ~~~~~~b~~~~~~~~~~ results in two weeks. Reed was said to have informed the postal authorities that the formula for the Crown Treatment was secured from a doctor in Tampa, Fla. Reed further admitted that the treatment was actually nothing more or less than a treatment for syphilis, the ingredients, according to Reed, being potassium iodide, sarsaparilla extract, essence of pepsin and coloring matter. When the Crown Treatment was analyzed by the federal chemists, however, they found it to be a mixture of potassium iodide and mercuric chloride with a small amount of iron sulphate and aromatic material. The offices of the Crown Medicine Company consisted of two rooms, one of which was subdivided by a partition into an office and \"laboratory ;\" the other was used for packing purposes. The only equipment of the \"laboratory\" was a large crockery mixer resembling an inverted jug suspended above a table. The Crown Treatment was prepared in this mixer and was then withdrawn into bottles through a spigot at the bottom. Thomas Recd was not a physician, chemist or pharmacist. Yet, in spite of this, test correspondence con\u00ad ducted by the government showed that Reed undertook the diagnosis of symptoms and, in some cases, sold his preparation on the basis of symptoms that did not indicate pellagra.-(Co11dcnscd from The Journal A. M. A., June 13, 1931.) George R. Dougfass.-Under this name, the persons operating the Science Publishing Company, the Advisory Service Bureau, the Medical Aid Bureau, etc., advertised an aphrodisiac called \"Glantone.\" The advertisement stated that Doug\u00ad less was a pharmaceutical chemist and that a few years ago he found that he was losing his sexual vigor. One day a \"pale, elderly man\" handed him a prescription that had been written by an \"eminent gland specialist.\" Douglass filled it and claimed that in a week's time, when the man came back to have it refilled, the patient looked much better. He therefore studied the prescription, improved on it and prepared one for his own use. The alleged result is best quoted in Douglass' own words: \"Well sir, no man could have been more surprised than I was when, a few weeks later, I found myself stepping around about as spry as ever, taking a renewed interest in my work, full of pep and a return of manly vigor that made me feel as frisky as a young colt let out on green pasture. No longer did I experience a feeling of shame at going home after the day's work was done and meeting the look of half pity, half reproach in my wife's eyes.\" MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 87 All of this leading up to the exploitation of \"Glantone.\" This, like Goldglan put out by the Medical Aid Bureau, came in two forms-for men and women, respectively.-(Conden.red from The Journal A.

These pieces of metal were crudely cut by an Atlanta tinner from sheets of copper and zinc. They cost 25 cents a pair; they were sold at $5 a pair l It was claimed that when worn in the shoes the plates would cure hardening of the arteries, high blood pressure, enlarge\u00ad ment of the heart, kidney trouble, hardening of the prostate gland, diabetes, rheumatism and dropsy l Business was obtained through advertisements and cir\u00adculars sent through the mails and distributed personally by members of the Hughes family and agents. According to the Hughes thesis, the various diseases and ailments in which the use of the plates was claimed to effect a cure are caused by uric acid in the bloodstream. It was represented that the plates would cause the blood of the person wearing them to be heated about two degrees and that this increased temperature caused uric acid to be dissolved, thus eliminating the disease l \"Elemental, my dear Watson l\" On January 16, 1930, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order against the Electrifiable Company and J. M. Hughes.\u00ad (Conde-nsed from The Journal A. M.A., 100. PUGILITIB-PENDICITIS Fisheropathic College Association.-This was a name applied to a mail\u00ad order quack concern having for its president and treasurer George B. Fisher, for its vice-president Richard B. Fisher, son of George B., and for its secretary Anna L. Fisher, sister of George B. In 1911 Denver newspapers reported that George B. Fisher had been found guilty in the federal courts of sending obscene matter through the mails to the \"wives of two prominent Denver business men.\" It was reported at the time that the judge before whom Fisher was tried gave the quack a scathing arraignment, stating that \"a man who was guilty of the practices of which Fisher had been convicted was of the lowest species of humanity and not fit to mingle with decent and respectable people.\" Papiers at the same time reported that prior to this conviction Fisher had been charged with defrauding an aged and infirm woman out of $15,000 in notes and securities. A suit against him in the District Court, according to the same report, resulted in these notes and securities being restored to the woman. In 1923 the Department of Agriculture declared Fisher's nostrums (\"Uterine Tonic\" and \"Kidney Food\") misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act. The federal authorities declared the Uterine Tonic misbranded because it was fraudulently represented as an effective cure for \"lack of passion.'' absence of menstrual flow, cancer of the uterus, gonorrhea and various other conditions. George B. Fisher claimed to be the \"only diagnostician in the world making a chemical and psychological diagnosis.\" A young woman, unmarried but pregnant, got in touch with Fisher 88 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS some years ago and Fisher diagnosed her case as one of uinfantile womb, malnu\u00ad trition, catarrh of stomach, and retroversion.\" He said that the ubloating\" was due to the conditions mentioned and added that the case usuggests a dropsical inclination.\" He urged her to \"lose no time in ordering the $10 Fisheropathic Home Special.\" The Fisher group put out a number of preparations. \"Pugilitis\u00ad Pendicitis\" was mainly epsom salt with a small amount of baking soda, some citric acid and table salt dissolved in fruit juices flavored with extract of pepper\u00ad mint. The experts for the government testified that this laxative, if given in some cases of acute attacks of appendicitis, would be about as dangerous as could be\u00b7 conceived. \"Digestive Gems\" were composed of senna, red pepper, table salt, powdered charcoal, glycerin and oil of peppermint. \"Columbine Massage Cream,\" it was claimed, would develop the bust, remove wrinkles and freckles, cure eczema, ringworm, prickly heat and shingles, while if taken internally it would cure pneu\u00ad monia, influenza, whooping cough and asthma I The federal chemists found that the stuff was made of mineral oil, white wax and paraffin. Fisher's \"Sanitary Suppositories\" were said to require neither douche nor enema and could be used by men, women and children. They were recommended for rectal or vaginal cancer, blood poisoning, fistulas, inflammation of the colon, prostate and bladder and for various other conditions. The composition of this therapeutic wonder was found by the federal chemists to be our old friend epsom salt put up in gelatin capsules. The \"Dyscrasia Remedy\" was said to contain echinacea. The \"Gastric Assimilator'' was an alcohol-water solution of sugar, fruit juices, citric acid and oil of peppermint. Fisher's \"Uterine Tonic Knowledge,\" advertised as a \"scientific oxygenator and tissue builder,\" was composed of ammonium iodide, a carbonate, glycerin, formaldehyde and spirits of cloves. This was offered as a \"perfect deodorant in blood poisoning\" and for uterine cancer. On September 26, 1933, the mails were closed to this fraud.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Oct. 28, 1933.) The Galvano N ecklace.-This was described as \"the latest discovery for the relief or cure of goiter by mild electrical treatment\" and was advertised by the Cosmas Pharmacal Company. It appeared that for all practical purposes the Cosmas Pharmacal Company was one Dr. Frederick C. Werner who was not only the president, manager, director and consulting physician for the company but was also described as the inventor of the \"Galvano Necklace\" which was the device that the company sold. Those who answered the Cosmas Pharmacal Company's advertisements received a letter signed \"F. C. Werner, M.D., Consulting Physician,\" stating that the letter had been referred to Werner by the company. One might visualize Pooh-Bah Werner receiving a letter in his capacity of president and Manager of the company and gravely referring the letter to himself in his capacity of \"Consulting Physician.\" Part of the Werner advertising was a booklet contain\u00ad ing on the. outside cover a highly imaginary picture of the Galvano Necklace. From part of the necklace, there emanated what at first sight seemed to be cats' whiskers, but which were supposed to represent electrical radiations. The Galvano Necklace was-to the disgrace of the United States Patent Office, be it said-granted a patent in July, 1916. The necklace itself was a cheap and tawdry-looking affair of greenish-yellow and terracotta colored beads strung on a piece of wire. The part of the necklace which would fall over the front of the neck consisted of a double row of beads and between the beads in this part of the necklace there were placed, alternately, small discs of zinc and copper. There came with each Galvano Necklace a small jar of ointment containing mercurous iodide and chloride of lime. In use, the ointment was applied to the skin of the neck and the necklace then hung so that the double part containing the zinc and copper discs would come in contact with the anointed skin. When this device was first put on the market, Werner charged $3.50 for it. Then in 1916 the price was raised to $5.00 and in -----\u00b7\u00b7 -------------1 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS s9 I 1917 it was $7.50. As an adornment it would fail to find a purchaser if offered in competition with the \"jewelry\" of the Five-and-Ten-Cent stores; as a therapeutic device it ranked with a string of wampum. Werner died in 1924, but the business was carried on by certain members of his family. Finally in 1930 the Post Office Department notified the Cosmas Pharmacal Company to show cause why a fraud order should not be issued against it. A hearing was held that brought out little that has not already been mentioned, except the fact that the Galvano Necklace, when carefully tested in the United States Bureau of Standards with an electrical device so sensitive as to record an electric current of one-ten millionth of an ampere, failed to disclose any electric current l On August 14, 1930, the R~st Office Department-another branch of the same government that had in 1916 issued a patent on this preposterous piece of hokum on the ground that it was a \"new and useful improvement in appliances for treating goiter\"--declared the F C. WlRNER. APPLIANCE roa TREATING The \"Galvano Necklace\" as illustrated in specifications of Patent No. 1190831 issued by the United States government on an alleged \"new and useful improvement in appliances for treating goiter.\" The same government later declared it a fraud. device worthless and its method of exploitation a fraud, and debarred it from the mails.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Dec. 8, 1923, and Sept. 20, 1930.) German Fruit Salts.-Herman Landgraf of Philadelphia sold through the mails what he variously called \"German Fruit Salts\" or \"Fruit Salts Biological Elektrolyt.\" According to German Fruit Salts were good for what\u00ad ever ailed you. In fact, the nostrum was exploited so crudely that it seemed likely that Landgraf was more ignoramus than swindler. sodium tartrate and sodium citrate, more than 60 per cent being made up of the Glauber's salts and sodium phosphate-substances that by no stretch of imagination could be called salts derived from fruits. Landgraf in his advertising listed alphabetically some of. the disease states for which his salts were recommended. The alphabetical list was a noble one, starting with \"A\" (Apoplexy) and ending with \"Y\" (Yellow jaundice). It was apparently of no value in treating diseases beginning with \"X\" or \"Z.\" On July 30, 1934, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order debarring Landgraf from the use of the United States mails. Subsequently, a physician in a I I \u00b7I 90 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS smaII town in Pennsylvania reported that Landgraf had come to his town and had put up a sign to the effect that the Hilton Chemical Company of Philadelphia had a remedy for diabetes and a new system of medicine from Europe that would relieve any disease.-(Condeused from The Journal A. M.A., Oct. 27, 1934.) The Height-Increasing Fraud.-Clara Louisa Glover and \"Bernard Bernard\" (the name, according to the federal authorities, was Trappschuh) were engaged in exploiting a device for the alleged purpose of increasing the height of those who desired to be -taller. Nerther Glover nor Trappschuh was a physician. Trappschuh, in fact, under the name \"Bernard Bernard,\" published books on sex subjects and fad diets. The postal authorities called on these people to show cause why a fraud order should not be issued against \"L. Glover, Specialist,\" which was the trade name under which this fake was exploited. Glover and Trappschuh (\"Bernard\") both appeared at the hearing. Trappschuh claimed to have invented the device, although no mention was made of this fact in the advertising and Trappschuh's name was left out of all adver\u00ad tising connected with the sale of the device. The device itself consisted of two canvas bands sewn together at each end and intended to be placed about the head of the user in the manner of a halter. There were pieces of sash cord for suspend\u00ad ing the canvas bands from an overhead beam. There were also two hand grips, likewise to be suspended from overhead by means of two screwhooks. The device permitted adjustment to a height which would barely enable the user to touch the floor with his feet, thus throwing the weight of the body on the user's neck. The hand grips were for the purpose of relieving the strain upon the neck when it became too severe. The device cost 75 cents to make; it was sold for $8.50. With the sale of the \"halter,\" there were a number of pages of mimeographed matter called \"lessons\" and containing a series of exercises that were to be per\u00adformed either with or without the apparatus. The federal authorities stated that, upon cross-examination, both Miss Glover and Trappschuh (\"Bernard\") showed a marked lack of familiarity with the contents of their own \"lessons I\" Victims were obtained by advertising in magazines. Accompanying the so-called lessons was circular matter advertising books with suggestive sex titles, as well as other books written by Trappschuh (\"Bernard\"), and sold by his concern under the name \"Health and Life Publication\" of Chicago. Within the lessons was the recommendation that the victims purchase \"Bernard Bernard's\" book \"Correct and Corrective Eating.\" Trappschuh himself, the inventor of the device for increasing height and the exploiter of the claim that, by means of his apparatus, one could increase his height approximately a head and a half, was only five feet one I When called on at the government hearing to perform the \"exercises\" descn'bed in his lessons,\" he admitted that he could not do so without constant reference to his own \"instruc\u00ad tions.\" When asked why he had not increased his own stature, his excuse was that he had not had time to take the \"course.\" C. L. Glover was a tall woman of thirty-eight. She stated at the hearing that she had not used the \"course\" nor the device as she had no need for it. It was brought out at the hearing that over $26,000 had been obtained from the public since the inception of the scheme. As a result of the investigation, the Postmaster General on March 23, 1928, closed the mails to \"L. Glover, Specialist\" and \"L. Glover.\" The easy money, however, was too strong a temptation and Glover and Trappschuh transferred their operations to another state. Here they continued advertising the device under the trade name \"Glover Institute\" which operated from the headquarters of Trappschuh's publishing outfit. These facts coming to the attention of the postal authorities, the Post Office Department extended the fraud order in April 1929 so as to cover the name of the Glover Institute at the new address.-(Condensed from The Jou;.,ial A. M. A., July 6, 1929.) MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 91 Glow of Life.-This was a nostrum that was put out by the Glow of Life Laboratories Company of Columbus, Ohio. In March 1933 the Post Office Department sent the company a copy of a memorandum of charges calling upon the company to show cause why a fraud order should not be issued against it. At the time set for the hearing, no one appeared at Washington, but a lawyer for the concern filed a written reply to the memorandum of charges. The Glow of Life Laboratories Company advertised, according to the report of the postal authorities, \"in various publications of a kind which are not particular as to the character of the advertisements which they print, including magazines whose prin\u00ad cipal contents are pictures of nude females and stories of a salacious character.\" Those who answered the advertisements were sent a circular entitled, \"Glow of Life, the Fountain of Youth, A Remedy That Will Help You To Overcome Your Sexual Weaknesses.\" The tablets sold for $1 a package of twenty-four, or about 4 cents a tablet. They consisted, according to the government's report, essentially of nux vomica and zinc phosphide together with chalk and gum. The promoters had claimed that they also contained arsenic, gold, cantharides (Spanish fly) and laxatives. None of these was found. The government presented expert medical evidence to prove that these tablets would not restore \"lost manhood\" or cure sexual impotence or frigidity. It also brought out the fact that the ingredients of Glow of Life Tablets have been incorporated in other preparations sold under similarly fraudulent claims in cases wherein fraud orders have been issued against the promoters of such schemes ; yet, the Glow of Life concern claimed that their product was an original discovery I The Postmaster General issued a fraud order April 26, 1933, closing the mails to the Glow of Life Laboratories Company.\u00ad (Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Aug. 5, 1933.) Haines' Golden Treatment.-This heartless swindle that was operated through the United States mails for over fifty years finally had the mails closed to it on August 26, 1935. The \"Dr. Haines' Golden Treatment\" used to be known as the \"Golden Specific\" before lying on or in the trade package carried with it a risk of prosecution. For over half a century, mothers, wives and sisters were led to believe that they could cure their loved ones of the drink habit by the secret administration of the Haines' Golden Treatment. Never in all this period was a case of drunkenness ever cured by such means. But swindlers who exploit \"liquid cures\" know full well that in the very nature of the case the victims who had been defrauded will never complain because of the publicity that is inseparable from such complaints. The Haines' Golden Treatment was delt with in an article published in Nostrums and Qua-ckery, Volume II. The A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory which analyzed the alleged cure at that time reported that it was essentially a mixture of milk sugar and starch with a small amount of red pepper and a minute amount of ipecac. In November, 1929, the National Better Business Bureau issued a special bulletin to periodical publishers on the Haines' Golden Treatment, pointing out the fraudulent claims made for the product and stating that the exploitation of the Golden Treatment was contrary to the public welfare. In the same year the Federal Trade Commission ordered a com\u00ad plaint against the Dr. J. W. Haines Company because the concern was advertising that its compound would cure a person of the liquor habit without the patient's knowledge. Two years later the Haines concern entered into a stipulation with the Federal Trade Commission to correct and revise its advertising copy, its literature and form-letters so as to eliminate all the objectionable material. Of course, a quackish concern of this type could hardly be expected to keep its word and, in fact, it was still making the fraudulent claim that the Commission had objected to up as late as the time the Post Office Department proceeded against them. The postal authorities had an analysis made of the so-called Golden Treatment an\u00b7d found that it was still made up mainly of milk sugar with varying amounts 92 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS of red pepper and ginger. At the hearing at Washington, the man behind this fraud submitted what he claimed were testimonials for the nostrum from physicians. A perusal of the letters showed that some were from practitioners who were not physicians, but osteopaths, or others having little or no training in the use of drugs and none of the persons apparently was familiar with the formula of the so-called treatment. Still others were evidently from persons anxious to obtain a profit of the resale of the treatment to patients. Two of the alleged physicians whose testimonials were submitted were con\u00a3 essed morphine addicts as well as No Mere Whiskey Drinking Home Treatment That .Costs Notfllag To Try Ododcaend Tadolaa i;~~a1~:i: Toa.Coffeoor Food. ..

M. A., Oct. 26, 1935.) Tom Hayes.-Archie T. Hay, who did business from Chicago under the trade name \"Tom Hayes\", sold on the mail-order plan a salve or ointment called \"T. N. T. (Tom's New Treatment)\" for cases of \"lost manhood.\" Investigation showed that Hay's scheme was practically identical with the fraud known as \"Clark's 0. N. T.\" (which see). The advertising and entire method of exploitation of the two frauds were practically identical. The ointment sold by Hay had a paraffin and cold cream base containing small amounts of zinc oxide, red pepper and strychnine. The substance was supposed to be applied locally, as was the case in Clark's 0. N. T. fraud. Hay denied that his business was a continuation of the Clark Remedy Company but admitted that he had practically copied all of the \"literature\" of that concern, which he obtained from one of the owners of the Clark fraud. Of course, Hay had no medical or pharmaceutical knowledge, nor did he employ any physicians, chemists or pharmacists. His nostrum, according --~----------~ MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 93 to the government report, was prepared for him and he admitted that he did not even know the ingredients of the preparation that he sold. The Postmaster General on February 18, 1930, declared the Tom Hayes business a fraud and debarred it from the mails.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., March 8, 1930.) Heilol (Haelan).-This was first put on the market by the General Remedies Company of Denver under the name \"Haelan\" and was described as a \"guaranteed treatment for tuberculosis.\" The business was started in September 1923 and the concern was advertising in about fifty newspapers covering considerable territory. Practically all of the advertisements \u00b7 featured a man described as \"a prominent Denver physician.\" He was not a \"prominent Denver physician;\" he was an osteopath who, according to the postal authorities, got a commission on every bottle of the nostrum that was sold. The advertising declared that Heilol had been \"developed by scientific research in the laboratories at the Universities of Vienna and Zara\" and had been brought to America \"and submitted to rigid tests among many tubercular patients in Denver.\" These claims also were false. The stuff was originated by an alien from Austria named Marko Gacina who in 1906 peddled his medicine at Seattle. He later went to California, then to Oregon and in 1922 went to Denver where he met osteopath Davis. Gacina had merely sold his stuff as a \"stomach remedy;\" Davis apparently invested it with its alleged virtues as a consumption cure. Heilol was essentially a solution of vegetable extractives in alcohol and water, such herbs as sarsaparilla root, burdock root, poke root, prickly ash bark, senna leaves, slippery elm bark, cascara bark and similar material being used in its manufacture. On November 26, 1924, the Postmaster General closed the mails to the exploiters of Heilol.-(Condcnsed from The Journal A. M. A., Dec. 20, 1924.) Home Products Company and Hormex Company.-These were two names for what was essentially the same business. The concerns were run in Denver by the same individuals who had operated the Heilol consumption cure fakery ( which see). The business of the Home Products Company and the Hormex Company was that of selling through the mails tablets, suppositories, bougies and an ointment for the alleged sexual stimulation of men, and some tablets and special suppositories for the same alleged purpose for women. This nauseatingly filthy piece of quackery was declared a fraud on August 25, 1931, and the mails closed to it. An interesting side-light was thrown on the business by the postal investigation in which it was shown that one of the men who operated these swindles and also the consumption cure fraud was himself in a sanitarium suffering from tuberculosis.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Sept. 19, 1931.) Hazen A. Horton.-This man when about sixty-eight years of age had been engaged in mail-order enterprises for approximately twenty years. For the greater portion of the period, he conducted a matrimonial agency. Following this, he put on the market a preparation called the \"Ox-O External Treatment\" which was sold under the claim that it would cure \"lost manhood,\" prostate trouble, etc. The treatment was another of the ointments containing red pepper that was to be applied locally. The stuff cost him 10 cents a box and was \u00b7sold by him for $2 a box. In February, 1923, Horton was indicted in connection with the Ox-O enterprise and in March of the same year he pleaded guilty and was fined $1,000. He also filed with the postal authorities an affidavit in which he promised absolutely to discontinue and abandon the business and stated further that he would not in the future operate any other business of a like character. His affidavit, however, was as worthless as might have been expected and almost immediately he inaugurated a scheme for the sale of a preparation called \"Horton's Pile Treatment.\" Later still, he again started the sale of a \"treatment\" for impotence. In spite of the fact that Horton claimed in his advertising that his remedies had cured himself of 94 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS various conditions, it was admitted at the hearing by Horton's own representative that Horton himself was a physical wreck. On November 9, 1928, the Post\u00ad master General closed the mails to this quack.-(Co11dc11sed from The Jomnal A. M. A., Dec. 8, 1928.) J. Bernard King.-For some years this man defrauded the public by selling earth as a cure for all the ills of flesh under the claim that it was a radium salt. In August 1918 King who was then quacking it in Cincinnati sent to the author of this book what he described as a \"full size sample of a real tuberculosis cure.\" The stuff apparently was some kind of soil or earth done up in a quilted pad. King declared that it was a \"new radium\" and insisted that while it was strongly radio-active it was quite harmless. King stated that he was charging doctors only $50 for these pads, but implied that he would give it to the author free for a testimonial stating that it was a \"genuine cure.\" About this time, King was prosecuted in Cincinnati for the illegal practice of medicine and was reported to This was a typical advertisement used by J. Bernard King in defrauding the public. It was 4?DC of many that appeared in the cheap and nasty weeklies which participated in the profits of Kmg's quackery. have been fined $100 and sent to jail for thirty days. King then went to Phila\u00ad delphia, but, not prospering there, he transferred his operations to Los Angeles where he began exploiting his pads not only under his own name but under such imposing trade names as \"International Radium Company\" and \"Radium Products Company.\" The postal authorities found on investigation that King obtained the .substance which he used in his pads from a place in Nevada and the material that went into the pads cost King 5% cents for a pad which he sold for $15. On February 6, 1924, King's business was declared a fraud and debarred from the United States mails.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., April 12, 1924.) Jean Jacques Laboratories.-This concern exploited a piece of aphrodisiac quackery called \"Oxcentric.\" The stuff was advertised not through newspapers or magazines but by means of postcards sent to prospective victims. Ten million postcards, according to the government's report, were prepared and sent out for the concern by a Chicago advertising agency which also furnished the list of \"suckers.\" There were, of course, no laborato~es and the postal authorities empha-MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 95 sized that the outfit occupied two small rooms which merely contained office equipment and employed two girls, but no physicians, chemists or pharmacists. On February 18, 1930, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order against the Jean Jacques Laboratories debarring it from the mails.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., March 8, 1930.) Joy Beans Laboratories.-This was an indecent piece of quackery. \"Joy Beans\" were advertised under the claim that they were a sexual tonic. They were described as a \"preparation of roots, barks and herbs gathered from all parts of the world.\" As Joy Beans did not contain roots, barks and herbs gathered from all parts of the world and would not \"restore lost manhood,\" neither would they protect the sex glands from wear and tear nor build up the glands in 81-year\u00adold men to youthful activity, the business was declared fraudulent and in 1927 was debarred from the use of the mails.-(Ccndensed from The Journal A. M.A., July 16, 1927.) Kuro.-This was sold as an alleged cure for piles under such trade names as \"Kuro Remedy Company\" and \"Kuro Company.\" When the postal authorities began looking into the scheme, they reported finding it did a gross business of pver $10,000 annually. It had three employees, no one of whom was a physician, chemist or pharmacist. Following an investigation, the postal authorities declared that the alleged cure was wholly worthless and the scheme was one for obtaining money through the mails by fraudulent pretenses. On September 18, 1929, a fraud order was issued against the Kuro Remedy Company and the Kuro Company. -(Condensed from The Joun,al A. M. A., Oct. 12, 1929.) Carl C. Lantz.-For many years Carl C. Lantz of New York City and Atlantic Highlands, N. J., quacked it through the mails. In 1916 he advertised four nos\u00ad trums put out by Lantz, at that time operating under the trade name C. C. Lantz Laboratories. In 1918 Lantz had ar sixteen-page booklet describing the \"Lantz Absorbent Pastilles\" which were sold as \"the modern remedy for the prostate gland, the seat of sexual weakness.\" The same booklet, in addition to advertising the Pastilles, also advertised the \"Lantz Supporter.\" In 1924 and 1925 Lantz was advertising under his own name in Physical Culture, featuring at that time the Lantz Supporter. On October 10, 1927, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order against Carl C. Lantz covering both the New York and the Atlantic High\u00ad lands addresses.-(Condcused from The Jounial A. M. A., Oct. 29, 1927.) Lavex.-This was advertised as an alleged cure for that elusive but attention\u00ad compelling condition popularly called \"Catarrh.\" It was put on the market by the Lavex Chemical Company which advertised in about 500 newspapers and magazines which publications, in the aggregate, obtained $100,000 a year for their share in defrauding the public. The company also purchased \"sucker lists\" and circularized the people on these lists. Finally the Post Office put a stop to this profitable fraud in July 1926 by debarring from the mails the Lavex Chemical Company. The advertisements of Lavex declared that the product was the \"discovery of a famous French chemist\" which would \"kill the germs\" that cause \"catarrh.\" It was brought out at the hearing in Washington that one Prosper A. Maignen who operated the Maignen Chemical Company of Philadelphia was the so-called French !scientist. The evidence showed that Maignen was not a scientist, much less a !famous scientist; he was not a doctor nor .a professor. His education apparently feased with the high school. The ingredients of Lavex powder were reported by ithe postal authorities to be about equal parts of water-slaked lime and washing lsoda with small amounts of boric acid and alum. Investigation disclosed that ~e gross receipts for the business during 1925 were about $200,000 and during ~at period about 1,500 letters were received daily.-(Condensed from The Journal . M. A., Oct. 9, 1926.) 96 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS Lewis Laboratories.-This was a later name for a piece of quackery earlier known as the \"Druesen-Kraft Chemical Laboratories.\" The business of the Lewis Laboratories consisted of selling on the mail-order plan alleged sexual stimulants (aphrodisiacs). Victims were obtained l~rgely by means of full-page newspaper advertisements. There were no laboratories, the pills being put up for these quacks by a pharmaceutical house. No physicians or chemists were employed and, accord\u00ad ing to a report of the postal authorities who investigated the business, it was conducted almost entirely by girls who opened the letters, filed them, sent out samples and filled out cards for each person \"treated.\" The quacks did a large business, receiving about 500 letters daily during the summer and about 1,000 letters daily during the winter months. The concern advertised in about 300 papers. The postal authorities reported that the gross annual . income from these frauds was between $250,000 and $300,000. On March 19, 1925, the mails were closed to the Lewis Laboratories and Druesen-Kraft Laboratories.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., April 18, 1925.) Luculent.-The C. H. Johnson Medicine Company which did business from Chicago, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Lima, Ohio, sold a fraudulent consumption cure called \"Luculent.\" The concern was owned by one Orville G. Johnson, a negro of Lima, Ohio. The business was started in 1920 at Salem, Ohio, by Charles H. Johnson, father of Orville G. who took the business over in 1925. Johnson had no employees and prepared his nostrum in his home, mixing it in pans in his kitchen. The stuff was said to have been made from various herbs-sage leaves, senna leaves, thyme, bachelor button, seed, rhubarb root and a number of other well known herbs. Johnson advertised in several papers circulating among negroes. The advertisements and literature on Luculent were written by Johnson. Luculent was, for all practical purposes, a weak laxative. On April 11, 1929, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order debarring the C. H. Johnson Medicine Company at Chicago, Fort Wayne and Lima from the mails.-(Co1ulensed from The Jounial A. M. A., May 11, 1929.) M. S. T.-Mortin Products of Kansas City, Mo., and Denver, Colo., sold a neocinchophen-amidopyrine nostrum as a cure for rheumatism under the names \"M. S. T. Treatment\" and also \"Martin's No. l\" and \"Martin's No. 2.\" On August 31, 1935, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order closing the mails to the outfit. Martin's Products was promoted by three men, Menzel, Butler and Kight, the first two operating from Kansas City, Mo., and the third from Denver. The business was started in Oakland, Calif., and was an attempt to carry on a business that had been conducted from Houston, Texas, under the name of Martin Products. Menzel and Butler had been employed by the Martin Products concern which sold an alleged cure for rheumatism under the name \"M. S. T.\" (\"Martin's Specialized Treatment\"). In September 1934 the promoters of the Houston outfit were cited by the postal authorities to show cause why a fraud order should not be issued against them. At the time, the Martin (not Mortin) concern filed with the Post Office an affidavit stipulating that the business had been absolutely discontinued and abandoned and would not be resumed and the Postmaster at Houston was directed to return to the writers all letters addressed to Martin's Products, stamp\u00ad ing on the envelopes \"Out of Business.\" At this point it is worth noting that cases of acute yellow atrophy of the liver, some fatal, due to the use of M. S. T. (which at first was a cinchophen-amidopyrine product) had begun to accumulate. Menzel and Butler had in the meantime had trouble with their employers, Martin Products, and they adopted the name Mortin Products, copied the literature and advertising of Martin Products and attempted to duplicate the Martin Products preparations. They started business in Oakland, Calif., but the promoter of Martin Products went to Oakland and secured an injunction restraining Butler, Menzel et al., from ----------------- MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS operating under the name Mortin Products. Butler and Menzel thereupon moved to Denver and Kansas City and continued the operation of the scheme with adver\u00ad tising matter copied from that formerly employed by Martin Products. None of these three men was a physician, pharmacist or chemist-in fact, Kight was said to have been an oil-tank wagon driver and Butler to have been in the shoe business. When the Mortin preparations were analyzed by the federal chemists, both products were found to be tablets weighing about four grains each and containing over one grain of neocinchophen and slightly under one grain of amidopyrine, the balance of the tablet being milk sugar and chalk. There also went with the so-called treatment a bottle of \"M. I. T.\" (Martin's Intestinal Tonic) which the purchaser was told to use when a laxative was required. M. I. T. was found Ito contain a laxative drug, asafetida, ginger, red pepper and strychnine.-(Con\u00ad ,densed from The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 28, 1935.) [In 1936 it was reported !that a \"rheumatism cure\" was being exploited from Los Angeles by a concern using the names, Saxet Health Products and Martin Products, and headed by one F. H. Carroll.

R. 1Warn. As long ago as 1898, Warn was reported as having been arrested by :federal officials on a fraud scheme and on pleading guilty was sentenced to a !month in jail. Then there was one I. R. Warn who was sentenced in 1910 to !Leavenworth Penitentiary in another fraud. Later I. R. Warn seems to have ~een connected with the Warn Remedy Company which was alleged to be owned by his wife and his son, Stanley J. Warn. The son apparently ran afoul of the ~ederal authorities, for there was a Stanley J. Warn who was indicted and finally sentenced in 1918. The Warn Remedy Company put out a quick epilepsy cure, ~ealt with elsewhere in this volume. The Maro Company at the time the postal ~uthorities got around to it was not a Warn concern as Warn had sold the business in April 1931 to one Max L. Harris.

It r-vas said to contain thyroid, anterior pituitary and orchitic substance (for men) and ovarian substance (for women) together with a \"double chloride of gold.\" tf he Goldglan for men was recommended for the man who \"doesn't realize that he is not paying his wife the attention he formerly did;\" the Goldglan for women ~as to \"mold the soft curves\" and '1give her ripe, red lips, rosy cheeks and the fascinating charm of femininity.\"-(Condensed from The Journal A.

There also came with the device a tube of \"Prostone Medicated Ointment.\" The advertising booklet for this device featured what was called \"Our Irrevocable Guarantee\" which stated that if the purchaser was not satisfied after ten days' use the device could be returned and the money would be refunded. The company also guaranteed that to the best of its knowledge and belief its device was the only one that generated \"radiant, penetrating infra-red rays for the home treatment\" of prostatic trouble or piles.

This concern did a gross business in its last year of $400,000. It employed no physicians or chemists. The advertising for its last year cost over $200,000 which was distributed among forty-five daily papers-the greatest bene\u00ad ficiaries of medical swindles and the means whereby such frauds are able to fleece the public. The nostrum put out by the Melton Laboratories was called \"Korex.\" Later, two additional drugs were added to Korex and it was put out under the name \"Hiobin\" and there was created a \"paper\" organization called \"The Hiobin Company\" for its exploitation. Then, in order not to overlook any possible victims, a \"kidney cure\" was brought out that was called \"Renex.\" This was sold by the Renex Company, another \"paper\" concern. All three of these nostrums came from the same address, but the public had no means of knowing it as the addresses were camouflaged so as to cover this fact. Korex came from the Melton Building; Hiobin came from the Hoffman Building; Renex came from 322 E. 13th Street. The addresses were all the same-three fraud factories in one.

Modern Institute.-This was incorporated in 1931 under the laws of the State of New York. The business consisted in selling through the mails a so-called Triple-Action System for reducing persons suffering from obesity. Victims were obtained through advertisements published in magazines. The three preparations in the Triple-Action System were further described as: (1) \"Triple-X The obese public was urged to send $1.95 for the \"special introductory\" treatment. Those who sent the money received a small package containing two cylindrical paper boxes about an inch and a half in diameter and four inches long and a small collapsible tube. One of the boxes contained the so-called Triple-X Saline Salts, the other the Triple-X Bath Tablets, while the collapsible tube held the Triple-X Venus Cream. When these preparations were analyzed by chemists in the Food and Drugs Administration of the Department of Agriculture, the Triple-X Saline Salts were found to contain tartaric and Epsom salt and Rochelle salts. The Triple-X Bath Salts contained tartaric acid, soda and potassium phosphate. The Venus Cream was merely a vanishing cream with the odor of camphor. While the advertisements told the prospective purchaser that the \"system\" made the \"excess fat melt away, with almost no effort on your part,\" the victim was told-after parting with her money-that she should take various exercises, MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 99 any of which, according to expert medical testimony submitted by the govern- . ent, would be dangerous to a great many people suffering from obesity.

On July 24, 1933, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order closing the mails to this fraud.-(Conde11sed from The Journal A. M. A., Ocl. 7, 1933.) I National Goiter Treatment.-This piece of mail-order quackery was exploited +om Mason City, Iowa. Victims seem to have been obtained by agents. Repre\u00ad ~entatives of the company would go to the smaller towns and get in touch with 1,hose who either had, or who thought they had, goiter. Apparently a diagnosis fas made on the basis of a questionnaire of the type usually employed by mail\u00ad ~rder quacks. In common with the mail-order quacks, the concern used what it ~as pleased to call a \"guarantee.\" This bore a serial number and an imposing JJilt seal with a purple and yellow ribbon and stated that, (1) if after taking the :;,rational Goiter Treatment for eight months in the manner recommended by the concern and (2) if the concern's suggestions were followed out and (3) if t;he patient had written one letter every ten days telling of his condition, then (4) if the results were not satisfactory, the National Goiter Treatment Corporation ~greed to extend the time of treatment without charge until the corporation was donvinced that it \"cannot obtain satisfactory results.\" Then it would refund the rtioney which had been paid. Such a uguarantee\" was for all practical purposes f orthless from the standpoint of the public. Bottles of the National Goiter Treat\u00ad tpent were turned over to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory for examination. 'fhe only information on the trade package regarding the composition was that thich the law required; namely, a statement of alcohol content, which varied l:!etween 8 per cent and 17 per cent. Each bottle contained about 8 fluid ounces df a dark brown, syrupy liquid with suspended matter present and having an odor tiesembling so-called sarsaparilla. Iodides were present in one bottle and absent tom the other. The amount of iodide in the bottle which contained it was ~uivalent to 2.22 per cent of potassium iodide. Each dose contained the equivalent !1f 1.8 grains of potassium iodide. While the danger of administering iodides in ses of hyperthyroidism is obvious enough to physicians, it is not understood by t e public-even if the public knew that the National Goiter Treatment contained ~dides. It was not surprising, therefore, that there were reported cases of victims ho had taken this nostrum and suffered serious untoward results.-( Condensed f om The Jourual A. M.

They were also rbpresented as being absolutely harmless and especially beneficial to sufferers from ~ostate gland trouble. The advertising, originally, was done in newspapers, but i~ter newspaper advertising was abandoned and circulars were substituted. When the capsules were analyzed by the federal chemists, they were found to contain, i~ addition to glandular matter, extract of nux vomica and probably powdered cantharides I On May 10, 1932, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order 'osing the mails to the New Life Corporation, New Life, Inc., and T.

A., June 18, 1932.) 100 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS New Science\u00b7 Institute.-This was conducted by a mail-order quack who was not a physician, a pharmacist or a chemist, yet he sold products under the implied claims that they would cure \"prostate trouble\" and rupture. In the prostate field, this man operated under the name of \"Electro-Thermal Company\" which put out a device that was essentially a rectal dilator with a thermostat attachment that permitted the device, when placed in the rectum, to have its temperature raised by the electric current. In the same field, the man also operated under the trade name \"Harmless Remedy Company\" which put out, among other things, a rectal suppository containing a mixture of substances which, when a small amount of water was added to them, would generate heat. In the \"rupture cure\" field, this quack did business under the trade name \"New Science Institute,\" putting out a truss that was sold under the claim that it was not a truss and to which was given such fancy names as \"Magic Dot,\" \"Suction-Cell,\" \"New Science Retainer,\" etc. As these quackeries were carried on through the agency of the United States mails, the Post Office Department turned its attention to the rupture cure. In November 1934 the New Science Institute was called on to show cause why a fraud order should not be issued against it. The advertisements of the alleged cure for rupture were invariably illustrated, many of them showing women in bathing suits doing acrobatic stunts and conveying the idea that the women were ruptured but could do these tricks because they wore the New Science Institute device. At the Post Office hearing, it was admitted that the advertisements had been posed by professional models. The New Science Retainer, as the device was called more latterly, was a flat, circular, rubber pad having about the approximate circumference of a silver dollar; it was about three-quarters of an inch thick and had a number of shallow indentations on its surface. Although the advertising claimed that the appliance worked without belts, the New Science Retainer actually had attached to its outer surface a catch for the express purpose of enabling it to be attached to a belt called \"Duogirdle.\" In spite of this, it was represented, iterated and reiterated throughout the advertising that belts and leg straps were unnecessary in connection with the utilization of this so-called system. The govern\u00ad ment had no difficulty in showing that the claim that the device would cure rupture was fraudulent. As a result, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order April 25, 1935, closing the mails to the New Science Institute.-(Co11densed from The Journal A. M. A., Nov. 16, 1935.) Nuga-Tone.-This was sold on the mail-order plan by a Chicago concern called the \"National Laboratory\" which no more resembled a laboratory than it did a cathedral. Nuga-Tone was described as the \"Great Nerve and Blood Builder\" and was advertised in certain of the cheap-and-nasty weeklies. In March 1924 a physician reported that a two-year-old baby had got hold of a number of Nuga\u00ad Tone Tablets which had been carelessly left around and promptly went into con\u00ad vulsions followed by coma. The child did, however, eventually recover. A month later another physician in a different part of \u00b7the country reported the case of a boy, three and one-half years old, who in the parents' absence had climbed to a shelf in the kitchen and taken a number of the brightly colored sugar-coated Nuga-Tone Tablets. This child also went into convulsions and died on his way to the hospital. Nuga-Tone contained, among other drugs, bichloride of mercury, strychnine and arsenic. Yet this mail-order medical concern sent these tablets indiscriminately over the country to anyone who would write. The only warning that appeared on the bottle was the statement, so printed as easily to be over\u00ad looked, reading: \"Do Not Give to Children Under 16 Years.\" Under our inade\u00ad quate federal laws, \"patent medicine\" exploiters merely have to give the name and quantity of only eleven drugs out of the hundreds that may be used and some of the most deadly poisons known are not in the eleven which have to be named.\u00ad ( C o,uiensed from The Journal A.

Carver, to whom Lyell was indebted for printed matter and other expenses, conducted the business. bn January 15, 1927, the federal authorities issued a fraud order against the Oritone Company, Oritone Laboratories and George J. Lyell. Carver sold his hostrum in two forms : An 11-day \"treatment\" and a 30-day \"treatment.\" The 11-day treatment that Carver bought for 18 cents he sold for $2; for the 30-day treatment that Carver sold for $5 he paid 50 cents. Oritone was advertised as a E1 sitive specific for lost vigor and \"weakened glandular vitality,\" regardless of e age or sex of the patient. The evidence showed that the Oritone concern took about $18,000 a year.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M. A., Feb. 19, 1927.) I The Parry Medicine Compa~y.-This was a trade name used by a man who advertised himself as \"Dad Parry, the Healer\" and also as \"The Miracle ~an.\" Parry, who was obviously ignorant, used to bfag that he had been arrested and imprisoned many times. Apparently an effort was made some years ago to bbtain for Parry a special permit entitling him to practice medicine without riolating the Medical Practice Act. As soon as Parry got out of jail, he would go right back to his quacking. In time, however, the federal authorities took action as Parry was using the mails in his business. The \"medicines\" put out hy the Parry concern were fourteen in number and were numbered consecutively. jfhey were all essentially the same in composition, differing only in flavoring. They rere all sold at the uniform price of $1.50 for each 6-ounce bottle. The govern\u00ad ment chemists reported that each of the 11fourteen separate and distinct Parry F.edicines\" contained one-fourth alcohol (25 per cent), one-fourth water, one-half plive oil and flavoring material. Parry's nostrums were sold as cures for such ~onditions as tuberculosis, cancer, Bright's disease, leprosy, smallpox, diabetes, ~nsanity, blindness and various other ailments. Each bottle of Parry's nostrums contained over 6 ounces of a liquid of which \u00be was alcohol and the dose was an ~ntire bottle. Obviously, a person taking a dose of any of Parry's medicines would get the equivalent of 31/a ounces of whisky at 100 proof. Naturally, ~uch a dose-equal to two stiff highballs-might change the outlook of many bersons taking it and possibly cause them to view Parry's quackery in a somewhat tolerant light. In one of the cases against Parry, a woman testified that when $he visited the Parry headquarters and was given a dose of the Parry medicine ~he felt drunk. She also stated that in the rear room she saw nurses administering to many women who were sprawled out apparently drunk. Parry's business was k:leclared a fraud and debarred from the United States mails October 14, 1920.\u00ad icondmsed from The Journal A. M.A., Dec. 18, 1920.) I Peptono Medical Company.-This was a trade name of one Bert Sondergord pf Cairo, Ill., who also under his personal name sold a quack remedy for \"lost manhood.\" In 1927 Sondergord, under his own name, was advertising what he blled his \"L. M. R. Nerve and Gland Treatment\" that was said to be curing \"95 bses out of every 100\". This product was said to contain certain \"gland extracts\" !together with \"a salt of pure gold and yohimbine\". The L. M. R. Nerve and k;land Treatment was advertised as a preparation that would excite the sexual impulse and would overcome impotence. Sondergord also sold \"Double L. M. R. tN erve and Gland Treatment\" for which he charged an additional price. \"Peptone 1combination Treatment\" consisted of capsules to be taken internally and an oint\u00ad ment. The capsules contained powdered cantharides (\"Spanish fly\"), extract of ~ux vomica, powdered extract of damiana and iron and ammonium citrate. The 1 1ointment consisted chiefly of vaseline and camphor. The capsules cost Sondergord ~O cents a hundred and were sold by him at the rate of $4 a hundred. The ointment '\\ 102 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS cost him $3.50 a pound and sold by him at $16 a pound. According to the postal authorities, Sondergord was not a physician, chemist or pharmacist, nor had he had any medical training or education. He was previously a lumber inspector before he found quackery more profitable and much less fatiguing. He had no employees and ran his mail-order fakery himself. In 1929 after the postal authori\u00ad ties had looked into the matter, Sondergord's business was declared fraudulent and Peptono Medical Company was debarred from the United States mails.\u00ad (Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Oct. S, 1929.) Mme. Perry, Dermatologist.-Mrs. Sadie L. Perry carried on a fraudulent business under various trade names, such as \"Mme. Perry, Dermatologist'', \"Mme. Perry, Miracle Woman of the World\", etc. Mrs.-Perry sold through the United States mails a recipe for a preparation and also sold the preparation itself. According to Mrs. Perry, when the product was used it would grow hair on bald heads, stop falling hair, cure dandruff, restore faded and gray hair to its former color and make the eyebrows grow. A Post Office inspector who was assigned to the case sent a letter to Mrs. Perry stating that he had been bald for thirty years and would like some nice red hair. He enclosed a dollar for the recipe. In due time he received the recipe which called for given amounts of sugar of lead, sulfur, borax, alcohol and ammonia. Mrs. Perry also sold what she called an \"Evacuating Fluid\" and a \"Shampoo\". The Evacuating Fluid was apparently nothing but baking soda while the Shampoo was a solution of soap and water. Sadie Perry also offered to make a free microscopic examination of any hair that might be sent. A Post Office inspector sent the lady two strands from a horse's mane and Sadie came back with a letter stating that a microscopic examination had disclosed that the hair roots were too small and that they needed to be increased in size which would \"prevent them from falling out of the hair follicle.\" The Perry woman was not only without medical training but extremely illiterate. A fraud order was issued against her August 3, 1928.-( C ondc11sed fro11i T lie Journal A. M. A., Dec. 15, 1928.) Ponce de Leon Laboratories.-This was a medical mail-order swindle started by one R. James Gale of Miami, Fla., in April 1931. In January 1932 Gale sold a half interest in the business to one Verne R. Campbell and his wife and the business from then on was managed by Mrs. Campbell. The scheme consisted in selling a salve known as \"Ponce de Leon Cream\" for the alleged sexual rejuvena\u00ad tion of men. In the original advertising, Gale claimed that he devised the Ponce de Leon Cream after visiting Central America where he said he noticed that the native men, even though very old, were extremely virile. Gale claimed that he investigated and found that the women of the country made regular trips into the tropical mountains in search of \"certain rare roots, leaves and berries\" from which they concocted an ointment which their husbands applied locally. The postal authorities found that the facts were that the Ponce de Leon Cream was nothing more than a red pepper salve. A fraud order was issued against the Ponce de Leon Laboratories at Miami, Fla., November 29, 1932.-(Condenscd from The Journal A. M. A., Dec. 24, 1932.) Proprietary Mixtures Syndicate.-This concern and Yonga Yoga Scientist, Inc., were two imposingly named pieces of quackery operated by one Thomas \\V. Douglas and his wife. The scheme was to sell through the mails a number of \"patent medicines\" which Douglas called \"Formulations.\" His method of diagnosis was to require the birth date and from this he pretended to be able to determine what ailed the victim, and the evidence showed that he usually extracted about $100 from each person that \"bit\" on his scheme. On April 17, 1926, a fraud order was issued against Proprietary Mixtures Syndicate, Inc., Mrs. M. Douglas, Thomas Douglas and Yonga Yoga Scientist, Inc. The evidence showed that Mrs. ~-~----- ---------------------------- --~-- MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 103 Douglas had no medical training whatever, but Douglas claimed he had studied certain branches of medicine in this country and abroad and had made it a practice to pick herbs of various kinds since he was a boy. He was rather hazy as to the particular studies he had pursued in several universities he mentioned. He claimed he paid for his instruction, but admitted he was not enrolled in any medical institution. He confessed that he did not reach his conclusions from a medical standpoint but made his alleged diagnoses astrologicaily or by \"rule.\" He testified, however, that he did not need to know the exact moment and place of birth, as all the information he needed to determine what diseases or ailments individuals were suffering from was to have simply the date of their birth. Douglas testified at the hearing that he had treated approximately 1,500 persons. He also stated that the charges for the treatment were from $35.00 up. On this basis he would have taken from the public a minimum of $52,500. It was :probable, however, that these figures would run much higher, as the evidence showed that each patient was usually asked to pay Douglas around $100.00.\u00ad (C ondensed from The Journal A. M. A., May 15, 1926.) The Ritholz Quackery.-For many years four persons by the name of Ritholz conducted spectacle-fitting-by-mail concerns under various names such as : U. S. Spectacle Co. International Spectacle Co. International Spectacle House. Dr, Ritholz & Sons. Ritholz Optical Co. Self-Test Optical Co. World Optical Corp. Shur-Fit Optical Co. Clear Sight Spectacle Co. Dr. Ritholz Optical Co. Dr. S. J, Ritholz Spectacle Co. Dr. Ritholz Optical Co., Inc. Ritholz Spectacle Co. Physicians & Surgeons Optical Co. Consumers Spectacle Co. Nu-Way Optical Co. Capitol Spectacle Co. Nu-Sight Spectacle Co. The fraudulence of the scheme was shown in detail in an article by the author published in The Journal A. M. A., July 25, 1925, and a similar article written for the public that appeared in Hygeia August 1925. The Ritholz quackery, how\u00ad ever, continued to flourish. Finally, in November 1934 these variously named com\u00ad panies were called on by the postal authorities to show cause by December 10, 1934, why a fraud order should not be issued against them. The hearing was finally\" held in February 1935 and occupied nine days; the transcript of the testimony comprised more than sixteen hundred typewritten pages. The facts brought out at the hearing showed how large-scale quacks (it is reported that the Ritholz quackeries brought in more than a million dollars a year) could for years operate through the United States mails and defraud the public. The first move on the part of the postal authorities to curb these swindles was in October 1921 at which time one of the Rotholzes executed the first of several affidavits stipulating that the practices complained of would be abandoned and never resumed. The practices were not abandoned. The second move by the Post Office Department was in December 1922 at which time another affidavit was executed which proved to be equally worthless. The third effort on the part of the postal authorities was in 1925, but the charges were dropped without a hearing on a motion of the Ritholz attorneys. A month later, however, the Ritholz attorneys were advised by the Post Office Department that the Ritholz advertising was violating the postal frauds statutes. Nothing appears to have been done then, however. In 1928 effort number four was put forth by the Post Office Department and still another affidavit was executed by one of the Ritholzes. This also proved as worthless as the previous ones. Effort number five came in 1932 when the postal authorities produced thousands of complaints from dissatisfied customers and charged the Ritholz outfit with fraudulent use of the mail. By June 1933 another affidavit had been disgorged, promising to make refunds and proper adjustments 104 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS to more than twelve hundred complainants. The postal authorities reported that \"this affidavit was not faithfully executed in accordance with its terms.\" The sixth effort on the part of the postal authorities was made in November 1934 and the hearing was held in February 1935. At that time the Post Office Depart\u00ad ment finally issued a fraud order debarring the companies named above from the use of the mails. However, even this did not \"stick'' in its entirety for in June 1935 the fraud order as it affected the names Ritholz Optical Company, Dr. Ritholz Optical Company and Dr. Ritholz Optical Company, Inc., was revoked on a showing that those names were being usely solely for the operation of local optical stores and not for spectacle fitting by mail. The postal authorities at the hearing presented evidence-that a person of average intelligence might suppos_e was unnecessary-to prove that it was impos- Greatly reduced photographic reproductions of some of the numerous advertisements of the Ritholz concerns. sible to fit spectacles satisfactorily on the mail-order plan. It was brought out too that while the Ritholz concerns advertised that \"there was no guess work to their system\" the facts were the entire system was based on guess work and one of the Ritholz quacks conceded at the hearing that glasses can not be fitted by mail. It was further brought out that the lenses furnished by the Ritholz concerns were (1) inaccurately and poorly ground, (2) were not of a proper strength, (3) were incorrectly placed in the frames, (4) in some instances were chipped, cracked, splintered and decentered, (5) that many of the -\"bifocals\" were made by simply pasting or gluing an additional slip of glass on the lower segment of the lens, with the result that in some instances the glue was opaque and in others it was spotty, and in still others the segments or slips became detached. It was shown, also, that the claim that a \"trained specialist\" checked the lenses after -~-~. ~----\u00b7---~~------ MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 105 the spectacles were assembled was false, the so-called checking actually being done by untrained office girls. Many other fraudulent elements in the scheme were dealt with at length in the memorandum. The principal \u00b7 contention of the Ritholzes in the case was that their customers got exactly what they ordered. The postal authorities, on the other hand, stated that the evidence shows that this was false, the fact being that the customers did not get either what they had been led to believe they would get or what they ordered. Hence the fraud order debarring this pertinacious and impudent fraud from the use of the United States mails. The story was a sorry one. How many millions of dollars the Ritholz con\u00ad cerns took out of the pockets of ignorant but hopeful people is not of record. From the public's point of view, the tragic situation is that closing the mails to the various company names and to the manager and the sales manager was a rather feeble punishment to the Ritholz fakers who, individually, can still use the United States mails. It would seem that if ever there was a case which called for criminal prosecution this was it.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., ltdy 6, 1935.) Clara Ross, Inc.-This concern sold through the mails alleged treatments for \"sinus trouble,\" hay fever and stomach disorders. On October 30, 1934, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order against Clara Ross, Inc., because the con\u00ad cern was \"engaged in conducting a scheme for obtaining money through the mails by means of false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises.\" The company was operated by one Clark F. Ross, president and secretary of the corporation, who did business from a third-floor flat in St. Louis, Mo. Although Ross was purporting to treat human ailments, he had no medical or pharmaceutical qualifications; he was essentially a mail-order advertising man. \"Clara Ross\" was the name of Ross' divorced wife. In the advertising it was held out that Clara Ross had \"suffered untold misery from sinus trouble for seven years\" and that she had tried every known method of treatment, but all failed. Then, according to the advertising, she located a wonderful treatment and \"now my head is clear as a bell.\" As a matter of fact, Mrs. Ross admitted to the Post Office Inspector who investigated the case that she was not free of sinus trouble, but still suffered from it and expected to continue to suffer from it indefinitely I The alleged treatment sent out by Clark F. Ross to those who wrote for the sinus trouble cure consisted of a white powder called \"Toxic Poison Eliminator,\" an olive\u00ad colored liquid called \"Nostril Cleanser\" and an atomizer. The Toxic Poison Eliminator which was to be taken ipternally was found to consist principally of Rochelle salts with a small quantity of phenolphthalein and flavored with oil of cinnamon. The liquid to be used in the atomizer was found by the government chemists to be composed essentially of alcohol and boric acid with small quantities of sodium benzoate, eucalyptol, methyl salicylate, menthol, sodium salicylate and oil of thyme. Ross' hay fever treatment was the same as his \"sinus trouble\" treatment and in addition, a bottle of liquid called \"Eye Lotion,\" a tube of menthol salve referred to as \"Nasal Balm\" together with a metallic cup for the administra\u00ad tion of the Eye Lotion. The federal chemists reported that the Eye Lotion was simply a solution of boric acid and the Nasal Balm was essentially a salve containing menthol. The cure for \"stomach trouble\" that Ross had for sale consisted of his Toxic Poison Eliminator which formed part of the treatments for hay fever and sinusitis, plus a number of white capsules designated \"Stomach Conditioner.\" The latter was found by the federal chemists to consist of a combination of bismuth subcarbonate, magnesium carbonate, baking soda, chalk, powdered rhubarb, papaya and oil of peppermint.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Dec. 15, 1934.) .... 106 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS St. James Oil.-This was put on the market by one Harry Ellington Brook who for some years conducted a department of medical and qyasimedical misin\u00ad formation in the Sunday Magazine Section of the Los Angeles Times. Brook put after his name the letters \"N. D.\" which were supposed to mean \"Nature Doctor\"; he was also a chiropractor. Brook, while an exponent of so-called drugless therapy, was not above exploiting a \"patent medicine\" secretly and defrauding the public in its sale. St. James Oil was of course not sold under Brook's name, but was allegedly put out by a \"St. James Oil Company.\" The stuff was recommended for pneumonia, asthma, fever, piles and corns. When analyzed by the federal chemists, it was found to be nothing more marvelous than mineral oil, 98 per cent, and the other 2 per cent, oils of eucalyptus and lemon. On September 12, 1924, the postal authorities declared the St. James Oil Company and Harry Ellington Brook fraudulent and closed the mails to them.-(Coudensed from The Journal A. M. A., Dec. 20, 1924.) S-M-S Laboratories.-For many years a woman known as Helen Schy-Man\u00ad Ski and sometimes calling herself \"Mother Helen\" exploited a line of nostrums from Chicago. She had associated with her one of her sons, P. B. Schyman, who S-M\u00b7S Herb-Nu Health Institute AND in medicine in 1919 and licensed to practice medicine in Illinois the same year. It was not long after getting his diploma that Schyman and Helen Schy-Man-Ski were working together with Schman director\" of \"Helen Schy-Man-Ski and Sons.\" The Schy-Man-Ski business was mainly local and one hard to control under our present laws. If our present inadequate National Food and Drugs Act could prevent false and fraudulent claims for \"patent medi\u00ad cines\" being made in all advertising, the Schy-Man-Ski business would have been more respectable and less profitable. As it was, the Schy-Man-Skis were shrewd enough to confine their falsehoods to the collateral advertising not covered by the present law. But the Schy-Man-Ski concern was careless enough to do some of its business by mail, which brought them into a position where the public could at least be protected against this particular phase of their business. As a result, the postal authorities looked into the matter and on December 7, 1933, the Post\u00ad master General issued a fraud order debarring from the mails the S-M-S Labora\u00adtories, Inc . S-M-S Herb-Nu Remedies Company, Mother Helen's S-M-S Herb-Nu Remedies and their officers and agents as such. The government collected evidence to show that Schyman and his mother claimed the ability to diagnose and cure by herbal medication on the mail-order -------- ----~-~ - MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 107 plan such conditions as tuberculosis, syphilis, diabetes, gallstones, \"female trouble,\" kidney trouble and numerous other serious pathologic states. Schyman admitted at the hearing that on the basis of the data called for in the symptom blanks which he and his relatives furnished it was absolutely impossible to arrive at an accurate diagnosis or to prescribe proper treatment. At the hearing, Schyman admitted that, although he exercised general supervision over this mail-order quackery, neither he nor any other physician personally formulated the letters recommending various preparations sent to mail-order patients, but that the work was actually done by his -advertising manager and girl employees ! Schyman also admitted at the hear\u00ad ing that sales of \"S-M-S Herb-Nu Tonic,\" which was the chief nostrum exploited by Helen Schy-Man-Ski and her two sons, constituted approximately 90 per cent of the business done by the concern. The so-called Herb-Nu Tonic was a dark\u00ad colored, bitter-tasting liquid containing 25 ingredients, most of them of common herbs. The chief action of the mixture was that of a purgative and diuretic with sufficient unpalatable drugs to confirm the opinion frequently held by the ignorant that a nasty-tasting mixture must possess great therapeutic value. As a result of the hearing and the investigation, the mails were closed to this quackery. Unfor\u00ad tunately, the local and cash-and-carry quackery itself still persisted.-(Conde11sed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 10, 1934.) Science Publishing Company.-This Chicago concern was organized in 1924 and put on the market a book entitled \"Sex Searchlights\" which was advertised as \"The Most Detailed Book Ever Written on Sex and Love l\" The prospective buyer was told that before he was half through reading it \"he would gasp with amazement.\" The advertisements also implied that the book gave contraceptive information. As the book was put out by individuals who operated a number of pieces of mail-order quackery from the same address, it seemed possible that its sale on the mail-order plan might be for the purpose of obtaining a list of sexual hypochondriacs.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 13, 1930.) A Syndicate of Frauds.-On February 11, 1926, the Postmaster Generalissued a fraud order against a group of medical mail-order swindles that had been con\u00ad ducted for some time by three advertising men who fleeced the public from nearly every possible medical angle. Under the name of Dale Laboratories, they sold \"Virex,\" a fraudulent cure for deafness, a fake cure for \"stomach trouble\"-\"Dale's Wonderful Stomach Remedy\"-and a kidney cure humbug, Pre\u00ad scription.\" Under the trade name \"King's sold a pyorrhea cure swindle. As the \"Hilton Laboratories,\" they sold \"Hilton's Vitamins to Make You Fat.\" As Warren Laboratories, they sold a group of fake beauty preparations. Under the name Webb Chemical Company, they sold a fraudulent cure for asthma, the \"Famous Webb Combination Prescription.\" Under the name Walker Institute, they exploited to those with prostate trouble, \"Walker's Prostate Specific.\" Under the name Restorex Company, they sold \"Restorex Tablets,\" a weak man remedy, while they sold a fake rheumatism cure-the \"3-Way Combination Treatment\" under the name 3-Way Chemical Company, These were only a few of the twenty-seven schemes that were operated through the mails by these men. No physicians were employed in connection with any of the enterprises, although they did employ an Indiana mail-order quack. The Virex treatment con\u00ad sisted of an oil, a laxative tablet and a .nasal tablet for douche purposes. As a cure for deafness, Virex was an unadulterated swindle. \"Webb's Combination Prescription\" for asthma consisted. of tablets and a liquid to be used in an atomizer. A so-called complexion treatment, \"Clear-Plex\" and \"Plex-Tone,\" consisted of tablets to be taken internally and containing sulfide of lime and a liquid to be applied externally and containing such caustics as corrosive sublimate and salicylic acid. The trend of the Hilton's Vitamins advertising was to give the impression 108 MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS that the public was unable to get a sufficient quantity or the right kind of vitamins in its daily diet. The government officials showed that at least 86 per cent of the ingredients of Hilton's Vitamin tablets did not contain any vitamins and the remaining portion contained very small amounts. Part of the so-called Walker's Prostate Specific consisted of tablets containing among other ingredients methylene blue. The physiologic action of methylene blue was taken advantage of as is usually the case when this substance is used by quacks. The purchaser was told that a few hours after using the tablets that contained the methylene blue a blue color would be noticed in the urine. This, according to these quacks, was evidence that the \"antiseptic ingredients in the tablets are reaching the seat of your trouble.\" Of course the public had no means of knowing that anyone taking methylene blue will pass urine of a blue color. The alleged pyorrhea treatment consisted of a mouth-wash of \u00b7 a camphorated oil for local application, of some sulfide of lime tablets to be taken internally and some antiseptic tablets. These were but a few of twenty-seven mail-order schemes operated by the three adver\u00ad tising men.-(Condensed from The Jour11al A. M. A., Feb. 27, 1926.) Teycer Mail-Order Company.-One Robert L. Teycer of Chicago operated a mail-order quackery under such trade names as Association\" and \"Teycer Mail-Order Company.\" was not a physician, advertised in a matrimonial magazine that he had discovered one of the main causes of \"lost manhood,\" etc. His alleged remedy was of course a fraud and on April 2, 1932, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order against the business.-(Condcnsed from The Journal A. M. A., May 28, 1932.) Tuberclecide.-Charles F. Aycock for years sold a fraudulent \"cure\" for con\u00ad sumption called \"Tuberclecide.\" This nostrum was dealt with in some detail in \"Nostrums and Quackery,\" Volume I. When examined in the A. M.A. Chemical Laboratory, the stuff was found to be essentially a solution of creosote, or guaiacol, in olive oil. The story on Tuberclecide gave the history of Aycock and showed the various schemes in which he had been engaged. At that time Aycock was operating from New Mexico, but the local officials went after him so hard that he found it expedient to leave that state and go to California. While in California, he was prosecuted by the federal officials under the National Food and Drugs Act on the charge that the claim that Tuberclecide was an effective remedy for tuberculosis was false and fraudulent. During the trial, the United States attorney who was prosecuting Aycock took exception to some of the judge's remarks because he held that the prosecution was not being fairly treated. The case was a court and not a jury trial and the judge dismissed the case in favor of the quack. This was in 1917. Emboldened by his apparent immunity, Aycock continued to defraud the tuberculosis public until finally the postal authorities proceeded against him for fraudulent use of the United States mails. About Jan. 1, 1928, a fraud order was issued against the Aycock Medical Institute, Aycock Medicine Company, Aycock Medical Company and Charles F. Aycock.-(Co11de11sed from The Jounial A. M.A., March 3, 1928.) Vigaris.-One J. B. Brown, sometimes known as Blaine Brown, sold through the mails a product first known as \"Stamana,, and later as ''Vigaris.\" Brown purchased \"sucker lists\" and then circularized the names thus obtained. In his come-on literature, Brown's story was that nearly thirty years previously he had been rejected for life insurance and was told that his vitality was \"pretty well used up\" and that he was in the \"senile condition of a man about seventy years.\" The story then continued that his \"fire of youth\" having about died out left him with \"no ambition to do the very things men are created for.\" At about this time, he became interested in a drug store, which gave him access \"to the private formulas of the best physicians who were all the time sending their patients to the store with MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 109 prescriptions to be filled.\" Brown further stated that he was interested in anything that was prescribed for men afflicted like himself and out of the prescriptions he selected some that brought him \"back to abundant strength and vigor.\" All this, of course, leading up to the statement that if the person receiving a circular-letter would send Brown $2 he would send him a liberal supply of this prescription which he sold under the names Stamana and Vigaris---\"in a perfectly plain, sealed package.\" In October 1931, the Post Office Department, after going into the evidence in the case, issued a fraud order against Blaine Brown.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., N 071, 7, 1931.) Vitilor.-This device was promoted by the Vitalized Water Process Company of New York City. A six-page leaflet compiled by Carolyn Scofield Smith and sent out to physicians and others stated, either directly or by implication, that the Vitilor would cure among other things tuberculosis, diabetes, ulcerated teeth, chronic nephritis, pyelitis, asthma, pneumonia, high blood pressure and \"water on the knee.\" In due time the postal authorities got around to the Vitilor and the Vitalized Water Process Company. It appeared, following an investigation by the authorities, that the Vitalized Water Company and the Vitalized Water Process Company were owned and operated by Carolyn Smith. Miss Smith was not a physician but did claim to have studied chemistry. The Vitilor was described as a tank holding about two quarts and so made that water could be introduced at the bottom through which it was forced through charcoal, then passed through a small screen into and \u00b7through a chamber containing fine particles of aluminum. The water was drawn out through the top and was to be drunk in doses of from one quarter of a glass to six or eight glasses daily. The Vitilor which cost $10.50 to make was sold for $45. The postal authorities tested one of the Vitilors through the laboratories of the Food and Drugs Administration in the Department of Agriculture. The device was there set up and distilled water run through. it in accordance with the directions. The amount of metallic residue that was found in the water after passing through the Vitilor was absurdly minute and the government introduced evidence showing that the mineral content of ordinary tap water in various cities is largely in excess of the inconsequential amount added to water that had passed through the Vitilor. The amount of aluminum found in water that had passed through the Vitilor was less than the amount of this same metal found in the tap water of Baltimore, Detroit, Springfield, Ill. and Youngstown, Ohio. The govern\u00ad ment also presented evidence to show that various foods included in the daily diet contain more aluminum than was to be obtained by the treatment of water with the Vitilor. The scheme exploited by the Vitalized Water Company and Vitalized Water Process Company was declared a fraud and on July 6, 1932, the mails were closed to the concerns.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 10, 1932.) Wack's Gallbladder Capsules.-A druggist of Wayne, Pa., one Norman A. Wack, sold what he called \"Gallbladder Capsules\" on the mail-order plan. The capsules were pink in color and filled with colorless crystals that were odorless and had a slight saline taste. When subjected to analysis in t}le Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., it was found that the contents of the capsules were essentially sodium succinate. From the chemists' report, it appeared that Mr. Wack was dispensing about 20 cents' worth of sodium succinate in crudely filled \u00b7 capsules and charging the public $3 f9r them.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 3, 1932.) Western Drug Company.-This was also known as \"Great Western Drug Company,\" \"Western Drug Company\" and \"W. D. Company.\" It sold an alleged cure for sexual impotence and another alleged cure for \"rheumatism.'' The nostrum for sexual impotence was known\u00b7 as \"Hercules Tablets,\" sometimes \"Hercules Gland 110 CONCERNS Capsules'' the latter sold \"for persons unusually depressed.\" The advertising matter on this product was of the usual aphrodisiac type. \"Be a Healthy, Robust Man,\" \"Be an Attractive Woman\" were some of the slogans. When the Hercules Vitality Tab\u00ad lets were examined in the Bureau of Chemistry, they were found to contain iron carbonate, calcium carbonate, dandelion and strychnine, while the New-Vim (Hi\u00ad Pep) Gland Capsules were found to contain a mixture of gland substances with con\u00ad siderable thyroid. It was admitted to the postal authorities that the capsules contained thyroid, pituitary, suprarenal, orchitic substances and yohimbine. The nostrum was recommended for all rheumatic ailments and consisted of capsules and tablets. The capsules contained aspirin with minute amounts of other drugs; the tablets were purgative containing, among other things, croton oil and jalap. The claims made for both nostrums were gone into carefully by the postal authorities and found to be fraudulent. The government officials also reported that the concern turned over to a company that made a business of buying and selling \"sucker lists\" the names of its customers and it was able to make about $300 a year from this source alone. During the year 1927 the receipts from the business were $5,200. The rather imposingly named Great Western Drug Company consisted of two small rooms equipped merely for a mail-order business. On January 15, 1929, the Post\u00ad master General issued a fraud order closing the mails to the Great Western Drug Company, the Western Drug Company and W. D. Company.-(Condmsed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 2, 1929.) W. H. Y.-This was marketed by the Bartlett Nu Products Corporation and. was described by its exploiters as a \"100 per cent, concentrated food beverage.\" The alleged \"discoverer\" of W. H. Y. claimed that the ingredients of the prep\u00ad aration were extracts of raisins, figs, walnuts, peanuts, barley, wheat and celery. In October 1928 the Food and Drugs Administration of the Department of Agriculture issued a notice of judgment declaring that W. H. Y. was misbranded because of fraudulent claims made on or in the trade package for the product. A federal chemist reported that W. H. Y. was found to consist essentially of the water soluble constituents of caramelized cereals dissolved in water. The claims on the trade package that the stuff would aid digestion, assimilation and elimina\u00ad tion and that it was recommended by physicians and dietitians and that it \"feeds your glands\" were all fraudulent. Following this action on the part of the Food and Drugs officials, the fraudulent claims were removed from the package, but equally false claims were continued in advertising matter that did not go with the trade package. As W. H. Y. was sold through the United States mails, this brought the Bartlett Nu Products Corporation in conflict with the postal authori\u00ad ties. At the hearing in Washington, it was brought out that while the Bartlett concern claimed that a teaspoonful of W. H. Y. would furnish 460 calories it actually furnished only about 8 calories. It was shown that while it was claimed that W. H. Y. was rich in vitamins it actually contained no proteins or fats and contained no vitamins A, B or D. Part of the advertising for W. H. Y. stated that the product was the only food recommended by the \"National Aeronautical Association\" as the official food for aviators. The government showed that there was no such organization as the National Aeronautical Association. There were a number of other specific claims made by the exploiters of W. H. Y. which were shown to be equally false. As a result, a fraud order was issued against the Bartlett Nu Products Corporation on February 24, 1931.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Marcli 21, 1931.) Wonder Remedy for Men.-Mrs. N. F. Lockwood of Littleton, Colo. did business under the trade name of \"Frank W. Friend\" and sold through the mails a product called \"Wonder Remedy for Men.\" Mrs. Lockwood started the business about November 1928. She claimed to have had the assistance of her brother, Frank L. Palmer, in preparing the advertising matter. She got victims MAIL-ORDER CONCERNS 111 by purchasing \"sucker lists\" from letter brokers and similar concerns. Frank L. Palmer, brother of Mrs. Lockwood, formerly operated a similar business under the name of \"C. C. Campbell.\" Postal authorities investigated Palmer's business and a fraud order was about to be issued when he executed an affidavit declaring that he would discontinue the business. After Palmer filed his affidavit, he prepared circular matter \u00a3or Mrs. Lockwood, his sister, and the scheme was operated for a while by Mrs. Lockwood, with Palmer's assistance, under such trade names as \"Wagner Medicine Company\" and \"H. Curtiss.\" When a second investigation was started, the Wagner and Curtiss names were dropped and the name \"Frank W. Friend\" was adopted by Mrs. Lockwood. The claims made by the Lockwood woman in selling this fraudulent nostrum were of the usual aphrodisiac type. According to the postal authorities, Mrs. Lockwood got $2 a box for 100 pills which cost her 7\u00bd cents. On June 30, 1930, the Postmaster General debarred the Frank W. Friend fraud from the mails.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., July 26, 1930.) MECHANICAL NOSTRUMS E. R. A. (Electronic Reactions of Abrams) .-The late Albert Abrams of San Francisco easily ranked as the dean of twentieth century charlatans. Obtaining a diploma from the University of Heidelberg in 1882, Abrams practiced conventional medicine for some years in California. His first break with scientific medicine was in 1910 when he published a book on what became for a while a cult called Spondylotherapy. It was in effect a hybrid of up-stage osteopathy and chiropractic. For a year or two Abrams gave \"clinical courses\" on Spondylo\u00ad therapy in various parts of the country-price $200. In 1912 there was created the rather imposingly named \"American Association for the Study of Spondylo\u00ad therapy\" which later became the \"American Association for Medico-Physical Research\" with a membership that included many of the outstanding faddists and quacks of the country. When Spondylotherapy began to wane as a business asset, Abrams brought into existence his so-called \"Electronic Reactions\" which soon became abbreviated \"E. R. A.\" There went with this new cult various pieces of apparatus that Abrams leased to his disciples. Each piece was sealed and the lessee had to sign a contract not to open it. Among the many pieces of electrical hokum devised by Abrams, there were two outstanding devices. One was for the alleged diagnosis of disease; the other was for the treatment of such diseases as were diagnosed. The instruments themselves were reminiscent of some of Goldberg's inimitable cartoons depicting fearful and wonderful instruments for pulling a cork or feeding the canary or something equally important I Abrams claimed that by means of his diagnostic device he could not only determine the disease of a patient he had never seen but he could also tell the sex of the person and to what race he belonged. In fact, he went still further and finally claimed that he could diagnose the religion of an individual. All of these wonders were performed under the E. R. A. by taking either a drop of blood from. the patient (who might be any number of miles away from the diagnostic machine) or using instead the autograph of the patient. The drop of blood on a piece of white blotting paper, or the autograph, was put into the diagnostic machine which in turn was connected by means of a wire to a piece of metal pressed to the forehead of a healthy individual while Abrams or his disciple tapped on the abdomen of the individual who, incidentally, had to stand facing west in a dim light. According to various \"areas of dullness\" that were found by tapping on (percussing) the healthy subject's abdomen, there was deter\u00ad mined the disease from which the patient who had furnished the blood ( or the autograph) was suffering and also the location of the diseased area. Furthermore, by this device Abrams claimed that he couid tell whether the person who furnished the blood or the autograph was a Catholic, a Methodist, a Seventh Day Adventist, a Theosophist, a Protestant or a Jew. For it appeared that the \"area of dullness\" for a Methodist was not the same as the \"area of dullness\" of a Protestant-just why, Abrams never explained I The diagnostic instrument, according to Abrams, determined the \"vibratory rate\" of the disease. The treatment device known as the \"Oscilloclast\" cured the disease by applying to the patient the same \"vibratory rate\" as that of the disease of which the patient was suffering. MECHANICAL NOSTRUMS PHYSICO-CLINICAL MEDICINE 1 Religion I IN THE December, 1921, number of this Journal, we descanted on th.e \"Psychology of Religion\" and con\u00ad ceived it as morality in an emotional atmosphere. The psychologist can tell us nothing about emotions, and the same fate is accorded to ideas. It appears that from handwriting and the blood, religious belief may be determined despite the reception of this fact as stultilo\u00ad quence. The explanation of this phenomenon is relegated to others. My object is only one of recordation awaiting its proof or disproof by those who use my methods. Conduct the energy at V R 6 and use the S V reactions. The following areas have thus far been elicited: Fig. I-Areas of dullness: 1, Catholic; 2, M~dist; 113 Albert Abrams announced that by his \"electronic reactions\" be could determine the religion of a person, In the September, 1922, issue of bis house-organ Ph:y.rico-Clinical Medicine (page reproduced photographically above) Abrams mapped out the areas of dulness for (1) Catholic, (2) Methodist, (3) Seventh Day Adventist, (4) Theosophist, (5) Protestant and (6) Jew. Just why. -the area of dulness of a Methodist differed from the area of dulness of a Protestant was never explained. 114 MECHANICAL NOSTRUMS The absurdity of the E. R. A. was demonstrated at various times by sending in to some of Abrams' disciples specimens of blood purported to be from patients who were ill but actually taken from animals. One physician sent an Abrams disciple a drop of blood from a healthy guinea-pig. The Abramite diagnosed the case as general cancer and tuberculosis of the genito-urinary tract. Another physician sent a few drops of sheep's blood on blotting paper. A diagnosis came back of hereditary syphilis with an offer to guarantee a cure for $250. Many of the individuals who purported to diagnose and treat by means of the Abrams system simply charged their victims for diagnosing diseases which did not exist and then again mulcted them for treating these non-existing conditions. For some time, the E. R. A. was a gold mine to those who dabbled in it. Abrams' disciples were reported to be taking in from one thousand to two thousand dollars a week. The scheme was widely ballyhooed by Upton Sinclair and others. Many of the outstanding quacks of the country became lessees of the Abrams devices and the fact that Abrams would lease his instruments to osteopaths prolonged the life of their dying cult. Incidentally, it also resulted in forcing the chiropractors to bring out their piece of mechanical hocum (the Neurocalometer) in order to meet the competition of the osteopaths with their Oscilloclasts and other Abrams magic boxes. In 1924 Abrams died, leaving, it was \u00b7reported, an estate of about two million dollarsl-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A. of various dates.) 1-on-a-co.-One Gaylord Wilshire, who in his time had run unsuccessfully for Congress and also for Parliament on the Socialist ticket and had dabbled \u00b7 somewhat extensively in real estate and gold-mining stock, put on the market in 1926 a device he called the \"I-on-a-co.\" It has been dubbed, ironically, the \"Magic Horse Collar.\" The I-on-a-co was simply a coil of insulated wire (some $3.50 worth) about 18 inches in diameter, with a plug that permitted the coil to be attached to an electric light sicket. There was a smaller coil that played no part in the alleged curative use of the I-on-a-co but did play an all-important part in the magical features of the scheme. The smaller coil was also of insulated wire having its two free ends attached to a miniature light socket containing a flashlight globe. When the larger coil was plugged into an electric light socket carrying an alternating current (the kind of current found in the great majority of lighting systems), there would of course be generated within the large coil a weak fluctuating magnetic field. This would cause the flashlight globe in the small coil to light up (due to the induced current) when the small coil was brought in close proximity to, but not touching, the large coil. The phenomenon, elementary to a degree and known to every high school student of physics, furnished for the uninitiated that element of mystery that is so necessary in quackery. The I-on-a-co was used by placing the \"magic horse collar\" over the neck, around the waist or the legs of the person who thought that he was going to be helped by it. It was said to produce its effects by magnetizing the iron in the blood I It would have been just as rational of course to talk of magnetizing the iron in a bunch of spinach I The I-on-a-co, which could not have cost $5 to make, was sold for $58.40 cash or for $65 on the deferred-payment plan. Not a few newspapers and magazines were willing to share in the profits of Wilshire's quackery and many a full-page advertisement appeared in highly respectable publications. The success in the sale of I-on-a-co was due to the public's ignorance of the possibilities of magnetism. The public does not know that magnetism (not elec\u00ad tricity) has absolutely no effect upon the human body and its processes. The public does not know that the magnetic fl.we produced by the I-on-a-co differed not at all in kind from the magnetic flux produced by the earth, a flux in which every one who lives on this terrestrial sphere moves and has his being. MECHANICAL NOSTRUMS 115 The thesis on which the I-on-a-co sales talk was based misled those whose knowledge of magnetism and physiology never extended beyond-if, indeed, to\u00ad the elementary treatises used in the common schools. To say that many people used the I-on-a-co and were benefited is trite. The same could be said for the left hind foot of a rabbit caught in the churchyard in the dark of the moon ; it could be said for the horse chestnut ( or \"buckeye\") that certain individuals carry in their pockets ; it could be said for the so-called rheumatism rings worn by many who should know better. Such beliefs have not the slightest scientific significance. There is no quackery too absurd to find its defenders. The healing power of nature and the vagaries of the human mind are sufficient explanation. Photographic reproductions (reduced) of some of the testimonials for the I-on-a-co. It will be noticed that the magic horse collar cures gallstones, pernicious anemia, cancer, Bright's disease, baldness and other conditions I It also makes the dumb talk and the deaf hear I The reason that intelligent but technically ignorant people could be deceived by the I-on-a-co, even if they could not be taken in by the rabbit's foot, was because their general knowledge made it a little less easy for them to have the will to believe. Credulity is born of lack of knowledge rather than lack of brains.\u00ad (Condensed from Hygeia, Feb. 1927.) The Milo Bar Bell.-This device was a particular brand of dumbbells adver\u00ad tised under the claim that by using it \"You Can Become a Physical Super-Man.\" The company which exploited it reproduced in its advertising a \"before and after\" picture purporting to show the muscular development and increase in size and height of one John Sloan of Springlake, N. J. When the Federal Trade Com\u00ad mission got after the Milo Bar Bell concern for unfair methods of competition, the Commission developed the facts that the picture of John Sloan before using the Milo Bar Bell was taken when Sloan was a youngster of fourteen ; while the other picture-said to have been taken a short time after enrollment-was taken actually four years later when Sloan was eighteen. On February 10, 1931, the Federal Trade Commission issued a cease and desist order prohibiting the Milo 116 MECHANICAL NOSTRUMS Bar Bell concern from representing by pictures, statements or otherwise that physical development that was really attributable to natural growth had been brought about by the use of this particular brand of dumbbells.-( C ondcnsed from The Journal A. M. A., May 2, 1931.) The Neurocalometer.-This marvel emanated from the \"Fountain Head of Chiropractic.\" It was described as a measurer of nerve heat. It was probably brought into existence in order to permit chiropractors to meet the competition of osteopaths who had leased Abrams' fantastic pieces of mechanical fakery. The \"Neurocalometer\" appeared to be two thermopiles connected mechanically but separated sufficiently to allow them to \"straddle\" the vertebral column. From the thermopiles ran wires to carry the weak electric current (always generated when the thermopile is subjected to differences in temperature) to a galvanometer. Like Abrams' devices, the Neurocalometer, when put oil the market, could not be purchased but was leased. Also like the Abrams device, it was sealed and the lessee had to sign a contract not to break or tamper with the seals. The price of a lease of a Neurocalometer was $2,200-$1,000 cash at the time the contract was made and $10 a month for 10 years. The lessee was required to charge his patient $10 for a Neurocalometer \"reading\"-no cut-rates permitted. It was also announced at the time that the N eurocalometer was brought out that no other \"college\" of chiropractic would be able to lease a N eurocalometer and those who were considering taking up chiropractic as a trade were told that if they matricu\u00ad lated in any school except the one from which the N eurocalometer emanated they would not be eligible to lease a Neurocalometer.-(Condeused from T/ie Jo1m1al A. M. A., July 12, 1924.) Owens' Electric Belt.-A peripatetic quack, one A. P. Owens, defrauded the public for some time by the sale of a so-called \"electric belt.\" Owens advertised from New York, Chicago, Buffalo, Miami, Indianapolis, San Antonio, Woodcliff Lake, N. J ., and doubtless many other points. Owens sold his belt through the United States mails and in due time the postal authorities caught up with him. On July 18, 1922, Owens' scheme was declared to be one for obtaining money through the mails by means of fraudulent pretenses and promises and a fraud order closing the mails to A. P. Owens was issued against him.-( Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Aug. 12, 1922.) Plapao-Pads.-F. J. Stuart of St. Louis sold what were once called \"Stuart's Plas-Tr-Pads\" and later called \"Plapao-Pads.\" The device was for all practical purposes a strip of adhesive plaster with a small pad containing a simple ointment. It was sold as a cure for rupture. \u00b7 The padded portion of the plaster was to be placed over the hernial opening and the plaster itself applied to the skin. The theory was that the ointment in the pad would cause the hernial opening to close and the hernia to be cured. How much injury this device has caused will never be known, for the average person who finds that he has been humbugged is slow to admit \u00b7 the fact. There have come to the public knowledge two cases in which the Stuart device was alleged to have produced either death or serious injury. In one case a woman brought suit against the \"Plapao Laboratories, Inc.\" to recover damages for the death of her husband from strangulated hernia after using the Stuart device. The husband purchased the device, applied it, and four days later was dead from strangulated hernia. Another legal case related to a woman's experience with Plapao-Pads. After purchasing and applying the device, the woman suffered such pain that she was compelled to call a physician, who found that gangrene had set in with peritonitis. The woman was given judgment for $3,000 damages, but when the case was carried to the Court of Appeals on a technicality it was remanded for a new trial.-(Condensed from the pamphlet Mechanical Nostrums, 1923.) MECHANICAL NOSTRUMS 117 The Sculptron.-This device was sold under the claim that by wearing it one could change the shape of his nose-could, presumably, give a Jimmy Durante the nasal pulchritude of a Clark Gable. The Sculptron was sold through the United States mails. As it is well known that the shape of an adult nose cannot be changed other than by surgical interference, the postal authorities called on the Plastic Appliance Institute to show cause why a fraud order should not be issued against it. The chief owner of the Plastic Appliance Institute admitted at the Post Office hearing in Washington that his device had been worn by his wife over a period of several months without producing any material or lasting change in the shape of her nose. On June 8, 1933, the mails were closed to the Plastic Appliance Institute.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Aug. 19, 1933.) The Tank Treatment.-Within the past 15 years, there has been introduced a method of treating various diseases but especially diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and cancer by means of compressed air. The method was first put in operation in Kansas City, Mo., when a physician of that city had constructed a cylindrical tank about ten feet in diameter and nearly ninety feet in length. The tank was equipped with an air lock, toilets, shower baths, compartments and Pullman car equipment; such, at least, was the description given in an illustrated article which was published in the Saturday Evmi,ig Post in 1921. It was claimed by the exploiter of the method that the principle involved in treating patients under a pressure of several atmospheres was essentially a method of administering oxygen. It was stated further that the compressed air treatment would cause syphilitic patients with \"positive\" Wasscrmanns to become \"negative\" and those with tabetic pains to be quickly relieved ; it was claimed the treatment had appar\u00ad ently cured many cases of diabetes mellitus, hypertrophic arthritis and pernicious anemia. But scientific evidence for these claims was lacking I From advertising material that was issued at a time when there was an attempt to float two companies in California to exploit the tank treatment, it was claimed that the Kansas City physician was enjoying an income of $100,000 a year. The principle on which the compressed air treatment was supposed to work was that of forcing oxygen into the circulation, but in order to lend an air of plausibility to the scheme the inventor of the tank advanced the theory that diabetes, pernicious anem1a and cancer are due to certain germs that cannot live in the presence of oxygen (anaerobic bacteria). There is no scientific basis for such a theory. The Kansas City experiment interested a millionaire industrialist who was reported in the newspapers during 1928 to be financing the construction of a \"million-dollar sanitarium\" for the treatment of diabetes, etc., by means of com\u00ad pressed air. This was put up in Cleveland, Ohio, and the original exploiter of the method was put in charge of it. The news reports stressed the fact that the chief feature of the sanitarium was to be a huge steel tank, spherical instead of cylindrical in shape, sixty-four feet in diameter and five stories high. Time marches on and in December 1934 the editor of The Journal A. M. A. was notified that the original exploiter of the Kansas City tank ,vas no longer connected with the management or policies of the Cleveland tank. It was stated too that the Cleveland concern was no longer a profiting corporation but had been organized under the state laws as a non-profit institution. The reply made to this communication was the obvious one; namely, that there was still no scientific evidence to establish the thesis on which the principle of the tank treatment was predicated. By December 1935 it was reported that the previous controlling interest in the Cleveland steel ball and sanitarium was no longer connected with them and that the institution was closed. There was, however, some indication that it might be taken over by some commercial interest and reopened.-(C ondensed from The Journal A. M. A., May 5, 1928, witli additions.) 118 MECHANICAL NOSTRUMS Theronoid and Vitrona.-These were two more \"magic horse collars.\" They were similar to the prototype of this form of quackery, the I-on-a-co which proved such a gold mine to its creator, Gaylord Wilshire. One of Wilshire's employees was a Philip Ilsley who had operated I-on-a-co offices in different towns. Then Ilsley apparently decided to go into business for himself. Anybody could make one of the magic horse collars, which were merely coils of insulated wire with an attachment so that they could be plugged into the alternating current of the electric light system. Ilsley called his horse collar the Theronoid and organized the Theronoid Corporation. Offices were opened in many of the more important cities of the United States and it was reported that in less than a year approximately 12,000 Theronoids had been sold. Ilsley employed among other persons one Rodney \u00b7Madison who called himself a physician but was never graduated by any reputable medical school. Madison had a \"diploma\" from a chiropractic outfit and a California license of the drugless type. Madison had previously been employed by Wilshire, and even before Ilsley was running \"on his own\" Madison was exploiting another magic horse collar called Vitrona and operating under the trade name \"Dr. Rodney Madison's Laboratories, Inc.\" of Indianapolis. It has been lmown for many years by scientific men that magnetism (not electricity) has absolutely no effect on the physiological processes. The facts are, the human body has the same magnetic permeability as air, yet the exploiters of these simple solenoids-the I-on-a-co, the Theronoid, the Vitrona and a score of similar devices-would have the public believe that their pieces of magic, by magnetizing the iron in the blood, would cure whatever ailments existed. Because of the importance that these mechanical fakes attained from a public health point of view, the Council on Physical Therapy of the A. M. A. undertook certain experiments with the Vitrona and the Theronoid. At the same time working independently of the Council, Dr. Anton J. Carlson, Professor of Physi\u00ad ology at the University of Chicago, performed numerous experiments with the Vitrona, both on human and animal subjects, and found absolutely no effect on energy metabolism. Drs. H. B. Williams and Kenneth Cole of the Department of Physiology at Columbia University, with the most delicate scientific instru\u00ad ments, were also unable to detect that a human subject absorbed any energy when placed in the field of the Vitrona. Prof. Fred A. Rogers, head of the Departments of Physics and Electrical Engineering at Lewis Institute, Chicago, carried out a carefully conducted series of experiments on the Vitrona. As a result of his experiments, he reported that the human body has no magnetic property different from that of air and that there was no absorption of energy by a human subject when placed in the magnetic field of the Vitrona. Experiments similar to those performed with the Vitrona were made with the Theronoid by Prof. Rogers and Mr. Holmquest, former secre\u00ad tary of the Council on Physical Therapy. Absolutely no absorption of power by a human subject surrounded by the Theronoid could be detected and the magnetic flux generated by the Theronoid both with and without a human subject was exactly the same. To many, it must have seemed a waste of scientific effort and the time of busy men to have worked on these two self-evident fakes. Unfortunately, it some\u00ad times becomes necessary in the interests of the public health to produce scientific evidence of the fact that the moon is not made of green cheese.-( C 011de11sed from The Journal A. M.A., May 16, 1931.) The Vit-O-Net.-This was a large-sized electric heating pad or blanket, that sola for $102.50. As an expensive means of applying heat conveniently and con\u00ad tinuously, the \"Vit-O-Net\" had a place in the cosmic scheme. The concern that exploited it evidently realized that for one person that would buy its device as a MECHANICAL NOSTRUMS 119 heating pad, there were fifty who would buy it as a cure for whatever ailed them. This, probably, was the explanation of the Vit-0-Net concem's exploiting its heating pad under \"patent medicine\" claims. From the testimonials and claims made by the exploiters, the public might have been led to believe that the Vit-0-Net blanket would cure cancer, arthritis, Bright's disease, eczema, neuritis, paralysis, anemia, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, goiter, epilepsy, asthma, prostatic trouble, deafness and various other conditions. The thesis developed by the sellers of the Vit-0-Net was that the Vit-0-Net heating pad produced magnetic waves that would magnetize the elements in the blood and tissues and would set up a \"gentle vibratory action throughout the system.\" According to the advertising, the Vit-0-Net would reduce the obese from two to five pounds daily and would enable the underweight to take on nourishment and return to normal. \"When you are wrapped in the Blanket, your body with the exception of the head, is entirely surrounded by a current of electricity. You are in a magnetic field (Faraday's law). With 15,000 feet of magnet wire contained in the Vit-O-Net, considerable magnetism is generated. The metallic salts in the blood being an excellent conductor, the entire blood stream, a moving body, becomes charged with magnetic energy.\" Such was the concern's crude twisting of facts and fiction. It was true that, when one was wrapped in a Vit-0-N et blanket that was plugged into an electric light socket, the body was surrounded by a current of electricity. It was equally true that one was in a magnetic field. This might impress the ignorant but it didn't mean anything. One might also be entirely surrounded by a current of electricity when he rode in the lowly street car, and everyone on this terrestrial globe is constantly immersed in a magnetic field, owing to the magnetism of the earth. That the \"metallic salts in the blood\" became charged with magnetic energy was plain buncombe. Summed up, it may be said that the Vit-0-N et blanket was a convenient and expensive way of applying continuous heat to the body. Further than this, one could not truthfully go. The curative value of the Vit-0-Net Blanket was that of heat which differed not at all from that developed from a hot water bottle or from a hot brick wrapped in a sockl-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., March 10 and Sept. 8, 1928.) MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS In this chapter are either described or listed a large number of preparations which do not seem, logically, to fit in under more specific headings. This arrange\u00ad ment, in common with others in the book, is largely arbitrary. There are, for instance, listed in this chapter a number of \"patent medicines\" that were declared misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act because of fraudulent claims that were made for them as remedies for influenza. The efficient but overworked Food and Drug Administration, either under its present name or some of its earlier names, has made valuable efforts in the public's behalf to prevent nostrum exploiters from capitalizing epidemics. It is well known to those who are familiar with the \"patent medicine\" industry that a nostrum which under normal conditions may be sold for a variety of ail\u00ad ments is featured as a cure for some ailment that may become epidemic. This has been especially true in those sporadic epidemics of influenza which sweep the country-and the world-at varying intervals. During such epidemics, the nostrum exploiter who ordinarily sells his preparation for what-have-you, immediately rushes into print proclaiming his remedy as a panacea for influenza. It was thought at first that it might be desirable to devote a short chapter to the long list of \"patent medicines\" which ran afoul of the National Food and Drugs Act of 1906 because of fraudulent therapeutic claims in the treatment of influenza, but it was found on investigation that the bulk of these products were not what could rationally be called alleged influenza cures but were simply nostrums of th~ cure-all type which at a given period were being exploited as remedies for influenza. There was no reason to think that the same remedies might not during a widespr~d epidemic of measles or smallpox or some other contagious disease be pushed by their exploiters as cures for these conditions. It seemed rational therefore to bring these preparations into this same \"catch-all\" chapter dubbed \"Miscellaneous Nostrums.\" Alka-Seltzer.-This was described as an \"effervescent alkaline tablet\" and was heavily advertised as a remedy for \"common ailments.\" The entire trend of the advertising was to give the impression that Atka-Seltzer was simply a mild effervescent alkaline preparation. One of the largest newspapers in the middle west wrote, asking for an opinion on the merits of the preparation. The adver\u00ad tising manager who made the inquiry stated : \"It is my understanding that Atka\u00ad Seltzer is composed chiefly of sodium bicarbonate [baking soda] in an effervescent tablet.\" Some of the claims in the expensive advertisements that appeared in magazines made clear the attempt to mislead the public with regard to the com\u00ad position of this preparation : \"Atka-Seltzer Tablets are the most effective way to alkalize your system.\" \"A Tablet of AlkaScltzer in a glass of water makes a bubbling glassful of the vital alkaline minerals which you need to alkalize your system and relieve your cold.\" \"Don't confuse this new Effervescent, Alkaline tablet with the ordinary type of remedies. Atka-Seltzer is a scientific product-a corrective alkaline drink that first relieves the pain and discomfort of every-day ailments and then removes the cause. There is nothing on the market like it-there is no equal to it.\" Because of the large number of inquiries received regarding this product, the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory was asked to analyze it. The chemists reported that each tablet was found to contain about 4\u00bc grains of aspirin, nearly \u00bc grain MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS 121 of salicylic acid, nearly 18 grains of citric acid and about 28 grains of baking soda. It appeared, then, that this \"sparkling alkaline drink\" produced by dissolving two tablets of Atka-Seltzer in a glass of water, as was suggested on the trade package, contained nearly nine grains of aspirin and nearly one grain of salicylic acid in an S~t'CoOD BYE\"to \\ acidity tho common Cliuao of moat o/ you, ororyday ill,.

A person who followed the directions and took sixteen tablets a day would consume over seventy grains of aspirin and over six grains of salicylic acid in that period, together with the efiervescent ingredients, citric acid and baking soda. While the public has a 122 MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS general impression that aspirin is harmless, the medical profession knows\u00b7 that some persons have a special susceptibility to aspirin, which produces swelling of the lips, tongue, eyelids, nose or of the entire face, also hives, dizziness, nausea and sometimes cyanosis (blueness of the skin). Such persons, who have learned by experience that they are susceptible to aspirin, carefully avoid it. Yet there was nothing in the earlier advertising of Atka-Seltzer to lead anyone to suppose that this product is anything but a simple alkaline effervescent tablet containing no drugs of importance. Following publication of the facts developed by the A. M. A., the Atka-Seltzer advertising began to make mention, incidentally and vaguely, of an analgesic, \"acetylsalicylate.\" The chemical name of aspirin is acetyl\u00ad salicylic acid.-(Co11densed from The Jour11al A. M. A., Nov. 12, 1932, with additions.) AL-14.-\"Formula AL-14\" was marketed and widely advertised from Pitts\u00ad burgh. It was described as \"a compound of several of the principal alkaline salts which are contained in the body'' and \"are organic in form and get into the blood\u00ad stream almost immediately.\" According to the advertising, AL-14 was \"an insurance against Colds, Flu and Pneumonia.\" When analyzed in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory, AL-14 was reported to be a mixture of citric acid, baking soda and potassium bicarbonate. It was estimated that the cost of the ingredients of a two-dollar package of AL-14 could not have been more than ten cents.\u00ad (Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., April 28, 1928.) Anti-Phymin.-This was said to be \"non-poisonous to the fullest extent\"\u00ad whatever that might mean. All diseases, according to the Anti-Phymin exploiters, are caused by fermentation; and Anti-Phymin, it was claimed, stopped fermenta\u00ad tion l The A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory reported that Anti-Phymin consisted of a dilute solution of sulfurous acid and a very small amount of sulfuric acid. This put it in the same class as \"Liquozone,\" \"Radam's Microbe Killer,\" \"Oxytonic,\" \"Septicide,\" \"Zymotoid\" and various other containing as their essential ingredients sulfurous and sulfuric acid.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., A11g. 15, 1925.) BioFood.-This was sold at $10 a treatment. A \"treatment\" consisted of a box labeled \"A\" and two bottles labeled respectively \"B\" and \"C.\" BioFood A consisted of large tablets resembling in general appearance tablets of malted milk; BioFood B also consisted of tablets, but smaller in size; while BioFood C was a five-ounce bottle of a dark brown liquid with an aromatic odor. Some of the BioFood advertising was especially pernicious. There was a cruelly mendacious advertisement that ran in Chicago street cars ; it read, in part, \"Don't diet for diabetes, take BioFood.\" The A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory analyzed BioFood and reported that BioFood A might be considered to be composed essentially of milk sugar and flavoring in which there had been incorporated small amounts of iron, calcium and manganese salts. BioFood B was found to be about one-fourth table salt, about one-fourth Glauber's salt (the \"horse salts\" of the veterinarian) and the balance a mixture of potassium acetate, dried sodium citrate and filler. BioFood C, the liquid, was reported to resemble the Basham solution modified by the addition of very small amounts of calcium, magnesium, sodium and phosphate compounds.-(Condensed from The Joun,al A. M. A., Sept. 6, 1924.) Boracetine.-This preparation was put out from Chicago and in a large advertising campaign was heralded as \"The Guardian of Health.\" It was claimed that Boracetine was an \"all-around antiseptic\" that would keep the \"mouth, throat and nasal passages clean and sweet.\" It was also recommended to \"get rid of that 'dark brown taste.'\" By inference rather than directly, the advertisements might have led the public to believe that Boracetine would prevent influenza, consumption, I MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS 123 scarlet fever, diphtheria and many other diseases, Because of the claims made for it, the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory was asked to analyze Boracetine. The chemists reported following their analyses that Boracetine was apparently nothing more remarkable than a solution of boric acid, sodium benzoate and a mere dash of formaldehyde in water and alcohol together with some aromatic substances and sodium salicylate.-(Co11densed irom The Journal A. M. A., July 17, 1920.) Collum's Dropsy Remedy.-The Collum Dropsy Remedy Company of Atlanta, Ga., sold through the mails an alleged cure for dropsy. The treatment consisted of three boxes of large pills, or boluses, and five bottles of liquid preparation. The pills were known as \"Remedy No. l\"; then there were two bottles of \"Remedy No. 5,\" two bottles of \"Remedy No. 6\" and one bottle of \"Remedy No. 7.\" Chemical analyses made in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory and pharmacologic work on the pills, or boluses, done in the Pharmacologic Department of the University of Illinois College of Medicine disclosed that the pills, or boluses, consisted essentially of phlobaphene to which had been added extract of licorice and some flavoring. Remedy No. 5, sold under the claim that it would purify the blood, was a colored syrup of iron (ferrous) iodide. Remedy No. 6, sold \"for the stomach and digestion,\" was found to be a colored syrup of ammonium hypophosphite, while Remedy No. 7 which the exploiters said would relieve the cough that accompanied dropsy was simply syrup to which had been added muriate of ammonia. The purchaser of the Collum Dropsy Remedy was told that after taking the pills in the evening a large tablespoonful of epsom salt was to be taken at 6 o'clock the next morning and another tablespoonful at 7 o'clock and still another at 8 o'clock. The instruc\u00ad tions were that the pills were to be taken every other night and followed up by the salts. Obviously, whatever results were obtained in the reduction of the dropsical condition were due not to the Collum preparation but to the heavy and repeated doses of epsom salt. Dropsy is a symptom and not a disease and is usually the result of crippled kidneys or heart. As such, it is obviously not a condition for self-treatment and the sale of \"patent medicines\" for the alleged self-treatment of dropsy is without any justification.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Dec. 21, 1929.) Dur-Inda (Lukutate).-This, put out by the Durian Corporation of America, was a later name for what had previously been known as \"Lukutate,\" put out by the Lukutate Corporation of America. Lukutate started in Germany and in due time was relegated to the limbo of discredited nostrums. The stuff was then brought to the United States. There was the usual imposing array of German and Austrian testimonials. Lukutate was described as a food, not a drug. The Lukutate tincture was analyzed in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory and found to consist of a laxative in a solution containing 49 per cent of alcohol I Later, Lukutate was put out in tablet form and the stuff advertised, by implication, as an aphrodisiac. Then came the creation of the Durian Corporation and the change of name from Lukutate to Dur-Inda. Attempts were made to sell stock in the Durian Corporation and the come-on circulars asked prospective purchasers to consider the tremendous commercial success in the sale of Lydia Pinkharn's, VapoRub, Kruschen Salts, etc. While Dur-Inda was described as a \"compact, concentrated tablet containing 100% Oriental fruits,\" the facts were that Dur-Inda was a \"patent medicine\" ; that is, a package medicine, secret in composition, sold for the alleged cure or alleviation of disease.-C ondensed from The Journal A. M. A., Jan. 25, 1930, and April 23, 1932.) [Around 1931 there also appeared on the market a product known as \"Duryana,\" apparently similar to Dur-Inda.] Electrovita.-This was said to be an \"artificial mineral water\" described a little more in detail thus: \"A moderately mineralized alkaline, calcic, saline water Intended to combat excess acid and to assist nature in the elimination of 124 MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS waste matter. Not a specific or cure. Not habit forming.\" On the label, which was subject to the penalties of the National Food and Drugs Act, the public was told that Electrovita was simply water that had been \"treated by electrolysis.\" But the entire trend of such advertising as was not on the trade package and there\u00ad fore not subject to the federal law was to make the public believe that this city tap water that had been subjected to electrolysis had taken on some esoteric qualities which changed it from ordinary hydrant water into a veritable panacea for human ailments. The printed circulars of Electrovita deceived by implication. The \"lie direct\" was avoided, but the \"lie with circumstance\" loomed large to those who had any scientific training. Electrovita, it seems, was pushed in various parts of the country by high-pressure salesmen. The \"Electrovita Sales Manual,\" a well-printed, loose-leaf affair, used as a means of priming salesmen for their sales talks made interesting reading. The salesman was told to ask the prospect at the outset what his doctor said was the matter with him. This absolved the salesman from the charge of making a diagnosis, but permitted him to tell the prospect what he might expect from Electrovita. Especially enlightening were the instructions given to the salesman as to how to approach a victim with tuber\u00ad culosis, thus : \"TUBEllCUL0s1s--Pulmonary. You will be safe in accepting any case of the above, except where the customer is obviously too weak and seems about to pass out, but do not tum down any one. In all cases never promise complete recovery on less than 75 gallons of Electrovita, and in an advanced case it will take at least 100 gallons.\" The statement that the salesman should not \"turn down any one\" with tuber\u00ad culosis presumably meant any one who had money enough to pay for Electrovita l An original bottle of Electrovita was submitted to the A. M. A. Chemical Labora\u00ad tory for an examination. After making the analysis, the chemists reported that Electrovita consisted essentially of a weak solution of hydrated lime, equivalent in strength to about one-half that of official lime water. Electrovita, so far as the finished product was concerned-and that was all that mattered from the stand\u00ad point of the purchaser-was essentially lime water of half the strength of the official (U. S. P.) product. Whether Electrovita was made by the action of the electric current on the city water or whether it was made by adding water to lime water made no difference-except from an advertising standpoint. A gallon of Electrovita sold for two dollars ($2.00). Those who wanted a similar product minus the advertising hokum could take one cent's worth of lime and put it in a half gallon of city water. After standing for some hours in order that the water might become saturated with the lime, this half gallon should be poured off and diluted with another half gallon. At no greater expenditure than one cent, one might have the therapeutic equivalent of a gallon of Electrovita.-( Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Jan. 23, 1932.) El Zair.-The company that put this on the market-El Zair, Inc.-had for its American address 43 West 16th Street, New York City. The El Zair \"litera\u00ad ture\" gave internal evidence of an English origin in the magnificent abandon and almost unbelievable absurdity of its claims. The most important part of the El Zair \"literature\" was a reprint of what purported to be an article by the late W. T. Stead from the English Review of Reviews for March 1911. It is true, however, that the reprint sent out by El Zair, Inc. in the United States omitted some material from the original article and added some that did not appear in the English magazine. El Zair was advertised as an elixir of youth and its alleged discovery was described in the advertising material. According to a letter sent out by El Zair, Inc., the discovery of this marvel was due to the investigations \"of an English scientist of considerable note.\" According to Mr. Stead's Review of Reviews article, however, El Zair was not due to investigation by an English MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS 125 scientist but it was a rediscovery. It appeared, according to Mr. Stead, that an Arabic manuscript which came into the hands of a friend of his contained the formula for El Zair together with explicit directions as to where it could be found. Then came the touch that is so characteristic of \"patent medicine\" exploita\u00ad tion. According to Mr. Stead, the ingredients of El Zair \"could only be procured in certain 'lofty and almost inaccessible mountain ranges in Africa.\" The ingredients, it went on to state, were certain herbs that had to be \"gathered under certain phases of the moon and compounded with certain mystical rites.\" Mr. Stead, as a good journalist, went on to describe the perilous and hair-raising adventures of his friend in quest of the elixir. When it came to describing the marvelous effects that could be produced by El Zair, Mr. Stead let himself really go. He described one case of a septuagenarian who was as bald as a billiard ball; he used El Zair and \"the bald patch was covered with a plentiful thatch of hair.\" This incident was omitted from the American reprint of Mr. Stead's article-possibly because our advertising men decided that there are limits to American credulity. Another case described by Mr. Stead was that of a \"noble lady, who had long since given up all hope of presenting her lord with an heir;\" she took El Zair and \"became a happy mother in less th~n a year.\" This incident, too, the American exploiters omitted. But while the American exploiters deleted certain marvels from Mr. Stead's article, they made up for the deficiencies by putting in several paragraphs that did not appear at all in the original. They told of a man who was in the last stages of pulmonary tuberculosis and who had been given up to die but he refused to die. He took El Zair for six weeks and became \"to all intents and purposes a cured man.\" There were several other equally marvelous instances detailed in the American edition that did not appear in Mr. Stead's original article. Of course the adver\u00ad tising literature abounded with testimonials, practically all of them British and most of them allegedly from the aristocracy or the nobility. The follow-up adver\u00ad tising contained testimonials from mere commoners in the United States. In order to learn something about the composition of this rejuvenator, an order was sent in for El Zair. When received it was found to consist of a lumpy white substance in a moist state and having a strong pungent odor of acetic acid and an aromatic odor resembling oil of bergamot. The product was evidently impure as particles of straw and dirt were easily detectable. The purchaser was told to dissolve El Zair in water and sponge the body daily with the solution. He was urged to squeeze out the sponge after the treatment and save the spongings in separate bottles. It was declared that the spongings would gradually get darker until they sometimes became almost black. This, according to the El Zair exploiters, was the \"deeper seated waste matter\" that was the cause of old age and its infirmities. After the chemists of the A. M. A. had completed their work on El Zair, they reported that a similar solution could be made by dissolving 2\u00bd ounces of epsom salt in a pint of distilled vinegar I Here then was the mar\u00ad velous composition that brought back to life a dying consumptive, grew hair on the bald head of a septuagenarian and permitted a noble lady to become a happy mother---epsom salt and vinegar.-(Condensed from The Journal A.

FC-100.-Pittsburgh papers of February 22, 1930, reported that two officials and two employees of a local bank had been poisoned following the taking of a \"remedy for a cold.\" Two of the victims were so ill that they were taken to a hospital. Investigation disclosed that the nostrum these four men had taken was \"FC-100,\" put on the market by the Food Chemistry Corporation of Pittsburgh which also sold \"AL-14\" (which see). The concern at that time was circularizing bank presidents and suggesting by implication that they purchase FC-100 for themselves and their employees.

Specimens of the nostrum responsible were analyzed in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory and found to contain a dangerous amount of arsenic. MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS 127 referred to sent in to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory some of the FC-100 which was part of the package responsible for the poisoning. This material was analyzed and FC-100 was found to be essentially the same as the nostrum AL-14 except that in the particular specimens analyzed the FC-100 contained a dangerous amount of arsenic l FC-100 was essentially an effervescent mixture of citric acid, potassium bicarbonate and baking soda, plus the arsenic. A bank president in Iowa who had written for information regarding FC-100 inclosed the letter which he had received from the Food Chemistry Corporation. In giving the information desired it was suggested that there was no more justification for bank executives dosing their employees with nostrums of secret composition than there would be for medical executives recommending the purchase of wild-cat stocks by their employees.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.-A., March 29, 1930.) Ironized Yeast.-The public was made what the advertising men would call \"yeast-conscious\" by the extensive and intensive advertising of the Fleischmann product. The food faddists harped for years on the theme that most of us suffer from an iron deficiency. The facts are that as a medicine yeast has no important place except as a means of furnishing vitamin B which ordinarily should be, and would much better be, obtained from the grocer rather than from the druggist. As for a deficiency of iron, the average American dietary, rich as it is in meat, should make such a deficiency unnecessary if not improbable. But the public is not aware of these facts so that it is not surprising that, by plausible advertising, a \"patent medicine\" called Ironized Yeast was built up into one of the best sellers in the nostrum field. Ironized Yeast advertising was typical of the times. It played on, and tended to create, an inferiority complex. The young woman with angular lines was led to believe that what she needed in order to obtain or retain the admiration of the opposite sex was to take Ironized Yeast. The concern that put out Ironized Yeast issued an advertising broadside of the tabloid newspaper type called News Pictorial; it was a sixteen-page affair profusely illustrated. In it were articles bearing such captions as : \"What Kind of Women Do Men Stay in Love With?\" ; \"Husband-Stealer Beaten at Her Own Game-Wife Gets Wise to Herself in the Nick of Time-How She Won Her Man Back for Keeps''; \"Skinny Spouse Told Must Figure Out Love Tangle\u00ad Court 0. K.'s Hubby's Eyes for Curves\"; \"Real He-Men Pick 'em Plump.\" It is a rather tragic commentary on our boasted civilization that this sort of stuff could sell anything, but it evidently did. In the newspaper advertising of Ironized Yeast, skinny versus well-developed men and angular versus well-curved women were brought into juxtaposition with the object of showing how necessary a rounded figure-and therefore Ironized Yeast-was to achieve economic or social success or marital happiness. Ironized Yeast came in a bottle of fifty tablets costing $1-that is, the tablets cost 2 cents apiece. The public was urged to take from eight to twelve tablets a day over a period of from two to three months. At twelve tablets daily, a dollar package would last a little more than four days. The purchaser was urged to take Ironized Yeast for three months, which would cost $21.60. In some older adver\u00ad tising, the president of the Ironized Yeast Company was said to have declared under oath that each Ironized Yeast tablet contained \"the equivalent in vitamin strength of nine average yeast cakes a day.\" On a basis of twelve Ironized Yeast tablets a day, this would be equivalent to the vitamin value of 108 yeast cakes daily 1 In 1928 the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory analyzed Ironized Yeast and found, in addition to yeast, iron phosphate, phenolphthalein, calcium phosphate and chalk.\u00ad ( C ond,msed from The Jo-urn.al A. M.A., May 19, 1934.) Magic Materia Medica.-From Glenwood Springs, Colo., came a therapeutic marvel with the somewhat intriguing name, \"Magic Materia Medica.\" It was put on the market by one C. E. Krueger who called himself a chemist. According 128 MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS to Krueger, he discovered this product when he was assaying \"a certain rock\" and he declared that, so far, he had \"not been able to learn what this healing substance is.\" Mr. Krueger did emphasize, however, that his preparation contained just enough radium to be effective l But, whatever limitations Mr. Krueger exhibited regarding the composition of his product, he had high and lofty ideas of its therapeutic value. First of all, Mr. Krueger declared that Magic Materia Medica had \"cured cataract\" ; then, too, it was \"an excellent eye wash,\" \"heals granulated eyelids and strengthens the eyes.\" For catarrh and hay fever, one should take a teaspoonful twice a day, wet the nose and nostrils with the solution and \"sniff it up.\" For cough, take one-half teaspoonful. But this was only the beginning. Mr. Krueger assured Pimples, Stomach, Intestinal and Kidney trouble.\" Had you \"cuts, bruises or old sores?\" Wet the parts with Magic Materia Medica. It would, according to Mr. Krueger, stop the bleeding and pain immediately and there would be no inflammation or pus and it would leave no scar. It was also excellent for burns, sunburn and insect bites. It would remove corns and callouses. For pyorrhea, one applied Magic Materia Medica to the teeth and gums, while for sore throat one took a teaspoonful twice a day and rubbed the neck and chest with the solution. For piles it was necessary to apply the solution several times and take a teaspoonful. Had you \"birthmarks, liver\u00ad marks, \"It seems there is no limit to this remedy; it heals any ills of the human body.\" The A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory subjected this marvel to analysis. They reported that they found it was essentially a 10 per cent solution of a mixture of approximately equal parts of dried lime nitrate, dried chloride of lime and a very small amount of sodium iodide.-(Co11densed from The loimial A. M. A., Dec. 3, 1927.) Matamel.-This was claimed to be, and probably was, the concentrated sap of the maguey plant. The sap of maguey is used by the Mexicans in making the intoxicating beverage, pulque. Matamel was put on the market by a man who had the legal right to put M. D. after his name, but who had in 1924 been reported in the New York newspapers as having been arraigned on the charge of violating a section of the penal law which prohibits the placing in newspapers of advertise\u00ad ments relating to certain diseases. Matamel was advertised as a remedy for Bright's disease, \"bladder trouble\" and hypertrophy of the prostate. The postal authorities got after \"Newton Laboratories, Inc.,\" which was the trade name of the concern which put out Matamel and in July 1927 an affidavit was executed in which it was stipulated that the mail-order business operated by the Newton Laboratories, Inc., in the sale of Matamel through the mails would be abandoned and would not be resumed. This, however, did not protect the public from being humbugged by the Matamel quackery, for the Newton Laboratories simply changed their method of doing business. Instead of selling Matamel by mail, they split their profits with the drug stores which, after August 1, 1927, handled the nostrum. -(Couden.red frotn The Journal A. M.A., Nov. 12, 1927.) Mother Nature's Marvelous Powder.-This was sometimes called Mother Nature's Marvelous Remedy and sometimes P. G. Powder. It was put on the market by Nature's Mineral Remedy Company which did business from a postoffice box in Durango, Colo. The company was apparently a trade name for a man who, it appeared, had organized another concern known as the Colorado Natural Remedy Association of Denver. Analysis of Mother Nature's Marvelous Powder made in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory brought the report that the stuff was essentially a mixture of one part chalk and nine parts gypsum.-(Conde11sed from The lotlrnal A. M. A., Jan. 18, 1930.) MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS 129 Mu-Sol-Dent.-This was put on the market in Pittsburgh under the claim that it was \"the only existing nonirritating, efficient solvent of mucin and mucus.\" It was said to be \"efficient in the prevention and treatment of sore throat and colds\" and a product that would greatly hasten the healing of wounds and burns. Especially was it recommended for the removal of mucin plaques and film on teeth. While Mu-Sol-Dent was of greater interest to the dental profession than to the medical profession, there were many medical claims made for it. Mu-Sol\u00ad Dent was analyzed by the chemists of the American Dental Association who reported that the product was essentially a solution of common salt, potassium chloride and trisodium phosphate in water. More than three-fourths of the solid material in Mu-Sol-Dent was common salt. The stuff was flavored with aromatic essential oils and it was also colored.-(Condmsed froni The Journal A. M. A., Oct. 20, 1928.) N orma.-This \"patent medicine\" was put out from Albany, N. Y ., by the \"Norma Laboratories, Inc.\" It was sold under the claim that it would lower blood pressure. As it was a rather insignificant piece of quackery, the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory did not feel justified in making a complete analysis of the preparation. As most nostrums recommended for lowering blood pressure contain nitrites, qualitative tests were made in 1926 by the laboratory for these and they were found present. Some time later, the federal authorities held that Norma was misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act because claims made for it were fraudulent. In February 1928 the court upheld the officials' charge and ordered that the product be destroyed.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., July 31, 1926, and Nov. 24, 1928.) Pariogen Tablets.-These were marketed by the American Drug and Chemical Company of Minneapolis and were advertised as the \"new mode of personal hygiene.\" The euphemism, \"feminine hygiene,\" during the past few years has taken the place of the more honest word \"contraception.\" A huge business has developed in the sale of antiseptics and germicides that are frankly purchased, even if not obviously sold, for contraceptive purposes. Part of the Pariogen advertising was to the effect that \"Pariogen Tablets may be carried anywhere in a purse, making hygienic measures possible almost anywhere, no other acces\u00ad sories or water being required.\" The implications were obvious. The public was told that Pariogen Tablets contained no carbolic acid or bichloride of mercury or cresol, but it was not told what they did contain. A medical journal a few years previously had published an article by a woman physician who had used Pariogen Tablets and who stated that Pariogen was really paratoluene-sulfon\u00ad chloramide. This imposing, jaw-breaking term is the chemical name of the well-known product, chloramine.-(Comle,rsed from The Journal A. M.A., Feb. 7, 1931.) Pedodyne.-This was put out from Chicago under the trade name Kay Laboratories which was a trade style used by a man who had long been engaged in mail-order quackery. Pedodyne was said to be a remedy for bunions, corns, chilblains and perspiring feet. It was claimed that it would \"dissolve\" bunions and that it was a \"miracle of chemistry\" that represented \"years of study and experimentation.\" A package of Pedodyne was purchased on the open market and submitted to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory for examination. In the package were (1) a collapsible tube containing an ointment; (2) a carton con\u00ad taining a white powder enclosed in a waxed envelope and (3) an envelope containing thirty-four so-called protecting tissues resembling the ordinary pharmaceutical powder papers. The instructions with the package were that the sufferer from bunions should bathe the foot as often as necessary in water in which the white powder had been dissolved. Then some of the ointment was to be applied to the bunion, a small piece of the so-called protecting tissue put over the ointment and 130 MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS a piece of adhesive used to hold the paper in position. When the chemists analyzed the ointment, they reported that it was essentially an animal fat containing small amounts of camphor and menthol. The powder, which was to be put in the water in which the foot was to be bathed, was found to be mainly talc, boric acid and borax with small amounts of alum, zinc oxide and salicylic acid. The claims that such a combination would \"dissolve\" bunions and that it was a \"miracle of chemistry\" were of course preposterous falsehoods.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Aug. 11, 1928.) Ray-X.-Many people drink too little water. If they could be persuaded to drink more _water, their health would be improved and many minor indispositions ameliorated or removed. Quacks, faddists and others are familiar with this fact and capitalize it by putting on the market drinking water that is alleged to have been subjected to some mysterious hocus-pocus that has endowed it with health\u00adgiving properties that would have intrigued Ponce de Leon. Such water is always sold at a high price and those who purchase it drink it with a regularity and insistence bordering on a religious rite. It is not surprising that many such people whose liquid intake had previously been below that which it should have been find ~I... -DIABETES- II~: NATIONAL PATHOLOGICAL LABORATORY OF DETROIT REPORTS SHOW EXCELLENT RESULTS If You Are Suffering With Diabetes We Have News of Interest to You I CALL OR WRITE RAY-X 333 20TH STREET i at6 I I 11'1 ,_,,., I I r I their general health improved. One \"patent medicine\" of this type was called \"Ray-X Water-Liquid Sunshine.\" The only information given in the printed matter regarding the composition of Ray-X was: \"Ray-X is 100% pure distilled water subjected to a very powerful series of RAY treat\u00ad ments. These treatments, besides making it absolutely free from all impurities, impregnates it with certain properties and retains them in solution,\" Another leaflet stated : \"Its base is 100% pure Water, scientifically known as H2O. It is subjected to a series of pow~rful and penetrating Ray treatments ... The advertising was of a type common to that of \"patent medicines.\" In spirit it was claimed that the product would cure almost any ill to which the human body may be subject; in letter, however, it was denied that the product had any curative quatitiesl-(Comlensed from The Journal A. M. A., Aug. 6, 1932.) Psycosulphene.-From Spring Hill, W. Va. (population 200), came the medical marvel \"Psycosulphene.\" Psycosulphene was a \"product of Chemical Research\"-take it from the manufacturer. It was said to \"Promote Circulation Through the Feet.\" Those who were suffering trouble,\" \"run down constitution,\" \"nervous disorders\" or what-have-you were instructed to drop a small pinch of Psycosulphene into each shoe daily. \"The thoughtless will smile, MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS 131 but the wise know there are 27,000,000 pores in the soles of your feet.\" This powder, a pinch of which was to be put in one's socks, was the \"last word\" in such conditions or \"prostate gland trouble.\" The instructions were to put five pinches of the powder in the stockings or socks the first day, four pinches the second day, three pinches the third day, two pinches the fourth day, and then one pinch for every day of the remaining seventy-two days that the preparation was to be used. For \"best results\" the purchaser was urged to wear the same stocking \"from four to ten days I\" Psyco\u00ad sulphene was analyzed by the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory which reported that the stuff consisted essentially of baking soda, 40 parts ; borax, 40 parts; starch, 15 parts and sulfur, 5 parts. Summed up then, Psycosulphene consisted of a few cents' worth of baking soda, borax, starch and sulfur mixed together, put in a fancy box, given a misleading name and sold under false claims for $3.50. If the national law required the declaration on the label of the names and quantities of the ingredients of \"patent medicines,\" how many people would have been fooled into believing that this mixture would cure prostate trouble, blood poisoning, varicose veins or the score of other conditions for which Psycosulphene was recom\u00ad mended?-( Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., April 10, 1926.) Reolo.-This was marketed from Akron, Ohio, by a concern known as \"Dr. A. L. Reusing Laboratories.\" The advertising matter of Reolo bore the earmarks of another attempt to capitalize what certain \"patent medicine\" concerns have called the \"Biochemic Treatment.\" This \"treatment\" was based on the theory -which had no scientific basis-that all disease is the result of a variation in the inorganic salt-content of the cells. Starting with this hypothesis, it has been argued that all that is necessary for the treatment of any disease is to make good the salt deficiency of the cells. This is to be done by administering tablets alleged to contain certain salts in infinitesimal amounts. Examination of the medicaments used by the exponents of this theory usually disclosed nothing more potent in the tablets than milk sugar or something equally innocuous. The Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. analyzed Reolo and reported from the results of their examination it appeared that the stuff was essentially a mixture of cane sugar and chalk flavored with chocolate.-(Condensed from The Jot1,mal A. M. A., Jmie 11, 1921.) Robinson's Pernicious Anemia Cure.-From Sisseton, S. D., one W. A. Robinson exploited an alleged cure for pernicious anemia. Original letters written by Robinson indicated that he was a man without any general education and was obviously ignorant of medicine. Robinson's story was to the effect that in 1919 he had what the physicians had diagnosed as pernicious anemia and was told that it was unlikely that he would get well. He then set about it to find a cure for his condition and this he claimed to have done. Robinson's theory of the etiology of pernicious anemia was not new; it was to the effect that the condition is caused by intestinal parasites. He called these parasites \"Anemias\" and declared that pernicious anemia \"is not a disease at all, any more than 'cooties' is a disease.\" Robinson claimed that he kept up his \"research\" on the cause and cure of pernicious anemia for nearly seven months ( l) and then found both the cause and the cure; that he cured himself and two friends before he began putting the thing on the market. Robinson charged $30 for his treatment which he claimed would entirely remove the cause of pernicious anemia in 25 days. The treatment consisted of two parts ; one was coarse, sharp sand and the other was sometimes a green colored liquid and sometimes some \"liver pills.\" One patient suffering from pernicious anemia took Robinson's nostrum and the sand caused hemorrhages, resulting in the patient's death. Another victim also died following the use of Robinson's treatment and his physician wrote that _the end was hastened by the gastric dis\u00ad turbances induced by the treatment.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M. A., Oct. 24, 1925.) 132 MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS Salicon.-This was put on the market under the claim that it was \"an improved aspirin.\" The exploiters stated that they had \"rendered aspirin absolutely harmless and yet retained all its virtues as a medicine.\" Part of the advertising declared that \"the Massachusetts state medical authorities . . . adopted its use at all the state camps for fighting the Spanish influenza.\" A letter written to the Department of Public Health of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts brought the reply that \"the State Department of Health of Massachusetts did not endorse the use of Salicon for any purpose.\" An original bottle of Salicon was submitted to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory with the request that the product be analyzed. The chemists reported that each tablet of Salicon consisted essentially of a mixture of aspirin, magnesium carbonate and starch. In other words, Salicon was an ordinary mixture of well known drugs put on the market as a new discovery and foisted on the public under false and misleading claims.-(Coudensed from The Journal A. M. A., Feb. 5, 1921.) Sanovapor.-This was recommended for such conditions as: Catarrh, colds, hay fever, asthma, bronchitis, tonsillitis, sore throat, stomach, liver, kidney and bowel disorders, diseases of women, pyorrhea, gastritis, gastric ulcer, diabetes, Bright's disease, high blood pressure, piles, cuts, scalds, burns, wounds, sprains, abrasions, insect stings, old sores, boils, carbuncles, abscesses-and halitosis I Sanovapor was especially pushed as a remedy for diabetes. Like practically every other \"patent medicine\" sold for this condition, the exploiters emphasized the fact that the patient must carefully diet. Where this was done, the Sanovapor of course could have been poured down the sink and equally good-or better-results obtained. An original specimen of Sanovapor was subjected to analysis by the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory. The chemists found that the product consisted essentially of a very weak solution of sulfuric and sulfurous acids. There was nothing original in this preparation. \"Patent medicines\" containing small amounts of sulfuric and sulfurous acids have been marketed from time to time as \"Radam's Microbe Killer,\" \"Liquozone,\" \"Oxytonic,\" \"Zymatoid,\" \"Anti-Phymin\" and probably under still other names.-(Condensed from The Jonn,al A. M.A., Nov. 1, 1930.) Scar-Pox.-This preparation was put out by a concern calling itself the \"White Laboratories\" operating from 309 South LaSalle Street, Chicago. The Chicago telephone directory did not contain the name of the White Laboratories and a visit to 309 South LaSalle Street failed to disclose the White Laboratories listed in the official directory of that building. Even the elevator operators of the building did not know where the White Laboratories could be found. It appeared, however, that the White Laboratories had desk room in an office labeled \"Chicago Garage Owners Exchange.\" \"Scar-Pox\" was sold as \"the new guaranteed remedy for scarlet fever or smallpox\" and was described as \"a vegetable compound, abso\u00ad lutely pure.\" It was \"guaranteed by the makers to absolutely cure either scarlet fever or smallpox in three days when used as directed.\" When Mr. White was interviewed at the Chicago Garage Owners Exchange, he refused to give any information regarding his product which he sold at $15 a short pint. The Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. was asked to analyze this particular pernicious \"patent medicine.\" The chemists reported that this absolute-cure for smallpox was nothing but ordinary cream of tartar dissolved in water-less than one-half cent's worth of cream of tartar in a short pint of water -selling for $15. Thus was one of the most astounding features of modern civilization again verified ; any person, how\u00ad ever ignorant of medicine or pharmacy, can put up the most fantastically worthless mixtures and sell them as cures for some of the most serious diseases known.\u00ad ( Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., March 14, 1931.) ---------------------------------- MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS 133 Siroil.-According to the advertising, \"Siroil\" was \"a positive relief for psoriasis.\" In circular letters the sufferer from psoriasis was told: \"No matter how difficult or longstanding your case may be, Siroil will give you surprising relief.\" Advertisements stated: \"Siroil applied externally to the affected area causes the scales to disappear, the red blotches to fade out and the skin to resume its normal texture.\" Yet the Siroil concern declared that \"We are making no extravagant claims for Siroil.\" The alleged genesis of Siroil followed one of the well-known patterns common to \"patent medicine\" exploitation. The public was told that \"an outstanding chemist\" who had psoriasis and was \"unable to obtain relief from the best skin specialists\" began the inevitable \"intensive research in Siroil. the ni:w relief fnr psnrimcls hns brought expressions of 1trut1tude from men und me full lnformollun on Slroil-lhc \"\"\"' 1rc:111men1 of IJIOlriHIS an endeavor to find a cure.\" After six years he was alleged to have developed the preparation which \"successfully treated his own condition.\" Thus was born Siroil. Physicians know that there are few skin diseases more difficult to treat satisfactorily than psoriasis. The condition is frequently among the most intractable with which the dermatologist is confronted. Yet it is equally well known by medical men that many cases of psoriasis clear up in a remarkable way with treatment-with, however, the tikelihod of recurrence ever present. The Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. was asked to analyze Siroil. The chemists reported that Siroil consisted essentiatly of: Unbleached mineral oil, 16 beeswax, \u00bd.o part.-(Condensed from.

Spear of Marquette, Mich., a man who was in the real estate business, advertised in Detroit papers that he had made a wonderful discovery which had cured him and he wanted the public to have the benefit of this discovery. According to Mr. Spear's advertisements, he cured himself of \"Nervousness, Heart Trouble, Rheumatism and Catarrh.\" He said that prior to his discovery he \"was a wreck for six years,\" but after using the remedy that he evolved it not only cured him but he was \"perhaps the youngest looking and acting man in the U. S.\" at his age-seventy-six. In fact, he added: \"The more remedy I take the younger I seem to grow.\" The advertisement carried with it a coupon that was addressed to Mr. Spear and stated that the sender was enclosing $3 for which Mr. Spear was to send him the name of the remedy which made him a \"new man\" and also information as to how to use it. Mr. Spear, it should be emphasized, was not selling a remedy ; he was merely selling a \"formula\" to those who would remit $3. Those who sent Mr. Spear $3 received a printed slip of paper, smaller than ordinary note paper, headed \"Coal Oil-Nature's Wonderful Remedy (can be procured at grocery or drug stores).\" This was Mr. Spear's panacea. The printed slip then went on to state that for accidents, wounds, cuts or bums Mr. Spear applied coal oil (kerosene) immediately. For \"heart trouble\" he rubbed coal oil externally and took half a teaspoonful internally, first mixing it with water and later increasing the dose until he could take a teaspoonful straight. For catarrh and colds Mr. Spear used coal oil diluted with water in a douche cup. For dandruff and itching scalp he rubbed coal oil into the scalp, suggesting that \"if scalp is tender, add a little vaseline.\" For rheumatism he rubbed the coal oil externally and took it internally. Mr. Spear added on the same slip that if the purchaser had any poultry suffering from lice, coal oil would eradicate them and it was also invaluable for insect and fly bites of cattle. Mr. Spear's advertising campaign reminds one of the story of one who advertised that on the receipt of a dollar he would send the government-approved engraving of the Father of his Country. Those who sent in the dollar received in return a two-cent postage stamp.-(Condensed fro,n The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 8, 1923.) Sun and Moon Oil and Ointment.-From Hartford, Conn., an alleged \"divine healer,\" one Alfred W. Lowrie, used to mix quackery with his religion. According to the Hartford Courant, many prominent Hartford people used to place some reliance in Lowrie's quackeries. In addition to his work as a \"healer,\" Lowrie also made some excursions into literary fields to say nothing of his activi\u00ad ties as a \"patent medicine\" exploiter. Lowrie published his interpretations of \"Visions \u00b7of Life\" in which he was said to have claimed that he once died and while dead was ushered into the presence of the Supreme Being. On this special trip he was presented with the \"Key to Knowledge\" with the understanding that this knowledge was to be used by him when he returned to earth. It was after Lowrie's return from this celestial excursion that he began making \"Sun and Moon Sacred Ointment\" and \"Sun and Moon Sacred Anointing Oil.\" The oint\u00ad ment came in a little tin box on which it was stated that the stuff \"contains vibrations of life from the radio-activity of electricity, magnetism, electrons and atoms.\" This ointment was claimed to give \"quick relief'' in such conditions as influenza, neuritis, rheumatism, sunburn, hardening of the arteries and various other ailments. The A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory in 1924 analyzed Lowrie's ointment and reported that a similar mixture could be made by melting together 80 parts of cup grease, 15 parts of suet, 4 parts of oil of wintergreen, 1 part of oil of sassafras, a sprinkling of street dirt, and stir until cool. Lowrie's \"Sacred Anointing Oil\" was also subject to analysis by the same chemists. The oil was said to be unequaled for \"tired and sore feet, rheumatism, neuritis, hardening of the arteries and nerves, broken bones, skin diseases, toothache, chapped hands and sunburn.\" Taken internally, it was also a splendid thing for \"stomach, liver or intestinal trouble.\" The analysis of Sacred Anointing Oil disclosed that a MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS 135 similar mixture could be made by combining 87 parts of olive oil with 5 parts of tincture of amica, 5 parts of artificial oil of wintergreen, 1 part of oil of sassafras and 2 parts of water.-(Condensed from The Journal A.

It was sold at a price that would seem to be enormously in excess of the cost of its ingredients which doubt\u00ad less explains the vast sums that were spent in advertising. According to the advertisements, \"Its vapor kills cold germs.\" The claim was that by putting a drop of \"Vapex\" on a handkerchief or pillow a cold could be cured.

About half a bottle of Vapex was put in the bottom of the jar and the jar was sealed. Even under such conditions, it took from one to two hours for the germs to cease growing. Undoubtedly, if similar methods were used on a large scale with human beings, it could have been proved that Vapex would kill germs-and even the human subjects. Any intelligent person without scientific training should see the fallacy of such fantastic, socalled experiments. Vapex was analyzed in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory and from the results of the investigation the chemists reported that a solution having chemical and physical properties essen\u00ad tially similar to Vapex could be made by taking 15 parts of menthol and 15 parts of oil of lavender flowers and dissolving them in 70 parts of 94 per cent alcohol.\u00ad ( Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., July 18, 1931.) 136 MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS Witter Water.-This was advertised in newspapers and by circular letters as a remedy for high blood pressure. It was put out by Witter Medical Springs of San Francisco. The composition of \"Witter Water\" seems to have varied according to analyses published at different times by the exploiters. In the later analyses, sodium nitrite and potassium iodide were given as two of the ingredients which did not appear at a11 in the older analyses. The chief ingredients, however, seemed to have been baking soda, magnesium bicarbonate, common salt and calcium bicarbonate. In the older advertising, Witter Water was recommended as a \"positive cure\" for Bright's disease and diabetes and an \"infallible cure\" for diseases of the liver and bladder. It was also said to have the power of dissolving stone in the bladder and of curing paralysis. As the sodium nitrite content and potassium iodide content were something that the exploiters seemed to think worth talking about, it is worth noting that the amount of sodium nitrite present in Witter Water was 1\u00bc grains to the gallon. Witter Water sold for $30 for 6\u00bd gallons. The sufferer from high blood pressure got approximately 10 grains of sodium nitrite for his $30. He also got less than \u00bd grain of potassium iodide for the same sum. As a matter of fact, in order to get a single average therapeutic dose of potassium iodide, the patient would have had to consume more than two barrels of Witter Water at a cost of over $300.-(Co11de11scd fro,n, Tire Jounial A. M. A., Jm1e 27, 1925.) Yadil.-This was \"Tono Bungay\" 1924 model with one Alex Clement as Edward Ponderevo. To paraphrase H. G. Wells: \"Astraddle on Yadil he flashed athwart the empty heavens like a stupendous rocket.\" To the student of charlatanism it was interesting to trace the commercial trajectory of Yadil's inventor from obscurity to obscurity. At the time-1924-that Yadil was described at considerable length in Tire Journal A. M. A., the Yadil rocket was a vivid piece of nostrum pyrotechnic, but as was forecast at the time the stick would come down. It came down in 19251 Yadil originated in the British Isles and was heavily advertised there. It was exploited also in the United States. Yadil was alleged to be a glorified and esoteric form of garlic although analysis brought -out the fact that there was practica11y no garlic in it. Part of the \u00b7 advertising campaign was an alleged history of garlic as a curative agent commencing at .3500 B.C. and coming down to A.D. 1924. Just what the basic idea was is not entirely clear. Possibly there was the suggestion that no self-respecting germ would want to tarry in an organism saturated with garlic. British magazines that appealed to the intelligentsia carried full-page and double-page spreads of Yadil recommending it for tuberculosis, for cancer, for scarlet fever and what-have-you. According to Mr. Clement, the exploiter of Yadil, bronchitis, pneumonia, inflam\u00ad mation of the bladder, malaria, scarlet fever, diphtheria, meningitis and several other conditions \"are merely symptoms of one common disorder-internal infec\u00ad tion.\" Then, said Mr. Clement, the cure is obvious; Yadil destroys the internal infection I One British newspaper that refused advertisements of Yadil-the Daily Mail, said to have the largest circulation of any newspaper in the British Isles\u00ad went further; it published the facts regarding Yadil, written by no less an authority than the senior professor of chemistry in the University of Cambridge Sir William J. Pope. Professor Pope handled Yadil without gloves. The ~anu\u00ad facturers of the nostrum had claimed that Yadil was trimethenal allylic carbide\u00b7 Professor Pope after analyzing Yadil stated unequivocally that the stuff was not trimethenal allylic carbide. On the contrary, he stated that Yadil consisted of about 1 per cent of formaldehyde, 4 per cent of glycerin, 95 per cent of water and a had smell. Sir William Pope said that the smell could be closely imitated by adding an ounce of oil of garlic to a hundred tons of water. Professor Pope also pointed out that while Yadil sold at the rate of $20 a gallon a similar mixture could be made for 36c a gallon. Professor Pope's article was followed up with MISCELLANEOUS NOSTRUMS 137 a second one by Professor W. E. Dixon who was Reader in Pharmacology in the University of Cambridge. Dr. Dixon emphasized that the basic drug in Yadil was an irritant poison with a cumulative effect. Of course the Y adil exploiters retaliated with a libel suit and began action against the newspaper, Sir William Pope and Professor Dixon. The concern also applied for an injunction to restrain the Daily Mail from publishing further exposures. The injunction was refused. Then in the early months of 1925 came word that the Yadil firm was in bankruptcy. Its action for libel had been dis\u00ad missed in the high court of justice, the cost having been paid by the Yadil com\u00ad pany. A British pharmaceutical journal at about this time described a meeting of the stockholders of the bankrupt concern. It appears that at this meeting one of the stockholders suggested that the business be revivified, which he thought could be done if they were willing to sink about $250,000 in new advertising. The stockholder's diagnosis was that the Yadil business was \"suffering from poison gas.\" He was quite wrong. What it suffered from was too much light I The \"patent medicine\" business flourishes only in the darkness of secrecy and ignorance.

Banning obtained international publicity for his book by means of a story to the effect that his work was such a stupendous literary and scientific accomplishment that its author had been awarded \u00a32,500 by the trustees of the \"Benjamin Franklin Fund\" of London. Six months previously another piece of publicity had appeared in behalf of the same book. This was a story, purporting . to emanate from the \"Albany Chamber of Commerce,\" regarding the bringing back to life of a patient who had died \"at the County Hospital at Albany.\" The resurrection had been accomplished by a woman who had learned the trick by reading Banning's \"Mental and Spiritual Healing.\" So well was the \"Benjamin Franklin Fund\" story worked that the London Times, the British Medical Jourtial, the New York Times, the Literary Digest and some other equally high-grade publications published the matter as news. Banning took immediate advantage of the New York Times article by reproducing it, photo\u00ad graphically, and sending it out with an elaborate \"character sketch\" supposed to describe Banning and to have been written by a \"Dr. D. Phan.\" When the \"Albany Chamber of Commerce\" story appeared the case was investi\u00ad gated by the author of this book as Director of the Bureau of Investigation of the A. M.A. and found to be wholly without foundation. At the same time, Banning's antecedents were looked into and the information thus obtained was filed for future use. Then c_ame the story of the \"Benjamin Franklin Fund\" award to Banning for his book \"Mental and Spiritual Healing.\" The Chicago staff correspondent of the New York Times was given the facts which had been developed by the Bureau of Investigation with the result that that New York paper cabled to London for more information regarding the alleged \"Benjamin Franklin Fund.\" There of course was no such fund. The same corre\u00adspondent got in touch with the Los Angeles Times with the result that the Cali\u00ad fornia paper interviewed Banning and published some articles based on the interview. Briefly stated, Banning first gave the Los Angeles Times a tissue of falsehoods in an attempt to back up his fraud, but when the postal authorities began looking into the matter Banning made a full confession of the deceit and falsehoods of which he had been guilty. He admitted that the Albany story had been made up out of whole cloth; that the Benjamin Franklin Fund story was a figment of his imagination and that there was no such man as \"Dr. Phan.\" Banning's excuse for his farrago of falsehoods was that he did it as a joke in order to win a bet !

John Wyouge Barnes.-Much has been said of the ease with which impres\u00ad sionable women are, and have been, swindled via the psychoanalytic route. Sup\u00ad posedly hard-headed business men of more than average intelligence are duped, apparently, with equal ease. The case of Psychoanalyst John Wyouge Barnes is in point. MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 143 \"Dr.\" John Wyouge Barnes had a \"way\" with him. He was. never long in a city before he was passing most of his time at exclusive clubs . Evidently believing that paid advertisements were not only a wilful waste of money but also not good form, he got his publicity by appearing as a speaker before luncheon clubs. After having thus made his contacts with business men, Mr. Barnes would drop into their offices and casually suggest that they might do bigger and better things if they were properly psychoanalyzed and thus enlightened on their limitations and possibilities. Mr. Barnes carried after his name the letters \"M.D., M.A., Ph.D.\" He claimed the M.A. and the M.D. from Heidelberg and the Ph.D from Leipzig He also claimed to have been with Scotland Yard, London, for three years, although in what capacity was not clear He described himself as a world traveler, a character analyst, a consulting surgeon on mental disorders, a graduate of Columbia University, New York, as the sole survivor of the Princess Pat Regiment, as a financial consultant on National Cash Register financing, as a discoverer of men of brains for the British government-and as various other things. Business was going well with Mr. Barnes in Rochester, N. Y.; he was moving in the most select circles, psychoanalyzing bankers, insurance agents and others ; it was even said that one Rochester physician called him into consultation I Then Mr. Willson of the Better Business Bureau of Rochester happened to cross his path. It was not the first time. Mr. Willson had made the gentleman's acquain\u00adtance when Barnes was putting over a similar stunt in Toledo, Ohio, and at that time had suggested that Mr. Barnes produce some credentials. Instead, the \"doctor\" left town I The Better Business Bureau of Rochester called the attention of the police of that city to Mr. Barnes' record, whereupon Mr. Barnes was transferred from an exclusive club to the jail. Here he was held for several days on a vagrancy charge, in the hope that some of his victims might pref er charges. But no ; the psycho\u00ad analyzed business men were more than willing to let bygones be bygones and to charge their losses up to experience. Some of his victims expressed themselves as being utterly opposed to appearing against Barnes, because of the fact that it would put them in the unenviable position of having been played for \"suckers.\" John Wyouge Barnes, M.D., M.A., Ph.D., of Heidelberg, Leipzig, Columbia, Scotland Yard, etc., when cross-examined by the Rochester police, unfolded what he claimed was the real story of his life. According to this, he was born in 1884; when about fourteen years old, he began working on boats as a cabin boy. For a time he was a sales-clerk in different stores in London. It was while thus employed that he claimed to have discovered his psychoanalytic powers. He also claimed to have been a bookkeeper for seven months in the Bank of England, a claim which was probably as true as that he was a graduate of Columbia University. He came to the United States in 1918, and in the fall of 1919, as he put it, \"I added the degrees to my name.\" He admitted to the Rochester police that he had never been to college and that he had never served in the war, but that he had \"psycho- a analyzed\" in New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, Baltimore, Scranton, Indianapolis, St. Louis, Kansas City, Omaha, Davenport, Rockford, Beloit, Cleveland, Toledo and Roanoke. He admitted, on cross-questioning, that he had told some of the Rochester victims that he was in the British army and held a license to practice medicine. He admitted, also, that he had picked up $162.50 from trusting Rochester citizens with a psychoanalytical turn. In view of the fact that no one would appear against this impostor the Rochester police had to turn Barnes loosc.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Oct. 15, 1927.) 144 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS ~ W. H. Bates.-This man was a graduate of a reputable medical school and was licensed to practice both in New York and North Dakota. In 1903. Dr. Bates mysteriously disappeared from New York City and was discovered two months later in London. England. He was alleged to have given two explanations of his disappearance: one was that he had been called to perform an operation on a sailor and that while doing it the ship sailed; the other was that he had left New York THROW YOUR AWAY GLASSES They can he ducarded wltla joy and com\u00ad fort, U you will 11trengthen your ,: . ~~:., eyca tlm,ugh our \u00b7 ' New Coune ol A NEW COURSE OF EYE TRAINING BY BERNARR MACFADDEN and WILLIAM H.

A typical advertisement from Physical Culture advertising the \"course'' Dr. Bates and Bernarr Macfadden in collaboration. papare.t. by t while suffering from an acute case of loss of memory. Dr. Bates next turned up in Grand Forks, N. D., and apparently practiced there from 1904 to 1910. He then went back to New York City and from that place published a book entitled \"Perfect Sight Without Glasses,. and began urging people who had _errors of refraction to \"throw away their glasses\" and btiy his book-price $5. The book was said to demonstrate \"that all persons wearing glasses are curable with-MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 145 out them.\" Bates got wide advertising through the acceptance of an article by him by a popular magazine of wide circulation. This made his preposterous theories assume an importance out of all proportion to their scientific value. The sum and substance of the Bates' theory seem to have been that any person suffering from errors of refraction may train his eyes to perfect vision by per\u00ad forming certain ocular exercises and exposing his eye to intense light. This hypothesis is not only unsupported by, but is very definitely opposed to, the accumu\u00ad lated evidence of the science of ophthalmology. In 1917 Bates collaborated with the publisher of Physical Culture in turning out what was heralded as \"A New Course of Eye Training.\" This was heavily advertised in Physical Culture and the public was widely circularized and urged to purchase the \"course.\" Later, Bates' name was dropped from that particular advertising, but Physical Culture continued to feature the fad. In July 1919 Bates began publishing Better Eyesight, described as \"a Monthly Magazine Devoted to the Prevention and Cure of Imperfect Sight Without Glasses.\" This was essentially an advertising houseorgan for Dr. Bates. It was not admitted to second-class rates. While the publication purported to be sold at 20 cents a copy or $2.00 a year, the thing was apparently sent out broadcast without charge. Some of the material in Better Eyesight read as though it were the product of a psychopathic ward. Here is an example of Dr. Bates' lucid style, quoted from the first issue : \"When he [the patient] comes to realize, through actual demonstration of the fact, that he docs not sec best where he is looking, and that when he looks a sufficient distance away from a point he can sec it worse than when he looks directly at it, he becomes, able, in some way, to reduce the distance to which he has to look in order to sec worse, until he can look directly at the top of a small letter and see the bottom worse, or look at the bottom and see the top worse.\" t, Probably as good a criticism of the Bates' theories as has ever been published, appeared in the American, Journal of Ophthalmology some years ago under the title \"Science Versus Sensationalism.\" After calling attention to the fallacy of Dr. Bates' theories and the entire lack of scientific evidence for them, that journal said: \"Of course this hypothesis talces its sensational value from the fact that a great many people do not like to wear glasses. Thousands that are wearing them would like to discard them, and tens of thousands who do not wear them prefer to strain their eyes rather than give the needed assistance to their focusing powers. Such people would welcome any 'system' that would enable them to get along with\u00ad out glasses, as they would welcome any system that enables them to live without paying for what they eat or wear.\" Bates died in 1931, but his cult still persists.-(Cmidensed from The Journal A. M. A., Oct. 13, 1923 and Hygeia, Febmary 1933.) Paul C. Bragg.-This person who hailed from Los Angeles, styled himself \"Professor\" and modestly admitted that he was \"America's Foremost Lecturer, Teacher, and Writer on Scientific Living Principles.\" His scheme was one that has been popular with those who live by their wits. Ignoramuses with a flair for public speaking confer on themselves ornate titles, create paper organizations with high-sounding names, and give what are described as \"free lectures,\" but which are, in fact, merely pieces of come-on advertising for books and nostrums. they have for sale and especially for so-called classes, for which a round charge is made. Bragg, like many of his ilk, worked particularly along two lines : Food fads and sex. These two subjects are always popular with the kind of audience that will listen to charlatans of this type. In addition to creating himself a \"Professor,\" Bragg called from the vasty deep an alleged national organization and appointed 146 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS himself president of it: \"The National Diet and Health Association of America.\" Occasionally, Bragg worked on the ignorance or gullibility of preachers and got them to permit him to use their churches for his so-called \"free lectures.\" A report on one of Bragg's talks stated that Bragg had declared that the tonsils are spongy organs located in the throat and that tonsillitis is due to eating \"mucus\u00adforming foods\" and the mucus so produced is caught by the spongy tonsils and they swell up; that cancer is caused by eating \"gooey, slimy foods\"; that tubercu\u00ad losis is due to the fact that young girls smoke cigarets ; that \"colds\" are caused MIAMI DEMANDS MORE FRBE HEALTH LECTURES B7 Prof. Paul C.

Bragg's \"free lectures\" were invariably a come-on to advertise what he called his \"classes\" in which individuals might enroll at a cost of $25 each. The \"free lectures\" were also used to permit the passing of collection boxes and to notify the audiences that Bragg had for sale certain books and also a purgative, \"Allax,\" as well as certain other products. One of Bragg's books was entitled \"Cure Yourself' and contained the usual farrago of platitudes and nonsense common to MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 147 publications of this sort. In it, Bragg described a treatment for constipation \u00b7and recommended senna leaves because he said they were not drugs. Bragg of course was opposed to the use of white flour and white bread and had a substitute for each. He also opposed the use of common salt and sold \"Prof. Bragg's Live Sprinkle,\" price $1, as the substitute. \"Live Sprinkle,\" according to Bragg's advertising, was \"composed of the vitamin vegetables, blended and ground to a fine consistency, properly combined with enough sodium chloride to prevent your food from being tasteless.\" Bragg obviously considered that the audiences he would address would be sufficiently ignorant of the fact that sodium chloride and table salt are one and the same thing. In addition to food fad lectures, Bragg gave what he described as a \"one-night sex course,\" in which the class for women began at 7: 00 P. M. and the class for men at 8: 30 P. M., admission price $5--checks not accepted. A few years ago Bragg was careless enough to go into the business of mail\u00ad order quackery. His \"free lecture\" and classes schemes together with the sale of worthless books and fantastically advertised nostrums was a pretty safe game, at least so long as the general level of intelligence remained what it is and evan\u00ad gelical pastors would open their churches to charlatans like Bragg. Bragg's mail-order quackery was the sale of a \"patent medicine\" which he called \"Glantex\" which was said to be \"potent and powerful\" and to make \"many feel twenty years younger.\" On Dec. 30, 1930, after a hearing, the Postmaster General issued a fraud order against the \"National Diet and Health Association of America,\" \"Bragg's Health Center,\" \"Bragg's Laboratories\" and \"Prof. Paul C. Bragg.\" This apparently cramped Bragg's style, but he got around it by advertising himself as \"Paul Chappius.\" Presumably, the fraud order against Bragg's own name must have been rescinded for Bragg was carrying on his usual stunt in Miami, Florida in the early months of 1936, operating at that time from the Baptist Auditorium. As the southern Florida season began to come to an end, Bragg advertised in the Miami Herald of March 8, 1936 that \"Miami Demands More Free Health Lectures by Professor Paul C. Bragg, Nationally Famous Health Teacher.\" The advertisement stated further that because of the hundreds of demands that Bragg should remain in Miami a few days longer he had \"canceled his lectures in Washington, D. C.\" and would give five more \"free lectures\" at the Baptist Auditorium. Bragg's cancella\u00ad tion of his Washington lectures may, of course, have been due to the fact that suckers were still biting in Miami, but it is equally probable that the fact that in March 1935 the wide-awake officials in Washington, D. C. arrested Bragg, charging him with practicing the healing art without a license and got a verdict against him carrying a fine of $100. There is no federal law which could prevent Bragg's continuing his profitable schemes of courses and lectures. State officials could prevent it, but it is seldom that local prosecuting attorneys show more than an academic interest in such schemes as those carried out by Bragg.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Jan. 24, 1931, and April 18, 1936.) John R. Brinkley.-From what was a little crossroads village, Milford, Kansas, John Richard Brinkley was able to demonstrate the commercial possibilities of goat-gland grafting. Brinkley claimed to have obtained his preliminary educa\u00ad tion at Milton Academy, Baltimore, and to have received an honorary B. A. degree from Milton University. This so-called university was the parent of .what later became a diploma mill, whose \"dean\" was indicted and sentenced to six ~onths in the common jail. Brinkley also claimed an honorary degree of LL.D. from Oskaloosa College, Oskaloosa, Iowa. Other notorious quacks have claimed similar degrees _from the same institution. 148 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS In 1908 Brinkley matriculated at Bennett Medical College, Chicago, at that time an eclectic institution, and he appears to have been in attendance for three years, from 1908 to 1911, inclusive. Brinkley did not complete his medical educa\u00ad tion at Bennett, but in 1915 he got a diploma from the Eclectic Medical University of Kansas City, Mo. For good measure, four years later still-in 1919-he obtained another diploma from a \"diploma mill,\" the Kansas City College of Medicine and Surgery. Brinkley's own claims as to his whereabouts in the interim between 1911 and 1915 vary. In statements made under oath, Brinkley has declared that from September 1911 to June 1913, he was attending the National University of Arts a-.cb L.&bor&loria ----MIU0m,L'IIISl\\lll SA ' - Some of the various letterheads used at ditlerc:nt times by Brinkley. It will be noticed that. while the \"Medical and Surgical Staff\" lists and \"Board of Directors\" show what purport to f>e three physicians connected with the Brinkley institution, only one of them, Brinkley himself, was legally licensed to practice in Kansas. The other two \"M.D.'s\" claim diplomas from the Kansas City College of Medicine and Surgery diploma mill. and Sciences at St. Louis, Mo. The list of matriculants and special students of this institution from 1910 to 1914, inclusive, fails to reveal any one by the name of J. R. Brinkley. The documentary evidence offered by Brinkley of his alleged attendance at the National University of Arts and Sciences was a document issued by W. P. Sachs, State Superintendent of Public Instruction of the State of Missouri and Dean of the College of Liberal Arts of the National University of Arts and Sciences. Sachs played one of the star parts in a diploma mill scandal, and was placed under arrest on the charge of having issued some thousand or more fraudu\u00adlent preliminary education certificates. Sachs later admitted, under oath, that he had never met Brinkley and that the Brinkley certificate dated June 1913 was issued in 1918 for a cash consideration and without an examination I MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 149 Brinkley claimed to have entered the Eclectic Medical University of Kansas City in September 1914 and to have been granted senior standing, based on his three years' attendance at Bennett. He claimed, further, to have been graduated from this institution on May 7, 1915. This institution was not recognized by the licensing boards of forty states in the Union. It has since gone out of existence. In some of his advertising, Brinkley claimed to have held the position as plant surgeon with Swift and Company, Kansas City, \"where he was afforded an unparalleled opportunity for studying diseases . of animals,\" especially of the glandular parts of the animals. The facts were that Brinkley held a job in Swift's for just one month as a clerk. Brinkley put Milford, Kan., on the map and became politically powerful. In 1920 he was arrested on the charge of selling intoxicating liquors and maintaining a public nuisance in violation of the liquor laws of Kansas. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to pay a fine of $300 and to be confined in jail for 90 days and also to pay the costs. Five days after his sentence, a judge granted Brinkley a parole so that he escaped the fine and the jail sentence and had merely to pay the costs. In 1922 Brinkley applied for a license to practice medicine in California on the basis of reciprocity. The California Board, after making an exhaustive exami\u00ad nation of Brinkley's antecedents and educational qualifications, denied the applica\u00adtion. California papers in March 1922 reported that the managing editor of a Los Angeles paper had undergone the so-called \"goat-gland operation\" performed by Brinkley. This operation Brinkley played up in his advertising but he gave no publicity to the fact that the man died four years later. Then there was a testimonial from a Colorado senator that Brinkley circulated in 1923, the senator died early in 1924. . In 1924 Brinkley was indicted in California, charged with conspiring to violate the medical laws of that state. The California authorities requested the extradition of Brinkley, but the then governor of Kansas refused to honor the requisition. In 1925 and 1926 Brinkley was advertising that he had been awarded a degree by the Royal University of Pavia, Italy. As a matter of fact, the Italian institution did actually issue a diploma to Brinkley but, when it learned the facts regarding him, annulled it. Brinkley's chief method of advertising was over the radio. For some time, he maintained his own radio\u00b7 station at Milford, Kan. His specialty was for years alleged sexual rejuvenation by means of what he called his \"Compound Operation.\" In addition, Brinkley also for a while had what he called his \"Special Gland Emulsion\" which he sold on a mail-order, cash-in-advance plan. One month's supply of the \"Emulsion\" cost $100. It was administered with a rectal syringe. In 1930 the Federal Radio Commission closed Brinkley's radio station. Brinkley then transferred his broadcasting to a Mexican station, one of the most powerful on the continent, and for some time continued to broadcast by remote control from Milford, Kan. Finally, however, Brinkley found it desirable to leave Milford for, in the meantime (September 1930) his license to practice medicine in Kansas had been revoked. The state of Texas, however, which had also granted him a license, was less particular and Brinkley transferred his activities from Kansas to Texas. He continued to broadcast from a Mexican station, but had his office in Del Rio, Texas. Brinkley brought suit against the editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association. Following the filing of the suit, the attorneys for the American Med\u00ad ical Association had a thorough investigation made of Brinkley and his antecedents and unearthed much more material than had been given in the Journal's original article. Before the case came to trial, Brinkley withdrew his suit !-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Jan. 14, 1928 with additional data.) 150 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS P. L. Clark.-This man, whose full name is Percival Lemon Clark, was born in 1866 and received a diploma in 1889 from an eclectic medical school that was run by his father. Clark conducted a so-called \"Health School\" and \"Health Home\" and founded a cult which he called \"Sanatology.\" He made attempts at different times to get the state legislature of Illinois to recognize his cult. Dr. Clark, in addition to \"treating\" patients, also sold certain merchandise in the form of alleged health foods, an enema and a book, \"How to Live and Eat for Health.\" On March 31, 1928, the Bureau of Investigation of the A.

One of these was that the \"Sugar Trust,\" as Oark put it, \"finally became strong enough so that the Maine was blown up from the inside that we might have excuse for collaring the control of the sugar of Cuba and the Philippines.\" \u00b7 In 1929 the author of this book, then Director of the Bureau of Investigation of the A. M. A., went to Washington to protest before the Federal Radio Com\u00ad mission against certain quack advertising that was going over a Chicago radio station. Oark's broadcasting was one of the pieces against which the protest was made and in the evidence given the Commission, Clark was characterized as a quack. As a result, Clark brought suit against the Director of the Bureau of ------- ----\u00b7-\u00b7- ... ----- -\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 -- MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 151 Investigation and the A. M. A. for a fantastically large sum, charging slander. The case dragged along for more than three years and when the attorneys for the A. M. A. attempted to force the matter to trial Clark withdrew the suit. In preparing for the trial, the attorneys for the Association employed investigators who developed the following additional facts regarding Clark : For about two years following the granting of a degree of medicine by the eclectic institution that his father ran, Clark practiced medicine in association with his father. During the balance of the forty-year period between his graduation in 1889 and the time that he brought suit in 1929, Clark was at various times a gold miner in Georgia, in the rubber business in Chicago, in the clock-making business in Connecticut and Illinois, in the restaurant business in Chicago, raised sea island cotton in San Domingo, sold real estate and oil stock in Canada, sold autographic registers in Michigan, was engaged in publicity and the selling of houses at Grasselli, N. J., and had worked in a fad medicine institution out in Denver.\u00ad (Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., March 31, 1928, with additions.) Thomas Webster Edgar.-This man, who did business from New York City, was born in 1889 and was granted a diploma in medicine from the University and Bellevue Hospital Medical College in 1913. He was licensed to practice medicine in the state of New York the same year. In 1919 Dr. Edgar claimed to have developed a \"serum\" for the cure of diabetes. A man in Chicago who had read the newspaper story regarding Edgar's alleged treatment wrote to the doctor asking for details regarding terms. Dr. Edgar replied that he would see the man in consultation with his regular physician and that his custom was to have \"all fees paid in advance,\" his charge being $200 which was to be sent by certified check or money order. After the newspaper publicity on Dr. Edgar's diabetic \"serum\" died down, he published an article on \"Sterility, Sex Stimulation and Endocrines.\" He claimed in this that he had developed another serum. His diabetic \"serum'' had allegedly been obtained from fatigued rabbits. The \"sex stimulation serum\" apparently was short-lived for soon after his announcement of the \"serum\" Dr. Edgar admitted that he was now treating all cases of \"sterility,\" etc. \"by operation instead of the serum.\" The fee for the operation was $500, inclusive of the sanitarium charges. In October, 1921, a series of sensational articles appeared regarding one of Dr. Edgar's alleged gland implantations. It was played up in the style of typical yellow journalism and was illustrated with pictures not only of the individual who was operated on but also of Thomas Webster Edgar and of one of the \"ring-tailea. monkeys,\" from which the glands were obtained.-(Con\u00ad densed from The Journal A. M. A., Oct. 15, 1921.) J. Paul Fernel.-This man's name originally was Giovanni Furno. He received a diploma from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Chicago, School of Medicine of the University of Illinois, in 1911 and an Illinois license of the same year. In 1919 Fernet, under his earlier name Furno, was connected with an advertising office in Detroit. Following actions by the local officials, he left the state. From Detroit he went back to Chicago and into the plastic surgery field. Dr. Fernel's Ittinois license was first revoked in 1920 because of dis\u00ad honorable conduct, but was restored by the Illinois Board two years later. It was revoked again by the same state in 1926, but in 1927 the courts overruled the state's revocation and the license was restored. Fernel's activities were the subject of an article published in The Journal A. M. A., July 3, 1926, and the matter was reprinted in the pamphlet '1Misce1Janeous Specialists.\" Later, Fernet stated that he wanted to practice ethical medicine and he was finally able to obtain mem\u00ad bership in the Chicago Medical Society, but not long thereafter he began adver\u00ad tising again. As a result, charges of unethical conduct were preferred against him and after a hearing before a committee he was expelled from membership.\u00ad ( Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., lt,ly 3, 1926, with additions.) 152 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS Dinshah P. Ghadiali.-As exponent of \"Spectro-Chrome Therapy\" and the founder of the \"Spectro-Chrome Institute,\" Dinshah P. Ghadiali, put after his name the letters \"M.D., D.C., Ph.D., LL.D.\" So far as the records of the Ameri\u00ad can Medical Association show, and they are the most complete extant and based on official data, no man by the name of Dinshah P. Ghadiali was ever graduated by any reputable medical college or licensed to practice medicine in any state in the Union. One wonders whether Ghadiali's other \"degrees\" rested on as flimsy a foundation. In part of his advertising paraphernalia Ghadiati sent out reprints of a \"life sketch\" of himself, written in the third person, but claimed to be the \"most accurate report\" ever published. According to this, he was born in 1873 in India. When he was two and a half years old he attended primary school and was in high school when he was eight years old ! More marvelous still, at the tender age of eleven he \"acted as assistant to professor of mathematics and science at Wilson College, Bombay.\" When he was thirteen he took the Bombay University exami\u00ad nation and at fourteen he \"began the study of medicine.\" After that he was in succession a \"consulting electrical engineer,\" a \"medical of an \"Electro-Medical Hall\" for the treatment of disease by color waves \"and other drugless methods in conjunction with his regular medical and surgical practice.\" Subsequently he was an insurance agent, a newspaper publisher, the founder and chairman of a soft drink company, the vice-president and general manager of an \"Anti-Forgery Electric Pen Company,\" the assistant manager of a nut and fruit company, the manufacturer of the \"Dinshah Engine Tester,\" the organizer and president of \"Dr. Dinshah P. Ghadiati Inventions Corporation\" (which was to market sound motion pictures), the general manager of the \"Independent Electrical Supply,'' the founder of a \"Business Psychological Bureau\" and many other things too numerous to mention. Finally: \"Having perfected and completed one of his life works, Spectro-Chrome Therapy, his original method of treatment of diseases by attuned color waves, he founded the Spectro-Chrome Institute.\" \"Spectro-Chrome Therapy'! consisted in the \"restoration of the human Radio\u00ad Active and Radio-Emanative Equilibrium by Attuned Color Waves.\" This was the thesis developed and commercialized by Ghadiali : Every element exhibits a preponderance of one or more of the seven prismatic colors ; 97 per cent of our body is composed of the four elements, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon ; the preponderating color waves of these four elements are blue, red, green and yellow, respectively; the human body is responsive to these four \"color wave potencies.\" In health our four colors are properly balanced ; when they get out of balance we are diseased ; ergo, to cure disease administer the lacking colors or reduce the colors that have become too brilliant. Part of the Ghadia_li paraphernalia was a chart describing the \"Spectra-Chrome Therapeutic System.\" This chart stated that green light would kill germs and build muscles ; that yellow light would aid digestion, expel intestinal worms and build nerves ; that red light would energize the liver ; that violet light would depress the heart ; that lemon colored light would build bones ; that orange light would act as an emetic i that purple light was an anti-malarial. There was also another \"chart\" which divided the body into various areas, each of which had its own number. According to Ghadiali, Spectro-Chrome Therapy would \"meet every condition of ill health\" although he admitted its limitation in surgical cases. As Ghadiali wore powerful spectacles, one presumes also that attuned color waves are valueless for correcting errors of refraction. \"Spectra-Chrome Therapy,\" according to the Colonel, was \"suited for intelligent self-use.\" Such crude things as drugs \"quickly upset the nervo-vital balance of persons of high mental and spiritual development.\" The mental and spiritual high-brow who was feeling off-color was advised to purchase the \"Standard ---------~- -----------~----------- MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 153 Spectra-Chrome outfit.\" This could be obtained for $30 and consisted of a steel hood, a lamp bracket, an electric light bulb, 15 feet of cord, an attachment plug, and-mystery of mysteries-\"special attuned color slides, chart and full course of instructions.\" One learned further that this vade-mecum was \"obtainable direct from the inventor [Dinshah P. Ghadiali, \"M.D.,\" etc.] only.\"\u00b7 Thus did Ghadiali appeal to that vast field, the hypochondriac public. But he endeavored to reach with equal plausibility medical men and the followers of the \"drugless cults.\" Ghadiali went around the country giving \"intensive courses\" in \"Spectre-Chrome Therapy\" and attempted to tie up his disciples in much the same way as did Albert Abrams. Abrams, it will be remembered, leased his piece of electrical hocus-pocus, the \"Oscilloclast,\" only to those who would sign a contract not to open this hermetically sealed device. Ghadiali gave courses only to those who, in addition to paying $100 (cash in advance) would sign a statement they would never give out, print, or publish, either directly or indirectly, any of the notes taken during the course, nor any part of the \"instructions, charts, diagrams, processes and the like.\" Of coutse, there was a \"diploma\" granted at the end of the \"course\" and the disciple was entitled to call himself a \"Spectro\u00ad Chrome Therapist\" and put after his name the magic letters \"S.C.T.\" The complete course occupied two weeks of six days each. No visitors were admitted \"without special permission in each case and even then only once.\" As a business man, Ghadiali ranked high. One learned that \"bulbs, charts and similar supplies may be had for cash\" and Ghadiali emphasized that his institute did not maintain a credit department, that all transactions were net cash with order and that the Institute's responsibility ceased with shipment. He said further that while personal checks would be accepted \"the orders do not go out [Italics in the original.-A. J. C.] until the checks are cashed and payment received through the banks.\" . In December 1925 Ghadiali's activities received a setback when he was sentenced to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta for violation of the Mann Act. As soon as he was released, however, he went back to \"Spectre-Chrome Therapy.\" A cult to be successful must have plausibility. It should have some apparent scientific basis. The Spectre-Chrome fad played on the public's ignorance of light therapy. The layman has hazy notions of the use of ultraviolet and infra-red rays in medicine. The public knows, too, that heliotherapy has an established\u00ad although limited-place in the scientific treatment of certain diseased conditions. The characteristic spectra of the individual elements also are matters of more or less general knowledge. What more plausible, then, to those possessing that small knowledge that is dangerous, that human pathology is due to a lack of balance in the alleged \"color wave potencies\"-whatever that may mean. Those who wonder why so much space has been devoted to Ghadiali, should realize that helpless but credulous patients suffering from such serious conditions as syphilitic conjunctivitis, ovaritis, diabetes mellitus, pulmonary tuberculosis and chronic gonorrhea were \"treated\" with colored 1ights.-(Co11densed and modified from The Journal A. M. A., Jan. 26, 1924.) A. E. G. Hall.-Alfred Ernest Edward George Hall is said to have been born in London in 1892 and to have been brought to Canada by his parents when he was a year old. He apparently acquired Canadian citizenship. Hall, not content with having most of the l,etters of the alphabet conferred on him at birth before his name, procured out of the vasty deep such imposing titles to put after his name as \"M.D., Ps.D.; M.Sc.D., B.A., F.Ps.A., B.L.\" and possibly some others. The man was not a physician, never attended any reputable medical school, nor was he ever licensed to practice medicine anywhere in the United States or Canada. Hall worked the quack psychology scheme both in the United States and in Canada. 154 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS A few years ago Hall claimed under oath that he held a degree in medicine granted by the McKechnie School oi Medicine of Victoria, B. C., in 1916. There never was such an institution. Hall also claimed to have attended \"Bailie College\" of the University of London for three years and to have obtained the degree of B.A. at that institution. There never was a Bailie College, and Hall was never graduated by the University of London. Hall also claimed, during one of the numerous times that he was under arrest, that from 1916 to 1918 he was the Executive Director of the Belgian War Orphans' Relief for the Dominion of Canada. This also was a story made up out of whole cloth. During the various times that Hall came to the United States, he called him\u00ad self a \"consulting psychologist.\" When he was in Chicago he posed as a specialist of London, Paris, Geneva and Vienna-and possibly points east-and discoursed on \"Sex and Civilization.\" In fact, sex has been Mr. Hall's forte. At one time when Hall was in Toronto, the weekly publication Saturday Night of that city described Hall as a \"sexual quack\" who was giving \"utterly filthy and unscientific discourses on sexual subjects.\" He gave the same sort of stuff in the United States, and the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association received from some persons who were present at his talks statements declaring that Hall showed \"a sadistic tendency.\" For some time Hall operated at Richmond, Ind., where he was said to have created a fake organization called the \"American Academy of Psychological Research\" and to have appointed himself \"Dean\" of the \"Academy\" I The thing, of course, had not the slightest educational standing ; it had connected with it a motley group of faddists, fakers or quacks. It distributed degrees lavishly. Curiously enough, most of the attendants at this so-called Academy hailed from eastern Canada. Hall's police record was as follows: 1923-Vancouver; arrested for obtaining credit under false pretenses. Sentence suspended. 1924-Vancouver; arrested for conspiring to defraud. Case dismissed. Again arrested, charged with obtaining money under false pretenses and sentenced to six months at hard labor in Oakalla Prison. 1925-Vancouver; arrested for obtaining money under false pretenses. Sentenced to twelve days, Again arrested for obtaining money under false pretenses and sent to jail. 1926-Cbicago; arrested on charge of operating a confidence game and obtaining money under false pretenses; fined and sentenced to six months in the House of Correction. 1-927-Cbicago; arrested for practicing medicine without a license. Charge nolle prossed for lack of prosecution. At the same time Hall was taken into custody by the United States authorities as an alien who bad violated the Immigation Act. He was given hearing and deported. 1928-Toronto; arrested on the charge of vagrancy; charge withdrawn, as be bad money in his pocket. 1930-Toronto; arrested for swindling the Royal York Hotel out of about $1,100; sentenced to six months in the Ontario Reformatory. 1932--Cleveland; arrested by the police department and again deported to Canada. 1933-Toronto; arrested and found guilty of theft. Sentenced to two years in the Kingston Penitentiary. Hall's escapade in Toronto in 1930 consisted of running up bills at two of the leading hotels. He was convicted and sentenced to the Ontario Reformatory. When he was released, he started a new scheme and in 1933 was again put on trial in Toronto on charge of theft. In this trial, Hall acted as his own attorney and told the jury that he was a much-abused man. The judge in charging the jury warned them not to allow themselves to be carried away by Hall's \"frenzied eloquence.\" They did not. They sentenced Hall to two years in the Kingston Penitentiary. ----------- ... -.--.. -.-\u00b7--\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7-\u00b7-\u00b7-\u00b7------------. \u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7 \u00b7\u00b7--~-----------..

He claimed to have :i,,eei;i one of those sentenced by the penitentiary authorities to be paddled, but unfortfinately it appears that the sentence was not carried out.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., May 18, 1935.) William Howard Hay.-According to the records of the American Medical Association, William Howard Hay was born in 1866 and was graduated by the Medical Department of the University of the City of New York in 1891. He was licensed in Pennsylvania and New York. In 1927 there was organized in East Aurora, N. Y., a concern known as the East Aurora Sun and Diet Sanatorium which was said to be \"devoted to the removal of the cause of disease through the natural means of proper food and regulated exposure to the sun.\" The institution was incorporated by non-medical men and Dr. Hay was made medical adviser. Sometime between 1929 and 1932, Dr. Hay and those who controlled the East Aurora Sun and Diet Sanatorium parted company and in August 1932 a Penn- W'!, IIOW.uD KAY, IUI., 11 ..... - -Ollcn IAHA\\1101.A.JI.V) Facsimile (reduced) of the letter-heads used at East Aurora when Dr. Hay was \"Medical Director,\" sylvania paper reported that Dr. Hay and some hotel men had purchased the Mount Pleasant House at Mount Pocono and would open it under the name \"Pocono Hay-ven.\" It appears also from the item that Dr. Hay brought with him the man who had been the business manager of the East Aurora institution. In December 1932 newspapers reported that William Howard Hay had been named defendant in the federal civil court at Scranton in an action that was filed by the Sun-Diet Sanatorium, Inc., of East Aurora, N. Y. It appears that Dr. Hay was charged with breaking his contract and an injunction was asked against his activities at Mount Pocono. Dr. Hay and his co-defendants were sued for $200,000 and the courts were invoked to restrict Hay from using the methods of the East Aurora concern. At this point, it is of interest to note that Dr. Hay's successor in East Aurora was Dr. Rasmus Larrsen Alsaker whose activities in other fields are dealt with elsewhere in this book. But getting back to Dr. Hay: Dr. Hay's magnum' opus was his book \"Health via Food.\" The thesis developed in the book, briefly stated, seems to have been that all pathologic states are due to errors in diet and \"deficient drainage\"-the latter phrase accredited to William Arbuthnot Lane, who seems to have been one of Dr. Hay's tutelary divinities. To overcome the \"deficient drainage,\" Dr. Hay's book suggests the use of \"Pluto Water\" and a change in the dietary habits of the patient. \"Acidosis,\" of course, looms large, and the Hay book states that there 156 . MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS is a definite \"connection between acid-forming foods and disease.\" Thus, in the chapter on \"The Role of Food\": \"Food is a direct cause. of disease because it is the only source through which we can create these acids, If acid causes diseases, as there is not the slightest doubt, and if acid can come from nothing but food, then food is the one and the only cause of disease, and how can we escape such conclusion?\" As we used to say when we studied Euclid: Q. E. D. There are, according to the Hay philosophy, four causes of acidosis: (1) The use of too much con\u00ad centrated protein; (2) the use of \"refined, processed, denatured, bleached, preserved,\u00b7 adulterated\" foods, chiefly of the carbohydrate group; (3) the combining of proteins and carbohydrates; (4) the retention in the colon of food residues beyond twenty-four hours following their ingestion. Nearly every food faddist develops the obsession that proteins and carbohydrates should not be eaten at the same time, because, forsooth, proteins need acid for their digestion, while carbohydrates call for alkaline digestive juices. The fallacy is based on that little knowledge that is dangerous. Those who fall into it apparently conceive the human stomach as a large, open bag into which food drops, or is passed down, through the esophagus. Just how the exponents of the theory that carbohydrates and proteins should not be eaten together can get around the fact that probably most of the common foodstuffs contain both proteins and carbohydrates, together with a certain proportion of fats, has never been explained. Fasting was another of the panaceas suggested by Dr. Hay and he records the case of one patient whom he claims to have had under his care and who went without food for 55 days and lost 60 pounds. The patient, a woman, was alJeged to have continued her usual household duties, getting meals for the family and \"preparing the usual savory dishes.\" Let those who can, believe that this woman ate nothing for 55 days. Dr. Hay, as would be expected, was an anti-vivisectionist and has been adver\u00ad tised as opposed to vaccination. In his book, Dr. Hay stated that smallpox is nothing but \"an effort to throw off waste matter,\" Just how long Dr. Hay stayed at Pocono Hay-ven is not clear, but in 1934 he had apparently left Pennsylvania and was conducting an institution at Briarcliff Manor, N. Y.-(Condenscd and modified from The Jounial A. M. A., Feb. 25, 1933.) William Held.-This Chicago physician, according to the records of the A. M. A., was born in Austria in 1871 and in 1902 was graduated by Jenner Medical College which went out of existence in 1917. He was licensed to practice medicine in Illinois. Practically nothing was heard of Dr. Held until the spring of 1916, at the time the World War was at its height. Then he seems to have obtained his first publicity in a Chicago newspaper of April I-suggestive date I According to the news item, Dr. Held had discovered a substitute for skin-grafting in \"skin\u00ad dusting.\" Two days later the same paper had an article dealing with what was, apparently Held's first adventure into the field of nostrum exploitation-an alleged serum for the cure of epilepsy: \"Serum Robs Epilepsy of Its Horrors, Says Dr. Held.\" There was, then, a lull of a few months, but on October 13 Dr. Held was given another piece of preliminary newspaper publicity, under the heading \"Epilepsy Cure to Be Shown on 100 Patie11ts.\" This item was the forerunner of an article that appeared the next day in the same paper. It appeared that Held was on the program of one of the \"twilight-zone\" organizations, the \"Chicago Society of Medical Research,\" and, apparently, was getting too much publicity for some of the other active members to stomach, for the newspaper headed the article on Held MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 157 \"Doctors Halt Epileptic Test on 2 Rabbits.\" Held was shut off, apparently, because another member of the same organization had a \"cancer serum\" and still another had a \"prism cure\" for goiter and diabetes, while a third had his \"Auto\u00ad Hemic Serum\"-all of them anxious to demonstrate. On April 30, 1918 Held got some publicity when he wired President Wilson that he had just completed a two-months' experiment and discovered an antidote for \"gassing.\" He was quoted as stating: \"The discovery I have made will replenish the red blood corpuscles which are destroyed by the gas attacks of the Hun.\" In February 1919 a Chicago newspaper carried an article on William Held headed \"Doctor Claims Serum Will Cure Shell Shock,\" while another Chicago paper on August 25 of the same year recorded that Held was going to Europe to \"pursue medical research\" and headed the article \"Vaccine to Cure Epilepsy.\" In the latter part of 1922 Dr. Held received a feature write-up. At this time Held was working in the \"rejuvenation\" field. The article carried a picture of Held holding a laboratory monkey and stating that he (Held) had drawn from chim\u00ad panzees \"an elixir of youth\" which, when injected into the aged, resulted in reju\u00advenation-or, as the heading put it: \"Eighty Frisks Like Twenty After Doc Pumps Anti-Age Serum Into 'Em.\" In 1923 the chimpanzee story appeared again in various papers and a New York newspaper of July 12, that year, printed an interview with Dr. Held who was just sailing for Berlin and who was said to have told the reporter that he was rejuvenating old people with his \"Cholin Splitter.\" When Held returned in Sep\u00ad tember, two New York papers printed interviews with Held, the gist of which may be indicated by the heading: \"Sees Man Mere Infant at 100 by Freeing Sys\u00ad tem of Cholin.\" In 1924 there appeared another feature story quoting Held as stating that \"Glands deep within the bodies of Leopold and Loeb made them capable of the murder of Robert Franks.\" .By 1927 Held had joined those who have found a cheap way to notoriety by charging that aluminum pots, pans and kettles are the cause of cancer I In 1929 Dr. Held obtained more publicity by appearing for the \"anti-vivisectionists\" in the hearings on a so-called Anti-Vivisection Bill before the Illinois legislature. In the newspaper reports Held was described as \"Professor of Medicine, well known for his treatment of epilepsy.\" While the brief sketch just given of Held's unpaid publicity gives a general idea of this man's professional activities, it does not, by any means, give all of them. Much could be written regarding paid advertising: First, of Dr. Held's alleged serum for epilepsy; later, of his home-remedy substitute for the serum which he called \"Antiepilepticoid\"; still later, of the half-page newspaper advertisements in Chicago papers in which he was described as the \"Director\" of the imposingly named \"International Institute Laboratory and Clinic, Inc.,\" an organization that seems to have been known earlier as the \"International Institut~\" and \"International Health Institute.\" Space might also be given to Held's \"Epileptographic Society of America\" and his \"United States Health League,\" finally coming down to his panacea \"Iodoheld.\" From Dr. Held's advertsing, it appeared that Iodoheld was \"Iodized, Aqueous Rare Earth Metal Solution.\" The \"rare earth\" in this connection seemed to be cerium. According to Held, \"Iodoheld\" : \" . . . has demonstrated its efficiency to successfully annihilate disease-producing micro-organism in the body, eliminate their products, heal inflammation, detoxinate and antisepticize tissues and body fluids, stimulate healthy granulation of pathologically changed organs, reduce fever by combating its cause and destroy tumors.\" It was said elsewhere in Dr. Held's ballyhoo material, \"Iodoheld has proven bewilderingly effective\"; 11bewilderingly\" seemed justified 1 Not that Iodoheld was the only preparation that Dr. Held had for sale; he had, it appeared, certain 158 MISCELLANEOUS P RACTJTIONERS \"gland products\" (\"ask for literature\"). Dr. Held's price month's glandular material, prepared according to patient's history, $16.\" His lodoheld came \u00b7 in sealed glass vials, each containing 1\u00bc cc.; price $2.50. From the advertising booklet, it appeared that Iodoheld had not only performed marvels in Europe but in America had cured infantile paralysis, prostatitis, pericarditis, epididyrnitis, ovarian tumor, eczema, and, most marvelous of all, the common cold! Then, Dr. Held also had his product \"Hormogene\" which was \"administered in the male for gonadal deficiency\" and to \"the female after surgical exposure of the arteries supplying the organs to be treated.\" One treatment came at $151 There was also Dr. Held's \"Calcrefer\" which was said to be a \"Calcium creosote iron compound for intravenous administration.\" In January 1936 Dr. Held was exploiting, in addition to Iodoheld, a \"gland compound\" called \"Endotens.\" From what has been written, it is not difficult to evaluate the probable scientific worth of Dr. Reid's statements relative to the cancer-producing potentialities of aluminum pots and pans and his opinions on the lack of any r.eed for animal experimentation.-(Conde11sed from The Jo,mial A. M. A., April 27, 1929, with additions.) Horace D. Reynolds.-This man, with associates, operated advertising medical concerns in various large cities-Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Detroit, etc. They were advertised as \"Research Laboratories.\" Reynolds' name figured in Chicago papers in other capacities than that of advertiser. In 1906 he was reported to have been arrested on charges of operating a confidence game and threats of doing bodily injury. In 1913 Chicago papers recorded his arrest on the charge of using the mails to defraud. It was estimated that Reynolds had swindled the public of more than half a million dollars. His case was repeatedly continued, but finally came to trial three years after his arrest, at which time Reynolds pleaded guilty and was fined a paltry $100 and costs. In 1921 Reynolds was in Nashville, Tenn., advertising a \"blood cell serum\" recommended for innu\u00ad merable ailments. In August 1922 a Michigan paper reported the death of a woman following an \"injection of serum.\" The story was that the woman had come to Chicago to visit friends and, because she had lost weight and was attracted by a Reynolds advertisement, submitted to an injection of the \"serum.\" In Sep\u00ad tember 1922 a young man from Gary Ind., reported that his father had seen a Reynolds advertisement in a Chicago paper and had come to Chicago to take treat\u00ad ments. He took four of them at $10 a treatment. Four hours after the fourth treatment was taken, the man was dead. The coroner of Gary reported that follow\u00ad ing a necropsy he was of the opinion that the Reynolds injection was the cause of the man's death. In 1926 the Chicago Tribune published an expose of Reynolds that caused the man to cease advertising in that city. In February 1927 the Buffalo Better Business Bureau published a report on Reynolds' \"Buffalo Research Laboratory.\" Soon thereafter the Reynolds Buffalo outfit went out of business. The responsibility for such quacks as Reynolds lies primarily on those states which fail to revoke the quacks' licenses. Next to negligent state officials, the responsibility lies with newspapers that will accept the quack's advertising.-(C01tde11sed from The Journal A. M. A., Nov. 19, 1927.) Horace lppelthwaite (\"Dr. Daniel Davenport\").-A motion picture entitled \"Jungle Hazards\" and described as the \"Wildest Wild Animal Motion Picture Ever Filmed\" that depicted \"the Love Life of Cannibals\" was shown in various parts of the United States. It was claimed that fifteen human lives had been lost in its making and the film was alleged to have been taken by \"Dr. Daniel Davenport, M.D., Ph.D., F.Z.S.,\" who appeared in person at the showing of the film. At the showings an elaborate \"Souvenir Booklet\" was sold which carried MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 159 what was represented as \"a complete description of the tragic expedition survived only by Dr. Daniel Davenport.\" As a final artistic touch, the \"Souvenir Booklet\" was \"Personally Autographed by the Explorer.\" \"Davenport's\" picture adorned the booklet, showing the gentleman rigged out in the most approved African\u00ad explorer style-pith helmet, puggree, briar pipe, etc. There was no Daniel Davenport. The man's real name was Horace lppelthwaite.

Below: Reduced facsimile of one of numerous advertisements appearing in Chicago papers at the time of Davenport's visit to that city. that he was a graduate of McGill University. No man by the name of either Daniel Davenport or of Horace lpp'elthwaite was ever a student in or graduated by McGill University. lppelthwaite also claimed that he bad held a commission as lieutenant in the Royal Medical Corps. The British War Office reported that they had no record of either Daniel Davenport or Horace lppelthwaite as ever having been a member of His Majesty's forces. lppelthwaite claimed too, in his booklet, that a famous Belgian bacteriologist, Dr. Louis Neuman, had been chosen by the Belgian Society of Bacteriology to conduct a survey in the Congo and that Dr. Neuman had chosen as one of his aides, Daniel Davenport. Investigation disclosed that there apparently never was a Dr. Louis Neuman nor a Societe Bacteriologie de Belgique. 160 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS The Davenport advertising also claimed that the film \"Jungle Hazards\" had been endorsed by the Maryland Academy of Sciences, by the Western Reserve University and by the Boy Scouts of America. All these claims were false. When \"Davenport\" was working a similar scheme in Boston, showing a motion picture entitled \"Jango, with Dr. Davenport and Cannibals in Person,\" the Boston Better Business Bureau exposed the spuriousness of the scheme. \"Davenport\" not only appeared in person in Boston but showed \"two faithful cannibal tribesmen\" that he had brought to the United States. One of these \"cannibals\" was reported by the Boston Better Business Bureau to have brought suit against the Davenport outfit for back wages. The \"cannibal\" in his suit explained that he was a janitor from Harlem, that the motion picture was not produced in the African jungle but was manufactured largely from lengths of various jungle films combined with pictures of a small animal circus set up in the Bronx 1-(Conde,ised from Tlie Journal A. M. A., Oct. 17, 1931.) Alzamon Ira Lucas.-This man, who put after his name the letters \"Psy.D., Ph.D.,\" described himself as an 11Educator-Scientist-Lecturer,\" as the discoverer of \"Predetermination of Sex and Prevocation of the Human Species,\" and as the founder of such organizations as \"American Foundation,\" \"American Home Betterment Association\" and \"American Drugless Association.\" In 1928 Lucas was convicted of grand larceny and sentenced to serve from two to four years in prison. Lucas figured in police reports at various times during his career. According to newspaper reports, Lucas was a negro although he is said to have denied this and to have claimed that he had Cherokee Indian, Dutch, French, Hindu and Spanish blood in his veins. During a libel suit in which Lucas was involved in Portland, Oregon, there were reported to have been introduced (1) a birth certifi\u00ad cate recording him as a negro; (2) evidence to show that he was ordained a minister in the Tabernacle Baptist Church (colored) in Los Angeles, and (3) evi\u00ad dence that his first marriage took place in Cheyenne, being performed by a colored clergyman in a colored church before colored witnesses I A resume of Lucas' career, reported to have been introduced in the Portland trial, was said to show that in 1889 he was a bellboy in a San Francisco hotel; from 1890 to 1893 he was giving \"mind readings\" and sleight of hand performances in California mining towns ; from 1893 to 1895 he was a janitor; from 1897 to 1899 he was an itinerant entertainer in small towns in California, Nevada, Oregon and Washingtl)n, and was even at that time running \"sex-problem lectures\" in addition to his other stunts. In 1900 he was a barber in Washington and a year later was a barnstormer in Hoyle's Magic Show, later becoming an itinerant entertainer and \"psychologist.\" In 1902 he established himself as a healer in Bozeman, Mont., and in Denver, Colo., where he founded the \"Limitless Life Society,\" which held that a man could live a thousand years. He practiced \"mental healing\" in Nampa, Idaho, and Pendleton, Ore., and in the latter town was arrested on a criminal libel charge. In Seattle, he was fined for violation of the medical practice act. After his vicissitudes in other American cities, Lucas finally settled upon Rochester, New York, as headquarters for the creation of the \"American Super\u00ad Race Foundation.\" Therein he showed poor judgment. As an expert in pre\u00ad determination Lucas made the fundamental error of locating in a city that had a very active health officer, Dr. George W. Goler, and a Better Business Bureau with an up-and-coming manager, Mr. F. M. Willson. Largely due to the activities of Dr. Goler and Mr. Willson, with, of course, the help of an efficient police department, Lucas was given the opportunity of two to four years' study, unham-MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 161 pered with the economic necessity of making a living, while in retirement in Auburn prison. Alzamon Ira Lucas was indicted on the complaint of a woman who charged that he defrauded her of $250, by falsely representing he could cure her of lung trouble and \"awaken life within her.\" Lucas fought the indictment until June 1928, when he was placed on trial at Buffalo, under a change of venue. The jury returned a verdict of \"guilty\" after thirty minutes' deliberation and sentenced him to serve from two to four years in prison.-(Condeused from The Journal A. M.A . ., advertisement. In the original this occupied a full page of Physical Culture for January, 1931. Earle Liederman.-This man was one of the bare-torso, big-muscle persons \u00b7whose advertising might be expected to lead a puny store-clerk to believe that by purchasing the Liederman \"course\" he would become a second Sandow. Liederman got his contacts by advertisements in not-too-particular magazines. In March 1930 the Federal Trade Commission charged Liederman with unfair methods of com\u00ad petition. After a hearing in which testimony was heard and evidence received, the Commission reported that Liederman had for some years conducted a corre\u00ad spondence school for physical culture, selling his \"lessons\" or \"courses of instruc-162 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS tion\" together with books and pamphlets and also certain appliances to be used in following out the instructions. The first price asked by Liederman was $37. Those who hesitated to swallow the bait received a series of letters which, when the seventh came, offered the \"course\" for $19. The Commission showed that while Liederman led his victims to believe that in the seventh letter they were being given a special price which would have to be accepted in a given time, the facts were that Liederman would accept offers to enroll or purchase regardless of any time limitation. The Commission also showed that the claim that each pupil would be given individual instruction was quite false and the \"courses\" were mimeographed for general use. In February 1931 the Commission ordered Lieder\u00ad man to cease and desist from the misrepresentation that they had proven.-(Con\u00ad densed from The Journal A. M.A., May 30, 1931.) Paul 0. Sampson.-For some years this man went about the country giving talks on dietetics and nutrition. Sampson styled himself a \"Food Specialist\" and claimed to represent the \"National Health League, Inc.\" and also the \"Natural Food Institute.\" Investigation failed to show that either of these imposingly named organizations existed elsewhere than on paper. Sampson, in getting his speaking dates, utilized various civic clubs, women's clubs and similar organizations. Like most individuals in the diet fad field, Sampson retailed the nonsense regarding the alleged harmfulness of white flour and bread made from it. Nevertheless, Sampson seemed to be open to conviction for in 1929, when a \"Better Homes, Better Health Exposition\" was held in Scranton, Pa., Sampson, who had some connection with this so-called exposition, was alleged to have accepted $25 from a baker who wished to have an exhibit devoted exclusively to white bread. It was reported that one of Sampson's schemes was to get some civic club to sponsor him in a town in organizing a cooking school in-which he would enroll as many women as posible at $5 apiece; that in these classes he would attempt to create a demand for a special brand of whole wheat bread, at the same time going to the local bakers and offering to sell them a formula by which they could make the bread which he was describing. One of the most surprising social phenomena of American city life is the ease with which self-seeking faddists and fakers in various fields can obtain entree to platforms before various civic organizations. It is this lack of discrimination that makes it possible . for persons with no scientific background to pose as authorities on health and nutrition and make an easy living by their wits.-( C 011densed from The Journal A. M. A., July 12, 1930.) Curtis Howe Springer.-In 1929 this person was giving alleged lectures said to be \"under the auspices of the Extension Department of Greer College.\" Greer College was a Chicago concern that taught automobile mechanics. In August 1930 the Better Business Bureau of Scranton, Pa., reported that Springer was giving a course of lectures at the local Y. M. C. A. which was said to be presented through the courtesy of the \"Extension Department of the National Academy.\" This \"academy\" was probably as unreal as the \"Springer School of Humanism,\" also used by Springer as an advertising asset. Springer's \"lectures\" at Scranton were entitled \"How to Banish Disease and Know the Joy of Living.\" The \"lectures\" were free, but collections were taken up and Springer was said to have used them as a come-on for selling so-called private courses in psychoanalysis at $25 a course. In 1930, also, Springer put out the first issue of a magazine entitled Symposiu-m Creative Psychologic, a name that was as meaningless as some of Springer's other titles. This sheet was devoted mainly to advertising Springer and his \"Doc. Springer Temple of Health.\" MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 163 At this point it may be interpolated that investigation seems to show that : Springer came originally from Birmingham, Ala., where his record, not being of a medical or quasi-medical character, need not be gone into; he left there to come to Chicago; he organized a \"Temple of Health\" in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. ; he sold \"Springer's Health Bread\" at J ohnstownJ Pa. ; he exploited a similar scheme in Cumberland, Md. ; he made payments on some land at Mount Dayis, The Body Beautiful By CURTIS HOWE SPRINGER M.

Springer, in advertising himself, has placed after his name the letters \"M.D., N .D., D.O., Ph.D.,'' sometimes with the statement beneath the \"degrees\" that they 164 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS were \"Honorarily conferred.\" A most thorough search fails to show that Springer was ever graduated by any reputable college or university, medical or otherwise. In the latter part of December 1933 the broadcasting station, WGN, operated by the Chicago Trib,me, called up the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association and asked for, and received, such information as was then available on Curtis Howe Springer. It appeared that Springer wanted to buy time on the air over WGN, but the contract he offered was rejected. A few days later (Jan. 4, 1934) Springer himself, with the effrontery of his kind, came to the headquarters of the American Medical Association and asked to see the author of this book, who was then Director of the Bureau of Investigation. He told the Director that he had called to correct what he described as certain misconceptions that the Bureau of Investigation was said to have regarding him. The Director asked Springer where he had obtained, and by what right he used, the degree M.D. Springer replied that the \"degree\" had been bestowed by a chiropractor of New Jersey, who operated several institutions of dubious educa\u00ad tional character. Needless to say, the concern granting the Springer \"degree\" was not a medical college, had no scientific standing and, of course, had no legal authority whatever to grant the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Springer further admitted during the interview that this alleged degree was granted without attend\u00ad ance and upon the payment of either $200 or $300 (he said he could not remember which) and the answering of certain questions I At the time of the interview, Springer was told that verbal statements were unsatisfactory and he was asked to send to the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association a letter setting forth the various facts regarding himself and correcting any alleged inaccuracies of which the Bureau had been accused. Springer stated _that he would go right back to his hotel (one of the most expensive in Chicago) and write such a letter. At the same time, the Director of the Bureau of Investigation wrote to Springer at his Chicago hotel recapitulating the claims that Springer had just made. Springer was asked to confirm by letter his verbal claim that he bought his M.D. \"degree\" from the chiropractic concern. He was asked also from what institutions a,nd on what dates he had received his \"degrees\" of D.O. and Ph.D.; he was asked whether the Greer College of which he had been advertised as Dean was the same concern that had been the subject of a cease and desist order from the Federal Trade Commission; he was asked to furnish also, as he had verbally promised, written evidence that would show that he had some knowledge of nutrition and dietetics. Of course Springer was much too shrewd to write any such \u00b7 letter and to put in black and white answers to any of the questions which were put to him. In July 1934 Springer, because of complaints that had come to the Chicago Better Business Bureau and because of warrants that had been taken out for him charging him with slander, visited the Chicago Better Business Bureau for the alleged purpose of giving information regarding the complaints. To quote from the Better Business Bureau's report on Springer's visit: \"When asked about his qualifications as a medical doctor, Springer said that be took his degree of M.D. from the American College of Doctors and Surgeons in Washington, D. C. [There is no such institution.-A. J. C.] He took his degree of osteopathy at Meyersdale, Pa., where he maintained a residence. [There never has been an osteopathic college therc.-A. J. C.] He states that he attended the Westlake West Virginia College for one year. [There is no such college and never bas been-A. J. C.], and further, that he took his degree of Ph.D. from a New Jersey school of osteopathy. When it was called to his attention that a school of osteopathy did not confer such a degree as Ph.D., Springer did not answer the question.\" Springer was also said to have admitted to the officials of the Better Business Bureau that in 1933 he made $76,000 in the sale of his products-Antediluvian Tea, Re-Hib, etc. Soon after his interview with the Chicago Better Business Bureau, MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 165 Springer left Chicago and went back to Pennsylvania. About that time, the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory was asked to analyze Springds Re-Hib. After completing their analysis, the chemists reported that the stuff was approximately three-fourths baking soda to which had been added some chalk, \u00b7 magnesia and bismuth subcarbonate. Springer's Antediluvian Tea was apparently nothing more than a crude mixture of laxative herbs.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Sept. 14, 1935.) Robert Thompson.-On Jan. 19, 1929, this man, who held a diploma from the Baltimore Medical College, 1895, was sentenced in Special Sessions Court, New York City, to one year in the penitentiary and the payment of a fine of $500. Thompson's career had been one that cast almost as much reflection on the state\u00ad using the word state in its broader sense-as it did on the individual. Thompson was born in New Hampshire in 1873 of a respected New England family. He was known to the police from the Atlantic to the Pacific under at least half a dozen aliases: \"Dr. James Grant,\" \"Dr. Hudson,\" \"Dr. Robert Malcolm,\" etc. In 1903 Thompson was living in Boston and was said to have maintained an office where, according to the police, he carried on illegal operations under the name of 11Dr. J. H. Roberts.\" At the same time Thompson was said to have furnished the money and brains for a group of counterfeiters that were flooding the country with spurious five, ten and twenty-dollar bills. As a result he was convicted in 1905 of making and passing counterfeit money. He appealed and was allowed his freedom under $5,000 bail, on condition that he report every alternate day at the United States Marshal's office. Before long he was again in trouble, for his French Medical Company, which was said to have been an abortion mill, was investigated by the Post Office Department and the \"noted French specialist\" behind the concern was found to be Thompson, who worked under various aliases. Before the French Medical Company's case came to trial, the United States Court of Appeals had sustained the sentence of the lower court in the counterfeiting case and Thompson went to the Federal penitentiary. Through the efforts of his relatives the Department of Justice was petitioned and, early in 1908, President Taft paroled the man. In 1910, under the alias \"Dr. James Grant,\" Thompson was running an abortion mill in San Francisco. One of his victims, a young girl, died in Thompson's \"sanatorium.\" Thompson cut up the body, transported it in a trunk, and buried it in the basement of a cottage that he had rented for that purpose, after pouring acid over the remains. As a result, Thompson was indicted for murder, convicted, and sentenced to twenty years in San Quentin Prison. He served only nine years of his sentence, when he was paroled to the custody of his father in September 1919. He went back again to Boston where once more he established an abortion business, practicing under the alias \"Stanton A. Hudson.\" In August 1922 he was arrested on the charge of procuring an abortion, but was discharged. In December of the same year he was sentenced to three months in jail on. the charge of violating the state medical practice act. In February 1923 he was again rearrested, charged with advising and prescribing instruments to procure abortion, but was not convicted. Thompson then went to New York City, and in September 1927, while prac\u00ad ticing under the name of \"Robert Malcolm,\" was charged with attempted abortion and the possession of narcotics. The case was dismisse~ by a local magistrate and Thompson was said to have boasted openly that he could beat any police case because he had the \"pull.\" Finally, a New York tabloid turned one of its reporters loose on the Thompson case and, with the aid of the publicity thus given, plus the 166 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS activities of the chief of the legal bureau of the Department of Health of the City of New York-Dr. S. Dana Hubbard-and the Assistant District Attorney, Michad A. Ford, finally brought Thompson to trial with the result already related. From the testimony it appeared that Thompson saw about thirty patients a week and that he had nine cots in his institution, where women stayed overnight following the insertion of a catheter into the uterus, a curettage being done on the following morning. Putting aside the purely medical aspects of the case, the outstanding thing that must strike every good citizen in this recital of sordid facts was the failure on the part of the forces of law and order properly to control an individual whose record for a quarter of a century was one of major crime. Next to this, the recital brings out the further fact-more encouraging-that publicity, when backed with action of officials who are persistent and incorruptible, can bring the most insolent and self-confident criminal to justice.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M.A., Feb. 16, 1929.) Rudolph von Walden.-This man, who styled himself \"professor,\" was dis\u00ad tinctly up-stage. He had presence, poise and a distinguished appearance even when he was \"mugged\" by the police. His gray and luxuriant whiskers, parted meticulously in the middle, must in themselves have been a commercial asset of no mean worth. Von Walden was not a physician nor licensed to practice medicine anywhere. He was not and never had been a professor in any reputable scientific institution. He was not even a chiropractor, naturopath, seventh-son-of-seventh-son nor a member of any of the fifty-seven varieties of cults that infest the American scene. Yet newspapers reported that he was estimated to take in between $6,000 and $10,000 weekly and had a personal fortune of over half a million dollars. Walden dubbed himself a \"scientist.\" He and his sons brought into being a number of \"Walden Institutes\" in different parts of the country. These were operated in Cincinnati, New Haven and Hartford, Conn., New York City, Newark, N. J., Atlanta, Ga., and St. Albans, L. I. Some of Rudolph's sons seem to have been interesting persons, according to the newspaper files. One, who for a time conducted the Hartford, Conn. Walden Institute, was reported to have sued his own father for alienating the affections of his (the son's) wife. Another son, Sherman, a chiropractor, conducted an \"institute\" in Atlanta, Ga. A third son was variously described in the crime news of the newspapers as the \"Metropole Bandit\" and the \"Flappers' Friend.\" Rudolph von Walden was reported to have been found guilty of practicing medicine without a license in Portsmouth, Ohio as long ago as 1916. He was fined $300 and costs and sentenced to a year's imprisonment, the latter to be sus\u00ad pended on condition that he get out of the state. In 1917 Alabama papers reported that Rudolph had been arrested in Mobile. In 1921 Florida papers reported that Rudolph von Walden had been arrested in St. Petersburg. Richmond, Va. papers in 1924 also reported Rudolph's arrest. The latter arrest had an interesting out\u00ad come. According to the report, von Walden was held on two charges, (1) that of practicing medicine without a license and (2) that of having illegally in his possession three quarts of whisky. The Richmond police said at the time that von Walden evidently had some \"influence behind him in the state of Georgia\" as he was able to get in touch with a Georgia bank which immediately sent him $1,000. When von Walden's case was called, it was dismissed. According to newspaper reports, no evidence was brought to show that he practiced medicine and, further, the \"professor\" convinced the court that the three quarts of whisky found in his possession were \"being used in connection with his professional work I\" MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 167 P&C&1W'Dffft'D-I PARALYSIS DUE TO HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE1;\u00b7~:t::::]=~ Many a Promising Career Cut Short by Paralyaia.

In it von Walden describes himself as a \"scientist\" and his scheme as \"the most successful method in cxistencel\" In 1930 Rudolph went to Hartford, Conn., but the Better Business Bureau of that city had him arrested and von Walden was fined $200 and costs. Rudolph's methods were to publish expensive advertisements, many of them occupying full pages of such newspapers as would accept that sort of advertising. One of his slogans was that he had discovered how to conquer heart trouble and how to cure angina pectoris. Those who answered von Walden's advertisements received plausible come-on letters with \"consultation blanks\" which were to be filled 168 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS out and returned to von Walden. Then Rudolph was supposed to send the pros\u00ad pective victim a written \"analysis\" of his symptoms. The \"analyses\" were sur\u00ad prisingly uniform. Practically all of them read : \"I find upon examination that the origin of your symptoms is in your abdominal organs: your stomach, your liver, your intestines, and also your abdominal circulation. These must be corrected first, before you can get rid of your symptoms.\" Of later years, Rudolph von Walden seems to have been more or less in eclipse, but the son, Chiropractor Sherman, operating from Atlanta, Ga., has maintained the von Walden tradition. Quackery of the von Walden type is hard to reach under any but state law, and state prosecuting attorneys are seldom overenthusiastic about bringing charges in cases involving medical fakers who liberally patronize local newspapers. Von Walden and his ilk cannot be reached under the postal fraud order, because the mails are used only in making the-\"contact,\" the remainder of the transaction, together with the payment of money, being personal. The National Food and Drugs Act cannot be invoked, as von Walden apparently sells no drugs in interstate commerce. Equally culpable with persons of the von Walden type are those allegedly respected newspapers which, by selling their space to quacks and sharing the. blood money that the quacks get, make it possible for charlatans to become rich.\u00ad ( Condensed from Hygeia,\u00b7 Feb., 1932.) Clayton E. Wheeler.-This man for some years carried on from his California headquarters a piece of mail-order quackery of the \"gland-rejuvenation\" type. In October 1928 the California State Board of Medical Examiners revoked Wheeler's license to practice, but one Judge Griffin a month later vacated and set aside the Board's order. In May 1934 the Post Office Department, after an extensive hearing, declared Wheeler's mail-order scheme a fraud and debarred it from the United States mails. Wheeler used to carry full-page advertisements in the Sunday maga\u00ad zine section of the Los Angeles Times. He also advertised in the San Francisco Examiner, Chrotiicle, Bt1lletin, Call and Post and other California papers. In fact, certain papers of California must have received, in the aggregate, tens of. thousands of dollars from Wheeler to enable him to exploit his frauds. In addition to his mail-order quackery, Wheeler apparently conducted so-called clinics which, according to the advertisements, consisted of the \"injection in the walls of the abdomen of the gland needed.\" As the injection treatment was obviously unsuited to the mail-order scheme, Wheeler sent to his dupes through the United States mails suppositories which were purported to contain certain glandular substances. The suppositories, which were to be used per rectum, according to Wheeler's own claim at the federal hearing, contained the following desiccated material: Thyroid 1\u00be grains S grains S grains 2 grains 1 grain The quantities given were said to represent the amount in each suppository and totaled, it will be noted, over 14 grains. The government analyst, however, who testified at the hearing declared that actually there was only 1\u00bd grains of protein matter in the suppositories that Wheeler sent out, and in at least one of the samples examined, the animal tissue was found to be largely composed of striated muscle fibers and not glandular tissue at all I MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 169 In addition to twenty-six suppositories that constituted the 11treatment,'' Wheeler also sent his victims four tubes containing semi-liquid matter. Each tube had a small rectal tip and the instructions were to use one tube a week, injecting the material into the rectum. According to the government analyst, the tubes con\u00ad tained some protein matter, with a small amount of carbolic acid as a preservative. The suppositories, it should be added, contained, in addition to their animal tissue, some strychnine and brucin. In Wheeler's booklets he published a picture of San Quentin prison and under it carried the statement: 11Where Dr. Wheeler conducted research and gland experimental work with excellent results.\" The facts were that Wheeler never had any official connection with San Quentin prison and never conducted any research or experimental work in that institution. In fact, Wheeler admitted at the hearing that he had never performed any such operations at San Quentin. Elsewhere in the same booklets Wheeler devoted a whole page to pictures of laboratory equipment which was described in the legend under the pictures as 11Dr. Wheeler's Experimental Laboratory for Goat Serums.\" The facts of the matter were, according to information furnished by Dr. Pinkham of the California State Board of Medical Examiners, that the pictures were actually those of a cocoa\u00ad butter suppository manufacturing plant which had no more to do with \"goat serums\" than it had to do with making diphtheria anti-toxin. Still elsewhere in the same booklets were pictures of Catalina Island and of some of the wild goats that are found there. Wheeler gave the impression that from 40,000 to 50,000 wild goats on Catalina Island had been made available to him for his gland work. On another page of the same booklet were pictures of Guadeloupe Island, showing huge numbers of \"goats awaiting transportation.\" According to Wheeler, he had entered into a contract with 11the owners of prac\u00ad tically all the herds of wild goats on Guadeloupe Island\" for his exclusive use. On still another page Wheeler reproduced a photograph of his private yacht-yes, quackery pays I-in which he claimed to make 11frequent trips to Guadeloupe Island.\" The facts were that Wheeler did not obtain any of his material from the wild goats on Catalina Island or from the Island of Guadeloupe. It is worth noting in this connection that Wheeler claimed-via the testimonials -to cure angina pectoris. The government report showed that Wheeler did not believe sufficiently in his own magic to use it upon himself. Wheeler suffered from angina pectoris for several years, having three or four attacks yearly, but always relied on the treatment prescribed by physicians for the relief of his attacks 1-(Co,idmsed from The Journal A. M. A., Oct. 6, 1934.) [Wheeler died in August 1935.) George Starr White.-This man, who lived in Los Angeles, was born in 1866. He was a 11drugless healer\" for some years, and finally, when he was more than forty years old, obtained a diploma from the New York Homeopathic Medical College. White claimed more degrees than a thermometer. He claimed the degree of Ph.D. from the National Eclectic Institute, Inc.-whatever and wherever this may be; the degree of LL.D. from Oskaloosa College, granted in 1919 (and White was not the first of his tribe to whom Oskaloosa College had granted honorary ( ?) degrees); the degrees of \"N.D.,\" 11D.C.,\" and \"Ph.C.\" from the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic (all of these being granted in 1921); and finally, the degree of \"D.O.\" (likewise granted in 1921) from a notorious diploma mill. \u00b7 In addition to these numerous American \"degrees,'' he declared himself a 11Fellow\" of the incorporated \"Society of Science, Letters and Art\" of London. This, to the uninitiated, might carry with it an air of erudition. The Society of Science, Letters and Art of London was a serio-comic fraud conducted by a cockney named Sturman, who, as a side-line, acted as an agent for the sale of various bogus 170 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS degrees of American origin. Fellowship was granted to anybody that would send Sturman one guinea ($5). The \"degrees\" have been such sought after by American quacks and \"patent medicine'' fakers. After obtaining his diploma from the New York Homeopathic Medical College in 1908, White obtained licenses to practice in New York, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Michigan. As long ago as 1915 White had espoused the cult of \"spondylotherapy,\" founded by the leading quack of the century, Albert Abrams, and in that year White was giving in the west and middle west one-week \"courses\" in spondylo\u00ad therapy. White was strong on endorsements. The RadiumactiV Company of Greatly reduced reproduction of one of George Starr White's advertisements in a Los Angeles paper. California, that put out a line of fake radioactive preparations, published a tes\u00ad timonial credited to George Starr White, who was quoted as saying that he had used the \"RadiumactiV Clay\" and was going to boost it in his lectures. The Electro Thermal Company of Steubenville, Ohio, which put out the \"Electro\u00ad thermal Dilator\" under the claim that it would cure \"prostatic trouble,\" published a puff also credited to George Starr White and appended thereto a list of the alleged learned organizations in which White held membership. The exploiters of a so-called Traction Couch, put out from Duluth, Minn., and having the appearance of a modern adaptation of the old rack of the Inquisition, reproduced what was purported to be a letter from George Starr White, in which it was stated that his patients were delighted with the couch and his pupils were \"enthused\" over it. The makers of a \"deep therapy\" lamp published a testimonial for their device credited to White, in which was expressed the opinion that it was the \"most perfect therapeutic lamp outfit that has ever been gotten out.\" White started as a booster for the Abrams E. R. A. quackery, although, later, he seemed to decide that he could accomplish more-for White-by being a MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 171 competitor, rather than a follower, of Abrams. White was also a \"joiner.\" There seemed to be few \"twilight-zone\" medical or quasi-medical organizations to which White has not belonged. White listed thirty-nine organizations in which he claimed membership. During the height of the influenza epidemic of 1918-1919, White put on the market a \"patent medicine\" that he called \"Valens Essential Oil Tablets,\" which were for \"Gripping the Flu out of Influenza\" and were also said greatly to benefit or cure incipient tuberculosis, hay fever, asthma and catarrh. About the same time White also put out \"Valens Oxygen Vapor\"-whatever that might have been-and he announced that he was willing to sell his \"private stock\" of this preparation for $30 a gallon. His Oxygen Vapor\u00b7 Oil, apparently, grew out of a little earlier piece of quackery-\"Oxygen Vapor,\" which seemed to have some relation to \"Oxyolene,\" put out by the Neel-Armstrong Company of Akron, Ohio. In 1915 and 1916 the Neel-Armstrong people were exploiting what they were then calling \"Oxygen Vapor\" and advertising it by bookets that were credited to George Starr White. \u00b7 But it was in the field of physical therapy quackery that White really dis\u00ad tinguished himself. Consider, for instance, his \"Filteray Pad.\" This was an electrical heating pad on which White, thanks to the lack of discrimination on the part of the United States Patent Office, had obtained a patent. White claimed that his Filteray Pad differed from an ordinary electrical heating pad, in that the heat that came from his pad had to pass through his \"Perfected Chemo-Chromatic\u00adUltra-Red-Ray Filter.\" The Filteray Pad, it seemed, was good for falling hair, Bright's disease, colitis, diabetes, epilepsy, \"lumps in the breast,\" malaria, nervous\u00ad ness, paralysis, \"skin diseases of all kinds,\" sleeping sickness, tuberculosis and \"all tumors, malignant or benign.\" In fact, there was given an alphabetic list\u00ad ranging from acne to x-ray burns-of about 150 pathologic conditions that were alleged to have been benefited by the Filteray Pad. Then, White had his \"Valens Bio-Dynamo Prostatic Normalizer,\" which was \"for prostatic and rectal troubles.\" This device was a large sized rectal dilator made of metal and, apparently, containing within it a magnet. Intriguing pictures of the Valens Bio-Dynamo Prostatic Normalizer showed radiating from it lines of magnetic force, and one especially interesting illustration presented the device in situ, with what appeared to be an elaborate display of fireworks coming from the \"Normalizer\" and completely enveloping the pelvic region of the male subject in which it was applied I The principle of the \"Pros ta tic Normalizer\" was much too good to limit to a single sex, hence George Starr White also had a \"Valens Bio-Dynamo Pelvic Normalizer,\" for application to women. This device was a \"Sexual Normalizer\" and a \"natural rejuvenator.\" Illustrations showed the \"Sexual Normalizer\" in position, with the same sort of fireworks display as was shown in the case of the \"Prostatic Normalizer.\" White's price was $35 $45 for the \"Pelvic Normalizer.\" About the time that Abrams was getting a large amount of publicity and perquisites in the exploitation of his so-catted electronic reactions-\"E. R. A.\"\u00ad White was featuring his \"Bio-Dynamo-Chromatic which he abbre\u00ad viated \"B-D-C.\" The difference between Abrams' diagnostic methods and White's was not great. White's method seems to have been to have the patient face east or west and have his bare abdomen percussed until a dull area was located. The patient was then faced north or south and again percussed. Then different colored lights were thrown on the patient, the location of the areas of dullness being determined meanwhile. It was claimed that a combination of ruby and blue lights would \"cause a reflex in cases of gonorrhea,\" a \"green light will cause a reflex in cases of liver or gallbladder trouble,\" while the color for carcinoma was orange-red. White claimed at the time that his B-D-C would 172 MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS \"diagnose cancer before any known method\" and that many cases that had been diagnosed as nonsyphilitic, he \"diagnosed by this method as being syphilitic, and time has proved they were.\" White's Bio-Dynamo-Chromatic Diagnosis scheme seemed to undergo an evolution, to give place to \"Rithmo-Chrome Therapy,\" which the public was told, was \"treatment by means of rhythm, complementary colors and the magnetic forces of the earth-all in harmony or tune with the patient.\" Of course, Dr. White had some apparatus to sell. There was the \"Rithmo-Lite Generator,\" which was said to be a powerful machine devised by him \"for fading in and fading out light from one or more fifteen-hundred-watt lamps at one time\" ; then, there was the machine known as the \"Rithmo-Chrome,\" which he devised for \"fading in and fading out colors in rhythmic recurrence to harmonize with any individual.\" Apparently White was not particular about what special brand of treatment was used, just so it was a White treatment He even suggested that it was advantageous . to the patient to inhale his \"Oxygen Vapor\" at the same time that the patient was taking his Rithmo-Chrome Dynamo-Chromatic Treatment, and, while doing so, have the same patient sit on one of his Filteray cushions I Presumably, it was only because the patient was sitting that he did not also suggest that his \"Prostatic Normalizer\" be used at the same time I In passing, it is worth while calling attention to the lack of originality shown by White. The \"Bio-Dynamo-Chromatic Diagnosis\" was a modification of Abrams' \"E. R. A.,\" of which White was disciple; his \"Valens Bio\u00ad Dynamo Prostatic Normalizer\" was a modification of the rectal dilator put out by the Electrothermal concern, for which White gave a testimonial; his \"Rithmo\u00ad Chrome Therapy\" seemed to be a modified form of another fake known as \"Spectro-Chrome Therapy\" and exploited by Dinshah P. Ghadiali; his \"Valens Oxygen Vapor\" seemed to have a definite relation to the old \"Oxyolene\" of the Neel-Armstrong concern, while his \"Filteray Pad\" differed, it seems, only in the size of the device from the \"Vit-O-Net\" quackery. Printers' ink is the life-blood of quackery. But it costs money and the quack who knows the business does not draw wholly on his own bank account for the publicity necessary to keep him before his public. There flourish in our country various organizations definitely anti-medical and distinctly inimical to public health. These are supported mainly by well-meaning, but credulous, persons whose ignorance, prejudices and wrong-headedness are played on by shrewd individuals who make an easy living conducting these organizations. There are anti-vivisection societies, anti-vaccination societies, leagues for medical freedom, medical liberty leagues, and other organizations that \u00b7 bring in a handsome income to those that conduct them. As part of the propaganda that such organizations put forth, quotations from persons who are supposed to have special knowledge in the field of medicine are as necessary as are testimonials to the \"patent medicine\" industry. Naturally, such organizations are unable to obtain statements that suit their purposes from reputable physicians. But that part of the public that is deluded by concerns of this type is wholly unable to distinguish between a William Osler and a George Starr White. Naturally, then, when persons of the White type wish to get some free publicity, they make statements that will support the peculiar fallacies pro\u00ad mulgated by organized faddists, and they are, then, quoted and their names played up, thus gaining much publicity at no cost. One of the most active of the anti-medical groups was the \"American Medical Liberty League\" ( which see) . As incidental to the attempt on. the part of the American Medical Liberty League to discredit scientific medicine, it opposed the tuberculin test for milk-cows and, undoubtedly, obtained substantial support from those whose selfish interests would abolish the tuberculin test. Part of the MISCELLANEOUS PRACTITIONERS 173 propaganda against tuberculin testing of cattle issued by the American Medical Liberty League was an article by \"George Starr White, M.D., F.R.S.A., London.\" In several instances in which an organized fight was made in state legislatures against the tuberculin testing of cattle, the statements of George Starr White were solemnly quoted as though they came from a reputable scientific source and meant something. From what has been said, it should not be difficult for any one with intelligence to recognize the fact that George Starr White commercialized the practice of medicine, and had no scientific standing, and that his opinions on matters dealing with modem medicine were wholly without value.-( Condensed from The l ounial . A. M. A., April 13, 1929.) OBESITY CURES AND TREATMENTS Everywhere today one finds advertisements of cures and treatments that are warranted to turn stylish stouts into sylphs. If these anti-fat preparations, drugs or combination treatments were simple humbugs that did not affect the public health, physicians might ignore them. Unfortunately, most of the alleged short cuts from obesity to lissomeness are actually or potentially harmful to health, and some of them are even threats to life itself. While it may sound brutal, it is nevertheless a fact that nearly every person who is overweight reaches that condition because of overeating and underexercising. There are, it is true, a small proportion of overfat persons who owe their unfor\u00ad tunate condition to certain glandular dysfunctions; but their number compared to the total number of obese men and women, is negligible. Certainly the great percentage of men and women who are overweight are so because of errors in diet and too little muscular exercise. It is to these that the exploiters of alleged reducing cures appeal. With few exceptions, obesity cures are advertised under the claim that they are short cuts to weight reduction and that those who use them do not need to modi\u00a3 y their eating habits nor do they need to take more exercise. To the person without medical training, the treatment of obesity may seem as simple and elemental as the weighing of a sack of flour; the obesity-cure advertiser aims to sustain this thesis. The great lure to the public of the . enthusiast and the faddist, as well as of the notorious quack, is the seeming simplicity and pleasing plausibility of their claims. Really the treatment of overweight may be, and fre\u00ad quently is, a most complex matter; not that the fundamentals of overeating and underexercising are in themselves complex, but that the application of individual treatment may well be so. How much less should the overfat eat and how should the dietary be arranged that the nutritional balance is not too greatly disturbed? How much more exercise should the overweight take and still not throw a dangerous strain on the heart or other vital organs? A high medical authority, in discussing the treatment of obesity, has said : \"There are few diseases that the physician is called on to treat in which it is so vitally important to adapt the treatment to special cases, as in obesity, and it must be varied from day to day to respond to indications as they arise.\" For the purposes of briefness and clarity, the unscientific cures and treatments for obesity might be classified as (1) mechanical devices (2) chemical substances and (3) food products. Of these three, by far the largest one of the groups is the second, which, in itself, must be divided into those products that are for external use and those that are for internal use. The mechanical devices advertised for the alleged reduction of weight may be harmless ; they are invariably worthless. They fall into three general groups : rubber garments, mechanical vibrators and massage rollers. The garments, girdles or belts are sold under the claim that when these are worn, the movement of the body will massage away the fat; such a claim is quite fantastic. Actually, th,e only result that is obtained from the use of these rubber garments is that of either supporting pendulous portions of the anatomy or, by pressure, redistributing the more obese portions of the body somewhat more artistically without any actual reduction in the total amount of adipose tissue. That these so-called elastic reduc-OBESITY CURES 175 ing belts may give a feeling of support to those whose muscular tone is poor is unquestionably true; that they have anything whatever to do with the reduction of weight is just as certainly untrue. The mechanical vibrators and massage rollers are quite incapable of producing the effects advertised. As has been pointed out by the Council on Physical Therapy of the American Medical Association, such devices are likely to do exactly what a scientific masseur tries to avoid doing ; they pinch the superficial tissues instead of picking up and kneading both the deep and the superficial tissues. The same Council has condemned the mechanical vibrators because they do not produce any active exercise. people \u00b7nted To Reduce by Quick, New JAD Method for 2/ a D.a.Y Now if you are fat Y91l can ~! ~ur fill and yet grow thin-b_y .the ne.w JAD Method of reducing. __ Indeed. you can lose as much as seven full pounds\u00b7 the first week and look pounds lighter from the very: first day!...

Jad salts was for many years advertised as a cure for kidney disease, Three times the product was declared misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act because of the false and fraudulent claims made for it. Today \"Condensed Jad Salta\" is an alleged obesity cure. As for the products comprising the second large group, chemical substances for external and internal use, their name is legion. Those sold for external use, while varying somewhat in physical characteristics, are, without exception, totally worth\u00ad less. Some of the preparations have been sold in the form of pastes to rub on the surface of the body, others as soaps to be used in the place of the ordinary toilet variety, still others as powders or crystals to be put in the bath y.,ater. All are 176 OBESITY CURES utterly valueless as a means of reducing adipose tissue. There is no substance known that, whether rubbed on the surface of the body or put into the bath water, will bring about a reduction of fat.

Moreover, such a method of reducing weight may not be free from danger. OBESITY CURES' 177 It is also true, of course, that repeated hot baths, by stimulating perspiration, will reduce temporarily the fluid weight of the body ; but the fluid balance is rapidly made good by the liquid intake in the form of water or other beverages. One can dismiss, then, from any serious consideration all the pastes, soaps or bath powders that are sold for external use in the alleged treatment of obesity. They are all humbugs. The chemical substances for internal use that are sold as alleged obesity cures comprise by far the greatest number of preparations in this field. They come in the form of pills, salts, liquids and even medicated chewing gums. In principle, however, they all work in one of two ways: They contain drugs that stimulate metabolism ( the body processes) or they contain cathartics. The metabolic\u00ad stimulant types of ''obesity cures\" are definitely dangerous to health and even to life. They have for their essential ingredient either thyroid substance or dinitro\u00ad phenol and its allied substances. The thyroid type of \"obesity cure\" may be responsible for occasional deaths and certainly are for many cases of thyroid intoxication that result in the patient's being hurried to the operating table. They are responsible, too, for innumerable cases of nervous disorders due to the over\u00ad stimulation of the thyroid gland by the taking of these preparations. Dinitrophenol is a comparative newcomer, not only to the field of the \"obesity cures\" but to medicine. Already several deaths have been reported from the use of this powerful substance. Dinitrophenol and some of its allied compounds not only stimulate metabolism but have the property of producing an artificial fever. The taking of dinitrophenol has also resulted in the development of cataract. Newspapers, in reporting deaths from the use of this product as an obesity cure, have not inaptly described the action as a \"literal cooking to death\" of the victim. While subsequent experience may show that there is a place for dinitrophenol or its allied compounds when in the hands of physicians who are familiar with its terrific potency, it is quite obvious that it has no place whatever in nostrums sold for the self-treatment of overweight. The other group of chemical substances used internally for the alleged reduction of weight comprises the purgatives or laxatives. There has been\u00b7 a veritable flood of variously named \"salts\" sold as cures for obesity, but there have also been \"teas,\" pills and other purgative preparations for the same purpose. All such drugs so stimulate the intestinal tract that the food is hurried through before much of it can be properly assimilated. In the case of the salts, or salines, as physicians call them, some weight is also temporarily reqioved by the action of such sub\u00ad stances in drawing water from the tissues into the bowels. It is to be remembered that most purgatives act by irritating the lining of the intesti~es so that, in addition to wasting good food, obese persons who persistently take purgativ:es for the purpose of reducing their weight are also in grave danger of seriously iQ.juring their \u00b7 digestive functions. The third and last general group of \"obesity cures\" has been classed, for want of a better description, as \"food products.\" These comprise the so-called reducing breads and a more recent addition to the obesity-cure field of what might be termed food-powders. The reducing breads had considerable vogue a few years ago. They contained slightly more protein and slightly less carbohydrate than ordinary white bread. Compared with ordinary baker's bread, they were unpalatable. Food\u00ad powders, like the reducing breads, had no inherent anti fat properties. Just as any reduction that followed the use of reducing breads was due to the fact that the user was simply eating less bread than she did under normal conditions, so the so-called food-powders were also \"jokers.\" The food-powders consisted of products 178 OBESITY CURES like starch, soy bean flour or' some similar substance, a small helping of which was to be taken in place of one's normal breakfast and another small helping taken as a substitute for the normal luncheon. The breakfast consumed by the average sedentary woman usually has an energy value of about 500 calories, while her luncheon is about 700 calories. As the food-powders, when taken as directed, furnished only about 30 calories, it is obvious that persons following the food\u00ad powders method of reduction were simply going on a starvation diet, and an unbalanced diet at that. So much for the general discussion of preparations in the weight reduction field. In the list which follows is given in the most condensed form such infor\u00ad mation as has been reported regarding the composition of some of the obesity cures : REDUCING BREAns.-Among the most widely advertised products in this class have been: Ba.ry Bread.-Analysis showed this to differ but little in composition and energy value from graham bread. It was said to have been made of whole wheat flour, soy bean flour, carrots, fruits and yeast. Jack Sprat Bread.-This was found on analysis to have a caloric value of 1139 calories to the pound. Ordinary whole wheat bread bas a caloric value of 1140 to the pound. Wallact, Bread.-Tbis, when analyzed, was found to ba~e a total carbohydrate content almost equal to that of ordinary bread-1143 calories to the poun\"d as compared with about-1150 or 1200 calories in ordinary white bread. Foon-PoWDERs.-While there were many of these put on the market, only three of the most widely advertised are here dealt with : Sloll'.r Diet-Aid.-Thia cam~ in the form of a powder to be mixed with water and taken as a beverage. It was composed of milk chocolate, starch and a water extract of roasted whole wheat and bran. One or more cupfuls were to be taken as a substitute for breakfast and the same amount as a substitute for luncheon. Stardom's Hollywood Dict.-This also was a powder to be made into a drink. Analysis showed it to consist essentially of soy bean flour flavored with cocoa and salt. A teaspoonful was to be used in the place of breakfast and another teaspoonful in the place of luncheon. Minamin.-This powder also was to be taken in the place of the usual breakfast and luncheon. Analysis indicated that it was essentially powdered wheat germ. P ASTES.-0\u00a3 the external preparations in the form of pastes to be applied to the surface of the body, there have been: Absorbit.-Lard, oil, beeswax and a small amount of ox bile. Fato/f.-A paste containing 10 per cent soap and 90 per cent water. Morlme,-A gelatinized mixture of alcohol, soap, sodium iodide and sugar.

San-1-Sal.-Epsom salt with small amounts of baking soda and table salt. CHEWING GuMs.-0\u00a3 the preparations of a chemical type for internal use, there should be briefly mentioned first a few products in the form of chewing gum that have been put out as obesity cures. Of these there were : Bl/in Fat-Reducing Gum Drops.-Essentially sugar and the laxative drug phenolphthalein. Silph Chewing Gum.-A chewing gum of the chicle type containing sugar, thyroid substance, pokcroot and bladderwrack, or seaweed. Slends Reducing Gum.-A chewing gum for essential ingredient phenolphthalein. PILLS, Lrgums, SALTS, ETc.-The pills, salts and other preparations for internal administration as alleged obesity cures have appeared by the hundreds.

RHEUMATISM REMEDIES Rheumatism, as the term is generally used, is a much abused word, covering a multitude of pains and aches, whether in the bones, muscles or joints. As most of us are subject to passing attacks of more or less ill-defined pain or discomfort and as there is a general tendency to classify such indispositions under the loose term \"rheumatism,\" it is not surprising that the quack and nostrum vender reap a rich harvest in the sale of alleged cures for this almost universal, self-diagnosed complaint. Many charlatans who sell \"rheumatism cures\" recommended their products also for gout and neuralgia, and occasionally even for headaches, thus broadening the field for their nostrums. Many cases of rheumatism are due to an infection or infections in some part of the body. The patient may have been troubled for a long time by repeated attacks of tonsillitis or sore throat, or may have had an infection at the base of the teeth or in some other more remote part of the body. Then certain cases of so-called rheumatic pain may be due to misplacements or old injuries. Other cases in which the pain is in the knees or legs may be due to foot trouble. In acute attacks of rheumatic fever, the heart may be seriously affected and careful nursing with prolonged rest mai be more important than the administration of drugs. One of the commonest drugs to be used in the treatment of symptoms of rheumatism is some form of the salicylates. While this often gives relief to the symptoms, it may have an unfavorable action on the kidneys. For that reason the salicylates are drugs to be used only un~er proper supervision. More recently, another drug has come into wide-spread use in the treatment of rheumatism-cinchophen. This chemical does in many instances give some relief to the pain that is inseparable from this disease and when it was first introduced into medicine it was thought that the substance might be almost a specific for rheumatism. As its use increased, however, physicians found that :while in many instances it would give some relief to some of the symptoms of rheumatism in many other cases it had a very serious effect upon the liver. There has accumulated in medical literature a number of reports of serious untoward effects and, in a few cases, of death due to acute atrophy of the liver following the administration of cinchophen. Case's Rheumatic Specific.-This piece of quackery was sold on the mail\u00ad order plan. The \"treatment\" consisted of Rheumatic Pills and Liver Tablets. The pills contained colchicum and sodium salicylate; the tablets were made of cascara, aloin, podophyllin and baking soda. It was exploited in the manner common to mail-order quacks and in due time the federal authorities declared the business a swindle and debarred it from the use of the United States mails. Within a month after the issuance of the fraud order, the government, on the basis of an affidavit from the exploiter declaring that he would discontinue the business and would not revive it any time in the future, revoked the fraud order.\u00ad (Condetised from The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 13 and 20, 1919.) Case's Rheumatic Treatment.-This was exploited by the son of the exploiter of Case's Rheumatic Specific. He, like his father, sold his nostrum through the United States mails and in doing so capitalized and disgraced the uniform of the United States Army. He claimed that his \"rheumatism treatment\" was a pre\u00adscription that he got when overseas from a Dr. Beaupre whom he described as a \"noted French physician.\" There never has been a noted French physician of 182 RHEUMATISM REMEDIES this name and, while the exploiter claimed that Beaupre was at Aix-les-Bains, investigation failed to show that any physician of that name ever practiced there. The so-called prescription consisted (like the \"treatment\" sold by his father) of Rheumatism Pills and Liver Tablets. Also, the pills and tablets had the same general ingredients as those previously sold by the father. A pretense was made of sending to anyone who wrote for it a copy of the \"prescription,\" so that it could be filled in the local drug store. The trick is an old one among quacks. The prescription, when it came, called for one ingredient that drug stores do not ca.rry.-(Co,idensed from The Journal A. M. A., Watob salt. Cass Laboratories.-Of course there were no laboratories; the name was merely an imposing one for a crude piece of medical mail-order quackery. The advertising stated that the president of the laboratory was Harvey L. Cass. There was no such person although what purported to be pictures of H. L. Cass were part of the advertising buncombe, as was also what purported to be a photograph of \"Tom, Bob and Dick Cass\"; even a \"Mrs. Cass\" was dragged into this crude quack-hunt for victims. The Cass \"treatment'' consisted of pink tablets, gray tablets and a white powder. The pink tablets, when analyzed by the Chemical -\u00b7----\u00b7----- RHEUMATISM REMEDIES 183 Laboratory of the A. M. A., were found to be baking soda ; the gray tablets contained aspirin, cinchophen and charcoal; the white powder was epsom salt with a little flavoring. In October 1926 the Post Office Department was about to issue a fraud order against the Cass Laboratories when the man who ran the fakery submitted an affidavit stating that the business had been discontinued and would not be resumed. As a matter of fact, a month before this sworn statement was issued, the name \"Cass Laboratories\" had been abandoned and a new name, \"H. L. Cass Corporation,\" had been adopted.-( Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Jan. 15 and June 18, 1927.) Clearwater's Rheumatic Treatment.-This was put out by a man who quacked it with a somewhat extensive line of nostrums, some sold on the mail\u00ad order plan, others sold through drug stores. The \"rheumatic treatment\" was FELL DEAD Too \u00b7 ! DIOrrOWi. DROPS DEAD WHILE Wife reduced) of a small portion of the \"scare stuff\" used by Clearwater in connection with his 'heart cure\" quackery. sold through the mails and consisted of red tablets and white tablets. The red tablets were found to contain, on analysis, a very small amount of sodium iodide, about 5 grains of washing soda and a laxative. The white tablets also contained a laxative and some bitters (gentian).-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Dec. 18, 1926.) Chi-Ho-Wa.-This nostrum was put out by a former railroad engineer who did business from a postoffice box. In the follow-up letters, it was claimed that\" Chi-Ho-Wa was based on an Indian recipe which had cured the exploiter of rheumatism in four days. When Chi-Ho-Wa was analyzed by the federal chemists, it was found to be mainly alcohol and sugar with a very small amount of colchicine. As colchicine does not grow in America, it was obvious that the claim that 184 RHEUMATISM REMEDIES Chi-Ho-Wa was an Indian remedy was false. It was also brought out at the Post Office hearing that colchicine is an irritant to the kidneys and the gastro\u00ad intestinal tract and that prolonged administration of the drug may prove extremely harmful. On February 24, 1931, the Postmaster General closed the mails to the Chi-Ho-Wa fraud.-(Condensed from The Jourual A. M. A., May 30, 1931.) Harrell Associated Chemists.-This imposingly named outfit sold a \"cure\" for rheumatism on the mail-order plan. The incorporator and chief owner of this piece of quackery was described in the advertising as a \"professor,\" as a \"noted Virginia chemist\" and as an ''authority on physiological chemistry.\" The facts were that he was unknown to reputable medicine, pharmacy or chemistry. The \"treatment\" consisted of (1) gelatin globules holding a small amount of an oily Reproductions (greatly reduced) of parts of full page advertisements of the Harrell rheu\u00ad matism cure (left) and the Lewis Laboratory rejuvenation fraud (right). substance, (2) tablets and (3)' capsules. When tested in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., the oil in the globules was evidently oil of Wintergreen (methyl salicylate), the tablets responded to tests of cinchophen, and the capsules were filled with pink baking soda! Dr. Alexander Lambert of New York reported the case of a patient who had dosed himself with this rheumatism cure and who, when the doctor first saw him in the medical wards in Bellevue Hospital, was distinctly jaundiced. The condition became progressively worse and in a short time the man died of acute yellow atrophy of the liver.-(Condensed from The Jour11al A. M. A. of various dates.) Mizar.-This preparation, sold first from Chicago and later from a Chicago suburb, was described as the \"most effective remedy for rheumatism.\" Mizar was an ointment that smelled of bergamot and lemon. The instructions were to rub it on the parts affected, then bandage the parts and keep them warm. The RHEUMATISM REMEDIES 185 advertising stated that, on the second or third day, an eruption would appear with itching; this proved that the rheumatism was \"coming out l\" There were reported to the medical profession cases of severe eruptions following the use of this preparation. This was not surprising when it was learned by analysis in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. that the chief active ingredient in this ointment was red pepper.-(Condensed from The Jounial A. M. A., July 18, 1925.) Nurito.-Many years ago the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory analyzed Nurito and reported it to consist of milk sugar, phenolphthalein (a laxative) and pyramidon. Apparently, the composition of N urito was changed for in 1927 the stuff was reported to contain aspirin, caffeine, phenolphthalein and colchicum. Prescription A-28S1.-This preparation was known earlier as \"Eimer and Amend's Rheumatic Remedy\" and, according to the manufacturer, contained 45 per cent of wine of colchicum and a little more than 9 per cent of potassium iodide. Colchicum is so powerful that it has no legitimate place in \"patent medicines.\" Renton's Rheumatic Tablets\" and the product was put out under the claim that : \"What insulin is doing for diabetes, Renton' s Rheumatic Tablets are doing for arthritis, neuritis and rheumatism.\" Renton's Rheumatic Tablets were analyzed in the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory and found to be essentially cinchophen. After the government had forced the Renton concern to remove the word 11rheumatic\" from their labels, the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory analyzed the newly named product, Renton's Hydrocin Tablets. These were also found to contain cinchophen and tetra-ethyl-ammonium hydroxide. The Renton products are reported to have been responsible for several deaths.-(Co11densed from The Journal A. M. A., of various dates.) Rheuma.-This preparation was analyzed by the state chemists of Connecticut who reported in 1924 that it contained salicylic acid, potassium iodide and probably turpentine and some digitalis preparations. St. Jacob's Oil.-According to a report issued by the Michigan Dairy and Food Department in 1914, St. Jacob's Oil consisted essentially of turpentine 81 per cent, ether 9 per cent and alcohol 10 per cent. Sloan's Liniment.-When this preparation was analyzed by the federal chemists in 1918, they reported that it was essentially a mixture of kerosene (coal oil), turpentine, oil of sassafras and red pepper. When it was analyzed by the state chemists of Louisiana, they reported that it was about one-half oil of turpentine, about one-third oil of camphor, with some oil of sassafras and red pepper. Van Ard Sanatorium.-This concern was operated by the same individuals who were connected with the so-called Cass Laboratories. About the time that the name Cass Laboratories had been abandoned because of the action of the Post Office Department in its threat to issue a fraud order, the name \"Van Ard Sanatorium\" was brought into being. As has been mentioned, the Cass treatment was essentially cinchophen. The Van Ard Sanatorium treatment was, for all practical purposes, identical. In the latter weeks of 1929, reports were received from California of three deaths in which the principal autopsy findings were acute, or subacute, yellow atrophy of the liver. The physician who reported the cases stated that two of the women had been taking the Van Ard treatment, while the third had taken the Cass treatment.-(Condensed from The Jottrnal A. M. A., April 19, 1930.) 186 RHEUMATISM REMEDIES Transkutan.-This preparation was not sold direct to the public but was supposed to be sold only on a physician's prescription. The preparation was a liquid which separated into two portions, an upper (oily) layer and a lower (watery) layer. When analyzed in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A., the oily portion was found to be essentially turpentine to which had probably been added small amounts of menthol and camphor. The watery portion contained ~ertain salts. In using Transkutan, the patient got into a hot bath and was kept MEDICAL DEPARTMENT 8uu.ETJN No. ~1/.~M.D. Tbore up to the chin for five minutes; then the entire contents of a $5 bottle of Transkutan were poured evenly over the surface of the bath water. Naturally the turpentine flowed over the surface of the water. The patient was then taken slowly from the bath so that a film of turpentine ~overed the body. He was then wrapped in a blanket without rubbing and placed in a warm bed and allowed to sweat for two hours. Obviously, the same result might be obtained through the use of a few cents' worth of oil of turpentine.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., lime 9, 1928.) RHEUMATISM REMEDIES 187 Tripp's Liquor Rheumatica.-This preparation was analyzed in the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. and was reported to be a pale yellow liquid which, when shaken, became red. The red color was due to finely powdered red saunders. The preparation was also found to contain alcohol, potassium iodide and a very small amount of cinchona alkaloids. Cinchona (Peruvian bark) is the crude drug from which the alkaloid quinine is obtained.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Oct. 31, 1925.) W eldona.-This preparation seems to have varied in composition, as do so many \"patent medicines.\" The product came in the form of white tablets and colored tablets. In 1924 the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. reported that the white tablets contained a laxative, probably cascara, while the colored tablets contained sodium salicylate and some vegetable extractives. No alkaloids were found. In 1925 the Health Bureau of Rochester, N. Y., tested Weldona and reported that some alkaloids were found, together with salicylates. In 1926 the Chemical Laboratory of the A. M. A. made another analysis of Weldona and found, in addition to salicylic acid; aspirin. In 1927 Weldona advertisements were 188 RHEUMATISM REMEDIES offered to some newspapers and the advertising agency declared that Weldona contained neocinchophen, cimicifuga, poke root and some other substances. A commercial laboratory that analyzed Weldona in 1927 reported finding poke root and cascara together with aspirin and salicylic acid. Weldona also seems to have contained, during some of its changes in formula, the drug cinchophen. Dr. Richard Cabot of Boston reported that some years ago he \"had an extraor\u00ad dinary series of cases of acute yellow atrophy in patients\" who all gave the history of having taken Weldona. In December 1932 ( N. J. 19487) 1 the federal authorities declared Weldona misbranded under the National Food and Drugs Act because of fraudulent therapeutic claims. The government chemists stated that at the time their analysis was made they found aspirin, chalk, extracts of plant drugs, including licorice, magnesium carbonate, sugar at_1d starch.-(Con\u00ad densecl from The Journal A.

Sometimes these styles are based on nothing more than a trend, as in the case of the obesity cure fakes that became popular when women sought the svelt figure. Frequently epidemics are commercialized by nostrum venders as has been done at various times when influenza has swept the country. In still other cases physical trends are responsible, as seems to have been the case in the flood of alleged cures for stomach ulcers, hyperacidity and general gastric distress which reached its peak during the depression. Doubt\u00ad less the economic stress through which the country passed with its resultant worry and mental depression did bring about an increased incidence of so-called gastric neuroses. Certainly gastric distress was widely prevalent during that period. Persons thus afflicted had their condition sti11 further aggravated by the psychic results of the \"patent medicine\" advertisements, either in the newspapers or over the radio, which attempted to develop the fear complex-to make well people think they were sick. The belief was implanted in the minds of the sufferers that they had stomach or intestinal ulcer and they were led to believe that the only hope of escaping the operating table was to buy some \"patent medi\u00ad cine\" advertised for \"stomach ailments.\" In this brief chapter, a few of the more widely advertised nostrums of this type are dealt with. Currier's Tablets.-These were advertised in newspapers and over the radio. Those who wrote asking for information regarding the product received a letter printed in imitation typewriting stating that the tablets were \"not merely a tem\u00adporary relief, but are intended to stimulate the stomach to normal and overcome the cause.\" The tablets were sold for $5 a bottle and the purchaser was told that if after fifteen days' use he was not satisfied that he was being benefited he might return the balance of the tablets and the $5 would be refunded. Part of the advertising that was mailed to those who wrote to the concern was a story devoted to the alleged discovery of Currier's tablets. It was to the effect that in 1911 a \"tall, dejected, depressed, unhappy\" man, who weighed \"a mere 137 pounds,\" was suffering from an \"enlarged liver.\" While he finally reduced his liver to a normal size, he was still, alas, but a \"shell of a man.\" According to the story, he took \"pounds and pounds of baking soda . . . . . gallons of peppermint.\" He then decided to do a little experimenting and with the aid of a \"chemist friend\" and \"months of laboratory work\" developed the marvelous secret, Currier's Tablets. Another piece of advertising was a sixteen\u00adpage pamphlet, two pages of which were devoted to giving the public some interest\u00ad ing misinformation regarding the human stomach. A picture of what was described as a \"normal empty stomach\" showed it as an open bag. Had the Currier advertising men looked up even their high school physiology textbooks, they might have learned better. Two more pages of the pamphlet were devoted to proving that Currier's Tablets would cure stomach ulcers. There were, of course, many pages of testimonials in the pamphlet. One, allegedly from a woman in Texas, stated that Currier's Tablets had wonderfully helped her husband who had suffered from what \"some said was cancer.\" The pernicious implication in advertising of this kind is obvious. The A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory was asked to analyze this secret remedy that had been developed \"after months of laboratory work\" with the aid of a \"chemist friend.\" On the basis of their analysis, the chemists reported that Currier's Tablets had approximately the STOMACH REMEDIES 191 following composition : Baking soda, magnesium oxide and bismuth subnitrate. Nearly every large pharmaceutical house stocks tablets having essentially the same composition and sells them at less than $2 a hundred-Currier's Tablets sold for $5 a hundred. That Currier's Tablets might give temporary relief in cases of hyperacidity could be admitted; but so might a little baking soda. It was equally true that a person with stomach or duodenal . ulcer or beginning cancer who attempted to treat himself with Currier's Tablets-or any other \"patent medicine\"-would be running serious risks.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Juliy 15, 1933.) Kolloyd.-This was put on the market by what was first known as Kolloidal Research Laboratories, Inc., and later changed to Kolloyd Laboratories, Inc. It appeared that the company had for its president a man who had been previously connected with an advertising agency. As has been repeatedly pointed out, the most important asset for the commercial exploitation of a \"patent medicine\" is the knowledge of advertising. It is quite unnecessary to know anything about medicine, pharmacy or chemistry. In 1933 the postal authorities looked into the Kolloyd exploitation and on June 28 of that year the Postmaster General, after a thorough investigation had been made, issued a fraud order clo~ing the mails to Kolloidal Research Laboratories, Inc., the Kolloyd Laboratories, Inc., and J. L. Barnard, manager. The postal authorities reported that the Kolloyd concern was organized by Barnard and his wife who got two other persons whose names were not mentioned to furnish the capital. Barnard admitted that he held no degree as a chemist and that his knowledge of therapeutics was limited to such informa\u00adtion as he claimed to have acquired by having consulted doctors regarding his own case and the reading of medical works on the treatment of gastro-intestinal ulcers. Barnard had had about 25 years' experience in writing advertising, includ\u00ad ing especially the preparation of \"patent medicine\" advertisements. Barnard admitted at the Post Office hearing writing the copy for Kolloyd. Barnard also claimed to have suffered from ulcers of the stomach for 28 years and to have been 192 STOMACH REMEDIES unsuccessfully treated by several physicians, but he claimed to have been cured by the use of a product containing a colloidal hydroxide of aluminum. He admitted, however, that he still had recurrences of his trouble. Kolloyd was sold in two forms-a tablet and a capsule. It consisted of about equal amounts of aluminum hydroxide and milk sugar. In the Kolloyd advertising, Barnard purported to tell his own experiences in which he stated that he had been treated by some of the best physicians in the United States without success and that then he went to Europe hoping that he could find something there and, according to Barnard he did. To quote: \"In Vienna I met Prof. Temple-72 years old-a famous portrait painter. I noticed he kept a little roll of tablets in his pocket, and every once in a while he took one. I was dieting -afraid to eat-or drink-or smoke. He laughed at me, listened to my story-and told me\u00ad he too bad ulcer and hyperacidity for over 20 years-he had had an operation-the trouble came back-and a physician finally told him about those little tablets . . .\" \"Believe it or not-I was comfortable in a few minutes after taking a couple of these tablets. Half an hour later the pain came back and I took a couple more, and became com\u00ad fortable again. This time I bad no pain by the time the next meal rolled around and by taking the tablets I didn't have any . . .'' \"To make a long story short, I brought these tablets to America. I call them B:OLLOYD tablets, They are Colloidal Hydroxide of Aluminum. I have given them to hundreds of my friends-and some of the recoveries sound like fairy-tales,\" Not only did \"some of the recoveries sound like fairy-tales,\" but the entire yarn was a fairy-tale. At the hearing Barnard is reported to have admitted that he did not go to Europe, that he never met Professor Temple, that he never obtained any tablets from him, and that he never brought any tablets to America I In the elaborate advertising and high-pressure salesmanship on Kolloyd, the changes were rung on the thesis that by the taking of Kolloyd a person could cure a stomach ulcer in three weeks. At the Washington hearing Barnard attempted to deny that the advertising was intended to convey such an idea. Even the medical expert employed by the Kolloyd concern to testify at the hearing admitted that the shortest length of time in which he had observed an ulcer to be thoroughly healed was over two months. The government brought out at the hearing that medical authorities are generally agreed that, in the healing of a stomach or duodenal ulcer, next to diet and rest, the time element is of prime importance, and that the usual period of healing is one of several months' duration. Even in such cases it is pre-supposed that the patient has been properly hospitalized or that his regimen of rest and diet is under scientific supervision. It was further brought out at the hearing that Barnard's concern emphasized in its advertising that \"you can eat practically everything as soon . as you start the Kolloyd treatment\" and that \"no dieting is necessary.\" Yet, those who sent money for Kolloyd received a pamphlet containing a list of foods they were told to avoid I It was shown, too, that while the advertising claimed that Kolloyd was not a \"patent medicine,\" the evidence shows that apparently the only reason it was not a \"patent medicine\" was that Barnard had been advised by his attorneys that as another similar preparation had already secured the patent, it would be indvisable for him to apply for a patent, as it was not likely that he would succeed in obtaining it. Evidence was also submitted to show that Kolloyd, which sold through the mails for $2 a box, was of the same composition as another preparation which could be bought in drug stores for 75 cents.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Nov. 4, 1933.) STOMACH REMEDIES 193 Pfunder's Stomach Tablets.-This was advertised as \"A Remedy for Ulcers of the Stomach.\" Mr. Pfunder stated that he did not represent his tablets as a \"cure-all' but \"in every case where indicated, they have proven to be highly efficient.\" Mr. Pfunder was written to by the Bureau of Investigation of the A. M. A. and told that the Bureau had received a number of inquiries regarding the product and he was asked whether he cared to give any information that would enable the Bureau to answer such inquiries intelligently. Mr. Pfunder replied that Pfunder's Stomach TaiJets Patented in United Statca Patent Olflce No. 2'Hl2\" he was willing to give any information relative to the tablets except \"to reveal the formula.\" In other words, he was willing to give any information except the very information that would make it possible to express an opinion on the merits of the product. The A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory was asked to analyze Pfunder's Stomach Tablets. It did so and reported that it found that each Pfunder Tablet contained approximately 9 grains of baking soda, 8 grains of magnesium oxide and 11 grains of bismuth subnitrate.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A.1 Dec. l, 1928.) 194 STOMACH REMEDIES Tums.-The company which put out \"Nature's Remedy\" (usually abbreviated N. R.) also put on the market Tums as a remedy for \"gassy fullness, burning sourness, belching, nausea, upset stomach, etc.\" The newspaper advertisements described Tums as \"the mint that relieves stomach distress.\" They were said to be made with the \"very finest mint obtainable ; contain extra ingredients that quickly drive away heartburn, acid indigestion, sour stomach and gas.\" Some of the Tums advertising was of what was known as the \"knocking\" type-the attempt being made to charge certain wholesome food products with being respon\u00ad sible for digestive disturbances. Such headings as, \"Does Sausage Give You Indigestion?\" with a picture of a sausage in the shape of a man, dealing a blow to the solar plexus of the sufferer, and \"Onions? I Like 'em But They Don't Like Me.\" The public was instructed to \"Eat Tums Like Candy\" and was .told that they might be eaten \"as often as necessary to keep the stomach sweet and settled.\" An analysis of Tums indicated that the product was .essentially chalk and sugar Do favorite foods sometimes d.isagreet causing that gassy ftillness, burning etc.?

If advertised truthfully and with the warning that \"stomach distr~ss\" may mean not merely a temporary hyperacidity but possibly stomach ulcer or even cancer, there might be a legitimate place in the home medicine cabinet for these pepper\u00ad mint-flavored tablets of chall< and sugar. But, if advertised truthfully, they would probably not sell.-(Co11den.sed from Tlte Jounzab A. M. A., May 23, 1931.) Udga.-The Udga Medicine Company of St. Paul, Minn., which put out Udga was formerly known as the Phungen Laboratories. Udga was advertised as a mail\u00ad order treatment for stomach ulcer, gastritis and dyspepsia. Because of the similar\u00ad ities in the names \"Phungen\" and \"Pfunder ,\" a still greater similarity in the appearance of Udga Tablets with Pfunder, the fact that they both came from the same part of the country (one from Minneapolis and the other from St. Paul) STOMACH REMEDIES 195 and the fundamental fact that both were advertised for stomach ulcers, the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory was \u00b7 asked to make some tests to determine whether or not the same ingredients that were in Pfunder Stomach Tablets were in the Udga product. The laboratory reported that tests indicated the presence of bismuth, magnesium, sodium, nitrates, carbon dioxide and starch. It seemed more than likely therefore that Udga was similar in composition to the Pfunder Tablets which were found to contain baking soda, magnesium oxide and bismuth subnitrates.\u00ad ( Condensed from The Jonrnal A. M. A., Feb. 15, 1930.) Willard's Tablets.-These were sold on the mail-order plan. Part of the advertising follow-up material sent out by the company was a saffron-colored sheet called \"Certificate of Deposit\" which certified that the Willard Tablets Company had placed on deposit 'with the First United Finance Corporation of Chicago \"suffi\u00ad cient sum of money to insure the prompt, full, cash refund\" of all requests ma.de by persons who, after fifteen days' use of Willard's Tablets, were not convinced that they had received any benefit. The same \"certificate\" also stated that the First United Finance Corporation had examined all the letters that were used in testimonials in the Willard's Tablets advertising. The public, of course, had no means of knowing that the First United Finance Corporation operated from the same address and used the same telephone number as the Willard Tablets Company. Willard's Tablets were advertised over the radio and those who wrote in to the concern after listening to the program received a form letter in imitation type\u00ad writing with the usual number of testimonials, the previously referred to \"Certifi\u00ad cate of Deposit\"\u00b7 and a twelve-page leaflet entitled to Stomach Sufferers.\" According to the \"message,\" Wiltard's Tablets were a \"quick, positive relief\" for such conditions as stomach and duodenal ulcers, sour stomach, gas pains, hyperacidity, indigestion, belching and various other digestive ailments. The average person not trained in medicine would be likely to get the impression from reading the Willard's Tablets advertising that the tablets themselves were some remarkable formula, unique in the history of therapeutics. The facts were, they were just one more of the antacid preparations containing essentially baking soda, magnesium oxide and bismuth subnitrate.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., Inly 15, 1933.)

TESTIMONIALS \"If your brains won't get you into the papers, sign a 'patent medicine' testimonial. Maybe your kidneys will.\"-Toronto Star. Testimony, to be commercially valuable, must have the appearance of truth and must be acceptable to those who, from lack of special knowledge, are unable to recognize any fallacy that may be present. The bulk of testimony in the medical field that is commercially valuable is scientifically worthless. It is valuable com\u00ad mercially because the public thinks it represents experience ; it is worthless scien\u00ad tifically because, at its best, it details but a sequence of events and not a casual relationship. In other words, it comes from those whose testimony is incompetent. The testimonial has always been, and probably always will be, the sheet anchor of the quack. Time has left it unchanged in essence. An experience of nearly thirty years in the investigation of testimonials in the medical field has brought out the fact that, contrary to the rather universal belief that most medical testimonials are either faked or purchased, the majority of such testimonials are documentarily genuine and have been given quite sincerely. Most of them, it is true, are edited, in order to render less obvious the ignorance and illiteracy of those who wrote them, but, broadly speaking, they are genuine. Not always, of course. There have been testimonials published by the sellers of those package medicines of secret composition, colloquially, but incorrectly, called \"patent medicines,\" that are produced in the offices of the exploiter or of the agency that handles the advertising account. Consider, as a classic example of the former, the alleged testimonials used some years ago in advertising Mayr's Wonderful Remedy for Stomach Trouble. The remedy was originally sold under the promise that \"It Removes Gall Stones and Shows Them to You\" and this claim actually appeared on the label of the prepara\u00ad tion prior to the passage of the National Food and Drugs Act, which made lying on or in the trade package expensive instead of merely immoral The Mayr product consisted of a large dose of a bland oil to be followed by Rochelle salt. One of the advertising copy-sheets, with instructions to the printer, consisted of a large page containing more than forty alleged testimonials-unsigned-each describing how the writer had been saved from death or suffering by the taking of Mayr's Wonderful Remedy. Eaeh of these forty-odd testimonials had a heading in large, bold-faced type, and in each heading there was left a blank space that was to be filled in by the compositor before the newspaper ran it. The instruction sheet emphasized in black-face type : \"Insert name of your city in heading of each ad.\" Thus, one of these \"testimonials'' in the copy-sheet bore the heading: \"Old-\u00ad Resident Given Up By Physicians.\" The testimonial itself-in quotation marks\u00ad states that the \"old resident\" had been given up by five doctors and was finally saved by Mayr's remedy. When the advertisement appeared in a Marion, Ohio, paper the heading read: \"Old Marion Resident Given Up By Physicians\"; when it appeared in an Austin, Minn., daily it was: \"Old Austin Resident Given Up By Physicians\" ; in a Chicago paper it became: \"Old Chicago Resident Given Up By Physicians.\" And so with the forty-odd other alleged testimonials. With this system of testimonial advertising the publisher could be under no misapprehension regarding its obvious fraudulence. The newspaper, in accepting the copy, frankly participated with the \"patent medicine\" maker in his campaign of falsehood. Seldom has even a \"patent medicine\" vender shown a more cynical disregard for elementary business honesty. 198 TESTIMONIALS As an example of the testimonial created by the advertising agency, there was the case of the \"Hobart Bradstreet\" advertisement. Bradstreet sold a mail-order course in \"spine motion\"-every man his own chiropractor. In carrying the message of spine motion to the world, the advertising agency that handled the account pre- I \"I WOUlDN'T BE WITHOUT NEW KONJOlA\" \"Xonjola.

But the Federal Trade Commission, which occasionally takes the joy out of certain forms of commercial chicanery, brought in a report showing that \"Colonel Bemis,, was a jewelry sales\u00ad man who eked out his income by posing as a photographer's model, that the bride was a professional model, and that neither bride nor groom had ever heard of Hobart Bradstreet nor his mystery, \"spine motion.\" Deaths l'rlrs. l\\fary Deemer of Allentown, Pa., she \"Natex\" the only \"patent medicine\" that \"really gave relief.\" Mrs, died May 25, 19351 Her testimonial was pub\u00ad \u00b7Iisbed in the Allentown ~orning Call May 27, 1935. On the same page and but three columns removed from the testi\u00ad timonial was Mrs. Deemcr's death notice I While we enjoy today a renaissance of the testimonial industry, the business was at its best-or, shall we say, worst-commercially in the closing decade of the last and the opening decade of the present century. Then, it was part of the day's work for bucolic statesmen and other notables to testify to the virtues of Peruna, Paine's Celery Compound, Duffy's Malt Whiskey, et al. Those with long memories may recall the half-page newspaper advertisements that the Peruna people published about 1904, containing the famous testimonial of Admiral Schley. It is but fair to say that the admiral was not in such bad company-if the Peruna people's testimonials of that period are to be believed-for there were to be found among the endorsers of this alcoholic nostrum many names more or less notable. Old Doc Hartman, who manufactured the highly alcoholic Peruna, claimed that he had testimonials from fifty members of Congress, and he published many of them. He claimed, also, that twenty-five American generals had sent him letters 200 TESTIMONIALS of endorsement and he published the entire twenty-five, givmg the names and addresses of the individuals to whom they were credited. Hartman declared, too, and published the testimonials to prove it, that \"prominent admirals and captains of our Navy recommend Peruna.\" In addition, he gave special prominence to the testimonials (with names and pictures of the givers) of an ex-Lieutenant-Governor of Ohio, of a United States Senator from South Carolina, of a superintendent of THE _PATRIOT, HARRISBURG, PENNA.)

There was the usual proportion of testimonials for this disguised booze from gentlemen of the cloth: a Kansas City, Mo., pastor who was also State superintendent of the Missouri Christian Endeavor Society; a pastor of the First Spiritual Society of San Francisco; a rabbi of an Albany, N. Y., synagogue ; a pastor in Greensborough, Ga., and others.

Its manufacture was discontinued about the time national prohibition went on the statute books, for the reason, as the makers put it, that \"it was impossible to prepare this product without an excessive amount of alcohol.\" The Celery Com\u00ad pound makers also presented some highly respectable evidence-with names, dates and pictures-for the value of their product in the closing years of the last century. Not the least among their endorsers was Madame Bernhardt. The Divine Sarah was quoted as stating that she was convinced that Paine's Celery Compound was \"the most powerful nerve strengthener that can be found.\" This was backed up by testimonials from an LL.D. of Chicago, who, with his name and picture, was described as that city's \"most prominent clergyman\"; a mayor of Lowell, Mass., who took pleasure in recommending the Paine Product; a Congressman from Vir\u00adginia, who was so much pleased with it that he persuaded his brother to use it ; the wife of a United States Senator from Wyoming, who testified to the great benefit she received from its use, and a reverend doctor of divinity, editor of what was described as one of the most influential Methodist new~papers in the South, who expressed the opinion that it was the best nerve tonic that he had ever tried. There could be added to the Paine's Celery Compound testimonial list, also, a United States Senator from North Carolina, whose testimonial was reproduced in fac\u00ad simile; an endorsement from an Attorney-General of Kansas; a full-page pho\u00ad tographic reproduction of the endorsement, dated July 5, 1897, of the Governor of Vermont-the nostrum was a Vermont product-and, to cap the climax, one from the alleged father of the Blue Ribbon movement, who strongly endorsed this preparation which contained 20 per cent of alcohol and an insignificant amount of other drugs l Coming down to more recent times, some may remember the heavy advertising campaign for a \"patent medicine\" rejoicing in the name of Nuxated Iron. This preparation, which the chemists of the American Medical Association reported, contained practically no \"nux\" and but a negligible amount of iron, was advertised intensively by the testimonial route. First came endorsements of physicians, some of whom were described in the advertisements as noted, well-known specialists, but who on investigation proved to be superannuated advertising quacks. Then there were testimonials by retired generals and judges and the well-remembered ones of two former United States Senators. During the war, large advertisements announced \"Sarah Bernhardt Sends Nuxated Iron to the French Soldiers to Help Give Them Strength, Power and Endurance.\" But the nuxated endorsements that really touched the popular fancy were those from the sporting fraternity. These led off with a signed testimonial from Ty Cobb, whose come-back to the baseball world was ascribed to the renewed life with which N uxated Iron had filled him. Then came the pugilist series, opened by Jess Willard, who told how Nuxated Iron helped him to whip Frank Moran. When, in the course of events, Jess was knocked out by Jack Dempsey, the world learned, via the Nuxated Iron advertisements, that it was this nostrum that put Jack \"in such superb condition\" and helped him whip Jess. As Dempsey continued his successful career, each victory brought a testimonial from the champion ascribing his success to the marvels of N uxafed Iron: \"How N uxated Iron Helped Me To Whip Carpentier.\" \"How Nuxated Iron Helped Me To Whip Tom Gibbons,\" and, following the pyrrhic victory over Firpo, \"How N uxated Iron Helped Me Win Four Great Battles.\" When Mr. Tunney finally retired Mr. Dempsey, one looked in vain for a nuxated testimonial from Gene. The best that could be found was one from the new champion endorsing Nujol as a \"regulator\" and \"external rub\u00ad down.\" TESTIMONIALS Gall Bladder anti Stomach Trouble PETER J CLEMENS, J25 Drexel Ave , Detroit, Mich Mr. Clemens suffered a 11evcre at tack of stomach pains two years ago, belched large quantities of gas.

Yet even here investigation proves that most of the endorsements are documentarily genuine. But as in this realm it becomes possible also to produce documentary evidence of the worthlessness of the endorse\u00ad ments, the study is not without interest. Investigation of many hundreds of testimonials given for \"patent medicine\" has brought out these facts : Where the endorsements have been given for alleged cures for cancer or consumption, it is necessary only to wait some months and, if the victim actually was suffering from one or the other of these diseases, it is possible to obtain a death certificate that gives the lie to the testimonial. In the case of \"cures\" for epilepsy, hernia or deafness, one can, usually, by waiting a year or so, get from the writers of the testimonials admissions that they were mistaken in their claim to have been cured. But in that much larger field of nostrums of the cure-all type-those that are recommended for no specific condition-the attempt to obtain documentary evidence of the worthlessness of testimonials is always futile. The reason is obvious. When John Doe feels out of sorts it is ninety chances out of a hundred that, in a few days, he will be himself again-whether he \"doctors\" or not. In the interim, John ---- -. - ... ~~-A7.,..D dreus O 3&f'j, Tribune. -- I' I, - --- - -- This photo,raphic facsimile of a classified advertisement from a Chicago paper explains how some testunonials were obtained. takes some intensively advertised cure-all and recovers according to schedule. It is never possible to convince Mr. Doe that the medicine he took had no part in his recovery. The sequence of events becomes to him cause and effect. A few examples of the self-canceling testimonials : Miss Ida S. of Wisconsin fell into the hands of J. Lawrence Hill, a Michigan consumption-cure quack who published the girl's testimonial and added the claim: \"She is now cured.\" Inves\u00ad tigation brought a death certificate showing that the young woman had died of consumption more than a year prior to the time her testimonial was being cir\u00ad culated. Another testimonial for the same quack was that of Otto B., also of Wisconsin. The death certificate showed that poor Otto had died of tuberculosis two years earlier. Frank W. of Illinois gave a testimonial to the value of Hill's \"cure\" and died three months after giving it ; his endorsement was still going strong twenty-three months after he was buried. A California concern that sold Fulton's Compounds for diabetes and Bright's disease published many glowing testimonials. Take the case of Edward Z. of Iowa. Mr. Z. took thirty bottles of Fulton's Diabetic Compound and was willing to have the company ref er any one to him ; but. the death certificate records that Mr. Z. died of diabetes. The case of Mort G. of California was described by the Fulton concern as \"a pleasing incident.\" Mr. G. took about forty bottles of the remedy and died some months later; cause of death : \"uremic poisoning from diabetes.\" Daniel McH. of Virginia took the company's remedy for kidney disease and his testimonial was published, and the case recorded by the company as a \"nice recovery.\" Mr. McH.'s death certificate records \"interstitial nephritis\" as the cause of death. TESTIMONIALS 205 In the files of the Bureau of Investigation of the American Medical Association there are large numbers of testimonials for remedies for cancer, tuberculosis, diabetes, Bright's disease and other conditions ; filed with them are the death certificates of the individuals who gave these testimonials I Sometimes the god of chance gives the public a break in the testimonal game. Take, for example, the testimonial of Mr. M. of Nashua, Iowa, that appeared in the Nashua Reporter, gratefully endorsing Doan's Kidney Pills. The pulling power of this advertise\u00ad ment was seriously impaired by the fact that the death notice of Mr. M. appeared TIIA:'41101111' THREE IN ONE FAMILY MAKES II m H 1.1 q am , Patrick'., church.

The same issue of the Holyoke Daily Transcript contained the funeral notice of Mr. Wick, who had died of cancer of the stomach two days be\u00ad fore his testimonial appeared. in the same issue of the paper. Nostrum venders who use the local testimonial method of advertising need to keep check on their endorsers. Mrs. W. of Glenwood, Iowa, also testified to the virtues of Doan's Pills in an advertisement that appeared in the Glenwood Opinion. The Doan people said in introducing it: \"It is a story with a point which will come straight home to many of us.\" As the death notice of Mrs. W. appeared in the same issue of the paper as the testimonial, the company was probably right. Almost equally poor publicity for the Doan product was to be found in a locally published testimonial of Mr. F. of Kankakee, Ill., whose testimonial ran in June, although 206 TESTIMONIALS Mr. F. had expired during the previous March. Consider, too, the testimonial of Mrs. B. of Blackwell, Okla., which appeared in a local paper two months after the poor woman had passed on. How worthless \"patent medicine\" testimonials are from a scientific point of view is well exemplified in a statement made a few years ago by the Attorney\u00ad General for the Post Office Department. In the course of its duties, the Post Office Department has to investigate various medical concerns that use the United States mails to defraud. The Attorney-General in the memorandum to the The consumptive is peculiarly susceptible to the temptation of givin, testimonials. It bas long been known that any change in treatment, or in the individual givmir the treatment, bas a psychic effect on the consum~tive resulting in an apparent temporary improvement. It is during this period that the consumption cure\" quack gets his testimonial. Above are reproduced a few of the scores of testimonials we have on file given by consumptives who later succumbed to the disease. Some of the testimonials above were being used one and two years after the poor victims who gave them were dead! We have on file the death certificates of all of those whose testimonials are here reproduced-and of many others. Postmaster-General recommending the issuance of a fraud order in a given case had this to say regarding \"patent medicine\" testimonials, \"Speaking generally it may be said that in all my experience in this office never has a medical concern, no matter how fraudulent its methods or worthless its treatment, been unable to produce an almost unlimited number of these so-called testimonial letters.\" A most enlightening investigation of the \"patent medicine\" testimonial industry was made a few years ago by the National Better Business Bureau. That TESTIMONIALS 207 organization had occasion to look into the bona fides of a series of testimonials which appeared as part of the heavy advertising campaign for a nostrum known as \"Flaxolyn.\" The National Better Business Bureau had reason to believe from information it had obtained that some of the Flaxolyn testimonials were purchased at prices ranging from $10 to $850. Further, the Bureau learned that many of the so-called doctors who gave the testimonials for Flaxolyn were not licensed physicians at all. In order to determine the facts in the case, the National Better Business Bureau had investigators call on a large number of the persons who had given testimonials for Flaxolyn. These investigators represented themselves as agents for a nonexistent \"patent medicine/' The investigators asked the different Flaxolyn testimonial givers whether or not they would testify for this product for which they professed to be the agents. One of the Flaxolyn testimonial givers was quite willing to give a testimonial for the hypothetical \"patent medicine\" and suggested that he ought to get a good suit of clothes and a hat out of it. Another man admitted that he had received $840 for his Flaxolyn testimonial but would be willing to endorse their nonexistent medicine named by the Bureau's investigators for $300. Another person, a woman chiropractor, whose Flaxolyn testimonial had been published, stated to the Bureau's investigators that she had given the testimonial purely as an accommodation and, although the testimonial stated that she had used Flaxolyn herself, she told the investigators she had never tested it. One man admitted that he had expected to get $10 for his Flaxolyn testimonial, but had never received it. Another said that he had received $100 for his testimonial. Still another, a chiropractor, stated that he received $50 for his \u00b7 Flaxolyn testimonial, but he would want $75 for the new testimonial. \u00b7 A woman osteopath stated that she was to get $10 credit on a $21 set of books for her Flaxolyn testimonial but that she had seen neither the $10 nor the set of books. A Pittsburgh dentist agreed to endorse the hypothetical \"patent medicine\" for $400, but declined to do it for $250, stating that Flaxolyn had paid him con\u00ad siderably more. A Pittsburgh osteopath admitted that he got $50 for his Flaxolyn testimonial and would endorse the Bureau's alleged product for the same amount. These are but a few of the many facts that the National Better Business Bureau investigators unearthed in regard to this one set of testimonials, those issued for Flaxolyn. In the June 15, 1929, issue of The Journal A. M. A., there appeared a comment based on an editorial which had appeared a few weeks previously in the British Medical Journal. The British publication referred to some \"highly objectionable advertisements of a proprietary brand of yeast\" that, while appearing in American and Canadian periodicals also circulated in the ,British Isles. These advertisements, according to the British Medical J 011,rnal, were of the testimonial type and purported to be signed by European or American medical men. Following the editorial comment of the British Medical J oumal, a well-known London physician wrote to that publication and briefly recounted his\u00b7 experience. To quote : \"On April 3rd of last year my secretary made an appointment for me to see a Miss E. She duly appeared, not, however, in the guise of a patient, but in that of an advertising a\u00a3ent for a well known brand of yeast. Her proposition to me, made most charmingly, but in the best American business manner, was that I should write a testimonial extolling the virtues of yeast, this testinmonial, together with my name and photograph, to appear in magazines, newspapers, and (or) in other advertising media. published in the United States of America and Canada. For doing this I was to receive the sum of \u00a3150 ($750), To quiet any scruples I might have against so doing, I was informed that four members of my profession in London had already signed the agreement, a copy of which is here appended,\" The physician added that, when he showed the advertising agent to the door, he suggested that there were other things in life that he valued more than one hundred and fifty pounds I 208 TESTIMONIALS The most effective and entertainingly written article dealing with \"patent medi\u00ad cine\" testimonials was that published by Mr. Samuel Hopkins Adams some years ago in the New York Tribune. The article was entitled \"A Fake's Protest Is a Testimonial.\" Mr. Adams will be remembered by some as the author of one of the most scathing arraignments of quackery that was ever published, the \"Great American Fraud\" series that appeared in CollieY's some years ago. Mr. Adams' article on the Testimonial has been reprinted by the Bureau of Investigation of the A. M. A. in pamphlet form. The article closes with this statement : \"Few indeed are the testimonials that will stand the acid test of analysis. The test is easy to make. Put the testimonial on the witness stand; ask of it the Who, the What, and the Why as indicated in this article, and then form your own opinion of it. After that if you are duped it is because you are the natural food for fakers.\" Much of the material given above is modified from an article of the author's published some time ago in the American Mercury,\u00b7 the rest is from material by the author appearing in publications issued by the American Medical Association. TONICS, BITTERS, ETC. Karnak.-One of the peculiarities of the enforcement-or lack of enforcement -of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act was the fact that while the government spent much effort in attempts to curb the activities of rum-runners off our coasts it apparently ignored the vast home industry in alcoholics that was conducted under the guise of selling home remedies or \"patent medicines.\" Karnak was one of many alcoholic nostrums spawned during the prohibition era. It was put out by Drug Products, Inc., and admittedly contained 18 per cent alcohol by volume. Investigation indicated that the individuals who were back of the Karnak concern had previously been employed by the concern that put out Tanlac (another alcoholic \"patent medicine\") and pefore that by the company which sold what used to be known as Wine of Cardui. According to the statements made on or in the trade package, Karnak was \"composed of nine of the most beneficial roots, barks and herbs known to medical science.\" While it was alleged to be' free from \"habit-forming drugs,\" the chief therapeutically active drug in Karnak was alcohol. The introductory advertising campaign of Karnak featured the statement that the product was \"discovered by M. Pierre Andre, noted French chemist.\" There was no noted . French chemist by the name of Pierre Andre. Original bottles of Karnak were submitted to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory for examination. Each bottle contained approximately 7\u00be fluid ounces of a brownish-red liquid having an aromatic odor and a flavor that was at first sweetish and licorice-like but afterwards mildly bitter. Following the chemical analysis by which the chemists reached the conclusion that Karnak was not sufficiently medicated to prevent its use as a beverage, the stuff was subjected to pharmacological tests. These tests disclosed that the laxative action of Karnak was considerably less than one-tenth an equal volume of aromatic cascara. The pharmacologic expert declared that in his opinion an entire bottle of Karnak .did not contain the cathartic equivalent of 32 drops of the :fluid extract of cascara.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., Feb. 7, 1925.) Angostura Bitters.-In 1922 advertisements in newspapers and drug journals carried for Angostura Bitters in large, black-faced type the heading \"Vice-President of American Medical Association Testifies to This Tonic's Value.\" The advertise\u00ad ment went on to state that Dr. W. C. Wile, formerly vice-president of the American Medical Association, had testified under oath that he used Angostura Bitters in his practice as a stomachic, an anti-spasmodic, a tonic and also as a \"stomach curative in acute alcoholism after a debauch.\" There was nothing in the advertisement to permit the public to know the facts in the case. The facts were: (1) Dr. Wile was fourth vice-president of the American Medical Association fifty years ago, in 1886, and, incidentally, he was nominated for that position by a committee of which he himself was a member. (2) Dr. Wile was himself for many years in the nostrum business and was the practical owner of several nostrum concerns at Danbury, Conn. (3) Dr. Wile also owned a printing establishment which got out a low-grade, alleged medical journal devoted mainly to advertising the type of nostrums that Dr. Wile's concerns manufactured. ( 4) Dr. Wile, in addition to haying testified to the value of 210 TONICS, BITTERS, ETC. Angostura Bitters, had given testimonials for many other nostrums, some of them those put out by his own concerns. Neither did the advertisement give any hint that at the time it appeared Dr. Wile had been dead for some years or that his testimony had been given in a court case in which the exploiters of Siegert's Angostura Bitters charged that --r 1 \\ri~-President of : American 'Medical Association Testifies to Tonic's V aloe fo=.ce International t5ons in evc,17 part of the world have awlll'ded tt tho fftat prizes. In all history no otbertoDic haisever reoelved a\u00b7 like number of awards or baa been s:ranted such distinctions from the leading BOnrnments and crowned beads Angostura BitterS l for Health and Sir~\" ,~ This advertisement of Angostura Bitters (published in 1922) was a good example of \"patent medicine\" advertising ethics. The reading public would naturally believe that the testimonial was a recent one by a man who had recently held office in the American Medical Association. The facts were Dr. W. C. Wile had been dead over nine years, gave the testimonial (when acting as an \"expert\" witness) seventeen years previously, was fourth vice-president of the A. M. A. in 1888 and was, himself, an exploiter of nostrums. the public had been deceived into purchasing Angostura Bitters made by one C. W. Abbott. In this case, which was a suit in equity, the Siegert concern submitted certain alleged \"scientific opinions\" of the \"made in Germany\" type one of which was to the effect that Angostura Bitters was \"entirely free from all intoxicating ingredients\"-this in spite of the fact that Angostura Bitters contained over TONICS, BITTERS, ETC. 211 40 per cent of alcohol. The judge before whom the case was tried opined that it was extremely unlikely that these alleged German experts had ever existed. In commenting on the claim that there was nothing intoxicating about Angostura Bitters, the judge said: \"Shall the courts give by judicial decree a monopoly to certain persons who represent to the public certain bitters as containing nothing intoxicating when concededly they contain over SO per cent of water and over 40 per cent of alcohol and about 8 per cent of we kno,v not what?\" The judge, in summing up the case against the Siegert exploiters, also said that they had \"been guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentations in advertising and selling their bitters that they are not entitled to the protection of a court of equity.\" It is significant that some years previously (in 1890) in a similar equity case involving Angostura Bitters and tried before the New York Supreme Court the judge said : \"Neither of the litigants gave any evidence tending to show that the bitters prepared by them, respectively, possessed any medical qualities or had served any useful purpose except as an article of sale.\" And the court concluded: \"We do not think courts of equity should be swift or vigilant to protect the manufacturers of a compound advertised and sold as a valuable medicine, which is not shown to contain a single medical ingredient or to possess a single merit claimed for it, as against other manu\u00ad facturers producing and selling a like compound.\" At the time that the advertisements ref erred to in this article were being published, Siegert's Angostura Bitters carried a label declaring that it was \"made from pure rum containing about 45 per cent alcohol.\"-(Conde,ised from The Journal A. M. A., Sept. 23, 1922.) Lash's Bitters.-A physician in a middle western state wrote to The Journal A. M. A. in April 1921 stating that, a few days previously, he hag been called to see a patient who was suffering from chronic Bright's disease and cirrhosis (hardening) of the liver. As the doctor was leaving the house, the sick man's wife opened the closet door and showed the physician two gunny sacks filled with empty bottles of \"Lash's Bitters.\" There were ninety-one of these bottles in all. The doctor was told that the patient had consumed the contents of these ninety-one bottles between January 28 and March 5. At that time Lash's Bitters came in bottles containing 22 fluid ounces and the label declared the presence of 18 per cent of alcohol. A few years earlier Lash's Bitters had contained over 21 per cent alcohol, according to the state chemists of Connecticut who published a brief report on this nostrum in 1914. The report read in part: \"This popular bar-room bitters (our sample was purchased in a saloon) contains 21.46 per cent of alcohol and 'l .83 per cent of solids, with 2.42 per cent of vegetable etractives of a more or less laxative nature. The suggestive pictures used to advertise these bitters show it better fitted for the bar-room than the sick chamber.\" \u00b7 The interesting feature of the case recorded by the physician was the amount of Lash's Bitters that had been consumed by his patient. From January 28 to March 5, inclusive, there are 36 days and, as there were 91 bottles consumed in this time, the man was taking about 2\u00bd bottles of Lash's Bitters daily or 55 ounces of a mixture containing 18 per cent of alcohol. This would be equivalent to about 20 ounces of straight whiskey (50 per cent alcohol) every day.-(Condensed from The Journal A. M. A., April 9, 1921.) 212 TONICS, BITTERS, ETC. Peruna.-This has been dealt with at so many times and in so many places that that it would hardly seem worthwhile to discuss it again were it not for the fact that this alcoholic nostrum seems to have taken on a new lease of life due to radio advertising. Originally, Peruna contained about 27 per cent of alcohol and very little else of importance. In those days its use as a beverage in those parts of the country that were at that time nominally \"dry'' was notorious. Cases of acute and chronic alcoholism and even, in some cases, of death from its use were matters of record. More than 30 years ago (1905), the Office of Indian Affairs notified all Indian agents that the sale of Peruna to the Indians was absolutely prohibited: \"As a medicine, something else can be substituted; as an intoxicant, it has been found too tempting and effective.\" In the same year the Bureau of Internal Revenue classed Perona as an alcoholic compound with the result that old Doc Hartman, the millionaire owner of Peruna, found himself in the predicament of either having to have his stuff sold under a liquor license or to modify his formula in such a way that the product could no longer be used as a beverage. He chose the latter course and added sufficient senna to his formula to satisfy the Internal Revenue Department that Perona could no longer be used for beverage purposes. When the National Food and Drugs Act went into effect in 1907, requiring the declaration of the presence and amount of alcohol in all \"patent medicines,\" the Peruna labels showed that the alcohol content had been cut down from 27 per cent to 20 per cent. During the years of the Volstead act, the Peruna concern still further cut down the alcohol from 20 per cent to 12 per cent. This, however, was only for the domestic product; export Peruna still contained 20 per cent. Later, during the prohibition era-possibly due to the decline in sates-the manu\u00ad facturers of Peruna added 6 per cent of alcohol and took out the senna. They also took out golden seal which had for some years been one of the alleged ingredients. On the other hand, they added wild cherry, gentian and potassium iodide. As a matter of interest, the following tabulation shows the claims that have been made for the ingredients of Peruna at various stages of its career. Before the passage of the Food and Drugs Act, we have no record of any state\u00ad ments regarding its composition. Since that time, there have been the following different formulas claimed, not counting the changes in alcohol percentages: 1907 1910 1920 1927 1936 12% Alcohol 18% Alcohol 18% Turkey corn Turkey corn Turkey corn Turkey corn Malt extract Horse weed Horse weed Horse weed Horse weed Iron Ginger Ginger Ginger Ginger Buchu leaves Golden seal Golden seal Wild cherry Journal A.

TONICS, BITTERS, ETC. 213 Vita-Pep.-This was nominally marketed by the Vitamine Products Company of New York City but actually seems to have been put out by the Vitamine Food Company, Inc., of Westfield, Mass. The president of the Vitamine Food Company was Eugene Christian, whose activities are dealt with elsewhere in this book. Prospective purchasers of Vita-Pep were sent a lurid circular in which was reproduced, natural size, a one-pint bottle of Vita-Pep. One peculiarity was that although the label itself was reproduced natural size the statement on the repro\u00ad duction of the label, \"Alcohol 16 per cent,\" was in type three times greater in size Zestful New Health Tonic Restores Youthful \\ltality Rccammended reduced) of a circular advertising \"Vita-Pep.\" It is worth noting that the alcohol declaration on the label of a bottle of \"Vita-Pep\" is in 6 yoint, thin line, capital letters. The same leg_end in the circular here reproduced is, in the original, in 18 J?Olllt, black-face capital letters. One is justified in inferring that the aim of such adver\u00ad tising 1s to stress the alcohol content. than the type that appeared on the actual label I One could hardly help inferring that the idea was to emphasize to prospective purchasers the possibility of getting, during the prohibition era, a preparation containing 16 per cent of alcohol. Vita-Pep was said to contain sherry wine with an alcoholic strength of 16 per cent and also pepsin, rennin and vitamin B. Letters sent to prospective customers stated that when one took a half-wineglassful of Vita-Pep with a half-wineglassful of freshly pressed orange juice one would get an ample quantity of both vitamin 214 TONICS, BITTERS, ETC. B and vitamin C. The letters did not add, although they might have done so, that one would also get a \"kick\" almost equal to that to be had from \"two fingers\" of straight whisky. Vita-Pep was said to be '.'delightful in its effect\" and it was claimed that it \"takes away that tired, rundown feeling and makes one feel vigorous, healthy and strong.\" Purchasers of Vita-Pep were bombarded with follow-up letters urging them to place orders for Vita-Pep in dozen or half-dozen lots. The purchaser was also urged to let his friends know about Vita-Pep and it was suggested that he send in $45 and the addresses of five people to each of whom a case of Vita-Pep (12 pints) would be delivered, and the person who was sending the money would receive one case free. As persons are not in the habit of buying legitimate medicines by the case (12 pints) and as Vita-Pep contained nothing that would interfere with the beverage qualities of the sherry wine which was its essential ingredient, there was justification for believing that the exploitation of Vita-Pep was merely one more attempt to circumvent the National Prohibition Law.-(Comlensed from The Journal A. M. A., March 15, 1924.) Tona-Vina.-This was put on the market in 1920 and was introduced by the \"free sample\" method. In Toledo, for example, full-page newspaper advertise\u00ad ments notified the public that \"50,000 free bottles of Tona-Vin\" would be \"given away to prove the remarkable tonic effect of this famous medicine.\" The free bottles held one ounce of the preparation whose label admitted the presence of 18 per cent of alcohol. The label also declared that the sale or use of the prepara\u00ad tion for beverage purposes would render the vender liable to severe penalties I The liquid in the free-trial bottles tasted like wine to which had been added a dash of wild cherry and a suspicion of bitters. Full-sized bottles of Tona-Vin were purchased and turned over to the A. M. A. Chemical Laboratory with the request that they analyze it. The label stated that the preparation contained \"soluble iron and quinine, fluid extract of senna leaves, wild cherry and aromatics.\" The circular accompanying the trade package stated that nux vomica was one of the ingredients, although no mention of that drug was made on the label and the A. M. A. chemists were unable to find any trace of nux vomica or its alkaloids. The chemists found that the total alkaloids in Tona-Vin were about one-tenth of a grain to the fluid ounce and consisted chiefly of quinine. As the ordinary tonic dose for quinine is l\u00bd grains, a fluid ounce of Tona-Vin contained about one-fifteenth of a dose and in order to obtain a tonic dose of quinine the person would have had to drink the contents of nearly 1\u00bd bottles which would have been the equivalent in alcoholic content of about a half-pint of whisky. The amount of iron found by the chemists was less than one-tenth of a grain to the fluid ounce; hence, a dose of Tona-Vin contained about one-eleventh of a dose of iron. The amount of laxative present was inconsequential and the chemists summed up their report with a statement that in their opinion Tona-Vin was not sufficiently medicated to prevent its use in moderate amounts as a beverage. The company whose name appeared on the Tona-Vin label as the manufacturer was apparently a subsidiary of a concern which made soap and toilet articles.\u00ad ( Condensed from The Jounral A. M. A., Jan. 15, 1921.) VENEREAL REMEDIES In some countries, the advertising of \"patent medicines\" for the all~ged treat\u00ad ment of venereal diseases is prohibited by law. Some individual states have enacted laws prohibiting the publication of advertisements of venereal quackery, whether they apply to individuals claiming to treat venereal diseases or to drugs or devices for the alleged cure of such diseases. The American people were brought to a realization of the menace of the venereal nostrum at the time that the young men of the country were being drafted for service in the World War. Officials of the United States Department of Agriculture, through what was then known as the Bureau of Chemistry, conducted a campaign against products of the venereal nostrum type. Unfortunately, under the National Food and Drugs Act, the officials had no power to prohibit the sale of such preparations unless false, misleading or fraudulent claims were made for such products on or in the trade packages. However, a very large number of these pernicious preparations fell afoul of the law in this respect and the officials who were empowered to enforce the national law made hundreds of seizures in different parts of the United States of so-called cures for venereal diseases. In an informative bulletin sent out by the United States Department of Agriculture, it was pointed out that venereal nostrums were sold largely because of plausible but false claims regarding their curative effects and that many sufferers from dangerous contagious venereal diseases were led to believe that cures could be affected by these preparations. As a result, adequate treatment under com\u00ad petent medical supervision was neglected until permanent injury to health and even danger to life itself had resulted. Furthermore, the unfortunate victims became a menace to the public health because of the danger of others contracting the diseases from them. In this chapter, there are listed some of the many venereal nostrums which were seized under the charge that they were sold under false and fraudulent claims. It has seemed unnecessary to detail the composition of these venereal nostrums. Most of them of course contained oleoresins of copaiba and cubebs ; many contained santal oil. Others of the injection type contained such substances as zinc sulphate, carbolic acid and hydrastis (golden seal). Following the name of each \"patent medicine\" listed, there is put in parenthesis the\u00b7number of the Notice of Judgment and the year in which that Notice was issued declaring the product misbranded because of the claims made for it: Allan's Compound Extract of Sarsaparilla with 8601; NOSTRUMS C. G. Remedy 1920]. Columbia Short Stop [N. Pearls [N. 193S8; 1933]. S and Special 37'1'1 Association for Medico-Physical Research.-This was organ\u00ad ized in 1911 by the outstanding quack of the century-Albert Abrams-under the earlier name \"The American Association for Spondylotherapy.\" Spondylotherapy was a cult created by Abrams before he went into his so-called \"Electronic Reactions\" which brought him so much notoriety and aIIowed him to die a millionaire. Spondylotherapy was a hybrid of up-stage chiropractic and osteopathy. Abrams at that time was convinced that manipulation of the spine was the shortest way to rescue the patient from suffering and the doctor from poverty. It was later that he turned the victim over and decided that the abdomen offered a more fertile field. The American Association for Medico-Physical Research had three classes of members: Fellows, Associates and Honorary Members; qualifications for Fellowship were graduation froin a recognized medical coIIege, the legal right to practice medicine and surgery and membership \"in good standing with their local or national medical society.\" If the latter meant the American Medical Association or its component branches, then a study of the programs and the publications of this organization indicated that these alleged qualifications were to be taken only in a Pickwickian sense. A study of some of the annual programs indicated that the American Asso\u00ad ciation for Medico-Physical Research might have been expected to sponsor every physio-therapy fad from the Abrams cult up-or down.-(From The J 01m1al A. M. A. Sept. 19, 1925.) American Medical Liberty League.-It was in 1910 that the speciously named \"National League for Medical Freedom\" began its intensive campaign against scientific medicine in general and the American Medical Association in particular. Engineered and inspired by nostrum exploiters and those opposed to pure food laws, aided and abetted by the followers of various cults, the League for Medical Freedom blazed its rocket-like course. across the medical firmament -and, in due time, the stick came down I Doubtless there was good money in it for someone while it lasted. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars, were expended in advertising. But its effort was abortive because the movement was fundamentally wrong-headed and the good sense of the American people, pene\u00ad trating the motives that were behind it, rejected it. After the National League for Medical Freedom went out of existence, there came into being another organization less heavily financed, but still, doubtless, one that produced a living for those who engineered it. It was called the \"American Medical Liberty League.\" This concern did little, if any, newspaper advertising. It did, however, get out a set of leaflets and pamphlets, which those, who were for one reason or another opposed to scientific medicine, purchased and distributed. The following partial list indicates the type of \"literature\" that was sold: \"Medical Health Officers Syphilizing the Nation\": This leaflet declared that all vaccine virus shows the reaction of congenital syphilis and \"even the vaccine scars show its contamination.\" The leaflet quoted as its authority for this charge Albert Abrams, A.M., LL.D., M.D. (Heidelberg), F.R.M.S. MISCELLANY 219 \"Toxin-antitoxin-How It Kills and Cripples Children.\": This purported to be a \"Detailed Story of the Horrible Results Following a Texas Serum Cam\u00ad paign.\" \"The American Medical Liberty Leagi4e\": This professed to tell what the \"League\" was, \"Why you need it\" and, in large bold-faced capital letters, \"How TO WORK IT!\" \"The Going of Cumming\": While this was said to be \"Paragraphs on the Enlightenment of Calf Pus Cult,\" it was, in reality, a tirade against Surgeon\u00ad General Hugh S. Cumming. \"Know the Facts About V accinatio11,\": This was an alleged compilation of \"statistics and expert testimony\" brought together by Lora C. Little and reprinted by permission from Dr. George Starr White's \"Lecture Course to Physicians.\" These were but a few of the pieces of propaganda that were sent out by the American Medical Liberty League. At their headquarters they also handed out to those interested, a reprint from the Litullahr M agasiue ( which was the house\u00ad organ of a so-called \"nature-cure institute\") telling of the marvels of the \"elec\u00ad tronic diagnosis and treatment\" of Albert Abrams I They handed out, too, the Central States Osteopath, the official organ of the Illinois and Wisconsin osteopaths. The American Medical Liberty League was brought into existence in the latter part of 1918. Lora C. Little, who seemed to be the moving spirit of the organization, was listed officially as its \"secretary.\" In November, 1918, there was sent out a mimeographed letter headed: \"STRICTI.Y PERSONAL AND CONFI\u00ad DENTIAL.\" It stated, in effect, that with the coming of peace there would \"burst forth\" what was described as \"long-pent feeling over medical outrages, committed wholesale the past two years. . . . \" Further, this bursting would give a grand opportunity to the believers in \"medical freedom\" to make a killing. \"Two big things\" would be necessary to \"meet the situation\" : first, \"a full exposure, backed by an array of authentic facts\" which must be, \"when the proper time has come, widely distributed\"; second, \"a definite program of action.\" Then came the nub. To accomplish these \"two big things\" funds were required; hence, the appeal for 11membership\" in the American Medical Liberty League, price $2.00 a year, \"which covers subscription to the Truth Teller.\" According to the letter, ten individuals in any locality who joined the \"League\" and paid their annual fees might organize a \"Local League.\" The League's official organ, was the Truth-Teller-ironical name I This some\u00ad what lurid sheet was 11published semimonthly by the Truth-Teller Publishing Company at 38 N. Division St., Battle Creek, Mich.\" The Battle Creek tele\u00ad phone directory did not show any company of this name, but it did list the \"Ensign Printing Co.\" at 38 N. Division St. The editor of the Truth-Teller was given as vV. S. Ensign, who put after his name the mystic abbreviation \"Phys. et Pat. Ch.\" Its \"Associate Editor\" was Wilhelm Heinrich Schwartz, M.D.; its D. W. Ensign and its \"Traveling Repre\u00ad sentative\" was Thomas D. Ensign ; in short, it seemed to be largely an Ensign publication. The Truth-Teller stated that it kept no subscription books but, those who received a copy of it regularly, could \"rest assured that the subscription price of same has been paid.\" The Truth-Teller seems to have been known previously as The Peril (\"America's Weekly Journal. Devoted to Homeopathy and Humanity\") which, in turn, was originally called America's Homeopathic News, edited by Wilhelm Heinrich Schwartz, M.D., \"Vice-President of the International Anti-Vivisection and Cruelty to Animals Congress,\" etc., etc. W. S. Ensign, \"Phys. et Pat. Ch.\" Battle Creek, Mich., editor of the Truth\u00ad Teller and Mrs. Little, apparently were important factors in the American Medical 220 MISCELLANY Liberty League. Presidents, vice-presidents and treasurers seemed to change, as did also some of the directors, but through all W. S. Ensign and Lora C. W. Little continued as \"Editor\" of the official organ and \"Secretary\" of the organ\u00ad ization, respectively. W. S. Ensign for some years did a mail-order business in Ensign Remedies. The Ensign Remedies were good for whatever ailed you. Apparently there were hundreds of them and they were known by numbers. Ensign therapy was a comparatively simple study. A booklet issued by the Ensign Remedies Com\u00ad pany listed all \"Diseases and Their Cure.\" These were very easy. For Peritonitis, one took \"748A and B\"; for Alcoholism, \"Tapers should use No. 17\"; for Appendicitis, '.'Use No. 758A and B for the acute attack\"; for Diphtheria, \"No. 675A and B is our specific treatment Do not use anti-toxin.\" Should you have Atrophy of the Optic Nerve, you took \"No. 521A and B\"; for Cataract, \"No. 540A and B\" indicated. Yellow .t Pal. flh. 'II. B. SCHWARTZ, X. D. D, W, E!CSION Editor AuMtate Editor N&DASID&' Editor B,:prueataU'rO It will be noticed that the Trut~Teller seemed to be an Ensign institution. for \"342F.\" Bright's Disease was cured with \"854A and B,\" but one must be sure to have the figures right, as uNo. 857 A and B\" was for Floating Kidney. For Lockjaw one took Housemaid's Knee. The Ensign Remedies were good also for more than physical ailments. The public was told that 11in the absolute cure of diseases of the mind, nothing equals the Ensign Remedies.\" Were you troubled with \"Bashfulness,\" take \"No. 186A and B\"; did you see \"Animals or Reptiles\" (pink elephants, for instance) try \"No. 187 A and B.\" For \"Outness and Stupidity, No. 189A and B\"; for \"Dis\u00ad appointment in Love, No. 192A and B.\" For mere \"Laziness, Lack of Ambition, No. 196A and B\"; should you have a \"Desire for Light and Company\" take \"No. 197A.\" Some years ago the state officials of Michigan analyzed some of Ensign's various cures and published the results in the official bulletin, Fakes and Frauds. Ensign's \"Appendicitis Cure\" was reported to show on analysis sugar 100 per cent; Ensign's \"Pneumonia Cure\" was another 100 per cent sugar product, while Ensign's \"Hay Fever Cure\" had the same composition. The Michigan author\u00ad ities unkindly called attention to the fact that while these remedies sold at $1.00 each, their estimated cost was less than \u00bdo of a cent. MISCELLANY 221 Mrs. Lora C. Little, who seemed to have had much to do with the organiza\u00ad tion of the League, apparently hailed from the Pacific Coast, where she was said to have been a traveling lecturer whose business it was to create sentiment against vaccination. Mrs. Little contributed prolifically to the League's house\u00ad organ, -the Truth-Teller. In addition to being \"Secretary\" of the American Medical Liberty League, Mrs. Little was also listed as \"Secretary\" and \"Official Organizer\" of the \"Central Health Committee of the State of Illinois.\" There was the usual proportion of names of chiropractors, etc., on the letterheads of the official stationery of the \"committee.\" This \"committee,\" too; solicited funds\u00ad \"for\u00b7 the purpose of securing medical liberty in the new Illinois constitution\"\u00ad and made a special plea that the persons circularized should help secure for a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, the nomination and election of a certain Chicago lawyer who would \"stand to the last ditch for our principle.\" The lawyer's name appeared later as one of the \"directors\" of the \"American Medical Liberty League.\" He was not elected. The \"League\" also had \"State Vice-Presidents.\" It would consume too much space to take up the various individuals whose names appeared as state vice\u00ad presidents and publish the details on file regarding these persons. However, it is worthy of note that the State Vice-President of California was Dr. George Starr White, dealt with elsewhere in this book. 'Ille ~R~~!~~pauy \"THE ENSIGN REMEDIES\" W.S.CH&IGtf.F'ftpaCt- of the Ensign Remedies Compan7, a concern which Love.'' \"Floating Kidney,\" \"Laziness,' \"Locomotor Ataxia\" and many other conditions. Part of the propaganda against tuberculin testing of cattle issued by the American Medical Liberty League was an article by George Starr White, and several instances came to the attention of the American Medical Association in \u00b7 which, when an organized fight was being made in the state legislatures against the tuberculin testing of cattle, the statements of George Starr White were \u00b7 solemnly quoted as though they came from a reputable source and meant something. -(Condensed from The Journal A. M.A., July 29, 1922.) Medical Society of the United States.-As originally planned, this society seems to have been based on the idea of organizing the \"fee-splitters.\" In 1916 the birth of the \"society'' was announced to the medical profession through a letter written on the stationery of the. \"Medical Society of the United States.\" The letter read in part : \"We-the majority of the medical profession-who believe in division of fees (i. e., that the surgeon should not 'hog' the whole of a patient's money and leave nothing for the family doctor), are no longer welcome in the A. M. A. We are therefore organizing the Medical Society of the United States, which will not be conducted for the benefit of a few selfish egotists, We would like to have you with us. \"It costs only $1.00 to join. This covers dues for 1916, and includes expense for the beautiful certificate of membership (suitable for framing), which you will receive on admission. Fill enclosed blank and return to me with $1.00. 222 MISCELLANY But presumably the idea of organizing on a basis of \"fee splitting\" did not make a hit, so the lure was changed. Later physicians were approached with the plea that the \"Medical Society of the United States\" would make the medical world free for democracy; it was, physicians were assured, a \"Society of Protest Against the Autocracy of the A. M. A.,\" and a \"Society of Medical Democracy!' Membership still cost \"only $LOO including the cost of a beautiful cer\u00ad tificate of membership.\" No penalties or punishments were involved for belong\u00ad ing to other societies, in fact : \"Joining our body need not affect your membership in any other society-even the A. M. A., if you wish to belong to it . . .\" One of the parents of this \"society\" seems to have been the editor and proprietor of the St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal, a publication which espoused the interests of the nostrum makers. Advertising pages, \"original articles\" and \"editorials\"-all were used to puff nostrums of the crudest type. It was this journal that came to the defense of the \"patent medicine\" interests when they were so hard hit by Mr. Adams' \"Great American Fraud\" series. In com\u00ad menting on activities, Collier's, in January, 1907, said: \"Headache powders came in for a considerable share of attention in the patent medicine articles. There was much talk of libel among the headache powder makers, but they decided upon the safer methods of hiring a meretricious medical publication, the St. Louis Medical and Surgical Journal, to print an article in which the Collier's statements were branded as lies, and the Collier's editors and writers as liars and libelers. This article the Proprietary Associa\u00ad tion of America circulated in pamphlet form. The journal which printed it died a natural death a few weeks later.\" At the time that the Medical Society of the United States was being organized -in 1916-there was published what purported to be a preliminary program of its first meeting. The meeting was held in St. Louis, and the program, while containing the names of men with special fads or interests to exploit, also con\u00ad tained the names of some men of standing. It appeared, however, on investigation, that at least some of the latter had but the haziest conception of the use to which their names were being put, and protested vigorously on learning the facts, repudiating the organization. In 1918 another meeting was held. The program at that time contained many names that characterized the organization. Such names were of men who, pro\u00ad f essionally speaking, ranged from faddists, who rode grotesque and bizarre medical hobbies, to those who, with special interests to exploit and unable to use reputable medical organizations for that purpose, had taken refuge in such a hybrid conglomeration as the Medical Society of the United States. Not that the program contained the names of crude quacks, or obvious medical swindlers. It was representative, rather, of that twilight zone of professionalism, the penum\u00ad bra, in whose uncertain light it is difficult to distinguish between the unbalanced visionary with a fad, and the more sinister near-quack, with a \"scheme.\"-(Con\u00ad densed from The Journal A.
