What is a vaccine delivery system? How do vaccines work? vaccine, [suspension](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/suspension) of weakened, killed, or fragmented microorganisms or [toxins](https://www.britannica.com/science/toxin) or other biological preparation, such as those consisting of [antibodies](https://www.britannica.com/science/antibody), [lymphocytes](https://www.britannica.com/science/lymphocyte), or messenger RNA (mRNA), that is administered primarily to prevent [disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/disease). A vaccine can confer [active immunity](https://www.britannica.com/science/active-immunization) against a specific harmful agent by stimulating the [immune system](https://www.britannica.com/science/immune-system) to attack the agent. Once stimulated by a vaccine, the antibody-producing cells, called [B cells](https://www.britannica.com/science/B-cell) (or [B lymphocytes](https://www.britannica.com/science/B-cell)), remain sensitized and ready to respond to the agent should it ever gain entry to the body. A vaccine may also confer [passive immunity](https://www.britannica.com/science/passive-immunization) by providing antibodies or lymphocytes already made by an animal or human donor. Vaccines are usually [administered](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/administered) by injection (parenteral administration), but some are given orally or even nasally (in the case of flu vaccine). Vaccines applied to mucosal surfaces, such as those lining the [gut](https://www.britannica.com/science/gastrointestinal-tract) or nasal passages, seem to stimulate a greater [antibody](https://www.britannica.com/science/antibody) response and may be the most effective route of administration. (For further information, see [immunization](https://www.britannica.com/science/immunization).) The first vaccines The [first vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/smallpox-vaccine) was introduced by British physician [Edward Jenner](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-Jenner), who in 1796 used the cowpox [virus](https://www.britannica.com/science/virus) (vaccinia) to confer protection against [smallpox](https://www.britannica.com/science/smallpox), a related virus, in humans. Prior to that use, however, the principle of vaccination was applied by Asian physicians who gave children dried crusts from the lesions of people suffering from smallpox to protect against the disease. While some developed immunity, others developed the disease. Jenner's contribution was to use a substance similar to, but safer than, smallpox to confer immunity. He thus exploited the relatively rare situation in which immunity to one virus confers protection against another [viral disease](https://www.britannica.com/science/viral-disease). In 1881 French microbiologist [Louis Pasteur](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Louis-Pasteur) demonstrated immunization against [anthrax](https://www.britannica.com/science/anthrax-disease) by injecting [sheep](https://www.britannica.com/animal/domesticated-sheep) with a preparation containing [attenuated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attenuated) forms of the bacillus that causes the disease. Four years later he developed a protective suspension against [rabies](https://www.britannica.com/science/rabies). Vaccine effectiveness After Pasteur's time, a widespread and intensive search for new vaccines was conducted, and vaccines against both [bacteria](https://www.britannica.com/science/bacteria) and [viruses](https://www.britannica.com/science/virus) were produced, as well as vaccines against [venoms](https://www.britannica.com/science/venom) and other toxins. Through vaccination, [smallpox](https://www.britannica.com/science/smallpox) was [eradicated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eradicated) worldwide by 1980, and [polio](https://www.britannica.com/science/polio) cases declined by 99 percent. Other examples of diseases for which vaccines have been developed types of [encephalitis](https://www.britannica.com/science/encephalitis), and [typhus](https://www.britannica.com/science/typhus)\u2014although some of those vaccines are less than 100 percent effective or are used only in populations at high risk. Vaccines against viruses provide especially important immune protection, since, unlike bacterial infections, viral infections do not respond to [antibiotics](https://www.britannica.com/science/antibiotic). [ Britannica Quiz Is There a Doctor in the House? Firsts in Medicine Quiz ](/quiz/is-there-a-doctor-in-the-house-firsts-in-medicine-quiz) Vaccine types The challenge in vaccine development consists in devising a vaccine strong enough to ward off infection without making the individual seriously ill. To that end, researchers have [devised](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/devised) different types of vaccines. Weakened, or [attenuated](https://www.britannica.com/science/attenuation-immunization), vaccines consist of microorganisms that have lost the ability to cause serious illness but retain the ability to stimulate immunity. They may produce a mild or subclinical form of the disease. Attenuated vaccines include those for mumps, [polio](https://www.britannica.com/science/polio) (the [Sabin vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/Sabin-vaccine)), [rubella](https://www.britannica.com/science/rubella), and tuberculosis. Inactivated vaccines are those that contain organisms that have been killed or inactivated with [heat](https://www.britannica.com/science/heat) or chemicals. Inactivated vaccines elicit an immune response, but the response often is less complete than with attenuated vaccines. Because inactivated vaccines are not as effective at fighting infection as those made from attenuated microorganisms, greater quantities of inactivated vaccines are administered. Vaccines against [rabies](https://www.britannica.com/science/rabies), polio (the [Salk vaccine](https://www.britannica.com/science/Salk-vaccine)), some forms of [influenza](https://www.britannica.com/science/influenza), and [cholera](https://www.britannica.com/science/cholera) are made from inactivated microorganisms. Another type of vaccine is a subunit vaccine, which is made from [proteins](https://www.britannica.com/science/protein) found on the surface of [infectious](https://www.britannica.com/science/infectious-disease) agents. Vaccines for influenza and hepatitis B are of that type. When toxins, the metabolic by-products of infectious organisms, are inactivated to form [toxoids](https://www.britannica.com/science/toxoid), they can be used to stimulate immunity against [tetanus](https://www.britannica.com/science/tetanus-disease), [diphtheria](https://www.britannica.com/science/diphtheria), and [whooping cough](https://www.britannica.com/science/whooping-cough) (pertussis). In the late 20th century, advances in laboratory techniques allowed approaches to vaccine development to be refined. Medical researchers could identify the [genes](https://www.britannica.com/science/gene) of a [pathogen](https://www.britannica.com/science/pathogen) (disease-causing microorganism) that [encode](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/encode) the [protein](https://www.britannica.com/science/protein) or proteins that stimulate the immune response to that organism. That allowed the immunity-stimulating proteins (called [antigens](https://www.britannica.com/science/antigen)) to be mass-produced and used in vaccines. It also made it possible to alter pathogens genetically and produce weakened strains of [viruses](https://www.britannica.com/science/virus). In that way, harmful proteins from pathogens can be deleted or modified, thus providing a safer and more-effective method by which to manufacture attenuated vaccines. [Recombinant DNA technology](https://www.britannica.com/science/recombinant-DNA-technology) has also proven useful in developing vaccines to viruses that cannot be grown successfully or that are inherently dangerous. Genetic material that codes for a desired [antigen](https://www.britannica.com/science/antigen) is inserted into the [attenuated](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/attenuated) form of a large virus, such as the [vaccinia](https://www.britannica.com/science/cowpox) virus, which carries the foreign genes \"piggyback.\" The altered virus is injected into an individual to stimulate antibody production to the foreign proteins and thus confer immunity. The approach potentially enables the vaccinia virus to function as a live vaccine against several diseases, once it has received genes derived from the relevant disease-causing microorganisms. A similar procedure can be followed using a modified bacterium, such as Salmonella typhimurium, as the carrier of a foreign gene. Vaccines against [human papillomavirus](https://www.britannica.com/science/human-papillomavirus) (HPV) are made from viruslike particles (VLPs), which are prepared via recombinant [technology](https://www.britannica.com/technology/technology). The vaccines do not contain live HPV biological or genetic material and therefore are incapable of causing infection. Two types of HPV vaccines have been developed, including a bivalent HPV vaccine, made using VLPs of HPV types 16 and 18, and a tetravalent vaccine, made with VLPs of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. Another approach, called naked DNA therapy, involves injecting [DNA](https://www.britannica.com/science/DNA) that [encodes](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/encodes) a foreign protein into [muscle](https://www.britannica.com/science/muscle) cells. The cells produce the foreign antigen, which stimulates an immune response. Vaccines based on RNA have been of particular interest as a means of preventing diseases such as [influenza](https://www.britannica.com/science/influenza), [cytomegalovirus](https://www.britannica.com/science/cytomegalovirus) infection, and [rabies](https://www.britannica.com/science/rabies). [Messenger RNA](https://www.britannica.com/science/messenger-RNA) (mRNA) vaccines are advantageous because the way in which they are made allows them to be developed more quickly than vaccines made via other methods. In addition, their production can be standardized, enabling rapid scale-up for the manufacture of large quantities of vaccine. Novel mRNA vaccines are safe and effective; they do not contain live virus, nor does the RNA interact with human DNA.
