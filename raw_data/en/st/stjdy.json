This article is forecasting a growth of 18% in the sale of homeopathic remedies owing to an increasing awareness of the law of similars and a desire to avoid expensive and invasive treatments. \"Modern medical science has witnessed a sharp upward trend that considers symptoms as adaptive body responses. Increasing awareness of the \"law of similars\" has promoted the use of homeopathy products that use highly diluted small doses of natural ingredients in order to trigger the healing abilities of the human body. In addition, people have been shifting away from invasive treatments wherever possible owing to the high costs and physical strain associated with these procedures. Homeopathy, being a non-invasive treatment with zero stress and strain has gained sufficient traction since the past several years. Realizing the widespread acceptance of the homeopathy treatment sector, FactMR analysis says that the global market for homeopathy products is meant to witness stellar growth during the period of assessment. Largely driven by a growing awareness regarding the effectiveness of homeopathy as a mainstream treatment for several disorders, the sale of homeopathy products has risen considerably. Moreover, more than 1,000,000 thousand units of homeopathy products is expected to be sold by the end of 2026. Invasive treatments to cure disorders and malignancies are considered as a last resort by people, who are more focused on using alternative medications such as naturopathy and homeopathy. With growing demand for medications that are to be consumed orally, supported by increasing preference for orally administered medications and drugs that are exempt of side effects, consumption of homeopathy products is set to increase in the coming years. Allopathy also includes strong drugs, that are not suitable for every individual. Moreover, with respect to costing, allopathic medications are highly priced and showcase temporary effect on the illnesses. The illness can return even after the dosage of the prescribed drug is over. Cases of drug abuse is another fact, owing to which people are shifting towards natural medications. Homeopathy products offer preventive measures, boost immune systems, are inexpensive and do not have side effects. This is expected to spur the sales of homeopathy products in the years to follow.\" [https://www.factmr.com/report/604/homeopathy-products-market](https://www.factmr.com/report/604/homeopathy-products-market) Posted in "}
