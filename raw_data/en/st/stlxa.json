Dr. Hahn's research has focused on mitochondrial disorders, metabolic disorders, population screening for Wilsons disease, Cystinosis and Primary immunodeficiencies ( [https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/centers-programs/integrative-brain-research/our-labs/hahn-lab/](https://www.seattlechildrens.org/research/centers-programs/integrative-brain-research/our-labs/hahn-lab/)). His ultimate goal is to develop and validate a specific and quantitative proteomic assay that will simultaneously identify multiple congenital disorders using a small volume of blood dried onto filter paper as newborn screening. Dr. Hahn serves as a member of medical advisory committee of the Wilson Disease Association. Wilson Disease is a genetic disease in which the body cannot excrete copper properly leading to its accumulation in various organs including the liver and brain. Dr. Hahn developed and validated clinical genetic test on mitochondrial disorders by high-throughput next generation sequencing technology. Other current projects in his lab focus on developing peptide finger printing analysis by tandem mass spectrometry for various metabolic and genetic disorders including cystinosis and primary immunodeficiencies. Dr. Hahn hopes to improve clinical practice through integrated laboratory testing true translational research. He remains a great believer in prevention: identifying illness and providing interventions to patients before symptoms appear is always preferable to treating developed disease. He is a member of advisory committee for Washington State Newborn Screening. - Related Pages - The Hahn laboratory focuses on development and validation of assays that have important clinical applications for population screening, diagnosis and prognosis. - - - Award Name Award Description Awarded By Award Date National Research Service Award NIH 1990 - 1992 Travel Award International Congress of Inborn Errors of Metabolism 1994 Luminex Award Luminex Award Grant - $100,000 American College of Medical Genetics 2009 - Manuscripts in Refereed Journals - Eun SH, Hahn SHMetabolic evaluation of children with global developmental delay. 25932032 Korean journal of pediatrics, 2015 April : 58(4)117-22 PMCID:PMC4414625 - Schilsky ML, Roberts EA, Hahn choices for treating Wilson's disease. 25524500 Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.), 2015 April : 61(4)1106-8 - Paciorkowski AR, McDaniel SS, Jansen LA, Tully H, Tuttle E, Ghoneim DH, Tupal S, Gunter SA, mutations in ATP1A3 associated with catastrophic early life epilepsy, episodic prolonged apnea, and postnatal microcephaly. 25656163 Hahn SHTargeted mitochondrial disorders reveals high genetic heterogeneity.

The work focuses on developing a newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry for Wilson's disease, a genetic disease in which the body cannot excrete copper properly leading to its accumulation in various organs including the liver and brain. I am developing an assay that quickly determines if the mitochondrial disease is present. I hope to improve clinical practice through integrated laboratory testing-true translational research. - Research Focus Area - Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, Genetics and Developmental Biology, Biochemical Genetics, Mitochondrial disease "}
