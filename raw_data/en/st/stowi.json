Unfortunately, the now all too common stresses of daily life often lead to listlessness, sleep deprivation, memory loss, and a weakened immune system. These symptoms can reflect an imbalance in our overall health and well-being that often requires more than a quick afternoon trip to the spa. Through the extended Ayurveda Panchakarma treatment, available via one of our monthly retreats, the imbalanced, unhealthful life can be truly restored in full. As part of a focus on holistic wellness, this ancient restorative method involves improving upon all aspects of health, including conscious eating, mediation, exercise, cleansing, and relaxation. Plus, the Ayurveda Panchakarma treatment offers more than just the benefit of time away from reoccurring stresses. As listed in the five following benefits, this revitalizing yet customizable measure can transform specific qualities of life with lasting effects. Detoxification The first part of the Ayurveda Panchakarma treatment is the removal of toxins from the body, known as purvakarma. Through our simple oil massage detoxification procedure, the nervous system, circulatory system, and digestive system can once again achieve balance, along with physiological equilibrium to provide a restoration of comfort and energy. Detoxification additionally reduces excess fat, increases skin glow, increases mental clarity, and diminishes anxiety and insomnia. Detoxifying oil massages are followed by herbal sauna sessions that further loosen toxins in the body. Meditation and Yoga As part of our process, meditation and yoga are often employed to help rebuild tissue and strength after the release of harmful wastes and toxins. Meditation and yoga further help with the digestion of the whole foods and herbs you'll eat as part of the nutritional aspect of the treatment. Both mediation and yoga aid with mental clarity and strength, and the best part is that these techniques can be integrated into daily life beyond the spa. Pulse Assessment As part of our treatment you'll experience the ancient and time-tested art of pulse diagnosis, an Ayurveda technique that gives precise insight into imbalances among the three energies (or doshas) of the body through reading the pulse. With this information at hand, individuals are now better able to monitor key aspects of their health. Restoration of Sleep Patterns As sleep is perhaps the most indicative symptom of imbalance and a frequent consequence of stress, the Ayurveda Panchakarma treatment places significant emphasis upon restoring this cycle. Resulting from a combination of daily massage, meditation and relaxation therapies, along with exercise and structured sleep schedules, a natural sleep cycle will be in full swing by the end of your retreat. Personal Wellness Routine With the help of our knowledgeable staff, you will soon be on your way to a personalized, more effective wellness routine to meet the needs of your body. Our Ayurveda Panchakarma retreat is unique for just this reason, as we understand that each individual requires different exercise regiments, nutritional diets, and routines. "}
