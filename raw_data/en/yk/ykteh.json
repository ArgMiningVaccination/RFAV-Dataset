Traditionally, an inactivated or attenu- ated pathogen may have been used as a vaccine, whereas mRNA and DNA vaccines provide genetic material that instruct the body's cells to produce a viral spike protein antigen. Presently, both mRNA vaccines are approved for use as a two-dose sched- ule given either 21 days or 28 days apart. However, Tonia Tauh, MD, FRCPC, Michelle Mozel, MSc, Paula Meyler, MD, FRCPC, Susan M. Lee, MAS, MD, FRCPC What is the evidence for extending the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine dosing schedule? With off-label COVID-19 vaccine dosing being widely used as a way to increase the number of people receiving their first dose, and hearing physicians' concerns about the safety of such a practice, a research group at Royal Columbian Hospital in British Columbia undertook an analysis of the data, published and unpublished, and conclude that a longer gap between doses is likely warranted given the circumstances.

This article has been peer reviewed. there is a relative scarcity of vaccine compared to the population of British Columbia. BC's public health officials have proposed a delay between the primary vaccination and booster to 35 days from the recommended 21 and 28 days. Based on unpublished data available to the National Advisory Committee on Immunization through Health Canada for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, there was no difference in vac - cine efficacy between the people who got their second dose at day 19 and the people who got it at day 42. Various jurisdictions around the world are permitting a prolonged second dosing inter - val. Despite the paucity of clinical trial data, it is likely that increasing the interval between the first and second doses of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna is safe, both in the intervening period between doses and for long-term efficacy. Extending the vaccine schedule is likely warranted in order to allow the widest population to receive the first dose. A successful vaccination strategy against SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) may be a cornerstone in the resolution of the current pandemic. If it is to be effective, an ef- ficient vaccination rollout is important as the epidemic puts extreme pressure on health ser- vices. A rapid vaccine rollout has many road- blocks, from some people's initial hesitancy to receive a novel vaccine to supply chain dis-tribution challenges. If we are to contain and control the outbreak, we must establish from data that the vaccines are not only safe but also effective and widely available. With the current limitations on vaccine supply, our society must balance vaccinating as many people as possible in short order with the strict timing recommen- dations for the vaccines as they were designed and studied. As such, a question has arisen by patients and providers alike: to what degree can we alter the recommended dosing regimen without impacting effectiveness?68 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 2 | march 202168CliniC al What is the evidence for extending the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine dosing schedule? What are mRNA and DNA vaccines? Traditionally, an inactivated or attenuated patho- gen may have been used as a vaccine. In contrast, novel mRNA (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) and DNA (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vaccines pro- vide genetic material that instruct the body's cells to produce a viral spike protein antigen. This antigen, which cannot cause disease, will go on to elicit an immune response. As the cells produce the antigen, antibodies will neu- tralize the whole virus. Further, later infection may activate memory T cells to generate an early antibody response to attenuate infection.1 While the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are new, mRNA vaccines have been in develop - ment for many years. However, since the Mod- erna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are the first mRNA vaccines to be widely used, little is known about their side effects, long-term ef- ficacy, or the effect of off-label dosing schedules. What dosing schedules for COVID-19 vaccines are approved based on clinical trial data? Presently, both mRNA vaccines (Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech) are approved for use as a two-dose schedule given either 21 days (Pfizer-BioNTech)2,3 or 28 days (Moderna)4 apart. Upon administration of the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, partial immunity is acquired against severe COVID-19 symp- toms, typically by 7 days, with 52.4% efficacy between 7 to 14 days and 89% between days 15 to 21 after dose 1. Protection continues to climb to 92.6% for the Pfizer-BioNTech vac- cine after the second dose.2 Of note, single-dose efficacy was not a primary outcome of the trial, but rather extrapolated by subgroup analysis and thus based on fewer data.2,3 The Moderna vaccine showed 50.8% efficacy of the first dose on days 1 to 14 and 92.1% efficacy at 14 or more days after the first dose (80.2% overall after dose 1).4,5 No clinical trials have been able to judge how long immunogenicity lasts following one dose, but we do know that efficacy after the first dose increases with time until the second dose is administered. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is a DNA vaccine via an adenovirus vector, is still under review and is not approved for use in Canada. The first and second doses were scheduled 28 days apart in the Phase 2/3 clinical trial. A single-dose regimen was also included in the study, although it showed lower neutralizing antibody titres than the two-dose regimen.6,7 What data exist on deviations from approved dosing schedules?Unpublished data from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna and published Oxford-AstraZeneca dosing interval trials demonstrate patient level data on longer dosing intervals. Based on un- published data available to the National Ad- visory Committee on Immunization through Health Canada for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, there was no difference in vaccine efficacy between the people who got their second dose at day 19 and the people who got it at day 42.8,9 Importantly, there was no decrease in protection between the first dose and the second dose. Similarly, the trials of the Oxford-Astra- Zeneca vaccine did include different spacing between doses and found that a longer gap (2 to 3 months) led to a greater immune re - sponse, but the overall participant numbers were small.6,7 In the UK study, 59% (1407 of 2377) of the participants who had two standard doses received the second dose between 9 and 12 weeks after the first. In the Brazilian study, only 18.6% (384 of 2063) received a second dose between 9 and 12 weeks after the first. The combined trial results found that vaccine efficacy at 14 days post-dose 2 was higher in the group with more than 6 weeks between doses than in the group with less than 6 weeks between doses (65.4% vs. 53.4%). 6,7What do governing bodies around the world recommend?The unpublished data from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna and published data from Oxford-AstraZeneca on dosing intervals gave several consensus groups reason to advocate for a prolonged dosing interval up to 42 days (6 weeks). The British Society of Immunology stated that, \"Most immunologists would agree that delaying a second 'booster' dose of a pro- tein antigen vaccine (such as the two approved COVID-19 vaccines [Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca]) by 8 weeks would be unlikely to have a negative effect on the overall immune response post-boost. We also would not expect any specific safety issues to arise for the individual due to delaying the second dose, other than an increased potential risk of disease during the extended period due to lowered protection.\"10 In an attempt to extend the initial phases of vaccination to a larger proportion of people, the Joint Committee on Vaccines and Immuniza- tion, along with the UK Chief Medical Officers have approved a prolonged second dosing inter- val up to 12 weeks for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines.11,12 The WHO has suggested that \"...extending dose 2 up to 42 days may not be unreasonable.\"13 The US CDC has stated that there is no maximum interval be - tween first and second doses for either vaccine.14 The Table summarizes current recommen- dations from various regulating bodies. The US FDA and Pfizer-BioNTech have both main- tained that the clinically tested dosing sched-ule should be followed. 2,15 The Government of Canada advocates for maintaining the recom- mended dosing schedule; however, it states, \"If, due to logistical constraints, jurisdictions cannot complete the two-dose COVID-19 vaccine series as close as possible to the authorized or alternative schedules outlined in Table 2, they may refer to Appendix C for a summary of con- siderations and options on ethics, equity, feasi- bility and acceptability summarized in NACI's Core Ethical Dimensions Filter of the EEFA Framework and the accompanying ethics analy- sis.\"16 BC Provincial Health Officer Dr Bonnie Henry has announced extending the second dosing of both vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) to 35 days.17Trials of the Oxford-Astra-Zeneca vaccine did include different spacing between doses and found that a longer gap (2 to 3 months) led to a greater immune response.69 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 2 | March 202169Summary and recommendation Upon learning that off-label vaccine dosing was being proposed in British Columbia, and hearing that physicians were concerned about the safety of such a practice, our research group at Royal Columbian Hospital in British Co- lumbia undertook our own analysis of the data, published and unpublished. While new data may arise in the future that will challenge these conclusions, based on our analysis of current- ly available data, we support British Colum- bia's decision to extend the dosing interval of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines from 21/28 days to 35 days for the following reasons: There are inadequate vaccine supplies to maintain the maximum rate of primary vaccinations while adhering to strict ap - proved dosing schedules for those who have already received the first dose. Partial immunity is granted after the first vac- cine dose, as demonstrated in clinical trials.Organization In favor of extending dosing interval In favor of maintaining dosing as recommended by manufacturer Pfizer-BioNTech2 \"The safety and efficacy of the vaccine has not been evaluated on different dosing schedules as the majority of trial participants received the second dose within the window specified in the study design . . . There is no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days. \" British Society of Immunology 10\" ...delaying a second 'booster' dose of a protein antigen vaccine (such as the two approved COVID-19 vaccines [Pfizer-BioNTech and AZN]) by 8 weeks would be unlikely to have a negative effect on the overall immune response post-boost. \" US FDA 15 \"The second dose should be administered as close to the recommended interval as possible, \" i.e., 21 days and 28 days respectively. WHO 13 \" ...the interval between doses may be extended up to 42 days (6 weeks), on the basis of currently available clinical trial data. \" European Medicines Agency 9 \" ...the maximum interval of 42 days between the first and the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine should be respected to obtain full protection. \" US CDC 14\"There is no maximum interval between the first and second doses for either vaccine. Therefore, if the second dose is administered >3 weeks after the first Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine dose or >1 month after the first Moderna vaccine dose, there is no need to restart the series. \" Government of Canada 16 Pfizer-BioNTech minimum interval\u201419 days, authorized interval\u2014 21 days, alternate interval\u201428 daysModerna minimum interval\u201421 days, authorized interval\u201428 days, alternate interval\u2014none Government of Quebec 18\"Les experts ont devoil\u00e9 que la deuxi\u00e8me dose du vaccin et 90 jours apr\u00e8s la premi\u00e8re dose\"Experts have recommended that the second dose of the vaccine be administered between 42-90 days after the first dose. Government of Ontario 19Extend doses up to 42 days for some recipients of Pfizer-BioNtech. Long-term care residents, high-risk retirement home residents and their essential caregivers, and concurrently vaccinated staff: second dose of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine in 21 to 27 days. \u00b7 All other recipients of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine: second dose 21 - 42 days \u00b7 Moderna vaccine: 28 days Government of Alberta 20Second doses of COVID-19 vaccine will be offered within 42 days of the first dose Government of British Columbia 17Extend second dose to 35 days. \"A 35-day interval aligns with the operational reality that vaccine supplies will be back-end loaded with more vaccine scheduled to arrive in February and March 2021 than in December 2020 and January 2021 so everyone vaccinated will receive their second dose as scheduled in the coming weeks. \" Table. Dosing interval recommendations for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines from a variety of international and Canadian jurisdictions.Tauh T, Mozel M, Meyler P , Lee SM CliniC al70 BC MediC al Journal vol. 63 no. 2 | march 202170 CliniC al Immunity does not appear to wane for the duration studied (up to 42 days). There is no obvious biological basis to be- lieve that the long-term efficacy of the booster dose will be negatively affected by a short delay in receiving it. In an ideal world, there would be ample vac- cine and adequate logistical machinery to mass vaccinate the entire population using approved, clinical-trial tested dosing intervals. Unfortu- nately, jurisdictions around the globe are facing shortages that require us to face the inequi - ties of vaccine distribution, balance the ethical principles of beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice. While there are no large clinical trial published data to guide prolonged delays of the second dose, there are data to suggest that delaying the second dose likely preserves the long-term boost in immunity without an unac - ceptable decrease in immunity in the interven- ing period between doses. Therefore, delaying the second dose, which allows for wider primary vaccination (and therefore a faster route to im- munizing the most vulnerable members of our population), seems a reasonable option in situ- ations of vaccine shortage, such as what we are currently facing in BC, throughout Canada, and around the world. n Competing interests None declared.
