What it does eliminate is the need for post-exposure rabies immunoglobulin administration. It also decreases the number of post-exposure doses of vaccine needed. Rabies PrEP also may provide some protection if post-exposure rabies treatment is delayed or if rabies exposure goes unrecognized. Vaccination recommendations The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) develops recommendations on vaccine use for the prevention of disease\u2014including rabies\u2014in U.S. human populations. In May 2022, the ACIP redefined its categories for people at risk of rabies, and revised its [recommendations concerning rabies PrEP](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/pre-exposure_vaccinations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Frabies%2Fspecific_groups%2Fveterinarians%2Fstaff.html). Veterinarians, credentialed veterinary technicians, and veterinary assistants (including non-credentialed staff working as technicians) are now considered to be in risk category 3 of 5, and are recommended to get a primary PrEP series with two doses of rabies vaccine, seven days apart, to provide protection for up to three years. In addition, either of the following also is recommended: - A one-time rabies antibody titer check between one and three years after the primary two-dose series, then a booster if the titer is less than 0.5 IU/mL - A single booster between three weeks and three years after the first dose in the primary series was given Although not specifically mentioned by ACIP, the same recommendations could be presumed to apply to other members of the veterinary team who have contact with animals, as well as veterinary students. That's it. No additional boosters or titer checks are recommended, although the recommendations are more stringent for people at elevated risk for unrecognized rabies exposures (i.e., those in [risk categories 1 or 2](https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/prevention/pre-exposure_vaccinations.html#:~:text=These%20people%20should%20receive%20rabies,contact%20with%20the%20rabies%20virus.&text=A%202%2Ddose%20PrEP%20schedule,3%20years%20are%20also%20described)). Vaccination may be performed with either the human diploid cell vaccine or the purified chick embryo cell vaccine, by intramuscular administration in the deltoid area of the arm. Failure to complete the primary two-dose PrEP series puts you at risk of incomplete protection if exposed to rabies. Rabies vaccines can be ordered by a physician, or you can arrange vaccination through your local or state health department. Insurance coverage varies, so ask your provider whether your policy includes coverage, either full or partial. ( [AVMA LIFE's](https://avmalife.org/) basic protection packages do include rabies vaccination benefits.) "}
