Q:Could you explain the significance of the Surya Namaskar? The Surya Namaskar literally means salutation to the sun. Surya Namaskar is a beautiful set of asanas that massages, detoxifies and stimulates almost every organ of the human body, and brings suppleness to the spine. It can be done fast, as a cardiac toner, or slower to strengthen and tone the muscles, and enhance the functioning of internal organs. It can also be performed with the different Sanskrit (names of the Sun), to give a profound spiritual and meditative aspect.

A complete yoga sequence should comprise of complementary asanas, which help to balance the imbalances in the system. A healthy mix of standing, sitting, and lying down postures, is provided in the Sri Sri Yoga sequences.

In yoga one practises the asanas in a rhythmic manner that involves the body, mind, and spirit. Yoga is like an appointment with the Self, which rejuvenates one and rsquo;s entire system.

Q:What diet complements a daily yoga regime? The yogic diet is vegetarian and wholesome. The food we eat affects not just our body, but our mind also.

Yoga helps enhance the immune system, in addition to regulating the various organ systems of the human body. Improper digestion and unhealthy living, creates toxins in the system. Yoga helps to eliminate these toxins, leading to good health. In addition, regular practise of yoga balances the Tri-Gunas(Sattva, Rajas, Tamas - see 'Yoga and Food' section), having a profound effect on the body-mind complex. Q:Is practise of yoga asanas enough? Or does one need to study different scriptures on yoga - like Patanjali's Yoga sutras - to get a complete experience? The field of yoga is like an ocean.

Although yoga has its origins in Hinduism, yoga transcends any religion or culture. Its application is universal. Knowledge, which is scientific or spiritual, has universal application regardless of its origin. For example, the law of gravity was discovered in the West, but its application is universal. It would be childish of people in the East, to say that they will not use televisions and telephones, just because they were invented in the West. Similarly, it would be very narrow minded to say, that one will not use yoga because it comes from Hinduism - even though its benefits are well known. Q:What equipment do I need for home practise? For practising asanas, you do not require any special equipment - just you and your yoga mat.Actually the less equipment you use, the better it is, its more natural and effective. Q:Which is the best time for practising yoga? The best time to do yoga practise is early in the morning, when your stomach is empty, and you have a minimum number of distractions. It is also recommended that you repeat your practises late in the afternoon, or early evening before dinner. Morning practises keep your enthusiasm and energy levels higher during the day, and evening practises help you get rid of stresses and tensions accumulated during the day and ndash; refreshing you. Q:What are the benefits of regular yoga practise? Practising the yoga asanas daily: - Makes you more productive, calm, and happy - Enables you to deal effectively with the challenges and stresses of daily life Q:What should be the duration of a yoga practise session? Aim at doing your practises - for at least 1 hour every day in the beginning. If you do not have 1 hour every day, do your practises for whatever duration you can, however small it may be. Be regular and consistent in your practise. 20 minutes of daily practise is better than two hours of occasional practise. Q:Where can I plan to have a safe, comfortable practise? Do the yoga practises in a clean and well-ventilated space. If possible, keep a separate room for your yoga practises. You will build positive energy in that room, which will provide healing, strength, and comfort to you and others. Keep this room at comfortable warm temperature. The body stretches better in warm temperature. However, avoid having the temperature so excessively high, that the body feels uncomfortable, and the mind becomes restless - since this defeats the purpose of yoga. Practise away from any furniture, or any sharp objects. Q:How do I justify, the time I spend on myself to do yoga practise? A happy person spreads happiness all around.
