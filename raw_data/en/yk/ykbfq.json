It is made possible by a generous grant from the [Arthur Vining Davis Foundations](http://jvm.com/davis/). | | Author: | | 2.0 (upgrade to doc.com V4) 1.0 - 6/27/05 |Rationale| |A growing body of evidence shows that interpersonal communication skills strongly impact crucial health care outcomes. Training to competency in communication skills is increasingly required for clinicians at all levels of training.| The medical interview is the most common procedure that physicians will perform - numbering more that 150,000 scheduled interviews for a typical career, and additional countless telephone calls and unscheduled interviews with hospitalized patients and family members. In a busy practice, improving communication is often regarded as a luxury, and many clinicians believe that good communicators are \"born not made.\" In reality, communication skills must be learned, practiced, and maintained. ( [1-3](9_0.htm#1)) Key clinical outcomes related to communication skills include greater patient and clinician satisfaction, greater patient understanding and acceptance of treatment plans, reduced patient distress, and fewer lawsuits. ( [4-7](9_0.htm#4)) Interventions to improve clinician-patient communication can lead to improved biomedical outcomes such as better self-management of diabetes, reduced postoperative morbidity, and better coping and quality of life in cancer. ( [8-10](9_0.htm#8)) One way that communication skills affect outcomes is by determining the accuracy and completeness of the data available to generate hypotheses about the disease and the patient. ( [11](9_0.htm#11)) Communication also forms the basis for a therapeutic alliance, based on mutual trust, respect, and understanding of each other's ideas, feelings, and values. ( [12](9_0.htm#12)) The success of this alliance predicts patients' understanding of their conditions, adherence with treatment plans, and relief of pain and distress. The skills include identifying and removing barriers to communication (physical, psychological, social, cultural), surveying the patient's concerns and negotiating a consensual agenda for the visit. (doc.com module 7) The patient's uninterrupted opening statement will help you decide how actively you will need to guide the flow of information. Creating a shared agenda helps keep both of you \"on track\" during the encounter and rewards patients for taking an active role in their care. ( [14](9_0.htm#14)) Evidence shows that using these skills, and the skill of making explicit empathic and caring statements (doc.com module 6) saves time.( [2](9_0.htm#2), [14-16](9_0.htm#14)) Finding the right balance between patients' narrative and clinicians' diagnostic inquiry is a never-ending \"dance.\" Most interviews move back and forth between narrartive and inquiry to create a common language and understanding of the problem. ( [17,18](9_0.htm#17)) In addition to being immensely satisfying, the dance establishes trust and respect and promotes willingness to share the tasks of care. ( [19](9_0.htm#19)) It also makes the processes of giving information (doc.com module 10), negotiating a plan of care (doc.com module 11), enlisting the patient's active participation and planning follow-up more effective and efficient. The form and function of the dance are addressed more fully in the module on \"Structure and content of the interview.\" (doc.com module 5) |Questions Reflection:| | | |Key Principles:| | | |Learning goals:| | | At completion of this module, learners will be able to: |INTRODUCTION| | | doc.com meets the needs of trainees, clinicians, and accrediting and licensing bodies for education and proficiency in healthcare communications. The past few decades are marked by a growing attention to clinician interpersonal and communication skills. Physicians are re-discovering that their patient relationships are a major source of personal and professional satisfaction. Patients are asserting their desire for better communication with their clinicians. Researchers are establishing links between physician communication behaviors and vital health care outcomes. Some health care organizations are changing their policies and procedures in response to these changes. ( [20](9_0.htm#20)) At the same time, medical educators have noted that students' communication skills are eroded or \"unlearned\" during their training. ( [21](9_0.htm#21)) Most medical schools teach the basic skills, but many lack the resources, methods, or faculty training necessary for effective teaching in this domain. ( [22](9_0.htm#22)) In 1999, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) called for greater teaching of communication skills ( [23](9_0.htm#23)), and in 2003 the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) called for competency-based teaching and assessment, including \"interpersonal and communication skills\" as a core clinical competency required for successful completion of residency training. ( [24](9_0.htm#24)) The American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) adopted the same competencies for re-certification. |American Academy on Communication in Healthcare: doc.com| |The American Academy on Communication in Healthcare (AACH) is an organization of physicians and others interested in supporting and advancing education and research on communication, clinical relationships and related psychosocial skills.| The Academy's courses integrate lectures and readings with hands-on, small-group skills practice, peer observation and feedback, and opportunities to reflect, discuss, and integrate these experiences into our personal and professional lives. This doc.com program, developed by AACH with support from the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations and Drexel University College of Medicine, is designed to help learners and clinicians improve their communication skills. doc.com uses short didactic presentations and video demonstrations with commentary to illustrate important facts and skills. It also includes modules on self-awareness and self-care. Each module includes learning goals, key principles, questions for reflection, text and videos, and a behavior checklist. Learners can follow hyperlinks to references and resources. Web-based features enhance learners' experience, including the ability to chat live with others around the country using this resource, threaded discussion groups, and more. The modules are authored by some of experienced and respected medical educators, many of them AACH members. |COMMUNICATION SKILLS AND THE STRUCTURE OF doc.com| | | Skills are specific behaviors or tasks than can be reproduced at will. Clinical communication utilizes a set of skills defined from research, expert opinion, and consensus. Educators have organized the skills into conceptual models that aid recall, application, and assessment. Certifiers are also concerned with measuring skills and setting standards. This doc.com resource addresses five broad categories of communication skills, with 19 modules for learning the first 3 categories released in the summer, 2005, and the remaining modules in 2006 and 2007: emphasize critical role of self-awareness and self-care in effective communication.| | | Module 2 on \"Integrating Self-Reflection and Self-Awareness\" Click | | Module 3 on \"Therapeutic Aspects of Medical Encounters\" Click | | Module 4 on \"Balance and Self-Care\" Click | | Module 5 gives an overview of skills that are relevant to accomplish the 3 essential functions of every interview, Click Module 5 emphasizes that the flow of an interview may bear little resemblance to its final written structure. The authors note that integration of the so-called \"doctor-centered\" elements with the \"patient-centered\" elements of communication in the daily work of medical care is a challenge for all clinicians. The skills of self-awareness and self-care explored in the initial 5 modules promote our ability to listen, understand, explain, and \"be with\" others with minimal interference from our assumptions, expectations, and biases. ( [26](9_0.htm#26)). For example: |Essential Elements| |The Kalamazoo Consensus Statement defined the essential elements of medical communication| In 1999, teachers, researchers, and evaluators from medical schools and professional organizations attended an invitational conference on communication teaching, assessment, and evaluation. A major topic was delineating a set of teachable and learnable essential elements in physician-patient communication. The conference included architects and representatives of 5 current models of doctor-patient communication, so they reviewed these models, their evidence base, and their applications. Ultimately they identified 7 essential elements of [25](9_0.htm#25)) |1)|| | Build the relationship (module 6)Click |2)|| | Opening the discussion (module 7)Click |3)|| | Gathering information (module 8)Click |4)|| | Understanding the patient's perspective (module 9)Click |5)|| | Sharing information (module 10)Click |6)|| | Reaching agreement on problems and plans (module 11)Click |7)|| | Providing closure (module 12)Click Since its publication in 2001, the \"Essential Elements\" paper from this group has been widely used and cited. The concepts and ideas represent the collaboration and consensus of individuals from a variety of backgrounds in medical education. They also provide tangible examples of evidence-based skills that help teach and assess communication competency in a variety of clinical settings. |Advanced Elements| |The 7 Advanced Elements modules contain practical information and skills that build on related Essential Elements.| The Advanced Elements modules speak to common communication challenges that may require specific knowledge and the use of advanced adaptations of the Essential Elements skills in order to best serve patients. For example, this section includes modules on \"Non-Verbal Behavior\" (doc.com module 14) and \"Responding to Strong Emotions\" (module 13), an extension of the skills discussed in the \"Build a Relationship\" module of the Essential Elements (module 6). | | \"Non-Verbal Behavior\" (module 14)Click | | \"Responding to Strong Emotions\" (module 13)Click This section also contains modules on sexual (module 18), spiritual (module 19) and cultural issues (module 15) in communication that help us extend ourselves beyond the skills discussed in the Essential Elements modules of \"Gather Information\" (module 8) and \"Understand the Patient's (module 9) | | \"Asking about Sexuality\" (module 18)Click | | \"Exploring Spirituality and Religious Beliefs\" (module 19)Click | | \"Cultural Issues in the Interview\" (module 15)Click This section concludes with modules on \"Informed Decision Making\" (module 17) and \"Promoting Behavior Change and Adherence\" (module 16). | | \"Informed Decision Making\" (module 17)Click | | \"Promoting Behavior Change and Adherence\" (module 16)Click These modules present ideas and skills that increase our ability to address the complex everyday challenges of behavior change, enlarging on the skills outlined in the \"Share Information\" (module 10) and \"Reach Agreement\" (module 11) modules the Essential Elements. |Special Situations| |This section of doc.com contains 17 modules describing communication skills for specific situations. These skills are used in addition to, rather than instead of, the Essential and Advanced Elements skills.| The modules begin with a developmental approach (Family (module 20), Pediatric(module 21), Adolescent (module 22), and Geriatric Interviews (module 23) and proceed to changing specific behaviors (Smoking Cessation (module 24) and Diet/Exercise (module 25), managing psychiatric and psychosocial disorders (Anxiety/Panic Disorder (module 26), Depression (module 27), Domestic Violence (module 28), Alcoholism (module 29), Substance Abuse (module 29), and Somatization(see module 31)), and end of life care (Advance Directives (module 32), Giving Bad News (module 33), and Terminal Care (module 34). The section ends with modules on Discussing Medical Error (module 35) and Terminating the Doctor-Patient Relationship (module 36). |Communicating with Colleagues| |This section of doc.com contains 4 modules on communicating with other health care providers.| The modules include The Oral Presentation (see doc.com module 37), Communication within Health Care Teams (see module 38), Talking with Impaired Colleagues (see module 39), and Principles of Teaching Medical Students and Residents (see module 40). |COMMUNICATION SKILLS MATTER| | | Evidence for the impact of communication skills on crucial clinical outcomes continues to grow. The evidence that supports the urgency of consciously using skills discussed in doc.com is referenced in each module. The type and strength of the evidence varies with the specific skills and outcomes measured. Much of this evidence is based in three types of research: correlation (coded interview variables correlated with outcomes); observation (events or observations correlated with outcomes); and intervention (subjects receive an intervention and outcomes are measured). For example, patient satisfaction with a visit correlates with clinician information-giving. ( [27](9_0.htm#27)) Physicians with fewer malpractice suits were more likely to ask their patients' opinions and to check their understanding of the treatment plan. ( [7](9_0.htm#7)) Patients of physicians with 8 hours of training in emotion-handling skills reported reduction in emotional distress 6 months later. ( [2](9_0.htm#2)) The evidence linking communication skills to outcomes is summarized in a number of review articles and textbooks. ( [28-30](9_0.htm#28)) Patient outcomes found to correlate with good clinician communication skills (and representative references): 1) Greater satisfaction with the encounter ( [27]) 2) Improved psychological distress and coping ( [10]) 3) Improved physical symptoms ( [6]) 4) Greater recall and adherence ( [31]) 5) Positive health behavior change ( [33]) 6) Improved biologic markers (in some diseases) ( [8], [33]) 7) Reduced length of hospital stay ( [9]) Patient outcomes found to correlate with poorer clinician communication skills: 1) Greater disenrollment from More suits ( [35]) found to correlate with good clinician communication skills: 1) More information available for treatment planning ( [36]) 2) Fewer late arising concerns, such as \"Oh by the way\" items at end of visit ( [15]) 3) Greater satisfaction with the encounter ( [5]) 4) Greater comfort discussing sensitive issues ( [37]) |DEFICIENCIES IN CLINICIAN PERFORMANCE| | | Good communication doesn't just happen. Experience alone is a poor teacher, unless it is coupled with observation and coaching with feedback. Communication deficiencies abound in practice. The major ones are listed below, with relevant references: - We interrupt patients in the earliest phases of the encounter. ( [16], [38]) - We fail to identify and prioritize patient concerns. ( [16], [39]) - We miss opportunities to understand and acknowledge patients' ideas and feelings. ( [37], [41]) - We fail to understand the importance of culture and ethnicity in health care. ( [41]) - We do not give bad news concisely and compassionately. ( [42]) - We minimize patients' roles in their care. ( [43], [44]) - We underestimate patients' health literacy. ( [45]) - We don't negotiate differences well with patients. ( [46], [47]) - We fail to obtain adequate informed consent.( [48]) |CAN COMMUNICATION SKILLS BE TAUGHT AND LEARNED?| | | Yes, communication skills can be taught and learned with appropriate teaching methods, and maintained with periodic reinforcement. Maguire's landmark study of medical students demonstrated that communication skills training with video feedback led to stronger listening, clarification, and inquiry skills five years later. ( [49](9_0.htm#49)) More recently the Macy Initiative in Health Communications showed improvement in students' overall competence in communication, as well as skills in relationship-building, patient assessment, negotiation, and shared decision-making. ( [1](9_0.htm#1), [50](9_0.htm#50)) Postgraduate communication skills training is less well studied. ( [51-59](9_0.htm#51)) Continuing education programs in communication skills demonstrate an impact on clinician behavior. ( [2,3](9_0.htm#2), [60-62](9_0.htm#60)). The evidence that clinician communication training impacts behavior ( [63](9_0.htm#63)) and outcomes ( [64](9_0.htm#64)) was recently reviewed, and the evidence was used to develop comprehensive, consensus-based approach to teaching. ( [65](9_0.htm#65)) Two articles and a book chapter on assessing communication skills have also been published. ( [66-68](9_0.htm#66)) Many of the issues presented in doc.com are also discussed in a short, concise text, the Field Guide to the Difficult Patient Encounter, which has received positive reviews in medical journals. ( [69](9_0.htm#69)) Additional teaching and assessment tools can be found in the Outcomes Project area of the ACGME website at [www.acgme.org](../2_main/www.acgme.org). |Effective teaching methods| |Evidence demonstrates that specific teaching strategies improve communication skills.| Effective teaching methods include the following: A description or demonstration of skills is needed to give students a sense of what the skill should \"look like.\" Hands-on practice in small groups with observation, feedback, and repetition after feedback are important next steps. Feedback is more effective when coupled with videotape review or \"debriefing\" with the patient. With a little experience, learners can begin setting and pursuing individual learning goals based on their interests, feedback, or predetermined curricular goals. Reflection is best done in groups, where faculty can model and facilitate listening, explaining, and empathy skills. Reflection can be deepened with personal journaling. These activities promote learning skills of self-reflection and self-awareness. A variety of effective teaching methods exist (e.g., role play, video review, simulated patients) but none of these has consistently been shown to be superior to others. The proper timing, and \"dose-response\" properties of this teaching are unclear but involve several initial sessions followed by regular revisiting and deepening of skills. A number of excellent texts on communication skills are now available for a variety of audiences. |Becoming a Lifelong Learner| |Medical practice is changing rapidly, and the content and process of communication is changing with it.| Communication, like any medical procedure, requires constant revision and updating of skills. Information technology, electronic communication, collegial and interdisciplinary communication, patient safety/error disclosure, and defining the notion of professionalism and its relationship to communication are only a few of the areas on the communication skills horizon. Fundamental skills to communicate compassion and empathy have a timeless and cross-cultural application, and nevertheless must be fine-tuned to adjust to new developments in technology (organ transplants or HIV or chemotherapy treatments) and changing values in society (such as death with dignity, HIPPA regulations). Health care organizations, malpractice carriers, and professional societies already offer or endorse communication skills training for practicing clinicians. Professional societies publish articles on communication and the physician-patient relationship in their journals, and offer communication skills training during national meetings or special sessions. Finally, organizations such as American Academy on Physician and Patient, the Society for Teachers of Family Medicine, and others provide opportunities for regular enhancement of communication and interpersonal skills. The network of clinicians and educators committed to improving communication skills and the clinician-patient relationship, for themselves personally and for the medical profession is growing. |CONCLUSION| | | The evidence for the positive impact of excellent communication skills on key clinical outcomes continues to grow. However, improving the communications skills set is often discounted as an unaffordable extra (\"our priority must be to focus on learning more about diseases and how we can treat them\"), oversimplified as a personality trait (\"good bedside manner\") or dismissed as etiquette (\"being nice\"). Communication skills can be taught, learned and retained with appropriate educational methods. Educators emphasize that this is a challenging topic to teach and learn, because it requires us to examine our assumptions, feelings, and values regarding our selves, our patients, and our work. We believe you will learn much from the faculty who have contributed to doc.com, and will discover new freedom of expression, levels of meaning, satisfaction and enjoyment in your clinical work as you master the many skills of clinician-patient communication. Best of luck! |LITERATURE REFERENCES| Dennis H.

Mindfulness can also be applied to the acquisition of skills and knowledge, cultivation of caring and healing attitudes, and facing the anxiety of uncertainty. In this introduction section, you will find the following: Jelalludin Rumi (1207-1273) ( [1](9_0.htm#1)) The Guest House This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meannness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still, treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the same, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond. |Self-awareness is a key to effective medical practice| | | Mindfulness means focusing your attention on your own thoughts and feelings in the moment. Self-awareness is knowing your gifts, areas for improvement, assumptions, prejudices and biases; toward people generally, toward patients, toward cognition, emotions, spirit and intuition in general, and toward these elements as they affect your professional work. Self-awareness is a key to effective medical practice.( [2](9_0.htm#2)) Just as pianists must be attentive and aware of each small hand movement to ensure accuracy and efficiency, effective clinicians must self-monitor the affect, tone of voice, choice of words, timing and emotional reactivity that they bring to each encounter. To avoid errors in diagnosis, we as clinicians must be aware of our own biases and tendencies towards premature closure. Also, in order to be fully present for patients, clinicians should work towards emotional health and balance in their lives. We believe that self awareness, personal growth and well being should be specifically addressed in medical training. We have appended specific goals and objectives for this learning, as well as useful questions for reflection, that can lead to greater self awareness in relation to your patient care (see [Appendix 1](7_00.htm) and [Appendix 2](8_00.htm)). While the importance of self-awareness may seem obvious, achieving self-awareness is not straightforward. This chapter is about training for mindfulness the qualities of attentive observation, critical curiosity, beginner's mind and presence that make possible the use of self-awareness to influence clinical practice( [3,4](9_0.htm#3)) |Clinicians are vulnerable to errors in communication due to lack of self-awareness| | | Complex communications with patients and colleagues require more deliberation than routine clinical acts. Will Miller characterized clinical practice as consisting of routines, dramas and ceremonies.( [5](9_0.htm#5)) Routine clinical acts require little thought or psychological investment, dramatic situations require action in the moment, and ceremonies are ritualized and symbolic acts that require presence. Similarly, medical decisions are often made on the basis of pattern-recognition, on the evocation of complex remembered patterns of disease, and less commonly, through conscious deliberation. Some have argued for conscious deliberation of all medical decisions, but this is hardly practical. Unfortunately, automaticity brings the risk of unconscious incorporation of assumptions that may not be true, and emotional reactivity may override good judgment.( [6](9_0.htm#6)) Communication with an individual patient at a specific moment about a particular problem may appear routine or ceremonial, but requires us to be self-aware and attentive to unexpected twists, concerns or new information. |The role of the unexpected in challenging clinicians to be more self-aware| | | Unanticipated events pack the work days of medical professionals. In contrast to technicians, professionals not only follow protocols, but more importantly, learn how to individualize care, deal with unfamiliar and unanticipated situations, and make decisions with inadequate data, time or support. The \"uninvited guests\" described in Rumi's poem are familiar to most of us: situations that involve ambiguity and uncertainty, situations in which there are conflicts between the needs of patients and clinicians, and situations characterized by strong emotions -- the patient's and our own. Technical errors, contradictory evidence and recommendations, and unanticipated complications challenge us on a daily basis. Recognition that our own knowledge is impermanent, that our sense of competence is fragile, and that control over a situation is illusory can be unsettling to even very experienced clinicians. |MINDFULNESS, MINDLESSNESS AND DELUSION| | | Mindfulness is \"paying attention, on purpose, to one's own mental and physical processes during everyday tasks, so as to act with clarity and insight.\" Delusion is the tendency of the mind to seek premature closure and to confuse our view of things with the way things are. In response to difficult communications with patients and their families, clinicians respond with varying degrees of mindfulness and delusion. Mindfulness is a state of being that permits insight. Insight, in turn, makes correct action and compassion possible. Mindfulness \"leads the mind back from theories, attitudes and abstractions to the experience itself.\" Mindfulness is the study of subjective experience from the inside out. This subjective experience can include emotions, communication, ethical dilemmas, and procedural techniques. Mindfulness refers to a state of mind during everyday work, rather than analysis of our actions after the fact. The absence of mindfulness is mindlessness and delusion. Mindless forgetting, insensitivity or haste can result from fatigue, emotional overload or overwork, and might be thought of as a manifestation of distractibility. Delusion, on the other hand, is a more clinically insidious phenomenon. It is \"the tendency of the mind to seek premature closure...that quality of mind that imposes a definition on things and then mistakes the definition for the actual experience\"( [7](9_0.htm#7)). A common example of delusion would be looking at a prior diagnosis rather than the patient's current situation in order to make a clinical decision in communication and in diagnostic thinking, the patient is not \"allowed\" to have experienced change. Another example would be the inability to adopt a new perspective and rethink an initial impression of another person. |A case example of the lack of mindfulness causing an unfavorable outcome| A tired resident admitted a 50-year old man recently diagnosed with bladder cancer. In the emergency room, the patient was noted to have scanty urination, and was assumed to have been dehydrated. When IV fluids failed to increase the patient's urinary output, the IV rate was increased. Because the diagnosis seemed so straightforward, the resident did not think to check the patient's status. Several hours later, the patient, now in severe pain, was assumed by the nurse to be over-reacting. The following morning, another resident elicited a history of recent catheterization for urinary obstruction after bladder surgery. At that point, the possibility of urinary outflow obstruction entered the minds of those caring for him. His pain was now considered justifiable and the patient was offered analgesia and insertion of a Foley catheter. After two liters of urine drained, the patient experienced relief of his pain. Lack of mindfulness is common, although not necessarily as dramatic as the previous example. Poor information gathering can be the result of a mind closed by paying more attention to a presumed diagnosis to the clinical state of the patient. Low-level decision rules ( [6](9_0.htm#6)) can result in premature closure. In contrast, the misdiagnosis could have been questioned earlier by adopting an attitude of attentiveness, curiosity, openness and doubt. As in this situation, mindlessness and delusion lead to poor judgment by assuming things about patients that may not be true, or not acknowledging the limits of your information or knowledge. One of the most difficult qualities to teach and assess is presence the sense of \"being there\", undistracted and in tune with the patient and his or her needs. These can all be affected by situational factors such as fatigue; each of us has a threshold beyond which judgment begins to suffer. We can learn techniques, such as those described below, for recognizing when our own cognitive and emotional processing are not optimal, and making appropriate adjustments to avoid miscommunications and errors. |Cognitive psychology of mindfulness and communication| | | Competent practitioners use both \"tacit\" knowledge and \"explicit\" knowledge. Tacit knowledge is hard to express, and derives from experience. Communication behaviors develop from a lifetime's experience, but that experience is seldom carefully examined, and frequently produces \"delusions.\" The idea of mindfulness is based in cognitive psychology, which describes two types of knowledge necessary to be clinically competent -- tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge. Tacit knowledge is what one knows but finds difficult to express. An example is how to ride a bicycle, or in medical contexts, how to recognize that a person is sick. Some educators and philosophers suggest that tacit knowledge is the core of professional competence. Explicit knowledge is what can be easily explained, perhaps the differential diagnosis of a cough in a 70-year old smoker. Communication skills are usually tacit; that is, clinicians rarely think in the moment, \"I have just used an open-ended question.\" Tacit knowledge depends on experience, but experience does not necessarily build competence. Repeated mistakes may constitute experience, and lead to unexamined errors in tacit knowledge, which we call \"delusion\". Tacit assumptions may be unveiled as delusions and come to explicit awareness when a patient responds in an unexpected manner. For example, a student said, \"I understand\" in an attempt to be empathic, and was taken aback when the patient replied, \"You couldn't possibly understand unless you had what I have\". Delusion can take other forms as well. For example, when asked about their communication behaviors, physicians commonly believe they \"regularly employ\" certain skills, but when interviews are directly observed, their use of these skills is frequently not confirmed. We may believe that we give patients choices and solicit patients' questions but observation shows otherwise. One way to counter such assumptions is to video-record consultations and review them later. Another way is to cultivate the ability to recall exactly what was said rather than sustaining a delusion of what \"must have\" taken place. Finally, medical practice frequently involves multi-tasking and even though it seems efficient, decreased attentiveness to the individual tasks often results in ignoring what would otherwise be obvious. |Mindfulness and clinical errors| | | Becoming more mindful of how fatigue, emotional factors and avoidance affect communication may eliminate important mistakes. At 3am a physician working the night shift in the emergency department encounters an adolescent female patient who complains of lower abdominal pain. She initially denies that anything happened that might have caused the pain. The physician is trained in taking a sexual history, knows about the epidemiology of sexual and physical abuse, and has cared for victims of rape. At 3pm, encountering the same patient, this clinician would have inquired further were any drugs or alcohol taken? Are you sure no one has tried to hurt you? You seem nervous could you tell me if that is true? Would you prefer to talk with a female doctor? But, at 3am, those questions were not asked. The clinician reassures herself and the patient that this is a case of gastroenteritis or irritable bowel, and misses an important opportunity to identify sexual abuse and prevent future episodes. The \"lesion\" in this interaction was not lack of knowledge or experience on the part of the physician. Rather, it was a context-driven tendency toward premature closure perhaps due to fatigue, perhaps because the clinician imagined the increased emotional energy, forms to be filled out and telephone calls required should a history of sexual abuse or rape be elicited.( [6](9_0.htm#6)) The \"cognitive alibi\" that the patient has symptoms of a gastrointestinal disorder seemed sufficient to justify not inquiring further. Now, imagine what would have happened if the physician had been more mindful if she had ability to recognize her tendency towards ignoring certain aspects of the patient's history when tired, her inability to question her own thinking, her need to distance herself emotionally and her hasty decision-making. Perhaps a more mindful response to a complex situation would have resulted in a better outcome. |HABITS OF MINDFUL PRACTITIONERS| | | Fundamental qualities of mindful practitioners are attentive observation, critical curiosity, beginner's mind and presence. The goal of mindfulness and its four components is to promote effective communication, wise decisions, and caring attitudes. Mindfulness includes awareness of the body, thoughts, emotions and sensations, and attention to our own level of mental alertness and restlessness. This section is about: |Attentive observation| | | Attentive observation refers to the capacity to observe our own behavior while simultaneously being attentive to the patient \"observing the observer while observing the observed\". Attentiveness involves both focus on the task at hand and also the capacity to see or hear things that are not in your direct focus, nor what you might be expecting to see or hear. By welcoming the unexpected, the attentive practitioner is able to examine data that might otherwise have been ignored. Attentiveness can be encouraged by example, trained using videotape review, and promoted by reflective questioning. One can also be attentive to one's own state of mind. Recognizing that judgment may be impaired by fatigue or strong emotions (that may have nothing directly to do with the patient) is the first step in avoiding errors due to misperceptions or unclear thinking. |Critical curiosity| | | Critical curiosity characterizes a mindful clinician's response to the unexpected. Listening for the unexpected involves the ability to find surprise in the ordinary actions of daily work, and to listen to yourself and others without naming what is heard until it has been understood. In practice critical curiosity translates into avoiding premature closure. Rather than ignoring disconfirming or upsetting data, mindful clinicians engage in a disciplined further questioning or listening to the patient, and questioning their own judgment. Critically curious clinicians tolerate and learn from errors. Critical curiosity is not the seemingly undisciplined curiosity of a young child, and retains the capacity for filtering and judgment. Mindful clinicians are constantly vigilant for disconfirming evidence, and hesitate to assume that all relevant data have been elicited and processed. |\"Beginner's mind\"| | | The goal of medical education is to acquire expertise, but expertise has its dangers. As clinicians develop a taxonomy of illness and suffering, and categories of experience-based treatment protocols, they can lose the perspective that a newcomer might bring, an important element of mindfulness. The educator John Dewey called this perspective \"cultivated naivet\u00e9\" or the capacity to adopt a \"beginner's mind\". In the case of the patient with urinary obstruction, those caring for the patient were not able to disentangle their image of the patient from the patient's actual experience. By placing the patient in a category (\"dehydrated patient\"), they were unable to ask about, perceive or respond to symptoms that were obvious clues. |\"Presence\"| | | Clinicians with presence are those who have the ability to lower reactivity and not be distracted by anxiety, in order to focus on the task and the patient rather than their own assumptions, needs and formulations. Presence includes patience, personal involvement and caring. Presence is required for the expression of compassion, because without it, attempts to be compassionate may be misdirected and inadequately address the patient's needs. |BECOMING MINDFUL| | | You can become mindful, if you learn the characteristic behaviors of mindfulness and attend to developing and maintaining these skills and qualities in your work.( The qualities are listed below and examined in detail in the following paragraphs: |Priming| | | \"Priming\" means that clinicians have developed the expectation that they will be able to report their own mental processes. For example, a primed student and resident can report not only their clinical findings, but also their own thoughts and feelings during the visit. They can observe what they do to prepare themselves for each encounter. Do they stop for a moment? Do they complete the previous patient's chart? Do they develop a mental list of tasks? Do they take a deep breath? An early reflective question (\"How might your prior clinical experience affect your decision-making in this case?\") might help set the stage for mindful inquiry. Other priming activities take place outside of the clinical setting. Reading poetry, for example, can invite an intense focus on the present moment. ( [9](9_0.htm#9)) |Being available| | | Being available means developing an openness to experience, to learn to expect the unexpected, avoiding judging experiences as \"good\" or \"bad\". Being available means quiet moments within the chaotic health care and clinical educational environments. Training programs can use formats such as \"reflection groups\" to discuss clinical situations that raised difficulties for participants,( [10](9_0.htm#10), [11](9_0.htm#11)) \"Balint groups\" that explore strong emotional reactions that affect clinical care,( [12](9_0.htm#12)) and \"family of origin groups\" that explore trainees' experience of their families' values and their cultural norms in order to understand their positive and negative reactions to patients.( [13](9_0.htm#13), [14](9_0.htm#14)) Other formats that help the learner focus on the present include videotape reviews that remind practitioners of their emotions and biases, and provides space to examine them. Keeping a journal, meditation, and exercise are individual means to this end. However valuable these educational experiences are in themselves, their value is in preparing the learner to be present and available in real clinical situations. Clinical preceptors can model the presence and attentive availability that facilitates patient encounters. |Reflective questions| | | Reflective questions are designed to help clinicians doubt their initial impressions, disrupt habitual patterns of thought and behavior, see a familiar situation in a new way and discover the uniqueness of each situation. Reflective questions are designed not to edify, but rather to invite doubt and ambiguity. Asking reflective questions helps clinicians to identify opportunities for learning, seize them, and discover their own answers. For example, data gathering is commonly conditioned by the expected diagnosis. A resident might expect that a fatigued patient has a viral syndrome, and \"forget\" to ask about sleep, moods or feelings that might suggest that the fatigue derives from depression. Asking yourself, \"What am I assuming about this patient that might not be true?\" can provoke curiosity in an open-ended way, and improve diagnostic thinking. The answer may not be as important as the process of inquiry - in fact, many reflective questions have no answers. Faculty members can help students internalize a habit of self-questioning that will improve the trainee's ability to listen and observe. Teachers should ask, \"What did you observe?\" \"In what ways were you surprised?\", \"How did you respond to the feeling of surprise\", \"What interfered with your observations?\" and also, \"If there were relevant data that you ignored, what might they be?\" The teaching of clinical ethics benefits from using reflective questions. A preceptor can comment on \"tacit ethics of the moment\" as reflected in small gestures that often go unnoticed in daily practice. They can ask learners to note those small moral acts, such as how nods of the head convey interest or not, or how the clinician acknowledges an error to a patient | | Table of reflective questions |Active engagement| | | Professional education should include frequent sustained contact between teacher and learner, observing the learners' active engagement in thinking, skill development and personal awareness. Medical education is too often structured as if the most difficult matters are learned without critique or mentoring. In his essay, \"What if they taught musicians the way that medical students are trained?\" Engel ( [15](9_0.htm#15)) describes an imaginary scenario in which music students would never be observed actually playing their instruments, and would report what they had done. We can laugh at this absurdity, but need to examine closely what we do in medical education. The making of musicians requires that technique be made sufficiently automatic so that they do not have to think about every muscle movement, but can maintain enough subsidiary awareness to recognize when technique needs more focused attention. Similarly, they bring awareness to the harmonic structure at key transitional moments, but let it inform the interpretation in a more tacit way at other times. Competent clinicians know how to actively engage with patients while balancing personal awareness, skill use and cognitive reasoning, just as musicians have the awareness, technique and knowledge to be musically expressive and to simultaneously listen from the perspective of the audience. |Role modeling and thinking out loud| | | Faculty members who model \"thinking out loud\" thus emphasize that professional medical practice requires the constant effort of recognizing and correcting for errors, rather than a linear pursuit of protocol. Thinking out loud can help convert tacit knowledge to explicit, and reveal paradoxes and inconsistencies between intended and real effects of our actions. This can occur while teaching about communication, clinical reasoning or even technical skills. For example, surgical training now includes virtual reality training to help residents \"think out loud\" while performing simulated procedures that involve fine manipulations of laparoscopic instruments. A similar process can provide in-the-moment feedback on communication behaviors using videotape or live observation. |Practice| | | \"Practice\" is disciplined repetition in controlled settings. \"Practiced behaviors\" become skills that require less effort to use daily. Among performing artists, a common saying is, \"in discipline is freedom.\" Practice requires an object, real or imagined, external or internal. The object of meditation is one's own thought process, of music it is sound and the audience, and of medicine it is the patient and the learner. Availability, active engagement, listening deeply (especially to those things that we'd rather not hear), generosity and \"beginner's mind\" can be practiced. \"Unexpecting\" is an aspect of practice that refers to training ourselves to recognize our expectations, and then imagine another outcome. Curiosity can be practiced. For example, try spending 15 minutes simply recording in writing the names of all red things that you see. Even such a simple exercise can bring awareness to one's tendency to become excited, bored, curious or annoyed when presented with a routine task. Participants usually report suddenly categorizing the world into red things, which are of interest, and non-red things, which are ignored. Then they wonder about those categories asking, \"How red does something have to be to be considered 'red'?\" A parallel situation would be for clinicians to question the categories to which the symptoms are assigned. Practicing presence involves developing habits of reflection, such as including in each day opportunities for complete silence and stillness. Stillness can be found during work-related tasks. It is a tool that performing musicians use - an inner stillness in order to project energy to the audience. Precious moments of repose occur even during a busy day-- the small moments of inaction between actions. The visceral learning from practicing stillness allows clinicians to experience that stillness when they need to call upon it (making the knowledge explicit) - to clear the mind before seeing the next patient, to perform a delicate procedure, or to listen more deeply to a disturbing story. Stillness apart from professional life might include doing meditation, observing nature or listening to music. This is not a \"new age\" or mystical process it is a quality of mind that has been consciously cultivated by master clinicians, concert pianists and tennis champions. (16) |Self-monitoring| | | Self-monitoring refers to being aware of any disparity between intention and action, and between the imagined effect and the effect produced. Self-monitoring refers to the moment-to-moment awareness of one's intentions (e.g., to find out what's wrong) and one's actions (e.g. facilitating or cutting off conversations). Self-monitoring involves observing the observer at the same time you are observing the observed. Part of why this is difficult to do is that we judge ourselves harshly, and do not like to see that our actions sometimes diverge from our intentions. When we misunderstand a patient, make an error or suffer from ignorance, we feel badly. And, we tend to avoid in the future the types of situations that produced discomfort in us in the past. A skilled clinician anticipates the effect of a gesture or statement to a patient and carefully tracks the effect of that attempted communication and if there is some evidence that communication has been inadequate in some way, makes corrections to achieve mutual understanding. ( [17](9_0.htm#17)) |Assessment and confirmation| | | We suggest that mindfulness be one criterion for assessment of trainees. Patients may be able to assess \"presence,\" and undistracted attention. Tolerance of uncertainty can be assessed through direct observation and debriefing. Evidence of curiosity is manifest in the use of reflective questions and \"thinking out loud.\" You can set your personal expectations by saying, \"Not only will I be looking at how I solve the clinical problems and how I relate to patients, but also I will be assessing how I reflect on my own performance.\" Peer ratings and self-ratings can be helpful. We can all learn to identify things that we have learned about medicine, or ourselves, in the course of caring for patients. |HEALTH SYSTEMS CAN EMBODY THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF MINDFULNESS AS INDIVIDUALS| | | A mindful approach to systems problems has some of the same characteristics as mindfulness in individual practitioners.( A young man underwent a lymph node dissection for testicular cancer. After dissecting the left kidney, the surgeon turned his attention to the right kidney, and was no longer able to see the left one. A medical student in the OR noted that the left kidney began to turn a dusky blue color. Alarmed, he mentioned this to the attending surgeon, who denied that there was a problem and chastised the medical student for interrupting the operation. A few minutes later the kidney had turned a dusky violet color. The student spoke to the nurse, who relayed the information to a resident, and then to the surgeon. The surgeon attempted to restore blood flow, and ultimately called in a vascular surgeon to perform a delicate procedure to repair a tear in the arterial lining. The patient's kidney function was abnormal following the surgery; the patient and family were told that there was an unexpected and unavoidable complication of surgery. Researchers of medical errors have focused on the structure of health care teams to find root causes of these errors. Chaotic process and faulty communication among professionals in the operating room led to an avoidable error, and organ damage worsened. The hierarchical team structure and an atmosphere of blame and retribution prevented early corrective action. In this case, the lack of mindfulness had ethical ramifications as well. The \"cover-up\" after the event was partially determined by the malpractice climate and advice from risk management personnel never to admit an error to a patient. Mindful systems should be vigilant, and assume that systems tend to fail in unpredictable ways. For difficult problems, a tolerance for complexity and ambiguity will favor accurate observation and creative solutions, rather than oversimplification and premature closure. Critical curiosity thinking \"outside the box\" is characteristic of high-functioning individuals and systems. Brainstorming is one way of fostering curiosity, but only works if the ground rules include consideration of options that initially seem unorthodox. Administrators of large systems can easily lose track of the realities on the shop floor, and open, non-punitive communication can facilitate transparency of intent rather than hiding of errors. Systems can be set up that promote flexibility rather than reinforcing a single rigid process for dealing with problems. Flexibility, in turn, leads to greater suppleness and resilience. Finally, mindful systems include mechanisms to recognize that expertise and hierarchy may not be synonymous; the janitor may have a more accurate perspective on local infection control than the chief of the infectious disease service. |SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION| | | Mindfulness, a quality of clinicians and health systems, is fundamentally a set of habits of mind and habits of practice in the moment. These habits can be taught and learned, and professionals and systems who have these habits deliver very high quality medical care. Mindful practice is an approach to self-knowledge and a component of professionalism, in the service of improved patient outcomes. These outcomes include patient health status, prevention of medical errors, patient trust and adherence to treatment, clinician growth and satisfaction, and lower health care costs. Mindfulness may be facilitated by exercises and forums outside the context of daily work but includes more than retrospective analysis of clinical actions. Many principles of mindful practice can be observed in master clinicians, even though they may not name it as such. Methods for fostering mindfulness in clinical practice can be successfully incorporated into educational programs. |APPENDIX 1: PERSONAL AWARENESS IN MEDICINE: QUESTIONS FOR PERSONAL REFLECTION| What are my core beliefs about myself as a physician?

For thousands of years, before the modern era of efficacious drugs and other medical interventions, sick people have sought care from physicians. Many of these patients experienced relief and started on the road to healing. How did this happen? If we can identify the therapeutic elements of clinical encounters, we can be intentional about maximizing these elements with patients. There are several core concepts that help us understand the therapeutic efficacy of physician-patient encounters: the biopsychosocial model, the importance of meaning, physicians' healing attitudes, and the healing power of caring in physician-patient relationships. In the introduction section of this module you'll find the following: |The Biopsychosocial Model| | | The Biopsychosocial Model, first articulated by George Engel, ( The field of psychosomatic medicine has produced copious scientific evidence confirming the biopsychosocial model. ( [2](9_0.htm#2)) As examples, stress, depression and social isolation are associated with physiologic and anatomical changes that promote disease. Unhealthy behaviors such as smoking and drug abuse also promote the pathophysiology of diseases. The biopsychosocial model assumes the essential unity of mind, body and spirit. One way to understand this unity is to realize that thought, feelings, and abstract reasoning are also neurobiological processes. While you are reading this, neurochemical processes are being stimulated in your brain. Basic changes in m-RNA and neurotransmitter metabolism are occurring as new information is being processed. If your feelings are aroused, neuroendocrine mechanisms are affecting other bodily processes. All of which, in turn, can affect your behaviors, as well as basic physiologic processes that modulate immunity and innumerable body functions. Thus, in thinking scientifically about illness and disease, you must consider the biological, psychological, behavioral, and social factors that contribute to your patient's illness. You can learn to use your understanding of biopsychosocial interactions to counsel your patients so they can change their reactions to stress, recover from depression, reengage with their loved ones and community, and change maladaptive behaviors. |The Impact of meaning in medical care| | | All humans create meaning, all the time. The meanings that patients ascribe to symptoms affect their illness outcomes and ability to function well. The meanings we ascribe to our patients' illnesses and behaviors affect our interactions with them. ( The way people experience illness is a function of both their somatic alterations (i.e. changes in their anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, etc.) as well as a host of psychological, social, and behavioral factors. The experience of illness depends on what patients say to themselves. Illness is associated with symptoms which trigger a series of thoughts, beliefs and concerns as well as emotional and behavioral responses. For example, in predisposed individuals stress may precipitate contraction or spasm of temporal or cervical muscles, causing a headache. Some will think of this headache as a minor nuisance that will eventually go away on its own, while others may become concerned that it signifies a serious underlying problem like a brain tumor. These concerns can lead to feelings of anxiety as well as maladaptive behaviors, such as more vigilant monitoring of symptoms and decreased activity or social isolation. This sets up a vicious cycle that is likely to worsen symptoms and dysfunction. Many factors influence how people ascribe meaning to a symptom. Some people view their symptoms in a pessimistic manner (e.g. it will never get better) while others think about the same health problem more optimistically. People vary in their perceptions about their ability to control health problems. People with a high level of self-efficacy take remedial steps on their own, while those with lower self-efficacy rely on others, such as mothers, physicians and alternative healers. Attributions about causes of health problems vary as well, and some people blame themselves for the cause of problems. Some believe the cause will never change, while others see the cause as a temporary phenomenon. Some people feel their illness affects everything about them (e.g. if I have diabetes I must be a sick person) while others think of health problems as but one aspect of who they are (e.g. I am an energetic, vital person who happens to have diabetes). The reactions of family, friends and physicians can reinforce the sick role and further increase patients' concerns, and ultimately both the severity of symptoms and the level of dysfunction. Stressful events or social isolation may deplete the person's ability to adequately cope with new health problems. In our role as caregivers, we also attribute meaning to symptoms and patients' behaviors, and need to be aware of our attributions so that we can provide the objective and unbiased care. (See module 2) Additionally, physicians can respond helpfully to meanings patients ascribe to sickness, reassure them, educate them, reframe their situations so that they see new meanings in their illnesses, and guide them to adopt healthy behaviors. |Holding and communicating healing attitudes| | | Physicians are themselves \"therapeutic instruments.\" Your words and behaviors communicate your attitudes and are powerful change agents. To become maximally effective, you must \"calibrate your instrument.\" ( You must ask yourself if you are fully committed to your patients' healing and well-being, and whether you have the ability to express a sense of caring in words, nonverbally and in deeds. If you feel hope, optimism and caring toward your patients, your activities have a high likelihood of being helpful. If you feel annoyed with patients, or feel judgmental about their inability or unwillingness to change unhealthy behaviors, your words and manner inevitably communicate those feelings and undermine your therapeutic efforts. If you are not able to communicate empathy and interest in the patient as a person in a particular situation, your good intentions are much less apparent to patients. Your patience, tolerance and generally positive outlook will be frequently tested. For example, you may need to make patients unhappy or angry, such as when communicating unpleasant news, or telling them crucial information, (e.g., \"I think your diagnosis is alcohol dependence,\" or, \"Your bone scan shows that your cancer has spread.\") If you focus more on your fear of hurting patients' feelings in the moment than on caring for them over hours, days or years, you will temper your message and be less effective. If you find yourself less than fully committed or lacking certain abilities, you may need to \"recalibrate your instrument,\" that is, strive to understand your values, attitudes and biases as they become barriers to your care and to learn skills to communicate your caring in a broad range of challenging situations. |The healing power of physicians' caring| | | Perhaps the most fundamental of all healing attitudes is your caring for each patient. Peabody observed, in a famous address to Harvard medical students in 1925, ( [5](9_0.htm#5)) that \" the secret of the care of the patient is in caring for the patient.\" When patients are ill, they are often hurt, apprehensive and confused. Independent, self-sufficient people will lose confidence, become dependent and may regress in their relationships with others and with their physicians. They yearn to be taken care of, to experience the comfort and caring of a loving parent. Patients will often \"project\" that need and see their physicians in a parental role. Though you may be a medical student, resident or young attending, even elderly patients will often unconsciously see you in that way. To the extent that you can express your caring, your support, your understanding, your willingness to be with the patient whatever comes or whatever they say, you will be providing comfort, safety, reassurance and healing. Expressing your caring can assist you to listen and become present with another person. Many physicians in practice have the experience of patients staying alive, or not giving up, because they have clearly expressed their caring to the patient in words and deeds. Many have experienced their patients' appreciation in return, which reinforces the \"caring\" attitude, nourishes the healthy human cycle of people caring for each other, and enriches physicians' lives and work. |THERAPEUTIC GOALS OF THE MEDICAL ENCOUNTER| | | The specific therapeutic goals of the medical encounter are to: In so doing, physicians will derive certain benefits as well, these benefits include: The process of accomplishing these goals involves six tasks. Physicians need to: 1) understand their patients and their health problems, 2) demonstrate interest and concern, 3) inform and involve the patient in their care, 4) provide counseling, 5) create trust and confidence, and 6) demonstrate support and respect. There are a set of strategies physicians can use to accomplish each of these tasks. These strategies may be designed to change the way a patient thinks about their problems (i.e. cognitive strategies), the emotional distress that has contributed to or resulted from their health problems (i.e. affective strategies) and the maladaptive behaviors associated with the problem, (i.e. behavioral strategies). In the remainder of this module, we will review each of these therapeutic tasks and discuss how they can be accomplished during the medical encounter. These tasks are well covered in the modules to follow, but we will highlight some of the essentials. |Understanding Patients and their Health Problems| | | This is a major task in the therapeutic process. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of the factors contributing to the onset and maintenance of a patient's illness guides therapeutic interventions. How are patients' stressful life situations, emotional states, personalities, past histories of trauma or abuse, financial worries, etc. contributing to the illness? By the end of your interview with patients, you should have a good understanding of the biological, psychological, behavioral and social factors that contribute to the onset and maintenance of their illnesses. Patients seldom hesitate to express somatic symptoms, but are typically more guarded both in disclosing emotional symptoms or stressful life problems, and unveiling pertinent details. These problems in patients' lives are common however, frequently not recognized, and they can cause or contribute to the patient's health problems. It is also important to understand patients' beliefs and concerns, goals and expectations for the management of their health problems. These issues will usually not be discussed unless you directly ask. Evaluating these issues can facilitate more effective and more satisfactory management decisions. For example, a patient who presents with a headache may have one or more of the following five goals in mind for the visit: 1) obtain something from the physician to relieve the symptom, 2) learn how to prevent headaches from recurring, 3) reassurance about the cause of the headache, 4) receive help for the stress that is causing the headache, 5) obtain administrative help like a note for work. Each of these goals will require a different set of management strategies. Failure to recognize a patient's goal(s), concerns, and expectations often provide in ineffective and unsatisfactory care. Understanding these aspects of the patient's problems requires that you begin by asking open ended questions and give patients sufficient time to fully respond. Skills that facilitate a comprehensive response to an open question like, \"How have you been doing since your last visit?\" are discussed in module 8. Usually, you have to ask directly about patients' beliefs (e.g. \"What have you thought might be causing your problems?\"), concerns (e.g. \"What concerns do you have about this problem?\"), goals (e.g. \"In what ways do you hope to benefit from addressing this problem today?\"), and expectations (e.g. \"What types of things do you feel we might do to help you with this problem?\") ( [6](9_0.htm#6)) Module 9 discusses \"understanding the patient's perspective\" in greater depth. It is helpful to cultivate the skills of attending to patients' cues and clues, and following up with nonjudgmental and respectful further inquiry. For example, very often people mention \"stress,\" or say at an odd point, \"My uncle (neighbor, friend, etc) had liver cancer,\" without further elaboration. They are not sure you will be interested, or worried that you will think their concern unimportant. If you miss the cue, they may feel ignored, and trust in the relationship will be a little (or a lot, depending on details) eroded. Asking how the stress has been affecting them, both physically and emotionally, and whether or not it impacts their normal activities; or why they brought up the uncle just now may reveal information that enables you to minimize tests and consultations, and save time, and foster the healing relationship. |Psychiatric illness| | | Dissociation from feelings, treating people as objects and feeling ineffective are the usual symptoms of burnout. Importantly, the responses to clues sometimes help point toward the need for a diagnostic assessment for a mood or anxiety disorder. Other clues that suggest that patients should be screened for depression (see module 27) or anxiety (see module 26) before further workup for obscure or unlikely somatic diseases include the following: While it is important for you to understand your patients' problems and their perspective on these problems, it may be just as important to communicate this understanding to your patients. Without doing this, your patients may not appreciate that you have understood the nature and the severity of their problems or their concerns, goals, and expectations about them. You can communicate your understanding by briefly reviewing what you have learned and by expressing empathy (i.e. I can understand how difficult this must be for you) and legitimation (i.e. given this circumstance, it is normal to feel the way you have been feeling.). |Create trust and confidence| | | Patients with greater trust in their physicians are more satisfied with their care, more likely to adhere to their physician's recommendations, and less likely to change physicians. In fact, trust is one of the most important variables in relating to positive health outcomes. ( Patients with greater trust in their physicians are more satisfied with their care, more likely to adhere to their physician's recommendations, and less likely to change physicians. Trust comes from the successful accomplishment of many of the tasks in the therapeutic process (i.e. understanding patients and their problems, demonstrating interest and concern and informing and involving patients' in the decision making process). This process for creating trust was supported by a recent study, which surveyed patients who had a first visit with a cardiologist, neurologist, nephrologists, gastroenterologist, or rheumatologist at a Harvard medical school faculty practice. ( [8](9_0.htm#8)) In this study, 79% of patients reported complete confidence and trust in the specialist. Patients were more trusting if they reported that the specialist listened, that they received as much information as they wanted, were told what to do if problems or symptoms continued, got worse, or returned; were involved in decisions as much as they wanted; and they spent as much time as they wanted with the specialist. It is particularly important to outline possible management options, explain the risk of benefits of each option, and offer patients opportunities to participate in decisions about their care. Patients and physicians should be clear about the goals of care and these goals must be realistic. Patients understand that not all diagnoses are accurate and not all treatments work, so they want to know how to monitor their course and what to do if things don't go as expected. Establishing this type of safety net will enhance your patient's trust in you as their physician. |Demonstrating Interest and Concern| | | Making obvious your interest in the patient as a special person is the central task in establishing a healing and therapeutic relationship. Patients are more trusting, cooperative and satisfied; and your work is simpler, more efficient, timely, accurate and satisfying. Giving attention to enhancing your relationships with patients results in more trust, more optimism about plans and better adherence to them, easier resolution of conflicts, and more open and frank discussion of difficult topics, such as bad news, sexual problems, or post-operative complications. Patients are more satisfied, your work is more efficient and malpractice suits less likely. For many patients, your personal attention imparts a refreshing boost in self-esteem, so central to getting on with life. We briefly review the skills for accomplishing this central task. More depth and additional strategies are presented in Module 6. Demonstrate your interest by spending a few moments at each visit getting to know your patients' social situations, job, hobbies and interests. Engaging in this more personal relationship not only makes your work easier (as above), but it reminds you that you are taking care of a person not simply another \"case\" of hypertension. |Use multiple strategies to demonstrate your concern| | | Commit yourself to expressing your interest verbally, non-verbally and in small gestures. Display your commitment to patients by going out of your way to provide services that are not strictly required. Give patients sample medications, communicate results of tests in a timely manner, call to see if they are feeling better or have quit smoking. Such simple gestures can easily become part of your routine, and patients appreciate these expressions of your concern for their well-being. Communicate your interest directly by expressing support and partnership in difficult situations. For example, if you determine that a patient has depression, but is not willing to accept treatment, you can communicate your support by saying, \"I am interested in helping you, even though you are not ready to do anything right now. Come in any time you wish and we can figure out together how to help you feel better.\" Express your interest non-verbally as well. For example, in hospital you can sit down at the bedside. Taking a moment to pull up a chair, and maintaining eye contact reveals your concern, whereas standing up creates the impression that you wish to leave as soon as possible. See Module 14 for more non-verbal skills. |Informing and Involving Patients in their Care| | | Information about a patient's disease and its management can be helpful or overwhelming, and is easily forgotten. Tailor the information you provide so that it enables patients to understand diagnosis and management plans. Encourage patients to participate as much (or as little) as they like in their own care. Providing information about patients' disease and its management (see Module 10) can relieve anxiety, promote greater adherence to the management plan, and increase patient satisfaction. Patient education also enables patients to monitor their treatment outcomes and appropriately respond if they fail to improve as expected. Informed patients can more easily play an active role in decisions about their care. The process of educating patients begins with an assessment of their beliefs, concerns, and need for information. ( [9](9_0.htm#9)) All patients want to know their diagnosis and management plan, but not all want to understand the pathophysiology or the pharmacology of their medications. Some patients cope with stressful situations by monitoring their environment for information about that situation. More information is comforting, even though it may not enable them to do anything differently. Other patients prefer not to focus on gathering more information, because going beyond just the basic information provokes additional stress. Never assume that patients will understand, believe, or remember what you tell them. Evidence shows that patients do not understand (or forget) about half of what you tell them. You can increase their understanding and adherence to management recommendations by providing them with educational handouts, by writing down the things you both agree that they will do, and by asking them to review what they have learned and what they plan to do as a result of your discussion. The skills and strategies are described in Modules 11 and 12. |Provide supportive counseling| | | Counseling interventions to help people cope with health problems and to help them follow plans are among the most cost-effective things a physician can do to prevent disease and improve health status. Supportive counseling helps patients change unhealthy behaviors, and helps them cope more effectively with health problems or stressful life events. Counseling goes well beyond providing information, but giving information skillfully is the foundation of excellent supportive counseling. Counseling is an interactive process that includes assessing patients' perceptions and self-efficacy, attentive listening about values, priorities and goals, problem-solving about barriers and obstacles, and reaching agreement on negotiated goals (as opposed to your prescribing the goals). Aspects of counseling are given more space in Module 16 and other modules that discuss specific problems (such as alcohol, sex, end-of-life care, talking about mistakes.) |Stress Management| | | Patients want physicians to help with psychological distress. Discussion and ventilation with an attentive listener helps. Physicians who add empathic statements increase their ability to decrease emotional distress. About 60% of primary care patients indicate that it is at least somewhat important that physicians help them with their psychological distress. Most patients seek an opportunity to discuss the stress in their lives. ( [10](9_0.htm#10)) Effective approaches can be applied during a medical encounter, despite the limited time of visits. ( [11](9_0.htm#12)) Discussing the stress in the patient's life and encouraging emotional expression can have considerable therapeutic value. ( [12](9_0.htm#12)) Talking about a stressful situation with an attentive and reflective listener encourages patients to examine situations more carefully, and they may recognize that things are not as dismal as imagined. Simple ventilation of strong emotions to a nonjudgmental listener often provides relief. This activity enhances trust and prepares the ground for additional assistance, as the patient senses that \"my doctor cares about me.\" The therapeutic benefits of simple discussion and ventilation are enhanced when physicians demonstrate their caring by making reflective statements (e.g. \"I see that this is very difficult for you\"), legitimation (e.g. \"it is normal to feel the way you do\"), support (e.g. \"I am here to help in whatever way I can\"), partnership (e.g. \"we can figure out how to deal with this together\"), and respect (e.g. \"I am impressed by your clear thinking about this problem\"). (See Module 6) |Decide what you might do in addition to listening| | | Broadly speaking, deciding whether patients need help with problem solving, changing their thinking about distress, or discovering ways to better cope helps you organize your interventions. As you listen to the details, you should decide whether patients need help with problem solving, modifying negative cognitions about themselves and/or their problem, or finding adequate coping strategies. Problem solving includes several discrete steps: help patients identify goals (e.g. how will they benefit if they can change a stressful situation); brainstorm possible approaches and their likely outcomes; explore barriers to implementing these approaches; select an approach and develop an implementation plan; and monitor progress and outcomes. Your role in this process is primarily to guide patients in organizing their thinking and strategy, and working out each step by asking them questions (e.g. \"what are the ways you have thought about to resolve this problem?\") You may provide options or suggestions, but ultimately, patients must make the hard choices themselves about the best course of action. |Help patients change their perspective| | | People who change how they view problems reduce their distress without changing the situation itself. You can help patients explore their attributions of causality and of the potential for relief, and help them examine which specific life functions are actually disturbed. Many stressful problems can't be resolved, but you can help reduce patients' distress through helping change patients' thoughts (\"cognitions\") associated with these problems. Patients who make internal attributions about the cause of the problem (e.g. \"I did this to myself; I caused this\") experience more distress. Patients who also make stable attribution about its cause (e.g. \"it will never get better\") and global attributions (e.g. \"it affects everything about me\") compound their distress. These patients, who persistently believe that they are guilty or a failure, or that the inevitable result of a situations is complete disaster can be encouraged to more critically evaluate their beliefs. In addition to attentive and empathic listening, you can ask patients to reflect on why they are making these attributions, whether any evidence supports the attributions, and what other attributions about causes and effects might be possible. Many clinicians make the mistake of trying to reason with patients and persuade them that their thinking is incorrect. The dynamics of cognitive thinking predict that you will always fail to persuade; you can only assist patients in organizing their reflections on their cognitions, and coming to their own conclusions. |Suggest additional simple coping strategies| | | Additionally, clinicians can help patients adjust expectations, engage in rewarding activities, and make use of support networks. Clinicians can suggest strategies that will help patients cope more effectively, whether or not they plan to seek resolution of the problem or adjust their cognitions. One tactic is to encourage patients to readjust their expectations. Distress can be envisaged as the gap between expectations and reality. When problem solving fails to modify the reality and bring the situation more in line with expectations, you can help patients close the gap by readjusting their expectations. A second tactic is to encourage patients to more frequently engage in activities that are pleasurable, relaxing, or rewarding. Positive activities provide things to look forward to and deflect attention away from the negative situations, a kind of counterweight that balances against stressful problems. A third tactic is to encourage patients to take better advantage of their social support network. You can ask patients to identify the people in their life that they turn to for support. Sometimes patients have not shared their problems with family and friends, and need your encouragement to do so and to accept their support. We stress again that you cannot persuade patients to do any of these things, but when you present your ideas and suggestions in an empathic way that encourages reflection and dialog, you will have a positive effect. |Provision of effective reassurance about health concerns| | | Health concerns cause stress. Patients often seek care primarily for reassurance about these concerns. Your full and empathic evaluation of the problem (even problems that seem biologically very minor) and the beliefs and concerns forms the firm foundation for reassurance. ( The vast majority of patients with minor problems like an upper respiratory tract infection do not seek care. Those who do are usually more worried than patients who decide to manage the problem on their own. Ask questions like, \"What have you thought these symptoms might be due to?\" Patients' answers will alert you to their might desire for reassurance and give you information about their specific concern. (see Module 9) When your initial impression is that reassurance would be appropriate, strive to more fully understand the basis of the concerns. Ask, \"What makes you think this may be a serious problem?\" and \"What worries you the most about this problem?\" Patients will not accept reassuring statements unless they believe that you fully understand that their symptoms are distressing and complex and mystifying. Consequently, giving them time and prompts to fully express their symptoms, and then expressing your understanding by summarizing what you have heard and making an empathic statement (e.g. I can really understand how difficult these symptoms must be for you) not only gives you important data about the situation, but forms the foundation for effective reassurance. (See Module 8) After you complete these explorations and show your understanding, educating patients corrects erroneous beliefs and provides the rationale for your conclusions and reassurance. (see Module 10) Discuss with patients about indications that a reevaluation or a change in management might be in order. We can with full confidence tell a patient that her headaches do not indicate or mask a more serious hidden problem, but we can rarely be one hundred percent certain about this. Patients appreciate a list of specific findings they can use to determine if further evaluation is indicated. In this situation, you might tell her to come back for additional examination if the headaches increase in frequency or severity, fail to improve over the next two weeks, or wake her from sleep. |When you must temper your reassurance, or it is rejected by patients| | | Some patients accept your rationale and reassurance but others do not. The only way you can determine which patients are reassured is to ask them. You can ask, \"How worried are you now?\" and, \"Are you thinking we should do additional tests at this time?\" If patients still desire diagnostic tests, you can choose to perform tests if risks and costs are minimal and you think that the therapeutic benefit of the reassurance will be substantial. Because the therapeutic benefit is usually small and always hard to predict, you better serve your patients by giving a clear rationale for not testing, responding to their feelings (see Module 13) with empathy and support about the \"bad news\" (see Module 33) that you will not test right now, and negotiating a mutually agreeable follow up plan. (see Module 11) Sometimes patients' concerns are appropriate to the potential seriousness of their problem. Do not provide false reassurance, and also do not discuss all the potential consequences until you are more certain of the outlook. To the degree that is realistic, your most important function is to be clear that optimism and hope are in order. The hope you provide should be consistent with a realistic set of goals. Do not raise the hope of patients with metastatic cancer that they will live another X years, but reassure them that they will not experience much pain and that with your support, they will remain in control of decisions about their care. (See Module 34) Expressing your compassion and your ongoing personal support (\"non-abandonment,\" see Module 33) is in itself a way to increase patients' hope. |Modifying maladaptive and unhealthy behaviors| | | You can help patients change unhealthy behaviors, and make a big difference in their current and future health. There are helpful concepts, and a number of skills that you can learn that will promote behavior change. Many major health problems result from unhealthy or maladaptive individual behaviors that are of complex origin and extremely resistant to change. These include smoking, drinking, drug abuse, gambling, and domestic violence, to name a few. You may find it hard to understand why patients do not follow plans they have agreed to- they often do not keep appointments or see consultants, fail to take medications or accept your recommendations for procedures. You can learn specific skills for assisting with behavior change. Promoting behavioral change is presented fully in module 16 and counseling related to specific behaviors is discussed in module 24 (smoking cessation), 25 (diet and exercise), 29 (alcoholism), and 30 (drug abuse). In this section we summarize essential points of counseling for behavior change. Your initial challenge is to establish a strong relationship with patients, and then to develop the skills for quality patient education, exploration of motivational factors and appropriate counseling strategies. It is important to preserve this relationship by not being judgmental or threatening when discussing the need to modify a patient's behavior. Avoid lecturing patients about the adverse consequences of their behavior, since most patients will already know much of this information. It is usually much more effective to begin by empathizing with the difficulty of changing behavior and then to ask patients what they see as the benefits to them, if they were able to change the behavior, and then to assess their level of motivation to change their behavior at this time. Patients who are not ready to change their behavior will need motivational counseling. Two types of issues can prevent patients from being ready to make the effort to change a maladaptive behavior. First, they might not fully comprehend the risks associated with that behavior and the benefits of changing it. In addressing this issue, you should remember to take advantage of the teachable moment (i.e. any time the patient is already experiencing an adverse consequence of the behavior you wish to change). You can highlight the relationship between this behavior and this problem. Before adding more reasons why the patient should change their behavior, ask the patient about their understanding of the current and future consequences of this behavior and the benefits of changing it. This type of information will be more persuasive if the patient says it rather than if you say it. In discussing the benefits of changing the behavior, it is often more effective to emphasize more immediate benefits (like saving money if you quit smoking) then the more remote benefits that won't happen for a long time and don't happen to everyone. Patients often fully understand the need to change their behavior, but still seem reluctant to try to attempt to do so. This is usually because they don't think they will succeed if they try. For them, the barriers to change are perceived as too great. This, therefore, is the second issue that needs to be addressed. The key question to ask is \"What makes changing this behavior hard for you?\" Once you understand their barriers to change, you can begin to help your patients develop a plan to overcome their barriers. In developing this plan, several principles must be kept in mind. First, try not to tell patients what to do to overcome their barriers, but rather help them figure this out for themselves. Sometimes it is necessary to provide patients with options, but after listing a few strategies they might employ, it is important to ask if any of these strategies sound like they might work for them. The second principle is to keep the plan simple. If it sounds too difficult, patients won't try to do it. For example, if you tell a patient who is concerned about weight gain if they try to quit smoking that they can overcome this barrier by exercising, the patient is likely to conclude, \"why bother? It is hard enough to try to quit smoking. I don't think I will be able to also start an exercise program.\" The third principle is, make the plan as specific as possible. Telling a patient that they should diet and exercise, will have little meaning and effect, unless you can negotiate specific changes in the patient's eating habits and a specific plan to exercise that includes the type of exercise, frequency, and duration. You can also increase your patients' sense of control over the target behavior by discussing the reasons why you believe they can be successful, if they try. You might mention other successes the patient has achieved, your support for this effort, and the plan you will develop together. If the patient has tried to change their behavior in the past, you can explain that behavior change often involves several unsuccessful efforts before you finally succeed. Each time you try however, you can learn something from that effort that will help you the next time you try to change your behavior. You can then review what patients have learned from previous efforts to change their behavior and what they can do differently this time. The more confidence patients have about their chances to succeed, the more motivated they will be to try to change their behavior. When developing a behavioral change plan, several issues should be addressed. First, the goals should be explicit and realistic. Patients should not be merely told to lose weight, but should be informed that an appropriate initial goal might be to lose 5% to 10% of their body weight since this will achieve most of the medical benefits from weight loss. Second you should ask the patient to set a behavioral change date. This will provide structure and let you know when to see them in follow-up (usually one to two weeks following this date). Third, you need to help the patient create an environment that will support their effort to change their behavior. For cigarette smokers for example, this means getting rid of cigarettes, ashtrays, and lighters and telling everyone they know in advance, that they are quitting and that the cigarette smokers can help them by not smoking in front of them and not giving them any cigarettes. Third, you should help the patient identify their barriers to change and the things that trigger the maladaptive behavior and then develop a plan to overcome their barriers and either avoid their triggers or not succumb, if they are exposed to them. Fourth, the behavioral change plan should include rewards that highlight the benefits of their efforts. Patients who quit smoking can gain a greater appreciation of the financial benefits of smoking cessation by setting aside the money they would have spent on buying cigarettes and using that money every week to reward themselves. Fifth, patients should be encouraged to identify people who can support their efforts to change their behavior and to use them as needed. Finally, the plan should include ongoing follow-up and monitoring in the physician's office and possibly in a community based program. |CONCLUSION| | | Health problems and their associated symptoms develop out of a complex process that not only includes biological factors, but also patients' beliefs, feelings and behaviors and the interpersonal and intrapersonal factors that can affect them. Bio-technical interventions can modify the underlying somatic alterations that contribute to these health problems. The beliefs, concerns, emotional distress, and behaviors are most effectively addressed in trusting and supportive relationship with the clinician, through communication about the issues. The therapeutic value of the encounter itself can be maximized by focusing on six essential tasks: A variety of cognitive, affective, and behavioral strategies are suitable and available to accomplish each of these tasks. The effective application of these strategies will lead not only to improved outcomes of care, but also to increased professional satisfaction and practice growth and a decreased risk of malpractice litigation. |LITERATURE REFERENCES| To proceed, click on the horizontal navigation bars at the left side.

We will be satisfied and effective clinicians only if we find healthy methods for coping with stress.| We cannot reach our potential as healers if we ourselves are unhealthy in body, mind or spirit. We cannot be fully present for our patients or colleagues if we are depressed, anxious, or distracted by personal problems. In this module we explore the landscape of personality, study, and demanding professional work through three stories. We examine ways that Jill, a medical student; Bill, a resident; and Lisa, a young practicing physician, strive to find and sustain professional satisfaction and personal well-being. Personal issues and challenges at each stage of professional development are different but overlapping. Jim, Bill and Lisa each cope with stresses and grow personally and professionally through engaging in personal reflection and seeking counsel. We comment on psychological and social factors that influence their attitudes and behaviors, and on the healthy choices and strategies they develop to align their actions with the values they cherish. |Questions for Reflection:| | | |Key Principles:| | | |Learning goals:| | | At completion of this module, you will be able to: |THE LANDSCAPE: PERSONALITY AND STUDY| In the first section of this module you'll find the following: |The Imposter Syndrome: am I good enough?| | | Certain marker events in trainingsuch as medical school graduation, becoming a senior resident, finishing residency, starting a first jobcan lead to an inner expectation of competence that is not congruent with our own self-doubts. Many physicians suffer from an \"imposter syndrome\" in the early stages of their career. |Case: Jill, a medical student| | | Doing \"only\" moderately well while constantly studying and working feels inadequate when compared with carefree college days at the head of the class. Jill Rayburn wondered if she would ever have fun again. She studied for her pathophysiology exam for a week, hadn't slept in 30 hours and still felt ill prepared. She wondered whether she was cut out for medicine, in spite of being in the upper 20% of her class. Many classmates seemed unthreatened by the mountain of material to be mastered for this exam, and some had even gone for a hike yesterday. Last night Jill declined an invitation to play indoor soccer. She was beginning to resent the professor who invited her to co-author a paper, even though she felt flattered and honored to be singled out. Now she didn't feel up to working on the paper, and wished she'd started preparing for this exam earlier. She remembered many carefree days in high school and college, when she was consistently at the top of her class. What had happened to that teenager with the sense of humor and time to hang out with friends? Looking ahead to the remainder of the winter, she saw no respite, only more deadlines and lonely days in the library. |Compulsivity is a normal physician trait| |Physician compulsivity, with characteristic doubts, guilt and an exaggerated sense of responsibility, produces benefits for patients, but if unbalanced, can produce fatigue, cynicism and isolation in physicians.| Compulsivity, with its beneficial attributes of thoroughness, accuracy, second guessing, and monitoring changes, is a common physician habit. Compulsivity contributes to success in getting into medical school, completing training and high quality patient care. If not balanced through reflection and non-compulsive activities, however, this habit erodes physicians' well-being. Jill manifests many aspects of compulsivity that can trigger cynicism and burnout by the time she is a resident. For example, she doubts her competence, in spite of evidence of excellent performance. She assesses her progress in reference to the perceived mastery of her peers, and in her fatigue cannot imagine attaining success in medicine. Jill will become dysfunctional if this neurotic thinking progresses into the \"imposter syndrome,\" in which she feels she somehow fools others into thinking she is competent, while the threat of being unmasked lurks at every turn. Additionally, Jill feels guilt about unwise allocation of her time, as no matter how hard she has worked, it does not seem to be enough. In addition to self-doubt and guilt, Jill also carries a burden of responsibility for meeting deadlines and obligations, and feels alone with that burden. She wonders about her peers' enjoying an outing together and envisions her own continued isolation in the library. This triad of doubt, guilt, and an exaggerated sense of responsibility are well-described as constituents of the \"normal\" compulsivity trait in physicians.( [1](9_0.htm#1)) In summary, the triad of compulsive behaviors that lead to overwork and burnout are the following: Compulsivity is one of the traits that can lead to a \"psychology of postponement\" that avoids honoring the important values and relationships in our lives. ( [2](9_0.htm#2)) |\"Psychology of postponement\"| |Postponing relaxation, sleep and relationships begins early and can become habitual, and one consequence of this habit is that life may seem not worth living.| In the back of our minds we may have the nagging thought that this overwork is not good for us, that taking care of ourselves by getting enough sleep, exercise, eating well, having fun, and spending time with friends are all important; but in the \"psychology of postponement\"( [2](9_0.htm#2)) we keep thinking, \"As soon as this exam is over, then I can unwind.\" The need to stay on top of our game, however, multiplies this bargaining with ourselves: \"As soon as I get into the residency I want, then I can relax;\" \"as soon as I get accepted for a fellowship, then I can start working out;\" \"as soon as I start my first real job, then I can have a life.\" Thus early in medical training a habit of postponement can develop that if unchecked can lead to neglecting many of our most valued relationships and activities throughout our career. Sir William Osler, in a commencement address to graduating medical students in 1889, had these words to say about postponement: \"Engrossed late and soon in professional cares...you may so lay waste that you may find, too late, with hearts given way, that there is no place in your habit-stricken souls for those gentler influences which make life worth living.\"( [3]) |The \"Hidden Curriculum\"| |The internal linking of exceptional performance and achievement with personal worth is a characteristic learned early by hard working people, and an impossible standard for medical students.| Jill's torment has its roots in the early conditioning of many bright young people in American society, and medical schools exaggerate this characteristic as part of the \"hidden curriculum.\" We assimilated the message that our worth as persons is linked to academic success or outward performance. The need for love and acceptance is inherent in being human, and children who are repeatedly told they are valued only when they are \"exceptional\" link personal worth to meeting extraordinary standards. The achievement standard accompanies many students into medical school and collides with the reality that their peers are also top performers. They construe failure to stand out as failing to meet an essential marker of worthiness. We can choose to back off from overwork and carry the self-stigma of being \"ordinary,\" and unconsciously feel less lovable; or choose to work harder to stand out. Paradoxically, striving to \"stand out\" can lead to the very isolation and loneliness from which we are trying to escape. The hidden curriculum also interacts with our need to conform to group norms. Our need to \"fit in\" mirrors the power of our drive to \"stand out.\" The new science of interpersonal neurobiology shows that we are wired to belong to groups; when we feel we belong brain opiate levels increase. Conversely the perception of being at risk for alienation from the group correlates with opiate decrements.4 This neurochemistry may produce \"groupthink\" and reluctance to question the group's direction. If group norms tend to move us in ways that run counter to our values or diminish our health and well-being or that of others, it can require a heroic level of assertiveness to challenge them. (see \"workplace health\" et. seq., below) |Hidden curriculum effects - insidious and pervasive| | | Students and faculty are trapped by the effects of rewarding overwork. Jill's story also illustrates the insidious manner in which the system of medical education with its overt and covert rewards and punishments can reinforce inherent compulsivity. Her exceptional performance was noticed by one of her professors, who asked her to co-author a paper. It is natural for teachers to ask top performers to do more, yet neither the teacher nor the student pauses to reflect on the potential toxicity of rewarding overwork. Medical school traditionally is good at channeling students into ever refined strata of academic and professional success, but not so good at mentoring them into building a career in which their professional endeavors unfold within a context of a healthy life well lived. Unless Jill were to encounter a mentor that has this broader grasp of personal and professional well-being, her role models and professors will continue unwittingly to provide a \"hidden curriculum,\" in which being a successful physician entails putting one's own life on hold. |Hidden curriculum makes capable students feel unworthy| | | The \"hidden curriculum\" in medicine teaches that success as a physician entails suspending any effort to balance your own life. Some people successfully counteract the insidious effects of the hidden curriculum. Look toward faculty members and mentors who intentionally seek balance in their personal and professional lives to help you thwart these pressures. |Jill meets a mentor| | | Guidance from an experienced faculty member can counter effects of the hidden curriculum. Dr. Ann Bennington, a teacher from a class on the medical interview, noticed Jill's hunched posture and drawn facial expression. \"Jill, you look like you have the weight of the world on your shoulders. How are you doing?\" Jill managed a smile and protested, \"I'm fine. I just finished the pathophys exam.\" Ann confronted her mildly, \"Well you look exhausted. When's the last time you had an evening off?\" When she noticed a tear forming, Ann replied, \"Jill, I suspect you're carrying more of a burden than you let on.\" She suggested they meet that afternoon. At the meeting in Dr. Bennington's office, Jill slowly opened up with the self-doubt, emptiness, fatigue, and isolation she was feeling. Ann replied, \"You know, Jill, you remind me of myself when I was a medical student.\" Noticing Jill's tears, she continued, \"The fact that you are one of the brightest people in your class doesn't seem to matter to you now. Like me you are a perfectionist, and one effect of that perfectionism is that we don't feel we can get enough external validation for our worth. That's because we weren't taught to value ourselves from within, to know that we have immense worth before we ever set out to do great things.\" She paused to observe Jill's response. Since she was breathing more freely and seemed curious, Ann continued: \"Striving for excellence is not wrong, and is in fact desirable. But what we mean by 'excellence' needs to be challenged. Your work will always occur within a real world context of the values you hold and commitments you make, as well as the limitations of time, personal energy, and competing tasks. Bumping up against these limits can be humbling, but ultimately accepting those limits and accepting your gifts will give you some freedom. Your body, mind and spirit are giving you feedback that you shouldn't ignore. To the extent you can let your awareness of the origin of this pain lead you to greater self-acceptance, you will be an excellent physician and a healing presence for others.\" |Appreciating Versus Judging and Evaluating| | | The deleterious effects of \"judgment\" can be counterbalanced by cultivating \"appreciation.\" |We are \"becoming\", not yet \"there\"| | | Appreciating who we are instead of judging what we are not yet reminds us that we are \"becoming.\" Among perspectives worth cultivating in the pursuit of well-being is the awareness that lack of perfection is an inherent part of the lengthy process of becoming a physician. It is helpful to think of ourselves as \"becoming\" rather than insisting on holding an image of what we are not yet, and then unfavorably comparing ourselves to that image. The pressures inherent in medical training to continuously evaluate performance and judge one's own competence are oppressive, and can be balanced through cultivation of the capacity for \"appreciation.\" When we respond to a sunset, to the first flower blooming in the garden in spring, or to the final movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, this is typically not an act of judgment, but one of appreciation. We do not exercise the \"judgment\" and \"appreciation\" centers of our minds at the same time. An example of this tension was illustrated in a spiritual retreat. Participants on the retreat were asked to spend two hours one afternoon in silence, without books or other cognitive distractions, simply attending to what they observed through their senses. One physician reported he spent two hours watching a caterpillar on the ground, wondering what led it to choose one direction over another. When the caterpillar arrived at a road, he debated with himself whether he should help it across the road or not. The group was moved by his story and shared their appreciation with him. In the post-retreat evaluation he wrote the following: \"I didn't understand why it was such a big deal. But I started to think more about itthe feeling of wonder, suspension of judgment, trying to help but not being sure if I was being helpful. I'm good at feeling wonder about people and nature. I need to be better at feeling wonder and joy when pondering and observing me.\" |Collaboration is an essential competency. Cultivate the practice of working cooperatively.| | | Physicians are always part of a team working on behalf of their patients; whether in the hospital, the operating room or the office. Learning to collaborate as a member of a team counteracts an exaggerated sense of personal responsibility, and committing yourself to working cooperatively reduces isolation and mitigates the harmful effects of competitiveness on your health and well-being. The competition to get into medical school and advance through training reinforces an exaggerated sense of personal responsibility. This attitude is too frequently carried forward into subsequent practice, in which the illusion is maintained that you are a self-sufficient professional, that asking for help is a sign of weakness, and that competency is distinguished by your ability to \"go it alone.\" Nothing could be further from the way health care is actually delivered. Systematic attempts to improve quality and reduce error demand that teams of professionals from various disciplines work cooperatively to provide patient care and promote the health of the community. The best medical schools are training for this, and the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) states that \"systems-based practice\" and \"professionalism,\" which involve working as part of a team, are core competencies to be mastered during residency. Whether or not teamwork is reinforced by your medical school or residency, cultivating the practice of working cooperatively with others and committing yourself to helping colleagues succeed can contribute enormously to your personal and professional satisfaction. |Reinforcing a maturing value structure| | | A mentor guides through dialog and by example. Jill's encounters with Dr. Bennington, along with Ann's willingness to discuss the importance of honoring life values, show that senior physicians who have struggled to attain life wisdom can exert a powerful influence toward reversing the effects of the hidden curriculum. In choosing mentors, students would do well to seek out physicians who tolerate the tension of keeping a balance in their personal and professional lives and explicitly honor and value family relationships, friendships, recreational pursuits, hobbies, and personal self-care. In April of her 4th year of medical school Jill dropped by Dr. Bennington's office. \"How are you feeling about the match?\" Ann asked. \"Well, to tell you the truth,\" Jill replied, \"my initial first choice was a program where I could have pursued work based on that paper I co-authored. Since the match, however, I've thought more about the program I'm going to, and especially about one faculty member who interviewed me. I was struck by his family pictures, his children's poems and drawings, and his sharing with me how much their training program valued both professionalism and the personal growth and life satisfaction of their residents.\" \"I'm glad I picked this program!\" Later, Jill sent Ann a note that read, \"Thank you for reaching out to me at a critical moment, and helping me realize there was more to me than trying to be a star. You helped me value humility, which includes both appreciation of what I have to offer and acceptance of my limitations. You also gave me the great gift of realizing my own capacity for appreciating my life and for letting that be the ground from which to appreciate others.\" Dr. Bennington responded with a note that contained this poem by Derek Wolcott that you'll find on the next page. By Derek Wolcott The time will come when, with elation you will greet yourself arriving at your own door, in your own mirror, and each will smile at the other's welcome, and say, sit here. Eat. You will love again the stranger who was yourself. Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart to itself, to the stranger who has loved you all your life, whom you ignored for another, who knows you by heart. Take down the love letters from the bookshelf, the photographs, the desperate notes, peel your own image from the mirror. Sit. Feast on your life. |THE LANDSCAPE: BURNOUT| | | \"Burnout\" results from chronic overwork, avoidance of renewing and energizing activities, and negative self-judgment.(5) Burnout is a syndrome to which health care professionals are vulnerable. Burnout leads to impaired job performance, health problems, and chemical dependency. It includes the following components: Burnout can lead to dissociation, decontextualization, and cynicism. |Case: Bill, a resident| Bill Trimmell trembled as he sat in the resident's room wondering why he had raised his voice and scolded his last patient about not doing enough to monitor her blood sugars and for expecting him to keep her pain-free. Fortunately he had stifled the impulse to unload onto her that he had persistent back pain since a fall, and yet dragged himself to work to take care of whining patients like her. As he elaborated this imaginary conversation, he suddenly asked himself, \"What am I doing?\" This was only the second patient of the afternoon, and already he couldn't wait to go home. His busy morning clinic included two walk-ins and one complex patient with lupus who was 10 minutes late and took an extra 20 minutes, putting him behind and leaving him 10 minutes to lunch on a stale bagel from the morning conference. He was only a third of the way through his second year of residency, and found himself resenting many of his patients and wondering what had happened to the altruistic dream of helping people that had led him into medical school. Why did he no longer care? |Mechanism| | | Burnout begins early in your career, and erodes your soul. Dissociation from feelings, treating people as objects and feeling ineffective are the usual symptoms of burnout Bill has classical signs and symptoms of burnout, which consists of emotional exhaustion (including compassion fatigue and dissociation from feelings in general), depersonalization in relationships (treating oneself, patients, coworkers, and family members as objects), and a perceived clinical ineffectiveness.( [5](9_0.htm#3)) Burnout is described as \"an erosion of the soul\" that sends people into a downward spiral. Burnout may manifest as impaired job performance, sleep disturbance, irritability, marital difficulties, fatigue, anxiety, or depression. It can also be associated with poor health, including headaches, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and chemical dependency. The seeds of burnout are sown in medical school and residency training, where fatigue and emotional exhaustion are often the norm. In mid-career, the reinforcements in the work setting for being a hard worker and placing service to others before self-care maintain the momentum of this burgeoning condition. Recovery is difficult if one remains in the circumstances that generate the symptoms. |Cynicism| | | In the absence of thoughtful reflection with colleagues, physicians develop cynicism about the futility of their efforts to help patients. All too often physicians are confronted with the reality of patients who are non-adherent to medical regimens, or who have chronic health problems that are refractory to all biomedical interventions. Unremitting exposure to cases in which their efforts appear futile leave physicians feeling like Sisyphus, who endlessly rolled a large stone to the top of a hill, only to have it come tumbling down again. Without the opportunity to discuss these common experiences with peers and faculty, cynicism about patients and the effectiveness of patient care creeps in. |Compassion fatigue| | | Physicians constantly in the presence of suffering may become unable to relate to themselves and others as individual persons with a full range of emotions and a unique life context. The relentless parade of human suffering can run our emotional tank dry, an experience that is called \"compassion fatigue.\" If we focus cognitively and visually on complex patient care problems or get absorbed in our \"to do\" list in order to survive the days of suffering, dissociation occurs. We withdraw attention from our emotions and somatic sensations, become anesthetized to feelings and experience difficulty connecting with family and friends once we leave work. The cognitive correlate of dissociation is decontextualization. We develop a habit of thinking of others (and even ourselves) in a utilitarian way that abstracts and constructs persons into categories that have usefulness for our jobs and getting tasks done in a timely way. This strategy ignores the life contexts in which we and others are embedded. We commence relating to patients as diagnoses or appointments on the schedule, to coworkers as facilitating or impeding our work, to family and friends as intruding or placing unrealistic demands on our time, and to ourselves as task-processing machines. Ward residents view their work in terms of the tasks involved in admitting and discharging patients, rather than in terms of the patient's experience of illness. After several months observing what teams of ward residents did and what they communicated among themselves, one medical anthropologist concluded that the job of the ward resident is \"getting rid of patients.\"( [6](9_0.htm#4)) |Isolation| | | Personal isolation is common and fosters a sense of loss of meaning. Carl Rogers once said that \"what is most personal is most universal.\" Nothing can be so personally isolating as the perception that one has lost one's way professionally. It is reminiscent of Dante's poignant lament at the opening of the Divine Comedy: \"In the middle of the road of my life I awoke in a dark wood where the true way was wholly lost.\" Nothing can be as healing and reassuring as discovering others who have traveled the same road and emerged as colleagues to admire and emulate. Retreats, support groups, and impromptu sharing of common experiences and struggles during lulls in the pace of work remind us that we are part of the human community and that we have the capacity for renewal and change. Bill understandably feels a disconnect between his previous sense of vocation and the present sense of futility about the perceived ineffectiveness of his work. He finds himself slipping into disillusionment and cynicism. His job as a resident has begun to feel meaningless. |Participate in Self-Care Activities| | | Participate in peer support groups and programs for personal renewal in order to avoid or heal burnout problems. In January of his second resident year, Bill attended a retreat offered by his program that focused on finding personal renewal in the work of caring for patients. In discussion, a senior resident shared that she had felt burned out and uncaring by the middle of her second year. Conversation led to the vulnerability of residents to burnout, and another resident disclosed that he was helped by observing a compassionate and patient faculty member at a dying patient's bedside and then discussing how he remained centered during the encounter. The faculty member reported that keeping a journal of memorable events from the day gave him an opportunity to reflect on meaningful encounters in a way that the time pressures of work precluded. As the group talked, it became clear to Bill that he was not alone with this erosion of meaning and that there were personal and group strategies for renewing his enthusiasm for medicine. |STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME BARRIERS TO WELL-BEING| | | Cultivating Emotional Intelligence restores compassion and enjoyment and helps cope with the stress of feeling that our actions may be futile. With practice we can find ways to steadily renew our energy, at work as well as in other settings. Reflecting on the day's or week's events, perhaps by writing down our thoughts, builds capacity for mindfulness and the ability to be present to the meaning of our work and the gifts we constantly receive from it. We build additional resilience and further sustain a sense of well-being if we combine strategies. |The concept of Emotional Intelligence (E.I.)| | | The cultivation and expansion of our emotional intelligence can help restore our capacity for compassion and enjoyment of work.( Emotional intelligence includes the following components: People with high emotional intelligence regard emotions as facts, rather than problems to be solved. They use their emotional intelligence to counteract dissociation and depersonalization. They discover that using components of emotional intelligence helps them develop connections with patients and colleagues. |Enhancing emotional intelligence improves relationships and teamwork| | | Noticing our emotions, naming them, disclosing them to another person, and discussing them develop our capacity for enjoyment and healthy relationships. Among the strategies for restoring our capacity for compassion and enjoyment of our work is the cultivation of \"emotional intelligence.\" Developing the self-awareness component of emotional intelligence is a challenge for clinicians who are encouraged to dissociate from their feelings as a way of being \"objective\" in their professional role. Developing our self-awareness assists us in maximizing the quality of our relationships, which in turn is a major contributor to the therapeutic process as well as to personal well-being. Emotional intelligence includes acquiring a language for emotions and enhancing our capacity for self-disclosure to others. The mirror of these aptitudes is the interest in recognizing emotions in other people, and the capability to do so. We can use our own emotions to develop hypotheses about what another person is feeling. We can learn to check out feelings with others, reflect feelings, comment on what we are observing, and receive the emotional disclosure of others without judgment. Development of these capacities seems entirely natural and instinctive for some learners, and foreign and difficult for others, depending on temperament, personality style and past experiences. |Assertiveness is central to authenticity in relationships| | | Being direct and authentic with others about what we think, feel, and want while tolerating their reactions and responses requires practice and intention. Valuing and employing this set of skills enables us to balance our needs with those of others and to build trusting relationships. Assertiveness is an interpersonal skill- the skill of being direct with others about what we think, feel, and want in a calibrated way, without whining, shouting, eye-rolling, hostility or belittling, for example. Problems arise when we deviate from being direct, either through habitually devaluing our needs and feelings and subordinating ourselves or through seeking to impose our own will while devaluing others' perspectives and interests. The need to \"fit in\" (above) can lead timid, self-effacing or \"sub-assertive\" people to hide their own viewpoints, feelings, and needs from scrutiny. They find it difficult to say \"No,\" become overloaded with responsibilities imposed by others and burn out. On the contrary, the continuing need to \"stand out\" or meet extraordinary standards can lead some people to an overly assertive or aggressive stance. They are often unaware or intolerant of others' feelings and needs. People who are aggressive in this way can allow their emotions to intrude on others, and can act out and become disruptive. Assertiveness is the path of clarity, respect and the authenticity that is required for meaningful and productive connections with others. Fostering emotional intelligence helps lead to a balancing of our own needs with those of others. We can become more self-aware, can develop a vocabulary for our emotions, can state our truth while tolerating the emotional responses others may make to that truth, and can set clear limits to the intrusions or transgressions of others. That is, we can more clearly assess our own needs, and calibrate our verbal and non-verbal expressions. In medical education and clinical practice assertiveness is essential to building trusting relationships, to influencing others with integrity and to giving feedback. A resource with excellent suggestions on how to enhance assertiveness is Your Perfect Right. (8) |The feeling of futility derives from thinking we can control outcomes| | | Loosening the sense of close linkage between your actions and patient outcomes helps inoculate against discouragement and futility. Bill's feeling of futility in caring for patients who did not get better in spite of his best efforts emanated from his own beliefs and expectations about control. Gaining clarity about the extent to which control is possible in the events of our lives, and in the profession of medicine in particular, is essential to satisfaction with our work. Generally, people tend to be more satisfied when they perceive greater control over outcomes for which they have some responsibility. We indeed can have enormous influence within the array of factors that contribute to illness and health, but must recognize that most patient care outcomes are multi-determined and dependent on forces beyond our control, including patient choices, genetic and environmental variables and the work of other team members. A humble, yet realistic way of relating to work is to acknowledge that your actions are one significant influence among many other significant influences on the outcome of a situation. Think in terms of \"influence\" rather than \"control\". Releasing the need for treatment outcome to be a marker of competence can provide a helpful cognitive framework for self-assessment. The Zen philosophy of focusing on \"right action\" in the momentwhether it is the exercise of empathy, conducting a careful physical exam, engaging in clinical reasoning, or performing a procedureis one way to relinquish this intense focus on positive outcomes. |Additional coping strategies for feelings of futility| | | Other cognitive tools that help inoculate against futility include the following: |Sustaining vitality through steady renewal of energy| | | Viewing work as a locus of \"energy renewal\" rather than \"energy depletion\" promotes sustainability.( |Looking at work as a locus of energy depletion is an unsustainable situation. Develop the ability to discover energy renewal in each moment, at work or elsewhere. In fact, competent clinical work includes a diversity of relationships which can and should bestow on us both inspiration and sustenance.| The notion of work as energy depletion is common to several unhealthy habits described above (compulsiveness, the psychology of postponement, dissociation from feelings, and tolerating conditions of burnout). Many physicians view weekends, vacations, and time with family as the opportunity to recharge and recapture a more expansive awareness. Some seek to expand the time available for recharging by working part-time. The converse of protected \"personal time\" is the intense compression of \"work time\" and the density of tasks to be processed in a given day. An altered state of consciousness may emerge during the surreal pursuit of the processing of tasks in which \"productivity\" is equated with \"being good.\" Physicians enter this trance in the presence of certain ritualistic cues (the door to the office, turning on the computer, checking the schedule, retrieving voice mails), and other effects of this state may include running an incessant \"to do\" list, looking for brief tasks to process in an illusory pursuit of \"closure,\" a shortened attention span, irritability in the presence of lengthy or labored conversations, a habit of checking and rechecking one's work, stewing about difficult interactions in the past, and worrying about future events. Steve McPhee, a professor of medicine at UCSF, contrasts solar-powered and gasoline-powered automobiles in thinking about energy in our daily lives.( [9](9_0.htm#6)) The notion of work as a locus of energy depletion (requiring a leaving of work to find energy renewal) is similar to the dependence of industrial societies on non-renewable fossil fuels. When a solar car uses energy, it opens panels that simultaneously draw energy from the sun. The fossil fuel model represents a view of oneself as an individual source of productivity and accomplishment, acting with agency upon the material world and upon people's lives to achieve outcomes. The solar car model suggests a view of oneself as a medium of energy exchange, a self-organizing system much like a candle flame that gives off light in the process of continuous transformation, a system that is embedded within, and a part of, larger self-organizing systems such as a doctor-patient relationship, a healthcare system, a society, the earth itself.( [10](9_0.htm#7)) |Mindfulness brings the steady renewal concept into practice| | | Intentional attention to our inner states facilitates renewal at work. Our stream of consciousness typically includes thoughts about the past, sometimes accompanied by regret or resentment, and thoughts and images of the future, sometimes threatening, sometimes escapist. The \"productivity trance\" (above) drives us to run our \"to-do\" lists as an incessant background refrain. What is the psychological equivalent of \"opening our solar panels,\" to prepare ourselves for renewal as we move through our days, both at work and at home? One straightforward approach is mindfulness, the discipline of living an intentional, conscious life. Mindfulness is a counterweight to enchantment with the \"there and then,\" and increases our capacity to be present in the \"here and now.\" Mindfulness involves non-judgmental attention to our emotional and mental states as they pass through awareness. Mindfulness is on the one hand simple, and on the other hand requires practice to become proficient, as with any skill. ( [11-18](9_0.htm#8)) Becoming mindful imparts many benefits, and might be considered an important component of professionalism. We can be present to patients without contamination from what happens before or after that encounter. ( [16-17](9_0.htm#13)) We see ourselves as vessels through which the various feelings of joy, sorrow, anger, affection, peace and agitation flow, but these feelings do not define who we are in any moment of intensity. Mindfulness is then the gateway to accessing opportunities for personal renewal in the midst of work, if we intentionally attend to receiving energy from personal interactions or the satisfaction of work well done. ( [19](9_0.htm#15)) |Aspects of mindfulness| | | Mindfulness is a practice and a gateway that opens opportunities for self-renewal as we move through the day.( Mindfulness is the practice and habit of being present to where we are and what we're doing. This skill of \"being present\" requires practice to become fully cultivated and developed into a habit. The investment in acquiring this skill reaps dividends in enhanced relationships and personal balance. A group of primary care physicians who underwent intensive training in mindfulness showed significant improvements in non-judgmental attention to the present moment, reduction in burnout and mood disturbance, increased empathy toward patients, and improvement in personality factors of conscientiousness and emotional stability. These changes endured several months after completion of the training.(18) Rituals may be as simple as a conscious pause before entering a patient's room. We can also use recurrent contextual cues (such as each time we cross a threshold from one room to another) as reminders to pause, attend to our breath, and refocus our sensory awareness on the event into which we entering. Mindfulness helps us to attend without judgment, and to not let single encounters, thoughts, or events define who we are. (module 2) |\"Being Human is a Guest House\"| | | Attention to the daily surprises at work and in our inner lives can guide us toward well-being. The process of approaching each day with mindfulness and openness to the uncertainty of who will walk in the door next, and non-judgmental attention to the \"weather\" of our own emotions and those of others, is captured in this poem by Rumi, the 13th century Sufi mystic whose verses reach across the centuries and cultures to speak to our own experience ( [20](9_0.htm#16)): The Guest House This being human is a guest house. Every morning a new arrival. A joy, a depression, a meanness, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Even if they're a crowd of sorrows, who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture, still, treat each guest honorably. He may be clearing you out for some new delight. The dark thought, the shame, the malice, meet them at the door laughing, and invite them in. Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond. |Regularly engaging in reflection promotes well-being| | | If we incorporate a moment of reflection at the end of each day, we gradually become conditioned to perceive the opportunities for personal renewal and meaning contained in various encounters of the day. Using a journal or just pausing to reflect back for five to ten minutes on the events of the day can offer a transitional time to absorb the gifts that came our way, and let go of the day. Angeles Arrien suggests that we ask three simple questions: \"What surprised me today? What moved me today? What inspired me today?\"( [21](9_0.htm#17)) Sometimes we discover important personal meaning in our encounters with the full panoply of human experience, including suffering.( [22](9_0.htm#18)) Another option would be to keep a \"gratitude journal\" at the end of each week. Write down a few things for which you are thankful, from simple events like watching a particularly beautiful sunrise to more profound ones like a satisfying encounter with a patient with whom you had a previous troubling relationship. Building in reflective time increases our attentiveness to meaningful moments as they occur, and renews vitality. |Resilience derives from combining well-being strategies| | | Build resilience by combining well-being strategies, such as journaling, rituals, meditation, sharing uncomfortable feelings and stressors. In the weeks following his retreat, Bill experimented with briefly making daily journal entries. He began to notice sources of energy boost a joke shared with nurses, the satisfaction of being compassionately present to a patient's distress, learning a new diagnostic algorithm for certain illnesses, guiding an intern in managing a complex admission, observing a faculty preceptor facilitate a difficult family meeting about end-of-life care. Bill started an introductory book on mindfulness meditation and was sometimes able to take 5 minutes to practice meditation before his day began. Some days were incredibly busy, and he was still confronted with uncertain medical dilemmas and difficult patients, but he seemed to take it more in stride. He more frequently centered himself before walking into the patient's room by taking a couple of breaths and letting go of what went before, while embracing the unknown of the encounter awaiting him. Bill enjoyed the comradeship of his fellow residents and more often shared stresses and uncertainties. He felt more grounded, less isolated and experienced his work as more meaningful. |PROFESSIONAL WORK, INTIMACY AND FRIENDSHIP| | | Demands of professional work conflict with the rest of life, and learning to honor deeply held values by distinguishing between the urgency and importance of a demand helps to balance your life. Regularly engaging with friends and building intimacy through the sharing of dilemmas and conflict builds intimacy. Successfully coping with the stresses of long-term intimate partnerships, including managing feelings about money, further sustains well-being. Subordinating relationships to work demands can erode relationships. Professional responsibilities collide with relationship needs and personal commitments. On any given day it might make sense to let work demands take priority. Cumulatively, however, repeated instances of subordinating personal values leads to erosion of cherished relationships and to neglect of vital parts of our lives. |Case: Lisa's family conflict| Lisa Logan tried hard to keep on schedule in order to get to her daughter Megan's soccer game at 5:00, and was nearing the end of seeing her own patients and precepting residents. This was 6-year-old Megan's first game of the season, and this commitment was of special importance to Lisa because last month she was an inpatient attending and had seen very little of her two children. Roger, age 4, complained to Lisa's husband David that he \"hardly saw Mommy any more.\" This was Lisa's fifth year on the residency program faculty, and she had hoped that by now her routine would be more balanced. Throughout residency David, an attorney whom she married at the end of medical school, was understanding and tolerant of her late nights and often irregular rotations. Lisa took maternity leave during her second year of residency, but it seemed all too short and she felt she missed many of Megan's developmental milestones. She regretted that David had to cancel their last anniversary dinner reservation because she was managing a difficult patient's admission. They did have a pleasant evening out the following night, but it was not the same for her. Earlier today David called to say he might miss Megan's game, since the case he had hoped to settle was going to trial. Since Megan had a ride to the game with her friend's mother, could Lisa meet her there? Lisa was on track when her last patient, who had been trying to get in for two weeks because of intermittent dizziness and headaches, called. Mrs. Albright had a flat tire, and would be a half hour late. If Lisa stayed to see Mrs. Albright, who had been waiting two weeks to see her, she would miss most of Megan's game. |For the Goddess of Love| | | The \"psychology of postponement\" mentioned above finds poignant expression in this poem by Rabindranath Tagore ( For the Goddess of Love There is a ruined temple near here....No one sings now for the Holy One who was once praised there. The air is motionless and heavy above the altar. The odor of flowers no long pulled for you floats in through the door. One of your old worshippers goes out every day into the cities, hoping to receive the good things that he used to ask for from you. And every day at dusk he returns five thousand miles to his temple, his shoelaces untied, his face tired. How many good days go by! How many nights useful for worship go by, and not one candle is lit or one poem sung! How many sculptors work the whole day with large shoulders and hair whitened with stone dust making a statue of you, and then as dusk comes carry it to the river and throw it in. She is still in the temple, but no one gives Her food or takes food from Her, in this ignorance that never ends. |Honoring deeply held values: urgency versus importance| | | How we spend time and energy everyday manifests our value hierarchy, and taking a close look at both the urgency and the importance of what we do may reveal that our actions fail to honor what we thought were our deeply held values. Steven Covey, in The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,( [24](9_0.htm#20)) suggests that we compare the urgency of a demand or a potential activity with its importance in our value hierarchy, before we act. To compare, we can construct a 2 X 2 matrix with four quadrants: | | IMPORTANT | | NON IMPORTANT | | URGENT | | I | | III | | NON URGENT | | II | | IV Actions in Quadrant I are both important and urgent, and we neglect them at great peril; examples might include an ICU patient who is crashing, a sick family member, and completing tax returns on April 14. Quadrant III is the area of deception, where things take on the illusion of importance because of the noise of urgency. Failure to discriminate between I and III forces us to overload by responding to emails, voicemails, meetings, and interruptions that can overwhelm our carrying capacity. Most overloaded people escape into Quadrant IV, the area of waste, where we might mindlessly watch T.V., read cereal boxes, surf the internet, or aimlessly rummage through old files. Quadrant II is where we honor our deepest human values, nurture relationships with intimate partners and family, mentor others, continue our professional education, engage in strategic planning, attend to our own health needs, do volunteer work for the betterment of our communities, enhance our artistic abilities, and grow spiritually. Because many people view Quadrant II activities as \"non-productive\" and we value their approval, we may move to Quadrant III, carrying both the illusion of productivity and the appearance of busyness. Because of the intensity and even enchantment of the culture's \"productivity trance,\" our challenge is to discern which values belong in Quadrant II and regularly schedule time to honor them. |Sharing your personhood by disclosing dilemmas invites support| | | Patients and colleagues respond positively and support professionals who appropriately show their humanity by sharing their conflicts, dilemmas and values, even indirectly. Megan's soccer game was already on Lisa's schedule, but she now faced a choice between important valuesher patient responsibility and her commitment to her daughter. In some cases the burden of choosing can be shared ahead of time with patients, colleagues and family. To the extent that we can selectively disclose to patients those aspects of our personal lives that we are comfortable sharingeven indirectly by displaying photos of family members, pets or mountains we have climbedwe give ourselves permission to disclose a conflict when it occurs. Likewise we can share with family members the dilemmas that inevitably arise in caring for sick patients. Sharing with colleagues frequently brings mutual support for struggles to balance our personal and professional lives, and we become better able to help each other resolve conflicts. Lisa shared her dilemma about Megan with a colleague, Jim. From previous discussions Lisa knew that Jim held similar values about balancing work and home life, and she had covered for Jim during his father's illness. She asked if he could see Mrs. Albright for her. Jim agreed, and Lisa asked her nurse to assure Mrs. Albright that she would confer with Jim and telephone her tomorrow. Lisa felt confirmed in her decision when she saw Megan smile and wave as her team walked onto the field. |Build intimacy with friends, partners and family| | | In relationships outside of medicine we discover our potential as persons. The burden of constantly receiving patients' confidences can inhibit our capacity for self-disclosure and intimacy. In order to deepen friendships we must foster this capacity and be intentional about seeking time and settings to enrich these relationships. Physicians expend considerable time with patients and steadily receive their confidences and disclosures, but may have less familiarity with self-disclosure to friends, or time to engage with them in this intimate way. A fear of intimacy or lack of interest or skill in sharing our inner selves with others sometimes adds to the challenge of nurturing our relationships that is posed by professional demands. Opportunities for forming friendships abound in the work setting, if we take the initiative to engage with potential friends. In relationship with others we deepen our identity and discover our potential as persons. Most physicians develop hobbies and interests outside of medicine in the arts, volunteer work, political action, a faith community, sports, or outdoor activities. However, being with friends without developing our capacity for self-disclosure is insufficient. Learning to confide in trusted friends is an essential counterbalance to constantly receiving the confidences of patients in our professional roles. |Long-term intimate partnerships| | | Because of the \"psychology of postponement,\" (2) building, sustaining and benefiting from an enduring relationship with an intimate partner requires enhancing our communication skills, learning to tolerate differences, clarifying values, and negotiating issues such as time, sex, money, and the raising of children. A long-term journey with an intimate partner is a cauldron which both tests our identity and expands our capacity to embrace life and endure its stresses and challenges. An extended love relationship can be a great spiritual path to our growth and development as persons. In such a relationship we can learn acceptance of ourselves with all our flaws and virtues, as well as learn the art of compassion through nurturing our beloved and seeking their well-being. Enhancing our interpersonal communication skills--especially the art of active listening, disclosure of feelings, and negotiating respectfully when there are differences and conflict--is central to an enduring relationship. To build and sustain a loving partnership requires scheduled Quadrant II time. Other key ingredients include awareness of our family of origin influences on intimate communication and expectations; learning to tolerate differences in tastes and preferences; clarifying mutual values as a couple; and negotiating time, sex, money, space, division of labor, and whether and how to raise children. Romance and sex occur spontaneously early on, but will later require intentional planning to create the time and conditions for this vital component of relationship to ripen into a lasting source of mutual renewal. When intimate relationships stagnate or communication patterns do not feel loving and compassionate, couples counseling can be a valuable resource. |Money versus other values| | | Clarifying our relationship to money is essential to realizing our life values in a culture that is enchanted with the accumulation of wealth. Our core philosophy about money, debt and wealth can turn the flow of money through our lives into a burden or a useful tool. Concern about money too often displaces the time required to honor personal values and relationships. Trepidation about paying off educational debts may lead to working longer hours or moonlighting, which diminishes time and energy for family, friends, and hobbies. Sometimes material aspirations lead us to encumber more debt than necessary and we trade Quadrant II time for money, inevitably a dehumanizing exchange. One physician couple who realized they were \"sacrificing precious time and earning money to support a lifestyle not worth living\"( [28](9_0.htm#24)) engaged in value clarification and financial assessment that led to downsizing material possessions, eliminating debt, and embracing a path of \"voluntary simplicity.\"( [29](9_0.htm#25)) Engaging in clarifying life values and financial goals in consultation with a financial planner or through the self-help literature ( [25-27](9_0.htm#21)) can provide a framework for wise decisions about money, income and life. |Additional well-being components| |Spiritual or religious practice, volunteer service and time in nature are known to contribute to personal well-being (30), and we describe some aspects of these parameters in this section.| |WORKPLACE HEALTH AND PERSONAL WELL-BEING| | | Personal commitment is necessary but not sufficient to sustain well-being. Professionals must accept the responsibility of developing model workplaces that support staff well-being. Healthy staff produce better results, such as higher quality, fewer errors and high efficiency, which in turn support the organization. |Workplace challenges to personal well-being| | | Toxic workplace structures and demands challenge our personal commitments. Well-being is not only an individual process, but a political process as well. For our own well-being we might accept the challenge of behavior change, and begin, reinvigorate or enlarge activities that we discussed in the preceding sections, such as any of the following: Unfortunately, these well-intentioned efforts to balance our lives may evaporate at the next staff meeting, where overwork is reinforced and rewarded with admiration, the esteem of colleagues and the imperatives of meeting productivity expectations. Workaholic colleagues are often rewarded with greater influence. Both in school and at work the \"hidden curriculum\" supports unrealistic ideals of tireless physicians always available to others. For the well-being of health professionals to thrive, our workplaces must value the health and well-being of all their workers. Each of us has a responsibility to engage in the difficult work of changing our organizationsmedical schools, residencies, health care systems and practice settingsso that they allow time and energy for the persons who comprise the profession to develop and sustain well-being activities and a sense of professionalism. |Model workplace environments exist| | | Certain groups have successfully accomplished workplace change. Making institutional change is always a collective enterprise, and we will create healthy work environments only to the extent that we collaborate. Some health care organizations have developed work environments and policies that honor the values and health of their clinicians. A group of neonatologists in Oregon developed a flexible system that allows each physician to select the amount and distribution and type of work twice a year. They can reduce workload to pursue non-medical endeavors, or increase it to meet economic needs. They evolved a consensus building and dialogue process to confront the challenges of promoting balanced lives.( [36](9_0.htm#26)) Indiana University School of Medicine is confronting the \"hidden curriculum\" and fostering a social environment that consistently embodies and reinforces values of personal and professional growth, connectedness, passion, and wonder.( [37](9_0.htm#27)) |Healthy workplaces are more likely to be sustainable and profitable| | | Organizational health and physician and worker well-being are mutually reinforcing. Health care organizations that promote the well-being of their employees and staff discover that satisfied workers produce many benefits for the organization. These benefits include, but are not limited to, the following: |The Great Wave of Kanagawa| | | Katsushika painted chaotic waves, sailors collaborating to keep their boats upright, and Mt. Fuij, fully anchored to the earth. The painting might be taken to represent certain elements of personal and organizational well-being that were recognized as important many centuries ago, as they are today. This painting, The Great Wave of Kanagawa, by the artist Hokusai Katsushika, is from a series entitled \"36 Views of Mt. Fuji.\" It captures several of the elements of personal and organizational well-being discussed above. The first and most obvious element is the waves, which are relentlessly chaotic and threaten the balance of the boats. The waves call to mind the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of clinical practice. The second element are the people in the boats, who require cohesion, teamwork, and ongoing communication to keep the boats headed into the waves and moving successfully forward on their journey. A healthy organization provides such a disciplined collaboration for its members, so that no one person bears the sole burden of responsibility. The third element is Mt. Fuji, at first indistinguishable from the waves, which in its deeply grounded stability provides the still point in the center around which the chaos revolves. Mindfulness and self-awareness can provide such a stillness within which we can rest at the deepest center of ourselves as we continue to adjust our balance to catch the next wave. |PLANETARY SUSTAINABILITY AND PERSONAL SUSTAINABILITY| | | Being mindful of factors that promote environmental and planetary health by increasing carrying capacity or decreasing the load from human activity furnishes us insights into the sustainability of our lives and careers. Finally, the health and well-being of our personal lives and of the organizations within which we work is embedded within the health of our planet. Land use planners, when determining where human population growth in a region should be allowed to occur, employ the following equation: C L = M (Capacity Load = Margin). Here capacity refers to the \"carrying capacity\" of the land (available natural resources, transportation corridors, and ability to absorb the wastes of human activity.) Load refers to the impact or \"ecological footprint\" of that human activity upon the land.( [40](9_0.htm#30)) When the carrying capacity of the natural environment is greater than the additional load of human activity, there will be a positive margin and population growth is sustainable. Conversely, when load exceeds capacity, there is a negative margin and growth is unsustainable. On a global scale this same equation applies. This same equation, C L = M, might be applied to our own lives and the organizations within which we work. When our capacity as persons is chronically overloaded by work, family, and other commitments, then we are in a negative margin that is unsustainable, heading for burnout. It is as if we are drawing down the principal of our resources rather than living off the interest. Conversely, when our capacity routinely exceeds the load we assume, then our lives are sustainable.(41) |CONCLUSION| | | Because we are that part of the earth that is conscious of itself, our \"great work\" is to restore the proper relationship of humans with the earth. Our lives of service to patients and colleagues are not sustainable unless we develop attitudes and skills that support our well-being. Because we are health professionals, we should also expand capacity through teamwork and enhancements to the health of our organizations and their workers. Sustaining a life as a professional and as a person in this complex, information-rich and choice-rich era necessitates new skills that were not required of previous generations. However, renewing and balancing our lives entails drawing upon the \"practical wisdom\" of previous generations. This practical wisdom, what Aristotle called phronesis, incorporates the cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal skills to expand our capacity as persons and reduce or eliminate the non-important and unnecessary loads that erode our spirits. Because we work within healthcare systems, we also are compelled to develop a practical wisdom that promotes workplace sustainability, such as expanding our capacity through teamwork, clarifying the organization's values, and establishing structures and processes that enhance the well-being of healthcare workers. Finally, we must awaken to the full context of our lives, knowing that we are that part of the earth that has become conscious of itself. Restoring the proper relationship of humans with the earth in a way that promotes sustainability in the whole system is what Thomas Berry has called \"the great work\" of our generation.( [42](9_0.htm#32)) Developing the practical wisdom to engage in this work in a sustainable way is every physician's personal and collective challenge. |BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST| We hope that you will pause to discern what you could do to foster your own well-being in the coming days, weeks, months and years.

We describe the process of obtaining and communicating a complete history through integration of doctor-centered and patient-centered approaches to obtaining information, and then synthesizing the information into a standard \"write-up\" of the medical history. As you embark on learning and/or improving skills of interviewing, you will find it helpful to review this list of concepts, each of which is discussed later in the text that follows. |Biomedical model and biopsychosocial model| | | With the remarkable ascendance of biotechnology, the practice of medicine is increasingly biomedically oriented. The \"biomedical model\" assumes that disease is related to pathophysiology and can be understood and effectively treated within the realm of biology. George Engel crystallized an alternative way of understanding illness when he articulated the \"biopsychosocial model\". ( This model assumes that human health and illness depends not only on factors in the biological sphere, but also derives from factors in the psychological and social spheres of a patient's life. A disturbance in any sphere can affect the illness process. When you understand how these multiple factors interact in patients' illnesses, you can design and recommend more effective therapies. |Disease and illness, curing and healing| | | Disease implies a disruption in normal biologic function. Disease is objective: you can see disease processes under a microscope and in abnormal laboratory tests. Illness is subjective: people feel a sense of dis-ease; they identify themselves as sick; they behave in different ways than when they are healthy; they seek medical care. A patient can have disease without illness, as in a breast cancer that hasn't yet been discovered; and illness without disease, as in hypochondria. Most patients who seek medical care have both disease and illness, in varying degrees. Some stoic patients can have serious disease but little illness behavior, while other more demonstrative patients may have little biologic disease and be incapacitated. These are important distinctions relevant to daily clinical work, since patients come to clinicians with their illnesses seeking biologic cure, and physicians are eager to find and treat the disease. The distinctions of curing and healing now become clearer: we cure diseases with medications, surgery and biotechnology. We heal illnesses mainly through our words. All clinicians must be able to combine their healing and their curing. |The science and art of medicine| | | Medicine is a scientific discipline, and it depends on other scientific disciplines such as anatomy, physiology and pathology, as well as psychology, sociology and other behavioral sciences. We can understand much of patients' diseases and illnesses through the knowledge and skills we have attained in these disciplines. But medicine is also an art: health outcomes depend on the unique, intimate relationship between clinician and patient. Physicians use themselves as instruments of diagnosis and therapy. Your unique blend of knowledge, skills, attitudes, personal history, emotions and personality will have an effect in your relationships with patients. Your use of yourself in shaping patient care is what comprises your unique contribution to the art of medicine. For that reason, you must care for yourself and seek self-awareness so that you can use yourself wisely to the benefit of your patients. (modules 3, 4) |The goals of medical interviewing| | | You seek to accomplish several goals when you interview a patient. You elicit the information you need to make a diagnosis of a patient's disease. You achieve an understanding of the nature of the patient's illness and how it relates to underlying disease processes. You establish rapport. This rapport engenders trust, which enables patients to reveal critical personal information. A trusting relationship is the foundation for effective patient education and counseling. By the end of an interview, you should have a good idea of the differential diagnosis, a sense of why the patient is ill now as opposed to some other time, and of the attitudinal, social and behavioral factors that contribute to the onset and maintenance of illness. |The Tasks, Functions and Skills of Medical Interviewing| | | Seventy-five to 95 percent of the information needed for physicians to make a correct diagnosis comes from the patient-reported medical history ( Conceptual advances and research findings in recent decades have radically changed our understanding of the medical interview process and the teaching of medical interviewing. A variety of scholars, including contributors to doc.com, have articulated the tasks and functions of medical interviewing, and the skills that enable clinicians to accomplish these tasks. The major functions and tasks that must be accomplished in an effective interview include establishing rapport and building trust, eliciting adequate information, understanding patient concerns, and accomplishing patient education and counseling. Medical students and residents who learn core skills have the ability to conduct thorough interviews in a time-efficient manner ( [6](9_0.htm#6)). A variety of models have been developed that guide students in learning the skills of medical interviewing ( [6-15](9_0.htm#6) [). Also, clinical reasoning can be taught and integrated into interviewing skills to facilitate successful history taking (](9_0.htm#5) [12](9_0.htm#12), [16-18](9_0.htm#16)). Caring for the patient by assuring that you carry out all the functions of the interview is the focus of many modules in doc.com. In this Module, our emphasis is on the structure and content of the information you seek, although we emphasize that how you get the information helps or hinders the building of relationships and prepares the ground for patient education. Experienced clinicians understand the distinction between the tasks or functions they wish to accomplish during the interview, and the structure of the written history that they will assemble after the interview. Learners who master core skills through practice, reflection and feedback are able to use the skills flexibly to accomplish the tasks of interviewing. In modules 6 12, doc.com authors present and elaborate the tasks and skills agreed on by the Kalamazoo Consensus panel. This group of scholars, including advocates and designers of the various models of interviewing, was able to agree on names and descriptions for 7 essential skills, tasks and functions of medical interviewing; namely, building a relationship with patients, opening the discussion, gathering information, understanding the patient's perspective, sharing information, reaching agreement, and closing the interview. |Interviewing skills matter| | | Review these two four minute video clips. Notice that the physician's approach in each determines the quantity and quality of information gathered. |Click on the picture-button above to see Movie ONE||Click on the picture-button above to see Movie TWO| | | What are the components of each approach that were effective and ineffective in eliciting the patient's story? |Doctor-Centered and Patient-Centered Approaches to Interviewing| Historically, most physicians conducted \"doctor-centered\" interviews. That is, they took charge of the interaction to acquire specific details of the patient's story, in order to diagnose a disease. Most of the questions were guided by the doctors' clinical reasoning, and their need to elicit certain information to choose among various hypotheses about disease states. However, doctor-centered interviewing often ignored important personal data and lacked the personal and affective content necessary to establish a trusting relationship and understand the patient's illness experience. Relationship has always been paramount, but establishing trust became increasingly difficult as biotechnical aspects of disease increased, diagnostic tests became more complex and invasive, specialists emerged, and physician-patient encounters were more often between complete strangers. Engel and others started teaching another style of interviewing: the \"patient-centered\" interview. In this style, the focus is primarily on understanding the patient's story, allowing the patient to do most of the work, with the physician being guided by what patients were trying to reveal about the nature of their illness and life. Evidence supports the contention that you will obtain the most accurate and complete biopsychosocial story by integrating patient-centered interviewing with doctor-centered interviewing. However, whether you are using doctor-centered or patient-centered techniques, your dialog is persistently focused on understanding the patient's story so that you achieve a full understanding of the patient's illness. The skills and techniques of \"patient-centered\" and \"doctor-centered\" interviewing overlap and are not entirely unique to one style or the other. We present them sequentially below for clarity, but experienced clinicians move back and forth quite flexibly, as called for by the details of a particular encounter with a particular person with particular problems. For example, different skills may be required when encountering patients who tell complete stories in linear sequence, situations that are very urgent, or diseases and illnesses which differ greatly in complexity and severity. Because the medical interview is one of our most complex, intensely personal and potentially invasive procedures, it requires sensitivity, delicacy and a full understanding of skills and strategies, like coronary artery bypass surgery and other procedures we perform. The learning process is complicated, dependent on your personality, attitudes and unique gifts, and the learning continues throughout your professional career, as your experience with disease, illness and patients' lives expands and broadens. In this module we present ideas about sequencing, timing and chronology that clinically inexperienced learners will find useful for getting started, and more experienced learners will identify new aspects for more intensive study. We could say that you are learning the notes and chords and rhythms of music, so that you can actually make music sooner rather than later. The \"old way,\" to paraphrase Engel, was to \"send students off with a piano for a time and tell them to come back and say what they had discovered about music.\" We can do better, thanks to the work of scholars who have studied the interview and the learning process. This module is an overview, and the specific skills involved in performing an interview are discussed in more detail in subsequent modules. We expect your study and/or review of the concepts in this module will prepare you well for the complexities and uncertainties you will encounter as your career in medicine develops. |PATIENT-CENTERED INTERVIEWING SKILLS| | | We divide the process of patient-centered interviewing into 5 steps and 21 sub-steps to enhance learning.( Always integrated with doctor-centered interviewing (steps 6-10), the 5 patient-centered steps focus on the patient: his or her interests, concerns, and questions as well as physical symptoms. The doctor-centered portion occurs next and pins down biopsychosocial details that do not arise during patient-centered interviewing, especially the details needed to diagnose and treat disease. As patients tell their stories during this initial patient-centered phase, hold your own questions about possible disease diagnoses until the doctor-centered phase, which usually will be no more than a few minutes later. Many terms in the Steps below require further explanation, which you will find in subsequent text or other doc.com modules. It is normal to be a bit overwhelmed as you initially encounter the complexity of patient-centered interviewing. We identify and describe 21 discrete skills, which are easily learned in 2-3 teaching sessions. Physicians use these skills hundreds of times a day, and the skills will soon become reflexive for you as well. While full mastery of patient-centered interviewing usually requires more learning time than the more \"rote\" doctor-centered list of questions, good patient-centered interviewing saves time and produces a more robust picture of the problems at hand. In this section you'll find in-depth information about: |Step 1: Set the stage for the interview| |(30 to 60 seconds)| Bolded statements are the specific sub-steps. |Step 2: Obtain the patient's agenda; including the chief |(30 to 60 seconds, see doc.com module 7)| |Step 3: Open the History of Present Illness (HPI)| |(30 60 seconds, see doc.com module 8)| |Step to obtain the HPI| |(5 10 minutes)| |Step 5: Transition to the Doctor-Centered portion of the interview| Patient-centered interviewing is used in virtually all situations, from the new patient to the return visit, from the emergency room to the consultation, and from surgery to obstetrics. Rarely, however, one does not employ patient-centered inquiry: 1) if the patient's condition is so critical and urgent that spending a couple minutes this way would be dangerous; 2) if it makes the patient uncomfortable, especially in adolescents and children; 3) if the patient is not mentally competent. Therefore, we can expect to employ patient-centered interviewing in nearly all situations. We now describe the doctor-centered interviewing process that follows. |DOCTOR-CENTERED INTERVIEWING SKILLS| |The doctor-centered portion of the interview focuses on testing clinical hypotheses and expands the data base of patient information.| What you have obtained through patient-centered interviewing constitutes the initial part of the patient's story, and comprises most of the \"history of present illness\" (HPI). Patient-centered data, however, rarely complete the story. You need more details to make diagnoses of disease and fill in the database; e.g., the family history and social history. The doctor-centered part of the interview differs from the patient-centered part because in it you ask about symptom information not yet mentioned by the patient (details of symptoms already mentioned and new symptoms not yet mentioned) in order to complete the HPI. You also explore other aspects of the patient's life and history to discover other diseases outside the HPI, assess for disease risk, and come to know the patient better on a personal level. One way to conceptualize this process is to understand that in patient-centered segments of interviews, clinicians provide patients with prompts, and then listen intently to whatever the patient offers about symptoms, timing and other details, feelings, connections, background and so on. In doctor-centered segments, clinicians seek answers to specific questions they have, based both on hypotheses they generate from listening carefully to patients' stories, and on the need for \"routine\" background information that experience has shown may provide additional clues (\"with whom do you live; do you drink alcohol, are you having sex,\" and so on.) ( [19](9_0.htm#19)) In this section you'll find in-depth information about: |Step 6: Completion of the HPI| The first task of the doctor-centered component of the HPI is to expand the description of symptoms and obtain details not yet introduced by the patient (e.g., medications, hospitals, doctors) ( [19](9_0.htm#19)). | | Table 1: Filling in the history of present illness The following topics are covered further in this sub-section: |Expand descriptions of symptom(s) already mentioned by the patient| | | To fully understand a symptom, you need to know its seven \"cardinal features\". ( In the patient-centered interview, patients tell you many of a symptom's features, but even the most articulate patients are unlikely to mention all possible features when telling their story. Therefore, in the doctor-centered portion of the interview, seek additional details. Start with an open-ended request (\"Tell me more about what your chest pain is like\"), and then ask more specific closed-ended questions to elicit all the cardinal features (\"You pointed to the left side of your chest; does the pain travel anywhere?\"). For non-pain symptoms such as weakness or dizziness, not all cardinal features apply (e.g., location, radiation). (module 8) The precise location of a symptom and whether it radiates are diagnostically important (e.g., substernal chest pain radiating down the left arm suggests angina pectoris or myocardial infarction). The quality of a symptom is telling. For example, substernal chest pain that is burning is more likely to be due to esophageal reflux, while squeezing or crushing chest pain is more likely to be cardiac. Patients sometimes describe their symptoms in odd ways, e.g., \"It feels like someone is reaching inside me and tearing me apart.\" Such language may hint at psychological problems, although it may simply emanate from someone who likes colorful language or metaphor. Use a numeric rating scale to quantify pain, \"On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no pain and 10 being the worst you can imagine, what number would you give this pain you're describing?\" Chronology provides important clues to the nature of disease and illness, and coherence to patients' stories: the primary problem, when it began, its course to the present, and its previous treatment. Fill in all relevant data to understand the big picture -- the patient's interacting biologic, psychological (personal, emotional), and social dimensions. Organize all features to fit within the chronology. | | Table 2. The 7 cardinal features of symptoms (Modified from Smith RC. Patient centered interviewing. 2nd ed. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins; 2002.) |Inquire about symptoms not yet introduced that occur in the same body system| After eliciting a complete picture of the patient's symptom story, ask about other symptoms in the same body system as the one described in the HPI. In essence, do a focused \"review of systems\" (ROS) of that one body system. Determine not only which other symptoms are present but also which ones are absent; for example, the absence of dyspnea (shortness of breath on exertion) in a patient with chest pain weighs against a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. |Ask about relevant symptoms outside the body system involved in the HPI| Next, ask about symptoms outside the involved body system if they are pertinent to a diagnosis you are considering. For example, in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis who is feeling fatigued, asking about gastrointestinal bleeding symptoms (\"any black stools?\"). Bleeding is not a joint or musculoskeletal symptom, but is relevant if you suspect gastrointestinal bleeding caused by drug therapy that irritates the stomach. In patients with more than one problem, you will need to inquire about multiple systems in the HPI. |Elicit the presence or absence of relevant non-symptom data (secondary data) not yet introduced by the patient| Elicit any information concerning medications taken, treatments received, doctor visits and hospitalizations, and diagnoses given. Also, asking questions about possible causes for the diagnoses being entertained may help narrow the differential diagnosis. For example, if pulmonary embolism is a concern, ask about recent long car rides or air travel. |Scanning without interpretation versus hypothesis-testing| When you first learn medical interviewing you will seldom know what diseases might be causing a patient's symptoms. By using the patient-centered and doctor-centered approach, you will gather sufficient data to guide your search of texts and other resources to discover likely diagnoses. Early on you must be exhaustive in your interviewing because you are not generating diagnostic hypotheses or interpreting the patient's responses in real-time to guide your further questioning.( [2](9_0.htm#2), [5](9_0.htm#5)) You may need to return to the patient with additional questions after reading about the problem and developing new hypotheses about what is causing the symptoms. As your medical knowledge and interviewing experience increase, however, you will begin to have ideas or \"hunches\" about what might be causing a patient's symptoms. You can then ask specific questions to test these hypotheses.( [19](9_0.htm#19), [21](9_0.htm#21)) For example, a patient with sudden shortness of breath and chest pain following a long car ride might prompt consideration of pulmonary embolism. To test this hypothesis, ask about hemoptysis (coughing up blood), leg pain, whether the chest pain is worse when taking a deep breath (pleuritic in quality), and if there is a prior history of deep venous thrombosis. With time and practice, knowledge and skills develop sufficiently to allow reliance upon the hypothesis-driven approach, although never completely abandoning the scanning approach. |Becoming patient-centered when appropriate| To provide the most compassionate, effective and efficient service for your patients, you will utilize your patient-centered emotion response skills to express caring and empathy whenever the patient expresses emotion. When patients express emotion, your relationship with them will improve if you respond in real time. You lose trust and erode confidence if you do not respond. When ill, we are all especially vulnerable, and need our care-givers to show us that they are aware of our plight, and especially of our humanness. If our expression of emotion is not acknowledged, it seems as though it fell on deaf ears, and that the listener cares more about something else (the symptom, the lab test, our allergies, or our stomach) than about the vulnerable human being in front of them. Further, when patients experience more trust and hear your acknowledgement of their feelings, they tend to expand what they have been saying, to trust you with secrets that may be very important clues to both diagnosis and treatment, and to help you as much as they can. Although you may be the best cardiologist in your area, if the patient is not experiencing increasing confidence that you care about him or her as much as you care about the heart, they will \"shut down\" and cooperate less willingly and fully. Some will even \"punish you\" (usually unconsciously), withhold information and make your job much harder than it needs to be. For example, if during the Family History the patient becomes tearful and indicates sadness about her father's death (whether it happened last week or 10 years ago), a compassionate response from you, such as \"I see that thinking about your father makes you very sad\" will be helpful. You will likely learn more about this event and its potential contribution to the present problems, and also firm up your relationship with the patient through your communication of your attempt to better understand her situation. |Step 7: Past Medical History| | | Although you may have a reasonable picture now that you have obtained relevant details of the HPI, you still need ancillary data to complete the picture. Some data will be related directly to the HPI (e.g., a recent myocardial infarction will be germane in a patient with bloody stools if he requires major surgery). Other \"routine\" or ancillary data will not immediately relate to the HPI but is still important (e.g., exercise habits, education, intimate partners, and family history of tuberculosis). The approach to the remainder of the history is similar to the doctor-centered part of the HPI. Questioning should usually begin in an open-ended fashion in each major area and then be followed by closed-ended questions to obtain details, always remembering to return to the patient-centered skills, and to be aware of the patient's emotions as you go along. You will obtain specific ancillary data in the Past Medical History ( [Table 3](#1)). Start with open-ended questions (e.g., \"Can you tell me about your other medical problems?\") and then focus as needed with closed-ended questions to establish details (e.g., \"How long have you had high blood pressure?\" \"What medicines are you taking for it?\"). For chronic illnesses, include the duration of illness or diagnosis date along with current management and level of symptom control, related complications and any recent objective measures of disease activity (eg Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, diagnosed 12 yrs ago, controlled with daily oral medications, only known complication is mild renal insufficiency, hemoglobin A1C one month ago 7.2) [Table 3](#1) shows a list of all past history components. Medications Determine the medications the patient takes, including both dosage and administration (by mouth, vaginally, topical, etc). Ask about over-the-counter medications and herbal, complementary or alternative remedies. Ask specifically about birth control pills, hormones, laxatives, and vitamins, as some patients do not consider these to be medications. Allergies Ask about environmental, food, and medication allergies. Determine exactly what reaction the patient had to a medication, since many medication \"allergies\" reported by patients are actually expected side effects (e.g., itching with morphine) or non-allergic adverse reactions (e.g., gastric bleeding from aspirin). | | |Step 8: Family History (FH)| | | Ask about the age and health of the patient's immediate family as well as the causes of death, when they died, and ages of first-degree relatives. Information from the FH frequently gives you clues about the patient's concerns. For example, a patient presents with chest pain, and you learn that his brother died a year earlier from a heart attack. Or the patient is 50 years old and you learn that her mother died at age 51 from breast cancer. Screen for genetic and environmental illnesses by inquiring about a family history of diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, tuberculosis, alcoholism, and asthma. | | Table 4: Family history |Step 9: Psychosocial History| | | The psychosocial history describes behaviors and other personal factors that may impact disease and illness risk, severity and outcome; it also helps you to get to know the patient. The psychosocial history complements the personal and emotional information obtained in the patient-centered portion of the interview. As you gain experience, you learn which questions are most important to ask for a particular patient encounter. Some highlighted items in [Table 5](6_50.htm) will identify targets for risk factor modification, and are infrequently spontaneously brought up by patients. They need open and non-judgmental discussion, which builds trust and relationship, and assures the most accurate information. You may need to obtain this type of information over multiple patient encounters. Some of the most important areas of the Psychosocial History are detailed below in this section: |Habits| Ask about tobacco use, including forms of tobacco (e.g., pipe, snuff, chewing tobacco) and number of pack-years for cigarette use. (A pack-year is one pack of cigarettes per day for a year. If a patient smoked 2 packs of cigarettes per day for 10 years, you would say the patient was a 20 pack-year smoker.) Determine whether the patient consumes alcohol and whether it may be a health problem. Ask \"Do you drink alcohol\", and follow up a \"yes\" answer with the \"CAGE\" questions: \"Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?\" \"Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking?\" \"Have you ever feld bad or guilty about your drinking?\" \"Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover?\" (eye-opener) (For a full discussion of screening for alcoholism, see module 29.) Ask about the patient's use of drugs: \"Have you used marijauna, street drugs, or prescription drugs to have fun or get high in the last year?\" If yes, then ask, \"have you felt you wanted or needed to cut down on your use of this/ those drugs in the last year?\" |Personal issues| Occupation A patient's occupation can affect health.( [22](9_0.htm#22)) Ask, \"What kind of work do you do? What other jobs have you had? Have you ever been exposed to fumes, dust, radiation, or loud noise at work? Do you think your work is affecting your symptoms now?\" If the patient does not work outside the home, ask what a typical day is like. Stress Most patients have stress in their lives, which may contribute substantially to the onset and maintenance of their symptoms. A simple question often elicits an important story: \"Tell me about the stress in your life\" \"Is life stressful these days?\" Mood Depressive and anxiety disorders each occur in 11-12 % of people, and up to 50% of depressive disorders are missed in primary care. Simple questions will guide you in whether to seek further details to establish the presence of an important disorder. \"So- how are your spirits these days?\" \"Are you getting any pleasure in life?\" \"How is your sleep?\" Home Life A good way to inquire about home life is to ask, \"Does anyone else live at home with you? Tell me about him or her.\" \"How do you get along?\" Sexuality Asking about a patient's spouse or significant other should provide a comfortable segue into asking about sexuality.( [23](9_0.htm#23)) Do not assume a patient's sexual orientation or sexuality. Gender-neutral language (e.g., \"partner\") communicates to gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender patients that it is safe for them to be honest and open with you. You can elicit basic important information with the questions shown below. Many situations will require that you ask more details, such as the questions below: Some patients and some clinicians are bothered by these questions, and we explore the issues in more detail in module 18. |Domestic Partner Violence| Domestic violence occurs in as many as 1 of every 4 US families. Both because this is so frequent, and because patients are unlikely to broach this issue themselves, clinicians must sensitively inquire about domestic partner violence. One suggested approach ( [24](9_0.htm#24)) is \"Have you ever been hit, slapped, kicked, or otherwise physically hurt by someone? Has anyone ever forced you to have sexual activities?\" (We will explore more about this in module 28) |Spirituality and Religious Beliefs| Spirituality and religious beliefs are important to many patients, especially in times of illness. The following questions will get you started ( [25](9_0.htm#25)): \"Do you consider yourself to be a spiritual or religious person?\" \"What importance does faith have in your life?\" \"Are you a part of a spiritual or religious community?\" (We explore this issue in more detail in Module 19.) |Psychosocial history| | | Table 5: Psychosocial history Items in bold should be asked about in most new patient encounters: they have high yield for risk factor modification, assist in building the doctor-patient relationship, and/or are important to patients but rarely brought up by them |Step 10: Review of Systems| The review of systems (ROS) is a head-to-toe survey to uncover symptoms not elicited earlier in the interview. You already performed part of the ROS while filling in the HPI. Now, survey the remaining body systems to ensure that the database is complete (Table 6). From data gathered in the HPI and past medical history you will already have a reasonable idea about the major diagnostic possibilities. The ROS is not used to elucidate key features of the present illness.( [19](9_0.htm#19)) Rather, it is used to screen for any additional symptoms unrelated to the HPI (e.g., abnormal rectal bleeding in a patient with suspected pneumonia). As you gain experience, you will settle on a few questions from each system which you routinely use, and you will become proficient and efficient at asking them. You cannot ask about every possible symptom, so you will select some that help you cover important bases. Most importantly the direct and attentive way that you ask these \"routine\" questions signals to patients both your biomedical competence, and your invitation to listen about any symptom, illness or issue that might be relevant. The ROS completes your interview. After completing the interview you will usually begin examining the patient. Some clinicians, in the interest of saving time, will ask ROS questions as they are going through relevant segments of the physical exam. Table 6 below lists all review of systems components: | | Table 6: Review of systems. |RECORDING THE PATIENT'S HISTORY: THE MEDICAL HISTORY WRITE-UP| | | The written description of patient information in the medical record is called the medical 'write-up.' It usually contains the patient's history, physical examination, initial diagnostic tests, problem list, assessment, and plans for further investigations and treatment. We will focus here only on the write-up of the patient's history. A well-organized write-up synthesizes information from different parts of the interview. We suggest the following format for recording the data: Identifying Data This information includes the patient's age, gender, race, medical record number, telephone number of nearest relative in case of emergency and referral source, if any. Source and Reliability of Information State the source of the data (e.g., patient, parent) and their reliability, noting any concerns you might have. This signals the quality of the data to the reader. Chief Complaint and Agenda State the patient's most bothersome symptom (known as the chief complaint or chief concern) using his or her words if possible and then summarize the full, negotiated agenda from Step 2 with a list. History of Present Illness The HPI is the most important part of the history and is usually written in narrative form. In the beginning, you may simply record the chronology of symptoms as the patient reports them. As you gain more understanding about disease patterns and experience you should record the information in a way that will lead students and physicians to the same diagnostic conclusions you are considering. Begin the section with an overview of the chief concern and other symptoms (primary data) that fit together to best describe the most likely underlying disease process. Indicate when each began and provide their pertinent cardinal features. Then record the absence of relevant symptoms. In determining which symptoms are relevant, a beginning student may only consider other symptoms in the same body system as the chief complaint. As you develop a better understanding of disease, you should also include symptoms from other body systems. For example a beginning student may record the presence or absence of symptoms only in the Musculoskeletal and General System in a patient with arthritis who complains of fatigue, but an advanced student may also record the absence of gastrointestinal bleeding in the patient who is at risk because of arthritis medication. Next, record the relevant positive and negative non-symptom (secondary) data, such as data about previous doctors and healthcare facilities, diagnostic tests and results, treatments and results, specific habits, and occupation that are important for understanding the etiology (cause), pathogenesis (mechanism) and prognosis of the patient's problem. Finally, record the synthesized personal data obtained from both the patient-centered and doctor-centered process to display your understanding of how the patient's personal and emotional dimensions are linked with his or her physical problem. Sometimes this link is clearly causal, but even when it is not, we can describe a personal context of the physical problem in all patients. Other Current Active Problems (OCAP) This section contains other active problems that are unrelated the patient's HPI. As with the HPI, these problems should be described with the appropriate primary and secondary data. The remainder of the write-up (Past Medical History, Psychosocial History, Family History, Review of Systems, Physical Exam, Laboratory Tests, Assessment, Problem List and Plan) can be recorded in an outline form or combination of narrative and outline form using the information obtained from the remainder of the doctor-centered process. Problem List The problem list is a numbered listing of all active problems (e.g. chest pain, diabetes), past problems (e.g. s/p cholecystectomy 1998) and future risk of problems (e.g. family history colon cancer). Every comprehensive write-up requires a complete problem list. Every problem or disease identified within the evaluation, from HPI to ROS, is included in the problem list. In addition, unexpected abnormal findings found on physical examination or laboratory testing are also listed in the problem list. |CONCLUSION| Integrating patient-centered interviewing with doctor-centered interviewing results in the most complete, accurate and diagnostically powerful dataset the patient's biopsychosocial story. As well, by interviewing in this way, you build a strong doctor-patient relationship that will be important as you negotiate further testing and therapy for the patient's illness. The relationship itself is also therapeutic for the patient and will improve your professional satisfaction. |TABLES| | | This section includes all the tables used in this module for further reference. |Table 1: Filling in the history of present illness.| | | |Table 2: The 7 cardinal features of symptoms| | | (Modified from Smith RC.

Mosby, St Louis, 2000. | | Authors: | | 2.0 - 07/13/2009 - update to doc.com V4.0 1.1 - 08/17/2005 1.0 - 07/24/2005 |Rationale| | | by Julian Bird, MD A positive doctor-patient relationship is the key to medical care. Substantial evidence indicates that a relationship of trust and respect promotes better adherence to treatment recommendations, better physical and emotional outcomes, the disclosure of patients' hidden concerns, and furthermore, that the absence of a good relationship is an impairment to high quality medical care. The physician-patient relationship stands as the cornerstone of clinical medicine. The first essential element of the interview, Build the Relationship, utilizes a set of emotional response skills which are among the most important communication skills the physician can develop. Patients expect their doctors to be knowledgeable and technically competent. But they also want their doctors to be reassuring, supportive, and emotionally available. Physicians with effective relationship skills will have more satisfied patients who will better adhere to treatment recommendations. Furthermore, the physician with effective relationship skills will cope with emotionally troubling situations better and will, in general, find the clinical practice of medicine more enjoyable. Such a physician will be able to give more emotionally to patients and will, in turn, get more satisfying responses from them. There is a substantial body of evidence about the importance of physician patient relationships in outcomes of care. For example, in a study of over 7000 patients, physicians' comprehensive (\"whole person\") knowledge of patients and patients' trust in their physician were the variables most strongly associated with adherence, and trust was the variable most strongly associated with patients' satisfaction with their physician. (1) You can achieve a \"whole person\" knowledge of patients by building supportive, caring relationships. In a meta-analysis of studies on the relationships of physician communication and outcomes of care, physicians' providing positive affect, empathy and support emerged as an important factor in promoting positive patient outcomes. This study found that when physicians ask about patients' understanding, concerns, expectations, and impact of illness on function, it leads to decreased anxiety and promotes symptom resolution. Physicians asking about patients' feelings leads to decreased patient distress, and when physicians provide support and empathy, there is both decreased patient distress and better symptom resolution. In studies of medical outcomes, when patients feel that they have been able to express themselves fully (feelings, opinions, information), they later have improved health and functional status, and better BP control. Moreover, when patients feel there has been a full discussion of their problems, they experience better symptom resolution. (2) |RELATIONSHIP SKILLS| | | This module describes a group of basic relationship skills that help build doctor-patient rapport. Once you learn these skills, you can integrate them into your natural style of relating. This integration provides the foundation for you to master higher-order skills for continued relationship-building, for helping patients cope better with emotional distress, and for properly managing complex and complicated situations. These include working with dying patients or those with alcohol problems or those with the most severe illnesses such as major trauma or leukemia, communicating bad news, and helping angry patients manage- to name just a few such situations. |Attentiveness and Warmth| | | Attentiveness to the patient as a person is the prerequisite of all relationship building. Not only does the demonstration of warm attentiveness in itself create a positive impact but also all the other components of relationship building depend on attentiveness. If you do not constantly pay attention to the person as well as to diagnosis and management you will fail to spot the appropriate moments for demonstrating empathy, respect, support and partnership. Attentiveness is demonstrated by both non-verbal and verbal behaviors. Non-verbal behavior and 'para-verbal' behavior (tone and pacing of speech) are the most powerful determinants of the emotional impact of any interaction. Warmth and attentiveness are demonstrated through eye contact, voice tone, nods and uh-huh's, responsive facial expression and forward posture. Attentive silence can have a powerful positive impact and is considered in more detail in this module's section on empathy. A more detailed overview of non-verbal behavior appears in module 14. You should strive for consistency between your verbal and nonverbal behavior. For example, if there is a disjunction between your verbal statements of concern and your nonverbal behavior, which may reflect your disapproval of a patient's behavior, your nonverbal message will usually prevail for the patient. (3) An emerging body of research supports these contentions. Doctors who establish appropriate eye contact are more likely to detect emotional distress in their patients. Doctors who perform better on tests of nonverbal sensitivity have patients who are more satisfied. Doctors who lean forward and have a forward head lean and open body posture also have more satisfied patients. (4) In addition, patients' nonverbal behaviors are keys to their emotional lives. Most patients express their emotional state through facial expression, body posture, movement, tone of voice, inflection, and physical manifestations of autonomic nervous system reactivity (sweaty palms, flushed face, etc.). Physicians interested in understanding their patients' emotional states will look for these signs and consider their importance at every stage of the communication process. In general, you should establish and keep comfortable eye contact with the patient throughout the interview. This is essential for active and effective listening and also to be able to observe emotional cues as they arise. As with all rules, there are exceptions: angry, suspicious, and/or paranoid patients can perceive steady eye contact as provocative. Thoughtful attention to the use of space also facilitates rapport. Vertical space between doctor and patient should be minimized (e.g., not standing while the patient sits) and horizontal space should be carefully planned (e.g., not too close or too far). The power of the various relationship building skills you will master, and the intimacy and social power differentials that accompany caring for people who are ill and vulnerable require you to be especially mindful of appropriate boundaries in your doctor patient relationships. Doctors' skills repertoire needs to include respectful ways of reinforcing those boundaries if and when the need arises. (module 41) Verbal demonstration of attentiveness is largely through 'active listening' (described in more detail in module 8, \"Gather Information\"). Active listening includes 'continuers' (encouraging comments) such as 'please tell me more' and reflection (repetition) of key phrases used by the patient (\"I see ...the pain was severe\"). Expression of your own emotional response to the patient's experience (e.g., \"my goodness .. how awful\") can also be a powerful way to indicate attentiveness. However, your expressions of emotion must be titrated so that they do not burden or distract the patient. |Empathy| | | Empathy is a term indicating one person's appreciation, understanding, and acceptance of someone else's emotional situation, inner experience and perspectives. When a physician communicates this understanding, the patient feels heard, understood and accepted, and that the physician has tried to \"walk a mile in my shoes\" The communication of empathy is one of the most helpful, meaningful, and comforting interventions one person can have with someone else. A parent soothes an upset child by letting the child know that the distress is understood, appreciated, and accepted. Friends can do the same. Similarly, a physician can build rapport and respond to patients' emotions best by the communication of empathy. (5) Sometimes physicians are reluctant to encourage the patient to express feelings more deeply by expressing empathy. They may feel that this will open a \"Pandora's box\" of emotions or that empathic comments will \"push\" patients to express feelings that they might otherwise wish to keep private. Research suggests though, that it is helpful and supportive to allow patients some opportunities for the ventilation of feelings that are near the \"surface\" of awareness. Such interventions help develop rapport and trust. And contrary to the worry that expressions of empathy can unnecessarily prolong the interview, there is evidence that a little empathy goes a long way (6), and can make your interactions with patients more efficient. The communication of an empathic understanding of a patient's predicament is clearly the most important relationship-building skill the physician can possess. There are many different ways to communicate empathy effectively. The challenge of learning empathic skills lies in the ability to master basic interventions and to integrate these into a natural interpersonal style that feels genuine to you and, as such, is likely to be perceived as genuine by the patient. Nonverbal behaviors can sometimes communicate empathy more effectively than can concrete statements. A sympathetic look, attentive silence, and a hand on the shoulder can all accomplish a great deal towards letting the patient know you are emotionally in tune with the patient's distress. Genuine interest in the patient's life, feelings, worries, expectations and hopes communicate empathy. Most students and physicians already possess natural empathic abilities, but the challenges of medical practice often require the development of additional skills. Physicians need to ask patients about very personal issues, and patients will often tell their physicians things they tell no one else, such as sexual problems or stories of physical and sexual abuse. It takes learning specific skills, practice and experience to become comfortable eliciting and listening to patients' most personal concerns. A word on attentive silence: It is a valuable skill: it wordlessly communicates concern, interest and respect. It counters the impressions many patients hold that \"doctors don't listen to their patients.\" It gives patients an opening to discuss their most troubling issues. When a patient interrupts a narrative and falls silent, or expresses a strong emotion, it is wise to remain silent. If the silence lasts more than about 5 seconds, you can gently say, \"what are you feeling?\" or \"are you able to talk about it?\" Most beginning learners have great difficulty with attentive silence, often feeling the need to change the subject or reassure the patient. But attentive silence has many rewards for patient and physician |Click on the picture-button on the left to experience the nonverbal skill of attentive silence.| This chapter describes two operational components of empathic communication, \"reflection\" and \"legitimation,\" that can be used to facilitate your responses to patients' emotional distress. Reflection refers to your description of the emotion experienced by the patient and legitimation refers to the physician's confirmation that the emotion is understood and accepted. |Empathy: Reflection| | | Reflection is a fundamental relationship skill used in everyday encounters between friends and family members. The power of reflection is emphasized in the writings of Carl Rogers and other authors. Here, reflection refers to a physician's acknowledgement of an observed feeling or emotion in a patient. (7) If you notice that a patient begins to look sad when discussing the illness of a parent, examples of ways you can \"reflect\" this feeling include the following: |Physician:|| | You look sad right now. or I can see this is upsetting to you. or This is hard to talk about. This type of reflective comment usually helps you communicate empathic concern for the patient's emotional situation. In practical terms, such comments usually give patients permission to talk more about their feelings. Patients often then go on to reveal important information that helps you better understand their illnesses. |Click on the picture-button on the left to see an example of reflection.| The specific words you use are much less important than the fact that you have interrupted the factual exchange of information to notice and respond to the patient's emotional state. This is a critically important event in the building of a relationship with a patient and demonstrates to the patient that you are concerned about the patient as a person and his or her emotional experiences. When you make reflective comments about sadness, patients will often begin to cry, which can make you uncomfortable, and want to either \"fix\" the problem, reassure the patient, or change the topic. However, a patient's crying is a good sign it indicates that the patient trusts you. Also, crying in the presence of a caring physician is often therapeutic for patients. It is best to respond to patients' tears with attentive silence, and offering a tissue. After you make reflective comments, patients may indicate that they do not wish to discuss their emotional reactions, and you should of course respect these desires. It is important however, that you do not confuse your own discomfort or desire to avoid emotional issues with the inference that it is the patient who wishes to avoid these topics. Sometimes, patients are reluctant to talk about difficult emotional issues because of guilt or shame (8), or their worry that you will not be open to listening, or might be judgmental. Often, a comment such as, \"it's pretty hard to talk about this \" followed by attentive silence, will reassure the patient and enable them to disclose their feelings. On the other hand, if you do not acknowledge a patient's manifest feelings, the patient will feel less understood and unconfirmed. Such feelings undermine doctor-patient rapport and actually interfere with collection of data. One of the cardinal rules of good interviewing is the following: | | Respond to a patient's feeling as soon as it appears Remember that reflective comments can be utilized several times as a patient discusses and experiences feelings. One reflective comment may be insufficient. In fact, as a patient expresses emotional reactions, the specific feeling expressed may change in quality and degree. For example, a patient who seems sad at first may eventually express anger or frustration or vice versa. If the physician listens carefully, the initial feeling can be acknowledged and subsequent ones reflected as they emerge. Such attention to patients' feelings seldom requires excessive time, and may contribute to efficient interviews by removing emotional obstacles to full disclosure of symptoms and circumstances. Physicians trained in responding to patients' feelings can have profound effects in relieving emotional distress without lengthening the medical visits. (9) If the emotional issues become too complex to address in the interview time available, you can acknowledge the significance of the feelings and make arrangements to deal with the emotional issues at a later, but acceptable date. Alternately, a suitable other approach, e.g., a psychiatric, psychological, or social work referral, could be arranged. |Empathy: Legitimation| | | Legitimation, or validation, is closely related to reflection but specifically communicates acceptance of the patient's emotional experience and respect for it. After you have carefully listened to a patient's discussion of an emotional situation, you can then let the patient know that the feelings are understandable and make sense. Examples of validating comments would be: |Physician:|| | \"I can certainly understand why you'd be upset under the circumstances.\" or \"Anyone would find this very difficult.\" or \"Your reactions are perfectly normal.\" or \"This would be anxiety provoking for anyone.\" or \"I can understand why you're so angry.\" |Click on the picture-button on the left to see an example of legitimation.| With respect to validating the feelings of someone who is angry, making a legitimizing statement does not mean that you agree with the reasons for the anger. The point is that you are trying to understand this anger from the patient's point of view. Once you have understood the anger, you can communicate this understanding to the patient. This is sometimes difficult to do if you disagree with or feel irritated or threatened by an angry patient. Nevertheless, reflective and validating comments can play the same helpful role with angry patients as they do with sad or anxious patients. For example, if the patient is angry because he or she has been waiting too long, you might say: |Physician:|| | \"I can see that you are frustrated because you've been waiting so long. I understand why you are angry. I apologize for that.\" These principles are highlighted again in module 13. |Respect| | | Attentive listening, nonverbal signals, eye contact, and genuine concern show that you respect your patient and his or her problems. Making explicit respectful comments further builds rapport, improves the relationship, and helps the patient cope with difficult situations. For the purposes of this text, an intervention communicating respect refers to a specific endorsement for a specific patient behavior. Statements of respect which validate patient behaviors will, in general, tend to reinforce the behavior, i.e. make it more likely to happen again. Frequent demonstrations of respect will foster a positive relationship and promote the patients' capacity for coping. |Click on the picture-button on the left to see an example of respect.| Physicians can usually find something to praise in all their patients. Most everyone does something well. This holds true even for patients with troubling or difficult behaviors (cf. module 13). Doctors can help their patients by focusing on one or more of their patient's successful coping skills. This will improve patient satisfaction and adherence. Examples of respectful statements would be: |Physician:|| | \"I'm impressed by how well you're coping.\" or \"Despite this chronic pain, you're still able to carry on at home and at work. That is quite an accomplishment.\" Like all the other interventions discussed above, statements of respect must be honest, or they will be more destructive than helpful. When these sentiments reflect true feelings of the physician, however, they are powerful facilitators of improved communication and rapport between doctors and patients. Comment for medical students and residents: Depending on your level of training, you may be aware of a \"hidden curriculum\"- what you learn about attitudes and behaviors toward patients from other residents and attending physicians. Some residents and attendings may call patients names such as \"gomers\" or \"crocks.\" They may be abrupt with patients or avoid difficult conversations. They may not demonstrate the kind of empathy and concern that you would want to have in your relationships with patients, or that you would want for your loved ones if they were ill. Some residents and attendings will deride your interest in patients as irrelevant, perhaps describing it as \"warm and fuzzy.\" If you are a trainee, it is easy to fall into the rhythm of a prevalent culture, and to develop cynicism and doubt. If you practice the relationship skills in this module, and realize the value of connecting more deeply with patients; if you experience the positive effects that your skills have on your understanding of patients' illnesses and their well-being, you are more able to withstand the pressures of the \"hidden curriculum.\" |Personal Support| | | The physician should make explicit statements that express that he or she is there, personally, for the patient and wants to help. This of course must be an honest statement, or it will not be effective. Statements like the following indicate personal support: |Click on the picture-button on the left to see an example of personal support.| |Physician:|| | \"I want to help in any way I can.\" or \"The reason I'm here is because I am concerned about your health, and I want to do whatever is needed to ensure that you stay healthy,\" (or, \"...that you recover,\" or, \"...that you suffer as little as possible.\") The assurance of direct personal support is partidcularly important when situations are changing rapidly or in those situations where there is considerable uncertainty about diagnosis or treatment, or where anxiety or tension or conflict is paramount. Your statement of personal involvelment means a lot, and leads to improved rapport and solidification of the doctor-patient relationship. |Partnership| | | Patients are more satisfied with physicians and are more likely to adhere to treatment recommendations when their physicians assure them that they are working in close partnership, and that the physicians are as attentive to the patients' needs and requests as to the technological or biomedical demands of the situation. Truly working together as partners cannot occur unless physician and patient agree on an understanding of the task in hand. The first task is the process of the interview itself. It may sometimes therefore be helpful for the physician to offer brief explanations in advance of certain components of the interview such as the inquiry into personal and social factors. An example might be, \"It would be helpful to know a bit about your personal circumstances because sometimes this has a bearing on how best to sort out your problem.\" (module 5) Increasing the participation of the patient in his or her own treatment improves the patient's coping skills and improves the likelihood of good outcome from illness processes. Physicians' work is much easier when patients sense a clear joining together to find the best solutions, especially for thorny and difficult problems. |Click on the picture-button on the left to see statements of respect and partnership.| Physicans can promote this type of partnership, by making statements like the following: |Physician:|| | \"Let's work together in developing a treatment plan once I have reviewed some of the options with you.\" or, \"I'll need your help as we go along, to be certain that I fully understand your ideas and your concerns about situations that come up--this is about your health, and I want to be sure we are working in synch with each other.\" |Behavior Checklist| Beth A. Lown MD and Ronald B. Saizow MD | | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | for Reflection:| |Key Principles:| |Learning goals:| |Learners will implement strategies to elicit all patient concerns, and to reach agreement on collaboratively constructed visit agendas.| |OPEN THE DISCUSSION: BASICS| |Introduce yourself| | | If you have not met the patient previously, it is important to introduce yourself and your role on the health care team, including identification as a student or resident if appropriate. Patients appreciate the respect demonstrated by addressing them by their last names, and using their titles (e.g. Mr., Dr., Reverend) when appropriate. If uncertain, you can ask patients how they would like to be addressed. If you address patients by their first names when they address you by your title, an implicit imbalance of power is created that can affect the nature of the relationships and may convey to patients a sense of disrespect and diminishment. If you are a medical student or resident, it is best to identify yourself as such: \"Hi, I'm --------, a third year student on your medical team.\" \"Hi I'm Dr. -------, a surgical resident. I'll talk with you about your problems and do a physical exam, and then Dr. ------, the attending physician will be in to see you.\" |Allow patients to complete opening statements without interrupting| | | Each clinical encounter begins with the clinician's invitation to the patient to share the symptoms and concerns. Once you have asked a patient about the reasons for the visit, wait without interrupting until you've heard the complete response. Waiting until patients complete their opening statements has a number of benefits. Patients feel heard, and understand you are interested in their stories. It conveys to patients that they should do more of the talking, and may encourage them to give you a fuller account of their symptoms and concerns. It also encourages patients to express their full range of concerns, which they may not do if interrupted. Numerous studies of medical students, residents, and experienced physicians demonstrate early interruption by clinicians, usually within 18-23 seconds of the patient beginning their opening statement. ( [1](references.htm#1), [2](references.htm#2)) In the recent study by Marvel and colleagues ( [2](references.htm#2)), clinicians offered patients the opportunity to complete their statements of symptoms and concerns in only 23-28% of visits ( [2](references.htm#2)). Patients who were allowed to complete the expression of their concerns took an average of 32 seconds to do so, and interviews in which the complete agenda was solicited lasted only 6 seconds longer ( [2](references.htm#2)). In another recent study, patients' mean spontaneous talking time was 92 seconds and 78% of patients finished their opening statements within two minutes ( [3](references.htm#3)). Clinician interruptions and unilateral direction of the agenda may be one explanation for the findings of Stewart et al., that doctors failed to elicit 54% of patients' reasons for coming to the doctor and 45% of their worries ( [4](references.htm#4)). Marvel and colleagues found that once the clinician focused the discussion on a particular concern, the likelihood of seeking additional concerns was quite low (8%) ( [2](references.htm#2)). |Survey all symptoms and concerns before focusing on one issue.| | | Patients in the ambulatory setting have an average of 3 concerns per office visit ( Survey all of the patient's symptoms and concerns briefly at the beginning of the interview before exploring any one in depth. This habit is helpful and important in both inpatient and outpatient settings. You may assume that the patient's first stated concern is the most important one. In fact, concerns are infrequently revealed by patients in order of their importance to them ( [8](references.htm#8)). They may withhold their most important concerns or emotionally laden topics until they feel they can trust you, feel confident that you really want to know their concerns, or until you bring up the topic ( [9](references.htm#9)). Elstein and colleagues found, in their classical analysis of medical problem solving, that experienced, competent clinicians begin generating tentative hypotheses very early in patient encounters from clusters of clues. They revise their hypotheses as additional information is obtained ( [7](references.htm#7)). Effective hypothesis generation depends on the clues obtained from the patient and how the clinician organizes and analyzes them. Therefore, an initial comprehensive survey of concerns may enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. |COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES TO ELICIT CONCERNS| |Facilitating the patient's opening statement| | | Start with open questions to elicit the patient's reasons for the office visit or symptoms that prompted hospitalization, such as, \"What brings you in today?\" \"Open\" questions require explanation and elaboration. \"Closed\" or specific questions can be answered with yes/no, or a few words. |Explain the process| | | Explain to the patient that your initial goal is to create a full list of concerns in order to plan how best to use the time available for the encounter. You will make a more detailed exploration of concerns after you and the patient have a chance to understand the full range of concerns. The full range will include whatever the patient says, as well as concerns that you have, which the patient may not be aware of or attuned to; such as an abnormal laboratory finding or discussion of prevention issues. |Use the core skill: Ask, \"What else?\"| | | Following the opening statement, you then direct the patient to state additional concerns, by asking \"What else?\" You may continue prompting the patient by asking \"what else\" or using a class of linguistic devices called \"continuers,\" such as \"mmh\", \"I see\" or \"I understand.\" Patients will often mark the end of their list of concerns by saying \"That's all.\" Checking with the patient by asking, \"Are you sure that's all?\" or \"I have the feeling that there might be something else\" encourages the patient to reveal their hidden concerns and agendas. |Direct and redirect the patient to establish the full list of concerns| | | This interviewing technique requires active direction by the clinician. Patients usually begin telling the full story of each concern, instead of simply listing the name or \"title\" of the concern (back pain, sleep problems, etc). Sometimes it is useful to interrupt and make a clarifying statement such as, \"This sounds like an important concern to you. I will return to it but first I'd like to hear if there are any other concerns that you would like me to know about?\" You may need to redirect the patient several times, and repeatedly ask \"What else?,\" until the patient completes their list of concerns. You may be uncomfortable with the directiveness required in developing the list. However, patients generally wish to assist your attempts to understand their problems, and readily adapt to this method especially when it is explained in advance. Many will begin coming to subsequent visits with their lists prepared. |Ask about both physical and psychosocial symptoms and concerns| | | At the beginning and throughout the medical interview, continue your elicitation of patient's concerns, fears, hopes and expectations as well as the physical symptoms that prompted the visit or hospitalization. As noted previously, the first symptom or concern expressed by the patient in the office or hospital setting may not be the only one, or the most important either to you or the patient ( [8](references.htm#8)). Patients frequently have underlying concerns and requests which they are not comfortable divulging until they feel comfortable in the relationship with the clinician ( [9](references.htm#9)). Patients are more likely to express themselves, whether during brief encounters or ongoing relationships, when you care enough to ask, listen to their responses, and indicate willingness to help or to get help for them. Examples of patients' unvoiced agenda items include worries about possible diagnoses and illness, their seriousness and what to expect, ideas about the cause of their symptoms, side effects of treatments or medications, and social information ( [10](references.htm#10)). You can ask directly: \"What are you most worried about,\" or comment on their expressed emotions, \"You seem pretty upset about these symptoms.\" Patients' expression of these worries and concerns may engender painful feelings such as sadness or anger. You must be prepared to attend to these emotions before completing the agenda. (module 6, \"Build the Relationship\" and module 9 \"Understands the Patient's Perspective\" explore this issue in more detail.) Sometimes patients themselves are not aware or can't describe what's bothering them physically or psychologically. The untangling of the patient's symptoms and their associated worries may emerge during the course of the interview. If you don't understand the full scope of reasons why the patient has come to seek medical help, you won't be able to adequately diagnose or provide what the patient desires and needs. This may result in poor outcomes for both patient and clinician. Incomplete solicitation of symptoms or concerns is also associated with patient concerns arising late in ambulatory interviews, decreased time management efficiency ( [12](references.htm#12)), and failure to expose hidden agendas ( [13](references.htm#13)). In addition, misunderstandings and non-adherence to prescribed treatments may arise when patients' ideas, symptoms and concerns are not fully identified ( [14](references.htm#14)). Patients who leave a visit with unvoiced desires and unfulfilled requests report being less satisfied with their care ( [15](references.htm#15), [16](references.htm#16), [17](references.htm#17)). |Summarize and add clinician concerns| | | Once you elicit the patient's full list of concerns, summarize them back to the patient to check that the list is correct and complete. After checking with your paitent, add your own issues (e.g., your concern about a lab test or a prevention issue, or something the patient overlooked) and begin the process of negotiating and agreeing on the agenda for the encounter. The following table lists questions and other skills that facilitate your eliciation of all patient concerns: |Communication opening statement| |Explain the process||\"I would like to make a list of all of your concerns before we focus on any one them.\"| |Redirect||\"I'll get back to that.\" about both illness affected you?\"| |Summarize patient and clinician concerns||\"Let me see if I have everything . I also need to check on \"| |Reaching an agreement| |Prioritize and negotiate the visit agenda with the patient| | | In most clinical settings time is limited, and taking time to set an agenda results in more efficient and more patient-centered interviews. In the outpatient setting, you must attend to acute problems, following-up on previous problems, counseling and prevention. In both ambulatory and hospital settings, you must often discuss diagnostic procedures and complex medical regimens and surgical procedures. You may have to use specific strategies to reach agreement on the agenda for the encounter depending upon the number or complexity of concerns and the time allotted for in-patient discussions or ambulatory visits ( [Figure 2](#2)). Because scheduled time may not allow evaluation of every concern, it is essential that both the patient and you prioritize the concerns. Whatever concerns cannot be addressed at that time may be followed up at subsequent encounters. You may begin this segment by asking patients to rank order their top priorities among the full list of concerns elicited earlier in the discussion. At this point, you should state and explain any urgent or important biomedical or psychosocial issues you have identified during the discussion or based on additional clinical data available. If these issues could adversely impact the patient's health and require immediate or timely attention, you must address them during the present interaction in accordance with your proessional responsibility. You can frame the process of reaching agreement on the agenda by telling patients the amount of time allocated for the encounter. This may be expressed in minutes or as a brief, intermediate, or comprehensive appointment. Time-framing is a useful strategy to help clarify what issues can reasonably be discussed in the allotted time. Part of agreeing on an agenda is to \"flag\" some issues for follow-up at subsequent scheduled visits. When you are explicit about this process, you indicate to patients that their concerns have been heard and will be systematically addressed over time. Figure 2 [. Reach agreement on the visit agenda] |Communication strategy||Example clinician statements| |Ask patients to state their your concerns, what are your highest priorities today?\"| |State urgent clinical issues as priorities||\"I am quite concerned about your blood pressure of 200/100 which I think we must address today.\"| |State time available||\"We have 15 minutes (or intermediate visit) today. Which of your priorities did you want to be sure we addressed today, given the time available?\"| |Reach agreement and summarize||\"Let's start by talking about our two top priorities: your blood pressure and your sleep problems.\"| |Reassure that other concerns will be addressed later.||\"We can address the remaining concerns at the next visit.\"| ***module=07 page=4_1.htm*** |Patient and clinician barriers to negotiating an agenda; risks of incomplete agenda setting| | | Clinicians often believe they have no time or insufficient reason to elicit all patient concerns and negotiate a mutually agreed upon agenda. Research suggests that careful agenda-setting improves efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient satisfaction. Patients allowed to complete their list of concerns usually take only 32 150 seconds to do so ( [1-3](references.htm#1)). A comprehensive initial survey improves efficiency, as it diminishes the likelihood of hearing about important new issues (like chest pain) late in the interview, just when the visit seemed about to end ( [1](references.htm#1) [,2](references.htm#1)). Such late arising concerns frequently prolong medical encounters. The elicitation of all concerns reduces the frequency of late arising concerns by more than half (34.9% vs. 14.9%) ( [2](references.htm#2)). You enhance diagnostic accuracy by surveying patients' concerns and reacing agreement on priorities. Patients' initial complaints may not predict the problems truly important to them, according to research that ranked problems after encounters were finished. Burack and Carpenter showed that the patient's chief complaint predicted the patient's primary problem only 6% of the time for psychosocial problems, and 76% of the time for biomedical problems ( [18](references.htm#18)). Many clinicians shy away from eliciting and hearing numerous patient concerns, because they feel compelled to do something about each one, or because they don't feel comfortable responding to patients' emotions. Patients often simply want you to hear and understand their concerns, not necessarily to act upon them ( [8](references.htm#8)). The concerns that do require further attention may be dealt with in subsequent visits. Patients are often confused by the interruptions and redirecting of physicians when intially participating in this process. They respond very positively to compassionate explanations, such as the following: \"I see from your reaction that this seems a bit odd or confusiing, but I am very concerned and want to make our time together as effective as possible in meeting your needs.\" and, \"Many of my patients did not like this work at first, but setting the agenda has helped us work very well as a team.\" |CONCLUSION| Patients usually present to primary care offices with an average of three concerns. Elicitation of all of the patient's symptoms and concerns in the ambulatory and in-patient setting requires little additional time and diminishes the likelihood of late arising concerns or hidden agendas. In addition, this strategy may enhance diagnostic accuracy. You can use the strategy of beginning with an open question and allowing patients to complete their opening statements without interruption to begin the elicitation of a comprehensive list of symptoms and concerns. You can then use continuers, such as \"what else?\" and direct patients to provide a complete list of concerns before discussing any one issue in depth. You include your agenda items and use the strategies of time-framing and priority negotiation to establish the visit agenda. In this manner, you can efficiently establish a realistic, prioritized agenda for the visit. Remaining concerns can be attended to in scheduled continuity care visits. Clinicians who explain this process at the beginning of the visit and reach agreement about a mutually constructed agenda enable patients to collaborate and participate in their care. |BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST| |REFERENCES| (1 [) Beckman HM, Frankel RM.

Lown, MD You greatly improve your patients' outcomes when you jointly contstruct the story of the illness, weaving the patient's elaboration of the biomedical and psychosocial threads together with your own hypotheses. The primary goals of information gathering are to elicit biomedical and psychosocial information in order to generate clinical hypotheses, and to understand the context and impact of the patient's illness while continuing to build You can greatly improve your patients' outcomes when you jointly construct the story of the illness, weaving the patient's elaboration of the biomedical and psychosocial threads together with your own hypotheses. The medical encounter begins when two people enter into a relationship with hopes of understanding, help, and healing. One of the major functions of all medical encounters is the development of a relationship between the physician and patient that enables them both to realize these hopes. Skillful physicians efficiently gather accurate biomedical and psychosocial information to generate hypotheses about possible causes of the patient's symptoms, while gaining an understanding of the patient's experience of illness. They listen for and develop the \"narrative threads,\" ( [1](references.htm#1)) or subplots and clues about the patient's disease and the personal meaning of illness, weaving them together into the tapestry of the clinical history. This approach combines the patient's voice with the physician's elaboration of the medical details. The result is a jointly constructed story that integrates the world of the clinician and the world of the patient. |The primary goals of relationship-centered information gathering| | | The primary goals of information gathering are to elicit biomedical and psychosocial information in order to generate clinical hypotheses, and to understand the context and impact of the patient's illness. Your skills in accomplishing these goals will help you to build a more effective patient-doctor partnership. These goals are accomplished when the clinician: These goals and premises form the foundation of a relationship-centered approach to communication and care [(2](references.htm#2)). We call this a relationship-centered approach because it combines the expertise, values and needs of the patient with those of the clinician. |Information gathering skills and outcomes| | | Patients who feel they have been able to fully express their symptoms, concerns, opinions, and questions have more symptom resolution, less role and physical limitations, improved functional status, and improved health outcomes such as blood pressure and blood glucose level. Communication training designed to enhance physicians' understanding of the patient as a person and ability to share control of the medical encounter by encouraging the patient's participation, can lead to significant improvement in these interviewing skills and result in increased patient satisfaction.( [3](references.htm#3)) Patients' anxiety and symptoms are reduced when physicians are trained to ask about patients' understanding of the nature and impact of their problems as well as their concerns and expectations.( [4](references.htm#4), [5](references.htm#5)) Research by Roter et al. showed that skills training designed to teach physicians to delineate the patient's problem by starting with open-ended questions, using facilitative statements to help patients tell their stories in their own words, and assessing the effect of the patient's problem on psychosocial functioning did not increase length of visits, and reduced patients' emotional distress.( [6](references.htm#6) [)](references.htm#5) Patients who feel they have been able to fully express their symptoms, concerns, opinions, and questions have more symptom resolution, less role and physical limitations, improved functional status, and improved health outcomes such as blood pressure and blood glucose.( [7](references.htm#7), [8](references.htm#8), [9](references.htm#9), [10](references.htm#10)) These studies support the goal of teaching physicians to share control of the discussion and to facilitate patients' talking about their concerns and the impact of illness. |Primary vs. secondary sources of information| | | When time is short, relying on the \"old chart,\" is tempting. Secondary information may be helpful or inaccurate, and can never supplant a personal interaction. Before we begin to discuss how to gather information, let's consider the validity of the various sources from which clinical histories are obtained. This may sound obvious, but whenever possible, you should elicit the patient's story directly from the patient. In the clinical years of training, you often read or hear a snapshot of the patient's history from a triage nurse, a house officer, or the patient's old medical record before speaking with the patient. It's tempting to rely on the summaries of others, or to rewrite previous histories from the \"old chart\" especially when time is short. Secondary information is often quite helpful, but may be incomplete, inaccurate or biased. It's important to formulate your own independent opinion about the patient's situation based upon primary data; your interview with the patient, his or her family, or caretakers. |Organize the flow of the interview in the time allotted| | | Learn and practice strategies for coping with time limitations. The duration of the average U.S. office visit in 1998 was 18-22 minutes.( [11](references.htm#11)) Clinicians have to balance both the needs of individual patients with the other demands on their time. We can enhance our time management by using an organized approach to new patient and health maintenance visits, and by trying to establish the agenda and goals of a visit early in the encounter (see doc.com Module 7: Open the discussion). This does not mean, however, that we must stick to a rigid format or agenda. On the contrary, relationship-centered interviewing requires flexibility as the clinician continues to elicit and respond to the patient's symptoms, concerns and needs throughout the interview. The process of exploring the patient's history as it unfolds, agreeing on the goals of the visit, redefining them when new problems arise during the conversation, letting the patient know how much time is available, and explaining transitions between topics are all helpful and respectful strategies for efficient time management. |Understand the \"Chief Complaint\" and expand the \"History of Present Illness (HPI)| | | Thoughtful attention to story elements enables you to decide which hypotheses and ideas you should probe to the fullest extent. The medical interview begins with the elicitation of the patient's primary symptoms and concerns. This has traditionally been called the patient's \"Chief Complaint\" or reason for admission when speaking with hospitalized patients. It is usually the answer to the question, \"What brought you to the hospital?\" Ambulatory patients may come to the office with one or several acute, subacute or ongoing problems. Furthermore, as we learned in module 7 \"Open the discussion,\" patients may not always tell their physicians their underlying \"Chief Complaint\" right away, especially if their primary concern is psychosocial rather than biomedical.( [12](references.htm#12)) Once the clinician has elicited the patient's initial concerns, the interview proceeds with an inquiry into the agreed upon agenda items. In hospitalized patients, the clinician surveys all of the patient's concerns and symptoms in a similar fashion before exploring any particular symptom in depth during the exploration of the \"History of Present Illness.\" The \"History of Present Illness,\" (HPI) or description of the patient's current symptoms, is one of the most difficult and important aspects of the patient's story. All of the information needed to formulate and test hypotheses about the patient's disease and the psychosocial context of the patient's illness must be elicited whether the patient is in the hospital or in the outpatient setting. The patient's diagnostic evaluation and subsequent treatment plan is based on the \"HPI\". Therefore, it's important that the HPI be elicited carefully in detail, and presented clearly to others. |COMMUNICATION SKILLS | that improve information gathering | | Practice and utilize these skills, and your competence at information gathering will steadily improve. Clinicians use many different communication skills to gather information effectively and efficiently. In this section we will focus on 6 skills: |Use an open to closed question strategy | Begin with open questions | | Start interviews with open questions, because patients respond by revealing relevant (often surprising) information more readily than to closed questions. Effective interviewers begin with open questions until they have an overview of the patient's story. Open questions require some explanation or description. They cannot be answered with single words or yes/no responses. You might tell the patient that you would like to hear a brief summary of what happened before you begin to ask detailed questions. You can elicit much of the content of the HPI using this open-ended method of questioning. Open questions reveal substantially more relevant information than closed questions and are therefore a more efficient way to begin the interview.( [13](references.htm#13)) Patients are the only true experts on what has happened to them. You can ask an endless series of closed or specific questions to try to get closer and closer to their experiences, but it's faster and simpler to just ask patients to describe it for you. A \"high control,\" closed questioning physician style can result in an incomplete database.( [14](references.htm#14)) For example, let's suppose a patient says she has chest pain. If your next question is, \"Is it sharp or dull?\" the patient may assume she has to pick one of these adjectives, which may not accurately reflect her physical sensation at all. Or, she may say, \"neither,\" leaving you in the position of having to present several alternative description choices until it is closer to her experience. You might need to ask a multitude of closed questions to accurately understand the series of events or physical sensations the patient has experienced, which is an inefficient use of time. There are two types of open questions: general open questions, and focused open questions. You use general, open questions to begin an inquiry when the territory or range of concerns is unknown. This type of question allows patients to begin their stories at the point that feels most important or most comfortable. Focused, open questions allow patients to continue to unfold their stories, but on a focused topic of interest to the interviewer. |General, open question:||\"Can you tell me what brings you in today?\"| |Focused, open question:||\"Can you tell me more about your chest pain?\"| Once you have asked enough open-ended questions to elicit an overview of the patient's story, you can then ask specific or closed questions to better characterize the symptoms, probe the details and facilitate hypothesis testing. For example, if the patient feels ill and has been coughing, you might be considering respiratory infections. It would be important to ask specific questions such as, \"Have you had any fever?\" or \"Are you bringing up any sputum?\" |Use an open to closed question strategy| | | Experienced clinicians weave open and closed questions throughout the discussion of the HPI. ( |Check out the video example | about \"open to closed question strategy\" on the left. During the interview they may realize a point or discover a symptom that requires further clarification, or challenges their hypotheses, and explore this with open questions until they understand more, then switch to specific questions to clarify further. This process proceeds from open to closed to open to closed questions until all major symptoms have been explored, one or more hypotheses generated, and supporting or negating evidence elicited. Thus, they weave information into a constructed tapestry that blends the threads of the patient's story with the clinician's thought processes and clinical reasoning. |Develop the timeline of the illness| | | Explore chronology by asking \"what happened first (or next, or later or over the next few hours, etc)?\" Every story has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Eliciting an accurate chronology helps patients organize their stories of illness, and often gives clues to underlying disease processes and contributing psychosocial factors. |Check out the video example | about \"developing the timeline\" on the left. When does this patient's story truly begin? Try asking the patient these questions: | | Beginning questions: | | \"Go back to the beginning. What was the very first thing you noticed that felt unusual or different?\" \"When did you last feel well?\" | | Middle questions: |\"How did your symptoms change over time?\" | \"What happened next?\" | | End questions: |\"Have you experienced anything similar in the past?\" | \"What finally prompted your seeking attention now?\" How did the story evolve over time? How does the story end in the patient's current condition? Trace the chronological unfolding of the story over time by asking: \"What happened next?... and then what happened?\" until you have elicited and heard a blow-by-blow description. |The key skill in developing the timeline is asking \"what happened next?\"| | | Learn to ask for all the details about key symptoms in the patient's story. Several important aspects of symptoms must be characterized in order to generate hypotheses about their cause and treatment. The general context of symptoms is the background within which the HPI occurs and develops. Who is this patient? What is going on in his or her life at the time the story begins and evolves? What are the psychosocial and physical factors that may be playing a role in the patient's illness? |Alan R's chest pain: | Alan R. is a 52 year old accountant who came to the emergency department in early April for evaluation of chest pain. The morning of this episode, the patient learned that his sister-in-law, who had been battling metastatic breast cancer, had died leaving behind his brother and their two teenage children. Mr. R. had been under a good deal of stress at work, working long hours as it was approaching the income tax deadline for his clients. The specific context contains the details of what is happening in the patient's life and immediate surroundings at the time of acute onset of symptoms. |Alan R's chest pain (cont.): | The patient drove to his brother's home and parked at the bottom of a hill. As he dashed up the hill, he began thinking about the grief and distress he would soon encounter. He noticed the sudden onset of discomfort beneath his breastbone which increased in intensity as he approached his brother's apartment house. - [top](#top) - | | Try to imagine what the patient's symptoms might feel like. Ask about their quality as if you were going to write a short story about the symptoms. The most important aspect of a patient's physical symptoms is its quality. What exactly is the patient trying to describe to you? As you progress through training, you develop an expanding databank of experience regarding how various diseases present. A patient's description of various symptoms then triggers associations with specific disease entities, and guides hypothesis generation, which in turn directs further inquiry. Students and clinicians in training might try a strategy for understanding clinical symptoms that I call the use of \"somatic imagination.\" Try to imagine what the patient's physical symptoms might feel like as if experiencing them yourself. If you can't imagine experiencing the symptoms yourself well enough to describe them clearly to a friend, ask more questions. Don't offer patients descriptive adjectives before eliciting theirs. Ask patients to describe the quality of their symptoms until they have exhausted their descriptive vocabulary. It is important to really listen to the words patients use to describe their symptoms, and use those words when reflecting back to the patient. If the patient speaks of \"a pressure,\" do not then say something like, \"so did this pain radiate anywhere?\" - [top](#top) - | | Inquire, \"What makes the symptom better, (or worse).\" Ask patients what makes their symptoms better (palliation) and worse (provocation). Ask if there were any triggers that initiated the symptoms. Triggers and aggravating and relieving factors will give diagnostic clues. After asking in an open-ended way, you should ask questions that relate to your differential diagnoses: Did cold air trigger the patient's wheezing and shortness of breath? Was there any relationship between the time the patient began taking anti-inflammatory medicines and his epigastric pain? What happened to the patient's calf pain when he stopped to rest? The answers to many of these questions yield important clues about diagnoses. - [top](#top) - | | Find out exactly where the symptom is, and where it goes. If the symptoms are localized to a particular area of the body, ask patients to indicate exactly where they are experiencing them. Generalized or systemic symptoms such as fatigue and malaise cannot be localized, but can be characterized using the other descriptors indicated. Some symptoms have characteristic patterns of radiation or representation in areas of the body other than their site of origin, such as the left arm and jaw discomfort associated with chest discomfort from coronary ischemia, or posterior leg pain from sciatic nerve impingement. |Alan R's chest pain (cont.): | Mr. R had difficulty finding words for the sensation he had experienced as he was dashing up the stairs to his brother's apartment. It wasn't painful exactly, but rather a sense of an increasingly oppressive, diffuse sense of substernal and left sided chest pressure, \"as if a great weight had been placed there and was squeezing the breath out\" of him. He had no discomfort elsewhere. - [top](#top) - | | Ask about the severity of the symptom. Characterizing the severity of symptoms helps the clinician understand their cause, significance, and the urgency with which they must be attended. The \"crushing\" substernal chest pain of myocardial infarction, or \"thunderclap\" headache of subarachnoid hemorrhage are classical descriptions of problems requiring urgent attention. Many clinicians ask patients to rate pain symptoms on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the most severe. This is helpful to follow the progress of symptoms and efficacy of therapy. - [top](#top) - | | Ask patients how often they experience the symptoms, and how long they last. Quantification of the number of episodes of a given symptom within a specified time period is also important, such as number of diarrheal stools per day, or number of episodes of chest pain weekly. Progression of physiologic and functional impairment can be tracked over time by quantifying symptoms such as number of blocks the patient is able to walk before the leg pain of peripheral vascular disease (claudication) sets in; or number of stairs the patient with congestive heart failure is able to climb before stopping to catch her breath. The duration of symptoms also provides clues about diagnosis and severity. An anginal episode seldom lasts longer than a few minutes, so it's less likely to be angina if a patient says the chest pain lasted \"all day.\" Or, a major depressive episode may be diagnosed if depressed mood persists along with other features for a 2-week period or more. |Check out the video example | about \"characterizing symptoms \" on the left. - [top](#top) - | | Be diligent in discovering associated symptoms to help you test hypotheses. Once you understand the quality and evolution of the patient's symptoms over time, you begin to generate some preliminary hypotheses about their etiology. Your knowledge of the presentation of the diseases in your differential will guide your questioning about associated symptoms. This will help you to either support or set aside a particular hypothesis. For example, in the case of Alan R, you would ask if he experienced any nausea or sweating, since these symptoms are associated with myocardial infarction. You would also ask symptoms associated with panic disorder, and might ask about symptoms associated with reflux esophagitis, costochondritis, and other diagnoses that can cause chest pain. |Check out the video example | about \"exploring associated symptoms\" on the left. - [top](#top) - | | Find out about dysfunctions, disabilities and adaptations the patient makes because of the symptoms. You should ask, \"how have these symptoms affected you?\" If the patient is having acute symptoms, what functional and psychological effect are they having? Did the patient fall over, double up in pain, have to sit or lie down, go the emergency room, call family members? Was the patient frightened, puzzled, concerned, terrified? If the symptoms are subacute or chronic, why is the patient coming to see you now? The patient's answer to this question often uncovers hidden anxieties or new interpretations about the meaning of previously tolerated symptoms. If the symptoms are chronic, what adaptations has the patient had to make? What is the functional impact of illness on daily activities? Can the patient dress, feed, bathe, go to the toilet, transfer from bed to chair, from chair to standing, pivot, walk independently, drive, shop, handle finances, do errands such as purchasing medications? What equipment is necessary at home? What losses has the patient suffered because of illness? Has the patient had to grieve or adjust to the loss of a vocation, a job, support networks and friends because of functional impairment or disability? How has the illness affected others important to the patient? |Alan R's chest pain (cont.): | When he reached the top of the stairs, Mr. R. stopped to catch his breath and rang the bell to the apartment. His brother opened the door. His other siblings and his mother had already arrived. The children had not yet returned home from school. He was relieved that his brother seemed calm and that the family was on hand to lend support. He sat down to rest. His chest pain gradually began to subside and was gone within 20 minutes. In retrospect, he vaguely recalled an episode of chest discomfort a few weeks prior after an argument with his boss. It had not been as severe and had lasted only a few minutes. He had ascribed it to \"indigestion\" at the time. He described his symptoms to his family who called an ambulance to bring him to the Emergency Department for evaluation. Much of the HPI and symptom characterization can best be elicited and explored with these questions: |Symptom Characterization ||Questions| |Context of symptoms ||\"What was going on in your life when this began?\" \"How did this all start?\"| |Illness timeline ||\"Can you start at the beginning and tell me how this unfolded?\" \"When were you last feeling well?\" \"What happened next?\"| |Quality of symptoms ||\"What did that feel like to you?\"| |Aggravating, relieving factors ||\"What makes it better or worse?\"| |Location, radiation ||\"Exactly where do you feel it?\" \"Does it go anywhere else?\"| |Severity ||\"Can you rate the severity on a 1 to 10 scale, with 10 being the worst you can imagine?\"| |Duration ||\"How long does it it occur?\"| |Associated symptoms ||\"Can you describe any other physical sensations you had when this all began?\" \"What else were you feeling?\" \"Did you notice any...(based on hypotheses).\"| |Impact of symptoms||\"What did you do when you experienced these symptoms?\" \"How have you adapted to this illness?\" \"What was it that made you decide to come in today?\"| - [top](#top) - |Listen actively| | | Practice \"listening on multiple levels;\" ( Active listening is an acquired skill that involves \"listening on multiple levels,\" ( [18](references.htm#18)) the active use of verbal and nonverbal encouragements to speak, and the facilitative and therapeutic use of silence. Clinicians learn to \"listen on multiple levels.\" We listen to the gestalt and the details of the patient's story as well as its emotional and practical impact on the patient. We learn to listen to and interpret \"paralanguage,\" the pauses, pace, pitch and volume of patients' conversations. The rising pitch and volume of an anxious or angry patient tells us as much as their words. We can also learn to \"listen\" to ourselves and our internal reactions to patients. Our own reactions are often helpful mirrors of the patient's state of mind. Our personal experience of helplessness or sadness while listening to a patient, for example, clues us into a possible diagnosis of depression. While we are listening and trying to understand and imagine patients' experiences, we are formulating hypotheses about the patients, their diagnoses, their emotional states, and what we will need to do next. One of the challenges of clinical listening at multiple levels is retaining the ability to focus on the patient's experience, remaining \"present\" with the patient while balancing all of the other intellectual tasks of doctoring. This is a difficult and important skill which requires continuous practice and professional commitment. Nonverbal and verbal encouragements of speech, such as head nods and \"uh hm\" are important ways to facilitate the patient's expression. Another aspect of active listening is the intentional use of silence. This can be difficult, especially for students and residents. We are trained to problem solve, to take action, to intervene. Yet, there are times when sitting quietly with a patient, especially during emotionally difficult moments, communicates powerfully that we are listening, that we can hear what they have to say, that we respect them, that they can go on with their stories. Your attentive and respectful silence can be a potent therapeutic intervention. |Clarify meaning| | | Clarify important words that may have different meanings for you and for your patients. Both open and closed questions can be used to clarify unclear words or statements. It's astonishing that one word can have so many meanings for different people. For example, the word \"dizzy\" is used by patients to describe many different sensations including a swirling feeling as if one just flew off a merry-go-round, a sensation associated with dimming or tunneling of vision just before blacking out, blurry vision, trouble concentrating, nervousness or anxiety, fatigue, difficulty with balance, and a host of other meanings. Each of these sensations has different clinical implications. If you aren't clear about what patients are describing, ask them to clarify. |Check out the video example | about \"clarify meaning\" on the left. | Examples of clarification: | \"I'm not sure I understand exactly what happened. Can you go back to when you were climbing the stairs and \" \"What do you mean by stressed? Can you tell me what has been stressful?\" \"The word 'dizzy' means different things to people. What do you mean when you say, 'dizzy'?\" |Summarize| | | Summarize, to communicate your understanding of the patient's story, and to encourage your patient to clarify and fill in any gaps. When you feel you understand a patient's history of illness, you can tell the patient you would like to summarize and would like the patient to correct any inaccuracies or omissions. Summarizing out loud reveals the gaps in your understanding. It's a good way to check on the spot for internal consistency, flow and logic. Patients appreciate accurate summaries because it indicates good listening. It also gives the patient a chance to correct any misunderstandings and to expand the story if need be. |Check out the video example | about \"summarize\" on the left. | | Alan R's chest pain (cont.): Doc: \"You were rushing up a hill to your brother's home when you developed some pressure, like a weight on the left side of your chest, which made it difficult for you to catch your breath. This lasted about 20 minutes until you were able to sit and rest and then the symptoms subsided completely. In retrospect, you may have had something similar a few weeks ago during an argument with your boss. All of this occurred while you were really upset over the death of your sister-in-law and concerned for your brother, in addition to your stress at work.\" |Redirection and transitions| | | Respectfully guide the interview by redirecting the patient and by using transitional statements. You can use verbal redirections and transitions as respectful bridges to biomedical or psychosocial issues. When you \"announce\" your transitions, or explain your thought process to the patient, you take the patient along on the path of inquiry. The patient is more likely to feel respected and included as a partner rather than the subject of a clinician-driven agenda. Sometimes you will decide to make a transition in the conversation. You may wish to further explore a symptom, or to change topics because time is limited, or to interrupt your patient who is talking about a subject not directly related to the present situation, or to explore remaining important psychosocial topics. At times when you wish to respectfully redirect the conversation, it is helpful to explain what you're doing and why. | Examples of redirection and transitions: | \"I would like to hear more about this, but in order for us to decide what to do next about your cough, I'll need to ask you a few more questions. O.k.?\" \"I'd like to move on now to ask you about your past medical history.\" |COMMUNICATION SKILLS | that encourage patient participation | | Verbal dominance, a narrow biomedical focus, interruptions, and a barrage of closed or leading questions tend to consolidate physicians' control of medical interviews with the potential sequelae of incomplete data collection, inefficiency, and lower patient and physician satisfaction. ( Sharing control of talk-time and discussion topics, avoiding interrupting the patient, and encouraging patient participation in discussions will improve data gathering and patient satisfaction. You are also more likely to understand your patient better and feel more satisfied with your interview. The initial minutes of interviews communicates to patients how you want the interview to go. If you start interviews with open questions, really listen to your patients, and encourage them to tell their stories, you are conveying to them that you want them to fully express themselves. If you interrupt patients early on, and ask many closed questions, you are conveying to patients that you are the one in charge and expect brief answers. You are then likely to continue a doctor-centered interview, since this is what you set up. |Share talk time: | Avoid verbal dominance and high conversational control | | Share talk time by using open questions, encouraging patients to speak, avoiding interruptions, and listening attentively. Studies show that many physicians flaunt the usual social rules of conversation, like, \"Take turns and don't interrupt!\" in interactions with patients. Physicians often speak more than patients and control the topics of conversation ( [20](references.htm)), rather than sharing the discussion by using communication strategies that are relationship-centered, and by including topics important to the patient. Interruptions are one way in which a speaker gains control over conversation. ( [21](references.htm)) Some interruptions are unavoidable, and some may be beneficial, as when patients interrupt to offer new information, or physicians interrupt to redirect a patient on a tangent. Use of interruptions must be tempered by respect, a sense of partnership, and awareness of their consequences. Asking a barrage of closed questions, using medical jargon, asking leading or negatively phrased questions (\"You don't have any chest pain, do you?\") create an atmosphere of high clinician control. This tends to diminish patients' willingness and ability to speak. Asking a string of questions often baffles patients. A common version of this is, \"Do you have any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath?\" If the patient replies no, the clinician doesn't know for sure if the response applies to one or all of these symptoms. Beginning students will often also adopt a high control style in their anxiety to elicit information from patients. However, it is important to remember that most patients will want to tell their stories, if you will let them. It is best for many reasons to let patients do a good deal of the talking. You can accomplish this using the open to closed cone strategy, including using \"continuers,\" such as \"anything else?\" \"uh huh,\" and \"can you me more?\" patients' telling their stories. |Integrate biomedical with psychosocial issues| | | Help patients expand their story-telling. Open windows of opportunity to fully appreciate the complexity of patients' stories. When primary care physicians focus narrowly on biomedical topics, they dampen patients' expression and there is minimal exchange of psychosocial information. ( [19](references.htm#19)) In a study of over 100 primary care physicians and over 500 or their patients, a narrowly biomedical, physician-dominated communication pattern was the most common pattern, and was associated with the lowest satisfaction ratings by both patients and physicians. Patients appreciate physicians who integrate psychosocial with biomedical topics, share talk-time and are less verbally dominant. ( [34](references.htm#34)) In general, patients don't distinguish the biological and emotional components of their symptoms. Patients present with symptoms that comprise an illness, and we as their caregivers often then search for clues to underlying diseases. As we learned in earlier modules, though, patients' experiences of symptoms are affected by personality, past experiences, fears, and expectations. Interviewers who focus on the medical details to elaborate a differential diagnosis may unconsciously filter out patients' comments about their worries or the meaning of their symptoms, and then miss the \"windows of opportunity\" into the heart of the patient's hopes and fears. ( [22](references.htm#22)) All the available studies emphasize that patients' symptoms and outcomes improve, patients' psychological distress diminishes, and both physicians and patients feel more satisfied when physicians ask about both psychosocial and biomedical problems and encourage patients to participate in these discussions. ( [23](references.htm#23), [24](references.htm#23)) |Elicit and explore clues| | | Learn and practice the Elicit, Explore, Acknowledge and Respond tactic A strategy helping clinicians gather and integrate psychosocial with biomedical information during interviews is to use repeating cycles of: Elicit, Explore, and Acknowledge/ Respond. ( [25](references.htm#25), [26](references.htm#26)) A minority of distressed patients reveal their most significant psychosocial concerns during the opening segment of an interview. Most patients who disclose such concerns do so later in the medical encounter, and usually only in response to an explicit inquiry. ( [27](references.htm#27)) Just as you continue to construct the patient's history of symptoms and your hypotheses throughout an interview, continue to build an understanding of the patient's psychosocial issues and concerns throughout the interview. You will be more efficient if you check on patients' concerns throughout the interview than if you wait until the interview is closing. ( [28](references.htm#28), [29](references.htm#29)) | | \"What other concerns do you have?\" \"Was there anything else you wanted to mention?\" \"You looked upset when you mentioned your father.\" \"Can you tell me what concerns you most about these symptoms?\" Patients seldom express psychosocial concerns directly. Rather, they embed \"clues\" about the rest of their lives, their worries, and their expectations as they tell about their symptoms. One study about these clues categorized the findings as follows: statements involving: projection or denial of feelings and concerns (\"I'm not really worried but my wife keeps nagging at me to get this checked out.\"); vivid symptom descriptions (\"This pain is torturing me like an executioner!\"); attempts to explain (\"I've been wondering if this rash is from something I ate.\"); loaded statements or questions (\"I hear this pill you've given me can cause breast cancer.\"); and behavioral clues (e.g. patients who go for multiple opinions, or don't follow through on treatment plans).( [30](references.htm#30)) Many primary care physicians and surgeons ( [31)](references.htm#31) do not regularly pursue these clues, and fail to acknowledge patients' feelings.( [32](references.htm#32)) Visits with these missed opportunities are longer than visits in which physicians were responsive, so exploring clues may actually enhance efficiency in the interview. ( [25](references.htm#25)) Conversation that sounds logical to the clinician who is pursuing a particular differential diagnosis may sound to a patient like a non-sequitur, inattention to psychological or emotional content, and at worst, disrespect. | | Alan R, continued: Example of a missed \"window of opportunity\": Mr. R: \"That feeling in my chest reminded me of my father. He had a heart attack when he was 53 same age as me.\" Mr. R. looks away distracted. Doc B: \"Did you have any nausea with the chest When verbal or nonverbal clues about emotions or concerns are dropped, the patient may mention them again, mention them with increasing emphasis and anxiety, or set them aside. ( [33](references.htm#33)) Anchoring statements in what's just been said helps the clinician explore clues and gather additional information. Responding to the patient's clues about underlying concerns and emotions tells the patient you have heard her and strengthens your relationship. | | Example of stepping through a \"window of opportunity.\" Mr. R: \"That feeling in my chest reminded me of my father. He had a heart attack when he was 53 same age as me.\" Doc B: \"Your father had a heart attack when he was 53? What happened?\" Mr. R: \"He died. That's when I took over helping my mother watch out for my brothers and sisters.\" Doc B: \"So your father died at your current age. That must be making this even more frightening for you.\" Mr. R: \"Yuh. It worries me.\" Doc B: \"I can certainly see how it would (pause). Is there anything else you wanted to tell me about that?\" Mr. R: \"No, I just want to know what's happening with me.\" Doc B: \"Ok. Would it be ok if I asked you a few more questions?\" Mr. R: \"Sure.\" |Respond to important clues| | | Practice and become adept at responding to clues and feelings in real time. You may not be able to respond to every clue or expression of emotion. Smith suggests that statements about feelings (\"I'm feeling sad.\"), nonverbal expression of emotion (sighing, unhappy facial expression), and more vivid expressions of emotion (crying, laughter) are at the top of a hierarchy of clue importance. ( [33](references.htm#33)) These expressions always warrant further exploration and response. Similarly, if a patient keeps reintroducing a series of clues concerning a specific topic, they should be explored in more detail. Some experienced clinicians listen closely, encourage the patient to continue, and then respond to a group of clues with a single empathic response. One group calls this \"the lasso effect.\" ( [32](references.htm#26)) We discuss helpful responses to emotions in [ Module 6: \"Build the Relationship\"](../../module_06/1_intro/index.htm) |COMMON PITFALLS IN GATHERING INFORMATION| Using secondary rather than primary sources of information. Narrowing the focus prematurely with closed questions. Restricting information gathering to biomedical areas. Failing to clarify differences in the meaning of words or statements. Controlling conversations rather than facilitating a collaborative dialogue with the patient. Failing to reopen inquiry about the patient's symptoms and concerns throughout the interview. Failing to elicit, explore or respond to verbal and nonverbal clues. |SUMMARY| |BEHAVIORAL SKILLS CHECKLIST| Lown, MD | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Author: | | 2.0 - 7/23/2009 - Update to doc.com Version 4.0 1.0 - 6/27/2005 |Rationale| | | by Beth A. Lown, MD You greatly improve your patients' outcomes when you jointly contstruct the story of the illness, weaving the patient's elaboration of the biomedical and psychosocial threads together with your own hypotheses. The primary goals of information gathering are to elicit biomedical and psychosocial information in order to generate clinical hypotheses, and to understand the context and impact of the patient's illness while continuing to build Understanding your patients' perspectives can help you understand them as unique individuals and why they are ill now. In order to understand, ask about patients' finances, culture, literacy, how they understand their illnesses, stresses, and other personal issues. Several trends in American medicine unfolding over recent decades produce an ever-widening gap between patients' experience of illness and their physicians' perspectives. These include the ascendancy of biomedical research with its panoply of new medications and technologies ( [1](9_0.htm#1)), increasing economic pressures on physicians to see more patients in limited amounts of time, a complex and inequitable healthcare system, and increasing diversity of patients in education, culture, language, literacy and socio-economic status ( [35](9_0.htm#35)). Patients who discuss their perspectives, their symptoms and their care with their clinicians show improved clinical outcomes and are more satisfied ( [4-7](9_0.htm#4)). Physicians can develop skills to communicate with patients about their perspectives and integrate new understandings into mutually agreed upon diagnostic and management plans. This module will focus on the contextual domains and skills necessary to elicit and explore patients' experience from their point of view, and show how these explorations transform care. |EXPLORING PERSPECTIVES TRANSFORMS CARE, RELATIONSHIPS AND PHYSICIANS| | | Viewing illness through your patient's eyes transforms your care from a purely technical undertaking to a healing endeavor. Physicians often fail to recognize patients' life issues that are adversely impacting their health. During inpatient rounds, a resident presented a 38-year-old woman who was recovering from a severe bout of her frequently recurring asthma. She had been critically ill and intubated during hospitalization three months previously. This time her recovery was rapid, and she was out of intensive care, ready to start oral medications. When I asked, \"Why does this woman keep getting sick?\" There was silence until one student ventured, \"She is a smoker -- that probably contributes.\" I suggested that we should ask the patient for her perspective. It was much more than cigarettes; with minimal encouragement she explained that her mother died suddenly two years ago. She felt tremendous guilt that she had not done enough for her mother and resumed her crack addiction, after having been entirely clean for a dozen years. She was now homeless, had no health insurance and couldn't afford her medications. We realized that the team had focused on curing the acute asthma but had not understood her illness. To prevent future hospitalizations the patient needed drug rehabilitation, counseling, and social work intervention. As many as one third of primary care patients have life issues (excluding psychiatric diagnoses such as depression and anxiety) they identify as adversely affecting health at an office visit, yet physicians' recognition of these factors varies widely ( [8](9_0.htm#8)). During case presentations, the social history is frequently omitted as \"noncontributory ( [9](9_0.htm#1)),\" but patients' cultural assumptions, beliefs, fears, and expectations are of major significance to them. In fact, all illness etiology, expression and treatment depend heavily on the patient's beliefs and expectations. To be effective in your explorations with patients, you must sustain a belief in the importance of your inquiry, listen to answers non-judgmentally, and prepare to examine your assumptions about patients. We all carry preconceptions, often unconsciously. |Understanding the patient's perspective brings you into relationship, supplements your technical work, and transforms you.| Viewing the illness through the patient's lens transforms your patient relationships from purely technical undertakings to fully human and healing endeavors. As you explore your patient's perspective in the face of illness and suffering you will sometimes become deeply connected. These unique and privileged moments are gifts that infuse your work with meaning and purpose, and allow suffering patients to feel joined and less alone. Your gifts of yourself, through full attention, caring and compassion, are neither less important nor more crucial than your technical competence. All are necessary, and each is insufficient without the others. Competent patient care includes each element because the information obtained and the process of obtaining it will help illuminate why and how the illness is active at this point in time and which interventions are feasible at this moment. Maintaining a balance between giving to patients and preserving your self, between expressing compassion and functioning technically in a steady and competent fashion is a central challenge of clinical work. Empathic understanding transforms physicians. Coulehan calls this Contextual elements of patients' lives significantly influence their health status. Your understanding of these elements affects your patient relationships and your ability to effectively manage care. |Dr M. saw Ms. H., a 3rd year medical student, for an illness that began six months ago with numbness and tingling in her left leg. The initial symptoms resolved, and in this second episode, Ms H had numbness in her arms and hands and found it difficult to raise her right arm to brush her hair. Dr M's exam confirmed weakness as well as sensory deficits. He was concerned about a demyelinating process such as multiple sclerosis. Dr M and Ms H discussed this possibility as well as her thoughts and fears. Dr M wanted to address Ms H's fatigue and the need for rest with her before she left the office.| Dr. M: \"Let's do the MRI and then we'll get together to talk about it How's it going in your clerkships?\" Ms. H: \"OK, I guess. I'm pretty much exhausted all the time but I've liked the clerkships I've done so far especially pediatrics.\" Dr. M: \"That's great. That leads me to wonder if the demands of third year are going to be a bit too much for you right now. We may need to think about your taking some time off or slowing down your on-call schedule until we know what's going on and you're feeling better.\" Ms. H: \"I don't think I want to do that. It would be hard on the rest of the team and on me not to do what everyone else is doing. I'm o.k. for now.\" Dr. M: \"I can see how committed you are but we may have to make some adjustments.\" | | Discussion: |Aspects and relevance of social context| Important social context considerations include the patient's roots, cultural identity, gender, sexual orientation, education, language and literacy, occupation, primary relationships and support network, religious or spiritual practices, leisure activities, stressors, mood, and financial status as it pertains to healthcare and daily needs to maintain health ( [12-14](9_0.htm#12)). These contextual aspects comprise major elements of personal identity and significantly influence health status. Further, physicians' understanding of these elements strongly affects patient relationships and physicians' ability to effectively manage care. This remainder of this module highlights selected components of the patient's context and the major impact of differences in how patients' understand and explain illness. Other modules address cultural identity (see module 15), gender (see module 18), sexual orientation (see module 18) and spirituality (see module 19). Many of these elements are contained in the \"Social History.\" (see module 5) We present evidence about the utility of this information and discuss the process of eliciting and understanding the patient's perspective. |Socioeconomic and insurance status affect health outcomes| | | Socioeconomic status strongly predicts health status. Lack of health insurance predicts higher mortality and adverse health outcomes. | Mr G, 44, came to urgent care because of lightheadedness. He recently began working for a construction company and was painting a building on a sunny day when he felt lightheaded. He managed to get off the scaffolding, rested, got up to get some water, but noticed his vision \"tunneling in\" as if he were about to pass out. Friends brought him water but he remained lightheaded, so he came in. Mr G has had hypertension that was difficult to control on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, beta blocker, and diuretic. At the clinic, his sitting blood pressure was 100/60 and pulse 65, standing 80/60 and pulse 65. His physical exam was otherwise unremarkable and EKG showed only sinus bradycardia. | Doctor N thought that dehydration superimposed on Mr G's antihypertensive regimen had caused the symptoms. He decided to ask about life issues. Doctor N: \"So what do you think caused this problem?\" Mr G: \"I hate to admit it, doc, but this is the first time I have had insurance for years, and this is the first week I have taken all my medicines. Before, I have filled one or another prescription whenever I could afford it. I suppose I should have told someone.\" |Discussion: | Socioeconomic status is a strong predictor of health status, and lower socioeconomic classes have significantly higher mortality and poorer health. The report, \"Income, Poverty and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2003\" shows increasing disparities in income and health. In 2003, 35.9 million people were living in poverty, an increase from 2002, with children under 18 representing the greatest percentage (35.9%). People in the poorest households were 4-5 times more likely to die in the next 10 years than those in the richest ( |Communication about insurance and money| | | Your uninsured patients are often reluctant to talk about lack of money and insurance. Patients may be unable to follow their clinician's advice due to financial and insurance problems. Patients may be embarrassed to admit that they didn't fill a prescription, or tried to stretch out the prescription by taking the medicine every other day. Communication research data show that patients are more willing to disclose this information if their physician inquires in a non-judgmental fashion. Talk about financial and insurance issues | | Normalize the issues by saying: \"Some patients have financial problems that can affect their health\" Elicit information by asking questions such as: |Cultural factors related to healthcare| | | You may differ from each patient in many culturally determined ways. Culture is \"the lens through which we give our world meaning.\" ( [18](9_0.htm#18)) It can be broadly defined as \"an integrated pattern of learned beliefs and behaviors that can be shared among groups and include thoughts, styles of communicating, ways of interacting, views of roles and relationships, values, practices, and customs.\" ( [19](9_0.htm#19)) Culture is another important aspect of patients' social context. Patients' and clinicians' cultures and clinicians' cultural competency significantly affect the patient-physician relationship and the clinician's ability to understand the patient's perspective. We are all immersed in multiple cultures by virtue of characteristics such as age, gender, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, professional training, socioeconomic status, religion, and geographic location, to name a few. In fact, each patient-physician encounter is in itself a cross-cultural encounter between the culture of medicine and the culture of that unique individual's life-world. |Your major challenge is to identify whether cultural processes are influencing communication in a given conversation.| The challenge is to understand which cultural processes or issues are salient to a particular and unique patient at any given time. You should familiarize yourself with communication patterns, health habits, special religious or ethnic beliefs and prevalent diseases in the various cultures and communities in which you practice. However, it is important not to apply generalized assumptions based on one aspect of culture or apply generalizations to individual patients. (\"Older people dislike revealing themselves to younger doctors\"). |Cultural Competency| | | Culturally competent physicians hold the assumption that neither their own cultural perspective, nor their patients' cultural views are \"superior;\" nor is the culture of medicine the only way to understand illness Cultural competency or \"cross-cultural efficacy,\" ( [28](9_0.htm#28)) is the ability to hold the assumption that while different, neither yours nor the other person's culture is superior. Milton Bennett describes a continuum in the development of intercultural sensitivity. People typically progress from ethnocentric stages of denial, defense or minimization of difference to the ethno-relative stages of acceptance, adaptation and integration of difference.( [21](9_0.htm#21)) The shift into ethno- relativism as defined by Bennett is mediated by empathy (see doc.com module 6), or the ability to temporarily shift one's frame of reference to see the world \"as if\" through the eyes of another person. Several models for effective cross-cultural communication training exist. ( [39-41](9_0.htm#39)). In this module, we highlight some core cultural inquiry skills; Module 16 goes into more detail about understanding and negotiating cultural differences in medical settings. Core cultural issues include how patients regard individual autonomy vs. group authority when making decisions about healthcare; mistrust of physicians and the healthcare system based on prior experiences of discrimination; non-verbal styles of communication such as eye contact and personal space; perceptions of the role of the physician and efficacy of biomedicine; the role of cultural traditions and customs; and gender or sexual-orientation based roles and expectations within cultures. | | Inquire about core cultural issues |Conflicts between patients' expectations and the culture of medicine| | | Your patients may not share your biomedical \"explanatory model.\" | | Ms R., 38 years old and a concert flute player, was hospitalized with lower lobe pneumonia and bronchospasm on IV antibiotics, inhaled beta-agonist bronchodilators, prednisone, and fluids. Her team was pleased that she was doing well and anticipated discharging her in a day or two. Ms. R. believed she got pneumonia because extensive travel had weakened her resistance. She wanted to know how to strengthen her body to prevent future episodes. She felt her hospital based physicians focused solely on her acute symptoms. Her career was blossoming and she had more travel scheduled in the near future. She remained upset and anxious and decided to see an acupuncturist to bolster her immune system when she returned home Physicians live and work in the culture of biomedicine and disease. But patients experience illness and suffering, and physicians may fail to appreciate the power of this difference in perspective between them and their patients. Even when the patient and clinician are aligned on many aspects of culture, the patient may explain and understand the experience of illness in ways profoundly different from the clinician's understanding of the disease process. Differences in meaning-making cause misunderstandings, poor adherence to recommendations and poor clinical outcomes. Kleinman suggests nonjudgmental questions that will help physicians understand patients' beliefs about illness. Physicians who employ this type of inquiry will better appreciate their patients' perspectives about illness and treatment. ( [22](9_0.htm#22)) | | Kleinman's \"explanatory model\" questions will help you elicit patients' beliefs, and initiate dialog that clarifies potential culturally based trouble spots: |Self-treatment| | | Many of your patients will try home remedies, complementary or alternative therapies. Most patients take some action to relieve symptoms. Many patients use healing practices specific to a culture with which they identify. Sixty seven percent of U.S. respondents used at least one complementary and alternative therapy in their lifetime. ( [23](9_0.htm#23)) The extensive use of folk healing practices and complementary therapies ( [24](9_0.htm#24)) suggests that clinicians will often receive useful data in response to a question such as, \"Do you see other therapists or healers for advice about your health?\" | | Elicit information about self-treatment behaviors: |Language and literacy| | | Language barriers contribute to suboptimal health outcomes. Language barriers play a part in suboptimal healthcare and outcomes. In the U.S. population over 5 years old, 17.9% speak a language other than English at home. Over 21 million people speak English \"less than very well.\" ( [25](9_0.htm#25)) Elicit information about language: Seek help from professional interpreters, since patients are reluctant to discuss personal issues when family members or friends interpret for them. | | Health literacy is defined as \"the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.( [26](9_0.htm#26))\" The National Adult Literacy Survey showed that nearly 50% of adults have difficulty understanding and acting on health information. Health-related materials are often not written at the level of patients' reading and comprehension skills. In one large survey, 42% of patients could not understand directions for taking medicine on an empty stomach and 26% did not understand information about their next scheduled appointment. Patients with low literacy have worse health outcomes and greater risk of hospital admission ( [27](9_0.htm#27)). Low literacy correlates with lower adherence to anticoagulation therapy, poor diabetic control, and higher health care utilization and costs.( [39](9_0.htm#39)) Elicit information about literacy: | | Generally, people are ashamed of reading and comprehension problems, and are more likely to respond to invitations offered gently and in a non-judgmental fashion. Recommendations for uncovering this problem in a nonjudgmental fashion are shown below. (see doc.com module 10 for patient education suggestions for patients with low literacy) | | Normalize the issue by saying: |Healthcare disparities and the role of the clinician| | | All healthcare relationships contain seeds of healthcare disparities. Clinicians may apply conscious and unconscious stereotypes that perpetuate healthcare disparities. | Mr. S., a 32 year old man with sickle cell trait, was hospitalized for the third time in the past 6 months, this time for a hot swollen knee. The orthopedics consultant tapped the synovial fluid, found no evidence of infection, and suggested that the patient had an anserine bursitis. | On teaching rounds, the intern presented Mr. S's history and indicated suspicion about Mr. S's complaints of severe pain. The attending physician demonstrated a moderate knee joint effusion, limited range of motion and no tenderness over the anserine bursa. After the team left the bedside, the attending asked how the physical findings affected their differential diagnosis. A resident stated that regardless of diagnosis, the patient was \"a drug-seeker.\" Therefore his complaint of pain was unreliable and should not affect plans for treatment or disposition Studies indicate that clinically meaningful disparities in healthcare persist even after adjustment for socioeconomic factors ( [28](9_0.htm#28)). Research substantiates the presence of socially conditioned and usually unconscious prejudicial attitudes among providers ( [19](9_0.htm#19)), whose perceptions are affected by patient ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status and other factors. Some evidence suggests that time pressure, the need to make rapid judgments, task complexity and cognitive load increase the likelihood of applying stereotypes. Many factors contribute to the application of stereotypes ( [29](9_0.htm#29)), including cultural and individual differences, language barriers or differences in communication style in the description of symptoms. Another factor, particularly in the presence of clinical uncertainty, may be physician use of categorization strategies to simplify the cognitive processing of complex information ( [30](9_0.htm#30)). People match individuals to various social categories, which spares the use of cognitive resources, but can lead to the use of stereotypes through which attitudes and beliefs about a group of people are unconsciously applied to an individual thought to be a member of the group ( [31](9_0.htm#31)). |Assumptions, trust, disparities and justice| | | It is important to be mindful of our own biases, assumptions and stereotypes. Stereotyping leads to bias and disparities in care ( [19](9_0.htm#19)). The assumptions physicians and patients make confound appropriate health care. Over 700 physicians who viewed videotapes of actors portraying patients with chest pain referred women and blacks significantly less often for cardiac catheterization than men and whites. ( [36](9_0.htm#36)) When clinicians believe that patients won't adhere to treatments, they are less likely to make recommendations ( [19](9_0.htm#19)). Furthermore, a legacy of racial discrimination and mistrust of health professionals, especially within the African American population, discourage some patients from seeking care or following up on it ( [32](9_0.htm#32)). Every physician has a professional responsibility to recognize and minimize healthcare disparities, and to promote social justice within the health care system ( [33](9_0.htm#33)). Diversity training and studies demonstrate that \"perspective-taking,\" especially when focused on imagining a particular group member's feelings, can arouse feelings of empathic concern and reduce prejudice and stereotyping ( [34](9_0.htm#34)). Every physician has a personal responsibility to know their patients as individual persons rather than as a conglomerate of stereotypes, social categories, or unexamined biases, and to strive to understand their patients' perspectives on healthcare matters. |CONCLUSION| | | Understanding the patient's perspective and context, recognizing when it's different from your own, and reflecting upon your own perspectives and assumptions form the foundation for relationship-centered care, and may help to reduce healthcare disparities. |BEHAVIOR SKILLS CHECKLIST| |LITERATURE REFERENCES| |Welcome to Lown, MD | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Author: | | 2.0 - 7/27/2009 Update to doc.com Version 4.0 1.0 - 6/27/2005 |Rationale| | | The introduction section of this module is outlined as follows: |How much information should clinicians share with patients?| | | The word Doctor derives from Latin, \"docere\" which means \"to teach.\" Relationship-centered information sharing improves outcomes. However, patients' desires for information are often not met in clinical practice. The burgeoning number of websites on health topics attests that patients want information about their bodies and their health. In particular, patients want their clinicians to provide health-related information.( [1](9_0.htm#1)) Studies indicate that patients' psychological distress improves, symptoms resolve, and clinical outcomes (eg, blood pressure control) improve when physicians supply clear information with emotional support.( [2-5](9_0.htm#2)) When clinicians supplement their information with printed materials, patients' mood, anxiety and function improve and pain decreases.( [6-8](9_0.htm#6)) Effective patient education improves adherence to plans,( [9](9_0.htm#9)) and patient education programs that include self-management strategies result in reduced healthcare utilization, less lost work time and improvement in symptoms.( [10](9_0.htm#10)) Physicians overestimate the time they spend educating patients and under-estimate how much information their patients want.( [11-13](9_0.htm#11)) A large nationwide survey noted that 10% of discharged patients reported not receiving information they wanted, and 25% felt they didn't receive enough information about how much pain and discomfort to expect during procedures or post-operatively. One third of patients said their doctors and nurses didn't answer their questions understandably, and up to 45% of patients said they weren't told what danger signs to watch for after discharge.( [14](9_0.htm#14)) |What are the goals of sharing information?| | | To further empower patients, we teach many patients self-management skills that are based on two assumptions. The first is that if patients and clinicians collaborate as partners, they can define goals and strategies better than either could do alone.( The essential goal of sharing information is to empower patients to optimize their health. Traditional patient education teaches patients how their bodies function in health and in specific disease states, and how to maintain health and prevent illness. When patients have symptoms or are ill, we share information about diagnosis and diagnostic testing plans, including risks, benefits, alternatives, and results. We help patients understand about prognosis, what to expect; and the components of treatment plans and the rationale for them. Physicians and other healthcare professionals teach technical and home monitoring skills that allow patients to manage chronic illnesses effectively. Self-management education emphasizes self-directed goal setting and behavioral regulation.( [16](9_0.htm#16)) It teaches patients self-monitoring techniques (such as keeping symptom diaries, blood sugar, blood pressure, or peak flow measurements) and encourages patients to keep records of whether prescribed interventions affect their symptoms (such as taking nitroglycerin before anticipated exertion). Patients learn how to adjust their medications according to a written action plan tailored to their needs and disease severity.( [17](9_0.htm#17)) They can apply problem-solving skills to medical issues as well as social and emotional problems that arise when coping with chronic illness.( [18,19](9_0.htm#18)) Physicians who help patients link with community resources enhance the effectiveness of this approach to patient education.( [20](9_0.htm#20)) For patients with chronic diseases, traditional patient education compares poorly to self-management education. For example, programs that focus on asthma knowledge do not decrease hospitalization rates, doctors' visits for asthma attacks, time lost from school or work, medication usage, or improve lung function.( [21](9_0.htm#21)) In contrast, establishing collaborative relationships results in fewer symptoms, cost benefits from fewer hospitalizations and emergency visits, improved lung function and better quality of life.( [22](9_0.htm#22)) Arthritis self-management education produces similar outcomes and cost reductions.( [23](9_0.htm#23)) |Will patients retain information?| | | People are most motivated to learn when they identify a need or a problem. Use exploration of current knowledge, repetition, checking feelings and checking understanding to maximize retention. Adult learning theory transformed our approach from the notion of passive information transfer to the facilitation of active, collaborative, self-directed learning.( [24](9_0.htm#24)) Most adults prefer to be self-directed, and are motivated to learn when life experience introduces a need, a problem or an interest. For information you wish to convey, exploring patients' existing knowledge about a particular issue and building upon their knowledge, past experiences and current needs helps you facilitate their learning.( [25](9_0.htm#25)) Other specific teaching strategies are associated with good patient recall. These include simplification, repetition, specificity, reinforcement, exploring patients' ideas and feelings about the information, and checking the patient's understanding.( [26](9_0.htm#26)) (see module 9) |Patients are often afraid to ask questions| | | Embarrassment or worry impedes patients from asking for additional information. Anticipate this or use gentle prompts to help reluctant patients disclose concerns and ask questions. Patients want information, but may not ask key questions because they are afraid of the answer; such as in, \"Am I going to die?\" \"How long do I have to live?\" \"What if I don't wake up from anesthesia?\" or because of embarrassment or a sense of shame; such as, \"Will this affect my sex life?\" \"Did I do anything to make this happen?\" Patients may be embarrassed about not knowing how their bodies work, not doing what is good for them and do not want to appear ignorant or negligent. Often you may anticipate that patients will fear asking certain questions, and can address the issues directly, \"Many patients worry about resuming sex after they have had a heart attack. Is that a concern of yours?\" Patients frequently wait to ask the embarrassing questions until the end of the encounter. They will only ask them if they trust that you will be non-judgmental and perceive you have the time. Stating up front that you have the time, and want to answer all their concerns, and continuing to ask, \"Are there other concerns?\" will often bring out the deepest or more embarrassing concerns. You could also ask gently, \"Is there anything you've been afraid to ask me?\" |Knowledge, science, uncertainty and information-giving| | | Say \"I don't know\" when you don't, and modulate your information giving when the information is emotionally charged. Medicine is a profession based upon knowledge and science, as well as uncertainty. Patients know that new science emerges daily, that today's truth may be proven wrong by tomorrow's evidence and that no clinician can keep up with every new development. They appreciate that acknowledging uncertainty is a sign of clinical maturity rather than academic weakness; as long as you demonstrate that you care enough about them personally to seek relevant information on their behalf. It's important to say, \"I don't know\" when you don't, to seek the information you need, and to bring your findings back to the patient. When your information giving is emotionally charged you should also clarify with your office staff or hospital team who is the most appropriate person to share information with a given patient. In advance, determine how much content will be shared, especially when discussing test results, prognosis, or communicating bad news. Giving premature advice, tentative plans or reassurance to patients and families before obtaining and clarifying all of the relevant information is counter-productive and can be harmful. |LEARN THE FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY FOR SHARING INFORMATION: | ASK-TELL-ASK | | When clinicians share information they predominantly TELL information, often in too much detail, and in terms that sometimes alarm patients. Information sharing is most effective when clinicians remain sensitive to the emotional impact of their words. By using a strategy of ask-tell-ask, you will greatly enhance patients' understanding and promote adherence to plans. Adult learning theory and self-management education strategies inform us how to communicate most effectively and teach information to patients. The fundamental points are that we need to stay in dialogue (not monologue), begin with an assessment of the patient's needs, tell small chunks of information tailored to those needs, and check on the patient's understanding, emotional reactions and concerns. This is summarized by the three step format, \"Ask-Tell-Ask.\" Each step includes several discrete issues. A simple skill, namely, alternating between telling small amounts of information, then checking for understanding and asking your patients about its effect on them, will help you effectively modulate the amount and type of information that you share and efficiently communicate what your patients need most. |What to ask and tell| | | ASK to assess patient emotional state and the patient's desire for information. TELL small amounts of information in simple language, and ASK about the patient's understanding, emotional reactions and concerns. Many conversations between clinicians and patients sound like, \"Tell-Tell-Tell,\" and some people call this monologue \"doctor babble,\" because physicians seem to be talking to themselves, rather than having a dialog or conversation with patients. Remember to use the Ask-Tell-Ask format so that you remain in dialogue with your patients. Here is a list of the ASK's and TELL's that covers important areas for sharing. Click on the hyperlinks to go directly to the section indicated. [TELL information about diagnosis, treatment or other aspects of the situation](2_30.htm) [ASK about the patient's understanding, emotional reactions and concerns](2_40.htm) |ASK to assess patient needs| | | The ASK section consist of the following items: |ASK: Assure privacy, check with the patient that setting is conducive| | | Patients cannot properly receive and react to information if the setting is disruptive or public. Physicians should not share sensitive information in public places. Consider the setting before sharing information. Do all you can to ensure that the setting is conducive to a comfortable and honest information exchange. Sharing information in a hallway, when the patient is on a stretcher in a busy ER, or in a waiting room breaches the patient's right to privacy. If a hospitalized patient is in a semi-private room, you may want to draw the curtains, or, if the information you need to share is sensitive, you may want to move to a more private setting. Turning off radios or TV's can be helpful. You may need to ask people to step outside, or include appropriate family members or friends. You should sit down if telling all but the most elemental information. |ASK: Assess the patient's physical and emotional state| | | If patients express emotional distress, acknowledge, explore and respond to their feelings at the moment of their expression. If patients are upset or anxious, address their emotions and concerns before trying to share information. Sharing information when the patient is sleepy, sedated, in pain or emotionally distraught is not respectful and the information won't be remembered. With hospitalized patients, ask if the patient is comfortable and ready to talk. If they are not comfortable, take steps to assure their comfort. |Check out the video example | about \"assessment of the patient's physical and emotional state\" on the left. Here are some more examples: | | Patient A: Doctor A: | | Patient B: Doctor B: | | Patient C: Doctor C: |ASK: Assess the patient's informational needs| | | Elicit the patient's questions and concerns up front, asking \"anything else?\" until the patient acknowledges that all concerns have been expressed. It may be helpful to write down the questions and concerns, and you may need to negotiate priorities and timing for providing extensive information. Find out what information the patient wants, and in what format. Some patients want detailed information about their conditions, tests and proposed treatments, recommendations for reading, websites, self-help groups, and referrals to other consultants. Others want an overview and general understanding. Patients may want other family members to be present for support or to help them remember key points. Be prepared to respect the patient's wishes. Reaching agreement with the patient about what information to review may require negotiation if your understanding of the issues, priorities, or goals are different. Also, some patients may need more time, so you might agree to discuss the key points, and plan to address others later, or refer them to other staff or health educators. | | Doctor A: | | Doctor B: | | Doctor C: | | Doctor D: | | Doctor E: |Case Mr.P and Dr. L.| | | Sometimes the patient's informational needs are greater than the patient imagines. Mr. P. is 76, admitted with worsening angina pectoris in the setting of non-operable coronary artery disease. He has diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and renal insufficiency, as well as other chronic medical problems. During the admission his anti-anginal regimen was adjusted and additional medications added for diabetes. A nutritionist talked with Mr. P about an appropriate diet. Prior to his discharge, Dr. L sat down with Mr. P. to review his medications and diet and exercise instructions. He looked distracted, so she asked, \"You look preoccupied. What's the matter?\" He replied, \"Well Doctor, the real problem is my wife. She has multiple sclerosis and I have to lift her onto the commode, wash her up, get her into the chair and then back into bed. I'll be lifting her, feel my angina coming on and it scares me, but what can I do? I just try to tough it out. I have my son at home. You know, he's schizophrenic and he's been away for the past month anyway. I've got my sister staying home with my wife now that I'm in here, but she'll have to go back home to her husband. So I'll do my best about taking my medicines and eating right and all, but sometimes it's just about all I can do to take care of her and don't tell me to put her in a nursing home! I don't want to hear about it.\" In Mr. P's situation, information about his medications and disease processes is not sufficient. His physician needs to think with him about where to get household assistance, how to avoid situations that precipitate his angina, and when to call for help or emergency services. He also needs ongoing emotional and medical support from his physician. |ASK: Assess the patient's knowledge and understanding| | | Building on baseline knowledge-targeting your information-is efficient and respectful, and more likely to transfer the new information than if you start with whatever you assume is most important. Learning theory suggests that adults learn best by building on previous knowledge. Find out what previous knowledge or relevant experience patients have about a symptom, or about a test or treatment. Include this data as you shape the information you share; you might tell different information about diabetes to a PhD biochemist than to a construction worker. Assess patients' understanding of the nature of their problems in the context of their lives, their motivation to address these problems, and the barriers they must overcome. |Check out the video example | about \"assessing the patient's knowledge and understanding\" on the left. Patients may understand the essentials of blood sugar control, for example, but their poor control is related to financial and social issues. Others, well motivated, do not understand how blood sugar relates to ingestion of certain foods, or how much insulin to take for a certain blood sugar level. Sometimes when you ask about patients' understanding, they reveal feelings. For example, asking a depressed patient his understanding of depression might elicit, \"I don't know, I guess I'm just a failure \" After responding to the emotional expression, you can then educate about common emotional reactions in depressive disorders, and discuss some of the neurochemical basis of depression. Learn to ask directly: \"Tell me your understanding about the causes and complications of diabetes\" Assessing patients' understanding of a topic enables you to target your education, and build on the patient's baseline knowledge. |ASK: Assess the patient's attitudes and motivation| | | Patients will not be interested in hearing your health information if they are not motivated, or if they have negative attitudes about the outcomes of their efforts, so ask about this directly. You can start by asking general questions about attitudes and motivation: \"So tell me how you feel about all of this?\" \"This is a complicated regimen. How do you think you will manage?\" If patients are not motivated, ask why, and help the patient work through the issues. A useful framework for understanding and responding to patients' levels of motivation is the Health Belief Model. (see [Appendix](5_0.htm)) Do not give up when patients express lack of motivation or unwillingness to follow your advice. Good evidence about what you might say and do instead of using exhortation or admonishments exists, and much of this is outlined in Module 16 For this module, we focus on simpler encounters. |ASK: Determine the patient's level of literacy| | | Low literacy is common and seriously limits understanding. Ask simple questions that check literacy, and learn resources that you can make available to patients. Over 40 million people in this country have low literacy skills and may not be able to read written information. Further, literacy is strongly linked to comprehension of important medical issues.( [27](9_0.htm#27)) For example, a study in both English and Spanish diabetic patients showed that only half with low literacy knew the symptoms of hypoglycemia (compared to 94% with higher literacy), and fewer patients with hypertension and low literacy knew that blood pressure could be lowered with diet and exercise.( [28](9_0.htm#28)) Patient education materials, discharge instructions and standard consent forms are written at higher reading levels than many patients can understand.( [29](9_0.htm#29)) Do not assume patients' literacy level based upon their level of education or their self-reported reading abilities, because neither predicts actual literacy.( [30,31](9_0.htm#30) [) ](9_0.htm#27) |Check out the video example | about \"assessment of the patient's level of literacy\" on the left. You can inquire about literacy by asking: Doctor C: \"How happy are you with the way you read?\"( [32]) Doctor D: \"Some of my patients have trouble with reading. Are you able to read this?\" Patients who cannot read are embarrassed, so be sure to respond non-judgmentally and with empathy. Familiarize yourself with resources available to help patients in your clinical environment. Verbal review of instructions, checking patients' understanding, clarifying and answering questions, drawing pictures and diagrams each helps patients remember and recall information.( [33](9_0.htm#33)) Pictures of clocks indicating the time medicines should be taken, with colored pictures of the pills to be taken (or actual taped-down samples of the pills) next to the correct time increase understanding and adherence. |TELL (share) information about diagnosis, treatment or other aspects of the situation| | | Strategies for TELLING information include: It is difficult to understand and retain large amounts of information, especially when one is physically ill, upset or fearful. Find reliable resources and educational aids to meet the needs of your patients. |TELL: Keep each bit of information brief| |It is difficult to understand and retain large amounts of information, especially when one is physically ill, upset or fearful.| Share information that's based on what the patient wants and what you feel you need to convey. Don't try to convey more than a few pieces of information at a time. |Check out the video example | about \"keeping each bit of information brief\" on the left. |TELL: Use a systematic approach| |Use a template that you can practice and repeat consistently. For example, name the problem, the next step, what to expect, and what the patient can do.| Use a consistent strategy so you can be organized and more effective at facilitating patients' learning. Ley and colleagues suggest the following basic template for sharing information.( [34](9_0.htm#34)) Modify this template depending on what the patient wants to know and your own personal preferences. Keep your statements brief; and pause between statements so that patients can keep up with the flow. For example, \"I think you have a bladder infection. (pause) We'll send your urine sample to the lab to see what bacteria is causing it because this is the second infection you've had in a short period of time, and I want to be sure that I've given you the proper antibiotic, ok?(pause) You should start to feel better within 2 days, but if you're not, or you develop a fever please be sure to call me. (pause) Meanwhile, drink plenty of fluids and I'll call you when I get the culture report back.\" (pause) When you are about to provide information about several issues, let the patient know your organization at the beginning. For example, \"We'll need to talk about your diet, exercise, and insulin. I think it would be better to focus on your cholesterol at our next visit. Does that sound ok to you?\" |TELL: support the patient's prior successes| |Explicitly mention and appreciate patients' previous efforts and accomplishments in coping with previous problems or illness.| Reminding patients of previous successful efforts to cope with and manage illness supports their strengths and reinforces self-confidence and motivation. ( [35](9_0.htm#35)) Most patients can tell you of at least one successful coping strategy or accomplishment if you ask about them explicitly. Patients can draw upon their memories of prior successes to build future efforts. This is especially helpful in helping people change entrenched behaviors.( [36](9_0.htm#36)) You can then respond directly to patients' comments to acknowledge and support the attitudes, values, or strategies they found to be personally helpful in the past. |Check out the video example | about \"supporting the patient's prior successes\" on the left. \"You've been able to quit smoking in the past and that's an excellent predictor that you'll be successful again. Let's figure out what worked for you before.\" (pause, or ASK) \"You've really figured out a great system for recording your sugars and matching them with your symptoms. It's very helpful.\" (pause,or ASK) |TELL: personalize the information| | | Personalize your information by referring to the patient's personal and family history. \"We don't know if your dad had high blood pressure, but since he had a stroke in his 50's, it's likely that he did. It makes it even more important that we work together in keeping your blood pressure normal.\" (pause, or ASK) \"I know your wife and children mean a lot to you, and they need you. You've told me that you want to see your kids grow up. If we work together to keep your blood sugar normal, and you quit smoking, you have an excellent chance of living a healthy long life. What do you think?\" |TELL: Use simple language, avoid jargon| |Use simple language, avoid jargon.| Use simple, everyday language. In learning medicine, we are accustomed to complex sentences and long paragraphs. |Check out the video example | about \"using simple language amd avoiding jargon\" on the left. As clinicians, we tend to think in a multilayered fashion, exploring multiple diagnoses, diagnostic strategies and treatment options in our minds. Expressing all of these details can be confusing, or evoke alarm. Use simple sentences and short paragraphs. Words and phrases we take for granted, such as \"differential diagnosis\" or \"edema,\" are not necessarily familiar to patients. Take a moment to organize your thoughts and think about how to present information simply, clearly, and without using jargon. |TELL: Choose words that do not unnecessarily alarm| |Words and phrases we take for granted may be misinterpreted or alarm patients and families.| The words we use have a profound impact on sick and vulnerable patients and their families. Stories abound about the misuse of \"words that maim,\" such as referring to left coronary occlusions as \"the widow maker,\" or telling a patient, \"You're living on borrowed time.\"( [38](9_0.htm#38)) Patients' association of the word \"syndrome\" with Down's syndrome during genetics counseling discussions caused significant anxiety.( [37](9_0.htm#37)) Other commonly used words, such as, \"cervical incompetence\" or \"congestive heart failure\" may leave patients feeling somehow defective or at fault for their physical conditions. |Check out the video example | about \"choosing words that do not unnecessarily alarm\" on the left. It is important to provide explanations and information when we discuss diagnosis or prognosis, using commonly understood words like \"cancer\" or \"heart attack\" so that patients and families understand and can plan. |TELL: Use Visual Aids/ Share Supplemental Resources| |Find reliable resources and educational aids to meet the needs of your patients.| Use visual aids or draw pictures to illustrate your points (even if you have no \"artistic\" talent!). Engage your office staff or hospital team to help inform and motivate patients to utilize other resources. |Check out the video example | about \"sharing supplemental resources\" on the left. Supplement your conversations with other educational information, such as written flyers, audiotapes, audiovisual material, and computer-assisted instruction, including the internet. Refer patients to other providers for additional teaching and information. Help your patients locate and enroll in appropriate programs. Know what self-help groups are locally available to provide more information and support. Now that you have reviewed the components of TELL, you are ready to finish the sequence, as you attend to checking how the patients are receiving your sharing of information. |ASK: Continue to assess needs, comprehension and concerns| |After each bit of telling, stop and check in with patients. When you think you are about finished, make a final check. (below) This step closes the feedback loop with patients, and you will understand what patients hear, whether they are \"taking home\" the messages you intended and how they are feeling about the situation. (You are preparing the ground for Reaching Agreement (Module 11,) and Providing Closure (Module 12)).| The second ASK section consist of the following items: Patients may face external obstacles as well as internal emotional responses that inhibit them from overcoming these obstacles. |ASK: Check for patients' comprehension| | | ASK about your patients' understanding. This ASK improves patient recall, satisfaction, and adherence. Up to 40% of patients have problems recalling what was said during medical encounters.( [39-41](9_0.htm#39)) Checking for patients' understanding aids patient recall and satisfaction with the interview.( [42,44](9_0.htm#42)) |Check out the video example | about \"checking for patients' comprehension\" on the left. Checking for understanding during discussions leading to decisions was rare in a study of audio-taped medical office visits, occurring in a mere 2% of them.( [43](9_0.htm#43)) A study of videotaped preoperative cardiac surgery discussions showed that checking on patients' understanding by physicians, nurses or health educators occurred in 0.9-1.3% of discussions.( [44](9_0.htm#44)) Audiotapes of encounters with low literacy patients with diabetes showed that physicians checked for recall and comprehension in less than 16% of visits after presenting a new concept, and, glycemic control improved when physicians' did assess understanding.( [45](9_0.htm#45)) Some clinicians ask their patients to \"teach back\" what they have learned. This may be especially effective for patients with low literacy who cannot rely on written reminders.( [34](9_0.htm#34)) It is important to normalize the process and put the burden on your own shoulders: \"I always check in with my patients to make sure that I've explained things clearly. Can you tell me how you're going to take this new medicine?\" If the patient's explanation is incorrect, you should then say, \"I'm sorry, I guess I didn't explain things all that well: let me try again.\" Then go over the information again and ask the patient to teach it back to you again. In addition to asking patients to repeat back the most important information and instructions, it is important to encourage patients to voice their questions and concerns. It is best to do this before the end of the encounter when you have the time to address their questions, and to ask in and open ended manner. Instead of asking, \"do you have any questions?\" to which patients often reply, \"no,\" instead ask, \"What questions or concerns do you have?\" |ASK: Check for emotional responses and respond appropriately| | | Letting patients know that you have heard their concerns and worries is compassionate, improves outcomes and takes little time. Patients who are sick often feel vulnerable and afraid, and experience a sense of loss of control over their lives. Eliciting and responding to patients' feelings help them feel joined, supported and cared for. Many physicians try to express caring in their conversations with a thoughtful focus on the biomedical issues, but avoid talking about any associated feelings. This \"focus on facts\" fails to address patients' needs for emotional support. Patients appreciate being cared for as persons, not just as diseases. |Check out the video example | about \"checking for emotional responses and respond appropriately\" on the left. This very simple act improves outcomes and need not prolong visit times.( [46,47](9_0.htm#46)) When patients express emotion, either verbally or nonverbally, respond to them with skills we presented in Module 6: name or inquire about the patient's emotion; respond with legitimation or expressions of partnership, reassurance, support or praise. Check for emotional reactions: \"How are you feeling about all of this?\" \"Are you feeling nervous about your (test/surgery/chemotherapy)?\" |ASK: About barriers| | | Patients may face many barriers to ensuring health or coping with illness including lack of social support or financial resources, feelings of being overwhelmed, anxious or depressed and others. If you ask patients directly about the obstacles they perceive, you can help them being to think about strategies to overcome them. |Check out the video example | about \"asking about barriers\" on the left. \"Are there any barriers that you can see that might get in the way of your doing this?\" |SUMMARY| Clinicians can share information and build collaborative relationships by using specific communication strategies. Use ASK-TELL-ASK to stay in dialogue and to assess and respond to patients' information needs and emotions. (Use emotion-responding skills from Module 6.) Celebrate and support patients' successes. These efforts will help meet your patients' needs and improve their clinical outcomes. |BEHAVIOR SKILLS CHECKLIST| ASK to assess patient needs: 1. Make sure the setting is conducive. 2.

Assess Barriers |APPENDIX - Health Belief Model| | | Certain theories of patient health promoting behaviors are useful to know and can guide your counseling. For example, you could elicit and respond to patients' thoughts about the components of the Health Belief Model, as it applies in their situations. This model was designed to help explain why people undertake health promoting behaviors or comply with recommended treatments for illnesses. It asserts that patients' behaviors are related to certain perceptions and attitudes about health behaviors. This table summarizes the core concepts of the model: | | | | Definition | | Application | | Perceived Susceptibility |One's opinion of chances of getting a condition||Define population(s) at risk, risk levels. Personalize risk based on a person's features or behavior. Heighten perceived susceptibility if too low.| | | Perceived Severity |One's opinion of how serious a condition and its sequelae are||Specify consequences of the risk and the condition. Correct misperceptions, challenge patient denial.| | | Perceived Benefits |One's opinion of the efficacy of the advised action to reduce risk or seriousness of impact|| | Offer your opinion of the efficacy of the advised action to reduce risk or seriousness of impact Define action to take: how, where, when; clarify the positive effects to be expected from these actions. | | Perceived Barriers |One's opinion of the tangible and psychological costs of the advised action||Identify and reduce barriers through reassurance, incentives, assistance.| | | Cues to Action |Events, either bodily (e.g., physical symptoms of a health condition) or environmental (e.g., media publicity) that motivate people to take action.||Offer strategies to activate 'readiness.' Provide how-to information, promote awareness, reminders.| | | Self-Efficacy |Confidence in one's ability to take action||Provide training, guidance in performing action. Give positive feedback, support successes.| Adapted from: [http://www.comminit.com/changetheories/ctheories/changetheories-31.html](http://www.comminit.com/changetheories/ctheories/changetheories-31.html) |LITERATURE Lown, MD | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Author: | | |Rationale| | | by | | Reaching agreement is a complex process that includes identifying the nature of the problem, defining preferred roles and involvement in decision making, agreeing on goals, and gathering and sharing biomedical and psychosocial information. Participants in this process must address feelings, concerns, and preferences, while building consensus and collaborating to create shared decisions. Checking for mutual understanding helps to clarify and confirm agreement. After you have elicited the patient's history, completed the physical exam and formulated your thoughts about the patient's problems and how to manage them, the next step is discussing your ideas with patients, listening to their ideas, and reaching agreement about the plans. Without this critical step, patients in the hospital cannot know and have no say in what's happening or being done to them and why. Ambulatory patients face the same dilemma, but in this setting, the implementation of the plans rests in their hands. The way you go about reaching agreement with patients will reflect your beliefs about the roles of patient and clinician, and your approach to the patient-clinician relationship. |MODELS OF DECISION-MAKING BETWEEN PATIENTS AND CLINICIANS| | | Both patients and providers can be trained to enhance participatory styles of communication, resulting in improved health outcomes. Patients' involvement in decisions about their care is an increasingly important priority for healthcare providers, policy makers, medical organizations, and the public sector( [1-3](9_0.htm#01)). During recent decades, medical ethicists have emphasized the importance of patient autonomy and respect for the patient's right to self-determination( [4,5](9_0.htm#01)). Research contributions suggesting that patient participation enhances health outcomes have combined with these social forces to induce significant shifts in the patient-clinician relationship. Several paradigms help us conceptualize the nature of the decision making aspects of the clinician-patient relationship. In the \"paternalistic\" model, the beneficent clinician makes decisions on behalf of patients without including them. At the other end of the spectrum, in the \"informed consumer\" model, patients gather information from multiple sources, including from their clinicians in order to choose among available treatment options. In this model, the patient makes decisions independently and autonomously and the clinician's role is primarily as one source of information. In the \"professional as agent\" paradigm, clinicians make choices on behalf of patients based on what they know (or assume) about patients' preferences. In yet another model, \"collaborative,\" clinicians and patients share information and preferences and search for consensus about diagnostic and treatment decisions and plans ( [6](9_0.htm#06)). The latter model requires clinicians' willingness to collaborate, and patients' willingness to participate and assume shared responsibility for decisions. |Patient preferences and clinician communication behaviors| | | Patients want information but vary in their interest in actively collaborating in decisions. Clinicians are not good judges of their patients' preferences for decision-making. A 1980's Harris poll of patients and clinicians undertaken for a President's Commission for the study of ethical problems in medicine and biomedical research indicated that 72% percent of patients thought the patient and doctor should discuss alternatives about a clinical decision and decide together what to do( [7](9_0.htm#07)). Only 7% wanted the doctor to present alternatives and let the patient decide, and another 7% wanted the doctor to decide for them. Twelve percent wanted the doctor to present a recommendation for the patient to accept or reject. A later cross-national study of Australian, UK and US preferences also indicated that participants preferred mutual or joint decision-making( [8](9_0.htm#08)). Clinicians' communication practices have not kept pace with these patient preferences. A study of over one thousand audio taped office visits of US primary care physicians and surgeons showed that only 9% of decisions met criteria for fully informed decision-making ( [9](9_0.htm#09)). Another group studied \"routine\" clinical decisions and found that the most frequently discussed element (83% of discussions) was the nature of the problem, whereas discussions of risks and benefits and assessment of patient understanding were infrequent (9% and 2% of discussions respectively ( [10](9_0.htm#10))). Forty per cent of over 6,000 hospitalized patients in a recent nationwide survey said they did not have enough say in their in-hospital care ( [11](9_0.htm#11)). Most patients want information about their illnesses and decision options, but their preferences for participation in decision making are variable.( [12,13](9_0.htm#12)), Even those patients who wish to actively collaborate in decision making may not wish to do so in every instance, depending in part on the patient's age, culture, acuity, and severity of illness ( [14-16](9_0.htm#14)). Unfortunately, clinicians are often poor judges of their patients' preferences about participation in decision making ( [17](9_0.htm#17)). |Patient participation in decisions and health outcomes| | | Psychological and physical health, efficiency of care, and frequency of malpractice claims improve when patients are more involved in decisions about their care. Focused interventions, either with patients or their clinicians, enhance patient involvement in decision-making. Giving patients information and collaborating actively with them about their care enhances psychological and physical health outcomes. Stewart comprehensively summarized the evidence that four communication elements directly enhanced emotional and physical health, symptom resolution, and functional status. The four key elements included: Patients' perceptions of reaching agreement about clinical decisions have been correlated with improved efficiency of care, reflected by fewer diagnostic tests and referrals. ( [19](9_0.htm#19)). An intensive communication intervention for critically ill patients in which patients, families and the critical care team together discussed goals, expectations and care plans resulted in reduced ICU stays for patients who died, and in earlier access to palliative care for dying patients.( [20](9_0.htm#20)) Several studies have correlated malpractice claims with physician communication that failed to involve the patient in decisions about care. The communication problems cited included inadequate discussion of diagnosis or treatment plans, patients feeling ignored, and devaluing or failing to understand patient and family perspectives. ( [21](9_0.htm#21)) Communication skills training for patients or clinicians can enhance collaborative participation and clinical outcomes. Interventions with patients have included detailed review of their problems and individual coaching ( [22,23](9_0.htm#22)), provision of written information and verbal encouragement to participate in decisions to the extent desired ( [24,25](9_0.htm#24)), and provision of a communications training workbook prior to scheduled office visits( [26-28](9_0.htm#26)). The results of these interventions are enhanced participation in primary care interviews ( [27](9_0.htm#27)), assumption of a more active role in decision making ( [24,25](9_0.htm#24)), improved health outcomes (blood pressure and glucose control), and improved functional status ( [22,23](9_0.htm#22)). Studies of communication skills training interventions for health care providers (primarily primary care physicians) show increased focus on patients' preferences and shared control of clinical decisions with associated significant increases in patient satisfaction ( [29](9_0.htm#29)). |DOMAINS FOR REACHING AGREEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING WITH PATIENTS AND FAMILIES| |A collaborative approach to decision making requires the integration of the knowledge, values, needs and preferences of both patients and clinicians.| The clinical encounter is a \"meeting between experts( [30](9_0.htm#30)),\" to which patients bring expertise about their life context, concerns, beliefs and values, and clinicians bring biomedical and technical expertise. This collaborative, relationship-centered care approach requires mutual respect and willingness to share control and responsibility for decisions and plans. It is not an \"either/or\" approach, but a \"both/and\" approach( [31](9_0.htm#31)). The tasks of building, understanding and reaching agreement occur in the following key domains, and we describe communication skills within each of these domains in the following sections: |What is the nature of the problem?| | | It can be difficult to reach agreement about what should be done if you and the patient have different ideas about the nature of a problem. This aspect of finding common ground requires understanding the patient's explanatory model, including their perspective regarding the cause of the problem, its severity, and its expected course. |Mr. H. is a 32 year old construction worker whom you've seen once for an initial visit. He described occasional episodes of cramps and diarrhea, and a previous clinician had prescribed an antispasmodic agent for presumed irritable bowel syndrome. Mr. H. had no symptoms at the time of your visit and you suggested that he come in to see you if the symptoms reoccurred.| Mr. H: \"Hi Doc. Good to see you. Listen, I think my 'irritable bowel' problem is kicking up again. You know, that doctor that was here before you gave me a medicine for stomach spasms and I wondered if I could get some more. I've had a lot of diarrhea and cramps lately.\" Dr. D: \"Well, let's hear a bit more. Is anything different from previous episodes?\" Mr. H: \"Actually I've been seeing some blood mixed in with the stool and in the toilet water. I thought maybe I aggravated some hemorrhoids with all the diarrhea.\" Dr. D: \"Hm. How long has that been happening?\" Mr. H: \"Off and on for about 6-8 weeks I'd say.\" Dr. D: \"Ok, and are you having any pain in your belly?\" Mr. H: \"It comes and goes, but it feels kind of uncomfortable down low on the left a lot.\" Dr. D: \"I'll want you to show me where when I examine you. Now, my assistant recorded your weight as 157. That's down 8 pounds since I last saw you a few months ago.\" Mr. H: \"Yuh, I think what with the cramps and diarrhea I haven't felt much like eating.\" |In this vignette, Mr. H believes his symptoms are due to irritable bowel syndrome. He minimizes the significance of the blood in the stool, pain, and weight loss, perhaps due to anxiety, denial or inadequate knowledge about their significance.| Dr. D: \"So it sounds like you're thinking that these symptoms are due to irritable bowel syndrome and hemorrhoids?\" Mr. H: \"That's what I was thinking I guess why, what do you think?\" Dr. D: \"I'm concerned that there might be more going on. Irritable bowel does not usually cause bloody diarrhea, localized pain and weight loss.\" Mr. H: \"What do you think is going on?\" Dr. D: \"I'm not sure. The symptoms you describe may be caused by patches of inflamed bowel, chronic infection, sometimes even a tumor. We 'll need more information to make good decisions about treatment. I think we should do some tests to see if you have an area of bleeding in the bowel.. What are you thinking about all of this?\" Mr. H: \"Like what kinds of tests?\" | | As the conversation progresses, Dr. D ask about the patient's understanding, needs and feelings about the problem (see doc.com module 9) then begins to share information and answer questions (see module 10). If Dr. D advises a procedure without trying to reach common ground on the nature and implications of the patient's symptoms, Mr. H may feel confused, angry, or compelled into an action plan he doesn't understand and isn't ready to accept. Dr. D's task now is to share additional information about the significance of Mr. H's symptoms, and how the tests will help establish a diagnosis. The patient and clinician may not fully agree, but if they respect each other's explanations, it may be possible to integrate, or to try parallel approaches to the diagnostic or treatment plans. |What are the preferred roles of the participants in decision making?| | | Patients' preferences may change in different situations, so it's important to ask explicitly about their preferences for participating in decision-making. Sharing responsibility for decisions does not mean abandoning the patient. When clinicians express their opinions, give advice, and offer guidance, patients feel supported and clinicians fulfill their professional responsibilities. ( Some patients want their clinicians to make decisions for them, while others want to act independently. Patients who want the clinician to make decisions for them however, will usually engage in conversations about their goals for health and quality of life in illness. Ultimate choices belong to the fully informed patients. ( [33](9_0.htm#33)) However, this does not mean that clinicians should abandon patients as they make decisions. Clinicians are responsible for continuing to actively participate in their patients' care and follow-up while patients are responsibile for implementing agreed upon plans once they leave the hospital or office setting. At times full agreement cannot be reached. If the disagreement is serious, the patient and clinician may have to decide whether or not to continue their relationship. Fortunately, this is an infrequent occurrence. Dr. D: \"We can do simple blood tests and send a stool specimen to the lab, and I'd like you to see a gastroenterologist to look inside the bowel directly.\" Mr. H: \"Do you really think that's necessary? I thought this was a flare up of these old problems.\" Dr. D: \"Well, that may be, but I wouldn't want to assume your symptoms are due to irritable bowel and hemorrhoids until we exclude other problems. What questions do you have at this point?\" Mr. H: \"I understand that we need to figure out what's going on. I just don't like the idea of it. I'd like to speak with my brother about it. He's a doctor.\" Dr. D: \"I'd be happy to speak with your brother if you'd like. How are you feeling right now?\" Mr. H: \"Anxious.\" Dr. D: \"What concerns you the most? Mr. H: \"Could this be a cancer, Doc?\" Dr. D: \"I can understand your worry about that. I am concerned, too, but we don't know enough at this point, and we will discuss your lab results as they emerge. How can I be most helpful to you right now?\" Mr. H: \"I just need to think about this.\" Dr. D: \"Ok. How shall we make a decision about what to do next?\" Mr. H: \"How about if I give you a call in a couple of days.\" Dr. D: \"That sounds fine.\" |Mr. H. indicates he is willing to listen to Dr. D's advice, but also wants to participate in the decision making by weighing the necessity for a referral, and by speaking with trusted advisors. He also needs time to absorb the information about the potential seriousness of his symptoms before he can agree on a diagnostic plan. Dr. D for his part, must realize that he has just shared difficult news, and respect the patient's need for time to think and to seek additional advice, without feeling that his authority is being challenged.| Other strategies that Dr. D could try in clarifying the role Mr. H would like to play in making decisions about tests and management options include: |Check out the video example | about \"decision making\" on the left. Sometimes clinicians and patients desire the input of others, such as consultants or the patient's significant others. Strategies that Dr. D could try include: |Check out the video example | about \"consultation\" on the left. |What are the goals of treatment?| | | Patients' goals may change as they live through an illness. This observation, and the fact that clinicians are inadequate judges of patients' preferences, highlights the necessity to revisit the complex decisions about diagnosis and treatment as time goes by. After sharing information to understand each other's definition of the problem, the next step is establishing mutual understanding of the patient's and clinician's goals for a proposed diagnostic or treatment plan. Deber makes the distinction between patient's desires to participate in decisions by weighing values and alternatives, versus \"problem-solving\" or making technical decisions about which specific tests or treatments are medically likely to clarify or resolve a problem. She postulates that most patients want to participate in weighing decisions, but not in deciding the technical aspects of care. (33) Quill and Brody also advise clinicians to focus first on overall goals, rather than technical or specific aspects of treatment. Clarifying the goals |Check out the video example | about \"clarifying the goals of treatment\" on the left. |Mr. P. was an elderly successful businessman recently diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer. Mr. P. asked his family and Dr. L. to sustain him with whatever treatments his clinicians thought indicated until his quality of life or clarity of mind were compromised, at which time he preferred to be kept comfortable. He remained functional for a few weeks until his wife noticed that he was having word-finding difficulty. Dr. L. then noted brain metastases and initiated radiation, anticonvulsant, and steroid therapy. Mr. P. agreed, but by the 3rd hospital day, he was exhausted and asked for a respite from radiation treatments. The house staff noted his limited oral intake and abnormal electrolytes, renal and liver function.| Resident W: \"Hi Mr. P. Your labs look like you're dehydrated and your nutrition is poor. I'm going to start a long intravenous line so we can give you some fluids and total parenteral nutrition.\" Mr. P. said quietly, \"Why? It's too late for that. I don't want any of this. I want to go home.\" | | Strategies to help establish the patients goals of health and illness management include: |What is to be done?| | | The first tenet of a shared decision is that it must meet the goals agreed upon by both patient and clinician. The processes involved in reaching such an agreement are the following: The processes of gathering and sharing information, building consensus, and reaching agreement are complex, and are sometimes daunting because of the nature of clinical uncertainty ( [36](9_0.htm#36)). Clinical uncertainties make communication of risk to patients extremely complex and difficult. The way professionals frame information about risks and benefits greatly affects how patients receive and act upon this information. For example, positive framing spoken in terms of chance of survival is more persuasive in encouraging patients to take risky options than negative framing spoken in terms of chance of death ( [37](9_0.htm#37)). The skills to accomplish this are always relevant, and the conversation may be elaborated or truncated according to the complexity of the decision. In the face of urgent decisions, clinicians are likely to give too much information too quickly, and to attempt to persuade patients instead of helping them reach the best decision. Having a skill set and strategies available is essential to reaching agreement with patients. The chart below provides a guideline of communication skills for reaching agreement, with examples of clinician statements and questions to implement the skills. |Skills guideline||Skills examples| |Present options including the proposed plans/procedure, it's risks, benefits, and alternatives.

Right now, I see you are not ready to make a decision yet.\"| Clinicians see the problems, pain and suffering that may arise if urgent measures are delayed by patients' ambivalence or reluctance Because we wish to spare patients as much suffering as possible, we may try to explain too much, give too much information and fail to appreciate patients' decision dilemmas. We may marshal as much evidence for our recommendation as possible, trying to persuade the patient to do the \"right thing\" especially if we foresee dire consequences. The communication dynamic becomes distorted because patients cannot absorb excessive information, and too much persuasion tends to result in resistance. These communication dilemmas can be repaired by listening and responding to patients' views instead of repeating, reconfiguring or bolstering our own. Our professional obligation is to integrate our own expertise and preferences with our patients' so that they can live their lives, and make decisions as they see fit. |How will the plans be implemented?| | | Patients live in their own worlds where decisions are activated only if they choose and are able to implement the plans. The realities of daily living and contextual factors alter patients' readiness to contemplate the changes necessary for self-care, and their ability to carry them out. It's important to reiterate the agreed upon plans, to check for mutual understanding, and probe whether the patient is able to implement them. Sometimes, the patient simply is not able to follow through with the agreed upon plans. Mrs. N. incurred an ankle injury when she was running across a playground to reach her toddler. Her physician found a severe sprain, and prescribed ice, leg elevation, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and crutches. She returned a week later with continued pain and swelling. Her physician asked if she had followed instructions, and she replied that she had not. When asked, she explained that she waitresses during the day while her son stays with a neighbor. Her family lives in Canada. After work it is impossible to elevate her leg or use crutches as she either used the stroller or carried her son when outside, and inside he is \"all over the place!\" She felt embarrassed to share this and feared that her physician would interpret her reluctance as a rejection of his advice. |Skills guideline||Skills examples| |Check for mutual understanding|| | \"Just so I can be sure I've been clear, let's summarize the plans.\" |Check for readiness, barriers and need for additional resources||\"How ready do you feel to pursue this plan?\" | \"What problems do you anticipate in carrying out these plans?\" \"What resources might be helpful?\" In situations like Mrs. N's, the clinician's responsibility is to continue to be supportive, provide information, identify barriers and problem-solve with the patient. The clinician may identify other professionals to serve as resources, such as patient educators and social workers. Similarly, the patient may identify family or friends as resources and supports. |Check out the video example on the left.| | | Dr. A, the primary care clinician for 43 year old Mr. W., made the diagnosis of Hepatitis C. She frequently urged him to stop drinking alcohol, explaining that alcohol hastens progression to cirrhosis. Mr. W. did not agree that his six beers nightly was a problem, after all he had his job and no legal or other difficulties, and his wife drank with him. Dr. A. inquired periodically about his thoughts and feelings about drinking, continuing to share her concern that alcohol was harmful for his health. One day, 5 years after he entered her practice, he told her he had quit drinking. \"Why now?\" asked Dr. A. \"Because I was ready, my wife quit, and you told me to,\" he replied. Clinicians should look at inability to follow through with agreed plans as a signal to reappraise the feasibility of the decisions made, rather than labeling the patient as \"non-compliant.\" When this occurs, the patient and clinician should identify barriers to implementation, problem-solve together, and identify available resources and other people to help. Additional communication skills are applicable in situations where patients chronically fail to implement plans (see module 16), or cannot agree with a diagnosis (especially stigmatized diagnoses, like alcoholism (see module 29), depression (see module 27) or HIV infection. |SUMMARY| | | Reaching agreement is a complex process that begins with identifying the nature of the problem, defining preferred roles and involvement in decision making, and agreeing on goals for the next steps. It also includes gathering and sharing information about biomedical knowledge, feelings, concerns, and preferences, toward building consensus and collaborating to create shared decisions. The clinician and patient work toward mutual understanding. In the collaborative model, inability of patients to follow agreed upon plans signals the need for reassessment of prior decisions, rather than labels of noncompliance. Clinicians can enhance their patients' clinical outcomes and satisfaction by using this collaborative Lown, MD | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Author: | | |Rationale| | | by | Closing an interview is a complex endeavor, and your success depends both on your skillful approach to preceding interview segments and the skills you employ in the closing moments. The closure of any patient encounter includes specific behaviors and interactions that influence the patient's implementation of plans, the patient's health, and the patient-clinician relationship. ( [1,2](9_0.htm)) Yet, studies indicate that the closing moments of an encounter are quite brief. In one study, visits averaged 16.8 minutes and in 72% of them, closure lasted less than 1 minute.( [3](9_0.htm)) Effective beginnings facilitate successful completions, so your skillful execution of earlier interview segments greatly facilitates effective closure. |WHY DOES CLOSURE DIFFER FROM SHARING AND PLANNING, AND WHEN DOES CLOSURE BEGIN?| | | As the end of the visit approaches, conversation turns from the present to the future. The challenge is achieving clear agreement on what happens next. Use the skills of summarizing, clarifying, expressing supporting, and saying goodbye. Closure is the time for checking and reviewing plans, expressing support, and saying goodbye. In actual interviews, a demarcation line between reaching agreement on plans and closure of the interview is seldom clear. At the close of visits the conversation shifts from a present to a future orientation, and the clinician and patient confirm that they each understand and agree about what will happen next. ( [4](9_0.htm)) The tasks of closure include orienting the patient to the close of the visit, summarizing, reviewing and checking the diagnostic or treatment plans for understanding, clarifying and arranging follow-up, and acknowledging, reassuring or supporting the patient before saying goodbye. ( [3](9_0.htm)) |Problem: Interrupted or prolonged closures| | | Welcome explorations of new topics early in interviews, but toward the end, keep invitations to explore new material to a minimum in order to efficiently bring the interview to a close. Certain clinician behaviors prolong closure; such as eliciting new concerns during closure rather than earlier in the interview, ( [4](9_0.htm)) or failing to reach common ground on an issue with a patient. Prolonged closures are less likely when you take time at the beginning to orient patients to the flow of the visit, to elicit concerns, to give adequate information about treatment plans, to explore patients' beliefs, and to respond to patients' feelings. ( [3](9_0.htm)) If you or your patients introduce new or unresolved issues late in the interview, this action prolongs or interrupts effective closure. Often patients fail to disclose the issues that are really bothering them until they perceive that their physician is starting to close the interview. Usually, these \"hidden agendas\" appear because they are difficult psychosocial concerns or physical symptoms that cause the patient anxiety, or are known to be associated with potentially serious implications, such as chest pain.( [6](9_0.htm)) Sometimes new issues arise late because they emerge as the conversation evolves, or because the patient or clinician simply forgot about something. This \"Oh, by the way .\" phenomenon is frustrating because seldom does sufficient time remain for thoughtful evaluation of late topics. ( [3](9_0.htm)) When new issues arise late in the interview, you may need to return to earlier phases of the interview, such as exploring the history, sharing information, and reaching agreement about new plans, particularly if the new information is clinically important. This tends to interrupt or prolong closure. If a new issue is not pressing, both patient and physician may agree to bring it up at a later visit. Positive social talk, chatting, laughing, expressing concern, and sharing personal information at the end of a visit may also prolong closure, which is not to say that this is \"bad!\" This portion of the interaction is when the patient and physician get to relax and connect on a personal level after the \"business\" of the encounter is completed. ( [3, 4](9_0.htm)) |Preventing closure problems| | | Use effective interview skills early in interviews to avoid common closure problems. Then transition to specific closing strategies and skills, such as, alerting patients that your time together is drawing to a close, summarizing plans and arranging follow up. Specific clinician behaviors enacted before the closing phase of the interview help to facilitate effective and uninterrupted closures. These include: ( [4,5,7](9_0.htm)) Skills that facilitate smooth and effective closure include: |Case: Learner B. and Mrs. D:| | | The learner prepares a smooth pathway towards uninterrupted closure of her hospital visit, and then includes in her closure a summary of what to expect, how to get in touch, confirmation of the next contact time, and a departing salutation. Learner B. is concluding her admission interview with Mrs. D for diabetes and cellulitis which is not responding to oral antibiotics. | | Moving toward closure: Learner B: \"So it sounds like you understand that we admitted you to the hospital because the infection and swelling in your leg seemed to be getting worse in spite of the antibiotics. We'll also adjust your insulin. I think the resident explained that we plan to do an ultrasound on your leg to be sure there are no blood clots in your leg that could be contributing to the swelling around your ankle, right?\" Transition and closure: Learner B: \"Ok, that's fine. I'm finished for now, but I'll be in the hospital if you want to page me when he comes.\" In this dialogue, the student checks on the patient's understanding of the reasons for admission, shares information about what to expect next, asks about the patient's beliefs about what caused her illness, and elicits her questions and concerns three times before she effectively transitions into closure. Learner B's use of these skills permits her to effectively close with a brief summary of what to expect, how to get in touch, confirmation of the next contact time, and a departing salutation. |CLOSURE OF BRIEF PATIENT-CLINICIAN RELATIONSHIPS| | | Clinicians must frequently say goodbye to patients, and sometimes you may feel sad about the separation from the intimacy of these relationships, even if the time spent has been (relatively) short. At all stages of training and practice you will say goodbye to many patients whom you know you will not see again. This will happen in the hospital and emergency room, with consultations and brief surgeries, when cross-covering for colleagues, with clinic patients who are relocating out of town, and with patients who are terminally ill and dying. (Termination of extended clinician-patient relationships will be addressed in Module 36, and saying goodbye to a dying patient in Module 31) Patients are admitted and discharged quickly from the hospital these days. However, the patients' hospitalization is the only one they are experiencing and it is a traumatic life event that is accompanied by worry and fears. Patients need to connect with you despite short stays, and especially will appreciate expressions of caring during the time you spend with them. Taking a moment to acknowledge the person, to wish him or her well, and to say goodbye is an expression of respect, and a symbolic marker that the hospitalization experience has concluded. This small gesture of compassion can have a very large effect, and help patients accommodate to illness and move forward into life. |CONCLUSION| Effectively closing the encounter depends on both your closing skills and the preparation you do earlier in the visit. By soliciting patients' complete agenda at the beginning, attending to verbal and nonverbal clues of patient concerns throughout the encounter, and reaching agreement, the clinician sets the stage for successful closure. Whether completing a visit or terminating a relationship, the skills of closure will guide you through successful completion of your encounters. |BEHAVIOR SKILLS CHECKLIST| |LITERATURE REFERENCES| |Welcome to doc.com Module strong emotions: Sadness, Anger, Fear |by Barry Egener, MD | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Author: | | 2.0 - 7/8/2009 upgrade to doc.com version 4.0 1.2 - 7/1/2009 revision by Barry Egener 1.1 - 6/10/2007 revision by Geoffrey Gordon 1.0 - 6/27/2005 |Rationale| During the medical interview patients' strong emotions tend to elicit strong emotions in their physicians. Depending on physicians' skill and self-awareness, those emotions can lead to productive exploration of important clinical issues, or they can threaten therapeutic relationships. This module will describe concepts and skills that help you to respond to patients' intense expressions of sadness, fear, or anger in ways that not only promote patients' healing, but also enhance your own self-awareness and Emotions| | | We often notice strong emotions in patients, but sometimes are so caught up in an interaction that we fail to recognize or respond to patients' emotions (or our own emotions) until we look back on the interaction or notice the residual impact on ourselves. |Sadness, Fear, and Anger| | | The emotions of sadness, fear, and anger all have their origin in the experience or anticipation of loss. In the medical interview, each of these emotions can have their source either in the patient, the physician, or in the interaction between them. We don't generally associate anger with loss, but when angry, you can uncover this relationship by asking yourself the question, \"What might this person (or situation) cause me to lose?\" What functions do these emotions serve? All these emotions have evolved in humans and other species because they confer some survival advantage. Research in wild chimpanzees has demonstrated advantages to the capacity to read emotions as well as disastrous social consequences of the inability to do so. Similarly, people have evolved the capacity to \"read\" others' emotions because to do so confers an advantage. Outside of medicine \"emotional intelligence\" (EQ) may correlate better with job and marital success than intelligence quotient (IQ). Recently the neurobiological mechanism for empathy may have been discovered. \"Mirror neurons\" have been identified which register observed behavior in the cortex. This provides the opportunity for humans to internally \"rehearse\" the observed experience of another, even if the action is not expressed. (Similarly dreamed actions are suppressed while sleeping.) While the potential to experience another's experience may exist, the degree to which clinical empathy depends on this mirroring remains a research question. (See section below on the interview as healing experience.) Speculating on the biology of the emotions is beyond the purpose of this module, but it is important to appreciate that emotions have effects both on the self and on others. There are neurohumoral effects that may be beneficial (such as preserving or mobilizing physiologic resources) or dysfunctional (such as clinical depression). And there are effects on others that can be both helpful (such as engendering the desire of others to assist) and harmful (such as provoking anger). Awareness of emotions and the ability to recognize them in other people confers the power to react mindfully rather than reflexively. Thoughtful responses are productive for the patient and satisfying for the clinician, whereas reflex reactions retard rapport and limit healing. |Physician Emotions| |Exploring your own emotions that arise in treating patients promotes your professional growth. Most of us are very sensitive to some emotions, and less sensitive to others. You can be a more flexible and effective clinician by becoming more aware of your own blind spots and \"hot buttons\".| Emotions are \"contagious\" Physicians may resonate with patients' anger or sadness and thus feel the same emotion. Or a patient's emotion may evoke a different emotion in a physician, e.g., patient sadness may induce physician anger. Also, a physician may experience an emotion when the patient is not manifesting any emotion. The range of responses to patients is as rich as the diversity of human experience, upbringing, culture, and personality. While our own emotions may provide clues to what the patient is feeling, there is nevertheless a differential diagnosis of physician emotion just as the emotions may have many sources in the patient, the same may be said of the physician. These factors combine to attune us differently to emotions there is no \"correct\" or \"best\" response. |Making emotions work for you| |Empathic responses acknowledge patients' emotions or experiences, and show your interest in understanding them.| If emotions are unpleasant or if we lack confidence in our ability to respond to them, we may try to ignore or distance ourselves from them. Seeing the patient as the source of our discomfort can make a therapeutic alliance difficult. Skillful exploration of patients' emotions, which enables you to understand their situations and increases your capacity for caring, is the main tool in overcoming barriers such as a lack of confidence or discomfort. Seeing the patient as suffering from the emotion rather than being the source of our own unpleasant feeling rekindles a therapeutic instinct. Reminding ourselves that the patient's behavior is separate from the patient as a person creates professional objectivity. Further, your exploration usually enhances patients' capacity for healing, as well as their capacity for optimism and for taking effective action. For me, understanding the patient's experience is how I overcome the feeling that the patient is a challenge sitting on the other side of the table. It helps me feel that the patient and I are together on the same side of the table, with his uncomfortable experience on the other side. The main therapeutic tool is your empathic response to patients' strong emotions. Let's define empathy as most scholars do, as a cognitive awareness of another person's experience, state, or emotion. Your empathic responses communicate this understanding. The responses show your patients that you are aware of their experiences. Actively demonstrating your understanding builds trust and safety into the relationship. In turn, trust helps patients share more information, and cooperate better with plans and treatments. Data from many sources within medicine, across diverse cultures and in fields such as psychology, education and the arts demonstrate that failing to respond to strong emotions in an empathic manner makes people feel they are not valued, ignored, not understood or not cared for by the listener. The interview itself can become a healing experience because being understood is therapeutic. You do not need to actually experience the emotion of the patient to imagine how the patient feels. And, to be sure, people debate about how much emotional connection between patients and physicians is optimal. Too much detachment risks a loss of rapport; loss of boundaries risks a loss of therapeutic agency. My opinion and experience is that it is not necessary to feel what the patient is feeling in order to be therapeutic. However, as discussed above, when I do experience emotion in an interview, I find it useful to become curious about why this is so (see \"Professional growth\", below). This module demonstrates application of empathy skills to situations in which emotions are strong. Because of the intensity of the feelings, these could be considered high stakes situations. Nevertheless, empathy skills are the same in simple situations and in emotionally intense ones. Many learners worry that the purpose of empathy skills and empathic responding is manipulative. The aim is, emphatically, not to maneuver the patient into another state or perspective desired by the clinician, no matter how benevolent the goal. Rather, the purpose is to become more transparent, to make a genuine clinical understanding more visible to the patient, to build alliance, safety, and trust. Just as any skill is initially awkwardly performed (think of your first ski run, your first attempt at the Moonlight Sonata, or your first souffl\u00e9!), skills become easier with practice, and in many situations even automatic. Increasing the range of situations in which you can respond with empathy is not only possible, it is a process that is essential throughout your career, from student to seasoned clinician. The illustrations in these chapters are necessarily those of the author, albeit informed by the Kalamazoo consensus and other evidence-based sources. They may feel foreign to you your task is to find personal words that genuinely communicate your attempts to understand patients' experience. Whatever your words, and however awkward or unskilled you feel, if you are genuine in your intention to understand, your attempt will be helpful. First, your empathic non-verbal cues (m14) will be apparent to patients, and secondly, if they misunderstand you are likely to see those signals and have another chance to clarify your intent and express your caring. If your goal were to manipulate, the skills would be inflammatory; if your goal is to communicate genuine thoughts and feelings, no matter how awkwardly expressed, the patient is likely to be appreciative. |Responding to Strong Emotions| | | Exploring the emotion accomplishes all three functions of the medical interview: data gathering, relationship-building, and collaborative planning for diagnosis and treatment. In this section, I will briefly discuss: Although clinicians use judgment in deciding when and how to respond to emotions when they arise in the interview, choosing not to explore emotions that are strongly expressed will usually be destructive to the therapeutic relationship, since a strongly expressed emotion will be apparent and can only be ignored by choice. Ignoring feelings communicates that the physician does not care about the emotion or considers it not important or relevant to the interview. This greatly diminishes the therapeutic effectiveness of the physician (Module 3). In reality, physicians commonly disregard emotions, sometimes because they think they lack the skills to manage the interview, either in terms of time or emotions, and sometimes because they cannot shift their focus from the biologic aspects of the situation back to the person. Studies have shown that addressing emotions helps shorten the interview and build trust, in both surgical and primary care visits. I believe that the explanation for the time saving effects of the empathy skills lies in the patient's persistent attempt to become known as a person, and to communicate important personal needs, values, concerns, and beliefs before proceeding to biomedical concerns. Skillful use of empathy skills allows the physician to integrate caring for the person with caring for biomedical concerns, as she accomplihshes data gathering, relationship-building, and therapeutic goals. |Intense Sadness| | | Extreme sadness may be non-verbally apparent as the physician enters the room the patient may be crying, withdrawn, or staring at the floor. The physician cannot initially know whether the experience of loss relates to a health concern, a social issue, depression or something else. Giving the patient control over whether and how to discuss the emotion will also give the patient some control of the emotion. Thus it can be empowering for the physician to simply notice the sadness with reflection. |\"You seem sad (upset or down) today.\"|| | Reflection As with all the emotions we will discuss in this chapter, some calibration may be necessary. For example, for a patient who is withdrawn, the statement above brings the emotion into the interview and signals that you intend to address it. However, for a patient who is sobbing, the emotion is already present, and the statement above is too tame. Thus, inviting the patient to explain the emotion is a better approach. | | \"Can you tell me what is upsetting you?\" Some explanation will follow. When the physician has some notion of the cause, validating the patient is the critical next step. (Sometimes the skill of validation is called legitimation.) Validation demonstrates the clinician's understanding of the reason for the emotion. |\"Losing your job when your husband has been out of work must be very upsetting.\"|| | Validation |\"It's terrible to lose a child. Anyone would be terribly distraught.\"|| | Validation The empathy skills support and partnership offer some help or relief from suffering. Support acknowledges a distressing circumstance. |\"The last few months of your wife's illness have been really difficult.\"|| | Support Partnership specifically offers the clinician's assistance in a distressing circumstance. |\"Let's figure out a couple of options for how to help you feel better, to see what choices fit you best.\"|| | Partnership Lastly, respect for the patient's emotional strength can help bolster those resources. |\"I'm impressed with how you've coped with such a devastating loss.\"|| | Respect Because responding to emotions with empathic communication powerfully signals to the patient the physician's interest in staying in relationship even in the presence of strong emotions, we discuss this dynamic in many modules, and notably in M 6, on Building Relationship. The need for clarity during discussion of medical topics sometimes distracts physicians from responding to the patient's sadness or other emotions. The mnemonic PEARLS, representing Partnership, Empathy, Apology (or Appreciation), Respect, Legitimation, and Support helps many clinicians find words to respond in complex or stressful situations. |Intense Sadness: other considerations| Many (but by no means all) people who suffer a significant loss or illness will develop clinical depression. Whenever strong sadness is present, the clinician should screen for the presence of major depression. In extreme sadness, the clinician should explore the patient's capacity for self-care (or intent for self-harm) and access to a support system: friends, relatives, faith, and other practitioners. Self-awareness is critical not only for the self-care and growth of the clinician but also to be maximally effective with the patient. How a physician's own emotional state will be affected by a distraught patient will have been to some extent conditioned by the clinicians' formative life experiences as well as by similar previous clinical encounters. One common response would be personal sadness. The self-aware physician will consider the possibility that his own sadness is a diagnostic clue to the presence of sadness or depression in the patient. [ [see Physician Emotions](1_2.htm)]. |Intense Anger| | | Anger is a normal response to perceived threat but can be counter-productive when it alienates those who might help. Further, if physicians respond with defensive or retaliatory statements or questions, patients' anger may actually increase. Remember this key factor: you can express your understanding without agreeing with patients. Patients may express anger toward clinicians for many reasons, including: |Click the picture above to see a movie portraying poor communication with an angry patient.||Click the picture above to see a movie portraying better communication with an angry patient.| Most physicians find it difficult to try to understand and to express empathy with patients by whom we feel attacked, but the same skills useful in other situations are equally useful here. As with sadness, stating your empathy with angry patients may require calibration. For example, when the patient is \"simmering\" with anger but doesn't feel that it's appropriate to reveal the anger, reflection will help bring the upset into the interview, where it can be addressed: |\"You seem angry. Have I done something to upset you?\"|| | Reflection However, the same statement would seem foolish, sarcastic, or belittling to a patient who is yelling at the clinician. Here, there is no need to bring the emotion into the open, since it is already present. Validation would be more appropriate: |\"Anyone would be upset after being kept waiting in a cold room dressed in a flimsy gown.\"|| | Validation Clinicians are often reluctant to validate (or legitimize) a patient's anger for fear of \"adding fuel to the fire.\" But especially because not feeling heard often arouses patients' anger, legitimizing (validating) the feeling is helpful, not harmful. The \"I can understand that you. . . .\" language enables a clinician to validate a patient while not necessarily agreeing with the patient: |\"I can understand that you would be upset with me for not prescribing the Vicodin\u00ae, when that's the main reason you came in today.\"|| | Validation | | YOU DON'T HAVE TO AGREE TO EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING! It is still possible to support a patient who is angry: |\"It's difficult to care so much and feel that you can't control what happens.\"|| | Support |\"Let's see if there's another way I can help address your concerns; or perhaps others on the health care team can assist us.\"|| | Partnership When the disagreement transpires within acceptable bounds, respecting the autonomy of the patient can de-escalate anger: |\"Even though I'd prefer that you agree with the team's recommendation, I respect that you need to advise your mother of what you consider to be in her best interest.\"|| | Respect One of the challenges of dealing with intense anger is balancing empathy with enough \"detachment\" to remain professional. The patient's anger may or may not be directly towards us personally, but feeling personally attacked can make us defensive. And acting defensive worsens the situation, because it escalates rather than de-escalates the emotion. Sometimes it helps to remind ourselves that although patients' anger may be directed at us, its origin may lie in the patient's circumstances. In other words we're not responsible for the patient's anger or for \"fixing\" it. However, we do help patients when we take the time to become mindful of their pain or loss and genuinely attempt to make an empathic statement despite feeling attacked. |Intense Anger: other considerations| There are times when it is appropriate to place boundaries on the patient's anger, when you would choose not to empathize, such as when the patient is so upset that he cannot listen, when the patient has lost control, or when he threatens the safety of those around him. The best way to place limits on the patient is to describe the conditions in which you are willing to continue to engage him. This gives the patient the choice of whether to de-escalate the confrontation and continue to be heeded or, alternatively, to lose his audience and certain other freedoms: \"I'm willing to continue this conversation so long as you exhibit the same respect towards me that I am giving you.\" If disregarded, your own limit-setting should escalate: \"If you continue to disrupt our ability to conduct care safely in this clinic, I will need to call Security.\" If the patient continues to be disruptive, it's best not to continue to engage him. Doing so may indeed \"fuel the fire.\" In such situations, it is appropriate to leave the room, to hang up the telephone, or to call Security. Your own safety takes precedence over being therapeutic. Your own gut feeling about personal safety is generally reliable, and being attuned to a sense of danger is but another aspect of self-awareness. Exhibitions of extreme anger are unusual and may signal other feelings or diagnoses. For example, intense anger may be a way of insulating oneself from intense fear, such as that presented by a lethal diagnosis or a threat to one's child. Anger that might have been more moderately expressed can be dis-inhibited by alcohol and other drugs. Personality disorders and delusional thinking can manifest as extreme anger, so such demonstrations should prompt consideration of substance abuse, sociopathy or schizophrenia. Being the target of intense anger is always upsetting, and you are likely to feel shaken. Take a few moments to center yourself after such an encounter before moving on to other tasks and reflect on the experience, which may offer opportunities for growth. You could ask yourself, or discuss this with a trusted colleague: |Intense Fear| | | Medical events such as a motor vehicle accident or a worsening clinical situation precipitate intense fear. You can best assist patients who experience intense fear by helping them bring the fears into the interview where you can listen and show your understanding. We need to resist invoking false reassurance in order to minimize the patient's or our own discomfort. When a patient's fear is well-founded, false reassurance jeopardizes trust and undermines the therapeutic alliance. That alliance is what provides the leverage for supporting the patient. On the other hand, you should never diminish hope. Even when the most dire outcome, death, is certain, hope may be available in the manner or management of dying, in spiritual domains, and in the people and accomplishments left behind. Starting with what you observe may objectify an emotion of which the patient was consciously unaware: |\"You seem apprehensive.\"|| | Reflection Then explore the cause: |\"What worries you most about this illness? operation? dying?\" | \"What help would you like in order to deal with [whatever the patient names]?\" \"What worries you most about leaving your [significant other] behind?\" \"Have you spoken to her of your concerns? Are there ways you could provide for her?\" Many of the concerns patients will name can be addressed: The interview itself can offer several ways of helping the patient. Commonly, a sense of isolation, of having to face the unknown alone, intensifies fear. Feeling unattractive or tainted by illness can increase a sense of alienation. Sometimes the patient's specific fears are realistic and terrifying, such as the new diagnosis of a lethal disease. In these situations, the expression \"I wish it were different\" can support the patient by communicating caring, understanding and sharing the patient's perspective. Knowing that many others have been in the same position can help: |\"The experience of chemotherapy is scary for patients. They commonly think that others fear being around them.\" || | Validation |\"You're dealing with a lot right now.\" || | Support |\"And you're doing very well with it.\" || | Respect You can alleviate that sense of isolation by offering to refer the patient to a counselor, to a support group, or simply by proffering your own constant presence: |\"Whatever struggles you'll face with this illness, we'll go through them together.\" || | Partnership |Intense Fear: other considerations| Some patients' fear becomes a paralyzing terror, preventing them from making constructive steps. Anxiety is a psychobiologic consequence of fear. While anxiety can mobilize a patient to prevent or mitigate a feared event, severe anxiety may require psychiatric consultation or medication. If appropriate, a benzodiazepine can give the patient relief and a sense of control.(m25) Remember to screen for alcohol or other substance abuse before you offer this option. You confront your own existential fears through your patients' suffering and death. Many physicians in certain specialties encounter these challenging issues every day. You also bump up against your own limitations, which can precipitate a professional crisis. Reflecting upon these issues with colleagues lessens feelings of isolation, guilt, inadequacy and uncertainty which all caring professionals live with, and bringing fears into the open prevents burnout.(m4) No one is immune to these experiences--remember to share feelings with your colleagues and your team; their listening will help you at the same time it helps them. |CONCLUSIONS| Because patients regularly confront both real and apparent life-changing medical events, physicians will regularly encounter their patients' and their own strong emotions. These emotions are neither good nor bad they are simply facts, like the weather. And like the weather, they will change as circumstances evolve. |Both patients and physicians can become stuck in emotions, and overwhelmed by their force. At these times we must maintain our own professional equilibrium and use the skills that we have practiced in less challenging circumstances, particularly those empathy skills that communicate interest in the patient as a person.| The intensity of these moments can generate proportionally strong and rewarding relationships with patients. Similarly, such moments not only create professional challenges, they also engender personal and professional growth. |Behavior Checklist| |References| |Annotated Video| |Welcome without saying... |by Cecile A. Carson, MD and Jeannette M. Shorey II, MD | \u00a9 2005-2010 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Author: | | |Rationale| | | Cecile A. Carson, MD Just what is \"nonverbal communication\"? It is useful to think of it as all the behavioral signals that go on between interacting individuals, exclusive of the verbal content. When two or more of us are together, we human beings cannot fail to communicate at all times, even when we are silent. |The Patient's View| |The define \"nonverbal communication\" as all the behavioral signals that go on between interacting individuals, exclusive of the verbal content ( |The importance of nonverbal communication| | | Nonverbal communications are powerful and useful. The \"first impressions\" that we clinicians make of patients, and that patients make of us are based almost entirely on nonverbally communicated information. All of us are sending and receiving nonverbal messages all the time, at varying levels of subliminal and conscious awareness. Some of us naturally monitor the messages. All of us can learn to attend to them. Experts' estimates in the literature range widely, but on average, they teach us that 80% of all communication is nonverbal and involuntary, while 20% is verbal and under our conscious control. Important information - that cannot be hidden - is being exchanged nonverbally at all times from patient to clinician, and from clinician to patient. For both parties, the nonverbal channel carries the meaning of the message while the verbal channel carries the more concrete content of the message. There is much to be gained by tuning in to these nonverbal messages.( [2](9_0.htm#2)) This takes some practice, but once you become attentive and skillful, obtaining this valuable information takes no extra time. Evidence shows that nonverbal communication has significant influence on the important outcomes of patient satisfaction, adherence to medical advice, and even clinical response to treatments. ( [3,4](9_0.htm#3)) |Rapport| | | Rapport simply means \"I am with you,\" and is the nonverbal structure of empathy. Rapport is sensed almost entirely nonverbally. Experienced clinicians know that their work with patients is more efficient and more effective when both parties are in good rapport. In that harmonious state, historical information can be gathered more fully and accurately, therapeutic plans can be more easily negotiated, a clinician's advice is more apt to be followed, and both people are more satisfied with the exchange. Fortunately for clinicians and patients, good rapport can almost always be initiated easily if we pay conscious attention to our nonverbal messages. |Nonverbal behavior and feelings| | | Involuntary nonverbal communication more accurately reflects the feeling state of a person than does a verbal message. The nonverbal components of communication help give meaning to our spoken words and help us interpret how our words have been received. The full meaning of a communication can be found in the response a message evokes in the receiver (e.g., the patient). The patient's verbal and nonverbal responses may show you that s/he has interpreted your message exactly as you had hoped, or your patient's responses may surprise you by indicating that s/he has interpreted the message in a way other than what you intended to communicate. Getting a response different from the one you expected does not mean that your communication was bad. It just means it did not do the job you wanted it to do. You have not yet made your message clear. You may need to be flexible and find another approach perhaps verbally and nonverbally in order to communicate effectively. Involuntary nonverbal communication more accurately reflects the feeling state of a person than does a verbal message. In other words, it's hard to be dishonest nonverbally. If you perceive a mixed message from a patient, the nonverbal channel sends the truer message. Similarly, if a patient perceives a mixed message from his/her clinician, s/he is likely to put more credence in the clinician's nonverbal message. For example, if a clinician asks a question of a patient while maintaining eye contact, then turns to the paper or electronic medical record before the patient has begun to respond, it is quite possible that the patient will interpret the nonverbal message of breaking eye contact to mean that the clinician is not genuinely interested in the patient's response to the question. The clinician may feel confident that s/he can look at the chart and listen to the response at the same time but the patient may not share that perspective. It is certainly not necessary to be looking at the patient throughout his/her entire response, but it is helpful to support the beginning of the response with continued visual connection, and you should maintain that connection if the patient is expressing strong affect. |Monitoring the interview| | | Paying attention to the nonverbal communications that are flowing between clinician and patient allows either party to track the process of how the interaction is going for them. If things are not going well, the attentive clinician has a choice. S/he can bring the apparent difficulty into the \"open\" in terms of conscious, verbal discussion, or s/he can try to make more subtle shifts to improve nonverbal rapport. We will pay much more attention to the topic of building nonverbal rapport later in this module. All behavior is communicating something, and all behavior is adaptive. A patient's behavior does not occur in a vacuum, but rather is an adaptive response to his/her unique world view. We may not be able to recognize immediately the adaptive purpose of a particular behavior, especially if it is self-destructive. However, recognizing that every behavior has some kind of adaptive purpose may allow us to stay on the \"same side of the fence\" with the patient, rather than becoming judgmental and pulling away. This stance also allows the creation of a therapeutic alliance that can help the patient change the behavior. |FOUR CATEGORIES OF NONVERBAL COMMUNICATION| | | The four categories of nonverbal communication are kinesics (movement), proxemics (shaping space), paralanguage (pitch, tone, volume), and autonomic (physiologic changes from the autonomic nervous system). Kinesics refers to behaviors that involve movement, such as facial expressions, eye gaze, levels of body tension, gestures and fidgeting, how and where we touch each other, and body position (or posture). These are typically nonverbal behaviors over which we have some degree of voluntary control.( [5](9_0.htm#3)) Proxemics refers to how the space is shaped between interacting individuals, and includes vertical height differences, interpersonal distance, angles of facing, and physical barriers such as charts, computers, desks, and exam tables. Paralanguage includes all the qualities of the voice: tonality, rate, rhythm, volume, and emphasis.( [6](http://webcampus.med.drexel.edu/doccom/user/static/module_14/2_main/9_0.htm#4)) Not only can we use these qualities to deliver quite different messages with the same words: I am ordering these tests; vs. I am ordering these tests; vs. I am ordering these tests but we each have our own unique voiceprint, much like our fingerprint, that often lets others identify us immediately when we phone, even before we tell them who it is that is calling. A warm and inviting voice on the phone or in the office - can create relaxation and comfort in a patient, and help them more readily talk about their primary concern.( [7](http://webcampus.med.drexel.edu/doccom/user/static/module_14/2_main/9_0.htm#4)) Attending to paralanguage is also very helpful in telephone medicine where the only nonverbal cues are in the auditory domain. Autonomic changes are truly involuntary nonverbal signals that reflect alterations in a person's internal state. Facial color can shift from neutral to flushed or blanched. The conjunctivae can begin to glisten as an early sign of tearing. You can see sweating or feel it in a handshake. You can notice whether a person is breathing calmly, sighing, or taking in a deep, startled breath. Pupil size dilation and constriction can be observed if the iris is a light color. Changes in these autonomically controlled signals usually reflect strong feelings, worthy of your notice. These signals may provide you with clues and cues to the patient's significant health concerns and/or information about how the patient is feeling about you and what you just did or said. |FOUR GENERAL PATTERNS OF NONVERBAL RESPONSE IN CLINICAL SETTINGS| | | Since it is possible to observe hundreds of bits of nonverbal data, developing a cognitive framework to sort the data and identify patterns of behavior is a useful learning strategy. Four patterns are particularly important to detect. | | Patterns are often mixed rather than occurring in \"pure culture.\" Also, nonverbal communication differs across cultures, with the major exception that \"safe\" and \"not safe\" seem to be universal patterns. |Safety| | | In the context of a doctor-patient visit, the most important distinction that nonverbal signals can help you make is whether the patient appears to feel \"safe\" or \"not safe.\" \"Safe\" is relaxed or neutral, compared to \"unsafe\" which is activated (fight or flight) or withdrawn (conservation-withdrawal). Safety is a basic human need, and is about self-protection and self-preservation. When we humans feel safe, our catecholamine levels are relatively low. We can hear what is being said to us. Our brains are able to absorb a broad range of information, process the information, and produce new thoughts and questions. When both patient and doctor feel safe, they are in the best state to accomplish productive work. In other words, the patient needs to feel safe enough to reveal real concerns, fears, and vulnerabilities to their clinician; and then be psychologically available to hear, see and react to the doctor's responses. The clinician needs to feel safe enough and \"present\" enough (not fearful, distracted, or anxious) to hear the patient's story medically and psychosocially, and then to respond with all of his/her medical and human insight. If safety is not present for the patient, s/he will reveal \"not safe\" behaviors which are most commonly those of \"fight\" or \"flight.\" A less common response is \"conservation-withdrawal.\"( [8](http://webcampus.med.drexel.edu/doccom/user/static/module_14/2_main/9_0.htm#8)) Each of these has characteristic nonverbal features of kinesics, proxemics, paralanguage, and autonomic shifts. It is therefore possible for you to read quickly the patterns of each response. We'll look at each these patterns in static form on the next several pages, and then in action on the video clips. |Safe pattern| | | In safety, the predominant feature is that the body is engaged, relaxed, and in an open posture. People who feel safe show reduced body tension, reduced interpersonal distance, and relaxed facial muscles. Arms and legs are relaxed as well, and typically uncrossed. There is variation in gestures and in voice tones, as the sense of safety gives rise to freer expression. Facial color is neutral and other autonomic signals are generally \"quiet.\" | | This person appears relaxed in face and posture, as if about to speak, and her crossed legs may or may not be an important gesture at this time. |Fight pattern| | | In \"fight,\" the predominant stance is one of engagement, and of attack or retaliation as a defense to feeling unsafe. In full expression, it looks like a \"raging bull.\" Typical nonverbal signals of fight include heightened body tension, leaning forward with jutting jaw, clenched fists, narrowing of the inner eye brows, flaring of the nostrils, and tensing of the mouth. Voice volume typically increases and becomes more staccato, and breathing is deeper. The face may flush. | | This person's posture is forward, her jaw juts out tensely, and her nostrils may be flared. Her posture shows tension in arms, legs and right hand is clenched on her knee. Her face may be flushed. | | This person's jaw juts out and her entire face is tense, with flared nostrils and flushed face. |Flight pattern| | | \"Flight\" is characterized by increased body tension, as in \"fight\", but shows disengagement, rather than engagement. Characteristics of the flight pattern are easy to remember because everything flees nonverbally: the person may pull back or tuck the chin, turn the head and avert the eyes; barriers of crossed arms and legs may go up; the voice volume diminishes and speech may be strained or hesitant; color may blanch, and breathing may be faster, more shallow, or held. | | This person is leaning away from the desk, her arms are crossed, her chin is tucked in and her face more relaxed than tense. |Conservation-withdrawal pattern| | | In \"conservation-withdrawal,\" the person is overwhelmed with excessive input and unable to mount a response. The nonverbal cues are disengagement and relative immobility. The still body is slumped with sagging face and limbs; the voice is very soft and speech is hesitant when present; color is more neutral, neither flushed nor blanched; barriers are down. This pattern is well known to experienced clinicians as the look of a patient with marked depression, and the look of someone who is emotionally and physiologically overwhelmed in an intensive care unit. | | This person is slumped down with slack arms; her eyes are closed or looking very downward. |Some exceptions to the patterns| | | Patterns are often mixed rather than occurring in \"pure culture.\" \"Safe\" and \"not safe\" seem to be universal patterns across cultures, while other nonverbal communication differs in diverse cultures. Similarly, facial expressions of fear, anger, disgust, grief, surprise and joy seem to be consistent across diverse cultures. ( Having looked at all four behavior patterns, we need to qualify these general forms by noting that it is important to read the overall pattern of nonverbal responses rather than to rely on any one signal. Patients may cross their arms because the room is cold, or because there are no arms on the chair yet their bodies remains quite relaxed and engaged and their voices are melodious, indicating overall safety in the encounter. You may see a flushed face and hear a loud voice as a patient describes being angry with someone else in his/her life, while s/he is actually feeling safe enough with you to share the story. It is also important to note that you will frequently see mixed responses, such as fight and flight, especially in patients who are angry with us but are afraid to jeopardize the relationship by telling us. Such a patient might show us an angry face but his body might be pulling away and his arms might be crossed. Another caveat is that there is important cultural variation of some nonverbal behaviors, with different significance attached to gestures, eye gaze and eye contact, and to norms about interpersonal distance and touch. Eye contact, for example, is a behavior that is generally appreciated as a sign of engagement and attentiveness in cultures of Western European origin, while sustained eye contact is viewed as rude and disrespectful in Asian cultures of Chinese derivation.( [10](http://webcampus.med.drexel.edu/doccom/user/static/module_14/2_main/9_0.htm#10)) Being ready to have conversations with our patients that help us explore and learn from them - when we sense misunderstanding of some behavior - is key to good relationship-building across cultural differences. ( m 15) |BUILDING NONVERBAL RAPPORT| | | Rapport simply means \"I am with you,\" and is the nonverbal structure of empathy. Some researchers have called it \"interactional synchrony.\" We think building nonverbal rapport is the single most important nonverbal skill. We can create or deepen rapport by matching and leading patients' nonverbal behaviors. Building rapport helps create the form or vessel in which to hold the therapeutic clinician-patient relationship. It consists of two parts: matching and leading. | | |Matching| | | Matching is the process of mirroring aspects of another person's behaviors. The patient who is \"matched\" usually feels that his emotional state is acknowledged and understood by the physician. When matching, you join patients in that state. You can match anything you notice: facial expression, voice volume and rate, body posture and gestures. As you begin to create synchrony with the other person, you quite literally begin to enter their world nonverbally. Patients unconsciously recognize this nonverbal acknowledgement, although consciously they usually just report a sense of being \"understood.\" Matching is the nonverbal equivalent of the verbal empathy skills of \"naming an emotion,\" \"mirroring\" or \"reflection,\" and nonverbal matching is empathy in action rather than in words. The alliance-building generated by the nonverbal signals is at least as powerful as words that express empathy, and often builds even more trust and safety. Strive to be graceful and respectful in your matching, and to match only enough so that what you are doing does not come into the patient's conscious awareness. Otherwise, the patient will feel mocked rather than supported. We humans often slide into matching each other completely unconsciously. Turn off the sound sometime when you are watching a live television broadcast. You can easily see the spontaneous postural matching of characters who are in rapport and the postural mis-matching of individuals who are out of rapport. |Leading| | | Leading is the utilization of the interactional synchrony that has been set up by matching. Like dancers, two people in rapport are motivated to stay that way. Therefore, a leading motion by one person of a pair will quite likely invite a reciprocal response in the other person. For example, if the patient across from you appears to be feeling \"not safe\" - sitting upright with arms crossed - and you choose to mirror this subtly in your own posture by sitting more upright, the patient may feel met and more understood. When you have matched this posture for a few moments, you can begin to lean in a bit more toward the patient and notice whether the patient follows. With practice, if you discover that your patient appears \"not safe,\" you can match an aspect of her behavior and try to lead her to \"safe\" - the state in which mutual understanding can more easily be achieved. |As you are introduced to the concepts of leading and matching, you may worry that we are suggesting that you become duplicitous or manipulative and \"trick\" patients in some way.| We emphasize that we are asking you to become conscious of leading and matching activities and skills that are entirely natural but usually unconscious (as in dancing). Using these skills will improve your ability to serve your patients more fully and directly. We understand learning these skills to be the same as learning new verbal communication skills, in order to inform and guide patients more effectively. As discussed in modules 6 and 13, building and maintaining rapport is an essential aspect of your ability to effectively engage patients in collaborative partnerships that promote healing and health. |Videos to practice your observational skills| Example 1: |View this video clip to practice your observational skills| | | Quiz Question: Click the hyperlinks that apply - and receive feedback: Example 2: |Now view the continuation of this interaction to see what happens next| |Discussion: | Note that the physician's eye contact is now congruent with her verbal and other nonverbal messages, and the patient feels safe enough to overcome her initial nonverbal disengagement and proceed to speak about her additional concern. The course of the visit looks like it's going to be different from the prior example. The patient's disclosure may extend the length of the visit. However, the physician now has the option of prioritizing the agenda for the visit so as to include discussion of the additional concern without lengthening the visit. If the concern is not noted by the physician, it might become a \"doorknob\" concern that lengthens the ending of the visit, or leaves the patient very unsatisfied. (See doc.com module 07: \"open the discussion\") |SHAPING SPACE FOSTERS RAPPORT| | | You can use several components of proxemics to foster rapport and safety in the doctor-patient relationship. |Setting the stage| | | Every bit of the outside and inside of your offices and hospitals can give a message of invitation or dis-invitation. You can arrange space to encourage access and comfort which, in turn, helps both patient and doctor to relax, and feel safe. How a clinician arranges and uses the spaces of his/her waiting room, consultation rooms, and exam rooms has significant influences on the experiences people will have in those rooms. If you haven't already toured your office spaces pretending to be a patient, we highly recommend this exercise. Sit in all the chairs in which your patients may sit. Lie down on the exam tables. Try on an exam gown. Take a look at whether desks, tables, computers and book shelves create spaces in which you feel comfortable from the patient's perspective. Are any of those pieces of furniture forming barriers that separate patient and doctor in ways that do not support effective exchanges? Does the art on the walls reflect your taste? Is it likely to appeal to the majority of your patients? Do you provide reading material that is apt to be useful and/or appealing to the majority of your patients? And does the literacy level of the reading material span the literacy range of your patients? |Vertical Height Differences| | | You can minimize the negative effects of power differences by minimizing differences in vertical position. Vertical height differences can quickly create or reinforce feelings about power and control. Add to this the facts that patients often feel vulnerable when meeting a new clinician, and fearful if they suspect the possibility of a serious illness. Be willing to match a patient's eye level, or even to seat yourself so your eyes are lower than the patient's. This will nonverbally offer your support and the reassurance that you are there to be helpful, not controlling. Example 1: |Check out the video on the left. | How do you think the vertical posture of the physician influences the patient's communication? |Discussion: | In this video the patient does not say anything. The physician seems rushed, and her nonverbal behavior could be interpreted as \"I am in charge, and I have important business elsewhere.\" Example 2: |Check out the other video on the left. | How do you think the change in vertical height influences the patient's communication? |Discussion: | The patient seems to have found a voice, perhaps because the physician has sat down and remained fully attentive. How do you think the change in posture influences the physician's communication? We cannot know if the physician's initial intent in sitting down was to go more slowly, or if sitting allowed her to go more slowly, but she certainly leaves more space for the patient to ask questions. We must sometimes talk with patients who are lying in bed whether a hospital bed, an emergency room stretcher, or the patient's bed at home. How we place ourselves in relation to supine patients can greatly affect both our comfort and theirs. This in turn will affect the ease with which our verbal exchange can occur. Towering over someone creates nonverbal hierarchy that discourages patients from asking questions and voicing concerns. It is always preferable to sit down when speaking to a patient in a bed. Sitting down also conveys to the patient a sense that you have the time to listen. It is also preferable to sit on a chair, rather than on a patient's bed, since sitting on the bed may \"crowd\" some patients uncomfortably and convey disrespect to others. |Interpersonal Distances | (the horizontal space between us) | | Adjust your distance from the patient according to signals of safety. A third way to work with spatial relationships is through interpersonal distance. If you are too close during an interview, the patient will feel that his space has been encroached upon, and is likely to behave in ways intended to restore the proper distance such as looking or turning away, crossing arms and legs to put up a \"frontal barrier,\" or flushing. Being too far away discourages true engagement, and may convey a sense of disinterest to the patient. Example: |Check out the video on the left. | Note what signs of flight indicate that the physician is too close for this patient's comfort. |Discussion: | In this video clip the patient attempts to move back in his chair and crosses his arms. He does not speak during a pause in which he would likely offer more data, a question or a comment if he felt safe. |Angles of Facing| | | Adjust the angle at which you face your patient so as to emphasize collaboration; move more towards a side-by-side position rather than opposite each other. The fourth component of shaping space is angles of facing. Consider that opponents \"face off\" against each other. Colleagues or partners tackle challenges together \"shoulder-to-shoulder,\" or \"side-by-side.\" When you are examining information with a patient, e.g., laboratory results, you can create a greater sense of collaboration by sitting more side by side than opposite each other. The lab results can be positioned in front you both, rather than being \"the problem\" in between you. Sitting on a chair or stool on rollers can be very helpful in joining spatially with your patient when you feel that is appropriate. Imagine a different set of circumstances, for example, when you need to recommend a life-style change that is not what your patient wants to hear. You disagree. If you are seated directly opposite each other, you and your patient may experience the difference as more of a confrontation than is actually intended. Once you are aware of this sense of confrontation rather than collaboration, you can begin to diffuse it by slowly changing the angle at which you are facing each other. Just a slight angulation can begin to ease the tension. Moving to an even more side-by-side position can generate feelings of support and collaboration, in spite of the disagreement. |Physical Barriers| | | Show your interest in staying in connection by adjusting your position with regard to potential barriers. The fifth component of space we'll examine is that of physical barriers. These can be crossed arms and legs, a desk, a chart, a computer, an exam table or any other piece of furniture or equipment. How can we work with them? We can go around them, work around them, move them out of the way, comment on them if they are fixed, and do absolutely nothing about them if the barrier proves useful to the patient and the doctor. The key is our awareness of them, and our efforts to stay connected with our patient. Example 1: |Check out the video on the left. | How does the barrier of the computer on the physician's desk effect the communication in this movie? |Discussion: | The physician and the patient have trouble making eye contact. The physician seems to be preoccupied with the keyboard. The patient, without eye contact, seems distracted and not attentive to the physician. He offers short responses after her verbal questions, but does not expand his story or relate to the physician during her silences. Example 2: |Check out the other video on the left. | How does the physician's noting the barrier of the computer and aligning side by side with her patient effect the communication here? |Discussion: | Both physician and patient seem attentive to each other in spite of the computer. The conversation flows, with voice modulation and body movements that indicate relaxation and engagement. |AVOID MIXED MESSAGES| | | Create safety by assuring congruence of your verbal and nonverbal communications, and attend to any non-congruent communications from your patients to you. We'll now put several of your nonverbal skills together to help you work with your patients in ways that can literally \"save the day,\" save the relationship, and save important outcomes of visits by bringing your attention to the mixed messages that so often flow between patients and doctors. \"Congruent\" communications demonstrate a synchrony between the verbal and nonverbal behaviors. The words and the behaviors that go with the words send the same signals to the other person. \"Non-congruent\" or mixed messages occur when the words and the nonverbal behaviors do not agree. This happens, typically, when a person feels conflicted about expressing feelings directly. This conflict arises when people do not feel safe enough to say how it really is between them. Both patients and doctors send mixed messages. For each party, the nonverbal component of the message more truly reflects the speaker's feelings in the moment. When you wonder out loud why your patient looks \"worried\" and says she is \"fine,\" you are addressing the non-congruent verbal and nonverbal signals - the mixed message. This usually helps the patient feel safe enough to convert an incongruent \"fine\" to a congruent \"well, actually I was ...\" You express interest and concern when you notice patients' non-congruent messages. Your willingness to explore them enhances rapport, cooperation, collaboration and facilitates healing. A second common scenario is a patients' reluctance to take medicine or undergo some test or treatment. This might be addressed by \"validating\" or \"legitimizing\" the patient's non-congruent expressions by saying, \"Many patients about to take a new medication have concerns about it, such as cost, side effects, working it into their daily schedule . . ..\" Perhaps the most common non-congruent message from physician to patient is around reassurance. The physician says, \"you'll be fine,\" and has an expression of sadness or withdrawal. If the patient feels safe enough to inquire about the non-congruent message just sent by you, you have the opportunity to strengthen your relationship even further. Additionally, patients who experience your congruence are far more likely to cooperate, to adhere to plans and to give you as much information and help as they can. |REVIEW| Let's start by assessing the rapport between doctor and patient in the next short video clip. Example 1: |Click on the picture on the left and check out the first 15 seconds of a short video. | Are patient and clinician in rapport? What clues do you find convincing? |Discussion: | Their smiles match. Their voice tones match. Their postures demonstrate equally relaxed body tension and ease of motion. The desk is not a barrier. Their eye contact suggests engagement. Example 2 |Watch the complete movie now. This pair was in such good rapport just moments ago. What happened?| |Discussion: | This clinician is clear about her concern for this patient because of the family history of breast cancer. However, she has not effectively conveyed her concern in any way that will motivate the patient to obtain the mammogram. The clinician's break in eye contact with the patient as she attends to the paperwork causes the physician to miss the initial and dramatic turning away by the patient. Then, as the physician delivers the paperwork to the patient, she does not react to the facial and postural cues of disengagement that signal the patient's distress. The clinician fails to hear the patient's change in paralanguage the \"oh sure\" which is the patient's explicit \"yes\"/agreement, but her voice tone speaks a louder implicit \"no/disagreement.\" Example 3 |This scenario unfolds the same way, until the clinician responds to the patient's head hanging and sudden quiet with a verbal inquiry. | Which nonverbal signals encourage the patient to disclose the source of her conflict? | | Discussion: How are these signals congruent with the clinician's verbal responses? Her empathic verbal response directed towards the patient's distress confirms the above-mentioned nonverbal signals. What outcomes might differ between the two visits? We do not know the outcomes of the two visits, but we suggest that the patient is more likely to obtain the mammogram in the second instance, that the time spent in discussion is likely not more than an additional minute or two, and that both patient and clinician will likely be more satisfied with the second encounter. Higher satisfaction at resolving or simply addressing this patient's conflict in the moment may have important positive long-term consequences. |CONCLUSION| | | We've covered a number of nonverbal skills. All of them can enhance the doctor-patient relationship, and their neglect can do serious harm to the relationship. The key to working with these nonverbal communication skills is to practice, and to do so by breaking them down into small pieces. For example, you can decide to specifically monitor facial expressions in the first two or three patients you see in the office on a given day. Then you can switch to voice tones on another day. At still another time, you might choose to pay particular attention to qualities of the space in your medical \"encounters.\" While you are out and about say at a restaurant notice who is in rapport and who is not. Over time you'll become much more adept at reading all four categories of nonverbal communication in yourself and in others. We predict this will make for more congruent and rewarding exchanges with your patients. |ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS| The nonverbal communication model used in this module was developed by Cecile Carson, M.D. in 1987 through a grant from the National Fund for Medical Education.

See | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | Principles:| |Learning goals:| |INTRODUCTION| | | This module invites you to understand difference and diversity as resources for improving the effectiveness of your clinical care, and to learn and use skills that help you bridge differences and lower the anxiety that accompanies straying outside your cultural \"comfort zone\" The introduction section of this module is outlined as follows: |Case: Mr. Ware| | | How can you bridge some of the gap between the culture of medicine and Mr. Ware's concerns? You are seeing Cornelious Ware, a 67 year-old retired postal worker of African-American heritage. Two weeks ago, at your initial visit, he presented with three months of unintended fifteen-pound weight loss. He reported increased difficulty swallowing solids. He was experiencing no pain and could swallow liquids fairly well, but he finds that he has to chew his food for a long time, past the point of its being flavorful, in order to avoid an uncomfortable \"sticking\" in his throat. Because of his decreased enjoyment of eating, he avoided full meals, preferring instead to drink juices and smoothies. You suspected an obstructive lesion in his esophagus, and referred him to a GI specialist for upper endoscopy. Today, you note that he has lost five additional pounds, though his other vitals signs are unchanged. You do not find a note from GI in his chart. You ask him what the GI specialist advised. He says, \"I didn't go.\" |Difference| | | Differences between you and your patients test your ability to provide adequate medical care. Difference brings both challenge and opportunity into clinical encounters. When we encounter a difference, our habitual patterns of relating and responding to one another are tested. Our assumptions and norms for how to relate may not suffice when we are challenged to connect with someone different from ourselves. Such calls to an unfamiliar way of being are also opportunities to learn, unleash creative energy, and acquire new capacity for future challenges. The opportunities are usually anxiety-provoking, unsettling, and a threat to our identities and feelings of competence. |Communication Flexibility| | | In order to co-create successful relationships and carry out your duty to serve patients by providing the best care possible to each one, you will learn new skills, and use them flexibly. Physicians who listen actively, treat patients with respect, and provide clear explanations establish satisfying relationships. However, the feel-good advantages of fulfilling relationships are only one important result, and incontrovertible evidence shows that the quality of the communication affects health care outcomes ( [Stewart, 1995](9_0.htm#13)). Studied outcomes include such endpoints as blood pressure and diabetes control ( [Kaplan, 1989](9_0.htm#9)), successful health behavior change ( [Williams, et al, 1998](9_0.htm#14)) and the incidence of malpractice claims ( [Levinson, et al, 1994](9_0.htm#10)). Looking more closely at the dynamics of relationship building, we find that no behavior or set of behaviors taken in isolation by either person will lead to a desired outcome. Each relationship is a new co-creation; for success, both people will need to attend to the emergent, unique conditions of experienced past and anticipated future which create the lived present. In clinical encounters, the ethical duty of service requires that we do all we can to create an effective environment of care. Clinicians achieve this through an intense process of engaging in dialogue: iterative listening and responding to patients with whom we are co-creating relationships of care. |Culture| | | Characteristics ascribed to a cultural group (for example, gay men, physicians, Catholics, people from China, or people with diabetes) may correlate poorly or not at all with your experience of any individual member of that group. Culture can be defined as an integrated pattern of learned beliefs and behaviors that can be shared among groups - these include thoughts, styles of communicating, ways of interacting, views of roles and relationships, beliefs, values, practices, and customs. Culture is part of all of us and includes our individual influences, such as age, socioeconomic status, religion, gender, sexual orientation, occupation, disability, geographic origin, educational level, among others. Culture is a helpful construct for understanding the sum total of our experienced past and anticipated future as it relates to our affiliation with others. Since no two people share the exact same set of experiences, beliefs, and attitudes, every encounter can be thought of as a cross-cultural experience. Additionally, it is critical to remember that there is often no direct correlation between characteristics that we may ascribe to cultural groups and how an encounter with one group member will or will not adhere to our assumptions about the larger group |Culture of Medicine| | | Becoming an effective physician for groups of people who are significantly different from us requires that you forge an additional set of bridging skills, skills that we present and explore in this module. In addition to the numerous cultural forces that shape each of us, every physician has undergone medical training, an acculturation to the professional lifestyle, and exposure to the underlying scientific principles of clinical medicine that most patients have not experienced. Finding a bridge between the medical world culture and the lives, aspirations and needs of our patients is challenging. Many instances of conflict between patient and physician stem from differences in the way that patients experience their illness (the symptoms, beliefs about their origin and course, and their overall personal and social context), and the physician's understanding of those symptoms as a diagnosis of disease (the biomedical model). Because of the inherent power differential in the patient-physician relationship, it is incumbent upon the physician to gather information using a patient-oriented, illness-centered approach, and to translate the principles of evidence-based, standard-of-care medicine into terms that the patient can understand. |Three key skils| | | Three tools, curiosity, empathy and respect, form the cornerstone of effective cross-cultural communication. Use of these skills in conjunction with the toolbox of relationship-centered communication skills elaborated in previous modules enables you to overcome typical cross-cultural communication barriers. Knowing how every aspect of every world culture might influence an individual encounter is an impossible goal. As families are composed of increasingly diverse mixtures of different cultures, every individual represents a unique m\u00e9lange that resists easy categorization. Developing encyclopedic lists of cultural generalizations inclines us towards perpetuating stereotypes. Furthermore, many sources of difference seem invisible, but ample evidence suggests that minorities of sexual orientation and socioeconomic status are susceptible to significant health disparities ( [Peterkin and Risdon, 2003](9_0.htm#12); [Long, et al, 2004](9_0.htm#11)) As a starting point, however, you will find it useful to have some familiarity with overall facts about the approaches of some different cultural subgroups to health and illness. Demonstrating that you intend to understand patients helps them feel you care and helps build trust. However, it is essential to balance that specific knowledge with effective patient-centered communication. There is no one way to treat any racial, ethnic, or other subgroup, since there is such great cultural diversity within each subgroup. Rather, it is useful to have a toolbox of interventions that can be individualized and applied in a patient- and family-centered way. The triad of curiosity, empathy, and respect can be very useful in your encounters and can enhance your understanding of cross-cultural differences. Further, each of those three overall strategies encompasses specific techniques that you can learn and practice in order to enhance your cross-cultural communication skills. |Quiz Questions| | | Consider the answers, then click on the Feedback-link.. 1) All encounters can be thought of as a cross-cultural experience.

A) Assumption B) Curiosity C) Diagnosis D) Empathy E) Judgment F) Respect |TOOLS OF CURIOSITY| | | Tools of curiosity include: In this section you'll find the following: |Eliciting Core Values about Health| | | Ask patients about prior experience with physicians or medical care to learn their beliefs about the medical community. You remember that Mr. Ware said he had not seen a doctor for many years, and came to the office at the urging of his wife, who was alarmed at his decreased food intake. Today you ask him why he hadn't seen a doctor for such a long time. He says that he still feels very healthy, and that doctors probably wouldn't be able to tell him anything useful. | | Showing your caring and expertise to patients, and patients' ability to receive these gifts, are more complex when differences are substantial. People carry aspects of their cultural identity in different ways. Sometimes the first clues to a different cultural approach to health arise from unexpected reactions to or misunderstandings in one or more of the fundamental issues in Table 1: | | Table 1 (Modified from Carrillo JE, Green AR, Betancourt JR. Cross-cultural primary care: a patient-based approach. Ann Intern Med. 1999;130:829-34) These are cultural \"hot buttons\" heavily infused with meaning and significance for people, and communication barriers frequently spring up because clinicians' and patients' assumptions and expectations differ so dramatically. Issues such as authority, gender-based roles and so on are heavily influenced by one's predominant culture; however, each family or social unit can diverge significantly from a given cultural norm in any category. Patients' interactions with clinicians will be affected by their acculturated approach to communication style, gender differences, expectations for confidentiality, and age differences. Remain open and flexible and remember that patients are in unfamiliar territory, doing their best to accept your care across these fundamental differences. As you build your relationships, ask patients to relate a story about prior encounters with physicians or the health care system. For example, you might ask, \"What challenges have you had with doctors in the past?\" If the patient has had no contact with the Western health care system, consider asking about how the patient thinks about health or illness (see \"Eliciting the explanatory model of illness,\" below). Pay specific attention to themes of cultural hot buttons ( [Table 1](#1)) or conflict that arise during this exposition. |Corroborate Your Preconceptions about Cultural Approaches to Health| | | Corroborate your preconceptions about cultural approaches to health by inviting your patients to share their knowledge and understanding with you. This invitation effectively honors patients' expertise and autonomy and also refines the accuracy of information that is important for you to optimize care You: I understand that religion is very important to many of my African-American patients. Is that true for you? Mr. Ware: My wife is the devout one I basically go along for the ride. You: Sometimes people mistrust doctors because of racial issues, experimentation like at [Tuskegee]. [He looks at you directly for the first time all visit.] Mr. Ware: That never happened to me, doc, but you never know. Those white doctors you really can't trust them. They hurt my people. They're not going to hurt me. Having a familiarity with cultural approaches to health that are common in patient populations with whom you interact is helpful. For example, some communities believe that supernatural forces cause illness, so patients or families may pursue the services of specialized shamans or rites such as exorcism. Conversely, do not assume that your Native American patient believes that the very mention of illness will, in turn, cause that illness (a common belief among Native Americans). Different cultural groups may have different experiences in different locales. Therefore, rather than provide a necessarily incomplete and inaccurate taxonomy of all cultures here, we encourage you to refer to online or print resources to gain some generalized background information on specific ethnic and cultural groups that you encounter (for examples, see Bigby, Cross-cultural Medicine). If you have a preconception about a particular cultural approach to health, share your ideas and check to see if they are accurate for that particular encounter. \"I understand that for some Latinos, religion is a very important part of health and illness. Is that true for you? How (or how not)?\" |Developing an Understanding of the Whole Person| | | Overall, showing interest in patients' cultural background and trying to know them as whole persons will help your rapport-building process. Many aspects of social context significantly affect patients' approach to illness even though the contextual element may have no relationship to medical science. For example, after you tell your patient that he has a myocardial infarction, he may choose to leave your emergency department against medical advice because he lives alone, with few social contacts, and feels pressured to make sure that his cat has enough food for his predicted sojourn in the hospital. Your immigrant patient who completed third grade before beginning work as a manual laborer may not understand medical vocabulary and may harbor beliefs about illness that you view as bizarre. | | Table 2: Determine the Patient's Social Context A. Control over environment (e.g., finances, education): D. Literacy and language: The many components of context in Table 2 cannot be addressed fully in the course of a single clinical encounter of average length. Optimally, you will discover increasing depths of knowledge about these domains as your relationships with your patients develop (for example, over several visits in the outpatient setting, or over the course of a hospitalization). |Eliciting Explanatory Models of Illness| | | A patient's \"explanatory model of illness\" encompasses the meaning that the patient attaches to the illness, its causes, fears or concerns about its course, and hopes for treatment. Your work across cultures will not be effective until you are able to elicit your patients' explanatory model. You: What do you think is causing your swallowing problem? Mr. Ware: You said it might be a tightness or a cancer in my esophagus. You: Well, what do you think it is? Mr. Ware: My wife feeds me too much. I'm here just so I can get her off my back. Probably I'm getting too fat around my swallowing tube because she makes me eat so much. Many patients respond clearly to questions about their explanatory model, while others answer with a story that seems tangential to the discussion. Clinicians who are focused on the biomedical model find such responses frustrating, but close attention to the subtext of the patient's story usually provides insight into the explanatory model. As we have seen, all cultures hold many beliefs about the important life issues of health and illness. Individual patients may hold all, some, or none of the traditional beliefs typically associated with their identified culture, depending on their level of assimilation or integration. In addition to eliciting the explanatory model, you will also find it helpful to determine the level of rigidity to which patients adhere to that model. Some patients may be open to a more biomedical model that you offer, but others will hold a fervent belief system around illness and be closed to traditional biomedical thinking or treatments. Effective treatment of this latter group of patients (at least, in the biomedical world view) may take some creative collaboration and plan-building (see Negotiating treatment plan, below, and doc.com module 11). | | Table 3: Questions that will help you elicit patients' explanatory model of illness Questions that will help you elicit patients' health agenda: Questions that will help you elicit patients' illness behavior: (Kleinman A, Eisenberg L, Good B. Culture, illness, and care: clinical lessons from anthropologic and cross-cultural research. Ann Intern Med 1978;88:251-8.) |Quiz Questions| | | Consider the answers, then click on the Feedback-link.. 1) \"I understand that some Puerto Ricans believe that certain spirits influence health and illness. Do you hold those beliefs?\" This question is an example of: A) Corroborating your own preconceptions about cultural approaches to health B) Developing an understanding of the patient as a whole person in his/her social context C) Eliciting the patient's core values about health D) Eliciting the patient's explanatory model of illness 2) A 41 year-old man presents to you with back pain. Which of the following questions does NOT elicit a dimension of a patient's explanatory model of illness? A) Have you seen anyone else for your pain besides a physician? B) How can I be most helpful to you? C) What do you think is causing your pain? D) Where is the pain located? E) Why do you think your pain started when it did? |II. TOOLS OF EMPATHY| | | Your careful attention to the verbal and non-verbal signals of connection and relationship from your patients is probably the most useful method for learning appropriate expressions of empathy for a person from a different culture. You can check your impressions with the patient, and you can ask other people familiar with the culture who can act as cultural consultants or \"translators\" for you. You: It must be frustrating for you to have your wife tell you to eat more, and to feel forced to come here. I imagine you might feel you're doing a favor for her. Mr. Ware: I AM doing a favor for her. You: I want you to know that I am not in cahoots with her we're here first and foremost for you and your health. Mr. Ware: OK. You: And I'd really like to thank you, truly, deeply, for telling me as much as you have, and for being honest about it. I imagine it's been difficult for you. [Mr. Ware's expression seems to soften just a bit, though he remains silent.] The Modules on Therapeutic Aspects of Medical Encounters (M3), Building Relationship (M 6), and Understanding the Patient's Perspective (M9) emphasize the fundamental importance of using empathy to witness patient experiences of illness whether you are speaking with someone of your own culture or not. You will encounter several challenges in communicating empathy across cultures: Nonverbal expressions are generally more helpful, and tone of voice, smiling and eye contact are seldom fraught with cross-cultural confusion - see doc.com module 14 \"It goes without saying\". |III. TOOLS OF RESPECT| | | You can collaborate with patients from other cultures in developing a treatment plan by using the \"Ask-Tell-Ask\" outline presented in doc.com Module 11. You: Mr. Ware, sounds like you're still having problems swallowing, and I can see that you're still losing some weight. Mr. Ware: Everyone tells me I look better. You: Yes, but am I correct that you used to enjoy eating but don't any more? You said you thought it might be getting fat around your esophagus? Mr. Ware: Yeah, I think so. You: Like you said, I think there might be something there. I don't know about fat. Like I said last time, there might be a narrowing in your esophagus. It could be many things, and one of those things could be cancer. Mr. Ware: Well, doc, what do you say we do about it? You: I'd like for you to be able to enjoy eating again. I'd like for you to stop losing weight so rapidly. Would you like those two things? Mr. Ware: Yeah, probably. You: Ideally, I'd ask the GI doctor to take a look with a scope and a camera. But it seems like you might be worried that they'll experiment on you? Mr. Ware: You just can't trust them to do what's right for you. You: If I could, I would refer you to a black or Asian GI specialist. Maybe I could see if there is one who could do your scope test. Mr. Ware: Keep talking. You: There is one GI doctor who I really trust. He is white, but he is one of the most trustworthy people I know. Mr. Ware: Maybe I should talk to him first to figure out for myself. You: That sounds like a good next step. |Collaborative Development of a Therapeutic Plan| | | Negotiating plans across differences and diverse cultures requires you to attend to additional specific issues when using the Ask-Tell-Ask approach to Sharing Information (see doc.com module 10) and Reaching Agreement (see module 11) These include the following: |Advanced Situations| | | Other \"hot buttons,\" such as family and authority, thoughts about body functions and non-verbal cues come to the fore when you and the patient face important decisions. The role of family and authority in decision-making The role of family and authority are fundamental cultural hot buttons (Table 1). The patient's family and/or their attitudes to hearing physician advice may influence any medical decision-making, particularly in difficult situations. In addition, you will need to discover the cultural proscriptions around whether to tell a patient about diagnoses, who else to inform in a patient's family, and how and when to disclose. Finally, trust is of critical importance in people whose cultural background includes suspicions of Western medicine. Lack of trust may stem from patients' or families' strong faith in their own healing traditions, and/or personal, historical, or perceived experience with inappropriate or withheld medical care. Importance of language and ideas about bodily organs Different cultures express illness through body parts. For example, in Chinese, there is no verbal expression for \"depression\"; the closest description translates to \"heavy heart,\" which in literally-translated, culturally insensitive encounters can lead to expensive and unnecessary work-ups for coronary artery disease. Nonverbal communication |Patients who do not have a broad command of the language that you use will be more attuned to nonverbal cues than specific words.| Physical presence, tone of voice, and gestures send powerful messages. Physical contact is another cultural hot button ( [see Table 1 below](#1)); a patient may construe touch as an unacceptable breach of personal space, no matter how routine or innocently intended you perceive it to be. The United States and Canada are relatively \"low-context\" cultures in which most information is clearly delineated. In contrast, \"high-context\" cultures, such as Japan and Colombia, generally place higher value in social behaviors, ambiguity, and politeness, so that listeners infer messages without direct delineation, and nonverbal signs are of paramount importance. In addition, some gestures that are acceptable in your culture may be insults in others. For example, the gesture used in the United States to show agreement or \"OK\" (thumb and forefinger formed in a circle, with the remaining fingers fanned outward) represents an unprintable insult in some southern European cultures. It is impossible to catalog all of the world's gestures here. We must resign ourselves to the fact that we will occasionally make a cultural faux pas; to learn from these mistakes in a dignified and respectful manner without too much self-flagellation serves our patients (and us) most fruitfully. Summary of Collaborative Planning In summary, developing a culturally sensitive collaborative plan includes the following elements: | | Table 1 (Modified from Carrillo JE, Green AR, Betancourt JR. Cross-cultural primary care: a patient-based approach. Ann Intern Med. 1999;130:829-34) |IV. FOCUS ON PERSONAL AWARENESS IN CROSS-CULTURAL ENCOUNTERS| In this section you'll find the following: |Discerning Your Hot Buttons with Mr. Ware| | | Enhancing your skill with cross-cultural communications depends on your continuing efforts to identify your cultural origins and explore and discern the ways that your cultural hot buttons affect your interactions with people different from yourself. As you reflect on Mr. Ware's difficulty in interacting with the health care system, you are struck by an internal conflict. You would like to respect Mr. Ware's wishes, knowing that a paternalistic approach would be ineffective, while you also know that the standard of care in his situation is to pursue upper endoscopy. You see that your own inner conflict is a cross-cultural one between older and younger, between his conception of his illness and your acculturation into medicine, and possibly other cultural factors, such as differences in dealing with authority or power. You see that your inner struggle directly correlates to the developing conflict in your relationship. You realize that to resolve this conflict and provide the best care for Mr. Ware; your paramount consideration is to foster a sense of honesty and trust by modeling honesty and trustworthiness. You: Mr. Ware, I am being as honest as I can humanly be. I know I can't force you to do anything you don't want, and I respect that. At the same time, as your doctor, I'm feeling anxious to find out what is causing your symptoms, so we can get on with what to do next. Mr. Ware: You seem like you mean it. You [laughing]: I absolutely do! Mr. Ware: All right. I promise I'll go and talk to the GI guy. But if I can't trust him, I need you to find me someone I can trust. You: I promise to help work on that with you. |Learn through reviewing your non verbal signals| | | Videotaping and reviewing a cross-cultural interview increases your awareness of the effects of your nonverbal communications An additional effective method for development of your personal awareness is to videotape a cross-cultural encounter, with the patient's consent. Review of this videotape with a preceptor and/or with colleagues affords you additional insights. Not only do you increase your understanding of the non-verbal cues you might send, particularly to a patient who does not have complete command over the language you use, but you also augment your knowledge of your verbal communication patterns. |Continue Exploring and Developing Your Awareness of Cultural Differences| | | Personal awareness does not have a discrete end-point, but is an ongoing process, particularly relevant to your effectiveness in communicating and building relationships across differences. The more deeply you understand your own cultural influences, biases, and approaches, the more available you will be to noting differences in others. We hope you will develop into an effective clinician who values being interested and appreciative of your patients' cultural identities and approaching other cultures with fewer preconceptions. Please review our \"Reflection Questions\" listed at the outset of this module as a way to explore and appreciate influential aspects of your own professional and cultural identity. Then revisit these questions, particularly after challenging experiences, and continue to clarify how your own cultural heritage influences your role as a clinician. Find ways to share your reflections with other health care providers, in order to enhance your understanding as you interact with others whose differences from you are always multiple and frequently contribute to confusion. We predict that if you apply the techniques of curiosity, empathy, and respect in safe collegial environments, the experience you gain there will assist you during challenging patient interactions. Modules 2 and 4 are specifically designed to enhance your ability to explore personal issues relevant to your professional development. |V. PREJUDICIAL OR DISCRIMINATORY REMARKS| | | When patients, families, or (yes) colleagues confront you knowingly or unknowingly with a cultural epithet or discriminatory remark about difference, you can develop response options along the continuum of curiosity, empathy, and respect. When asking Mr. Ware background questions about his health-related behaviors, you ask, \"Are you sexually active with men, women, or both?\" He gives you an incredulous look and says, \"Of course, women. Who do those people think they are, anyway?\" All clinicians find that the challenge of responding with respect for both oneself and a valued \"other\" person in the face of a discriminatory remark is one of the hardest we ever encounter. Bridging the gap in a manner that values preserving the dignity of all parties is one of the most powerful ways to build trust and relationship. We therefore offer potential response examples. We list them as guides not as specific prescriptions. Because every situation is unique, and there are no simple \"correct\" answers for all situations, we offer potential advantages and risks with each method. |Responding to prejudice| | | Check out the video on the left Which of the following strategies might you use to respond? | | Curiosity \"I'd like to hear more about your attitudes towards 'those people.'\" Possible advantages: can be easily used as a reflexive response; can make a patient feel heard; can elicit a story or explanatory model that might make you understand why the patient holds that opinion; can be useful in situat*ions where a patient launches a subtle epithet (a mere knowing glance, or something like \"well, you and I know about people like that\"). Possible risks: you may encourage further remarks that could make you more uncomfortable. | | Empathic response \"Sounds like you have real misgivings about gay and lesbian people\" Possible advantages: can be easily used as a reflexive response; can make a patient feel heard; can elicit a story or explanatory model that might make you understand why the patient holds that opinion. Possible risks: you may encourage further remarks that could make you more uncomfortable. | | Empathic, curious confrontation \"Your position puts me in a bit of a bind, since I work with many gay colleagues. What do you feel that does to our work together?\" Possible advantages: establishes a sense of relationship and non-abandonment; offers self-disclosure and an opportunity for truth-telling for you; offers the patient an opportunity for explanation. Possible risks: self-disclosure can feel threatening depending on your own cultural background; may come across to the patient as a power play | | Respectful explanation \"Since many of my colleagues are gay, and since we are doing the best we can for your health, I would find it most helpful if you would keep those opinions to yourself, and I will do the same.\" Possible advantages: offers self-disclosure and an opportunity for truth-telling for you; establishes a firm mutual ground rule in agreeing to disagree Possible risks: can come across as condescending or as a power play; may miss hearing a story that might make you understand why the patient holds that opinion | | Silence / Empathic Redirection \"Some might find what you said pretty inflammatory. Let's move on.\" Possible advantages: very useful if you are about to lose your temper or may say something you may regret later Possible risks: you may miss hearing a story that might make you understand why the patient holds that opinion; a patient may interpret silence as agreement with the attitude or comment |Continue Practicing Skills| | | We emphasize that no approach is risk-free. Your reaction in any given situation depends on numerous variables, including your prior relationship with the person and your state of mind at the moment; therefore, having many tools will allow the most flexibility with your responses.

Goldstein, MD, F. Daniel Duffy, MD, Rob Shochet, MD | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | Michael B. Goldstein, MD Patient's |Learning goals:| | Patients would benefit greatly from improved clinician interviewing about adherence to medical regimens and health behavior change. Extensive research has produced evidence-based models that enhance understanding of the change process and specify effective interview skills and dynamics that enhance patients' likelihood of successful change. We present the \"5 A's\" model in this module, and evidence shows that routine clinical encounters will better promote change if clinicians employ this framework. The 5 A's are Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, and Arrange, and we describe specific skills to implement each \"A.\" Patient education and counseling is a core function of all medical encounters and an essential component of quality medical care. ( [1-3](9_0.htm#1)) Moreover, clinician use of effective communication and counseling skills promotes patient adherence to treatment and facilitates changes in patients' risky health behaviors, including smoking, problematic substance use or unsafe sexual practices. ( [1](9_0.htm#1), [4-9](9_0.htm#4)) Clinician health behavior counseling rates fall well below the targets recommended in Healthy People 2010, the US Health and Human Services' blueprint for preventive and behavioral health objectives for the nation. ( [9,10](9_0.htm#9)) Barriers to the adoption and implementation of effective interventions include time pressure, lack of training, limited patient and provider resources, and inadequate organizational elements to support and sustain clinician efforts. ( [6](9_0.htm#6), [9](9_0.htm#9)) Many clinicians are skeptical about spending valuable time on patient education and counseling while others feel frustrated, inadequately prepared or lack confidence in counseling skills. (See Table 1 below for a list of patient and clinician barriers to behavior change counseling) | | By Patients | | By Clinicians |Not knowledgeable about risks||Not enough time in visit| |Unaware of more acceptable options for change||Not trained in counseling| |Lacks social support for change||Frustration with those not ready to change| |Feels too stressed to change||Uncomfortable giving up control over goals and options for change| |Lacks confidence from prior failures||Difficulty feeling comfortable with less than perfect plan| |Lacks support and understanding||Difficulty listening to patient perspectives| |Feels ashamed or guilty about behavior and therefore responds defensively||Difficulty expressing empathy for patient's distress| Table 1: Barriers to Health Behavior Counseling Despite these barriers, good evidence from multiple studies indicates that clinicians who participate in specific training interventions do a better job of patient-centered health behavior counseling ( [11](9_0.htm#11)- [16](9_0.htm#16)). Moreover, interventions that combine clinician training with supportive prompts, or other reinforcement through organizational interventions produce significant changes in patients' health risk behaviors. ( [17-](9_0.htm#17) [24](9_0.htm#22)) |THE 5 A's - A UNIFYING APPROACH TO BRIEF HEALTH BEHAVIOR COUNSELING| | | The 5 A's construct derives from research studies with therapists, psychologists, and other clinicians over several decades. It is specifically designed as a practical way for physicians and other clinicians in ordinary medical care visits/encounters to better promote behavior change. Many skill elements relate closely to skills described and demonstrated in the \"Essential Elements\" modules of doc.com. The Counseling and Behavioral Interventions Work Group of the US Preventive Services Task Force recommended that physicians adopt the \"5A's\" framework. This construct reminds clinicians of the evidence-based conceptual elements and associated skills shown to be successful for delivering health behavioral counseling interventions in primary and general health care settings. ( [9](9_0.htm#9)) | | Table 2: The 5 A's (Modified from ( [9])) Over several decades researchers in psychology and behavioral sciences studied the frustrating, puzzling and sometimes incomprehensible behaviors that are surely detrimental to health such as smoking, drug use, overeating, failing to take prescribed medicines, and so on, seeking methods of helping people change. Eventually, several evidence-based health behavior counseling models emerged, including the Transtheoretical Model of Change [ [27](9_0.htm#27)] , [31](9_0.htm#31)), and Motivational Interviewing.( [32-34](9_0.htm#32)) The 5 A's framework (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange follow-up) derives directly from the \"4A's\" of smoking cessation that the National Cancer Institute developed in the 1980s. ( [25](9_0.htm#26), [26](9_0.htm#26)) The 5A's construct incorporates elements of several models cited above, and is consistent with their principles; however, it is specifically designed for use in medical care settings where the clinician and patient frequently must address a diverse agenda of health related items in a limited visit time. In the following sections, we describe the core elements of the 5As and provide examples of the skills that derive from each concept. When you focus interview time on behavior change, your interviews look different in important respects from other interviews, but will also contain many familiar elements. New skills relate to assessing \"readiness to change\", and \"conviction and confidence about change.\" Aspects of other important skills have already been presented in \"Essential Elements\" modules of doc.com. In this module we show how these basic skills form the foundation for modifications and elaborations in \"gathering information\" (doc.com module 8) change and \"sharing information\" (doc.com module 10) that converge as the 5 A's model for helping patients change unhealthy behaviors. |Begin Assessment| | | Start with open-ended inquiry about health behaviors such as smoking, drinking and safe sex, and employ building relationship (doc.com module 6) skills as you seek more detailed data about the behaviors that you focus on. The first A, Assess, focuses on \"gathering information\" that focuses on patients' health behaviors, beliefs about the behaviors, ideas about change and experience with it, and facilitators and barriers to change. Assessment usually begins with open-ended questions about health behaviors. Key targets of assessment include: 1) adherence to treatment recommendations, including medication adherence; 2) tobacco use, risky drinking, sedentary behavior, unhealthy diet, unsafe sexual practices, and 3) behaviors associated with chronic illness self-management such as self-monitoring, managing symptoms, and following through with medical visits. However, as discussed in prior modules, you must not only assess the behavior, but also patients' ideas, beliefs and feelings regarding the behavior and potential change, in order to tailor counseling to the particular patient's needs. The following dialogue demonstrates assessment of a patient's adherence to plans for treating congestive heart failure. Doctor: \"Many people have difficulty following through with taking medications and doing all the other things that are necessary to manage your heart condition. What difficulties have you been having?\" Patient: \"Well, to be honest, I have had a hard time remembering to take my medications when I am supposed to take them.\" Doctor: \"It sounds like it has been pretty confusing for you.\" Patient: \"Yes, it has .Sometimes I just get tired of taking pills. It seems you add new ones all the time, and then you change them. Isn't there a better way?\" Doctor: \"I can see that you are pretty frustrated. I appreciate how hard you have been working to manage your condition and take all of your medications. Let's see what we can do to simplify your regimen.\" In addition to assessing adherence using an open-ended question, the physician in the example above started out with a legitimizing (also called normalizing or validating) statement (i.e., \"Many people have difficulty .\") and also employed reflective listening and empathy. Use of these core skills builds rapport and increases the likelihood of patient adherence and other positive health behavior change outcomes. ( [8](9_0.htm#8), [35](9_0.htm#35)) |Assess stage of change and conviction and confidence about changing| | | Enlist patients in providing information that will help you assess patients' stage of change: precontemplation, contemplation, determination, action, maintenance and relapse. Explore the importance patients attach to changing a behavior (conviction), and their perceived ability to successfully change (confidence). Assessment of motivational readiness, or stage of change, is another key component of assessment. ( [27](9_0.htm#27), [36](9_0.htm#36)) Research demonstrates that individuals usually progress through a series of \"stages of change\" when making changes in behavior. ( [27](9_0.htm#27)) Clinicians will adjust their information giving and reaching agreement strategies to match patients' apparent stage of change. The stages are: precontemplation (unaware of a problem or no plan to change in the foreseeable future); contemplation (ambivalent about changing with no commitment to change in the near future); determination (intends to take action within the next month and has made some recent changes in behavior), action (actively attempting to change), maintenance (has successfully made change but still needs to monitor behavior to prevent slips and relapse), and relapse (has experienced successful change for extended periods, but now has gone back to prior behavior). Because many patients with risky behaviors are in the precontemplation or contemplation stages, not even thinking about taking action,( [37](9_0.htm#37)) the common clinician behavior of providing action-based strategies to all patients (e.g., prescribing medication for smoking cessation; referring an obese patient for nutrition counseling) proves ineffective and frustrating for both you and the patient.( [38](9_0.htm#38)) Assessment of stage of change permits you to tailor interventions and direct the dialog in more fruitful ways. (See the Agree and Assist sections below for more details regarding tailoring). In the videos below, Dr. Dan Duffy demonstrates assessment of the various stages of change. Video examples: When you click \"stages of change\" buttons above, videos with Dr. Duffy show how they apply: In addition to assessing stage of change, gathering information about patients' conviction and confidence helps you ascertain patients' current level of motivational readiness, and then tailor the remainder of the dialog.( [33](9_0.htm#33), [34](9_0.htm#34)) Conviction assesses what patients believe about the importance of taking action, while confidence assesses what patients believe about their ability to adopt or change a behavior despite obstacles or barriers (their \"self-efficacy\"). ( [33](9_0.htm#33), [34](9_0.htm#34)) You can use a numerical rating scale to assist in clarifying the extent of patients' conviction. Figure 1: Visual \"ruler\" Use of the conviction and confidence ruler allows identification of stage of readiness to change. When conviction if very low (e.g. 0-2), the patient is likely precontemplating. With higher conviction but low to intermediate confidence, the patient is contemplating. Ready for action is characterized by high conviction and intermediate to high confidence. The following example demonstrates how a physician uses the conviction ruler to assess the interest of a young woman in adopting the healthy behavior of using a birth control pill or having her partner use condoms. The patient wants a \"morning after pill\". Doctor: \"Have you considered asking your partner to use condoms when you have sex?\" Patient: \"No, not really. He doesn't like them.\" Doctor: hard to ask him to use them.\" Patient: \"Yeah, I don't want to push him to do something he doesn't want to do.\" Doctor: \"I see. Would it be ok if I asked you a few questions about your views toward condom use?\" Patient: \"Yeah, I guess.\" Doctor: \"Ok, on a scale of 0 to 10, how convinced are you that it is important to use condoms during sex?\" Patient: \"Oh, I would say a 4\" Doctor: \"A 4 .what led you to say as high as 4 and not lower?\" Patient: \"Well, I know they can keep me from getting pregnant .and I know they can help me to avoid an infection\" Doctor: \"That's right! I am glad you understand some of the benefits. Anything else that makes it a 4 and not lower?\" Patient: \"Well, I certainly don't want to get \"No one wants to get AIDS.\" Patient: \"My partner has been tested and he is fine ..but I guess you never know.\" Doctor: \"Right again. What would it take to raise your level of conviction about using condoms or some other method of birth control?\" Patient: \"Well, maybe if I thought I could get him to use them.\" Doctor: \"Hmmm so you need some help in convincing him of the value of using them.\" Patient: \"That's for sure!\" Doctor: \"I have some thoughts about talking with him, and I also can provide you with some information on that topic from Planned Parenthood.\" Patient: \"That would be good. Thanks!\" |Assess willingness to discuss| | | Ask permission to proceed with further explorations, and if patients grant permission, explore their knowledge, past experience and beliefs about the pros and cons for change. Continue to use Build Relationship skills and specifically express your appreciation of patients' past successes, even if they were small successes. In the dialog above, the clinician first asked permission to assess the patient's beliefs and feelings. Demonstrating clearly your respect for patient preferences and supporting patients' autonomy are important principles of effective health behavior counseling, and are good reasons why we recommend this \"ask\" (see doc.com module 10) strategy.( [39](9_0.htm#39)) Though hesitant, the patient gave her permission. After using the conviction scale to elicit interest, the clinician further explored the meaning of the patient's conviction rating. Asking \"'why 4 and not lower\" stimulated reflection and subsequent expressions of commitment, or \"change talk\". Research studies on \"motivational interviewing\" demonstrate that allowing patients to \"hear themselves think\" out loud about their level of commitment and interest in behavior change promotes subsequent health behavior change.( [39](9_0.htm#40)) (See section on Motivational Interviewing below.) Returning to the patient dialog above, we note that the physician used a follow-up \"ask\" question (e.g., \"what would it take to raise your level of conviction?\") to clarify an important barrier to change, as well as discover a potential solution. Learn the skill of assessing conviction and confidence, because you can often, as in the example above, promote movement toward change simply by helping the patient better understand herself. |Case: Relapse after 6 months of smoking cessation| | | Assessing the patient's knowledge, past experience and beliefs about the pros and cons for change can help you to understand and address a patient's counseling needs. To illustrate, let's consider a patient who has recently relapsed after a successful smoking cessation attempt. Patient: \"I feel a bit ashamed to tell you this ..I went back to smoking last month.\" Doctor: \"You seem upset about it.\" Patient: \"Yes ..I had worked so hard to get off those darn cigarettes.\" Doctor: \"You worked very hard. So, what happened?\" Patient: \"Well, you remember that I had weaned myself off the patch about 2 months ago and I was doing fine. Then my boss made increased demands on my time. I had several new projects to complete and felt anxious about getting them done. One night, I was going through some drawers looking for some papers .and would you believe it, I came across an old pack of cigarettes. I thought I would just smoke one to get me through the night. Then, I smoked another, then another. I felt terrible\" Doctor: \"Terrible.\" Patient: \"Yes, returned to smoking .I failed.\" Doctor: \"You were free of cigarettes for almost 6 months. You successfully avoided smoking more than 3500 cigarettes before having that first cigarette. That sounds successful to me. In fact, as we discussed before, many folks need to quit repeatedly before they learn what it takes in their own situation to stay a non-smoker.\" Patient: \"I guess you are right. So, what do I do now?\" Doctor: \"Well, let me ask you a few then we'll think together.\" Patient: \"Sure.\" Doctor: \"How convinced are it is important to quit again?\" Patient: \"Oh, it is still a 10.\" Doctor: \"Ok, you are still convinced about the importance of quitting. That's great. How confident are you that you can quit again, on that scale of 0 10?\" Patient: \"Oh, I'd say a 5 or 6 right now.\" Doctor: \"So, what makes it a 5 and not lower?\" Patient: \"Well, the patch really helped me it cut craving way down.\" Doctor: \"What else helped?\" Patient: \"Well, I used those strategies to get ready, they helped too. And the online support group you suggested .that was wonderful.\" Doctor: \"Sounds like you have a number of ideas about what can help you to quit again.\" | | Discussion: |Advise| | | After you obtain sufficient assessment through asking, begin to \"tell\" information and advice, using the guidelines from doc.com modules 10 and 11 regarding offering information in small bits, and continually checking with patients about their understanding and agreement. Offering advice (suggesting a specific behavioral change,) is the 5As element most familiar to clinicians. Solid experimental and controlled studies show that brief advice alone can be an effective intervention for promoting change in certain health behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation, reduction in risky drinking). If you deliver brief advice in the setting of limited time and little assessment, in an isolated manner, you should do so directly, clearly and non-judgmentally, and be prepared to briefly elaborate or arrange for follow up if the patient indicates interest in continued discussion. ( [41](9_0.htm#41)) Paradoxically, in spite of their familiarity with \"giving advice\" data show that clinicians seldom present any information or advice about risky behaviors, unless that is the specific agenda for an encounter. When more than a few moments are available for interaction, we recommend personalizing advice and putting it into the patients' specific context so as to maximize its effectiveness, as shown in the following example: Doctor: \"Stopping smoking will reduce the number and seriousness of your lung infections. Quitting should also allow us to reduce the amount of medication you have to take to control your asthma. What do you make of this?\" Patient: \"I won't have to take as much medication?\" Doctor: \"That's correct .that should help to address some of your concerns about finances. Quitting smoking will allow you to save a bunch of money at a pack a day, you are spending quite a bit on cigarettes.\" Patient: \"I could sure use that extra money.\" As noted previously, begin by showing respect for patients' autonomy by \"asking\" permission before giving advice, especially when conviction is low. Respect patients' choices and demur if they decline your request, but once permission is granted, share information using an \"Ask, Tell, Ask\" sequence. For example, before launching into sharing information and advice about monitoring blood sugars, you might ask, \"What do you understand about the benefits of checking your blood sugars?\" Information is best delivered in small bits, followed by an assessment of what the patient heard and learned. (see doc.com modules 10 and 11) |Agree| | | Help patients set simple and realistic goals for change, and demonstrate your willingness and ability to engage in a collaborative process. Assist your patients in generating options and assert your own, and foster autonomy by supporting your patients' choices. Agreeing on an achievable goal (such as, take the diabetes pill twice daily) is more important than persuading patients to agree to an \"optimal\" goal (from a health perspective; such as, check your sugar level 4 times a day) which they are less likely to accomplish. Having a clear goal for change makes subsequent evaluation of progress toward change feasible, and encourages small successes instead of big failures; thus, time you spend on seeking agreement on simple and realistic treatment goals (here, behavior change goals) is time well used. Agreement on goals is too often absent from clinician-patient encounters.( [42](9_0.htm#42)) However, goal setting is a crucial determinant of successful outcomes where behavior change is concerned. ( [41](9_0.htm#41), [43](9_0.htm#43), [44](9_0.htm#44)) You should foster a collaborative process for agreeing on goals, one that includes eliciting and clarifying patients' goals, articulating your clinical goals and finding common ground or negotiating a compromise.( [42](9_0.htm#42), [45](9_0.htm#45), [46](9_0.htm#46)) This process will assure that patients can choose a goal from among 2 or 3 options, and collaborating in the exploration of options predicts success at following up on the option finally chosen. The goal that you and patients agree on will frequently be somewhat short of your ideas on the best goals from a health perspective. It is difficult for a clinician to \"settle\" for less than optimal behavior change goals, medication taking or risk reduction. Of course, patients are in full control of their actions after encounters, and remembering this fact facilitates your relinquishing control over the final agenda and your sharing the goal setting process. You demonstrate this collaborative stance by using partnership skills (doc.com module 6) and continuing to explore your patients' perspectives (doc.com module 9) and express your acceptance of them in a nonjudgmental way. Giving up this control (the control is illusory, of course) helps patients lower their resistance, and is more likely to engage them in overcoming some of the personal and social barriers to undertaking and succeeding at the hard work of behavior change. For example, the goal choices for a patient with hazardous drinking who is in contemplation about changing drinking habits, and has low conviction and confidence and hangs out with a drinking crowd might include your idea to monitor drinking, or review written materials you supply or his idea to go to an AA meeting with a friend, just to see what it is like. For patients in precontemplation about condom use the choices might include your idea to access further information about condom use, or their idea to raise the issue with a partner, or to simply discuss again and explore potential consequences at another visit. As noted in Assess, above, supporting patient autonomy through fostering mutuality and choice promotes engagement in and movement through the process of change. ( [30](9_0.htm#30), [31](9_0.htm#31), [39](9_0.htm#39)) |Case: Ms. D's participation in management of her diabetes| | | Dr. W collaborates with Ms. D, and they agree to choose a realistic and measurable goal to begin losing weight to better manage her diabetes. This case scenario demonstrates goal setting with a patient with Type II diabetes, and picks up after Dr. W has assessed Ms. D's adherence to oral hypoglycemic medication and participation in diabetes self-management activities. Ms. D self-monitors blood glucoses daily and monitors her diet carefully, but has not been able to lose weight or increase her physical activity. She is frustrated that her hemoglobin A1C is still high, despite her efforts to manage her blood sugars. Doctor W: \"So, to summarize, it sounds like you have been checking your blood sugars very diligently, taking your medication every day and trying hard to follow the dietician's recommendations. You are having a tough time fitting activity into your routine and you have been struggling to lose weight. Though your hemoglobin A1C is down from the last visit, it is still close to 8 and both you and I would like to see it get down to 7 or below.\" Ms. D: \"That's right. I am so frustrated about my weight. I think I need some more help to be successful. I want to avoid having to take more medication to get that number down.\" Doctor W: \"Ok. I am hearing that your preference right now is to work on your weight. I can help you with that and we can hold off for now on recommending an increase in increase your medication.\" Ms. D: \"Thanks. Do you have any recommendations about what else I could do?\" Doctor W: \"Sure, though I would like to hear your ideas, too.\" Ms. D: \"Well, I read recently that exercise is very important, but that you have to exercise for an hour a day to actually lose weight and keep it off. An hour a day just seems impossible for me.\" Doctor W: \"It's great that you're seeking out the latest information. Though an hour a day is linked to sustained weight loss, the hour of activity can be broken up into multiple bouts of activity over the course of a day. Also, shooting for an hour a day when you are just getting started is too difficult for most people.\" Ms. D: \"You mean I can start out slow and work up to an hour a day?\" Doctor W: \"Absolutely. It is usually best to set a more modest goal to start. What do you think is a realistic starting goal for you?\" Discussion: In the above dialog, Doctor W asked Ms. D. about her preferences for a goal. They negotiated, and Doctor W said she was willing to hold further increases in Ms. D's medications while agreeing on Ms. D's choice to work on a weight management through increased physical activity. Once physical activity was chosen, Dr. W continued to help Ms. D. to choose a realistic and measurable short-term goal. |Assist| | | Help patients to develop action strategies, and to identify and overcome barriers to successful implementation of the action steps of a plan. When the actions required are extensive, complex or completely unfamiliar to patients, bring in an expanded clinical team. Set new goals if confidence is too low. Once patients choose a goal, your role shifts to assisting them to develop a specific realistic plan to achieve their goal. If your patient has high conviction and low confidence, you should focus on providing assistance to identify resources, strategies and skills that can enhance patient confidence or self-efficacy. You will have discussed elements of action plans as a part of the goal-setting process. Identifying and overcoming barriers to success is another important aspect of this process. Just as with setting goals, active problem-solving to make a coherent and feasible plan works best when patients identify a resource or strategy themselves.( [32](9_0.htm#32)) Exploring past experience with change may help the patient to identify strategies that were previously successful, at least partially or temporarily. On the other hand, identifying what went wrong after a period of success may clarify what else could be put in place to achieve a more durable result. Exploring resources within the patient's family and social network may uncover valuable supports. Ultimately, you may need to enlist an extended clinical team to teach the patient to use specific coping and self-management skills.( [29](9_0.htm#29), [47](9_0.htm#47)) Multidisciplinary teams can share the burden of education, counseling and skills training among several clinicians, particularly when behaviors are heavily reinforced in patients' lives (no physical activity, or alcohol abuse, for example), or when chronic illness care management calls for multiple and complex new behaviors and strategies (physical therapy after a stroke in a patient with diabetes and heart failure, for example).( [7](9_0.htm#7), [48](9_0.htm#48), [49](9_0.htm#49)) (See also the discussion of the Chronic Care Model below.) Patients easily become discouraged and disillusioned when the illness burden is heavy and the changes required for health are extensive. Maximizing success by identifying and encouraging small steps toward change is important, if not essential, for promoting patients' continuing engagement in the process of change. Before you close a session, assess patients' confidence to implement the plan. If patients' confidence ratings are less than 7, our clinical experience and the anecdotal experience of others in this field suggest that patients are unlikely to succeed. We thus suggest that you pursue 1 of 2 strategies: 1) continue to identify and resolve barriers until patients confidence is at least 7; or 2) renegotiate a goal that patients believe they can achieve, with a confidence of at least 7. |Case: Dr. W. assists Ms. D in designing an effective action plan| | | Dr. W. assists Ms. D. in exploring exercise strategies and resolving potential barriers to success, so that she feels confident she can accomplish this first step. Let's then continue with the previous case scenario to demonstrate some components of the Assist step. Ms. D: \"Well, I am not someone who likes to go to the gym. I enjoy walking, though.\" Dr.W: \"Walking is an excellent choice. Any thoughts about where you would like to walk?\" Ms. D: \"Well, I could walk in my neighborhood before or after work, or I guess I could stop at the high school on the way home I think I prefer walking in my neighborhood. We are new to the area and this might be a way to meet some neighbors.\" Dr. W: \"Great idea so walking in your neighborhood. I am filling out this Action Plan so we both have a record of what you are planning to do. Can you specify when you will walk?\" Ms. D: \"Hmmm. The best time for a walk will be after dinner. Maybe I can even get my husband to come with me.\" Dr. W: \"Having company and support can help. How many minutes do you want to walk .to start? Ms. D: \"Let's say 20 minutes.\" Dr. W: \"How many days each week?\" Ms. D: \"I think I better just start with 3 days this coming week.\" Dr. W: \"That sounds very achievable. Can you think of any down side or barriers to your plan?\" Ms. D: \"Well, my husband is in pretty good shape. He might want to walk too fast. I will have to ask him to be patient with me.\" Dr. W: \"It is fine to start out at a leisurely pace. Eventually, to promote weight loss, you will want to move up to a moderate pace a pace that produces a light sweat, but is slow enough so you can carry on a conversation. I can have Mary teach you to take your pulse too, if you are interested in getting more precise feedback about the level of activity that will help you to meet your goal of losing weight.\" Ms. D: \"Maybe I can work on taking my pulse another time. Keeping track of my level of exertion seems fine to me.\" Dr. W: \"That's fine any other barriers?\" Ms. D: \"No, I can't think of any. Dr. W: \"Ok, we have a plan. Would you like to review the plan with me?\" Ms. D: \"Sure .let's see I will walk for 20 minutes, 3 times a week, in my neighborhood after dinner, with my husband. I will start at a leisurely pace and gradually try to increase it. \" Dr. W: \"Excellent! So, how confident are you that you can implement your plan, on that scale of 0 10, where 0 is not at all confident and 10 is extremely confident?\" Ms. D: \"9. I could probably say 10, but I usually don't give 10s.\" Dr. W: \"Fair enough. Here is your copy of the plan.\" Discussion: In this case example, the physician assisted the patient to identify a specific, achievable plan, identified resources and barriers, and used problem solving strategies to address a barrier. |Assisting patients with low conviction, and/or low confidence| | | You will encounter many patients whose uncertainty about the need for change (low conviction), or uncertainty about their ability to change (low confidence) prevents them from making a decision to change. People have to have both strong conviction and at least a modicum of confidence before they will invest energy in working with you about learning how to change. Working on plans that focus on action in this circumstance is fruitless and usually quite frustrating for both clinicians and patients. For patients who reject even the idea of change (conviction=0-1, precontemplation), your task is first to give clear feedback and advice so that they know what you think they should change, and why, in order to improve management of their illness or condition and minimize the health risks. It is ineffective to argue or to try to persuade patients to do something that they do not believe is important to do. Evidence suggests that it may help for you to \"roll with resistance\", take in the patient's experience, beliefs and feelings and simply seek to understand their low level of conviction. Use of the conviction ruler (e.g., \"what makes it a 1 and not 0\" or even, \"Zero that's as low as you can get what would have to happen to make it a 1?\") may provide a slight opening for affirmation (\"So, you realize that there are some potential benefits to change\"). You may also recommend that patients read written information from you or on the web or newspapers or magazines, talk with people who have changed, discuss with a partner or family member, or simply pay attention to the details of their own behavior so as to discuss their feelings and the effects with you at a following visit. In short, moving from precontemplation to contemplation is an inner process that is dependent on feelings, inspiration, testimony, story, or example, and is little affected by logic and data such as a professional might give. As many as 60% of patients whose physicians think they should engage in new behavior or change an old behavior have plenty of information and express interest in changing, but are unable to decide and commit themselves to the process. They are in contemplation, and either have low (but not as low as 0-1) conviction OR low confidence. Once again, you could give clear advice (preferably after asking permission), but refrain from prematurely suggesting action plans or trying to persuade people. They can make progress if you nonjudgmentally help them to explore their ambivalence by using the conviction ruler, eliciting and discussing thepros and cons of changing and/or problem-solving with them about why they feel they cannot succeed. In short, shifting your focus from trying to induce change in these patients to trying to enhance conviction and confidence and move them to the next stage of change, constructs more success and minimizes frustration for you and your patients. This loosening of clinician \"control\" and broadening of perspective to include the patient's view creates new opportunities for finding common ground. You will find more information on these skills in the Appendix, below (\"For advanced clinicians\"), and in doc.com modules 24,25,29,30 (on smoking, alcohol, diet, exercise, and drugs). |Arrange follow up| | | Arrange follow up plans that include scheduled visits, and help patients make the appointments for consultants, or arrangements for education classes. Arranging follow-up visits, calls, and other ways of maintaining clinical contact, such as education classes, counselor and consultant visits, or contact with rehabilitation programs is the essential fifth component of the Five A's. Before closing the visit, it is helpful to seek verbal agreement from the patient on the details of the treatment or health behavior change plan. When arranging follow-up contacts, be specific about dates and times, and help patients arrange the details for following through with appointments. Many medical encounters are for specific and limited problems, such as a broken leg, a hernia repair, an episode of bronchitis. However, when you manage patients with chronic illness, or begin to address chronic health behavior risks with patients, you will adopt a longer-term perspective. Evidence from the research literature on chronic care management and health behavior change indicates that patients need multiple planned health care contacts to achieve the best outcomes. ( [7](9_0.htm#7), [22](9_0.htm#22), [41](9_0.htm#41), [49](9_0.htm#49), [50](9_0.htm#50)) (Follow-up is important even when the patient is in the precontemplation or contemplation stage, as brief advice, even during single contacts, may tip the balance for some patients, who go on to make important and lasting behavior change. ( [9](9_0.htm#9), [22](9_0.htm#22), [23](9_0.htm#23), [41](9_0.htm#41))) Strategies for success at closing visits and arranging follow up, with descriptions of additional skills are in doc.com module 12. |BEHAVIOR CHANGE CHECK LIST| | | The editors believe that the ASK-TELL-ASK technique presented in doc.com module 10 is of particular relevance for behavior change conversations. Dialogs about the 5 A's always involve reviewing patients' information and perspectives, presenting new information and exploring options, and demonstrating respect and empathy about patients' beliefs and ideas. We have labeled many of the 5 A skills with an Ask or a Tell in order to underscore this relevance. PREPARE ASSESS ADVISE AGREE ASSIST Modify and calibrate use of skills and strategies for different situations (Stages of Change), as follows: ARRANGE |APPENDIX: Additional text for advanced clinicians| | | This section of the module delineates evidence-based models of health behavior change and models for the optimal delivery of such interventions within the context of medical care. The models present additional evidence and describe strategies that we expect will assist advanced learners in organizing specific strategies that conform to your personal practice experience and preferences, and can be effectively added to your health system or office. |The Chronic Care/Planned Care Model| The Chronic Care Model (CCM), developed by Edward Wagner and colleagues at the MacColl Institute for Healthcare Innovation, has emerged as a key tool for understanding and harnessing forces that influence the delivery and quality of care.( [48-52](9_0.htm#48)) Recently, this model has been applied to preventive care as well.( [52](9_0.htm#52), [53](9_0.htm#53)). The overall goal of the CCM is to create an environment that supports \"productive interactions\" between \"informed activated patients\" and a \"prepared, proactive of clinicians.( [48-50](9_0.htm#48)) (see figure 2 below) \"Self-management support\", a key component of the CCM, is defined as a patient-centered, collaborative approach to care that promotes patient activation, education and empowerment. ( [50](9_0.htm#50), [52](9_0.htm#52), [53](9_0.htm#53)) The developers of the CCM put the concept of self-management support into the key position in their model to emphasize that patients with a chronic condition must manage their illness between health care visits, literally from day to day, if not moment to moment. The elements of self-management support include: 1) Assessment of beliefs, behavior and knowledge; 2) Collaborative goal setting; 3) Identification of personal barriers and supports; 4) Problem-solving; and 5) Developing a personal action plan that is based on the previous 4 steps. ( [7](9_0.htm#7)) Figure 2: Model for Improving Chronic Illness Care The CCM is compatible with other models of patient-centered care.( [1](9_0.htm#1), [54,55](9_0.htm#54)) In addition to \"Self-Management Support\", the CCM specifies five other factors that influence \"productive interactions\" between patients and clinicians: 1) delivery system design (e.g., planned regular visits for patients with chronic illness, follow-up telephone contact for patients making a behavioral change; 2) decision support (e.g., care guidelines available at the point of care, clinician training; 3) information systems (e.g., patient registries, computerized reminder systems for patients and clinicians; 4) overall organization of health care (e.g., leadership); and 5) community linkages and resources.( [48-50](9_0.htm#48)) (see figure 2 above) |Review of evidence-based self-management interventions| and Kinmonth, in a evidence-based self-management interventions in diabetes care, ( [8](9_0.htm#8)) identified several principles for promoting productive patient-centered interactions between clinicians and patients. | | Table 3: Principles of Effective Communication (Modified from ( [8])) See the table above for an adapted version of these principles, which may be applied to promote patient adherence and health behavior change across a variety of medical conditions and patient populations. The patient-centered collaborative nature of this approach is evident in its emphasis on understanding and patients' experience and showing empathy for them, negotiating goals and helping patients to identify and overcome barriers to adherence and behavior change. These principles and strategies are echoed in other reviews of successful strategies for promoting self-management and health behavior change ( [7](9_0.htm#7), [9](9_0.htm#9), [30](9_0.htm#30), [47](9_0.htm#47), [56-58](9_0.htm#56)) Next, we briefly describe several models of behavior change that have informed the development of effective brief health behavior counseling interventions. Some aspects of these models are cited above and many are incorporated into the 5 A's model. |Models of Health Behavior Change and Brief Health Behavior Counseling| Social Cognitive Theory (also known as Social Learning Theory) posits that behavior change and maintenance are a function of an individual's: 1) outcome expectations (i.e., beliefs about what outcomes could result from engaging in a behavior); and 2) efficacy expectations (self-efficacy) (i.e., beliefs about how capable or confident one is of performing specific behaviors in specific situations).( [28](9_0.htm#28), [29](9_0.htm#28)) Said more simply, one's beliefs about the likelihood of an outcome and one's feelings of confidence about achieving an outcome are strong determinants of that outcome. Thus, interventions that increase a person's self-efficacy (e.g., skills training with an opportunity to practice in real-world settings) will improve behavioral outcomes. Reciprocal determinism, another principle of Social Cognitive Theory, holds that there is a reciprocal interaction between personal factors, behavior, and the environment such that a change in any one of these elements has an influence on the other. Thus, success resulting from a behavior (e.g using a relaxation strategy to avoid smoking) may increase self-efficacy, which will improve one's subsequent ability to maintain abstinence from smoking. The environment exerts an effect on behavior in a variety of ways, including modeling, a powerful determinant of behavior change. Thus, repeated exposure to positive role models, such as peers with effective coping repertoires, promotes adoption of healthy behaviors. Self-determination theory is a theory of human motivation that distinguishes between motivations that are autonomous versus controlled. ( [30](9_0.htm#30)) Carefully designed and controlled studies show that autonomous, or internal, motivation is associated with improved adherence and improvements in diabetes care. ( [30](9_0.htm#30), [31](9_0.htm#30)) Moreover, clinicians who support patient autonomy and offer advice and treatment options \"without pressure or demand\" in a non-controlling, non-authoritarian way promote enhanced adherence and health behavior change. ( [30](9_0.htm#30), [31](9_0.htm#30)) [33](9_0.htm#32), [59](9_0.htm#59)) is an approach to patient counseling that is compatible with all the models noted above. Rollnick and Miller have defined Motivational Interviewing as \"as a directive, client-centered counseling style for eliciting behavior change by helping clients to explore and resolve ambivalence\". ( [32](9_0.htm#32)) Motivational Interviewing was initially developed as an intervention targeting problematic alcohol and substance use. ( [60](9_0.htm#59)) However, it is now increasingly being applied to other behaviors, including counseling to prevent HIV infection. ( [32](9_0.htm#32), [59-61](9_0.htm#32)) Miller and Rollnick describe four general principles which underlie this approach: | | Table 4: Principles of Motivational Interviewing (From ( [32](9_0.htm#32))) Empathic warmth is perhaps the most important element of motivational interviewing. (60) Specific skills and strategies associated with this approach include open-ended questions (particularly about the patients beliefs, values, expectations and feelings), much reflective listening, legitimization of patients' feelings, affirmation of attempts to cope and manage, and support of the patient's autonomy and right to choose or reject change. Exploration of ambivalence is especially important as a tool for understanding the barriers and obstacles to change. ( [59](9_0.htm#59)) Being genuinely curious about the patient and being willing to put aside one's agenda (at least temporarily) help clinicians understand and accept patients situation and express empathy for them. Developing discrepancy is accomplished by raising patients' awareness of the consequences of their present behavior and highlighting the discrepancy between their present behavior and their own personal priorities, values and goals. Wherever possible, patients are encouraged to identify their own reasons for change. When expressions of commitment, or change talk, are elicited or spontaneously expressed, the clinician provides affirmation and support to help build and deepen commitment. ( [32](9_0.htm#32)) The clinician should avoid argumentation as arguments are counterproductive, serving typically to engage patients' defensiveness, to encourage them to \"fight back\" and to exaggerate their resistance to exploring and experimenting with behavior change. Rolling with resistance involves backing off when the patient expresses resistance by acknowledging that change is difficult while also inviting the patient to consider new information or perspectives without imposing the clinician's ideas. Clinicians support self efficacy by helping patients to build on past successes and by collaboratively offering a range of alternative approaches and choices for taking the next step. The full expression and use of these strategies generally means that therapists need 30-60 minutes and a single-minded focus, both of which are unusual in typical medical encounters, so clinicians developed variants of MI for use in typical medical settings. |Brief versions of Motivational Interviewing| Brief versions of Motivational Interviewing have been developed for use by clinicians in primary care and other health care settings [ [33](9_0.htm#33), [34](9_0.htm#33), [62](9_0.htm#62)]. These have been well described, but convincing studies of their efficacy are not yet available. They emphasize strategies to build rapport (i.e., open-ended inquiry, reflective listening and empathy), assessment of patients' stage of change and the two dimensions of motivation we have already discussed above: (1) conviction or importance regarding the need for change; and (2) confidence or self-efficacy about taking action. Clinicians follow a careful assessment with tailored counseling that utilizes specific strategies that seek to foster and increase patients' levels of conviction and confidence. As a general rule, if both conviction and confidence are low, investigators suggest that it is most efficient to focus on enhancing conviction first. After all, most patients have to believe it is important to change or adhere before they will be willing to invest energy in learning how to change. For patients with low conviction, effective counseling strategies include: providing information and structured feedback about patients' specific situation (with patients' permission); exploring ambivalence; and providing a menu of options for treatment and follow-up. The menu might include behaviors that reflect small steps toward change (e.g., reducing the number of cigarettes smoked per day; using condoms some of the time). Patients not ready to commit to any action towards change may be encouraged to continue to think about the possibilities for change while being told that help is available when they are ready to take action. For patients with low confidence, strategies include: reviewing past experience, especially successes; teaching problem-solving and coping skills; and encouraging small steps that are likely to lead to initial success. Table 4 summarizes these strategies. | | Table 4: Principles of Motivational Interviewing (From [ [32]]) Readers will notice that many of them are incorporated in the 5 A's model, but specified in more detail and in a somewhat more focused fashion in this section; furthermore, these strategies rely on many principles of effective communication recommended by Roter and Kinmonth (see Table 3 below), and stressed in the \"Essential Elements\" modules of doc.com. | | Table 3: Principles of Effective Communication (Modified from [ [8]]) |Integration of the 5A's with the Chronic Care Model| Figure 4 below illustrates an integration of Self-Management Support with the 5A's counseling approach. ( [7](9_0.htm#7)) Figure 4: Integration of Self-Management Support with the 5A's In this integration, each of the 5 A's is associated with one of the key elements of self-management support. Figure 2: The Chronic Care Model If you reference the complete Chronic Care Model shown in Figure 2, you are reminded that self-management support is but one of several elements within the level of the health care organization that interact synergistically to promote \"Productive Interactions\" between a \"Prepared Proactive Practice Team\" and an Informed Activated Patient. Thus, improved health outcomes will be more broadly and deeply realized only when clinicians deliver effective patient-centered health behavior counseling (Tables [3](5_30.htm), [4](5_40.htm), and [5](5_50.htm)) within a context of care that includes all of the key elements of the Chronic Care Model. |TABLES| In this section you'll find the following tables: |Table 1 - Barriers to Health Behavior Counseling| | | By Patients | | By Clinicians |Not knowledgeable about risks||Not enough time in visit| |Unaware of more acceptable options for change||Not trained in counseling| |Lacks social support for change||Frustration with those not ready to change| |Feels too stressed to change||Uncomfortable giving up control over goals and options for change| |Lacks confidence from prior failures||Difficulty feeling comfortable with less than perfect plan| |Lacks support and understanding||Difficulty listening to patient perspectives| |Feels ashamed or guilty about behavior and therefore responds defensively||Difficulty expressing empathy for patient's distress| |Table 2 - The 5 A's| | | (Modified from ( [9](9_0.htm#9))) |Table 3 - Principles of Effective Communication| | | (Modified from ( [8](9_0.htm#8))) |Table 4 - Principles of Motivational Interviewing| | | (From ( [32](9_0.htm#32))) |Table 5 - Principles of Patient-Centered Counseling| | | For low conviction: For low confidence: |FIGURES| In this section you'll find the following figures: |Figure 5: | AAPP Doc.Com Video- Skills Checklist for Behavior Change and Adherence Counseling | Scoring Method: | | | Communication Strategy/Skill: | | Performed? | | Comments: | | Yes Score 1-3 | | No Score 0 | | 1.

Braddock III, MD, MPH | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | Clarence H. MPH |The View| |The Doctor's Reflection:| |EVOLUTION OF CONCEPT OF SHARED DECISION-MAKING| | | Recent acceleration in medical science and research left patients and potential research subjects with limited understanding of facts and potential implications of decisions about their health. A Presidential commission addressed these issues and articulated both the ethics and the process of getting people more involved with their own health. Science and technology advanced at a rapid pace in the past few decades. Understanding information relevant to decisions about health became increasingly difficult for the lay public, and particularly for patients faced with the need to decide in situations that were urgent or carried lifelong implications. In the early 1980's a Presidential Advisory Panel convened to address some of the complexity introduced by the rapid advance in knowledge and technology. This panel, on informed consent in health care and research, introduced the phrase \"shared decision-making.\" They advised: Ethically valid consent is a process of shared decision-making based upon mutual respect and participation, not a ritual to be equated with reciting the contents of a form that details the risks of a particular treatment. ( [1]) Shared decision-making acknowledges patients' central role in making decisions about their own health care. The clinician's primary role is to make health care recommendations based on the desire to promote patients' well-being. The clinician's second obligation is to help patients obtain and understand the information relevant to a particular health decision, and to facilitate their active participation in making the most informed decision possible. We emphasize that the clinician's obligation goes beyond a unilateral disclosure of risks and benefits, and includes the specific intention to foster patient understanding, as well as targeted interventions to accomplish this intention. |CONCEPT OF SHARED DECISION-MAKING DERIVES FROM FUNDAMENTAL ETHICAL PRINCIPLES| | | The ethical principles of respect for persons, respect for autonomy, and promotion of patient well-being (beneficence) form the foundation for the concept of shared decision-making. The interactional and communication processes that drive the implementation of the concept derive from these ethical principles. The principle of respect for persons derives from the view that people are valuable in their own right. Thus, clinicians have an obligation to show respect for the intrinsic value of each individual. One way in which the clinician can show respect is by fostering the meaningful participation of patients in decision-making. The concept of autonomy is central to Western ethical traditions. An expression of respect for autonomy in the clinical context involves acknowledging and supporting patients' right to make decisions that affect their bodies. The principle of promotion of patient well-being, often called beneficence, is a central tenet of clinical medicine. As clinicians, we are guided by a professional obligation to use our knowledge and skills to evaluate patient concerns and make recommendations for beneficial health care interventions. In some situations, you and your patients may define \"benefit\" substantially differently. Using the example of blood pressure control, medication side effects may affect quality of life so much that patients no longer perceive any net benefit. The purpose of shared decision-making is to facilitate patients' role in determining the meaning of \"benefit\" in their own heath care decisions. |THE PATIENT'S ROLE| | | Most patients want information, but some patients want clinicians to make important decisions for them, and some patients will defer to family. Ask your patients about their preferences. In general 70-80% of patients, when asked their preference for involvement in decision making, express a desire to be informed and to have a say in the choice of medical treatment. ( [2,3,4](9_0.htm#2)) Nevertheless, some patients may be reluctant to participate, either because they truly would rather delegate decision making authority to the physician, or because they simply feel overwhelmed or unaccustomed to the task. Hence it is important to inquire about the patient's preference for a role in decision making. Checking regularly with patients will help you ascertain that you are not overburdening them with complex explanations, statements laden with medical jargon, or excessive detail in discussions of alternatives, risks, benefits, or uncertainties, and insures that your dialog is both relationship-centered and efficient. (see module 10) Among patients of other cultural backgrounds, the default preference for involvement in decision making may not hold true. Rather, there may be traditions of allowing other family members to make decisions, or to withhold certain information on diagnosis and prognosis from the patient. Remain open to those patients who have a different view of how clinical decisions should be made. Additionally, do not make assumptions about patients' desired level of involvement, ask them. |Inviting patient involvement| | | Balance your invitation, help patients understand what you mean, and encourage patients to think out loud. Many patients are not accustomed to playing a role in clinical decision making. Patients may worry that you will be offended if they ask too many questions or seem to question your opinion or advice. They may also feel overwhelmed by the medical information, and embarrassed to admit this to you. For these reasons, talk with patients about the ways in which you will support and enable them to have a meaningful role. As you talk, balance your encouragement, so that you neither force involvement, and nor inadvertently discourage a role. \"You need to be involved with this decision,\" may be too forceful. \"You could also be a part of this decision,\" may suggest that you don't really want them involved. The best metaphor for encouraging the patient's involvement is to think of it as an invitation: \"I really want to give you a chance to share your thoughts about this too.\" Even with such an invitation, some patients may be quite uncertain what your intentions are, or what you want from them. One technique that can help is to suggest patients \"think aloud.\" \"What you are thinking right now?\" If they can make their thinking transparent to you, you gain insight into their level of understanding, potentially finding key areas you can clarify. You can also uncover areas that you have not yet discussed, such as specific worries this patient might have. Addressing these concerns foster both patients' understanding and their level of comfort with the decision. |FRAMEWORK AND SKILLS FOR SMOOTHLY FOLLOWING UP YOUR INVITATION| | | Learn and practice this general framework and the related skills: Invite patients to participate; Describe relevant information about the issue/problem; Delineate alternative courses of action that could be taken; Describe relevant information about the pros & cons of alternatives; Present information about uncertainties inherent in the situation; Assess patients' understanding; Ascertain patients' preferences for action Many patients will accept your invitation to actively collaborate with you about important decisions. Patients' need for information and their ability to handle it, the medical complexity of the information you seek to help them understand and the urgency, importance and meaning of the situation vary tremendously. Is this a prevention discussion with a highly educated patient (\"Your cholesterol is high,\") an urgent surgical situation for someone who speaks little English (\"Your infected gallbladder should be taken out now,\") a proxy decision with a very worried parent (\"Your baby is very jaundiced and needs hospitalization,\") or a simple matter with a retail clerk (\"I do not think you need an antibiotic for your cold\")? Having a general framework in mind to remind you of the relevant elements and their associated skills enables you to flexibly handle this array of everyday situations competently, efficiently and in a personalized fashion that respects each person. The elements that you will include in your informed decision making conversations appear in the following list: |Adjust your interventions to the situations' complexity| | | Dialog will be longer or shorter, and the completeness with which you carry out the steps will vary according to your relationship with patients, their past experience with related decisions and the complexity of the situation. Clearly the extent of dialogue necessary to foster informed participation will vary. Additional factors influencing the dialogue needed would be the length of your relationship with a patient, the patient's experience with prior similar decisions and his or her cognitive ability. Importantly, the nature and complexity of the decision will strongly impact the extent of discussion. ( [5](9_0.htm#5)) For some decisions of low complexity, only an abbreviated discussion is needed, letting the patient know what you would like to do and asking them if that will be all right. Some level of discussion of the nature of the decision is always necessary, such as, \"I'd like to order a blood count to make sure you're not anemic.\" For many such basic decisions, there will be minimal if any \"risk,\" and the alternatives are rather limited, such as not ordering a blood count. Thus it is not crucial to routinely discuss these elements. The conversation should, however, leave open the door for patient questions or concerns, such that when the discussion is complete, patients have their information needs met. For basic decisions, this can be accomplished by merely asking, for instance, \"Does that sound all right?\" The typical very complex example is a surgical procedure, in which there is substantial risk and clear alternatives. Here the need for exploration is greater. For the most complex decisions, explicit discussion of alternatives, risks and benefits, and a full exploration of the patient's level of understanding and their opinion would be essential. Many decisions, such as prescribing a new medication, may need a level of discussion intermediate to these two extremes. |Skills you will find useful for these conversations| | | Some framings and phrases effectively convey your intention, the meaning of the situation and your personal concern that patients get what they want and need. Learning key phrases and practicing them increase trust and satisfaction through fostering a successful informed decision making process. Your invitation to patients \"This is really a decision we should make together\" \"It will be important to me to hear your thoughts about this too.\" Description of the nature of the decision A clear statement of what is at issue helps clarify what is being decided upon and allows physicians to share their preliminary thoughts. \"What we need to decide is...\" \"The issue for us today is...\" Delineating alternatives A decision always has options, including the option of doing nothing at all. Taking a moment to make this explicit insures better patient understanding of the situation. \"You could try the new medication or continue the medication you are taking.\" Description of the pros and cons- benefits and risks Clinicians frequently present the pros of one option and the cons of another, without fully exploring the pros and cons of each. A more balanced presentation assures that patients' decisions will be better informed. \"The new medication is more expensive. But you only need to take it once a day.\" Present information about uncertainties While sometimes difficult, a discussion of uncertainties is crucial for the patient's comprehensive understanding about the options. Thoughtful discussion can promote trust and encourage compliance. \"There is a good chance that this will help you.\" \"This works well for most patients.\" \"There is a small chance maybe 1 out of 20 - of infection from this.\" Assess patients' understanding Once the core information is provided and core disclosures are made, physicians must check in with patients to know if what they have said so far makes sense. As emphasized above, fostering understanding is the central goal of informed decision making. \"Do you follow where I am going with this?\" \"Does what I say make sense to you?\" \"Are you with me so far?\" Ascertain patient preferences for next steps Experience demonstrates that many patients need encouragement to actually state an opinion, particularly if they disagree with physicians' initial recommendations. A common clinician error with serious consequences is to assume that silence means that patients do not disagree, and \"consent\" to your plan. Patients who disagree and do not say so are less likely to adhere to decisions, and (for example,) may not show up for their scheduled consultation or biopsy, increasing costs, adding delays and unnecessary frustration and inefficiencies Make certain that your patients know that you wish to air any disagreements and that you will listen and explore possible alternatives graciously, including giving them more time to consider their options, consult their loved ones, and so on. \"Does that sound ok with you?\" \"What do you think?\" \"What would seem like the right course of action?\" \"How do you feel about that?\" |EXAMPLES OF SHARED DECISION MAKING| |Complexity of decision|| | Poor example | | Better example |Basic: | obtaining a complete blood count |\"I'd like to check some blood tests.

What is the difference between them? Is it sometimes appropriate for physicians to frame medical decisions in this way? |CONCLUSION| | | The goal of informed decision making is to foster the patient's informed participation in decisions about their health. Informed decision-making rests on the ethical principles of respect for persons and autonomy, and promotion of patient well-being. Moreover, there is growing evidence in the medical literature that involving patients in decision making promotes trust, higher levels of satisfaction, and can contribute to good clinical outcomes. Several recent studies confirm that most patients would prefer a role in decision making. Do not make assumptions about your patients' desired level of involvement. Remain open to those patients who have a different view of how clinical decisions should be made. To practice informed decision-making effectively, physicians need both a framework to guide such discussions and the communication skills to implement these conversations. Key elements of informed decision making include: Invite patients to participate; describe the decision; delineate alternatives; describe pros & cons of alternatives; present information about uncertainties; assess patients' understanding; ascertain patients' preferences. Recognizing that clinical decisions differ in complexity, the extent of discussion of a decision should vary as well. |BEHAVIOR SKILLS CHECKLIST| |LITERATURE REFERENCES| |Welcome to doc.com Module Asking about Sexuality |by Richard M. Frankel Ph.D., Sarah Williams M.D., Elizabeth Edwardsen M.D. | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | Patient's |Learning goals:| |INTRODUCTION: EVIDENCE ABOUT SEXUALITY IN MEDICAL PRACTICE| | | Evidence shows that inquiry about sexuality and sexual behavior, as well as examinations of breasts, rectum and genitals remain problematic for many physicians. In addition, physicians' opportunities to talk about their clinical experiences with the topic of sexuality, their own sexuality and sexual feelings in the practice of medicine, are limited. These problems may greatly diminish the quality of patients' care. You've just taken over Dr. Smith's practice and are seeing a long-term patient for blood pressure management. The patient is very friendly, and comments on your clothing, your new office d\u00e9cor and the fact that you do not wear a wedding ring. You notice that the blood pressure medication was changed last visit because it was causing sexual dysfunction; your anxiety rises as you anticipate that you'll need to do a sexual history. In this module we identify basic principles of taking the sexual history. We offer a framework for approaching the interview and some practical suggestions for ways to normalize sexual history and make it a routine. Second, we focus on special situations, such as interviewing patients with STD's, and chronic illnesses or situations that may lead to sexual problems. Third, we explore physician sexuality and personal issues that inhibit treating patients appropriately. |PRINCIPLES OF SEXUAL HISTORY TAKING| | | In this section, we'll cover the following: |When to ask about sex| | | Evidence suggests that many patients have questions about their sexual functioning that they would like to discuss with their physician. Like other sensitive topics, (living wills, costs, etc.), patients strongly prefer that the conversation be initiated by the clinician. Patients are unlikely to bring these topics up spontaneously. During any visit that includes past medical history, social history and systems review you will ask questions about sexual health and function routinely, just as you ask about alcohol, drugs, relationships and other sensitive topics. In less comprehensive visits, you will ask these questions when the \"present illness\" relates in any way to genitourinary function (including possible pregnancy), when sexually transmitted infections are a consideration, or when you had recently started patients on medications that may impair sexual functioning. Of course, you will address all aspects of sexual health and function whenever the patient's visit is precipitated by a sexual concern or problem. Some patients will refer indirectly or obliquely to questions about sexual functioning. For example, a patient recently put on medication for high blood pressure may ask in general terms about side effects or express concerns about physical activity. Often Ask a follow up question to ascertain whether the patient is worried about sexual function, and attend carefully to the non-verbal aspects of the communication. |What is the most respectful way to ask about sex?| | | Learn the health reasons for asking about sex, the usual questions you will need, and helpful transition statements. Social scientists point out that sexual mores differ from culture to culture, sometimes making it difficult to discern the limits of propriety and decency. For example, it would be very unusual for a woman to see a male physician about her sexual health in many cultures. Likewise, displaying parts of the body such as the soles of one's feet is considered the equivalent of \"exposing oneself\" in some cultures. Understanding that norms differ, even within your own culture, is important in your providing a safe context for talk about sexual health and functioning. Your ease in taking a sexual history is related to your own level of comfort with this portion of the visit. Learning the typical and appropriate questions, and becoming clear about why you are asking about sexuality are important steps you can take to reduce your own anxieties in this situation. Just as you learned to listen to the heart and eventually were able to detect subtle signs through repeated exposure, practice is the most important key to competence in this arena. Most patients appreciate that questions about sex may provoke some tension or embarrassment (particularly for student learners), and a transition statement such as, \"Now I'm going to ask you some questions about your sexual health,\" and, \"These are questions I ask all patients and are important for your health,\" usually readies both you and your patient to discuss this material. |What questions should I ask?| | | Below are recommended questions for the routine sexual history. Usually, clinicians ask about sexuality during the psychosocial history. Some questions should be routine, others asked if patients indicate that there are issues about their sexuality they would like to discuss. |Check out the video example about \"taking the sexual history\" on the left.| Routine questions: | | \"Is there someone special in your life? Are you and this person having sex?\" \"Are you satisfied with your sex life?\" Or, \"are there any problems or concerns about your sexual functioning that you'd like to discuss?\" Do you have other sexual partners? (are you monogamous, have multiple partners, casual partners)? \"It's important that I ask some questions to assess your risk of sexually transmitted diseases or HIV: Have you been having any high risk sex? (injection drug users, cocaine users, prostitutes, gay or bisexual men)?\" \"Has your illness affected your sexual functioning?\" Some experts recommend asking, \"Do you have sex with men, women, or both?\" However, frequently patients will tell you this information in answering the questions above. Attend to the timing of discussions of sexuality and sexual functioning. Ideally, the patient and provider should be seated comfortably and at ease. If using an electronic medical record, keep note taking to a minimum and give full visual and non-verbal attention to the patient. Sometimes when you ask patients if they have any sexual problems or concerns, they will answer \"no,\" but seem hesitant in their responses. Monitoring both verbal and non-verbal behavior to detect signs of anxiety or ambivalence about discussing sexually related problems. It can be helpful to notice that: \"You seem a little doubtful.\" \"I get the feeling that everything isn't so great.\" Many patients will then be encouraged to reveal their concerns. For some patients, a statement about confidentiality will be helpful, \"Everything we talk about will remain between you and me.\" Many situations will require that you ask more details, such as the questions below: | | \"Are you using condoms to prevent disease? What percent of the time? \"Do you have any other sexual relationships that I should know about?\" \"Do you have difficulty having an orgasm?\" \"Do you use any sexual performance enhancing medications (Viagra, etc)? If so, how frequently?\" Gender-specific questions: | | Men: | | Women: | | \"Do you have any problems developing or maintaining an erection?\" \"Do you have trouble ejaculating too soon, or not soon enough?\" (For men with erectile dysfunction): | | \"Do you have any pain during intercourse?\" \"Do you have problems with lubrication?\" |How can I respectfully explore details and the context of sexual issues?| | | The best strategy to get more details is to tell patients that you would like to explore further with them, in this or in a subsequent visit. Many sexual issues involve the broader psychosocial context. | | Check out the video example about \"the context of sexual issues\" on the left. Often when patients bring up sexual problems, they are associated with other problems in their relationships or in their lives. Respectfully asking patients to say more, and simply listening to them often provides an opportunity for helpful ventilation of feelings, and for revealing information that will help you decide on next steps. It is critical to listen and respond non-judgmentally and with empathy to these very sensitive issues. As you transition to exploring the context in which the problem is experienced, some closed and some open questions that will help you respectfully get important medical and contextual details are listed below: | | When did you first become aware of this problem? Has the problem occurred before? Does the problem occur all of the time or just some of the time? (If there are multiple partners,) does it occur with all partners or just some partners? What feelings does the problem raise in you? How has your partner(s) been responding? What have you tried to address to this problem? Has anyone tried to hurt you or force you to have sex now or in the past? Sometimes patients will share information about maladaptive behaviors. In those cases, provide a rationale for continuing the conversation e.g., \"I'd like to talk with you (today/next time) about your having unprotected sex with men and women because it carries increased risk for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV infection.\" State that your interest is in their health risk; not in their sexual preferences or life choices, and reinforce that any information shared will be confidential. Be aware that further inquiry about maladaptive behavior in the moment may interrupt the patient from continuing the story and limit your understanding of what is going on in the patient's life. If you feel that you don't yet fully understand the context of illness, simply flag the issue for later discussion and encourage the patient to continue. |Talking to patients about HIV/AIDS or STDS| | | Stigma and guilt are associated with HIV and other STDs and with behaviors associated with transmission of these diseases. Clinicians are not immune to related negative feelings about the diseases or the behaviors. When clinicians' and patients' ambivalent or judgmental feelings collide, defensiveness, irritation and anger frequently surface. In most societies, sexually transmitted illnesses are shameful, and people who carry them are stigmatized, especially if the infections were acquired by disapproved sexual activity (outside of marriage, or through anonymous homosexual or heterosexual encounters, for example). For people with HIV/AIDS or at risk of contracting it, a fear of having a dreaded disease contributes further to the complexity of interviews. Where there is shame, there is often guilt. This is certainly true for patients with STDS and HIV/AIDS, particularly if the infection was contracted through behavior that goes against their moral or religious beliefs. | | Check out the video example about \"embarassement and guilt\" on the left. This video is an excerpt of a longer video from doc.com module 5. The physician on camera is Auguste Fortin. Guilt may be stronger if the infected person is putting someone else at risk because of the behavior, for example, a man who contracted HIV through IV drug use or sex with prostitutes, and is continuing to have unprotected sex with his wife. It is always a good idea to provide patients a chance to talk about their feelings(m 3, 6, 13) once the behavior and situation have been adequately understood; and this is never more true than when in dialogue with patients about HIV or other STDs. Because issues related to STDs and HIV are so sensitive, your questions must be framed in non-judgmental language, and your non-verbal communications should be congruent, and neutral in tone. Many patients are already fearful of having HIV/AIDS, even when the actual likelihood of being infected is unclear. While you can't change that probability by how you talk with patients, they are very sensitive to the nuances of your communications. Take extra steps to maintain a professional and objective stance, so that you avoid any implication that the probability is high, and avoid frightening patients unnecessarily. Interviews are also complicated because these diseases, the behaviors through which they are contracted, and the fact that they can be transmitted to \"innocent bystanders\" bring clinicians' fears, ambivalence, or judgments to the surface. Whatever you may feel about someone who engages in such behavior, it is not helpful to convey your judgments. Come to terms with any evaluative feelings you have about these diseases and the associated behaviors. If you have not, then your non-verbal signals will convey the judgments that you feel. The patient will see your mixed message, and will correctly believe that your non verbal communication conveys the truth about how you feel. Sending mixed messages confuses patients and diminishes trust. Again, practice, feedback and experience bring comfort and skill to your interviews about sex and sexual functioning. |Talking about sex after patients' surgery, or with those who have chronic illnesses| | | Fear and symbolic effects of illness and surgery on sexuality usually cause patients more difficulty than physical effects. Medications' effects on sexual function are diverse and frequent. Elicit details about the situation, and then explore feelings and relationships. As stressed earlier in this module, patients seldom initiate conversations about sexuality, so physicians should do so with chronically ill or post surgery patients, and those affected by medications. Be sure you ask directly, \"how has this illness affected your sexual function?\" If there are problems, ask about the details, and explore the patient's emotions and the effects of the problem on the relationship. Chronic diseases and surgery affect sexuality in a number of ways, including mechanical (e.g., arthritis, surgical wounds), physiological (e.g., fatigue or shortness of breath), or direct (e.g., endocrine or neurological disorders.) More often overlooked are the effects of illness and surgery on self image and self esteem, and on a patients' sense of themselves as attractive, \"whole\", men or women. For example, a colostomy or disfiguring surgery may diminish the sense of body integrity and cause people to fear they're repellant to their partner, while a woman who has just had a hysterectomy or mastectomy may worry about her identity and value as a woman. Myocardial infarctions and open heart surgery are frightening for both men and women, as they fear that sexual activity may precipitate another heart attack or cause other damage. Recall that for many patients the emotional and symbolic effects of illness or surgery are more powerful than the physical effects on sexuality. This commonly occurs following an MI or cardiac surgery that affects men's sense of masculinity. Many drugs used for chronic illnesses can affect sexual function (usually desire, erection or arousal, or, primarily in women, orgasm). Additional interviewing points for these patients are the following: | | Be aware that emotional and symbolic effects are usually more devastating than the more obvious physical effects. Do not make assumptions, (for example that a person with a disfiguring or debilitating illness is not interested in sex), inquire. Get specific and appropriately detailed information about the behaviors and situation, and then ask about feelings. It may be awkward for young clinicians to ask about these details of sexual relations, but if you ask about them directly, patients will often answer directly. For example, does the patient with severe arthritis have difficulty opening her hips, or bending her knees? Have she and her partner talked about alternative positions, and is he willing to try these? If there is a lack of excitement or desire, does this seem due to pain, or fatigue, both, or neither? And so on. Then you can and should ask how she's feeling about the situation, how it's affecting the relationship with her husband, and what her worries or questions might be. Be especially vigilant about the effects of major life stressors such as divorce, re-marriage, or spousal or family health on sexual functioning; and about the relationship of such events to patients facing or undergoing surgery. |Talking with teenagers about sexuality, STDS and pregnancy| | | Teenagers need healthcare providers who are trustworthy, empathic listeners, and who give good practical advice. When interviewing adolescents and young adults, ensure and emphasize confidentiality, initiate the topic of sex, give advice and sexual information respectfully and without condescension, and pay particular attention to inquiry about sexual coercion or abuse. | | Check out the video example about \"interviewing a teen about sexuality\" on the left. Teenagers are working out who they are and sexuality is a big part of this process. However smart and sophisticated teens may seem, they are still developing the ability to make good decisions, balance risks and benefits, consider future consequences, and perform other \"executive functions\". Despite this immaturity and also because of it, teenagers react strongly to advice, even when it's thoughtful and well-intentioned. They are sensitive to condescension, being treated like children, or being criticized. They tend to somewhat distrust adults, andoften rightfully sofear that what they tell clinicians will get back to their parents. Therefore, the first rule is to ensure confidentiality. At the same time, most teenagers respond positively if you convey a genuine interest in their experience and opinions, and a respect for the maturity they do have. It may be helpful to start with closed questions that help you get a clear sense of the behavior or situation, and then open the interview up for the patient to ask questions, or voice concerns. Keep in mind that most teenagers are embarrassed by talk about the details of sexual behavior, so be gentle in your questioning, and ask if it is ok to ask for more details, if they are needed to understand the nature of the problem. Sex education delivered in a factual nonjudgmental way is also helpful, as many teenagers lack realistic, accurate information about sexual functions, pregnancy and birth control, and STDs. They appreciate getting reliable, frank, information from someone they trust, laid out in a way that respectfully allows them to consider it and make their own decisions. Written resources are particularly helpful in presenting this complex and sometimes embarrassing or disturbing information. It may be helpful to have the discussion of sexuality and sexual behavior over time, a luxury that most primary care physicians can offer their patients. If you think that a teen is at high risk, have the discussion in the index visit. Finally, most teenagers are concerned with projecting the right image. Knowing little and without experience, most young people find it difficult to clarify their needs and desires, much less express them. Girls are often the ones in position to say \"no\" or \"yes\" to older boys' or men's demands, and are especially vulnerable to unhappy, coercive or even abusive sexual experiences. Remain alert for clues to the possibility that patients are in a tough situation sexually, and need an opportunity to talk. It is often important to ask directly about this. \"What happens when you and your boyfriend argue?\" \"Does he ever threaten you or hit you?\" \"Are you ever in a situation where he forces you to have sex?\" In a future module, we will thoroughly discuss how to diagnose and respond to physical and sexual abuse. |THE PHYSICIAN'S OWN SEXUALITY| | | In this section, we'll cover the following: |Sexuality and sexual feelings| | | Conscious and unconscious feelings around sexuality can interfere with your communication and distort your relationships with patients. Sexual feelings occur in the everyday lives of doctors, nurses, therapists and patients alike. They occur normally and naturally when professionals interact with patients and with one another. Problems arise when normal sexual feelings become distorted, projected or acted out in the professional-client relationship. Conscious and unconscious thoughts and feelings around sexuality often interfere with the delivery of recommended physical examinations and treatment. It is not unusual, especially early in their careers, for male clinicians to \"defer\" doing breast, rectal or pelvic exams in young women, and for female clinicians to leave out doing genital or rectal exams in young men. Many physicians, because of feelings of attraction or fears related to sexuality or cultural norms are inhibited in asking about patients' sexual health. At the other end of the spectrum are physicians who cross boundaries and engage in sexual relationships with patients. These inappropriate relationships and can lead to devastating consequences for both parties. All clinicians, especially trainees, must have opportunities to discuss their concerns around sexuality in clinical care and to work out strategies for addressing these concerns in order to deliver appropriate patient care. |Relationship Boundaries and Professionalism| | | Boundaries are the implicit or explicit limits that allow for a safe professional connection between a physician and patient. Boundary confusion occurs when the clinician or the patient becomes aware of unusual feelings about sexual issues in the relationship. In one study 72% of 392 psychiatry residents, (86% of men and 52% of women) reported sexual attraction to patients. (Gattrell et. al. 1988) Boundary crossings occur when physicians or patients begin acting upon their sexual feelings. Their relationship appears increasingly sexualized, but nothing explicit has been said or done. As each person's perceptions become clouded by his or her own desires and fears, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the meaning of the other's behavior. In Gattrell's study 11% of residents believed that one or more patients were aware of their attraction. Boundary violations occur as the sexual dimension of a clinician-patient relationship becomes more explicit, understood and acted upon. Gutheil and Gabbard suggest that sexual misconduct, the most serious form of boundary violation, begins with relatively minor boundary crossings that \". . . show a crescendo pattern of increasing intrusion into the patient's space that culminates in sexual contact. A direct shift from talking to intercourse is quite rare.\" Peterson suggests that, \"In every story of a (boundary) violation . . . four motifs surface: 1) a reversal of roles (the patient takes care of the doctor), 2) a secret (shared intimate feelings), 3) a double bind (it is impossible to stay in or get out of the relationship), and 4) an indulgence in professional privilege (the doctor prevails upon the patient to meet a personal need).\" Gattrell found that 1% of residents acknowledged sexual contact with patients (all, in retrospect, regretted it). A parallel finding from this study was that 4% of men and 6% of women acknowledged sexual contact with their educatorsclinical supervisors, course instructors, advisors and administrators, suggesting a possible parallel process of boundary violations in professional training activities that is transferred into practice. (Module 41 is about Boundary issues.) |Identifying and managing \"seductive\" behavior| | | Seductive behaviors are verbal or nonverbal cues that are perceived as inviting a sexual dimension into the relationship. They may be intentional or unconscious; they are socially and contextually determined; they are inappropriate and invariably confusing in medical practice settings. Some people are \"exhibitionist\", and may be overly made up or over dressed, or dressed so as to reveal more of their body than needed for their work or for a physical examination. Others are more overtly seductive and act coyly or are flirtatious, employing facial expressions, movement, gait, gestures, and verbal innuendo that is (are) invitations to sexual activity, while an occasional person will make openly erotic invitations to sexual activity. |Some reasons people exhibit seductive behavior| | | Many people display seductive behaviors. Some have psychiatric illness, some confuse intimacy with sexuality, and much more commonly, people unconsciously reenact and project feelings about someone who is not in the room. Patients may unconsciously carry feelings and behaviors about significant people from their past into their current medical relationships Without any conscious awareness of what is happening, such individuals reenact their feelings and behaviors as if the clinician were the significant other person. This is called transference. Clinicians also may unconsciously reenact feelings and behaviors carried over from significant past relationships, and with no conscious awareness invite a sexual dimension into the relationship. This is called counter-transference. Physician counter-transference is likely to show up or be exaggerated during periods of feeling isolated, depressed, chronically stressed or fatigued. Some people learn that intimacy in any form is an invitation to sexual intimacy, or have never experienced intimacy except for sexual intimacy. For them, any opening to share important experiences and feelings becomes defined in sexual terms, and experienced as an invitation to sexual activity. At times patients' response to successful treatment is expressed in this way. People with certain psychiatric disorders, such as somatization disorder, borderline or histrionic personality disorders, schizophrenia, and persons who have been abused sexually, physically, or emotionally (PTSD), may have symptoms that include a component of seductive behavior. |Example Video| |Check out the video example on the left and consider the questions below.| Questions: | | How effectively did the physician in this video respond to this patient? How would you respond? |Responding to seductive behavior| | | Become more self-aware of your feelings and behaviors. Respond directly to seductive behavior. Talk with colleagues. Sexual feelings and unconscious counter-transference are normal for all clinicians. As a matter of both professionalism and better communication, we owe it to ourselves and our patients to become aware of our sexual feelings and associated behaviors. As lifelong learners we should continue to expand awareness about how they affect our relationships. In the video example above, the clinician could have immediately expressed concern about the inappropriate past relationship with the volleyball coach, and asked about it. He could have asked about a past history of physical or sexual abuse, depression, or low self-esteem, which may precede maladaptive sexual behaviors. By focusing on the patient and understanding the origins of a patient's behaviors, you keep the conversation in the clinical realm, on the goal of understanding the patient's perspective, and on helping the patient. After examining and eliminating your own motives and feelings, noticing that a patient is flirtatious can serve as a clue to identify potentially serious psychopathology. On the other hand, responding positively to a flirtatious patient may be a warning that there are unresolved relationship issues in your own life that you need to address. In interviews with patients, you can begin to respond effectively to seductive behavior by addressing it, and setting limits. For example, it is common for male patients to flirt with young women clinicians. Sometimes these patients are elderly or seriously ill, and the clinician interprets the comments as a defense against illness, and is not offended. Sometimes a patient will make an exploratory flirtatious comment. If you respond with a non-verbal message of disapproval, or ignore the comment, and continue with the clinical interview, the patient will often get the message. But if the inappropriate comments continue, it is best to address them directly: \"Perhaps you don't mean to offend me, but I find your comments offensive. Comments like this will get in the way of my giving you appropriate medical care.\" If comments still persist, it is often best to leave the room and bring back a more senior clinician. If situations seem to arise frequently, it can be helpful to reflect on your own behavior, and discuss this in a safe setting with trusted colleagues and mentors. L.J. Pitkow, at the time of taping a fourth year student at Drexel College of Medicine, demonstrates responding to seductive patient comments in the videos below: | | How to get over a flirt? | | What to do if patient persists? | | What if attracted to the patient? Example Videos: Please click the picture buttons to play back the videos Sometimes difficult situations can arise out of the best intentions if the clinician has not reflected honestly on the presence of covert sexual feelings in both clinician and patient. One attending physician shared this story: \"A second year resident told me about a patient he was caring for. She was a young woman who had been very overweight and who had gained most of her weight in the last two years as her marital relationship became more problematic. The resident talked about how he really liked this young woman, had spent a lot of time in counseling her and she had lost 40 pounds. He added, 'she really looks great now!' \"I told him I thought he was in potential trouble, but he denied there was any problem. The next day the resident called me in a panic. 'Can you come down to the clinic? She kissed me!' I asked, 'What did you do?' He said, 'I kissed her backI didn't want her to feel rejected!' I said, 'I'll be right down.'\" \"I spent time with them together, and talked with the patient about what had happened. She acknowledged she was falling in love with her physician as a way to avoid dealing with her relationship issues. She agreed to go for counseling. And the resident learned a valuable lesson about boundaries, and paying attention to his feelings in patient care.\" We would add that the advice to seek counseling applies equally to the resident. It is one thing to cross a boundary of sexual feelings for a patient and quite another to change one's behavior and self awareness to guard against such things happening in the future. Professional counseling may be the best route to ensure success in this situation. |SUMMARY| | | Interviewing about sexual matters is an important and routine part of medical encounters and avoiding this topic risks limiting patients' healthy sexual functioning, illness and death from HIV and other STD's, boundary violations and clinicians' well-being. We stress that failing to learn skillful and relationship-centered interviewing about sexual issues can produce the following negative consequences for patient care: Avoidance of patients or not performing services Inability to manage advances or attractions from patients Increased risk of boundary confusion or violation Erosion of professional satisfaction and well-being |BEHAVIOR CHECK LIST| |LITERATURE REFERENCES| |Welcome to Exploring Religious Beliefs |by Shimon Waldfogel, MD | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Author: | | RELIGION AND SPIRITUALITY| | | Religion and medicine have a common tradition of alleviating suffering; yet in modern times the religious /spiritual dimension of the person is little addressed in clinical training. Nearly three-quarters of Americans say that their approach to life is grounded in their religious beliefs. In clinical encounters, ignoring patients' religious beliefs limits your ability to attend to their needs. For millennia and across cultures and regions, religion and spirituality have had a special influence on people during times of personal crisis and suffering. It therefore seems likely to have an impact on health and response to disease. Just such an association has been demonstrated in numerous studies that have been reported in the medical, nursing, medical sociology and epidemiology literature. The inclusion of religious and spiritual problems in DSM IV further supports the importance of addressing this aspect of the person in the clinical setting. In this module we explore the role that religion and spirituality play in medical settings. The United States is a highly religious nation with 94% of Americans professing a belief in God, 57% report praying daily, 42% attending religious services regularly. Nearly three-quarters of Americans say that their approach to life is grounded in their religious beliefs.( [3](9_0.htm#3)) 82% of adults surveyed recently believe in the healing power of personal prayer and 77% believe that God sometimes intervenes to cure people who have a serious illness. Twenty-eight percent of the sample of 1004 adults believed in the ability of faith healers to make people well through their faith or personal touch. ( [4](9_0.htm#4)) Religion may have specific influence on dietary habits, cigarette smoking, sexual behaviour, drugs, and alcohol. Oleckno and Blacconiere ( [6](9_0.htm#6)) studied 1077 college students and found that religiosity was positively correlated with wellness and inversely with health compromising behaviours. Watson ( [7](9_0.htm#7)) studied the mortality rates from heart disease in 24 industrial countries. The mortality rate was inversely related to the proportion of Catholics to Protestants, and Watson speculates that the rate relates to the culture's attitude to time, i.e. \"waste of time is... the first and in principle the deadliest of sins.\" Comstock and Partridge ( [8](9_0.htm#8)) studied health related variables of 91,000 people in Washington County, Maryland, and found a decreased risk for Ischemic Heart Disease (IHD) death, liver cirrhosis, emphysema, and suicide in people who regularly attended church. Others have noted the benefit of religion in the prevention of depression and as a coping strategy among the elderly. ( [5](9_0.htm#5)) We include this module to help you explore these issues and develop your ability to explore and accept patients' perspectives and decisions. |DIALOGUES ABOUT RELIGIOUS AND SPIRITUAL ISSUES| | | Recent times have seen a growing recognition that the biopsychosocial model of health could expand to include the spiritual dimension.( Attending to the spiritual dimension provides clinicians with a deeper understanding of patients and their needs. Religious beliefs impact on patients' health and response to disease, and exert a special influence during times of personal crisis and suffering. Physicians' own religious or spiritual practices may impact upon their ability to function effectively in clinical practice The nature and depth of conversations about religious and spiritual issues in your medical interviews will depend on multiple variables. These may include the circumstances of clinical encounters, the time available, your role in the care of patients, and patients' views and responses and your comfort with these topics. When you speak with patients about advance directives, or engage them in the face of life threatening illness, you will explore religion and spirituality in greater depth than during visits for minor medical problems. |IMPLEMENTATION OF CONVERSATIONS| | | We offer specific suggestions for attending to spiritual dimensions of communication, skills that can facilitate patients' coping ability and enhance their well being. In order to implement your intention to skilfully explore patients' beliefs and offer help with their suffering, you will need at least four skill sets. The framework presented in the prior sections establishes the rationale for use of the skills discussed in this section. The skills you employ parallel those discussed in the \"Essential Elements\" modules, with specific modifications related to the content area of religion and spirituality. The skill sets are as follows: |Non-judgmental exploration| | | Physicians' own religious (or anti-religious) beliefs can distort their perceptions of patients' experience, as well as their interviews and relationships with patients. You need to develop your ability to explore and accept religious beliefs in a non-judgmental manner, whether your own beliefs are contrary to your patients' beliefs or not. In parallel with inquiry about your patients' family and social support systems, you can ask simple questions about patients' general views on religious and spiritual issues, and whether religion and/ or spirituality plays an important role in their life. The discussion of 'Advance Directives' (see doc.com module 32) can also be a useful context in which to address spiritual issues. | | \"How important is religion to you?\" \"What role does spirituality play in your life?\" See Example Video on the next screen. |Specific inquiry at times of suffering| | | Start by asking the patient to describe their experience of the illness in general terms before moving on to ask how this experience links up with their religious beliefs, how they interpret their suffering, and what role prayer or other practices plays in their efforts to cope. Clinicians' own emotional response to severe suffering, especially in life threatening conditions, and our anxiety not to seem intrusive or insensitive, may make it difficult for us to ask patients specific questions about their suffering and their religious response to it. Practicing some potential inquiries and talking over situations with team members and colleagues can enable you to bring patients into conversation about these issues, which is not only supportive for its own sake, but can also reveal possible new forms of support. That asking specific questions of a patient who is suffering a life threatening condition might have the effect of imposing an extra burden (which is the last thing a caring physician would wish to do) should not deter you. However, such questions need to be accompanied by good relationship skills (see 'Demonstration of Understanding and Respect' below); timing and pacing are most important and remembering to pause for reflective silences is an invaluable aid to considerate dialogue. If patients demur from the discussion, you can move on, and if they seem offended you can offer a compassionate apology and listen with empathy to their concerns. | | \"This is such a difficult and painful time for you. How are you doing at this moment?\" \"Can you tell me more about what it has been like?\" \"Would prayer or meditation be helpful for you in these times?\" |Demonstration of Understanding and Respect| | | Inviting patients to dialog about religion and spirituality at times of suffering is a complex process, and requires special attention to context, relationship and non-verbal signals. When you address sensitive issues, particularly in the context of life-threatening illness, showing your acceptance of patients' perspectives and your respect for them as persons is of special importance. Your demonstrations of understanding and respect need to be both clear and genuine, and you should attend carefully to assuring that your verbal expressions and your accompanying non-verbal gestures | | Check out the short video example The risk of seeming judgmental or insensitive or in other ways inappropriate is particularly great when it comes to making suggestions or offering help. You should only attempt such offers or suggestions when you have a good understanding of the religious and spiritual dimension of the patient's life, and only when you are confident that the patient feels understood and respected in that regard. |Suggesting / offering help| | | Many patients have the potential to receive help through religious and spiritual resources within their community. Through your inquiry, you can often help patients identify these resources, or remind them of their presence at times of confusion or loss. When and if you feel you understand patients, and they signal their trust in your relationship, you can make suggestions such as meditation or prayer or offer to enlist the help of an appropriate religious leader from the same faith background from whom the patient might get additional support. As an alternative, following exploration of religious and spiritual issues, you can invite patients to make their own suggestions about ways to access greater spiritual support. This is often more effective than suggestions from clinicians. Bear in mind that for some patients such an invitation can feel like a test or a burden. Attend to the skills of sharing information and reaching agreement in doc.com modules 10 and 11 for more discussion about developing options and seeking agreement on strategies that work in the best interest of the patient at this point in time. Examples of resources you might explore with patients include the following: outreach by religious institution to medically ill individuals; sponsorship of 12 step meetings; religious based counselling and prevention; early detection activities through the religious organization. Additionally, you may identify clergy in the community who can serve patients who need a cultural broker- someone who can put them in touch with culturally appropriate resources. | | \"Can your religious beliefs or your spiritual community provide you some support at this time?\" \"What do you know about resources that might helphave friends or neighbors mentioned help they received in times of stress?\" \"In addition to the medications, I would like to help you find sources of moral or religious or spiritual support-if that makes sense to you?\" \"Are you aware of counselling or support services available through your church?\" \"I know of a church with many people from (Vietnam)-perhaps the pastor there could put you in touch with .\" See next screen for an example video. |PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES| Before the modern scientific era, societies' healers were their priests or shamans. A crossover in the roles of physicians and spiritual leaders is still present in many cultures. Patients, especially when suffering is intense for them, have similar hopes when they see a physician or a spiritual leader- hopes for a miraculous cure, or at least relief form suffering. When you open the sensitive topics of religion and spirituality with your patients, you sometimes tap into this complex territory. If patients should ask you to pray with them, for example, your response is conditioned both by how fully you have explored the patients' beliefs and by your own religious and spiritual principles. If you believe in the efficacy of prayer (for example), and you have explored patients' belief in some depth (see \"demonstration of understanding,\" above) and can genuinely respond positively, do so. If you do not wish to do so, respectfully decline and offer referral. An unprofessional gesture that crosses personal and professional boundaries would be to spontaneously offer to pray with patients because that is how you personally might handle the suffering. Your engagement with patients should always be calibrated to match their needs to your sensibilities, and never to match your needs to their suffering, no matter how strong your personal commitment to a particular religion or spiritual practice. |SUMMARY| Exploration and discussion of religious and spiritual matters is an important therapeutic tool. Religious beliefs exert a special influence during times of personal crisis and suffering, and impact on patients' health and response to disease. Most Americans say that religion is important to them. Ignoring this dimension limits your ability to attend to your patients' needs. Clinicians who skilfully and empathically address this dimension can enhance patients' ability to cope with illness, and also arrange referrals and consultations that provide additional support when needed. In this module we provided a framework for initiating and conducting conversations about religion and spirituality in clinical encounters, and then present appropriate skills to implement conversations in a therapeutic manner. |BEHAVIOR SKILLS CHECKLIST| During an initial patient assessment At times when a patient is suffering from a serious illness |LITERATURE REFERENCES| |Welcome to doc.com Module 20: | The Family Interview |by Kathy Cole-Kelly, MD and Tom Campbell, MD | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Authors: | | |Learning goals:| |INTRODUCTION| | | Interviewing patients' families is an essential skill for all physicians. Families are the primary context within which most health problems and illnesses occur. Despite the changing demographics of the American families, most patients live with other family members and are strongly influenced by family relationships. The family remains the most basic relational unit and intimate social environment in our society. As such, the family has a major influence on the physical and mental health of its members (1). By understanding how the family influences health, the physician has the opportunity to anticipate and reduce the adverse effects of family stress and utilize the family as a resource in care of patients. A family-oriented approach to health care is based upon the biopsychosocial model that emphasizes the interrelationships between biological, interpersonal, and social factors in health (2). It recognizes that the family is the primary source of health beliefs, health-related behaviors, stress, and emotional support. |Research on Family Influences on Health| | | A large body of research has demonstrated that families have a powerful influence on physical health, including overall morbidity and mortality (1,3,4). Numerous epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that social support, particularly from the family, is associated with improved health (5). In a 1988 article in the journal Science, sociologist James House reviewed this research and concluded: The evidence regarding social relationships and health increasingly approximates the evidence in the 1964 Surgeon General's report that established cigarette smoking as a cause or risk factor for mortality and morbidity from a range of disease. The age-adjusted relative risk ratios are stronger than the relative risks for all cause mortality reported for cigarette smoking (6, pg 543). Family support affects the outcome of many chronic medical illnesses. Berkman and colleagues found that after suffering a myocardial infarction, women who are isolated and have few family or social supports experienced two to three times the mortality rate compared to other women (7). Many stresses within the family, such as loss of a spouse and divorce, significantly impact morbidity and mortality. Marriage is the family relationship that has the strongest influence on physical health. Even after controlling for other factors, marital status affects overall mortality, mortality from specific illnesses (e.g. cancer and coronary disease) and morbidity (3,4). Married individuals are healthier than the widowed, who are in turn healthier than either divorced or never married individuals. Many large studies have shown that bereavement or death of a spouse increases mortality, especially for men (8). Separation and divorce is also associated with increased mortality. The quality of marital relationships can influence the outcome of chronic medical illnesses. Marital quality predicts survival from congestive heart-failure(9), while marital stress has been shown to worsen coronary artery disease in women. Women with early breast cancer who do not confide in their spouses have higher recurrence rates than those who do have a confiding relationship (10) . Greater satisfaction and lower levels of conflict with their love relationships were independently associated with decreased mortality in female African-American henmodialysis patients, of the same order of magnitude as medical risk factors (11). Unlike patient centered interviewing, there is little empirical research on specific aspects of family interviewing and its relationship to patient and family satisfaction or health outcomes. However, a number of studies have examined the effectiveness and utility of different aspects of family interviewing including family history taking, physicians' level of involvement with families, and family conferences or meetings (12). |THE SKILLS OF FAMILY INTERVIEWING| | | Basic interviewing skills covered in Modules 5-12 are the foundation of a family interview. There are additional strategies that promote an effective interaction with a family. The basic skills of a good medical interview that have been covered in doc.com are important basic skills to maintain in medical family interviewing. The additional skills necessary for medical family interviews are detailed below. These skills, if used routinely with family members, will build your confidence and willingness to include family members when it is desired or when family members request such an interview. Without these skills, clinicians might avoid talking with the family and this could have negative repercussions for the patient, the family and the clinician. Because families exert a tremendous influence on patient's health it is critical to include them in multiple situations with patients in outpatient and inpatient medicine. |1. Joining with the patient and the family.| |It is important at the outset of the interview to develop rapport and establish a positive relationship with each family member.| The skills for this component include: |2. Special considerations for Joining with the Patient and the Family| | | Special circumstances require you to alter your approach. Children: Even small children can be important resources in a family meeting. Children usually have antennae that are picking up most things going on in families. Including the children in the steps above are important. Additionally, if the child is the patient, keeping the child, closest to the physician, either in his/her own chair or in the lap of a parent is part of this skill. Elderly: The elderly patient, including demented patients, definitely needs to be seated closest to you. Again this reinforces that you respect that this patient is the focus, has a voice (if able to contribute) and you are able to maintain strong eye contact with the patient. Non-English speaking patients with English speaking family member or interpreter. The interpreter does not need to be in eye contact with the physician if the interpreter is a non-family member. Place the interpreter's chair behind you, while keeping the patient directly next to you and within eye contact. If the interpreter is a family member, the family member can again be seated on the other side of the patient, leaving the patient-clinician eye contact closest. When there is known family conflict. If it becomes apparent that there is serious family conflict, it is appropriate to separate the family members. If it is a matter of disagreements, see section 4, but if there is serious, intense family conflict, then it is recommended that the physician separate family members and deal with each member individually. When there is suspicion of abuse. If there is suspicion of abuse, the clinician needs to be able to interview the patient separately. See module 28. |3. Setting the agenda and goals| | | After initial relationship building, you need to identify your sense of the goals for the family interview and the agenda. Discussing goals and setting the agenda establishes for the family what the course of the interview is to be and allows everyone to say if there are other issues that they would like to discuss. You can then negotiate with the family as to what is realistic to be addressed in this family interview. |4. Gathering information and managing the interview| | | Gathering information can be complicated with a number of family members present. Certain strategies will help you gather information efficiently while respecting and engaging all family members. |5. Handling family emotions| |The empathic skills presented in Module 6 will stand you in good stead. There are other strategies as well that can be useful.| |6. Establishing a plan and follow-up| | | A critical discussion toward the end of the interview focuses on establishing a plan and agreement of various family members to help. |RELEVANT BEHAVIORS| |LITERATURE REFERENCES| |Welcome to doc.com with Children and Parents\" |by Elizabeth A. MSW, MD, FAAP | \u00a9 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | Elizabeth Pediatric interactions are complicated, routinely involve the doctorparentchild triad and other family members, and are influenced by the cognitive and developmental stage of the child and changing family roles. The pediatric encounter encompasses not only medical problems, but also psychosocial and developmental issues. \"When I cough my brain shakes.\" 3-year-old Ethan describing his headache \"No doctor! No doctor!\" 2-year-old Ryan, initially refusing to be examined (1) \"It sounds like she swallowed a whistle.\" Mother of 1-year-old infant Communicating with children and their families is complex, and differs in many ways from communicating with an adult who is capable of making heath care decisions. [http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/159/5/414](http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/extract/159/5/414) |The DoctorParentChild Relationship| | | The child's communication role deserves special attention. Studies show that direct communication between physician and child contributes to improved relationship, satisfaction with care, treatment adherence, and better health outcomes.(3,4) \"I'm so scared, my eyes are making tears.\" 4-year-old Jonathan, worried about getting shots. Health professionals formerly relied on parents for information about their child's health. Children understand more about concepts of health and illness than previously thought, can provide unique and valuable information about themselves, and, when able, should be involved in decisions about their own health care.(5,6) | | Check out the video example: Different communication needs of parent and child pose an important challenge to relationship-centered care in pediatrics. Even when physicians support facilitation of child participation, parents may promote a passive child role that leads to sub-optimal treatment. Physicians can be explicit about partnering with parents and teach them the rationale for the child's active participation. At the same time, physicians need to address parents' needs and call on parents' expertise and knowledge of their child. Physicians can collaborate with parents to help children have a voice in medical encounters. After all, both parents and physicians want the best for the child. |Strategies that engage the child's participation| | | Engaging the child directly and conducting meaningful conversations with the child activate the child's effective participation. \"Emma, why have you come to see me today?\" | | Check out the video example that role-models taking the history from a 2 year old child. Alex, has anything else been bothering you? How about your ears? Kelly, how long have you had a runny nose? Alice, can you put your finger right where it hurts? 4-year-old Jonathan: \"I'm so scared, my eyes Physician: \"I understand. It's okay to be scared and to cry. Lots of kids are scared of shots and don't like shots. All kids who are 4 years old have to have 2 shots. The shots help keep you well. Jonathan's mother: \"Remember when Molly [Jonathan's friend] got her Jonathan: \"I don't want a shot!\" Physician: \"I know you don't want a shot. We'll do it very quickly and then you can pick out a sticker. You can sit in your Mom's lap.\" Physician: \"Do you have a dog?\" how dogs pant when they're hot?\" \"Okay, your job is to pant like a dog. Let's practice. I'll tell you when.\" While you give the shot, it sometimes helps to distract the child \"Pant like a dog!\" \"We're done! Would you like to pick out a sticker?\" |Skills and Strategies that Contribute to Parent and Child Satisfaction Enhancing satisfaction| | | Parents highly value physicians who attend to both their and their child's feelings and concerns (8) who seek to understand their perspective, and who utilize better communication skills. Physician attitudes of curiosity, humility, respect and reflective practice (14) are likely mediators of parent satisfaction. Parents who believe their child's physician is friendly, understands their concerns, and has better communication skills, are more satisfied.(9,10) Greater parent satisfaction is positively associated with: In the setting of a life-limiting condition of their child, Davies (12) found that sensitive pediatricians demonstrated the ability to understand the parents' perspective, were humanistic, had good technical skills, and sought to understand the parents' life world. | | Check out the video example where the history taking with the mother of a 5 month old child is demonstrated. Parents who changed pediatricians because of dissatisfaction perceived the pediatrician to be poorer at communicating effectively.(13) Browning (14) notes that self-awareness and reflective practice are central to physicians' compassionate communication with children and their families. He recommends that pediatricians develop a capacity for reflection, and come to value curiosity, humility, and respect for parents' expertise that will help them better understand the child and family. The child's experiences with health care may form a life-long attitude toward physicians and the health care system overall. Pediatricians have the opportunity to improve children's health behaviors. |Developmental Stages of Children Child development| | | Communication with children (and parents) improves if physicians understand and respect the differences reflected in the stages of child development. \"Why do we have necks to keep our heads up?\" - Jonathan, age 4 \"Do teeth bleed?\" Anna, age 5 \"Does your heart go on vacation?\" Carlos, age 7 (15) Children constantly change and their perspective varies by developmental stage, including aspects related to their cognitive, social, and emotional development. (16,17) The physician affirms and supports good parenting, and acknowledges and teaches about developmental milestones and child development. The table below presents information about children's cognitive development and their concepts of illness at different developmental stages. Table 1. Children's cognitive development and concepts of illness at different ages. | | | | Preschool children (3 5 years) | | School-aged children (6 12 years) | | Adolescents (>= 13 years) | | Cognitive development | | Magical thinking; circular reasoning Sees 1 or 2 aspects at a time; may ignore the whole of the situation Doesn't differentiate well between self and outside world; lives in the immediate environment | | Emergence of clear differentiation between self and others Begins to think relationally and to generalize Begins to integrate variables in causal relationships, and to reverse these relationships | | Capable of cognitive problem solving and decision-making Ability to think abstractly and hypothetically Uses generalization to fill in gaps in knowledge | | Child's | | Doesn't spontaneously conceptualize the internal parts of the body Illness results from wrongdoing; medical procedures are seen as a punishment Illness is caused by external concrete phenomenon: contagion, magic, \"from the sun\", \"from outside\" | | Can distinguish what is internal and external to self Cause of illness is a person, object, or action external to the child: \"you get a cold from not wearing a hat\"; \"you breathe too much air in your nose.\" | | Integrates multiple factors in understanding illness; imagines alternative possibilities Cause of illness lies in internal physiologic organ or process; may have additional psychological cause Understands illness as internal systems that dysfunction and cause external symptoms: \" a virus gets into the bloodstream and causes a cold.\" |Approaches to Children at Different Stages| | | Different developmental stages bring about different needs for both the child and family members, and require varied interviewing, examination, and counseling approaches.(18) Table 2. Approaches to the pediatric interview with children at different developmental stages |Infants | (0 15 months) |Toddlers (15 months 2 years)||Preschool children (3 5 years)||School-aged children (6 12 years)||Adolescents | (>= 13 years) |Location of child during interview|| Parent's lap or arms | Exam table | Parent's lap or arms | Freely moving about room | Freely moving about room | Exam table | Exam table | Chair | Exam table | Chair |Relationship building strategies|| Talk with child | Touch child Make sounds Play | Talk with child | Share books, toys Play | Talk with child | Share books, toys Play | Talk with child | Share books, toys; Play | Talk with adolescent| |Play strategies|| Respond to sounds; smile | Play \"peek-a boo\"; \"pat-a-cake\"; hiding games; Name objects as you give them to baby |Pretend-play; guessing games; tell stories; hide and find things.|| clubs, groups| |Can obtain some history from child||No||No||Yes||Yes||Yes| |COMMUNICATION SKILLS IN THE PEDIATRIC ENCOUNTER| | | The quality of the relationship with the child and family affects all aspects of patient care the diagnostic process, treatment decisions, adherence with treatment, and patient and physician satisfaction. Despite the extraordinary scientific and technological advances in modern medicine, the core skills and sine qua non for the delivery of quality health care remain those of maintaining good relationships and skillfully communicating. |Create and sustain a relationship with the patient and family| | | A therapeutic and communicative relationship with the patient is the cornerstone of competent medical care. Building and sustaining relationships with children and their family members remains an ongoing task within all encounters. | | Check out the video example about the examination of an 8 day old child. Components that underlie an effective physician-parent-child relationship include: attention to the child as a person, attention to the child's and family's values, motivation, and thoughts, and attention to the way each family member experiences the child's illness. Other important building blocks of effective relationship that will be explored in subsequent sections include respect, positive regard, empathy, listening skills, nonverbal communication, and understanding the role of play with children. The relationship is, after all, a shared experience. |Frameworks for describing skills and competencies| | | Use specific relationship-centered skills or competencies to create therapeutic relationships with patients and families. These include: being \"present\" and listening attentively, opening the interview; learning about the patient as a person; empathy and compassion; non-verbal activity; and play with children. Clinicians who reflect on their own thoughts and feelings, and are mindful of what they bring to the encounter, enhance the effectiveness of their skills. Several useful frameworks and descriptions of interpersonal and communication skills and relationship-centered care exist. Three useful models include: LINK 1: The Kalamazoo Consensus Statement \"essential\" competencies were developed by a group of North American experts in physician-patient communication including doc.com authors: Tom Campbell, Kathy Cole-Kelly, Michael Goldstein, Geoff Gordon, Dennis Novack, Elizabeth Rider, and Robert Smith. The competencies include: building the patientdoctor relationship; opening the discussion; gathering information; understanding the patient's perspective; sharing information; reaching agreement on problems and plans; and providing closure. These competencies are presented in Modules 06 12 of doc.com.

Rapport requires mutual interest and respect between the physician, child and parent. In pediatrics, a variety of individuals may accompany the patient e.g., siblings, one or both parents, grandparents, other relatives, guardian, or the nanny. To establish a positive context for the interview, open the interview with an inclusive introduction and greeting, acknowledge everyone in the room, use their names, and find out how they are related to the patient. Greet and welcome the child. Even with infants, the physician can smile and interact with the infant for several seconds. This also gives the physician a moment to assess the patient. Physician to infant: \"Look at you! You're getting so big.\" Physician to preschooler: \"Hi! How are you today?\" Welcome the child, even if initially resistant, as we see with 2-year-old Ryan \"No doctor! No doctor!\" exclaims my next patient, his small hands pressed tightly over his ears, a determined scowl on his face. Ryan is 2 years old. I smile at him and say \"Hi.\" \"No doctor!\" he replies. After talking with his mother and letting him get used to me, I approach him slowly. . . . \" [p. 414] (1) Address and acknowledge siblings in the room. Siblings can be disruptive if they feel displaced by a new baby or another sibling, so your early invitation to engage can have an important calming effect on the entire encountersiblings may behave better for the rest of the interview (though this isn't always the case). Your invitation and leadership also engages and assists the parents. Physician to sibling: \"Did you bring your baby brother today? Does he cry and make lots of noise?\" \"Sometimes babies do funny things!\" |Learn about the patient and family| | | Getting to know the patient and parent as individuals creates a connection that will increase their willingness to work with you on both simple and complex issues. It develops a context within which to understand your patient's problems, and improves your ability to successfully manage the child's care. Effective communication requires an understanding of the patient in her/his world. Make a social, non-medical comment to put the patient at ease at the beginning of the visit: | | Check out the video example about the examination of a 9 month old child - with the whole family there and included... Physician to preschooler: \"Did you just have a birthday? How old are you? What did you have on your birthday cake?\" (Questions about birthdays are particularly effective with preschoolers.) \"What's your favorite thing at preschool, not counting lunch or recess?\" \"Who lives in your house?\" Physician to school aged child: \"What grade are you in now?\" \"I see you've brought a book with you. What are you reading?\" \"Do you play sports?\" Find out who are the significant people in the patient's life? To child: \"Who lives in your house?\" of you?\" \"Tell me about your friends.\" \"Who can you talk to if you're worried about something?\" To parent: \"Does anyone help you out at home?\" What is important to the patient? To child: \"Do you have any questions?\" \"What do you like to do with your friends?\" \"What things make you happy? sad? mad?\" \"Is there anything you are worried about?\" \"What are some things you are good at?\" To parent: \"Do you have any questions or concerns for today?\" \"Any changes at home or in your life since we last met?\" \"Does Maria talk with you about what's going on at school?\" What contributes to the patient's and family's health and well-being? To child: \"What do you like to do with your mom? your dad? your sister or brother?\" To parent: \"What sorts of things do you do together as a family?\" \"What are your child care arrangements? How are they working?\" \"Do you get time for yourself?\" Sick children affect the entire family. If a child has been up all night crying from an earache, the parents are likely to be exhausted and worried. Physician to parent: \"You must have been up all night too.\" \"I imagine you are tired.\" Note: Many risks to children's health and development are preventable, and comprehensive health promotion and prevention are major aspects of pediatric practice. The Bright Futures national health promotion initiative provides a practical, developmental approach for primary health care for children and adolescents. Bright Futures materials cover many topics including: health supervision guidelines; recommendations on routine heath screening, anticipatory guidance and immunizations; and tools to help families and clinicians support healthy social and emotional development, monitor psychosocial development, and to identify early behavioral and emotional problems. Questions to address with families are provided. For more information, access the Bright Futures website. URL: [http://www.brightfutures.org/](http://www.brightfutures.org/). |Empathy and compassion| | | Physicians should show empathy and compassion in every encounter with patients.(22) The ability to convey empathy is an innate human quality, expressed in nurturing of children, family, friends, ill persons, and so on. The ability may be stifled or hidden by the demands of learning the science of medicine and other procedural skills of doctoring. Rekindling the ability or fostering it in a professional environment requires specific intention to do so. The effort can be aided by learning a set of skills(23). The ability to convey empathy in infinitely diverse and complex medical interview situations requires a mindful approach to encounters, listening to feedback and continuing practice. (Modules 2, 6,13) \"Empathy is the physician's ability to understand the patient's situation, perspective, and feelings and to communicate that understanding to the patient,\" (page 221)(24) such that the patient feels understood.(25) Empathy is different than sympathy. Sympathy occurs when the physician listens to the patient's story from the physician's point of view. Empathy occurs when the physician listens to the patient's story from the patient's point of view. | | Check out the video example about the examination of a 9 month old child - with the whole family there and included... Compassion is a powerful component of the physician-patient relationship. Compassion means 'with passion', with caring, with the need to ease the patient's suffering. It is consciousness of the patient's distress together with a desire to alleviate that distress. Compassion takes seriously the reality of other persons, their inner lives, emotions, experience of illness, and external circumstances. |Conveying Empathy and Compassion| | | Conveying empathy requires that the physician receives or perceives emotions and clues to emotions as a first step and, as a second step, responds to them in ways that the patient and family can perceive. Children express their emotions in varied ways. When they do not express them directly by, crying or having a temper tantrum, or by clinging, they may offer us clues. Much of empathic communication is subtle, and subject to cultural differences, particularly in its non-verbal elements. Because of this subtlety, empathy may be lost because physicians may be preoccupied with the cognitive work of organizing very complex data about diagnosis and treatment, while patients are preoccupied with confusion, worry, politeness or other social rules for medical encounters. The words we use with patients help us to pick up on the patient's clues and to elicit and respond to their emotions. What we say may promote empathic discussion, or miss it, or actually terminate it. Physicians can attend to connectedness and relationship, and remain empathic in spite of the obstacles by exercising basic empathic skills that include the following:(30) |Additional Strategies that facilitate conveying empathy (31)| | | Possessing a toolbox of strategies to promote empathic communication promotes your efficiency and enhances patient satisfaction. Questions: \"Can you tell me more?\" \"Is there anything else?\" has this been like for you?\" \"Were you scared?\" Reflections of the content and checking in about what the patient is saying: \"What I am hearing is . . . Do I have it right?\" \"I want to make sure I'm understanding what you are telling me.\" \"It sounds like you think . . .\" \"Did I leave anything out?\" \"Are you having a shot?\" Responses: \"That sounds really hard.\" \"It seems like that might feel . . .\" \"You must feel proud about that. That's great!\" \"You were really brave. Good for you!\" \"I can see that that is bothering you.\" \"It's okay to cry. No one likes to have a shot.\" |Use effective listening skills| | | Physicians demonstrate effective listening by reflecting, summarizing and checking whatever seems odd or unusual in the context, so that the patient appreciates the attempts to understand, and can correct or add information that completes the picture. \"I suspect that the most basic and powerful way to connect to another person is to listen. Just listen. Perhaps the most important thing we ever give each other is our attention. And especially if it's given from the heart.. . . . We connect through listening.\" (p. 143)(32) | | Check out the video example: as in any clinical interview you will see relationship building and other communication skill competencies carried out in conjunction with history taking and other interview tasks. The interviews, physical examinations and their scrolled list of skill labels selectively focus on communication / relationship skills rather than the complete medical interview or complete physical examination. Active listening skills enable the physician to hear and address the concerns of children and their families. Effective listening skills facilitate relationship20, and help patients understand that better care derives from collaboration between physician and patient. Listening inattentively or without mindfulness can lead to diagnostic and treatment decisions that are incorrect at best and dangerous at worst. Shortly after 9/11, I saw an Arab American father and his 5-year-old daughter in our office. She had a viral rash, and her father repeatedly asked if she had chicken pox, even after I explained why she did not. Listening to his persistent and anxious questions, and understanding them as a clue, I asked, \"Are you concerned about anything else?\" \"Does she have smallpox?\" the father asked. Only after he verbalized this underlying concern was I able to effectively provide reassurance, and he expressed his gratitude and relief. |Non-verbal communication| | | Mindful nonverbal communication helps develop an environment of trust, support, and comfort. \"Nonverbal\" includes body language as well as tone, pace and pitch of speaking. Nonverbal cues of inattention or distraction are more powerful than the words you say. Congruence between words, voice characteristics and body language is essential for effective communication. To focus the interview on the patient as well as the illness, and to show interest in the patient as a person, the physician must demonstrate, non-verbally, that what the patient has to say is important. Use non-verbal cues such as nodding, pausing, maintaining eye contact, and posture to show attentiveness and concern. (M14) | | Check out the video example: the interviews, physical examinations and their scrolled list of skill labels selectively focus on communication / relationship skills rather than the complete medical interview or complete physical examination. Strategies for nonverbal communication that promote connectedness and cooperation: Sometimes young children are frightened about being examined. I ask the parent to hold the child in their lap, and I sit at the child's eye level. When I listen to the child's lungs, for example, I slow my rate of speech and may whisper,\"Do you have Elmo back here? Or Big Bird? . . . \" A young child often calms to a gentle, quiet approach. |Children and play| | | Play is an integral component of healthy child development and learning. An effective strategy for communicating with young children is through the metaphor of play. Through play, children explore the world, gain understanding of themselves and others and communicate with peers and adults. As you observe young children play, you will see family-related themes, action plans for helping and healing, and for avoiding threats. Children use play to learn about the world and to explore their abilities to cope with its complexities. Children's play becomes increasingly more varied and complex as they grow. (click [here](1_40.htm) to see Table 2 on Developmental Stages of Children) When examining young children, creating a playful atmosphere helps the pediatrician complete necessary tasks and adds enjoyment for both the child and the physician. \"No doctor! No doctor!\" exclaims my next patient, his small hands pressed tightly over his ears, a determined scowl on his face. Ryan is 2 years old. I smile at him and say \"Hi.\" \"No doctor!\" he replies. . . . . (p. 414) (1) The interview proceeds playfully with the pediatrician asking: \"Where is your heart? Is it here?\" \"Do birthday cake in your tummy?\" \"Let's check!\" \"Do you have bunny rabbits in your ears?\" \"Which ear should we check first?\" The examination concludes: When he realizes our time is up, he lags, pulling on his mother's arm so he can remain in the examination room. \"More doctor! More doctor!\" he exclaims. (p. 414; for a description of the full examination see reference (1)) |Understand the child's and parent's perspective| | | Understanding the patient's perspective includes understanding the child's and family's individual concerns, beliefs, and expectations, and respecting their cultural and ethnic beliefs, practices, and language. (20) The child's perspective depends upon her or his developmental stage.(M9) \"When I cough my brain shakes.\" 3-year-old Ethan describing his headache \"It feels like bees are in there.\" 7-year-old Eliza describing her ear ache \"Are deer ticks carnivores?\" 4-year-old Michael with questions after being brought to the pediatrician for a tick bite | | Check out the video example: The 8 year old girl shows insight and concern. How does the child and family experience the child's illness? What are the child's ideas about their illness? Listen to the patient's or family's story, elicit their understanding of the causes of illness and possible treatments, and identify their major concerns. Ask about life events, circumstances, and other people that might affect health. Elicit expectations about illness and treatment. \"What do you think has caused the problem?\" \"What concerns you the most about your child's illness?\" Children reveal clues to their concerns and perspective through their questions and comments. \"Does your heart go on vacation?\" 7-year-old Carlos asked during his yearly checkup. After further discussion it becomes clear that Carlos is pondering the concept of death.(33) David, age 10, was hit in the leg with a baseball. During the visit, his mother expressed her concerns about his future fertility, and was reassured to learn that David was unharmed. Following a discussion of puberty, hormones, and the changes that occur as bodies grow, the following dialogue ensued between David and his pediatrician: As we wrap up the visit, I ask him, \"Do you have any more questions?\" \"No,\" he replies, \"I figured it out.\" \"What did you figure out?\" I ask. \"Girls attract hormones,\" he concludes. (p.792)(34) You can also ask the child and parent to articulate their emotions (e.g., \"You seem worried; is that right?\") and respond explicitly to their expressed ideas and feelings. After a three-year-old well-child visit, Sarah's mother shares that Sarah has seemed anxious and worried since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. We talk further. I kneel down to Sarah's eye level and tell her \"your mommy is safe, your daddy is safe, and you are safe\". She looks at me with big, attentive eyes and I know I have connected. With solemn seriousness, she slowly pulls her lollipop out of her mouth and says, with great emphasis, \"And my kitty cat.\" \"Yes, your kitty cat is safe too.\" (p. 531)(35) |Sharing information| | | Because physicians contend with life and death, the power and impact of words is magnified, and patients and worried parents can be easily frightened by careless word choices, especially about prognosis. Share diagnostic and treatment information gently and use words that are easy for the patient to understand. Intersperse the telling of information with asking about understanding and impact. Patients highly value these gestures of respect, dignity and consideration. | | Check out the video example where the physical exam on a 5 month old child is demonstrated. Physicians who understand a child's developmental and cognitive perspective and use this knowledge when sharing information, provide better communication, better relationship and better care. 3-year-old Victoria, her infant brother, and her parents came to the office several weeks after Victoria's 20-month-old brother, Sean, had died of a congenital disease. It was a busy weekend day with patients scheduled every 10 minutes. While I examined her infant brother, Victoria hid near the examination table and occasionally peeked out. Her parents and I talked about Sean's death and how they were coping. Victoria's mother commented that Victoria repeatedly asked, \"Where is Sean?\" and that she had become increasingly clingy and would not let her parents out of her sight. After further discussion about young children's view of death, and their cognitive inability to see it as permanent, I noted, \"I think two things are going on that are common reactions 3 year olds have when someone has died.\" \"Victoria may fear that, because Sean disappeared, either parent could do the same.\" I explained the need to repeatedly and concretely reassure Victoria that, even though Sean went away, her mother and father, and her baby brother were not going to go away, even when she was bigger. We also discussed the fact that 3 year olds have an egocentric view of the world and tend to think that things happen because of themfor example, Sean's death. \"You can reassure her that it's not her fault that Sean died, that it happened because he was very sick with a sickness she and her baby brother and her parents did not have and could never get.\" During this discussion, I also spoke directly to Victoria, modeling the conversation her parents could have with her. Victoria emerged from her hiding place, first moving behind her mother, then moving more freely around the examination room, and finally initiating conversation with me. |Partner with patient and family| | | The physician-patient relationship is a partnership. When working with children, create an atmosphere of mutuality and respect by inviting active patient and family collaboration throughout the encounter, with particular attention to involving them in decision-making. To partner with patients (19,20): Adopt a relationship-centered perspective. Effective communication between physician, child and family is always a two-way, reciprocal process that involves flexibility in interaction and relationship development between human beings, rather than simply the collection of facts and establishment of diagnosis and treatment. NOTE: Children's Emotional Health Link (CEHL) is designed to provide physician training in psychosocial pediatrics, to improve physician-patient communication and to help doctors and nurses become more skillful in assessing emotional problems in children. CEHL uses a \"strength-based\" rather than pathology-based approach. The website [http://www.cehl.org](http://www.cehl.org) contains thoughtful articles for parents, pediatricians, and other health professionals as they work together to improve the emotional health of children. |SUMMARY| | | Building and sustaining relationships with children and their family members is an ongoing task that includes a set of skills that can be improved with knowledge and practice. Communication between physician, child and family involves conversation and relationship between human beings rather than simply the exchange of facts. A therapeutic and communicative relationship with the patient and family is the cornerstone of competent pediatric care. Children are not small adults. They present their chief complaint in unique ways stating: \"I have bees in my ears.\" \"When I cough, my brain shakes.\" And they ask questions like: \"Do teeth bleed?\" \"Can you check my mom to see if she's going to have another baby?\" The pediatric interview is influenced by the cognitive and developmental state of the child and changing family roles. Children see the world differently at different developmental stages and ages. Younger children communicate through the metaphor of play. Your history and examination will be different with children of different ages. Working with parents and families is an important component of pediatric care. The pediatric interview routinely involves the doctorparentchild triad and other family members. The pediatric interview encompasses not only medical concerns; more and more children are seen for behavioral and developmental problems, especially in primary care. We can have meaningful conversations with children. Studies show that direct communication between physician and child contributes to improved relationships, satisfaction with care, and better health outcomes. |ALL VIDEOS| | | | | | | | | | | | | Please click any of the hyperlinks to start the respective video |RELEVANT BEHAVIORS| |LITERATURE REFERENCES| to doc.com Module 22: | Communicating with Adolescents |by Kenneth R.

Ginsburg MD, MS Ed View| |Because 80% of what kills adolescents and young adults today is preventable, physicians must dialog with adolescent patients about depression, drug-use, violence, and sexuality.| Take even a perfunctory glimpse at morbidity and mortality statistics, and you will understand that if we are to save adolescent lives and preserve their health, we must do more than just evaluate their presenting complaints. While 80% of what kills adolescents aged 14-24 is preventable, few adolescents visit physicians' offices with the intention of discussing these issues. Addressing sensitive topics with a teen is a daunting task. Communicating with youth may seem awkward and difficult; obtaining their adherence to healthcare regimens can at times be challenging, and time constraints may dissuade or excuse physicians from even asking about important subjects such as depression, suicide, and sexuality. As healthcare professionals who care for adolescents, our role is unique in their lives: we are often the sole (non-parental) adults who see them repeatedly and confidentially throughout their development. By communicating effectively, we can have an enormous impact during these formative and sometimes dangerous years. |Focus interviews using the SSHADESS screen| | | Emphasize the social history, connect stress and behavior, and engage teens as developing young adults for whom an important goal is to be in control of their lives. The traditional medical interview teaches us to obtain a medical history, identify \"harmful\" behaviors, explain how these actions/choices will negatively impact teens' lives and advise cessation. This approach to patient communication tends to be ill suited to adolescents. First, instead of a chief complaint, the focus of the adolescent interview is usually the social history, which encompasses questions about self-described Strengths, School, Home, Activities, Drugs, Emotions (depression/suicidality), Sexuality and Safety (the SSHADESS screen). Many teens are uncomfortable discussing this information using the standard question and answer format. Additionally, medical interviewers usually assume a shared sense of purpose for these very private questions, and fail to elicit honest answers from teens who do not understand the purpose. Furthermore, even when there is a chief complaint (e.g. fatigue, abdominal pain) it may be the body's reaction to stressors that need to be explored using the SSHADESS screening. Few adolescents possess enough insight to make this connection. Lastly, because adolescents are experimenting with issues of autonomy and independence, they respond poorly to \"lecture\" format. Teens often believe that they should make the decisions that affect their lives. Listing a series of \"negative\" behaviors and advising cessation fails to enlist their involvement and positions a provider as adversary rather than advocate, jeopardizing the opportunity to help mediate positive change. |Adopt a focus on youth's strengths| | | Approach teens appreciatively and focus on their strengths. Physicians have a unique opportunity to assist teens, and this unit outlines ways to facilitate safe, open and honest communication and discuss risk-reduction using a positive, strength-based paradigm. As medical professionals who care for adolescents, we have the opportunity to advocate for youth, to guide their development and to help them learn to be active participants in their health care. To help adolescents develop positive characteristics such as confidence and a sense of competency, approach them appreciatively. Instead of focusing on their \"negative\" behaviors, listen to what makes these young people special and to what they are doing right. Move beyond telling them what not to do and reinforce the good things they are already doing. Our goals with every encounter should be to make teens feel safe enough to discuss problems honestly, to recognize teens' positive characteristics, and to guide them to build new capabilities based on their pre-existing strengths. In this module, we discuss concrete approaches to facilitating honest and safe communication with teens. We break down the adolescent visit into three phases, Setting the Stage, Obtaining the Medical and Social History, and Addressing Risk-behavior and provide sample conversations as well as strategies for coordinating the entire visit. We emphasize using a strength-based approach to addressing risk-behavior with teens and highlight dialog techniques for achieving this goal. Lastly, we discuss the connection between stress, risk-behavior and somatic complaints, and provide brief interventions on each of these topics. |CREATE A ZONE OF SAFETY WITH ADOLESCENT PATIENTS: SETTING THE STAGE| | | Setting the Stage facilitates honest and safe communication with teens, takes only 3-4 minutes, and paves the way for briefer encounters later, as well as future additional clarifications if necessary. Explain to teens why you will ask personal questions, what you will do with the information, and how they benefit from choosing to share with you. Teens are more likely to share personal information with a provider who helps them understand why the information is important to health (1). Building a trusting relationship with the teen by properly \"Setting the stage\" is the most critical part of the initial visit. An effective dialog addresses teens' concerns, provides them with resources in case of crisis, and allows teens to evaluate physicians' style, particularly with respect to not making judgments and showing respect. Substantial research underscores the importance of provider interpersonal style with adolescent patients (2-6). Our studies indicate that young people respond to and seek providers who are honest, respectful, and caring (7, 8) and who are non-judgmental, consistent, and professional (9). Despite the best interpersonal skills, however, clinicians who do not also provide teens with a sense of purpose for the questions asked will not achieve open and honest communication. Time is a significant limitation in all patient encounters; but taking the time to \"set the stage\" at the initial visit, establishes the safety and relationship that make future interventions much briefer. |Setting the Stage: The need for personal questions| | | Physicians should strive to help their teen patients understand four critical points: the need for personal questions; choice; privacy; and the benefits of trust. First, help the teen understand why you will ask private questions. Teens rarely anticipate being asked personal questions, and most of your interview seeks to obtain a deeper level of communication. Consider beginning the encounter by saying, I'm a doctor; my job is to save lives and help my patients stay healthy. I worry about many things like sore throats and sprained ankles, but also about things like violence, drugs, stress, and depression. Do you agree that doctors should worry about all these things? If you were the doctor and I were your patient, and we could talk behind closed doors, what would you be worried about that could hurt me? This puts into context the issues you will address in this interview. |Setting the Stage: The importance of honesty| | | Honesty is important and the teen has a choice about responding Stress the importance of honesty and make it clear that the teen has a choice in discussing any issues that arise. You can ask me anything and I'll be honest. I'd like to talk with you about all those things I just mentioned, and I need for you to be honest with me. Just because I ask you a question, though, doesn't mean you have to answer it. I'd rather you say: \"I don't want to talk about that today\" than give me an answer that is not completely true. Remember, I don't read minds. If you tell me something that isn't truthful, I won't know. But I also won't be able to help you or answer your questions about a subject you may really want to talk about. |Setting the Stage: Privacy and confidentiality| | | Discuss privacy and confidentiality. Teens need to know what you will do with information they provide and also that they will not be punished or judged because of what they choose to discuss. Adolescents are seldom aware of laws that protect their right to privacy, and they believe that providers can discuss their information with parents and ancillary staff (1). Reassure patients that you will discuss them only with medical team members. Tell them about the limits of confidentiality that relate to suicidality, homocidality/violence, and abuse. Avoid terms such as \"secret\" which may denote shame or even the term \"confidentiality\" which may, to a teen, mean \"confidence.\" Be prepared to reassure adolescents who worry that you may report smoking, drugs, and sex because they assume that you think these will \"hurt,\" \"kill\" or \"harm\" them. Here is an example of what you can say about why the teen can trust you: Here's what is really important for you to know: I can't punish you and don't want to. I take care of lots of teens and really like them all- teens who do all sorts of things. I don't judge you on your behavior, instead I listen and respect your honesty and answer your questions so you can learn more about your body and your health. I know you are worried about who I may tell if you tell me something that is going on in your life. I keep your information private; I tell nobody without your permission; not even your parents. I do need to tell other members of the team, but only those directly responsible for your care. If your life were in danger because you are going to kill yourself or someone else or if someone else was abusing you, you and I would have to work together right away to get other people involved to keep you safe. |Discuss the benefits of trust| | | Explain to the teen that taking the risk to trust you will have benefits. Assure the teen that a substantial benefit of trusting you with personal information is your ability to truthfully and in an unbiased way answer difficult questions and provide help for complex situations and dilemmas. This final part of setting the stage helps minimize the risk always inherent in trusting another person. My job is to help my patients and I, along with the team I work with, know how to do this. I know it is hard to open up to someone you don't know well, but I want you to know that I am here to help you have a positive future and to be safe and healthy. |Include parents| | | Set the stage with parents, and acknowledge and balance their needs Parents often accompany adolescents, and setting the stage with them is also a critical part of the initial interview. Forming a good relationship with both teen and parent can make future interventions much easier to manage, especially in time of crisis. Plan to speak to the adolescent separately from the parent at some point, and also arrange to include the parent as much as possible. Having the parent in the room need not detract from forming a positive relationship with the teen. Help parents understand the four key elements with which you set the stage for teens, and also explain an additional fifth component; namely, that you will not exclude parents if their teen is in trouble. |Check out the video example about emphasizing the role of the parents.| When asked to leave the room, many parents will feel left out of discussing the issues about which they are most concerned (i.e. violence, safety, sex, and drugs). Coordinating and balancing private and joint time can be difficult, especially if there are conflicts between parent and teen. To the teen, reinforce your commitment to confidentiality and to providing a safe place where the teen can come for help, and to the parent, outline a team-oriented plan in case of crisis. Here are examples of what you can say to the parent and teen: Directly to the child: Now, my job is to help you, but if you were really in trouble, who could help you the most? Listen and learn from the child's response, then redirect if necessary, with the goal of having the teen mention their primary caregiver. Yes, I think that your mom/dad/caregiver can help you the most, too. Now, I meant what I said before: I promise your strict privacy, but don't be mad at me if I think you might be headed for trouble and I suggest we work together to figure out the best way to get your parent(s) involved. But don't worry I won't do it without your permission unless your life is in danger. Directly to the parent: If we do come to you, I'd like for us to work together as a team to keep your child safe. But I'd like us to agree now that if something comes up in our visits, your son/daughter would not be punished. Wonderful things can happen here if young people know this is a place they can come for help without fearing they will be punished. | | Oana Tomescu MD, PhD, is setting the stage in this movie |ELICIT THE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY| | | When obtaining the teen's medical and social history, consistently demonstrate that patients can trust you with personal and delicate information. After setting the stage, focus on obtaining information. Engage in a \"patient-centered\" interview style (see module 5) that demonstrates consistency between your words during setting the stage and your current actions of suspending judgment while attentively listening. This extends the zone of safety, no matter what particular format you utilize to gather complete information. |Check out the video example about anticipatory guidance about the medical history.| Youth, like many adults, often adopt a step-wise \"testing\" format when deciding whether to trust a physician: they divulge a bit of information and judge the adult's reaction. If the clinician is non-judgmental, keeps their confidence, and demonstrates a caring attitude (9), they reveal more, and do so in larger increments. Therefore, consistency in spoken words, body language, and eye contact demonstrates to the youth that it is safe to be open and honest. That is, effectively building the relationship results in better information gathering (see module 6). Start gathering information with medical questions, since medical questions are perceived as less intrusive, and allow you to demonstrate that you are a safe and trusting listener. If parents are in the room, include them incrementally by first asking patients about their medical history and then asking parents to contribute additional details. This strategy has multiple benefits: it provides teens with anticipatory guidance for future visits to doctors' offices when they may be alone; it gives parents an opportunity to teach their child; it allows the clinician to observe interactions between parent and child; and it strengthens the team-oriented approach to caring for teens. After having asked the teen questions about the presenting complaint, PMH, and family history, let the teen know you are going to involve the parent and that this is their opportunity to listen and learn. I'm going to ask your mom these questions too. I want you to listen to her answers because it is really important that you know your own and your family's medical history. Soon you are going to be going to doctors by yourself and you'll need to be able to provide this information. Ask directed, focused questions to the parent. After obtaining most of the medical history, guide the conversation towards the SSHADESS screen using the same strategy of involving first the teen, then the parent. |Move to SSHADESS topics after medical ones| | | An effective social history screen has a dual purpose: to learn about the teen's strengths and to explore his/her current risk-behaviors. Undertaking the SSHADESS screen accomplishes two goals, learning about teens' strengths and capabilities and exploring their risk-behavior and current coping strategies. Begin by asking the safer, less intrusive questions about strengths, school, friends, and activities, and involve parents in an incremental fashion, again. Then move to the more personal aspects of the social history, asking parents for any additional concerns and advising them that you'll ask them to leave the room for the physical exam. |Check out the video example about asking parents to leave the room.| You might weave elements of medical and SSHADESS paradigms into a more free-flowing format. Address parents' additional concerns in a way that is supportive of the teen's right to privacy. Once parents leave, reengage patients and ask about the more personal SSHADESS questions, carefully fostering an environment for non-judgmental, honest, and safe communication. A good transition question could be something like, \"X, I know all about your medical history now, but I also want to know more about you. Why don't you tell me about yourself? How would you describe yourself?\" The following SSHADESS questions are mere suggestions for each topic of the screen. Screens should be tailored for each patient and community and worrisome answers should prompt additional questions. The goal of the screen is two-fold: to learn about the teen's strengths and positive capabilities and to also explore risk-behavior in order to evaluate the teen's current coping strategies. Ask for parental feedback in incremental steps during the screen. \"Mrs. Jones, what do you love most about your son? How do you think things are going at school and at home? Do you have any concerns about these issues? The Emotions/Depression screen can be done with the parent in the room, but the clinician should also plan to readdress the issue in context of the answers given once alone with the patient. \"Steve,, are you generally happy; how is life going for you? Mrs. Jones, does Steve ever seem depressed to you?\" The more sensitive areas of the SSHADESS screen (i.e. Drugs, Sexuality, Safety) can be explored once the parent is out of the room. |Self-described Strengths| It is nice to begin the SSHADESS screen by giving the adolescent the opportunity to describe himself. Ask questions such as, How would you describe yourself? What is the best thing about yourself? What you are most proud of? Some teens will be at a loss, giving the interviewer a great deal of information about the patient's self-image. In this case, the interviewer can ask, How would your friends describe you? |School| School performance tells a lot about overall well-being. Ask, How is school going? What would you like to do when you get older? Worrisome responses are predictive of other problems. Youth with no plans may not believe they have a future, and consequently may put themselves at greater risk. |Home| Many teenagers have tense relationship with their parents, but it is critical to determine when the relationship is reaching crisis proportions. Questions like, How are things at home? Who lives at home? How are things going with your parents/siblings? are a good initial screen. If caught early, families can be guided into the use of more appropriate levels of communication and discipline. |Activities| Peer relationships are of exceptional importance to the teenager. Knowing what a patient's friends are doing offers a strong clue into what type of negative pressures the patient is likely to encounter. A youth with nothing to do is more likely to fill their time with negative behaviors. Ask questions such as, What are your friends like? What kinds of things do you do together? What do you do after school? |Drugs / Substance Use| Mind altering substances contribute sharply to the mortality related to injuries and violence, and to the morbidities of school failure and depression and to the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. Ask general questions first, then personal ones. Do lots of kids at school or near home drink or smoke? How about drugs? Do you know any people who use? What do you think about alcohol and drugs? Have you ever tried? |Emotions/ Depression| Not all adolescents who commit suicide are depressed; some are impulsive. Because depressed youth often do not exhibit classic vegetative signs, teenagers must be asked questions about depression and suicide directly. An initial screen involves the following questions: Are you generally happy; how is life going for you? When you have a bad day, what do you do? Do you have anyone to talk to? Do things ever get so bad that you've thought about killing yourself? If any response is worrisome, a comprehensive screen must be carried out and immediate referral to mental health services must be made. |Sexuality| It is extremely important to approach this subject with no preconceptions of level of sexual activity or of heterosexuality. Some teenagers resent adult assumptions that they have had sex. Additionally, many youth dealing with sexual orientation and sexual identity issues are in a state of turmoil and rarely have a responsible adult whom to approach during a time of crisis. The medical provider can be a tremendous source of support and guidance for this segment of the adolescent population. Open-ended and non-gender specific ways of obtaining a sexual history include: Have you begun dating? Are you currently seeing someone? What is the person like? Have you begun to become sexual with that person; I mean kissing or touching in private places? Have you had intercourse with this or any other person? |Safety| Interpersonal violence is a primary concern for many youth. Determining who is likely to be a victim or perpetrator of violence can save lives. Many youth believe that a weapon will protect them without even considering that it puts them at greater risk of death, thus it is imperative to learn whether the patient carries or has access to a weapon. Additionally, when treating a teen for a violence-related injury it is of critical importance to explore whether they have plans to get even. Start the discussion with general questions and proceed to personal ones. Do you feel safe at home/school? Are there a lot of fights and/or weapons at your school? How about at home? Do you get in fights? What makes you mad enough to fight? Have you ever been hurt in a fight? Do you have a gun or a knife? |Remain non-judgemental, and separate history from advising| | | To maximize safe and honest communication, examine your attitudes and do not begin counseling on risk-behavior until you complete the entire SSHADESS screen. Respect teens' autonomy. Often, clinicians' own subconscious makes connecting with adolescents a real challenge. Become aware of your own biases, expectations and emotions, so that you do not send mixed messages to teen patients. Many physicians cannot remain non-judgmental when teens discuss their risk-behaviors, and succumb to the urge to begin risk-behavior counseling just as the teen discloses key personal information. Withhold guidance and advice until completing the entire SSHADESS screen, and your interventions will not only be of maximal benefit but also more genuine and congruent. In particular, SSHADESS aids your understanding of what drives engagement in risk-behaviors in the first place, because teens tend to share their behaviors in context of the rest of their lives: \"I get into fights because \" \"When I am stressed out, I \" This affords you a more complete picture and additional clues for guiding conversation toward constructive paths. With a broader appreciation, you might fill in other gaps or just chat during the physical exam, and then transition to conversation about risk-behaviors and construction of a health plan. A transition technique that underscores your respect for the teen's autonomy is to acknowledge the behavior in the larger context of the patient's life and positive capabilities, and then ask permission to address it. Offering teens this choice shows respect and also empowers them to make the primary decision to address the issue. When the answer is \"yes,\" you can begin to construct a dialog that is guiding in nature. Rarely is the answer \"no\"; but when it is, respect this choice, ask patients to ponder the issue on their own, suggest that you might bring it up again at a future visit, and offer to dialog at any time. Ask the parent to leave the room using the physical exam as a transition Mrs. Jones, do you have any other concerns before I have you step out of the room so I can complete Steve's check-up? Make a plan to get the parent at the end of the visit. \"Ok then, why don't you wait in the waiting room and I will get you after I finish the check-up and we'll make a health plan for X together.\" Redirect with the adolescent and continue the SSHADDESS screen. \"X, I meant what I said before about keeping your information private. I know it can be hard to talk about some topics in front of a parent, though, and I just want to make sure that if you have questions or other things to say that we have a chance to talk about them alone. The physician should be ready with follow-up questions, since few teens will be ready to disclose information right away. \"For instance, one of the things I didn't want to ask in front of your mom in case it would make you uncomfortable was about --.\" |ADRESSING RISK-BEHAVIORS: ADOPT A STRENGTH-BASED PARADIGM (1)| | | Our goal as youth advocates is to empower and strengthen our patients, to boost their confidence and underscore their competence. To change maladaptive behavior, a person needs both confidence that the issue is important and an inner sense of competence to make change. If our goal as youth advocates is to empower and strengthen, then we must learn about teens' strengths and positive capabilities, and stop focusing on the teen's negative behaviors. When we listen to youth with our hearts as well as with our minds, we discover what we respect and admire about patients, even in context of the dangerous behaviors that we medical professionals know are unhealthy. Helping youth discover and acknowledge strengths is not only the first step to mediating positive change through emphasizing competence, but it is also one of the most rewarding moments in interactions with adolescent patients. Few teens receive unqualified positive feedback from an adult; few feel they have someone advocating for their needs. More sadly, few have encountered adults who could see past the risk-behaviors and try to understand why the teen is engaging in these dangerous coping strategies. When teens are guided to acknowledge their strengths, they tend to be more receptive to learning how to build on their existing capabilities in relation to changing worrisome behaviors. |Focus on strengths and concrete steps| | | Examine your expectations to avoid undermining your effectiveness. Facilitate a discussion that avoids lecturing. Give positive feedback, and help break down large abstract concepts into a series of small, concrete steps. We need to ask whether our heightened awareness of problems such as teen pregnancy, violence and drug use lead us to mistrust patients and to expect the worst from them. Are you defining success for youth in terms of behaviors they avoid rather than who they are? If you have low expectations of your patients, this undermines the effectiveness of your interventions just as low confidence on their part hampers progress. If you exclusively target risk and limit our focus to drug-, violence-, and pregnancy-prevention programs, you convey your low expectations of adolescents and send them the implicit message that you expect them to engage in these behaviors. |Check out the video example about transition to the final phase of the visit of addressing risk-behavior| After the physical exam, you should transition to the final phase of the visit of addressing risk-behavior Provide positive feedback: \"Julie, I have really enjoyed talking with you. I have learned a lot about you and I really appreciate how honest you have been in talking with me.\" Use a strength-based approach: state what is most admirable about the teen, address the risk-behavior, and then ask permission to talk about it. \"I really admire how much you care about and love your family and your boyfriend, (pause), but I am worried about you not using condoms every time you have sex. Can we talk about this more?\" During the conversation, guide teens to explore the immediate- and long-term consequences of their behavior and also the underlying motivations behind other people's actions. If you ask guiding questions, give positive feedback, and reflect back the teens' answers, you can coordinate a dialogue that breaks down abstract concepts into simple, concrete and understandable steps. This approach is most effective if you can help patients discover the key points themselves and reach conclusions on their own. By keeping the concepts simple and concrete and guiding teens to explore each step in sequence, you can lead the teen to the final abstract realization, the \"Cognitive Ah-Ha! Moment\" (11). In summary, the physicians' role in addressing risk-behavior is to identify teens' positive capabilities, help them acknowledge their strengths, and mobilize these strengths to examine worrisome behaviors and plan for changing them. If a teen declines to talk about the behaviors, offer future help whenever the teen may be ready. \"I respect that you don't want to talk about this now and I appreciate your honesty. If you ever do want to talk about this later, I'm always here to listen or answer any questions.\" |Guide gently, rehearse and write down options| | | Use communication techniques such as the choreographed conversation, role-playing, and the decision tree to involve the teen in brainstorming different approaches to the issues they currently face. The choreographed conversation is one of several techniques you might employ to help teens brainstorm different approaches to current issues and break down abstract concepts into manageable and understandable parts. This conversation is a loosely formatted dialog that uses questions to get the teen thinking about the problem from different angles. The physician conveys several points to the patient, and helps brainstorm other points by asking guiding questions in dialog, rather than delivering an entire message in one bolus (lecture-style). Following questions with empowering feedback assists patients to discern key concepts, to anticipate the consequences of the current behavior and to begin planning for change. Some sample choreographed questions: Julie, what are condoms for anyway? What do they do? Get the teen to list all the reasons; prompt if necessary. What do you mean infections? Which ones are you worried about? You know a lot about these things! Doctors worry about these infections, too. Tell me more about why YOU worry about infections. Yes, Chlamydia and Gonorrhea can hurt a lot, especially if they go up into your tubes and ovaries. And just like you said, people die from HIV and there still is no cure. There are also some diseases that we don't have good tests for that a person may not know they have, like herpes. Those are all good reasons to use condoms. So how come you are not using condoms every time you have sex? Listen to her answers and try to get her to make the conscious connection between using condoms and all the STDs she is worried about. A second communication technique is role-playing, or practicing some of the realizations gained during the choreographed conversation. Use terms like \"practice\" or \"rehearse\" instead of \"role play\", do not use teen language (neither current nor past slang) and continue to describe concepts in a simple, concrete fashion. What if your best friend says: \"Condoms are really gross. Why do you use them?\" What would you say? What if your boyfriend says, \"Why do you want to use condoms, don't you trust me? I've been checked for all diseases; I don't have anything.\" What would you say? Give positive feedback for the answers she gives and continue to prompt. A third technique is the decision tree, essentially a choreographed conversation written out on paper. Ask guiding questions to uncover alternate, often unintended, outcomes and use a writing surface to illustrate the process and help adolescents to visualize these potential outcomes. The product is a diagram representing a series of choices leading to the outcomes. An additional bonus of the decision tree is that patients can take home the diagram to contemplate further |A Sample Decision Tree| | | This decision tree was used with a 14-year-old female, who presented with a scleral hemorrhage in a school-based clinic. She became mad enough to fight when a girl insulted her mother. When asked what was going to happen next, she responded \"I'm going to kill her, that's why I brought this knife (which she had in her pocket) to school.\" When asked how that would make her feel, she responded, \"Good!\" When asked how long she would feel good she responded \"All day!\" She needed a technique that would allow her to contemplate future consequences, and that took into account how her actions would affect her mother since she was getting into this fight to protect her mother's honor. We slowly acted out the role-play with different scenarios and wrote down each possible outcome (that she thought of herself). It convinced her to engage in a process of conflict resolution. |UNDERSTANDING STRESS AND HELPING SOMATIZING PATIENTS| | | Adolescents face many stresses. Many teen behaviors, whether healthy or risky, are adaptations that serve to reduce stress. \"Negative\" behaviors are often very effective and attractive in the short term. Typical severe stressors during adolescent development are domestic violence, physical or sexual abuse, parental abandonment, and parental substance abuse. The discomfort of these circumstances, coupled with \"normal\" developmental stressors of socialization, differentiation and autonomy trigger coping strategies that lessen distressing feelings (Figure 1). As medical professionals, we acknowledge that behaviors we lament as highly risky, such as substance abuse, sexual activity, violence, self-mutilation, gang affiliation or disordered eating are often adaptations to stress. Of course, many teens develop \"positive\" coping strategies. \"Positive\" or \"negative\" does not reflect the utility of a given strategy at reducing stress, but our value systems. Unfortunately, some negative coping techniques are effective and highly reinforcing in the short term, but give rise to destructive consequences and additional stress. When the adolescent regularly engages in a specific risk-behavior, that behavior has become a coping mechanism, effective under the circumstances. Young people tend to be aware of the stressors, but few acquire the insight to connect risk-behavior with stress reduction. Our effectiveness in mediating change in teens' lives often improves when we help them connect the dots between stressors and harmful behaviors, in addition to exploring motivation and readiness to change, as discussed above. Building a trusting relationship supports the complex and at times painful conversations that energize and support patients while guiding them toward development of alternative coping techniques that serve as lifelong stress reduction tools. |Compassionately link unhealthy behaviors with stress reduction| | | Empathically collaborate with teens to assess both short and long-term effectiveness and consequences of behaviors; use a team approach. Listen for hints about sources of current stress as well as past stressors such as abuse, violence or drug use in the family, and for clues to how the teen adapts. Gently ask if the patient is able to talk more about a stressor or an adaptation. If a presenting complaint (such as somatization) or the risk-behavior seems stress-driven, explore the possible connection and discover whether the exploration helps the patient to gain insight. Emphasize that the teen has worked out a way to handle life circumstances. This compassionate framing not only helps lessen the shame associated with a risk-behavior but also empowers patients by demonstrating that they are actively making decisions and coping with life. Partner with patients, both to assess how effectively the current behavior serves to relieve stress, and to explore actual and potential negative consequences of the risk-behavior. It is not enough, therefore, for physicians to assess the readiness and motivation of teens to change; we must also help them explore why they are driven to these harmful outlets. Whether or not the risk-behavior is stress driven, we guide patients in development of alternate pro-social coping strategies they can use as lifelong stress reduction techniques. Helping teen patients understand why they continue harmful behaviors sometimes requires multiple visits as well as referral for multidisciplinary assistance from counselors, social workers and psychiatrists. |Addressing Stress and Risk-behaviors| | | You can approach discussing stress and unhealthy behaviors in an organized way. |Somatization is mysterious and embarrassing| | | Adaptation may produce physical symptoms. Facilitate healing through compassionate attentive listening to patients' and parents' stories and perspectives and by emphasizing known mechanisms that link stress to physical symptoms. Build trust and relationship through regular reassessment, listening and examining, but minimize testing. Some teens unconsciously relieve emotional stress through generating a somatic symptom for which they seek \"legitimate\" medical assistance, an effective but somewhat dysfunctional coping strategy. Like all people with \"medically unexplained symptoms\" (see module 31), adolescents rarely make the connection between mind and symptom. When the patient presents with somatic complaints and careful evaluation reveals no serious medical problem, consider the possibility that the symptom is stress-related. Address this consideration up-front, directly and with empathy. This will mean coordinating a delicate conversation with teens and parents, but the dialog is only marginally more (or less!) difficult than discussing coping behaviors that are more obvious risks to health. Do not keep thoughts that the symptom might be stress related to yourself, because both patients and parents will assume you are not attending to them and think you are not thorough enough at investigating with laboratory and other tests. Your major goal is to facilitate patients' healing by helping them understand how body and the mind are integrated. Ask about teens' and parents' perspective on the symptom, and listen attentively. Often your SSHADESS interview will have elicited significant current stresses,including past major stresses such as physical or sexual abuse. Sometimes you will diagnose a depressive disorder, which is often associated with somatization. Sometimes you will need to make a referral for counselling, explaining how the patient's emotional reactions are related to current symptoms. Current stresses that are not severe can still lead to somatization and will often respond to your empathic listening and counseling. Make the mind-body connection by explaining that stress causes physical changes--such as alterations in brain chemicals and secretion of stress hormones--and that these bodily changes result in physical symptoms. Raise the hypothesis that the symptom is another way your patient's system is adapting to stress. Minimize the shame that is always associated with raising this possibility by repeating that the symptom is one common, normal and predictable (but dysfunctional) result of the body's response to stress. Explore alternate coping strategies that include physical, spiritual, and creative outlets that can expand patients' current repertoire in handling stress. Support parents' concerns and legitimize their urge to shame their teen or accuse them of faking, as you brainstorm ways parents can resist the urge and join with their adolescent in a supportive manner. Reassure the family that your evaluation is thorough and continuing, and that you'll continue to address their concerns. Remain alert to the possibility of other underlying causes, continue reviewing the history and physical exam, but proceed slowly and cautiously with procedures that have their own risks and a tendency to divert attention away from the primary mind-body issues. |Check out the video example of beginning to counsel a patient who is suffering severe somatic symptoms.| |The Approach to the Somatizing Patient| |IDEAS FOR STRESS REDUCTION| | | These are suggestions for teens on dealing with stress. You should review the topics with the teen during the visit, but can also give the teen a handout to take home. |CONCLUSION| Helping youth discern what stress-relieving strategies work best for them is seldom achieved in one visit; neither is guiding teens completely away from risk-behavior. While we rarely witness an overnight transformation, we can help adolescents recognize and build on their existing competencies. We can help them not only to link risk-behavior with stress but also to learn the skills to initiate alternate strategies so as to lessen their reliance on unhealthy and dangerous solutions. Join with adolescent patients and their parents to develop trusting and non-judgmental relationships. Express your appreciation of their dilemmas and your respect for their successes, and use a strength-based approach to addressing risk-behaviors. Learn effective skills for exploring linkages between stress, behavior and symptoms, and for brainstorming new options and making new choices that build upon patients' existing strengths and facilitate additional successes in their lives. |RELEVANT BEHAVIORS| |LITERATURE Patients\" |by Brent C. Williams, MD, MPH and James T. Pacala, MD, MS | | | Authors: | | Brent C. Williams, MD, MPH and James T. Pacala, MD, MS | | Editors: | | 2.0 - 7/16/2009 - upgrade to version 4.0 of doc.com 1.1 - 7/15/2009 - Revision by the editors 1.0 - 11/26/2008 |Rationale| | | by Brent C. | Older patients are a large and growing portion of the practice of every physician who cares for adults. Communicating with older patients, many of whom have multiple complex, interacting problems can be daunting, especially when time is limited. In this module, we review techniques for communicating effectively with older patients, especially those with sensory, cognitive, and functional impairments, and for interacting with their caregivers. These skills and strategies assist physicians in making more comprehensive diagnoses as well as effective and informed joint decisions with patients and their caregivers during relatively brief encounters. We also provide a opportunity for learners to examine their own assumptions, values, and beliefs related to aging that may influence medical decision-making. We show how ageism, comprised of negative attitudes about the elderly, can influence care. |Ageism in Health Care| | | Learners' exposure to frail older adults who communicate poorly tends to result in negative stereotyping. The \"informal curriculum\" promotes ageism. When ageism is unexamined, it impairs trust and communication with both patients and colleagues, and diminishes the quality of care provided to elderly patients. Medical training exposes students and residents to a disproportionately ill population of older adults. Learners in the health professions interact less frequently with healthy older adults, who far outnumber those who are chronically ill or frail. Hospitals and chronic care facilities are filled with elderly persons who have complex problems that are difficult to diagnose and treat, and who frequently communicate slowly or poorly. Extensive and repetitive exposure to the sickest of older adults often results in negative stereotyping of the entire geriatric population by medical learners (1). Learning to provide high quality care to this population requires that students recognize and reflect on this bias, as everyone must do with other important stereotypes to which everyone is subject, such as racism or sexism. Ageism, like other biases, frequently operates at a subconscious level but nevertheless strongly influences the way we view older patients, provoking negative attitudes toward caring for them, inaccurate assumptions regarding their functionality and preferences for care, and erroneously poor estimates of their prognoses. This bias also adversely affects interactions with patients, impairing communication, trust and other important aspects of the doctor-patient relationship. Awareness of the effects of medical education on promoting negative attitudes, introspection into feelings about older adults, and interaction with healthy elderly can serve to minimize ageism. (2) Ageism can also insidiously affect how medical colleagues interact with one another. Negative comments regarding both elderly patients and physicians headed for careers in geriatrics abound in medical education settings, perpetuated by students, residents, and attending physicians. (3) These attitudes are typically fostered outside of formal educational settings and thus constitute an \"informal curriculum\" that promotes ageism. Upholding standards of medical professionalism requires that you do your part in creating a work environment that is respectful of patients and coworkers, through actions such as using respectful language when speaking of older adult patients, initiating conversation with a colleague who behaves or speaks inappropriately, and raising awareness of professionalism in the work place.Later in this module, several videos illustrate how attitudes can affect care of the elderly. |Give Yourself the Time Needed for Elderly Patients| | | Develop and use strategies that will prevent frustrations about time and the resulting impairment of trust. You will be frustrated if you enter a geriatric interview with the same temporal expectations you would have for interviewing a younger patient, and your frustration will likely result in behaviors that impair establishment of trust. It takes more time to interview older patients. Simply from having lived longer, they have more history to report, and their medical problems are often more numerous. Typical conditions of older adults, such as Parkinson's disease, strokes, or dementia, retard response times to your queries. Time constraints can be mitigated by: |Before starting the Interview| | | Review the patient's record, arrange the environment, check for comfort, vision and hearing, and decide whether to include a partner or caregiver. Prior to interviewing elderly patients, especially those with complex problems, review the record, even if only to refresh yourself about the patient's problems and medications. After arranging the physical environment for optimal communication, check the patient's comfort level and suitability for effective communication. Finally, before beginning the actual interview, make an explicit decision about whether or not a caregiver or spouse should be present, and make it so. While caregivers can often provide important information, the patient's wishes regarding their presence and input must be solicited and respected. Probably the simplest way to establish this is to ask the patient, |Communicate with Caregivers| | | Caregivers provide essential support for many older patients and are part of the care giving team. Communicate and collaborate with your patients' caregivers while maintaining patient autonomy and confidentiality. For older patients who receive ongoing care from paid or unpaid caregivers, the therapeutic relationship is no longer a dyad, but a triad. Caregivers are usually a family member, often a daughter or daughter-in-law, who accompanies the patient to visits and communicates with the physician or other clinical staff between visits. Remain patient-centered, negotiate confidentiality issues and be alert to patient-caregiver relationship problems. |Begin with the Patient| | | In private, ask patients about preferences about your communications with caregivers, seek permission to share information with caregivers, and ask about sensitive topics such as relationship with the caregiver and sexual activity. Spend time alone with the patient, at the beginning of your relationship and periodically thereafter. This usually means asking the caregiver to leave the room for a portion of the visit. Use simple, direct language. If caregivers raise concerns about leaving the room, these expressions are usually important \"openers\" to learn more about unspoken concerns, anxieties, stress, or tension between the patient and caregiver. Check with the patient about how they want you to communicate with caregiver(s) about their health, and specifically ask their permission to share information with caregivers. Establish confidentiality rules, even with patients with mild-to-moderate dementia. Emphasize that you can keep confidential any specific issues that might arise in the future. During your time alone with patients: Observed differences may be clues to the relationship between patient and caregiver. Be alert to the possibility that they amount to warnings of abuse or neglect. |Keep Patient at the Center| | | Greet the patient first and begin each interview by conversing directly with the patient even if demented or verbally impaired-- so that you can better assess the patient and also model effective communication strategies for the caregiver. For patients with impaired communication, you might explain your wish to begin with the patient by saying, As with any important conversation where time is an issue, you and the caregiver will likely need to negotiate and reach agreement on who talks when. Information from this negotiation process may help guide your patient interview as well as shed light on positive and negative aspects of the patient-caregiver relationship. |Include the Caregiver as a Member of the Healthcare Team| | | After patients give permission to share information with the caregiver, use the three-way conversation to assess the caregiver, coach the patient and caregiver about day-to-day management issues, and clarify priorities and values most important for the patient. Assess caregiver stress through direct inquiry, either with the patient present if rapport is strong and the patient and caregiver have demonstrated effective, open communication, or in a private conversation. If separate from the patient, you might briefly explain the purpose of the conversation by saying, The stress of caring for an impaired parent or other relative surprisingly often provokes abuse or neglect by people who are otherwise quite competent and stable, particularly if impairment is from dementia. \"Prescribe\" time away from the patient to alleviate guilt and decrease caregiver stress. Say something like, Provide caregivers with information and coaching on use of resources such as books (7), support groups, counseling services, and social workers who can advise them on local options for living arrangements and in-home support. |PHYSICAL, SENSORY AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS| | | With very simple measures, unfortunately often overlooked by busy physicians, you can overcome communication barriers that derive from patients' sensory, physical, or cognitive impairments. Many older adults have chronic conditions causing sensory, physical, and cognitive deficits that can impair communication with medical providers. When interviewing younger patients, we often safely assume that such deficits are not present. To facilitate effective communication with the older adult, however, you must check for such deficits and compensate for any that are present. Before getting started with the interview, you can first optimize the physical environment to facilitate communication via the measures described below. |Sensory Impairments| | | Patients cannot communicate well unless they can hear you and see you. Both conductive and sensorineural loss hearing deficits increase exponentially with age. Optimize patients' hearing with the following measures: |Click on the picture-button on the left to play a video in which Dr. Williams communicates with a hearing impaired patient.| Visual impairments increase exponentially with age, and stem from three main causes: refractive error, cataracts, and macular degeneration. To ensure optimal visual functioning, take the following actions before commencing with the interview: |Click on the picture-button on the left to play a video in which Dr. Williams communicates with a visually impaired patient.| |Physical Deficits| | | Ask about physical comfort and take measures to assure it. Older adults with conditions impairing posture or mobility pose other obstacles to effective interviewing. To eliminate the potential perception of a power differential between you and your patient and to facilitate communication, position yourself level with the patient's eyes. This may mean sitting or kneeling next to a patient in a wheelchair, and even sitting on the floor to look directly at a patient with a pronounced thoracic kyphosis. Older patients may have numerous conditions that render it painful to sit or lie in certain positions. As with all interviews, patient comfort must be maximized, and assuring comfort warrants a simple inquiry into a patient's comfort before beginning the rest of the interview. |Cognitive Deficits| | | Detecting and compensating for cognitive deficits is a complex and nuanced endeavor. In order to discern cognitive dysfunction, you will remain alert for clues that arise during your interview. Confirm deficits with formal mental status testing, and solicit information from caregivers. Minimizing sensory and physical obstacles to interviewing is relatively straightforward through direct inquiry and manipulation of the physical surroundings. Many cognitively impaired patients lack insight into their deficits, and those aware of impaired cognition may be defensive or embarrassed. You will usually discern impaired functioning by observing clues that surface through the course of the interview, rather than asking patients directly about cognitive status. The clues you may notice include the following signs of cognitive impairment: Keep in mind that social behaviors are retained in early dementia, so you can be easily fooled into thinking that a well-dressed, socially appropriate demented patient is cognitively intact. If you suspect the presence of cognitive impairment, you must confirm it through formal mental status testing during the physical examination portion of the patient visit. Before that, however, you can pose certain other questions during the interview to gather more information, such as the following: When you are having difficulty obtaining information from a patient that you suspect has cognitive impairment, soliciting further information from a caregiver or spouse (with the patient's consent) is often very helpful (see \"Communicating with Cognitively Impaired Patients\" section in this module). |GATHERING DATA| | | In this \"Gathering Data\" segment, we discuss how older patients' symptom descriptions differ from typical descriptions, with emphasis on vague and downplayed symptoms. We note that attention to structured routines- for example, about past history and review of systems- is of special importance in establishing diagnosis and making treatment plans with the elderly. This chapter is divided into two sub-chapters: |Gathering Data: Symptoms| | | Often, very significant or serious diseases in older patients do not present themselves as well-described symptoms or appear to you as typical syndromes. Explore symptoms carefully, despite their vague character or patients' downplaying of them. |Gathering Data: Routines| | | Certain elements of \"routine\" data gathering tend to have more importance in the management of your elderly patients. Attend to details about patients' psychosocial context, past history, medications and review of systems. |Understanding Patients' Functional Status and Preferences for Care| | | Decision-making with older patients is complex and nuanced, and frequently requires that you balance complicated medical conditions, patient values, and prognostic considerations. Establishing trust is an important goal of any patient interview, and holds true with older patients. General methods for fostering trust are considered in detail in Modules 5 and 6. Attend particularly to using open-ended questions at the beginning and to responding to both verbally and non-verbally expressed Geriatrics is a functionally-based discipline, and warrants respectful inquiry about a patient's living situation, functional status, outlook on life, and preferences for care. Some open ended questions that help to establish this information might include: See Modules 32 and 34 for interview strategies that assist with discussing and establishing care preferences. |Clarify Values and Care Preferences| | | Making good medical decisions depends on effectively helping patients and caregivers clarify their values and share their thinking with you. Effective medical decision-making is a mutual process between doctor, patient and caregiver, and physicians who assure that it is an open process within which each party shares thoughts and values about what is important and what should be done strengthens trust among the parties. Module 32 stresses that values discussions provide better guidance than asking about specific interventions such as chemotherapy, ventilators, feeding tubes or resuscitation. Modules 9-11 cover details about the complex process of finding the right decisions. Ask direct open-ended questions to elicit values, such as, Also, review hypothetical scenarios to enhance mutual understanding. This might sound like, |CHALLENGES: COMPLEX COMMUNICATIONS| | | In this \"challenges\" segment, we discuss how cognitively impaired patients' need for autonomy affects physician decisions about communications. In addition, collaborative conversations with caregivers must support patients' independence while maintaining confidentiality. Physicians must balance patients' interest in autonomy and independence against considerations of patients' safety. This chapter is divided into two sub-chapters: |Strategies for communicating with cognitively impaired patients| | | Too often cognitively impaired patients are \"left out\" of medical decision-making as well-intentioned physicians and caregivers plan for their safety. Optimize the balance (and resolve any conflicts) between your patients' independence in decision-making on the one hand, and their safety on the other. Medical decision-making is context-specific. Patients not capable of making decisions in some areas (e.g., safe driving) can possess decision-making capacity in othesr (e.g., timing or dose of medications). Patients who understand the options and consequences for a particular medical decision possess decision-making capacity in that context, even in the presence of underlying cognitive impairment. Assess cognitively impaired patients for decision-making capacity, and involve them in decision-making whenever possible. When patients cannot make medical decisions or provide informed consent to them, make decisions with the caregiver in the presence of the patient. Then, periodically \"check in\" to gauge patients' understanding and reaction to the options or recommendations under discussion. When patients have severe cognitive impairment and are unable to report symptoms such as pain or depression, observe their behavior and work with and coach caregivers in detecting distress. Some typical signs of distress are sleep disorder, agitation and tense facial expressions. (4) |Driving Motor Vehicles| | | Driving carries tremendous symbolic importance about autonomy, and any conversation about driving threatens and frightens cognitively impaired patients. Periodically review driving history with cognitively impaired patients and at least one observer. Initiate conversation about driving with the patient, and then include the caregiver. Taking the driving privilege away is fraught with distress, so act only on clearly observed and reported facts about deficits. If necessary, arrange for obtaining data from reliable observers. Guidelines on when to restrict driving in patients with dementia are available for both physicians (5) and families. (6) States do not agree on uniform criteria for restricting driving. Become familiar with laws and regulations in your state regarding required testing and find out who can call for mandatory testing against the patient's wishes (physicians, family). |COMMUNICATING WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS| | | Providing good care for older patients requires that multiple health care providers, usually including at least a physician, nurse, and social worker, perform as a team, developing the ability to openly express opinions, feelings and conflicts, and agree on processes for resolving disagreements. Quality care of older patients requires effective interdisciplinary teamwork. Conflicts may arise because team members on the one hand expect leadership from any physicians involved, while on the other hand they value a flattening of hierarchy, and want physicians to acknowledge the special expertise of team members. Many team members have little opportunity to practice skills that would help with negotiating such conflicts. Show that you respect the autonomy, the feelings and the ideas of other team members, and that you value their ideas and will strive to resolve any disagreements in a relationship-centered manner. Teamwork concepts are addressed in Module 38, and more specifically around the care of older patients in a \"case study.\" (10) |GERIATRIC ROUNDS| | | Working with acutely ill geriatric patients in the hospital often requires extra thoughtfulness, specific interviewing strategies and attention to your own and the patient's attitudes, values and goals of care. In these next two videos, Dr. Williams and two residents work with a patient presenting a difficult challenge in care, drawn from a recent patient admitted to Drexel's medical service. The \"patient\" is Mary Cote, M.D., a retired pediatrician. In the third video a panel discussion with all the players and with Dr. Walter Cohen, Drexel's Chancellor Emeritus, addresses all aspects of the case. | | Brant Williams MD plays the Attending in this video.

Goldstein, MD and Susan Swartz, MD, MPH | | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | by Smoking is the # 1 preventable cause of mortality in the U.S. Physician treatment of tobacco use is straightforward and cost-effective. Physician intervention for tobacco use and dependence is one of the most cost-effective interventions in health care. (Fiore et al, 2000) All physicians play an important role in influencing and helping smokers to quit. Evidence shows that training of residents or community providers to briefly counsel smokers promotes quitting behavior. (Ockene and Zapka, 1997) Demonstrating to providers that quitting is a process rather than an event- is a primary training goal. Just as smokers need to view temporary abstinence as a definite success, clinicians must recognize that every skillful brief intervention can change their patients' attitudes and behaviors. |Public Health Service Guideline| | | Strong evidence supports the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendation that tobacco intervention be a top clinical priority. Smoking causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and also complicates chronic conditions and pregnancy. The 2000 U.S. Public Health Service Guideline on the Treatment of Tobacco Dependence comprehensively reviews the evidence and concludes that brief advice - even less than 3 minutes - increases quit rates. (Fiore et al, 2000) A dose-response relationship exists between intensity of counseling and quitting, so more counseling achieves improved outcomes. The PHS Guideline details evidence for 3 effective treatments: behavioral counseling, pharmacotherapy (nicotine replacement and bupropion) and social support, both within and outside of clinical care. (Fiore et al, 2000) |Tobacco Use: A Chronic Condition| | | As with most complex and chronic diseases, patients need skillful guidance through repeated quit attempts and relapses before they achieve long-term success. Tobacco use is a complex behavior, woven into the fabric of a person's life. Quitting is a challenging process, and abstinence requires that smokers not only eliminate nicotine dependence, but also cope with living without tobacco. For most smokers the process is iterative and fluctuating with repeated cycles of abstinence and resumption of smoking. Hence, tobacco dependence is a chronic remitting and relapsing disorder, similar in this regard to asthma, heart failure or depression. As with any chronic condition, successful physician intervention depends on appropriate diagnosis and assessment of disease status, a trusting relationship and skillfully informing and advising patients. Further, a long-term view is equally fundamental when addressing tobacco dependence as it is to successful management of any chronic illness. When lasting abstinence is elusive, effective physicians continue to partner with their patients and discern strategies appropriate for the particular situation. |Dispelling Myths| | | Several myths, held by smokers and professionals alike, negatively affect interactions with patients Click the links below to learn about the myths in more detail: |Myth #1: Smokers don't want to quit| | | Fact: many smokers would like not to smoke, although fewer are ready to try at any given moment. \"Smokers don't want to quit\", expresses physicians' belief that smokers have little desire to quit. The belief is partly based on many smokers' statement that they enjoy smoking. The myth may also derive from the complex and often negative or painful dynamics of working with chronic behavioral conditions in medical settings. The data show that at least half of smokers are motivated to quit, and that at least half make a serious attempt to quit each year. A physician encountering smokers 2 or 3 times in a year may assume such smokers have been continuously smoking, when many have made one or more quit attempts during this period. |Myth #2: Smokers can quit if they really want to| | | Fact: long-term abstinence requires more than just an attitude or desire or \"willpower.\" Smokers constantly hear that cigarettes are a bad 'habit', one that can be 'kicked' any time. As a result, patients frequently lament, \"I know it's bad for me doc, I guess I don't have the willpower to give it up.\" This false line of thinking gives smokers total responsibility for quitting. Nicotine is a powerful psychoactive drug, and smoking produces psychological and physiological dependence to it. You can effectively treat nicotine dependence, and should work with smokers who want to quit just as you would manage patients with any other chronic medical condition. |Myth #3: Smoking treatments don't work| | | Fact: randomized clinical trials show that effective therapies such as behavioral counseling, medications, social support (from a physician as well as from others in the individual's social network), and repeated interventions increase quit rates, and long term abstinence. Patients frequently bemoan their sense of failure and frustration, saying, \"I tried the patch, and it didn't work,\" or, \"I did what you said, but I picked up again at a party.\" After any given encounter, even when experienced and competent physicians skillfully counsel their patients and employ the most effective treatments, only a few achieve sustained abstinence. Without a \"magic bullet\" for tobacco use, it is no wonder that health professionals share their patients' lack of confidence in treatments. They begin to doubt not only their own competence, but also their patients' motivation, and then find that their motivation to intervene decreases. But data discussed in the PHS Guidelines clearly show that most smokers who use combinations of therapies will achieve temporary abstinence, and that short periods of abstinence can be leveraged to increase patient (and physician!) commitment and confidence to try again. (Fiore et al, 2000) |Ready to quit | Introduction by Michael Goldstein MD |BRIEF INTERVENTION| | | Motivated physicians can master the special skills of short structured interventions about smoking and apply them every day in the course of usual patient care. A successful approach should be patient-centered, collaborative, and recognize the complexity of nicotine dependence as well as the process of behavioral change over time. A brief intervention for tobacco dependence can be delivered in any setting, including acute care visits, consultations, or at the hospital bedside. Designating an intervention as \"brief\" implies that the tobacco discussion takes only a few minutes during an encounter, not that the interaction is ineffectual or insufficient. |Intervention Benefits| | | Physicians and patients agree that smoking is harmful, and if physicians were able to follow evidence-based guidelines, both would be more satisfied, morbidity and mortality from tobacco would decrease, and time spent at visits would remain unchanged. Physicians frequently discuss tobacco use during clinical encounters, but less often deliver support and assistance with quitting . (Goldstein et al, 1998; Thorndike et al, 1998) Simple explanations for this discrepancy include lack of provider skills and competing demands during visits. More insightful study shows that myths about motivation, willpower and effectiveness combine with physicians' fears that smokers will be irritated and result in curtailment of discussion. We can debunk the myths with the facts and we can minimize patient irritation by mastering and using a handful of simple skills. Evidence shows that quality counseling can be achieved through physician training combined with prompts and other system interventions that support counseling efforts. (Ockene & Zapka, 1997) Tobacco dependence interventions derive from models of brief health behavior change counseling as well as patient self-management counseling for other chronic conditions, such as diabetes and obesity. (Whitlock et al, 2001; Goldstein et al, 2004) Strategies for management of chronic conditions, such as goal setting and self-monitoring are effectively employed with tobacco use. Using these brief intervention skills to address smoking has not been associated with longer visits. Patients report greater satisfaction with providers who discuss smoking cessation, deliver a higher level of preventive care and discuss behavior change. (Soldberg et al, 2001) |Quitting as a Process| | | Many apparently irresistible forces keep smokers smoking despite their ambivalence. You can help when you are willing to explore patients' feelings and beliefs about these forces and set realistic goals. Smokers think regularly about quitting, but are ambivalent about change; they want to change, and they want to stay the same. Productive and satisfying patient interactions arise when physician and patient collaborate to set realistic goals that aim to \"meet smokers where they are\". (Prochaska & Goldstein, 1991) Change is sometimes abrupt - for example, when a smoker quits after a heart attack, however, for most individuals, lasting behavior change requires multiple serious attempts at quitting. Strong physiological, psychological, and social factors impact on whether an individual will reach for another cigarette. For many, the quest for abstinence can be lengthy or seem impossible. Physicians who skillfully support patients through exploration of feelings, obstacles and options significantly shorten patients' journeys. (Fiore et al, 2000) |Words as Therapy| | | Smokers anticipate admonitions from their physicians; respectful communication of interest in patients' beliefs and context facilitates advice- giving and supports commitment to quit. Given the rise in cigarette taxes, smoke-free policies and public health programs that target tobacco use, patients who smoke are sensitive to criticism. Smokers expect to be admonished by friends, co-workers, family and health professionals. A judgmental question such as, \"You were just in the hospital with a heart attack -haven't you quit smoking?\" feeds into this expectation, heightens defensiveness, puts patients on guard and erodes their confidence. An alternative would be to state, \"I'm interested in hearing how things went with your smoking after the heart attack.\" Even better, listen carefully while reviewing the interval history, as many patients will bring up smoking, which allows the physician to respond most supportively, building trust and strengthening the relationship upon which both medical and smoking interventions depend so heavily. Take the initiative to tailor your comments so as to renew patients' interest in stopping, to support their commitment, and to explore ways to boost their confidence. |TOBACCO DEPENDENCE| | | Physicians who are motivated to understand social context and social pressures, patient and physician beliefs and feelings, and nicotine dependence, can skillfully respond to these forces and help patients overcome tobacco dependence. In this section you find more in-depth information about: |Nicotine| | | Nicotine's combination of stimulant and depressant effects, its quick uptake by brain tissue and its subtle but very irritating withdrawal effects produce addiction that is difficult to break. Most smokers begin at an early age, and quickly become addicted. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1988) Nicotine rapidly accumulates in the brain after smoking, achieving maximum concentrations within 1 minute. Nicotine has multiple stimulant and depressant effects that contribute to its addictive properties. Nicotine's almost instantaneous entry into neurons, in combination with its effects on brain function optimizes conditions for the development of physical dependence. Acute (minutes and hours) and chronic (weeks and months) tolerance to nicotine effects contributes to an increase in cigarette consumption, as people must smoke more to obtain desired effects, such as relaxation. Nicotine withdrawal is an important barrier to quitting, and a majority of smokers making a serious attempt to quit experience it. (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1988) Withdrawal signs and symptoms appear within two hours, usually peak after 24 to 48 hours, and typically last from a few days to four weeks. (Hughes & Hatsukami, 1992) Craving, increased hunger, and dreaming about smoking can persist for months. The mean decrease in heart rate is 8 beats per minute and the mean weight gain is 2-3 kg. Women tend to gain more weight than men when they quit smoking (3.8 vs. 2.8 kg) and a subset of both men and women gain in excess of 13 kg. Effective pharmacotherapy for managing nicotine withdrawal reduces symptoms of withdrawal and increases quit rates. |Intensifying treatment may help those who are more dependent| | | Ability to achieve sustained abstinence and to avoid relapse correlate roughly with intensity of dependence and relevant medical co-morbidity. Studies show that smokers more dependent on nicotine have greater difficulty quitting than less dependent smokers. (Niaura & Shadel, 2003), The Fagerstr\u00f6m Tolerance Questionnaire measures dependence; in an office setting, a brief Heaviness of Smoking Index can estimate the degree of dependence from answers to two questions: Individuals smoking within 30 minutes after arising, or smoking 25 or more cigarettes per day have higher levels of dependence. (Healtherton et al, 1989) Higher levels usually require more intensive interventions that combine behavioral and medication treatments. Relapse after quitting is common, and in randomized trials of pharmacotherapy, rates approach 80%. Outside of clinical trials relapse may be higher. Individuals with higher relapse risk, such as a smoker who has not been able to get through 24 hours of abstinence in the past, require more intense or longer active treatment. In contrast, someone who is able to abstain for 30 days or longer has a lower relapse risk. While duration of previous abstinence correlates with outcomes, no clear \"threshold\" duration that determines relapse risk is apparent. Medical or psychiatric co-morbidity also reduces the effectiveness of standard treatments, and most notably current or past major depression, or present depressive symptoms increase relapse risk . A history of any alcohol use disorder or current heavy drinking also increases relapse risk. (Hughes, 1996) These findings support the need for a consistent, well-integrated approach to treating tobacco use and dependence. Certain medical conditions may improve success with quitting. Improvement occurs in hospitalized patients undergoing coronary bypass or admitted for myocardial infarction.(Rigotti et al, 1994) In outpatient settings, it is not clear whether medical co-morbidity influences quitting. Any condition that is directly related to tobacco use provides a \"teachable moment\" and opportunity for physicians to deliver personalized messages to quit. |THE 5A's OF TOBACCO COUNSELING| | | Extensive research indicates that each of the 5A's skills and competencies contribute to effective outcomes of tobacco dependence counseling. Skillful \"basic\" communication techniques, pharmacotherapy, social support, assistance with problem-solving and physician support over the long haul also contribute to success at helping smokers quit. U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's Counseling and Behavioral Interventions Work Group recommends the \"5A\" framework (Table 1) for counseling patients about health behavior change. (see doc.com module 16). (Whitlock et al, 2002) Aspects of two of the 5A's are often overlooked by physicians, namely, assessing patient knowledge, attitudes and behaviors, and working collaboratively with the patient to agree on patient goals. Assessment permits the physician to tailor counseling to best meet the motivational and educational needs of patients. Agree refers to the process of collaborating with patients to choose goals that are realistic and appropriate. Table 1: The 5 A's [Modified from Whitlock, 2002] | | In addition to the 5As model, the PHS Guideline (Fiore et al, 2000) recommends that physicians: When you focus interview time on addressing tobacco use, your interaction differs in important respects from other interviews, but also contains many familiar elements. New skills relate to assessing readiness to change, and conviction and confidence about change. Aspects of familiar skills are shown in \"Essential Elements\" (see modules 6-12) of doc.com. In this module, we show how these skills form the foundation for modifications and elaborations in gathering information, (see module 8) understanding patients' perspectives, (see module 9) and sharing information (see module 10) as they converge in the 5A Model for helping patients change. The 5A framework, noted in doc.com module 16 and applied to tobacco counseling here, fits well with other behavior change models proven effective in enhancing smoking outcomes, including the Transtheoretical Model of Change (Prochaska & Goldstein, 1991) , Social Cognitive Theory Bandura, 1977) , Self-Determination Theory (Williams et al, 1998) and Motivational Interviewing (Miller and Rollnick, 2002). In the following sections, we describe the 5A's approach to Tobacco Counseling, providing examples of the skills for each \"A\". |Assess| | | The dialog below demonstrates guiding discussion to tobacco, asking permission to proceed, and using open-ended questions and reflections to begin your assessment. Prepare for a \"no\" answer when asking permission. Start by guiding the conversation to the issue of smoking and tobacco use. Specify your intention to help the patient to modify health risk behaviors. For example, you might begin with, \"I would like to talk with you about health behaviors and how you can modify these to promote good health. I noticed on the health history form you completed that you smoke.\" Pause here and allow patients to share something spontaneously about their smoking, providing implicit permission to go on. If they don't speak, ask permission to continue the discussion, such as \"Would it be OK to talk about your smoking and how it may be affecting your health?\" Once patients say YES, they at least agree to consider how smoking affects their health. When asking permission, however, be prepared for patients to say 'NO'. Though rare, if it happens, you can respectfully reflect disinterest with, \"Seems like you are not willing to talk about smoking today.\" Sometimes this simple reflection opens the door to further discussion. However, if patients reiterate their wish to avoid a discussion, you can say . \"Ok, though I hope you will be willing to talk about it sometime, because stopping smoking is the single most important thing you can do to reduce your risk for future illness.\" Asking permission to proceed gives patients control and helps minimize resistance to change. Once permission to proceed is granted, use open-ended questions to learn about the patient's smoking history, beliefs about smoking and its health effects, and their conviction (importance) and confidence about quitting. Use reflective listening to reflect back the meaning of what you heard, pausing to allow the patient to verify, correct, refine or add more information. The following dialog demonstrates elements of an initial assessment: Doctor: \"So I noticed from your history form that you smoke?\" Patient: \"Yeah I know I should give them up .it is not good for my breathing.\" Doctor: \"So, you're aware smoking is having a negative impact on your asthma you have been thinking of giving them up.\" Patient: \"Yeah, I'd really like to give them up ..my wife would like me to also .it's hard to think about getting through the day without them. I've cut down to about a pack a day, though .I used to smoke 2 packs. Doctor: \"I am glad to hear that you know quitting will help us to better manage your asthma and make your wife happy. Sounds like you have worked hard to cut down, but are concerned about how you would manage without cigarettes. Patient: \"I have never been able to quit...I think I'm pretty addicted..\" Doctor: \"So you think you are addicted to cigarettes based on your difficulty quitting. Sounds like you have tried .what was that like?\" Patient: \"Well, I used some nicotine gum but it bothered my teeth and gums ..so I gave it up after about a week and went right back to smoking.\" Doctor: \"That must have been frustrating. Yet, you managed to stay quit for a week?\" Patient: \"It was more like 5 days ..\" Doctor: \"Well that is an accomplishment!\" Patient: \"I never thought of it that way .but I guess you are right. I'd never gone more than a day without cigarettes before.\" |Building Relationship| | | In order to enhance motivation to quit and improve outcomes, build trust and safety in the relationship by using core skills such as reflections, affirmations, empathic statements and statements that normalize (\"legitimize\") patients' experience. The example above shows the utility of open-ended questions and requests, and the physician also uses a series of effective reflections to confirm data, allowing the patient to add and refine his views regarding his smoking. Note the affirmations (i.e., \"I am glad to hear\", \"you have tried\", \"that was an accomplishment\") and of empathy (\"you are concerned\" \"that sounds frustrating\"). Use of these core skills builds relationship and supports patients. These relationship-building skills are key elements of successful interventions, as they help patients disclose more about their feelings and beliefs, and attend better to your recommendations. (Miller and Rollnick, 2002) |Gauge Motivation to Quit| | | Assessment of motivational readiness, or stage of change improves physician effectiveness by enabling them to tailor interventions to patients' readiness. Many smokers are interested in stopping tobacco, but only some are prepared to take action to quit. This variation in motivation provides an opportunity to apply counseling evidence in a practical way. Physicians are most effective when they adjust their dialog to match a patient's degree of motivational readiness to change. A smoker in the stage of precontemplation doesn't agree that smoking is a problem, or has no interest in quitting in the foreseeable future. A patient in contemplation is ambivalent about quitting (wants to quit, wants to smoke) and has no explicit commitment to change in the near future. Someone in determination or preparation intends to quit within the next month, or made recent changes in smoking behavior, and a smoker in action recently quit and is actively using strategies to stay quit. Those in maintenance have been quit for at least 6 months but still need monitoring to prevent relapse. Relapse to smoking is a frequent (also read: normal) occurrence, and each smoker should be re-assessed after relapse to determine where they are in their motivational readiness to take action again. The Stages of Change model posits that change is a process of moving through several stages, not a sudden \"event\" of making change. (Prochaska & Goldstein, 1991) Many smokers tend to hover in contemplation. An action-based strategy, such as prescribing bupropion to a smoker in the precontemplation or contemplation stages of motivational readiness is both ineffective and frustrating for both you and the patient. In contrast, tailoring interventions to the patient's stage of change (e.g., reviewing information that increases contemplative patients' awareness of their smoking's effects on their health) is both more effective and more satisfying to physicians and patients alike.. (See the [Agree](04_300.htm) and [Assist](04_400.htm) sections below for more details on tailoring). |Gauge Conviction and Confidence| | | Asking about levels of conviction and confidence creates dialog. Further, physicians can ask , \"why not lower (or higher)?\" which helps to explore additional layers of patients' beliefs and knowledge, and facilitates tailoring of advice and assistance, contributing to success. Conviction is what patients believe about the value or importance of giving up cigarettes. Confidence, also known as self-efficacy, is what patients' believe about their ability to quit successfully despite obstacles or barriers. Gathering information about patient conviction and confidence about quitting helps to more fully assess a smoker's current level of readiness for change, and allows you to tailor the remainder of the dialog. You can use a numerical rating scale to clarify the extent of conviction and confidence a patient has about quitting. Figure 1: Visual Ruler (adapted from Keller & White, 1997) The following demonstrates how to use the conviction ruler to assess a young woman's motivation to quit smoking: Doctor: \"I would like to turn our attention to your heath behaviors. What about smoking?\" Patient: \"I'm still smoking but I have cut down to less than a pack a day.\" Doctor: \"I am glad to hear that you've cut down.\" At this point, how convinced are you that it is important to quit smoking, say on a scale of 0 10, where 0 is not at all important and 10 is extremely important?\" Patient: \"Right now?\". Doctor: \"Yes\" about a 5.\" Doctor: \"OK, a 5 .so somewhat important. What led you to say 5 and not lower?\" Patient: \"Well I know smoking is making my sinus condition worse and you have told me repeatedly about all the other problems it can cause.. it's just so hard to think about not having my cigarettes.\" Doctor: \"So, there are several reasons why quitting smoking would be beneficial. You would have less frequent sinus infections and less chance of developing several other serious medical problems, including heart disease and cancer. Anything else that led you to say a 5? Patient: \"Well, I am hoping to get pregnant in the next year or so. I know smoking would not be good for my baby.\" Doctor: \"You seem well informed about the risks of smoking during pregnancy.\" Patient: \"Yeah and so is my husband! He has been on my case as well.\" Doctor: \"So, he'd sure!\" Doctor: \"What would it take for you to feel it was even more important to quit smoking?\" Patient: \"I guess if I knew I would be able to do it .as I said, I don't know how I would manage without my cigarettes.\" Doctor: \"So you are worried about getting by without cigarettes. Tell me more about what you mean.\" In this example, the physician learned about the patient's beliefs. Note that \"What led you to say 5 and not lower?\" and \"what else?\" resulted in elicitation of this patient's reasons for quitting. In effect - she made her own argument for change! This technique, termed eliciting \"change talk\" by proponents of motivational interviewing, is associated with an increased likelihood of behavior change. Also, the physician used reflections to affirm and reinforce the patient's statements about the benefits of quitting, and then expressed empathy when starting to address patient concerns about her inability. Finally, the physician used the open-ended statement, \"Tell me more\" to begin an exploration of patient confidence. A dialog would typically continue with the physician asking, \"On the same 1-10 scale, how confident are you that you could quit for a month?\" and follow with, \"Tell me, what gives you the strength to say '5', and not lower than that?\" which elicits \"change talk\" expressing patients' strengths. (Note that asking \"Why are you not higher than '5?\" results in patients' talking about their limits, not their strengths. Addressing barriers is important, but better to begin with strong points.) (see doc.com module 16) |Advise| | | Whenever you bring up smoking, always include at least a brief bit of advice or information, asking permission to do so and personalizing it. Never lecture, and roll with resistance. Evidence shows that even very brief advice increases quit rates. (Fiore et al, 2000) Enhance your giving of advice by personalizing it based on patients' symptoms, risks, readiness, values and concerns. Providing advice before conducting an adequate assessment is counter-productive and increases resistance to change. This is particularly so for smokers with low conviction about the importance of quitting. Be cautious however, that advice does not become lecturing and judgmental statements. When assessment suggests a low level of readiness to quit, ask the patient's permission to briefly offer advice or information. Patients rarely say \"no\" and the act of asking supports patients' autonomy and increases their receptivity to the advice. Be willing to accept a \"no\", a difficult prospect for many health professionals. In this situation, you might add a reflection, for example, \"Sounds like you don't want my input right now.\" This is an example of rolling with resistance, a strategy that helps avoid the unproductive path of argumentation or persuasion-- a direction that always increases patients' resistance. Paradoxically, patients sometimes respond to such a reflection with statements that reflect some movement towards considering quitting, more \"change talk\". Consider the example below: Doctor: \"So, you are not considering quitting smoking right now. Would it be ok if I shared my thoughts about how stopping smoking will benefit your health?\" Patient: \"To be honest, Doc, .no I don't want any lectures .\" Doctor: \"So, you don't want to hear my advice right now.\" Patient: \"Well I know all about that scare stuff. I know smoking is not good for my health. I don't need you to tell me that. again.\" Doctor: \"I hear you. Sounds like you are already aware of the downside of smoking.\" Patient: \"Yes Listen, Doc, I know you are trying to do your job and I appreciate your concern ..I am just not ready to quit smoking.\" Doctor: \"OK ..well, when you are ready I'm here to help you.\" Patient: \"Sure .maybe after the holidays.\" Doctor: \"That would be great.\" In this example, asking permission to share information and use of reflections led to the patient's own expression of a reason to quit, \"I know smoking is not good for my health\" and even some interest in quitting in the future! The doctor responded to this \"change talk\" with affirmation. When advice is subsequently shared, personalize the advice by making links to improvements in health and well-being that the patient is likely to experience in the short-term or to other hopes or interests. See APPENDIX for Timetable of Benefits associated with quitting smoking. |Agree| | | Partnering to agree on goals is a crucial determinant of successful outcomes, and too often absent from physician-patient encounters. The active participation of patients in a goal-setting process is associated with improved outcomes in studies of dietary, alcohol, and diabetes self-management counseling. (Goldstein et al, 2004) Time you spend seeking agreement on clear and realistic goals is time well used. Ask patients to partner with you, to explore possible goals and to collaboratively determine which options are sufficiently specific, realistic and aligned with their readiness, conviction and confidence. Your goal for the encounter is to reach agreement with patients on outcomes for a specified time (such as the next visit) that are both desirable and achievable. |Set Realistic Physician Expectations| | | Use partnership skills to help patients choose their own realistic achievable goals, even if less than abstinence. Having realistic and specific goals enhances the likelihood of successful change, and encourages small successes instead of big failures. Create a collaborative process by eliciting and clarifying patients' goals, articulating your clinical goals, and then finding common ground or negotiating a compromise. Demonstrate your collaborative stance by using partnership skills (see doc.com module 6), eliciting patients' perspectives (see doc.com module 9), and expressing acceptance of their views in a nonjudgmental way. Agreeing on an achievable goal is more important than persuading patients to agree to an \"optimal\" goal - which they many not actually desire, or which they are incapable of reaching. The goal patients agree to choose often falls short of abstinence now and forever- the most healthful outcome. As an informed health professional, you may have difficulty \"settling for less\" than optimal behavior change goals. Of course, patients are in full control of their actions after your encounter, and remembering this fact facilitates your relinquishing control over the final agenda. Giving up trying to control or persuade helps lower patients' resistance, and increases likelihood of engaging them in making progress toward optimal outcomes at a later time. |Adjust goals to patients' motivation| | | Assure that you and patients agree on goals that are based on patients' conviction, confidence, overall readiness and past experiences. When smokers have little intention to quit, a sensible physician expectation is for them to think about stopping, an aim that is notably more modest than expecting them to quit. For such patients, you might state, \"Should you become more interested in trying to quit in the future, I am ready to support you and talk about the best treatments available.\" For smokers ambivalent about change (contemplating), a sensible expectation for the encounter is to present quitting as possible. Present any previous quit attempts as learning opportunities, sources of data about barriers and steps to success, so as to increase patients' confidence in future attempts to quit. A sensible goal for visits with smokers preparing to quit might be to provide education about therapies and information about why they help, particularly because many smokers believe they must \"quit on their own.\" Many patients have no idea that \"willpower\" is enhanced by actively partnering with physicians and receiving continuing support and empathy from them. When a smoker is clearly ready for action and a quit attempt, the typical encounter goal is to offer counseling and medication therapy, integrated into a quit plan. Table 2 provides examples of encounter goals and related messages that are adjusted to readiness... Table 2. Tailor messages to goals for the encounter. (Swartz 2004) | | If Patient Reports | | Goals for Patient Encounter | | Examples of Messages |Not ready to quit smoking||Think about quitting ||\"Quitting smoking can be difficult.\" | \"What do you like about smoking?\" \"Is there any reason you might think about quitting in the future?\" \"It sounds like you're not thinking about quitting right now. If you want to talk about your smoking any time, please let me know.\" |Wants to quit but not ready right now|| | Enhance desire to quit |\"Tell me about any time in the past you tried to quit smoking.\" | \"It's understandable that you have mixed feelings about smoking.\" \"Is there anything in particular that might motivate you to try and quit?\" \"There are better methods to help you quit now than ever before.\" |Ready to quit now|| | Develop treatment plan |\"It's important to set a quit date.\" | \"Getting added help such as medications or counseling can really increase your success.\" \"What are your plans if you get cravings for cigarettes?\" \"We need to talk or meet again, I want to see how you're doing\" |Recently quit|| | Maintain abstinence |\"You should feel proud of yourself.\" | \"Are others supporting your efforts?\" \"Is there anything we can do to help you stay off cigarettes?\" |Recently relapsed|| | Re-assess motivation | | \"You should feel good about trying to quit.\" In the example below, the physician begins dialog about realistic goals. Doctor: \"So, to summarize, you tried to quit smoking several times in the past, and were able to go without smoking for about a week. Once when you used nicotine patches, you had fewer problems with cravings. Right now, you're thinking about quitting again.\" Patient: \"I am frustrated about my smoking, but also about my weight. I think I need some more help to be successful.\" Doctor: \"OK. I'm hearing that you might try to quit again, but don't want to gain weight.\" Patient: \"Right. I can't afford to gain 20 pounds.\" Doctor: \"What are your thoughts about what you would like to do now?\" Patient: \"Well, I would like to quit. I read there are pills to help you quit, and not gain weight.\" Doctor: \"It's great that you're considering another try. Several medications can help increase success with quitting while limiting weight gain, and we can review medication options as well as talk about other strategies that might help limit weight changes when you're not smoking?\" Patient: \"That would be great.\" Doctor: \"So, you're ready to quit smoking, and you are willing to take medications and consider other ways to limit weight gain after quitting.\" Patient: \"Yes, I'd like t try using medicine, and I am willing to consider other options too. In this dialog, the physician summarizes the assessment data and clarifies the patient's readiness. The patient desires to quit smoking and wants treatment that will help limit weight gain. The physician reflects the patient's concerns about weight gain and expresses willingness to help address that barrier. Through this process, the patient and physician have collaboratively set a goal to quit smoking using medication and perhaps other strategies. This sets the stage for the next element of 5As counseling, Assisting the patient to develop a specific plan. |Assist| | | Once an encounter goal is collaboratively set, your role shifts to assisting the patient develop a realistic plan to achieve it. After they agree on a goal, physicians assists patients to develop a specific plan for achieving the goal. The assist process builds upon the output of first three A's (assess, advise, agree). For maximum effectiveness, choose the strategies to assist the patient based on the goals established during the \"agree\" process. In the following subsections, we outline skills that help tailor and specify action plans based on patients' readiness and common barriers. | | Check out the video example on the left where Michael Goldstein shows a 4 minute intervention. |Assist: Ready to Quit (action)| | | For smokers who want to stop, collaboratively choose a date and develop a quit plan. Identify supports, resources and barriers, and brainstorm and choose action steps to overcome the barriers. Help patients identify a \"stop date\" - preferably within a few days or weeks of the visit. Then, at a minimum, give them self-help materials, offer medications to reduce withdrawal, and provide information about local in-person programs and telephone quit lines. Assist patients with high conviction but low confidence by identifying resources and strategies that enhance confidence and skills. Praise their decision- this supports autonomy. Affirm past small success and appreciate patients' traits or attributes that you perceive as strengths- this supports self-efficacy. Problem-solving toward a feasible plan works best when patients identify strategies themselves. Ask patients, \"What problems do you foresee when you will try to not smoke? What obstacles have you had in the past?\" Listen, reflect the concerns, and then ask, \"What ideas do you have about overcoming such challenges?\" If patients have no ideas, or generate a partial solution, offer your ideas. Identify what went wrong after a period of success and brainstorm what else could be put in place to achieve a more durable result. Explore potential supports in patients' family and social network. Enlist members of the clinical team to teach the patient specific coping and self-management skills. Office staff can provide support with brochures, internet resources, referral information, and arrange follow-up. | | Assist Strategies According to Readiness to Change: Ready to Quit Physician: \"You've set a date to quit. Can you tell me - what challenges do you see for you when that quit day gets here?\" Patient: \"Well, I don't have much trouble not smoking at work. You have to go outside the parking lot, or sit in your car and I don't like doing that because I smell like smoke. But when I get home, it gets pretty tough.\" Physician: \"It's not convenient to smoke at work, and that supports your success during the day. When you get home, that's another story. What is it about being at home that makes it hard?\" Patient: \"When I come home, I want to relax and unwind, and smoking helps me do that. I usually watch the news and have 2 or 3 cigarettes then.\" Physician: \"So, smoking and watching TV go together after work. What about last year, when you told me that you quit for a month what did you do after work?\" Patient: \"Well, it was easier then because I lived with my boyfriend, who didn't smoke, and we spent time together, took walks, cooked dinner \" Physician: \"OK, last time you quit, you were able to distract yourself at home. What could you do this time?\" Patient: \"I could spend more time with my daughter and call friends on the phone.\" Physician: \"I wonder if these same challenges will happen on the weekends, too? Would it be helpful if you could write a list right here about some ways to distract yourself outside of work.\" (Jointly the physician and patient brainstorm a list). Physician: \" any other challenges you can think of?\" Patient: \"Well, I seem to do OK for a week or so, and then I have trouble concentrating.\" Physician: \"You might not be aware, that trouble concentrating is a common symptom part of what's called nicotine withdrawal. It varies from person to person, but sometimes can last as long as a month. Two types of treatments can help with this: one is medication that can help reduce those symptoms. The other is getting counseling or coaching by a tobacco treatment specialist.\" Patient: \"Do you mean a stop smoking class?\" Physician: \"That's one option. The other is a quit line, a free telephone program that provides individual support to help you get through the day. They call you back several times to see how things are going.\" Patient: \"I've heard about the quit line, but I can't imagine getting what I need by phone.\" Physician: \"Many of my patients had the same reaction. They tried it and found that it was a big help. Quit lines help many smokers quit. Would you be willing to give them a call? I can have our nurse write down the contact information.\" Patient: \"I guess I could.\" Physician: \"Ok, sounds like you have a plan. Can you just summarize for me?\" Patient: \"Sure let's see I'm going to list some activities to distract myself at home, like talking with my daughter. And I'll call the telephone smokers' line.\" Physician: \"Great. I'd like to see you or speak to you in a few weeks.\" |Specific treatments and resources| | | Tailor tobacco dependence treatment plans, based on medical conditions, smoking and quitting history, and patient preferences. Assess their confidence before making final decisions. Provide brief, supportive messages and offer appropriate medication therapy to patients with low levels of dependence and high conviction (more than 7). In contrast, and despite high motivation, smokers with higher levels of dependence or higher risk for relapse may need more intense behavioral therapy, either in the office or with a professional tobacco specialist. You could usefully try higher doses of nicotine replacement therapy or combinations of medication therapies. Be certain that you offer these patients access to some kind of concurrent counseling. Promote use of state-funded or health plan telephone counseling, both of which are now widely available.(Zhu et al, 2002) Learn about local counseling programs, so that you can present them to patients as credible and valuable. Patients who try nicotine therapy alone and relapse may prefer a non-nicotine medication or a combination of medications. Help patients avoid the \"it didn't work\" mind-set, by reframing relapse after abstinence for several weeks as a success rather than patients' typical notion that the medication \"failed to help them quit.\" Use the quit experience to empathetically determine whether the treatment plan should be altered, non-judgmentally discuss options, and collaborate on decision-making. Assess patients' confidence to implement the plan before closing a session. If their confidence rating is less than 7, they are less likely to succeed. Reasonable strategies here include working to identify and resolve barriers until confidence is at least 7, or renegotiating and agreeing on a goal and plan that patients believe they can achieve with confidence of at least 7. |Assist: Not Ready to Quit| | | For patients who reject even the idea of change, arguing about change or presenting more data is a frustrating and impolite waste of time. Make minimal factual statements (not admonitions), respond with empathy, and ROLL with RESISTANCE Very low conviction and very low confidence can be loosely equated with feeling helpless and hopeless. Patients need both a strong conviction and at least modest confidence before you and they invest energy on changing. Many patients with high uncertainty about the need for change (low interest or conviction), or high uncertainty about their ability to change (low confidence) cannot agree on a change goal.. Striving for active steps toward quitting in this circumstance is fruitless, frustrating, a waste of time and erodes trust. Align your perspective with their position and explore whether you can jointly increase conviction and confidence. Mindfully loosening your natural urge to forge ahead is not \"giving up\", it is acknowledging the complexity of helping relationships. With respect to behavior change, outcomes are entirely dependent on patients' actions. Physician communication and other actions may influence outcomes, but only patients fully determine them. Aligning yourself with patients is the best way to create new opportunities for finding common ground. Do not fail to provide some feedback and information (from one sentence to many exchanges, depending on patient responses) so the patient knows what you advise them to change and that you think the change is important. This might involve your wish to improve their heart condition or minimize risks for lung disease. After you present this information, steadfastly refrain from trying to persuade them to believe something or do something that is not very important to them, or about which they feel hopeless. Listen attentively to patients' experience, responses, perspectives and feelings, and seek to understand their low level of conviction. Talk about the conviction ruler, \"What makes it a 1 and not 0\" or even, \"Zero that's as low as you can get what would have to happen to make it a 1?\" You might find an opportunity for an affirmation, such as \"So, you realize that there are some potential benefits to change\". Legitimize the challenge for patients by reflecting on how hard it is to quit smoking. When providers say, \"Sounds like it's been tough for you quit\", the patient's struggle is validated. He or she also hears something that says 'I'm listening to you'. Show that you wish to understand by reflecting back statements or the content of questions or objections. This kind of reflection is called \"rolling with resistance\", and research shows that it often (not always!) encourages patients to think more broadly, to examine pros and cons, to trust you more, and to value and invest in the relationship. At the very least, your skillful active listening, accurate acknowledgement of their situation and alignment with their perspective helps them keep coming back for more conversation instead of feeling frustrated with your lack of understanding or your unwillingness to meet them where they are. |Simple short interventions for those not ready to quit| | | Advise getting minimal information, thinking things over, exploring conviction more deeply, and checking on hopelessness. For simple interventions that communicate your concern and expertise to any patients who smoke or use tobacco, recommend written information, brochures or online resources (such as [www.ahrq.gov](http://www.ahrq.gov) or [www.quitnet.com](http://www.quitnet.com) -associated with the Boston U School of Public Health), or talking with people who have quit. Ask smokers to pay attention to the details of their behavior and discuss their feelings with you at a following visit. Patients can make progress if you non-judgmentally help them to explore their ambivalence by using the conviction ruler, eliciting and discussing the pros and cons of changing or problem-solve with them about why they feel they cannot succeed. More information on these skills can be found in modules on promoting behavior change, alcohol disorders, diet and exercise, and substance abuse (see doc.com modules 24,25,29,and 30). | | Assist Strategies According to Readiness to Change: Not Ready to Quit |Assist: Help for Relapse| | | Help patients who relapse to combat shame and hopelessness and stay engaged with change. Give empathy, support and additional information, and brainstorm barriers and solutions to barriers. When patients try to abstain, nicotine withdrawal symptoms provide strong impetus to smoke. Smoking provides instant relief (it feels miraculous), and relapse within a few days is commonplace. As a common outcome of attempting behavior change, relapse, at a minimum, demonstrates adherence to the quit plan. Unfortunately, the barriers to success are too strong. Relapse is an opportunity to reassess. Reassess motivation, provide more information about nicotine withdrawal, and explore feelings and supports. Patients easily become discouraged and disillusioned when their dependence is high, nicotine withdrawal is uncomfortable and other supports are inadequate. Some patients will be ready to try to quit again, while others may require additional boosts of conviction or confidence before they try again. Continuing to build relationship, and identifying and encouraging small steps toward change are important, if not essential, for promoting patients' continuing engagement in the process of change. | | Assist Strategies According to Readiness to Change: Quit and Relapsed |Arrange Follow-up| | | Arrange personal or telephone follow-up for patients in any stage of readiness, to check results, celebrate successes and review potential changes in conviction or confidence. Patient follow-up is part of the smoking intervention, just as physicians routinely follow up patients with hypertension, diabetes or asthma. Contacts can be either face-to-face or by telephone. For smokers attempting to quit, at least four contacts (including the initial visit) appear optimal for achieving sustained abstinence. (Fiore at al, 2000) Follow-up visits can be brief. Assess response to treatment, make any needed adjustments to medication and continue to provide supportive messages for quitting. Proactive telephone counseling is an effective support technique that can be conducted by any clinical staff. If a patient experiences relapse, continuing medications may be appropriate if the patient agrees to quickly set a new stop date and try to resume abstinence. However, if assessment suggests the patient is not motivated to develop a new quit plan, discontinue the therapies. Schedule a future visit to reassess the patient and consider a new treatment plan. Follow-up is important even if a patient seems not ready to quit. Brief advice, even during a single encounter, may tip the balance for some smokers, who then go on to make important and lasting change. Strategies for success at closing visits and arranging follow up can be found in doc.com module 12. |CONCLUSION| | | Physician intervention for tobacco use and dependence is one of the most cost-effective interventions in health care. Brief advice, even less than 3 minutes, increases smoking quit rates and there is a dose-response relationship between the intensity of counseling and smoking cessation outcome. The 5 A's counseling approach (Assess, Advise, Agree, Assist, Arrange) is a useful way of organizing and tailoring tobacco use counseling and can be applied to all patients who smoke, including those not ready to commit to quitting. Expressing empathy and building a supportive, trusting relationship are keys to successful counseling. Assessing patients' readiness to change, their conviction about the importance of quitting, and their confidence about quitting enables you to tailor counseling and increases your counseling effectiveness. When patients are not ready to quit, agree on a goal short of quitting (e.g., thinking about quitting, cutting down), examine patient's pros and cons for change, use reflective listening, provide empathic support and personalized advice. When patients are ready to commit to quitting, review past experiences and collaboratively choose among various evidence-based treatment options. When smokers relapse after trying to quit, affirm successes, re-assess their conviction and confidence about quitting, and agree on a new goal based on their current readiness. Patient-centered, respectful and tailored 5A's counseling, when combined with evidence-based pharmacological and behavioral treatments, not only enhances outcomes of tobacco dependence treatment but also increases satisfaction for both patients and physicians. |RELEVANT BEHAVIORS| PREPARE ASSESS ADVISE AGREE ASSIST Modify Assist strategies for different Stages of Change, as follows: ARRANGE |LITERATURE REFERENCES| |APPENDIX: Benefits of Quitting Smoking Over Time| Benefits of quitting smoking begin within minutes and additional benefits build over the years.

Williams, M.D., Ph.D. | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | Geoffrey |The Patient's View| |The |Key Principles:| |Learning goals:| |BACKGROUND| | | The topics covered in the first section of this module are: |Why should physicians or health care practitioners do the counseling?| | | Over 300,000 premature deaths per year in the US are attributable to unhealthy diet and physical inactivity (1). More than one third of people born in the U.S. 2000 will get diabetes (Type 2) before dying (2). \"Trans fats\" are found in high percentages in U.S. foods (e.g., margarines and fast foods) and are a major cause of cardiovascular disease (3). Trans fats now appear on all food labels. Balancing energy intake that includes daily physical activity of 60 minutes at a moderate level (walking 3-4 mph) would dramatically lower rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, obesity, and cancer. |Always consider patient nutrition and physical activity together| | | Despite major public health efforts, Americans are growing more obese, resulting in an increased prevalence of chronic illness. Unfortunately, fewer than a third of patients receive lifestyle counseling from physicians. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 provide evidence based recommendations to balance energy intake and expenditure in order to prevent major chronic diseases (e.g., Type 2 diabetes, several cancers-including colon cancer-, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and degenerative arthritis) and to improve health and quality of life (4). American jobs have become increasingly sedentary, and Americans now are unlikely to expend enough energy during work to maintain physical fitness or a healthy body weight. Over the past two decades portion sizes have increased dramatically (\"portion distortion\"- [http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/portion/](http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/portion/)), and have left patients and physicians unable to identify healthy serving sizes (5). Obese adults underestimated their daily caloric intake by 47%, and overestimated their daily energy expenditure by 51% even before this increase in portion size began (6). American adults gain an average of roughly 2 lbs per year (7). Together these \"forces\" have led the average American to become overweight or obese (60% of Americans), and to get inadequate amount of physical activity to maintain health (only 15 % are active at the recommended level, and 40% are sedentary). Yet, less than 30% of patients currently receive lifestyle counseling from their physician (8). It seems that health care practitioners need as much motivating to do this counseling as patients need to make dietary and physical activity changes. It is likely that physicians are the most potent motivators of patient life-style change, based on studies of counseling about tobacco and alcohol. This is because physicians have unique access to patients, and because patients solicit and respect physician advice. Doctors have a greater impact on population health than any other single health practitioner (9, 10, 11). If health care systems assist physicians to provide counseling and a second type of health care provider is involved, the counseling is even more effective (12). |COUNSELING PRINCIPLES| | | In this section, the following topics are covered: |Motivation| | | Motivation is energy directed at a particular goal. You can energize your patients by having positive relationships, supporting their autonomy and promoting self-efficacy. The field of health psychology has several theories of motivation that inform practitioners how best to counsel patients to change behavior (11). Motivation has two components: psychological energy and direction. Physicians need to account for both these components of motivation to provide effective counseling. The \"direction\" of motivation has to do with negotiating agreement with the patient on the health goal to be achieved. Thus, establishing clearly agreed upon goals for nutrition and physical activity becomes crucial to successful change. Psychological \"energy\" to reach those goals is felt to come from a variety of sources: positive relationships that support patients unconditionally, higher levels of autonomous self-regulation of the patients, and higher levels of perceived efficacy (or competence). Patients are likely to hear advice to change their behavior several times before they will begin efforts to change, and then are likely to try several times before they can maintain the change over time. There is a very strong dose response relation between amount of contact time and successful change in tobacco abstinence, yet even simple advice statements from physicians increase abstinence rates 5 months later (12). It is likely that nutrition and physical activity counseling will also be more successful with greater contact time and with additional health care workers integrated into the support system (13). In this module, we recommend you spend 6-9 minutes on counseling for diet and nutrition, and physical activity, and to repeat this counseling over time (14, 15). |Support of patient autonomy| | | Promoting patient autonomy, defined as patient willingness to engage in a behavior, is motivating, yields better health outcomes and is fully consistent with engaging patients in the process of informed decision making (16, 17). Supporting autonomy serves as a clinical end-point for all health care encounters. Thus, not only is supporting autonomy associated with behavior change and better health, it is essential to providing ethical clinical care. Researchers identify seven physician behaviors that support autonomy, and reduce the likelihood the patient will interpret the recommendations as controlling. These behaviors include: |Physical activity and nutritional recommendations from Dietary Guidelines 2005 and beyond| | | As a physician, you are an important motivator of change. Your patients will likely need to discuss change several times before trying to change and attempt change several times before being successful. Physicians need to be able to provide specific recommendations in a straightforward manner that patients experience as motivating, and not as controlling. Patients are more likely to change if physicians initiate these discussions (20). Ongoing follow-up is needed because most patients are unlikely to change on the basis of a single discussion, and most patients will need to attempt change several times before being successful. Key Recommendations from the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005: |THE WAVE AND REAP TOOLS| | | The WAVE and REAP have been validated for use in brief physician discussions of nutrition and physical activity with patients. The WAVE assesses weight, activity level, variety of intake and excess intake. The REAP assesses food intake. In order to do this assessment and counseling in typical times allotted in primary care visits, the Weight, Activity, Variety, and Excess (15, 21) and the Rapid Eating and Assessment for Patients (15, 22) assessment tools are recommended to provide quick tools validated for primary care providers to assess and discuss weight, physical activity, and eating habits that affect health. Counseling based on the WAVE and REAP is intended for general nutrition counseling, such as during physician visits. If the patient has hypertension, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) is recommended by the Diet Guidelines (4). The DASH Eating Plan is available at [http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf](http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf). The PREMIER trial demonstrated persons with hypertension can sustain multiple lifestyle changes that improve blood pressure control over 18 months (23). If the patient has multiple dietary, multiple medical problems, or is not able to make progress in achieving dietary goals in a reasonable amount of time (generally 3 to 6 months), then they should be referred to a dietician for further dietary assessment and counseling. |The WAVE Tool| | | The WAVE instrument can be downloaded as a double sided pocket guide at The WAVE has two sides; one for assessment, and the second for recommendations. Each side is divided into four quadrants related to each letter of the acronym. The assessment side is intended to answer the following questions: The recommendations side is to be used to guide your counseling once those questions are answered. In order to assess whether the patient's \"variety\" of foods meets nutritional standards, and to determine if the patient eats an \"excess\" of calories from a particular food group, the practitioner can complete a quick 1 day 24 hour food recall (estimated to take 3-5 minutes), compare foods eaten with the Food Pyramid recommendations, or complete the REAP with patients. |The REAP Tool| | | The REAP tool can be downloaded from Patients can complete the REAP (written at the 5th grade level) in the waiting room to shorten time (estimated 10 minutes). The intervention using the REAP is illustrated in this module. | | Specifically, the REAP assesses intake of the following: | | The REAP also assesses whether the patient: |COUNSELING| |In this section you'll find the following topics coverd:| |The 5A's| | | As a physician, you should use 6-9 minutes of counseling for behavior change on physical activity and diet. This counseling is recommended for life style change as part of National Guidelines for Hypertension, Hypercholesterolemia, Diabetes and its prevention, Cardiovascular Disease, Physical Activity, and Obesity. The 5 A's include: (see also doc.com module 16) |Integrating the WAVE and REAP into the 5A's Diet and Physical Activity Counseling| | | Regular counseling about diet and physical activity are needed for Americans to reach Healthy Goals for 2010 (24). As you are learning the specific content outlined below, please consider your own motivation for incorporating the 5A's into your medical practice. You will need to adapt your office system to support your counseling practices. Most physicians will need multiple change attempts to maintain using the 5A's in practice. Gradual change in your practice is likely to be more successful than trying to master all of the material at once. The specific tasks needed to complete the 5A's are outlined in the following paragraphs. Much of the content of the counseling has been adapted from Blackburn & Waltman (14) to fit the 5A's format. | | Mr. R. is a 49 y.o. advertising executive who has been very successful in his work.

Is this the most you have weighed?\"| |Mr. R: \"Yes. It's hard to resist all the food we have at our meetings. We encourage people to work through lunch by providing good food.\"| |Doc: \"Well, you are experiencing what most Americans are-gaining 2-4 pounds per year, because jobs and diets like yours and mine no longer allow us to burn enough calories to maintain our health.

However, I wonder if you could find any reasons that might be worth to make changes yourself.

What are your thoughts about this?\"| |Mr. R: \"I don't like the sound of having diabetes, or a heart attack.\"| |Doc: \"It is hard to think about yourself having diabetes, or heart disease.\"| |Mr. R: \"I've never really had any illnesses before.

By 'healthier' I mean you would be less likely to get diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers if you choose better quality foods and were physically active each day. I'd like to work with you on this if you are willing.\" Ask if the patient understands your recommendation, and for his perspective about what you have said. Answer any questions. Be prepared to acknowledge that this represents a big change. |AGREE| |Doc: \"You can avoid these, but it is a reasonably difficult change.

How much time do I have to exercise?\"| |Doc: \"I feel the physical activity is the most important part for your health. I want you to do whatever you can to start a new pattern of daily physical activity that you can continue. I suggest 15 minutes a day of walking at 3-4 miles per hour for the first week, then increasing to 30 minutes a day in the second week. Further increases will depend on your weight goals. Do you think you can make room for this daily physical activity?\"| |Mr. R: \"That will be a stretch, but I think I can do that by taking a walk after dinner.\"| |Doc: \"Here are some general guidelines about physical activity that you can use to guide how much you do in the long run. 30 minutes a day of walking provides a lot of health by protecting you from diabetes, heart disease and colon cancer. The problem is you will likely still gain weight. 60 minutes of walking at 3-4 miles per hour will keep you very healthy and your weight neutral. Here's the bad news, it takes 90 minutes a day of walking to lose weight for most Americans.\"| |Mr. R: \"I can't believe it takes so much time to lose weight. There is no way I can do that with my schedule. Does it have to be all at one time?\"| |Doc: \"It does sound like a lot, but that's because the portions we eat are way too large. No, you don't have to do the physical activity all at once. You could do six 10 minute walks to keep your weight neutral. Every additional step improves your health, and burns calories, but it takes 20 steps to burn a calorie, that's about an hour of walking to burn off one candy bar with 250 calories.\"| |Mr. R: SILENCE| |Doc: \"It seems daunting, doesn't it-do what you can just walking over the next 8 weeks. Perhaps you won't be able to make any change.\"| |Mr. R: \"Well, I feel I need to do something about this sooner or later, lets try now.\"| |Doc: \"Build up gradually adding 10 or 15 minutes of walking per day each week to get to your goal. If you want to exercise harder than that, it takes time, but I would like you to get a stress test first before you exercise vigorously. Then, I'd like to see you back and discuss what went well and where it didn't. Try not to be hard on yourself. What would be a reasonable physical activity goal for you?\"| |Mr. R: \"I'll try to get to 20 to 25 minutes per day and see what happens.\"| Summary of physical activity assist: |ASSIST, Reduce Calories| |Doc: \"That would be a great start. The second thing I'd like you to do is to learn to read food labels, so that you know what and how much you are eating. I have an example label here for you. The most important things on the label are to understand portion sizes so you can reduce your calories and to avoid all trans fat-if possible-because they cause heart disease. Trans fats now appear on all food labels in the U.S.| In order to complete the next two parts of the discussion on reducing portion size and eating healthier food, first review the following information: |Determine Patient's Daily Caloric Needs| | | To quickly estimate the patient's daily caloric needs you will need to know the patient's age, gender, and whether they are sedentary, moderately active, or active. Derive caloric need from Baylor's Web-page [http://www.bcm.edu/cnrc/caloriesneed.htm](http://www.bcm.edu/cnrc/caloriesneed.htm). You might find the following web-page [http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/menuplanner/menu.cgi](http://hp2010.nhlbihin.net/menuplanner/menu.cgi) (interactive menu-planner) also helpful. Walking is a helpful measure of physical activity (PA). See Table 4 on the Web-Page of the US Department of Health and Human Services about Dietary Guidelines [http://www.health.gov/DietaryGuidelines/dga2005/document/html/chapter3.htm](http://www.health.gov/DietaryGuidelines/dga2005/document/html/chapter3.htm) for information about caloric needs per physical activity. |Understanding and Controlling Portion Sizes| | | In order to reduce caloric intake successfully, your patient needs to know how to read a food label and how to estimate a serving size. Ask your patients to look over a sample food label and whether they feel comfortable understanding it. Ask patients if they can identify one or two of the following serving sizes based on everyday objects. Some basic strategies from Blackburn and Waltman (14) include reviewing how to read a food label, and teaching the patient in the Assist Step to identify a portion size by comparing it to everyday objects he or she is familiar with. Additional strategies to reduce portion size include: |Behavioral Strategies for Weight Loss| | | Record your weight frequently - Keep a food diary - Monitor your daily physical activity pattern A recent study by Wing and Hill (25) found that patients who maintained weight loss of 30 lbs or more for a year engaged in very specific behaviors: weighing themselves weekly, eating breakfast daily, and being regularly physically active. Those who choose to eat healthier and get regular physical activity will need additional skills: |Set specific goals| | | Set specific goals with your patients for the various food groups. Be sure to set realistic expectations. The thrust of your recommendations is to have them move away from the typical American diet which is high in red meat, saturated fats, and refined flours to one that is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats and low fat dairy products. If they can't agree in principle to the overall direction of change, it is best to know that now. Review the REAP questionnaire with your patients. If agreeable, introduce each of these goals and ask if your patient is willing to make some change toward one or more of these goals working with you or with a nutritionist. Choose quality foods: Be physically active (e.g., walking at 3-4 miles per hour) for 30 minutes per day. |ASSIST, Reduce Calories cont.| We return to the interview between Mr. R. and his physician. |Mr. R: \"I try to eat healthy foods, I just keep gaining weight.\"| |Doc: \"You filled out that questionnaire in the waiting room. I'd like to look over that with you, now. Were there any areas, like grains or meats that you were interested in changing? You might pick one or two areas for this time and we can consider others at your next appointment.\"| |Mr. R: \"I would like to cut down my red meat, and I could do without one of the drinks I have each night.\"| | | Doc: \"Those are both changes that can improve the quality of your diet and reduce your calories. Your body can only use 4-6 ounces of protein each day. The rest is converted to fat, and alcohol has no nutritional value. Perhaps that walk after dinner will replace your second drink. We have covered a lot of territory today. I will make some notes about your goals.\" Summary - \"CQE\": 1. Cut calories 2. Choose Quality Foods 3.

Remember to set modest goals you can live with. It is difficult to make long-term change all at once, but I have confidence that you can improve your health and reach your goals over time. I'd like to see you again in about 8 weeks, is that okay with you?\" |Mr. R: \"Sure\"| |CONCLUSION| | | Improve your patient's outcomes related to diet and exercise by giving basic advice and utilizing strategies of proven effectiveness to establish personalized plans. Provide basic advice to cut calories, choose good quality food, and exercise daily. Your strategies will focus on supporting motivation, assisting in skills building and assisting in getting additional support. First, support motivation. As a physician, you can be an important motivator of nutrition and physical activity change. Begin with a collaborative discussion that includes evaluation of nutritional intake and physical activity. Be positive that your patient can change. On return visits, be attentive, respond to affect and remain empathic; if your patient has not been successful, acknowledge any frustration and remain non-judgmental. Identify any short term successes and indicate that most people need to try more than once to succeed. Suggest that your patient choose a specific date in the next 2 weeks to renew change efforts, and remind that you will continue to help. Next, assist in skills building and problem solving. Spend the time to introduce to every willing patient the basic concepts of calories, reading food labels, serving size, and the health benefits expected from living in energy balance that includes 30 minutes of daily physical activity. Patients with medical problems requiring specific nutritional changes (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus) should be directed to a more specialized diet (e.g. DASH for hypertension) and to a dietician. Finally, assist in getting additional support. Ask your patient to bring important others to your visits, and advise your patient to discuss plans and ideas with friends, family and co-workers, and seek their support to make changes. |RELEVANT BEHAVIORS| |REFERENCES| |Welcome to doc.com Module 26: | Anxiety and Panic Disorders |by Steven E. Locke, M.D. | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | Steven Locke, MD |The Patient's View| |The Principles:| |Learning goals:| |INTRODUCTION| | | Anxiety disorders are common in medical practice, but frequently missed because patients present with somatic symptoms that lead to a medical workup. Anxiety disorders are serious medical illnesses that affect approximately 19 million American adults (1), filling their lives with disabling anxiety and fear. Unlike episodic anxiety caused by a stressful event such as a business presentation or a first date, anxiety disorders are relentless, and can grow progressively worse. Effective treatments are available, and research is yielding improved therapies that can help most people with anxiety disorders lead fulfilling lives. Anxiety disorders are common in primary care, with prevalence about 15%. Primary care patients usually have relatively mild symptoms, and the anxiety disorder is often co-morbid with depression, substance abuse, or somatization. (2) Each anxiety disorder carries distinct features, but the common theme of excessive, irrational fear and dread binds them together. Most common, and most confusing to distinguish from medical disorders that produce symptoms of anxiety are generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Primary care physicians less often encounter obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia (or social anxiety disorder), and specific phobias. In this module we will focus on the more common Generalized Anxiety and Panic Disorders. First, though, we will review the basic approach to anxiety in medical patients. |Physical or emotional?| | | Anxiety disorders are quintessential \"mind-body\" disorders that mock medicine's outdated view of the mind and body as separate entities. Distressing physical symptoms usually lead people with anxiety disorders to primary care physicians. Particularly if symptoms such as dizziness, shortness of breath, palpitations, muscle tension, or sleep difficulties are worsening or recurrent, they mislead patients and their physicians. In the frequent fruitless search for a \"physical\" disorder, physicians overuse tests and procedures. In the absence of skilled explanations, the unnecessary expense and negative results make patients more anxious and dissatisfied, and they worry that their frustrated doctors are thinking \"the problems are all in your head.\" Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The complex pathophysiology involves the brain and peripheral nervous system, the autonomic nervous system and both central and peripheral elements of the neuro-psycho-endocrine system. This module enables you to discern when common physical symptoms belong to a medical condition that is masquerading as an anxiety disorder, and far more commonly, to discern when to provide specific treatment for the anxiety disorder in which distressing and disabling physical symptoms suggest an occult medical disorder. A principal therapeutic tool for anxiety disorder management is your skillful conversation that informs and encourages patients, that is not defensive about testing (or NOT testing!), that responds to patients' perspectives, and that consistently shows your empathy and positive regard for patients. |Who should be assessed for anxiety?| | | Use frequent screening, and use validated tools to solve the problem of high prevalence vs. low diagnosis. Anxiety disorders are so prevalent in primary care settings and so frequently undiagnosed that we recommend annual anxiety screening for every patient. Many patients have a high risk, but their other problems frequently divert attention. Important groups include patients with chronic illnesses (diabetes, heart failure, CAD) patients with unexplained physical symptoms such as pain, fatigue, neurological symptoms, and patients undergoing major life transitions such as job loss or caring for a sick family member. In addition, when you are concerned about an anxiety disorder during an acute care visit, screen the patient using a brief standardized assessment tool. Finally, for patients with an intrinsically high risk of anxiety or depression, screen even more frequently than annually. |APPROACH TO THE ANXIOUS PATIENT| | | If patients appear anxious, or have multiple somatic symptoms not obviously connected to a medical problem, consider that the patient might have an anxiety disorder. Take a careful history, listening for anxiety related to known diseases, and for possible medical conditions that can lead to anxiety. Gather information about medications, including herbals and OTC meds, and attend carefully to the psychosocial history. Ask about \"stress\" and listen actively, getting details of the stressful situation and the patient's emotional reactions. Ask about substance use and abuse, depressive symptoms, and past history of anxiety and panic attacks. |Anxiety in the medically ill| | | There are many psychological reasons why a medically ill person might be anxious (3), including: |Co-morbid Depression| | | Depression often accompanies anxiety disorders (4) and, when it does, it needs to be treated as well. Nearly half of patients with anxiety disorders also have major depression, and nearly half of patients with depression have an anxiety disorder. Symptoms of depression include feelings of sadness, hopelessness, changes in appetite or sleep, low energy, and difficulty concentrating (M 27). Most people with depression can be effectively treated with antidepressant medications, certain types of psychotherapy, or a combination of both. |Responding to anxious mood| | | You can rely on your basic rapport-building skills to respond to a patient's anxious mood. Five basic skills have been discussed in Module 6: reflection, legitimation, support, partnership, and respect. When you notice that a patient appears anxious, it is usually helpful to make a brief reflective comment, e.g., \"You seem quite [tense][restless][nervous][anxious][upset] (select a descriptive word that seems to reflect the patient's experience). If you can identify what you observe that leads you to the statement, mention it if they seem perplexed by your observation. \"Well, you are fidgeting and are restless and seem to be having a hard time concentrating on what we are discussing. Is there something that is distracting you? Can you tell me about it?\" A simpler approach might be: \"I can tell this is upsetting for you to discuss.\" Usually this type of comment is helpful, but not always. Some patients with anxiety also suffer from shame sensitivity and may feel criticized or even humiliated by the clinician commenting on their obvious anxiety. In this instance, you will need to defuse the stigmatizing power of the observation by mentioning how common these symptoms are and that by recognizing them early, effective treatment can be started. Empathic comments about the observed symptoms will serve many purposes it lets the patient know you are listening and observing. It gives the patient \"permission\" to talk about the feelings. And it communicates a sense of emotional support to the patient. When you listen and respond empathically, sometimes the anxious patient will allow more of the associated sadness to emerge after hearing this type of facilitative comment. The patient's eyes may even tear up or he/she may start to cry. |DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ORDINARY ANXIETY AND CLINICALLY SIGNIFICATN ANXIETY DISORDERS AND PANIC ATTACKS| | | Patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) have \"free-floating\" anxiety, characterized by an over reactive nervous system that can lead to physical symptoms. If I were to point a gun at you, it's likely that you would become anxious. Your heart would beat faster and could pound, your palms would become sweaty, breathing would become rapid and shallow, your mouth would become dry, and intestinal motility would increase. That is adaptive anxiety and a component of the \"flight or fight\" response described by Cannon. But what if merely pointing a pencil at you produced the same full set of responses? That inappropriate response would be an indication of the presence of an anxiety disorder an over reactive nervous system easily triggered by otherwise neutral stimuli. Some people with those characteristics suffer from repeated and frequent elicitation of the flight or fight response and end up with a chronic state of \"free-floating\" anxiety. What for some individuals might be ordinary daily worries and concerns for the anxious person can lead to persistent physical and emotional symptoms of distress making up the condition known as \"generalized anxiety disorder\" or, GAD. |DSM IV Diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorders| |A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).| |B. The person finds it difficult to control the worry.| | | C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months). Note: Only one item is required in children. |D. The focus of the anxiety and worry is not confined to features of an Axis I disorder, e.g., the anxiety or worry is not about having a Panic Attack (as in a Panic Disorder), being embarrassed in public (as in Social Phobia), being contaminated (as in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), being away from home or close relatives (as in Separation Anxiety Disorder), gaining weight (as in Anorexia Nervosa), having multiple physical complaints (as in Somatization Disorder), or having a serious illness (as in Hypochondriasis), and the anxiety and worry do not occur exclusively during Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.| |E. The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.| |F. The disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism) and does not occur exclusively during a Mood Disorder, a Psychotic Disorder, or a Pervasive Developmental Disorder.| |Panic Attacks| | | Panic attacks are feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning. People who have panic attacks can't predict when an attack will occur and one result is that people develop intense anxiety between episodes, worrying when and where the next one will strike. When repeated panic attacks lead to persistent or recurrent worry about future attacks, the condition is known as panic disorder. If you are having a panic attack, most likely your heart will pound and you may feel sweaty, weak, faint, or dizzy. Your hands may tingle or feel numb, and you might feel flushed or chilled. You may have nausea, chest pain or smothering sensations, a sense of unreality, or fear of impending doom or loss of control. You may genuinely believe you're having a heart attack or losing your mind, or on the verge of death. Panic attacks can occur at any time, even during sleep. An attack generally peaks within 10 minutes, but some symptoms may last much longer. Lifetime prevalence estimates are almost 1 out of 4 persons for isolated panic attacks (without agoraphobia) and almost 1% for panic attacks with agoraphobia but without panic disorder (4). |Panic disorder| | | Panic Disorder is common, disabling and treatable. Many physicians do not make correct diagnosis or offer treatment. Suicide is a tragic outcome. Panic disorder affects about 2.4 million adult Americans (1) and is twice as common in women as in men (5). Lifetime prevalence for panic disorder is almost 4% (without agoraphobia) and just over 1% for panic disorder with agoraphobia (4). It most often begins during late adolescence or early adulthood (5). Risk of developing panic disorder appears to be inherited (6). Not everyone who experiences panic attacks will develop panic disorderfor example, many people have one attack but never have another. For those who do have panic disorder, though, it's important to seek treatment. Untreated, the disorder can become very disabling and lead to secondary depression. Many people with panic disorder visit the hospital emergency room repeatedly or see a number of doctors before they obtain a correct diagnosis. Some people with panic disorder may go for years without learning that they have a treatable illness. Panic disorder is a painful condition and associated with suicide, especially when accompanied by depression. This is especially tragic because it is one of the most treatable of the anxiety disorders, responding in most cases to medications or targeted psychotherapy. | | Steven Locke, MD, is the Physician in this video |Agoraphobia| | | Disorders such as substance abuse and depression often accompany panic disorder; at times it evolves into agoraphobia. Panic disorder is often accompanied by other serious conditions such as depression, drug abuse, or alcoholism (7,8) and may lead to a pattern of avoidance of places or situations where panic attacks have occurred. For example, if a panic attack strikes while you're riding in an elevator, you may develop a fear of elevators. If you start avoiding them, it could affect your choice of a job or apartment and greatly restrict other parts of your life. Some people's lives become so restricted that they avoid normal, everyday activities such as grocery shopping or driving. In some cases they become housebound. Or, they may be able to confront a feared situation only if accompanied by a spouse or other trusted person. Basically, these people avoid any situation in which they would feel helpless if a panic attack were to occur. When people's lives become so restricted, as happens in about one-third of people with panic disorder (5) the condition is called agoraphobia. Early treatment of panic disorder can often prevent agoraphobia. |Screening questions for panic disorder (9)| The first two questions have 94% sensitivity to detect panic disorder if either is positive. | | |CHALLENGES OF ASSESSMENT| | | There are three basic challenges in the assessment of the anxious patient: |Eliciting the symptoms of anxiety| | | Eliciting the symptoms of anxiety can be very straightforward. If patients seem anxious, you can make a reflective comment, as mentioned above: \"You seem worried (or nervous, or anxious)\" as a way of beginning your inquiry. If the patient acknowledges anxiety and worry, you can proceed with asking questions related to GAD and Panic Disorder presented above. There is even a brief, simple questionnaire that you can use with your patients, or that patients can complete in the waiting area if you are using screening tools. The questionnaire, the GAD-7, was developed by a team led by a leading psychiatric epidemiologist and included a highly respected general internist who specializes in mental health issues in primary care. GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 represent cutpoints for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. Though designed primarily as a screening and severity measure for generalized anxiety disorder, the GAD-7 also has moderately good operating characteristics for three other common anxiety disorders panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder. When screening for individual or any anxiety disorder, a recommended cutpoint for further evaluation is a score of 10 or greater. (10) At a cutpoint of 10, the following sensitivity and specificities have been reported for four common types of anxiety: |GAD = 10 or greater||GAD|| | Social |Panic Disorder||PTSD| |Sensitivity||.89||.74||.72||.66| |Specificity||.82||.81||.80||.81| This means that when using the GAD-7 as a screening tool in primary care, anyone with a score of 10 or greater would have an 89% chance of being detected if they had GAD (11% false negatives). And they would have an 82% likelihood that if they were positive on the GAD-7, they would actually have GAD (true positive). There are seven cardinal symptoms of GAD: |Over the last 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by the following problems?||not at all||sev- | eral days |more than half the every day| |Feeling nervous, anxious or on edge| |Not being able to stop or control worrying| |Worrying too much about different things| |Trouble relaxing| |Being so restless that it is hard to sit still| |Becoming easily annoyed or irritable| |Feeling afraid as if something awful might happen| In addition, because almost half of the patients with an anxiety disorder may also have an undiagnosed depressive disorder, it is useful to screen the patient for depression as well. This can be done by asking \"Have you been feeling sad, blue, down in the dumps?\" \"Have you noticed that you don't enjoy things as much as you used to?\" If the patient responds positively to either one of the two above questions, you should then facilitate the patient's open-ended discussion, saying something like, \"Could you tell me a little more about your feelings of sadness or your loss of enjoyment?\" If depression is suspected, then you should initiate a more thorough assessment for depression, as outlined in Module 27. |Differentiating Anxiety Symptoms from a General Medical Condition or Adverse Drug Effect| |Medical conditions that cause anxiety| Sometimes the symptoms of underlying diseases can lead to symptoms that can be misdiagnosed as an anxiety disorder. When asking about the symptoms of anxiety, you should also maintain an index of suspicion about the presence of certain diseases. Ask questions and do the requisite physical exams that will help you distinguish. Some of these diseases are the following: |Medications that cause anxiety:| | | There are a wide variety of medications that can cause anxiety (3). The classes of these medications include: |Helping the patient to understand how anxiety can be the basis for their persistent or recurrent physical symptoms| | | There is considerable social stigma concerning all mental illness, including anxiety. As a result of stigma, many patients will be embarrassed to disclose anxious concerns or symptoms of panic or may simply deny its presence. This intentional minimization of symptoms of anxiety can create conflicts between doctor and patient if the clinician pursues the diagnosis aggressively. For many patients, the use of alcohol to self-medicate symptoms of anxiety is culturally sanctioned while seeking medical care is a shameful sign of weakness. To give an example, the patient with chronic illness, physical complications, and significant life stress may have trouble sleeping, have trouble concentrating, constant worries, and an inability to relax. When the doctor asks something like, \"Are you anxious?\" the patient may respond by saying something like, \"Of course I'm worried, Doctor, who wouldn't be worried, with all these physical problems and all the stress I am under.\" When the patient sounds annoyed after such an inquiry, your suggestions for treatment recommendations for the anxiety are not likely to be appreciated. How can you respond to a challenge like this? First of all, you should not argue with the patient and fall back on authority. It is NOT helpful to respond by saying something like, \"Well, I do think you're anxious even if you are not aware of it.\" It is more helpful to reassure the patient and support his/her defense, while ALSO encouraging a different way of looking at the situation. Responses like the following are often helpful: \"Many people in your shoes feel exactly like you feel. The kind of problems and stresses you have been having would certainly be upsetting for almost everyone. Over the years I have learned that when people struggle with these serious problems for a long time, their body begins to run out of the chemicals that help us cope with stress. That depletion can lead to a chemical imbalance which makes it even harder for you to cope and function effectively. Put anyone under enough stress for long enough and they will start to have difficulty functioning at the level they usually can manage easily. In these high-stress situations, certain medications and self-management tools can really help. What do you think?\" |MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES| | | Once the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder has been made, the clinician has the challenges of: |Presenting the diagnosis| | | Presenting the diagnosis of anxiety can often be a challenge. Many patients with anxiety come to the primary care doctor's office with chief complaints relating to physical symptoms like dizziness, headaches, muscle tension, and/or insomnia. They may not experience their problems as related to anxiety, so they are understandably disturbed when the doctor attempts to \"explain away\" their symptoms as caused by anxiety. Do not get caught in the trap of discounting physical symptoms in the effort to properly diagnose and treat anxiety. Maintain a two-armed or multidimensional approach: treat the physical symptoms with respect and concern, evaluate them and treat them conservatively and responsively. However, also treat the anxiety as an independent cause of suffering and disability. For example, the patient with irritable bowel syndrome and a clinically significant anxiety disorder should be managed with the two-armed multidimensional approach, such as: \"I understand the stomach pain and bloating is a big problem. We want to do a few more tests but I am going to go ahead and prescribe a new medication that should reduce your bloating and cramping. However, I also believe that stress and anxiety are making your symptoms even worse and that the stress and anxiety needs treatment as well if you are to get your symptoms fully under control. Let's talk about how we can treat the stress and anxiety, too.\" |Addressing \"barrier\" health beliefs and denial| | | Stigma about mental illness and depression is widespread and serves as both the cause and result of \"barrier\" health beliefs. Ask about beliefs. What are these barrier health beliefs? The most important barrier health belief is the notion that mental disorders are a sign of weakness. It is a barrier health belief because it serves to discourage a treatment alliance between doctor and patient. How can the doctor recognize the presence of a barrier health belief and what can be done about it? The only sure way to recognize the presence of a barrier health belief is to ASK. The doctor can say something like: \"I think your anxiety is contributing to your symptoms What do you know about anxiety? How do you feel about the diagnosis of an anxiety disorder?\" The patient's answer to these questions will uncover health beliefs that can profoundly affect a working alliance with the patient. If the patient says something like, \"Only weak people get anxious,\" you have some insight into factors that may lead to non-adherence and has an opportunity to respond directly to the patient's concerns. You can then say something like, \"I understand how you might feel this way. It seems clearthat anyone exposed to enough stress will develop an anxiety disorder and it has very little to do with a person's strengths or weaknesses. You may have heard that one-third of the soldiers returning from Iraq have mental disorders from the extreme stress they were exposed to.\" Denial of anxiety can be the most troubling patient response to manage, especially if the patient has fallen back on self-medication with alcohol or other substances as a substitute for treatment. When asked a question about anxiety, the patient may simply state, \"I am not anxious.\" How can the physician respond to that? These are patients who often are out of touch with their emotions and do not understand the mind-body connection. Recommendations for behavioral treatments are often rejected by such patients in a dismissive fashion. I have had success recruiting such patients for clinically-effective mind-body group programs by acknowledging that standard medical care has been a disappointment to them as well as to their clinicians but that many people with symptoms like theirs have enjoyed considerable relief from distress by participating in a mind-body educational program that teaches meditation and stress management. By removing the recommendation from the domain of mental health and repackaging it in terms of health education, stigma is avoided and adherence achieved. |Education| | | Once the diagnosis has been presented to the patient, you can explain the concepts of anxiety and panic. Education begins with an assessment of the patient's current knowledge: \"What is your understanding of anxiety?\" After responding to the patient's emotional and cognitive concerns, you should make short, concrete, clear statements explaining the condition. Examples might include something like: \"While everyone has occasional worries or fears, an anxiety disorder is a different story. For a variety of reasons, such as your genetic inheritance, your age, and the stress you are under, you are secreting too many stress hormones, and these give you the symptoms you are having. People with panic disorder have feelings of terror that strike suddenly and repeatedly with no warning. They can't predict when an attack will occur, and many develop intense anxiety between episodes, worrying when and where the next one will strike, and this level of anxiety may make another attack more likely. If you are having a panic attack, most likely your heart will pound and you may feel sweaty, weak, faint, or dizzy. Your hands may tingle or feel numb, and you might feel flushed or chilled. You may have nausea, chest pain or smothering sensations, a sense of unreality, or fear of impending doom or loss of control. You may genuinely believe you're having a heart attack or losing your mind, or on the verge of death. However, panic disorder, once correctly diagnosed, is easily treated and can usually be controlled. It's a physical condition and nothing to be embarrassed over. Would you like to learn about the various treatment options? |Negotiation of a treatment plan| | | Discuss treatment options flexibly and approach patients with empathy. Because many patients will resist accepting the diagnosis of anxiety or resist starting treatment, either counseling or medication, the physician should assume an open-minded attitude of flexible negotiation to the encounter. The doctor cannot simply tell the patient what he or she must do. It is better if the doctor offers the patient choices, with a statement like: \"You have an anxiety disorder that usually responds very well to treatment. There are several different treatments available. Anxiety responds to treatment with medication. And anxiety also responds to treatment with counseling or psychotherapy. Some people prefer treatment with both medication and counseling, which is often the most effective treatment. There are also some self-management approaches that appear to be effective for mild anxiety. My personal recommendation for you now is that you consider treatment with both medication and counseling. Would you be interested in these treatments?\" Some patients who refuse treatment at the time of first diagnosis may agree to treatment at a later point in time. Or they may be open to some conservative self-management approaches such as exercise, meditation, and stress management. You should always leave the door open to future treatment. Thus, an approach called \"watchful waiting,\" is the next best alternative. Inviting significant others into the discussion can also be helpful. You can then say something like, \"I understand that you are not interested to start treatment now. I would like you to think some more about what I have said, perhaps talk to your husband (or wife, or parents, etc) and even bring him (or her or them) to your next appointment. We will watch you closely and see how you feel them at your next appointment in say, two or three weeks?\" You might also want to try some self-help approaches during this time to see if they can make a difference. |Self-management support (SMS)| | | You can help your patient with chronic illness by supporting the patient's self-management. The \"5 As can be useful. Anxiety is a chronic, recurring illness. Sometimes it is a life-long trait. Like patients with other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart failure, patients with anxiety who learn and accept the responsibility for self-management of their illnesses have the best quality of life and the best long-term outcomes. You can help your patient with chronic illness by supporting the patient's self-management. One model for guiding self-management is known as \"the 5 As of Self-Management Support\", based upon the work of Kate Lorig, Russell Glasgow, Albert Bandura, and Steven Cole. The 5 A's are presented in detail in Module 16. Here we offer examples of how the 5As are useful in ongoing support of patient self-management. Assessment On followup visits, patients with ongoing anxiety symptoms may not have addressed contributory factors that can precipitate or aggravate anxiety, or new issues may have arisen. Inquire about: The next step is to determine what efforts to control anxiety has the patient already made and with what results? Based upon patients' responses, what has previously helped? Are they willing to return to doing what has helped in the past? Do they want to try something different? Can they do this on their own or do they need a coach to guide their self-management program? How motivated is the person to change? Assessment also needs to address possible reasons for medication non-adherence. \"Many patients find it difficult to take their medication as prescribed for a variety of different reasons. Has this been true for you?\" IF YES, CONTINUE: \"Sometimes people stop taking their medication because of unpleasant side effects.\" Have you experienced side effects that led you to discontinue your medication?\" Advice refers to education about illness or the usefulness of behaviors that often help patients manage anxiety. The following is an example of an advice statement a physician might make, \"I understand how hard it is to take the medication every day. I need to explain to you that some medication takes a few weeks of regular use to start working the way it is supposed to work. If you don't take it regularly, it really doesn't have a chance to start working. If you are having difficulty remembering to take it, I have some suggestions that many of my patients have found very helpful.\" \"Patients with anxiety usually tolerate caffeine poorly. It often makes anxiety worse and should be eliminated from your diet. That can be hard to do, so I suggest that you slowly eliminate it by mixing decaffeinated coffee with your regular coffee and gradually reduce the amount of caffeine you take in each day over a period of several weeks.\" Agree involves helping the patient set his or her own behaviorally specific personal action plan. Personal action plans should very specific, e.g., taking medication regularly, regular exercise, meditating, etc. It is also important that the personal action plans be patient-centered and not prescribed by the doctor. Here is an example of patient-centered personal action planning, \"Since it is so hard to take the medication regularly, I wonder if you want to make any plans now about how to take your medication?\" Assist refers to helping patients' develop solutions to barriers that interfere with personal action plans, such as barriers to medication adherence or lifestyle interventions (e.g. cost, discomfort, side-effects of medications, or difficulty sticking ). The physician can assist the patient problem-solve by inviting creating brain-storming: \"It sounds like you are having trouble with starting your meditation practice. What changes could you make that might make it easier to schedule your meditation practice once or twice a week?\" Arrange refers to ensuring follow-up arrangements that are tailored to the patient's specific needs. \"Why don't you come back in one month, so we can check on how you are feeling and how you've been able to do with your action plan of taking medication regularly and practicing your meditation at least once or twice a week?\" | | Steven Locke, MD, is the Physician in this video |CONCLUSION| | | This module reviews the special challenges of communicating with anxious patients. Physicians need special skills to assess and manage anxiety disorders in the general medical setting. Anxiety disorders are disruptive, painful, and serious medical conditions that contribute to poor work performance and often lead to substance abuse. Yet, anxiety disorders are treatable conditions and physicians who develop the communication skills to meet these communication challenges make positive contributions to their patients' lives. In addition, physicians who treat anxiety successfully will also enjoy the professional gratification that comes from helping patients feel better, improve their quality of life and their general medical prognosis. |RELEVANT BEHAVIORS| |LITERATURE REFERENCES and ADDITIONAL RESOURCES| |Welcome to doc.com Module 27: | Communicating with Depressed Patients |by Steven Cole, M.D. | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | Steven Cole, MD |The Patient's View| |The Principles:| |Learning goals:| |INTRODUCTION| | | Many mistaken beliefs limit diagnosis and treatment of major depression, a common illness. Specific communication skills help physicians to overcome the typical barriers, and to facilitate their patients' short-term and long-term management and healing of depressive illnesses. The illness of depression and its variants are common in society, and more common in people who are seeking medical care, but the diagnosis is frequently overlooked. Social stigma and negative attitudes limit the insight, interest and ability of both patients and physicians to discover depression. Patients with depression often complain of physical symptoms and physicians frequently fail to connect these somatic problems with other clues to establish the correct diagnosis. Treatment of depression is effective, and many patients go unnecessarily untreated, continuing to suffer, miss work and cause distress in friends and families. This module presents basic concepts as well as special communication challenges, and focuses on strategies and skills that will assist patients to become more comfortable discussing symptoms and more likely to accept the diagnosis and treatment of depression. |MULTIPLE MEANINGS OF \"DEPRESSION\"| | | \"Depression\" can mean either the feeling of \"sadness\" or a serious illness. Misunderstanding and carelessness in using \"depression\" leads to misdiagnosis and substandard care. The term \"depression\" has at least two related, but distinct meanings. On the one hand, the word \"depression\" refers to an affect, a feeling state, which can be brief or long lasting. A synonym for depressed affect would be \"sad.\" Another use of the term, however, refers to a clinically significant medical illness that has specific signs, symptoms, and treatments. There are several different depressive syndromes major depression, dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood. Major depression is an illness and disease state, characterized by dysregulation of various neurotransmitters in selected areas of the brain, associated with genetic predispositions, a variety of personality variables, early life history, and current stressors. In both the lay public and within the medical context, the word depression is used in both ways a circumstance leading to confusion among both clinicians and patients. Skilled physicians have a clear understanding of the different meanings of the term, \"depression,\" and are able to utilize communication skills for both contexts. |MAJOR DEPRESSION| | | The illness of depression has both psychological and physical symptoms. Major depression is the core depressive syndrome. Two cardinal signs/symptoms--depressed affect and anhedonia (lack of the ability to experience pleasure)--characterize major depression, along with 7 other symptoms, 4 physical and 3 psychological. Four physical ones are sleep disturbance, appetite/weight disturbance, fatigue or loss of energy, and psychomotor agitation or retardation. Three psychological ones are poor concentration, low self-esteem or guilt, and thoughts of death or suicidal ideation. The two cardinal symptoms along with the two other groups of symptoms, (physical and psychological), are often considered the four hallmarks of major depression. In addition, irritability is not one of the \"diagnostic\" symptoms of depression, but irritability is common in major depression and dysthymia, and clinicians should ask about it. Patients with relatively persistent depressed mood or anhedonia for at least two weeks, along with a total of any 5 of the 9 symptoms listed above meet criteria for the diagnosis of major depression. |Depression can be fatal| | | Every person experiences grief and sadness, but the illness of depression (\"clinical depression\"), with its persistent symptoms, has high morbidity and mortality. Clinicians and patients should not confuse the presence of depressed affect (sadness) with the clinical syndrome of major depression for several important reasons. First, depressed affect is a universal and unavoidable part of the human condition. However, regardless of circumstances, it is distinctly abnormal for all-encompassing, painful, and debilitating sad affect to persist day after day, week after week, and month after month. In major depression, such a persistent sad affect often accompanies anhedonia and the other physical and psychological symptoms described above. Secondly, major depression is a serious medical disorder with many negative health consequences, even death. Depression is associated with suicide, and depression predicts future coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease as well as increased morbidity and mortality of many other physical conditions. For example, the myocardial infarction patient who suffers from major depression after the heart attack is 2-3 times more likely to die in the next few years than patients without depression. About 20% of heart attack patients suffer from major depression.(1) Finally, major depression is usually treatable and reversible. |Distinguish depression from grief| | | Grief can be devastating, but it is limited to the feeling of sadness and it is transient. People with depressive illness develop symptoms in addition to sadness, and the symptoms persist over time. When people suffer a loss, a grief response is normal, and sadness is a major component of that grief. Note that grief can follow any kind of loss, not only the death of a loved one. People grieve after the break up of a love relationship. They grieve after losing a job, losing a limb, or loss of capacities from other illnesses, such as loss of ability to play tennis after a back injury. A person may grieve having to give up a stressful job or stressful lifestyle after a heart attack. People may even grieve after losing something they never had as when one realizes he will never achieve a dearly held dream. Grief often has a natural history, including periods of denial, anger, and sadness. Depending on personality, gender and the severity of the loss, most people are through the worst suffering in months and return to baseline in 6 -12 months, though some sadness and longing may last for years. Clinicians commonly think, \"Of course she's depressed, look at what she lost;\" however, the sadness accompanying grief is normal, while the sadness of depression signals an illness. People who are grieving certainly feel sad, but do not experience all the other hallmarks of depression such as low self esteem, guilt, suicidal thoughts, loss of appetite, poor sleep, and fatigue. Sometimes grief triggers a depressive illness, and when it does, the illness needs treatment.(1,2) |Respond to tears| | | Witnessing the suffering indicated by tears stands as a fundamental component of the mission of medicine. Skilled and compassionate responses to crying facilitate efficient and effective medical care. The sadness in patients' lives as well as the sadness of chronic or serious illness is an inescapable part of medical practice. Patients commonly cry in the doctors' office. Some physicians think that patient tearfulness distracts from the \"real\" work of medicine, but nothing could be further from the truth. Physicians who take their mission to relieve patient suffering seriously will strive to mindfully attend to the distress of the patient who is sad, and assist in relieving it as skillfully as possible. In general, as a window into the patient's soul, tearfulness becomes a unique opportunity to understand the patient and to build a strong alliance. In fact, it is often a good sign when a patient cries. First, it usually means you have gained the patient's trust, as patients generally do not cry in the presence of a physician he or she does not trust. Second, tears usually accompany the discussion of an important life issue which you must help the patient address. Third, the tears may be an important signal to the presence of a depressive illness. Tearfulness seldom interferes with the other work of a visit, and most patients will cry for less than a minute, often apologizing and saying that they did not want to cry in your office. As you come to understand the thoughts that provoke sadness and tears, you gain an invaluable insight into the patient. Your empathic response begins the process of improving your understanding, and builds a solid therapeutic and working alliance that improves health outcomes. | | Once a patient begins to tear up, or starts to cry, a simple reflective or caring comment is facilitative, shows your concern and encourages the patient to say more: \"I'm so sorry\" or, \"I can see this is very hard for you.\" After a few brief sentences from the patient, you may already understand enough about the situation to make a meaningful legitimating (empathic) statement, such as, \"Anyone would be distressed in this type of situation. I am sure I would be quite upset if I were in this situation also.\" |NEGATIVE ATTITUDES| | | Negative attitudes about sadness and mental illness are common, and negative responses to them can seriously undermine the physician-patient relationship. Ultimately, they impair physicians' clinical effectiveness. Many patients and physicians have had emotionally charged personal experiences with depression that shape their current attitudes. They may have had a depressed parent or relative whom they could never please or help; a depressed parent who was always angry, depriving or even abusive; or perhaps a depressed parent who helped cultivate a profound sense of responsibility for caretaking of others. Conversely, many physicians have experienced depression themselves or have had a depressed spouse or child with depression. With the strong cultural emphasis on independence and achievement, depressed individuals may feel guilty or distressed because they lack energy to be self-sufficient and productive, thinking they should be able to \"pull themselves up by their bootstraps.\" These factors contribute to the widespread notion that mental illness, including depression, is a form of moral weakness or failure. Like their patients, physicians may also hold these negative, stigmatizing attitudes toward depression. Unfortunately, medical trainees and practicing physicians themselves suffer from high rates of incident and chronic depression. Patients commonly explain away depressed feelings as \"understandable\" or \"normal\" under stressful circumstances. They deny to themselves and others that they may be suffering from clinically significant depression, often thinking or saying that they have \"good reasons\" to feel sad under the circumstances. If they are grieving a loss, they may mistake a new clinically significant depression for a normal grief reaction. Consider your personal experiences with depression and reflect on how those experiences have shaped your attitudes. You might have difficulty connecting emotionally with patients who have a depressed affect, or you may worry about \"making\" patients cry. Many medical trainees are overly cautious about asking about emotional topics, or worry about \"prying\" into the causes of a patient's sadness. Such concerns are common and normal, but can seriously impair your clinical effectiveness. Exploring your own attitudes and coming to terms with those which could hinder your effectiveness, will enable you to view depressive illnesses more positively and to care for depressed patients with skill and empathy. |ESTABLISH A DIAGNOSIS| | | Patients often conceal their sadness or do not complain of sadness. Few physicians employ screening strategies routinely. The rapid pace of medical practice may impede diagnosis of depression. Depression is common among medical patients. In disadvantaged populations the prevalence may exceed 30%, which argues for vigilance and frequent screening. Some clinicians and researchers argue that every patient should be assessed for depression at every visit, but we believe targeting screening assessments to patients at high risk for depression represents a more efficient and pragmatic strategy. High risk patients have been shown by research to include those with chronic illnesses (diabetes, heart failure, etc), patients with recurrent unexplained physical symptoms such as pain, fatigue, neurological symptoms, etc, and patients undergoing life transitions or unusual stress. Too few general physicians discover their patients' depressive illnesses. Studies show that in primary care practice, about half of patients with depression do not receive a proper diagnosis. Many factors contribute to this problem. Patients with depression often appear to have normal affect often make a very conscious effort to hide their sad feelings. Patients seldom complain directly of depression. Physicians can uncover hidden depression with screening strategies, but few clinicians routinely screen patients for depression. Medical practice today suffers from compelling time constraints, and physicians may focus their attention on other acute and chronic medical problems that demand immediate attention. |Ask about sadness and other symptoms| | | Ask direct questions about sadness, and follow up with further open-ended inquiry. Eliciting the symptoms of depressive illness can be very straightforward. However, physicians should practice with mindfulness of the high prevalence of depressive disorders and attention to overcoming their own internal reluctance or hesitation about working with patients' sad affect. Finally, physicians must remember to ask directly about depressed affect, anhedonia and other symptoms. Effective opening questions are simple. For example: |\"Have you been feeling sad, blue, down in the dumps?\" | \"Have you noticed that you don't enjoy things as much as you used to?\" If the patient responds positively to either one, proceed with further open-ended interventions, saying something like: | | \"Could you tell me a little more about your feelings of sadness or your loss of enjoyment?\" Remember to respond actively and compassionately to patients' verbal and non-verbal expression of emotions. |Attend to non-verbal signals| | | Non-verbal signs can alert physicians to possible depressive illness and avoid ineffectual pursuit of somatic symptoms. Many patients with depression who conceal their sadness emphasize somatic symptoms such as insomnia and poor appetite or lack of energy. This distracts physicians, who may focus on the characteristics of symptoms and order endocrine, cardiac or other work-ups that are expensive, time consuming and ultimately fruitless. However, patients often display non-verbal and para-verbal hints of underlying depression, and alert clinicians notice these signals, comment on them and follow up.(m14) Patients may look down when speaking, sigh frequently, or take in a breath as though they were going to sigh and then speak instead, with a breathy quality to their voices. They may reach for their eyes or dab at them, though there are no tears, or their eyes may start to glisten, as though they might cry. They might make helplessness gestures (a shrug of the shoulders, an upturned hand gesture followed by the hand dropping to the lap or table). Their voices may trail off by the end of a sentence, or have a \"flat\" quality. Some will show an anxious affect or other signs of anxiety, which often accompanies depressive illness. Another hint is your own affect. If you suddenly feel sad about or sorry for the patient, it is often related to the patient's sad affect. If you notice any of these, and simply say to the patient, \"you seem sad to me,\" followed by silence, the patient will often start to cry. |Stigma produces conflict| |Because of the stigma attached to depression, patients and physicians too easily attribute symptoms to \"stress.\" Responding supportively is possible.| Substantial social stigma concerning all mental illness (including depression) exists in the public today, and as a result, many patients are embarrassed to disclose depressed affect or may simply deny its presence. This can create a head-to-head conflict between doctor and patient. For example, the patient with chronic illness, physical complications, and significant life stress may have trouble sleeping, have trouble with energy and trouble with fatigue. When asked, \"Are you depressed?\" the patient may respond by saying something like, \"Of course I'm depressed doctor, who wouldn't be depressed, with all these physical problems and all the stress I am under!\" How can you respond to this challenge? It is helpful to reassure the patient and support his or her defense, while also encouraging a different perspective. Responses like the following are often helpful: |\"Many people would feel exactly like you feel. The kind of problems and stresses you have been having would certainly be upsetting for almost everyone. But I also wonder whether you might be suffering from a kind of chemical imbalance that is now making it even harder for you to feel OK and harder for you to function. If so, treatment can really help.\"| Busy, rushed physicians occasionally invoke their medical \"authority\" when challenged by patients who deny depression. When challenged in this way by patients who are responding to the stigma, physicians not uncommonly turn to defensive, distancing, un-facilitative and counter-productive responses , and say something like, \"Well, I do think you're depressed even if you are not aware of it.\" Do not say anything like this! Try a simple empathic statement such as, \"Seems we are not quite on the same page; ...I hope I can find a way to be helpful to you.\" |Getting around denial| | | Asking about symptoms other than depression or sadness is a reasonable way to engage patients and avoid potentially troublesome denial and unnecessary conflict. Denial of depression is a troubling patient response, and a frank denial discourages compassionate responses from physicians and invites difficulty in the doctor-patient relationship. When asked a question about depression, the patient may simply state, \"I am not depressed.\" How can you respond to that, if other symptoms seem to point to depression? When the skilled physician realizes that the patient may deny depressed affect or clinical depression, he or she will strategically avoid or postpone direct questions about depressed affect, especially in the earlier phases of the interview. Inquiry about anhedonia is less threatening than talk about depressed affect. Instead of addressing depressed affect, it may be more judicious to begin with a question about anhedonia, such as, |\"I have been wondering if you've been enjoying life lately?\" or | \"I wonder what you've been doing for fun these days.\" If the patient acknowledges anhedonia and at least four of the other nine symptoms of depression, the patient meets criteria for major depression even without acknowledging or counting depressed affect as one of the nine symptoms of clinical depression. For the purposes of diagnosis, then, the patient's response to inquiry concerning depressed affect is actually not pivotal to the diagnosis of major depression. |ASSESS SUICIDE POTENTIAL| | | Ask each patient with depression about suicide, and be certain to know the 5 key questions that help assess suicidality. Every patient with depression should be considered a potential suicide risk and needs evaluation. Suicide assessment usually begins with a broad question about hopelessness, such as, \"Do you sometimes feel that life is not worth living anymore?\" The patient who answers positively to this question is said to have \"passive\" suicide ideation. Continue the interview to determine whether or not the patient also has active suicidal ideation. If the patient responds positively, follow-up with an open-ended question like, \"Can you say some more about this?\" Five follow-up questions comprise the basic and essential suicide evaluation in the primary care sector. If the patient does not reveal answers in response to an open-ended question (above), these five questions should be asked directly: The patient who claims he or she will contact the physician or an emergency room is said to be able to \"contract for safety.\" Contracting for safety is a useful intervention, but little research evidence supports its use. Thus, the ability or willingness to contract for safety may be a modest clinical measure of suicide risk, but you cannot use this guideline mindlessly. Patients who answer \"yes\" to questions 1 or 2 should be considered moderate suicide risks, while any patient who responds positively to questions 3, 4 or 5 should be viewed as a high suicide risk, and requires immediate action, for example referral to a psychiatrist. |PRESENTING THE DIAGNOSIS| | | After establishing the presence of clinical depression and evaluating for suicide, share your thoughts with the patient, and address stigma and barrier health beliefs. Tell patients they have depression, but do not discount the primacy of their somatic symptoms and the effects of denial and stigma. Telling patients you think they have clinical depression can be a challenge. Many patients with depression come to the primary care doctor's office with chief complaints relating to physical symptoms like pain, fatigue and insomnia. They do not experience their problems as depressive in origin, so they are understandably concerned if doctors attempt to \"explain away\" their symptoms as caused by a depression. Do not get caught in the trap of discounting physical symptoms in the effort to properly diagnose and treat depression. Maintain a two-armed or multidimensional approach: treat the physical symptoms with respect and concern, evaluate them and treat them conservatively and responsively. However, also treat the depressive syndrome as an independent cause of suffering and disability. For example, the patient with stomach discomfort and a clinically significant depressive syndrome should be managed with the two-armed multidimensional approach, such as: |\"I understand the stomach pain is a problem. We want to do a few more tests and I am prescribing a medication that should lower your production of acid. And I would also like you to consider treatment for another condition I think you are suffering from: clinical depression \"| |Address barrier health beliefs| | | Ask what the patient knows or feels about depression, and counter the belief that depression is a \"weakness\" by separating characteristics like \"strength\" from illness. Stigma about mental illness and depression serves as both the cause and result of \"barrier\" health beliefs. The most important barrier health belief is the notion that depression is a sign of weakness. This belief imposes a barrier that discourages a treatment alliance between doctor and patient. Physicians can recognize the presence of a barrier health belief and address it straightforwardly. The only sure way to recognize the presence of a barrier health belief is to ask, |\"I think you have some clinical depression What do you know about depression? How do you feel about the diagnosis of depression?\" | The patient's answers will uncover health beliefs that can profoundly affect a working alliance with the patient. If the patient says something like, \"Only weak people get depressed,\" you now have some insight into factors that may lead to non-adherence and have an opportunity to respond directly to the patient's concerns. The physician can then say something like, |\"I understand how you might feel this way, and many people have the same feelings. It is important for you to know that anyone can get caught up in depression and it has nothing to do with a person's strengths or weaknesses.\"| |Share information about depression| | | Considerable research points to structured strategic steps that ultimately help patients understand the illness, construct a manageable treatment plan, and adhere to it. The first step requires elicitation of the patient's beliefs and perspectives, followed by the provision of small amounts of information directed at those beliefs, followed by a check for understanding. Effective education about depression begins at the same time that the physician first presents the diagnosis to the patient. Good care necessitates understanding the patient's knowledge and perspective, with a question like, \"What is your understanding of depression?\" After the patient answers this question, you can respond to the patient's emotional and cognitive concerns, and then offer short, concrete, clear statements explaining the condition. Sometimes physicians try to \"educate\" their patients with long monologues that are poorly understood and poorly attended to. Patients become confused and overwhelmed with long explanations. On the other hand, physicians who pause after providing short educational messages find that patients often understand better and reply with statements and questions that facilitate emotionally relevant as well as efficient and effective information transfer.(m9,10) | | \"While everyone gets sad once in a while and particularly when bad things happen, clinical depression is a different story. Clinical depression has a persistent sadness and loss of enjoyment that is related to chemical imbalances in the brain that also cause poor sleep, low energy, slow movements, change in appetite, poor concentration, low self-esteem or guilt, and hopelessness The good news is that the condition is treatable We usually prescribe either antidepressants and/or counseling... I think you owe it to yourself to consider one or both of these treatments. You deserve to feel better. What do you think are you willing to consider treatment for your depression?\" Some clinicians compare depression to other chronic illnesses with chemical deficiencies, such as hypothyroidism or diabetes. | | \"Depression is a deficiency syndrome like diabetes. If you don't have enough insulin coming from your pancreas, your sugar goes up. In depression there is a deficiency of serotonin, a chemical in your brain that you need to have a normal mood. If you don't have enough serotonin being produced in certain parts of your brain, it affects how you think and feel; you will have a low mood.\" |NEGOTIATE TREATMENT PLANS| | | Getting treatment at some time is more important than insisting that treatment begin today. Offer choices, including \"non-medical\" ones like exercise and socializing. Support autonomy and involvement, and assist the patient in developing a long-term plan for self-management. Because many patients will resist accepting the diagnosis of depression or resist starting treatment, either counseling or medication, an open-minded attitude of flexible negotiation to the encounter is helpful. Offering choices supports patients' sense of autonomy and involvement with planning, and increases adherence to the treatment selected. |\"You have a clinical depression that usually responds very well to treatment. There are different treatments available. Depression responds to treatment with medication. And depression also responds to treatment with counseling. Some people prefer treatment with both medication and counseling, which is often the most powerful treatment. My personal recommendation for you now is that you consider treatment with both medication and counseling. Would you be interested in these treatments?\"| Patients who refuse treatment initially may agree to treatment at a later point in time. Always leave the door open to future treatment. Inviting significant others into the discussion can also be helpful. You could say something like, |\"I understand that you are not willing to start treatment now. I would like you to think some more about what I have said, perhaps talk to your husband (or wife, or parents, etc) and even bring him (or her or them) to your next appointment. We will watch you closely and see how you feel at your next appointment in say, two or three weeks.\"| Other strategies can help. Prescribing daily aerobic exercise helps alleviate the symptoms of depression. Encouraging patients to renew ties to friends, community, and places of worship can help relieve the isolation of depression and enhance social support. |\"You haven't been going to church since your symptoms began a few months ago - I remember you used to be a regular church-goer and enjoyed volunteering at church suppers and the like. It will really help you feel better if you try to get back to the things you used to enjoy. I think it would be a good idea for you to consider starting to go to church again. Perhaps you would consider going this Sunday? What do you think of that idea?| |Support self-management| | | Patients benefit from physicians' strategic facilitation of their personal short-term and long-term plans to manage the behaviors that influence their health. Depression is a chronic, recurring illness. Like patients with other chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and heart failure, patients with depression who can learn about the illness and accept the responsibility for self-management have the best quality of life and the best long-term outcomes. You can help your patient with chronic illness by supporting their own goal-setting and problem-solving. Evidence-based techniques that physicians can use to support self-management are contained in the framework of the \"5A's: assess, advise, agree, assist, and arrange.\" (m16, 24, 25) Another useful framework for encouraging self-management is UB-PAP. Ultra-Brief Personal Action Planning : (UB-PAP) \u00a9 The Ultra-Brief Personal Action Plan has 5 core elements: The Ultra-Brief Personal Action Planning is structured around 3 core questions: 1. Elicit patient preferences/desires for behavior change \"Is there anything you would like to do that will help you feel better over the next few days (weeks) before I see you again?\" ___ What? ___ Where? ___ When? ___ How often? ___ Elicit commitment statement (e.g. \"I will walk for 20 minutes, in my neighborhood, every Monday, Wednesday and Friday before dinner\") 2. Check confidence level \"That sounds like a great plan. But changing behavior and sticking with a plan is actually very hard for most of us. If you consider a confidence scale of 1 to 10, where '10' means you are very confident you will carry out the plan and '1' means you are not at all confident, about how confident are you?\" If confidence level <7, problem solve solution \"That's great that you feel a confidence level of 5. That's a lot higher than 1. I wonder if there are some ways we could modify the plan so you might get to a confidence level of 7 or more. Perhaps you could choose a less ambitious goal, ask for help from a friend or family member, or think of something else that might help you feel more confident about carrying out the plan\"? 3. Arrange follow-up \"Great, so let's make a date for our next appointment, so we can check on how you're doing with your plan.\" |CONCLUSION| | | Because depression is such a painful, serious, but treatable condition, physicians who develop the communication skills to meet these challenges will make positive contributions to their patients' lives. This module reviewed the special challenges of communicating with depressed patients. Physicians need special skills to meet the many challenges of depression assessment and depression management in the general medical setting. In addition, physicians who treat depression successfully will also feel the professional gratification that comes from helping patients feel better, from enhancing their quality of life and from improving their general medical prognosis. |BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST| |REFERENCES| |ADDITIONAL MD | \u00a9 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | for Reflection:| You are evaluating a woman with multiple complaints. Ten minutes into your exam, there's a knock at the door. It is her companion gently asking if everything is okay and reminding her that he'll be in the waiting room if she needs anything. Even though the interruption is minimal, you notice a slight change in your patient: she becomes distracted and looks away more. You ask her about this relationship; she remarks that he's very good to her in that he takes her to her appointments, makes sure she is never alone, and guides her as to how to do things. Only after you persistently question her, she slowly and hesitatingly cries. At the same time, she repeatedly asserts that he \"takes care of me and teaches me how to do things correctly.\" |Key Principles:| |Learning goals:| |PREVALENCE| | | Domestic Violence is serious and widespread. It cuts across all socioeconomic groups, cultures, ages, and gender identities. A random sample of women aged 18-46 from three public hospital primary care clinics (n=734) who were questioned about their history of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse reported a 15% prevalence of recent (within the last 12 months) abuse by an intimate partner and a lifetime prevalence of 51% (1). This is similar to other studies: a self-reported survey presented to all adult women seeking care from a family practice clinic in the Midwest (n=394) showed a 22.7% prevalence of physical assault by their partners within the last year and a lifetime rate of 38.8% (2); another self-administered survey of all patients randomly presenting to three university-affiliated internal medicine clinics in California (n=453) indicated a 14% rate of current domestic violence and a 28% lifetime rate (3). Looking at medical records of all female trauma patients presenting to an emergency department, McLeer and Anwar (4) found a 30% incidence of battery leading to their presenting symptoms. Another study of female adolescents (n=4163) found that 1 in 5 female students reported being physically and/or sexually abused by a dating partner (5). Globally, according to a study by the World Health Organization looking at women in ten countries, domestic violence is the most common form of violence against women ( [http://www.who.int/en](http://www.who.int/en)). Unfortunately, abuse does not have boundaries. A self-reported, anonymous survey of 521 adolescents at a gay, lesbian, bisexual (GLB) youth rally found the prevalence of dating violence among GLB adolescents to be similar to that of heterosexuals. (6) On the other hand, a nationally representative telephone survey asking about lifetime experiences with domestic violence comparing same-sex cohabitation with opposite-sex cohabitation found a higher prevalence among same-sex cohabitants and specifically among gay male couples. (7) Another national sample of 283 gays and lesbians found that 47.5% of lesbians and 29.7% of gays have been victimized by their same-sex partner. (8) In this module, because the majority of abuse victims are women, we will focus on them, remembering though that either gender can be victims of abuse. When abuse occurs during pregnancy, it could have two victims. A random sample of pregnant women from two public prenatal clinics in Texas and Maryland (n=1203) found a prevalence of 16% physical and sexual abuse during the pregnancy.(9) Another self-reported survey of 6143 women in South Carolina (population-based data) noted an 11.1% prevalence of physical abuse during their pregnancy. (10) |RAMIFICATIONS OF VIOLENCE| | | Violence does not involve just your patient; it involves the whole family and has implications for the future. It is important to diagnose abuse. When undiagnosed, patients continue to suffer, and may lose their lives. A patient experiencing violence does not always come to you with a physical injury; rather, they often present with physical or psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, somatization, loss of appetite, pelvic or abdominal pain, headaches, diarrhea, and problems sleeping.(11) Furthermore, victims of abuse have an increased risk of depression compared to women without partner abuse (1), and are at increased risk of substance abuse and suicide (12). There are ramifications beyond individual suffering, including child abuse concomitant with spousal abuse, and the potential to produce a cycle of violence in later generations (13). When violence occurs during pregnancy, the effects can be even more pronounced, such as the risk of preterm delivery (14), risk of delivery by cesarean, hospitalization for complications (10), or deleterious coping mechanisms.(9) DV is costly. One study revealed that a large health plan spent about $2000 more per patient for victims of abuse as they had more hospitalizations, general clinic use, mental health services, and referrals (15). In another study in which residents evaluated standardized patients for various clinical scenarios, half of the residents ordered unnecessary tests to evaluate the patient who was being abused. Furthermore, residents who did not diagnose DV spent nearly twice as much per patient on work-up compared to those who diagnosed DV (16). |UNDERRECOGNITION OF DV| | | Domestic Violence is often unrecognized in general practice, emergency centers and in hospital settings. When it is recognized, physicians often do not respond effectively. We tested 71 residents in a multi-station standardized patient exercise where one station depicted a scenario common to abuse victimsa woman presenting with chronic headaches, who, if asked appropriate questions, would admit to having an abusive partner. Forty (56%) residents correctly diagnosed DV. Still, the majority gave inappropriate (even dangerous) treatment recommendations (16). There are many reasons for under-recognition of DV. Many clinicians do not screen for abuse, or do not have a high index of suspicion. Many clinicians are uncomfortable asking questions about abuse. Many fear that if they ask about abuse, they won't know how to respond. On the patients' side, abused women are often embarrassed or ashamed by the abuse and will not readily admit the abuse to their practitioners. They often present with a variety of somatic symptoms, and physicians can often get sidetracked working these up. Many women are afraid to admit the abuse: they may have been threatened with even more violence if they reveal the abuse to anyone. Many are ambivalent about their relationships with their abusers, hoping that things will turn around; some feel that they are at fault or are bad, or deserve the abuse. Many women have concomitant mental health problems, such as depression or alcohol abuse, that cause their own problems and may distract from the diagnosis of abuse. To admit abuse, a patient must feel completely trusting of clinician, feel that there is time to talk about it, and that the clinician cares. |SCREENING FOR DV| | | In 1992, The American Medical Association recommended \"to routinely screen for victimizationincluding intimate physical and sexual assaultin their initial and ongoing assessments \"(17). Routine screening for DV is infrequent (10%-25%), even in states where screening is mandatory (18, 19). Yet, physicians believe it is part of their role to assist victims of DV (20). It is important to ask about abuse directly. Many women who are being abused feel a good deal of guilt, shame and fear about their situations, and will be very reluctant to disclose. It is often helpful to \"normalize\" domestic violence in the history taking by including it in your psychosocial history questions. Or you can ask about abuse while asking about other safety questions, like asking about seat belts or weapons (21). You can present the question as such: \" I see many patients who are dealing with abusive relationships. Some are too uncomfortable to bring it up so I ask about it routinely. Are you involved with someone who physically or emotionally hurts you?\" (22). \"Who do you live with? How do you get along? How do you/your partner manage your anger? Do you ever have physical fights?\" As discussed earlier, many women may be reluctant to admit the abuse; don't expect victims to immediately open up to you. If a patient seem hesitant, or equivocal, or looks down when she answers, or changes the subject, or says something like, \"I'm just trying to be a good wife,\" you can gently encourage her: \"It sounds like it's hard for you to talk about this.\" If she nods in assent, you can reassure her of confidentiality, and your willingness to listen. Stay silent to give her a chance to gather her courage to respond. Beyond routine screening, suspect abuse when women present with symptoms that seem stress related, such as headaches, muscle aches, fatigue or if they have multiple somatic complaints with negative work-ups for organic causes. Your role is not just diagnosis, but more importantly, your role is to provide \"information, support, and a safe environment\" for discussion whenever the patient is ready (23). |WHAT DO YOU ASK ABOUT ONCE THE PATIENT DISCLOSES VIOLENCE?| | | It is important to understand something about the patient's background and the development of the abusive relationship, before you can begin to make suggestions. Ask, \"Can you tell me something about your life, what your childhood was like, how you got into this kind of relationship? Tell me something about your partner.\" Many abused women grow up in abusive homes. As children many have witnessed violence against their mothers and are often victims of physical and emotional abuse themselves. Often a parent is an alcoholic. Ask, \"Many women who are victims of domestic violence have experienced sexual or physical abuse growing up. Has that happened to you?\" As children trying to make sense of their lives, they assume that they are being punished because they are bad. They grow up with the sense that they are bad, that they are undeserving, not good enough, not intrinsically lovable, that life is uncontrollable. They grow up expecting to be rejected and hurt. Many fall victim to the common psychological defense of \"repetition compulsion.\" They run away from home at an early age to be with a man that they think will treat them with respect. They may know that there may be problems with the relationship but feel that if they love the new partner enough, they can reform him. Too often, these partners become abusers. Their sense of lack of choice is compounded by their ambivalence and confusion. Abusers often take their victims through a cycle of violence-honeymoon where immediately after an outburst of violence, the abuser apologizes and is extremely caring towards the victim. This may last for some time; then the pattern of abuse gradually escalates. Abused women feel that their partner loves them, and needs them, and they often have strong feelings of love and need as well. After the apology the victims start to hope again and positive feelings may resurface. When the abuse recurs, all of the negative feelings about self, the sense of helplessness, and the positive feelings for the abuser all combine to paralyze the victim's will. They see no way out. Also, practically, they may have few choices. They are often financially dependent on the abuser, have children in school, few social and family resources, and feel if they leave they will have nowhere to turn. Reading narratives written by survivors of abuse can give you insight into the worlds of abuse victims. |Key Questions| | | There are other key questions you must ask once you learn about abuse. Ask about her thoughts and feelings, and any plans. It is important to understand your patient's reactions to her situation. She may blame herself or feel she deserves the abuse. She may be desperate but sees no way out. She may have thought about leaving in a tentative way, or she may have decided to do so but needs help. Ask gently about what she thinks and feels about her situation and about any plans she may have made. Ask about safety. First, assess if she is in immediate danger once she leaves your office. Has the pattern of abuse escalated lately? How severe have been the physical injuries? Has she had to go to the ER? If the abuse has not escalated, ask about the possibility of serious abuse in the future, i.e., does the abuser have a weapon? Ask about child abuse. Ask if anyone else is being maltreated--as children often witness abuse or are victims themselves. If there is concomitant child abuse, you have a legal obligation to report this. Ask about mood. Depression and suicidal ideation is common among victims of abuse (1, 12). Depression can paralyze the victim's will, and make her situation seem more hopeless than it is. Adequate treatment of depression often enables the victim to think more clearly, improves her self-esteem, and lessens her tolerance of abuse. If you are referring her to a therapist, be sure to cite abuse as a reason, for a possible stigma of mental incapacity may be used by the abuser in custody battles later. Ask about substance abuse. Many women will try to escape the pain of abuse by turning to drugs or alcohol. Substance use and abuse only complicates the situation and keeps her trapped. If she is abusing substances she will need treatment for that problem as well as her abuse. |WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY ONCE THE PATIENT DISCLOSES VIOLENCE?| | | It is important to say several things: 1. \"This is wrong.\" The personal and emotional history of DV victims often instills the errant belief that abuse is what life has to offer for them. Your strong statement, \"This is wrong. No one has the right to put a hand to you, no matter what!\" can shake the abused woman's world, and be the beginning of her thinking differently. Empower the victim by telling her she does not deserve such treatment. It is important not to seem like you are scolding her (\"Why do you stay with him?\") (22) 2. \"It's not your fault.\" Too often, abused women blame themselves for the abuse, saying things like, \"I should have had his dinner ready on time. It is the least I can do he works so hard.\" \"If only I were a better wife, things would be different.\" The abusers often shift the blame onto the victim and make verbally abusive statements about the victim's worthlessness. You must reinforce the notion that abuse is not the victims' fault. \"Please don't blame yourself. Nothing about this is your fault. Nothing you do should provoke him to hit you.\" 3. \"You are not alone.\" Abused women feel isolated and alone. This is frequently reinforced by the abuser, who has over time systematically worked to cut off contacts with the victim's family and friends. Let the patient know that domestic abuse is all too common, and that there is a good deal of support available in the community. Let her know that you will be available to work with her to help her to make choices for her life. 4. \"You have a choice.\" Women in abusive situations often feel trapped. They see themselves as victims of fate without choices. The great insight that allows them to begin the first steps away from being a victim of abuse to being a survivor starts when they realize that they actually have choices in their lives. You can help them come to that realization: \"You don't have to live like this. You can choose another course. There are hard choices, but there are choices, and you can make them. What have you thought about?\" |COUNSELING| | | Urge the patient to seek counseling. Arrange for counseling immediately if needed. Do not tell her to leave. If it seems too dangerous to return home today, you must actively intervene and ask if she would be willing to see a counselor immediately. Many hospitals and communities have such counselors available, and it is imperative for you to know of these resources. Make a statement of concern: \"I admire your courage in telling me all this. From what you've told me about your husband's recent behavior and his threats, I'm really worried about your going home today. Would it be ok if I called a domestic violence counselor who you could see immediately?\" If immediate danger is ruled out, referring patients for counseling is the core of DV management (24). Make small educational brochures with emergency numbers of counselors, hotlines, and shelters available in your room and in your women's bathroom. Thus, the patient can discreetly read and carry these small cards on her. Tell the patient about specific resources and people she can call as soon as she feels safe to do so. Once referred, the counselor will then assess further safety issues and educate her about her options. While it is reasonable to ask the patient if she has thought about leaving the abuser, it is ill-advised to recommend that she leaves, for many reasons. The first is that women start the healing process by realizing they have a choice. They are used to following orders from an authority figure. If you tell a woman to leave, she might just do so because you said it, which could precipitate a crisis in her life and endanger her. It is important to remember that leaving is the most dangerous time for a victim of abuse. Also, if she leaves precipitously, she may have limited choices and financial support. Some women suddenly become homeless when they leave. To succeed, she must plan carefully. If she asks your advice about leaving and wants to plan to do so, educate her to plan ahead: set aside some money regularly, copy all important records, disclose the abuse to family and friends in order to gain support and identify where she can stay once she leaves, alert company and coworkers about the existence of abuse. Remember that many women may try to leave many times before they succeed, and many women are not ready to leave yet, still hoping to salvage the relationship. If you show that you are judgmental or frustrated at a patient's unwillingness to take necessary steps, it will undermine her trust in you and your ability to help her. Another generally accepted contradiction of treatment is recommending couples counseling (24). Abusers generally become angry when they learn the victim has revealed the abuse, and the violence may escalate. Also, abusers seldom benefit from this form of counseling. [http://www.endabuse.org/resources/](http://www.endabuse.org/resources/) provides a comprehensive review of resources. |WHAT DO YOU DOCUMENT IN THE CHART?| | | The doctor's notes are often the only other evidence of abuse besides the victim's voice, as there are often no witnesses to abuse (25). Legally appropriate chart documentation could be an invaluable asset to the patient in court. The National Institute of Justice has put out a report regarding documenting domestic violence. They note the following: When examining a victim, if there are injuries, take pictures, draw body maps, and describe the stage(s) of healing. Write who committed the injury and with what instrument. Describe the facts; do not write \"patient claims or patient alleges\" as this may introduce incredulity in the courts. As always, write legibly. (26) |Legal issues| | | Make sure you are aware of your state's laws about abuse. In addition to providing general standard medical care, physicians treating victims of abuse may have legal obligations. As of March 1994, all but five states (Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, Washington, and Wyoming) have laws that to varying extents require reporting of injuries involving a weapon or a crime. As of 2001, six states (California, Colorado, Kentucky, New Hampshire, New Mexico, and Rhode Island) specifically require reporting domestic violence. Still, reporting may have varying reasons: Rhode Island requires reporting for data collection only whereas California requires reporting to the police (27). |CONCLUSION| | | Domestic Violence is widespread among women seeking medical care. It affects women's overall well-being, any children involved, and society (by increasing cost of health care). As physicians, there is much that we can do: we can help by screening for abuse, empowering and educating the victims, and referring them to specialized domestic violence counselors.

Novack, M.D. Publication in Medical Encounter; Volume 12 No.2, Spring 1996; Pages 2-6, used with Permission This text is available for printout: [LoneBearStory.pdf](../../m_28/assets/LoneBearStory.pdf) Introduction Three years ago last Thanksgiving I left my husband for the final time. When I left I have to admit I did not know I was leaving permanently. I was just escaping. But looking back I realize it was the first actual physical step I took to save my life. Now I see that events and people at the right times and places enabled me to take each needed step to make the final break. History I had been married for seven years. This was my second marriage and it was a typical domestic violent (DV) relationship with cycles of abuse and \"honeymoon\" periods. However, at the time of my final leaving there were no longer any \"honeymoon\" periods. Our marriage was mostly extended periods of silence by my husband unless he was on a tirade or other people were present. I had left many times - sometimes for a few hours, other times overnight and a couple times for several nights. A few incidents involved the county sheriffs department. But never was anyone taken away or any follow-up done. My husband was classified disabled and had a very modest monthly income. I was the full-time breadwinner. However, the \"control\" part of our relationship had progressed until my husband had full control of all our income and expenses. He drove me everywhere and the only thing I did outside of going to work was attend his son's high school athletic activities and church on Sunday. At the time of my final leaving the severe physical violence had ceased. After a severe beating early in the marriage I filed for divorce. He then knew how much physical abuse I would tolerate. After a two-month separation with promises of a Christian home (exactly what I wanted to hear) he drew me back in. This time my husband found I would tolerate pushes, being slammed against walls, squeezed, telephones ripped out, being confined, etc. I was isolated from friends and family. I was not only afraid of him, but embarrassed, confused, and by this time so dependent I just lived from day to day. Knowing this was not right but incapable of taking any action to get away, I was always walking on eggshells to keep from shattering the peace. I came to welcome his punishments of ignoring me for days at a time. We attended an exclusive-membership church in Seattle where women were not allowed to speak. There was no interaction with the church outside of Sundays. He took an active \"speaking\" role in this church. At home I was continually preached to about not being submissive enough and did not know my \"place.\" My faith in God was used effectively against me. To finish this history, I am sure you know that the control issues did not just happen overnight. It continually escalated and the more I tolerated the more I lost control of my life. At the time just prior to my actual leaving, I don't believe I was actually suicidal but I was deeply depressed. And I can honestly say I felt death probably was preferable to what my life was. My children (my only close family) had been pushed away from me. With my life far beyond my control at the time I just didn't care if I lived or died. When my husband would go somewhere, I would hope something would happen to him so he would not come home. Leaving I had outpatient arm surgery (work related) the day before Thanksgiving (holidays are crisis times in DV relationships). My husband was giving me my pain medication. I was sleeping most of the time. But I was so drugged I didn't realize it or care. Due to an allergic reaction to the pain medication (I have this problem with pain medication), I aroused enough to know I was not breathing properly and had severe itching. I asked my husband to call the surgery consulting nurse but he refused. I literally had to pull myself to the telephone in the kitchen (none in the bedroom) and call. She said to immediately call 911 for paramedics or if it was faster have my husband rush me to the hospital. I had my husband talk to her as he would not respond to my plead for help. He hung up and said he would drive me, walked out to the car and waited for me. By pulling myself along I managed to get to the car. If his actions were public he always acted in a way that protected himself, i.e., talked to the nurse, took me to the hospital. But he offered no help to me. At the hospital they treated me for a drug reaction. But the doctor asked me why there were so few pills left. I told him my husband had been giving me the medication. The doctor had my husband come in from the waiting room and asked him why he had given me so many. I can remember my husband replied \"I just thought it was better for her to sleep.\" After a few hours in the hospital I was sent home with my husband. The doctor could have been sending me home to die. When we returned home I waited until I felt \"normal\" and until my husband was not paying attention. I grabbed a few articles of clothing and walked out to the car. I managed to get in and lock the door before he came storming out. I then drove away and never went back. It has only been through DV group counseling that I have been able to admit that his intentions may not only have been to keep me quiet but to permanently silence me. A murder threat against me telephoned to my daughter and son-in-law during the time of the divorce proceedings confirmed this. Doctors Doctor A: My husband and I had the same primary care doctor. I really like him and went to him before I ever married my husband. I have since returned to this doctor as my primary care physician. But to this day we have never discussed why my marriage to Steve dissolved. During the marriage my doctor treated me for stomach and bowel problems, asthma, chronic sinus infections and chest pains. It seems like I was always going to him for something. He was treating all the symptoms and never finding out the real underlying cause of them. Whenever I needed to see the doctor, Steve always accompanied me, usually even into the exam room with me. The doctor would come in, take care of me and then start visiting with Steve. Toward the end of the relationship I was constantly being monitored by Steve. One incident I know the doctor should have followed up in private with me in some way. It was a typical doctor visit for me with Steve following me into the exam room. The doctor had completed his exam and made some comment to Steve (I do not remember what it was). But I do remember Steve replying \"Maybe I should just knock some sense into her!\" The doctor did respond that Steve should not make those kinds of statements because he might have to view it as possible abuse. Steve laughed and said he was just joking. One thing my doctor did that probably helped me escape the relationship was refer me to the medical group's women's health practitioner, Marilyn. I saw her for my yearly female exams. She not only concerned herself with women's health but with the whole picture. As soon as she saw how many medications I was taking, she said I had to take charge of my life. She recommended the stress reduction classes that were available. I did not take those classes, of course, nor was DV mentioned. But because of this initial visit and following visits, I trusted her and knew she was someone I could talk to. After I finally left Steve for good, I changed doctors. Since our doctor still was involved with Steve and his medical history, I felt it was easier for me to change, as usual putting Steve ahead of myself. During the DV training sessions I participated in someone asked me who initiated Steve's going into the exam room with me. This immediately made me feel like I was to blame even now after three years and all I have learned in DV group. However, it was an honest question and I am sure one not intended to make me feel intimidated. I remember the first time it happened. The nurse called me in and said \"Hi\" to Steve. He asked if he could come in also because he wanted to ask the doctor something. The nurse said \"sure.\" I remember it because it was one of the times I actually realized my freedom was being diminished again. A great heaviness always settled in my chest whenever some new control happened in my life. It felt like some more of me was dying. Doctor B: My new doctor was even older than I was (I will be 50 this year). I went to him for a start-up physical and even though his manner was different I had no problem with him. Looking back I realize no questions were asked on the forms or verbally about DV or related topics. During the divorce proceedings when I was being stalked, harassed and threatened (my daughter and grandson also), I landed in the hospital emergency room with a panic attack (severe chest pain). During my follow-up visit with my primary care doctor I told him exactly what had happened and the events causing the panic attack. He seemed embarrassed about it. He was very \"nice\" and as he left the room he patted me on the shoulder, told me to take care of myself and gave me a prescription for tranquilizers. Maybe it was in my record that I was going to the DV Group and had seen a mental health counselor but I don't think so. And even if it was, shouldn't he have recommended I continue with the group and counseling or have some form of follow-up? Maybe after all the years of denial, embarrassment, etc., I expect too much of other people, especially professionals, to help me. But it was a major step for me to open up and actually be honest with someone outside of the group. I knew this but guess he didn't. Help It is only looking back on the events following my leaving that I see how the final break happened. It is very obvious to me now that there are five women that are responsible for me being where I am today, Perhaps even alive. I left on a Friday. I went to my daughter's and year-old grandson's apartment to stay. At the time I did not realize the danger I was placing them in. After a very harassing weekend, I was confused and frightened and I knew I had to get help. Monday I called not my doctor but Marilyn, my women's health practitioner. The FIRST WOMAN I talked to on the telephone was either the receptionist or the nurse. I do not recall which it was. But I can honestly say whoever that woman was she played a very important part in my recovery .I did not tell her exactly what happened or the significance of it, but she must have picked up the crisis in my call because she got me in that very day to see Marilyn. At this time there were no same day visits scheduled even if Marilyn happened to be in the clinic that day. So whoever that woman is, thank you. If you hadn't got me in immediately, I might not have come in at all. That day when I saw MARILYN, I told her what had happened. I felt as if I was coming completely apart. Because of the groundwork Marilyn had laid out with me in the past, I could do all this honest falling apart in her presence. If my only resource had been my doctor, I probably would not have gone to him. Marilyn provided treatment for my physical problems, but, more important in the long run, she made me an appointment with a mental health counselor, JANE, the very next day. The next morning, I received a telephone call from mental health encouraging me to keep my appointment with Jane. This was a very important telephone call because I was already thinking of excuses for not going. Remember for several years it had been my conditioning to not take any action on my own. Besides it was frightening and embarrassing to have to meet someone new and talk honestly about my life. The telephone call made the difference in my showing up for the appointment. After just a few minutes with Jane, I started to feel more at ease. She had lots of tissues and had a very quiet, understanding demeanor. Whether this is something counselors learn or is Jane's personality, I don't know. But it worked with me. She heard the above stories and also had me talking about my dysfunctional foster home, my troubled half-brother, and my Native American heritage. She also took me to the next crucial step in my recovery. She put me in touch with the DV therapy group, which just happened to be meeting the very next afternoon. Again, there was a telephone call the next day encouraging me to attend the group. Boy, do these workers know how we DV victims rationalize our inaction. And again, this was a real hard step for me to take. With my self esteem at an all-time low, I just did not want to see a bunch of other women in similar circumstances as myself. I especially did not want to have to admit to other people how I had let my husband hurt and control me for so long. HILLARY AND LAURA were the counselors/leaders of the group. And what a group, not what I expected. All ages, all different stages of DV represented. It was easy to go there and see what I thought were circumstances a lot worse than mine. I had never had a gun held to my head or had young children held as bargaining power against me. Hillary, Laura and the other women in group always pointed out when I was still putting my husband ahead of myself. They helped me understand I was minimizing the danger I was in and also that of my daughter and grandson. They also helped me learn how to protect myself. Hillary could be very direct when she thought I or another was not recognizing a dangerous situation. Laura would always be there with suggestions and help when it seemed like we had run up against a wall. They were nice and always available whenever I called, but they could be tough when necessary. One thing I learned about myself and group sessions is that it was always easy to not go, but I was always glad after I had attended a session. Now I find myself going to a meeting occasionally, usually during a crisis or new influence in my life. I attended the meeting right after Nicole Brown's husband was found not guilty. I found myself very angry and upset about the verdict. I believe I related it to my divorce. I felt my husband was rewarded for his abuse. In both cases, in my opinion, justice was not done. Conclusion During the training sessions, I was asked as a DV survivor what I thought the medical group could do to help other DV victims to speak out and get help. My first suggestion is to get domestic violence out in the open. Domestic violence is not a dirty word unless it is kept silent within an abusive relationship. If all the survivors of domestic abuse would come out in the open as a group, I believe society would be astounded at our numbers, our ages, our incomes, our races, etc. I always see Stop Smoking and Breast Cancer Exam posters in the clinic and exam rooms. Let's get domestic violence posters up also. Get the information out in plain view about crisis line numbers, DV shelters and groups. If I had seen DV posters when I went in to the clinic as much as I saw the others I might have sought help sooner. Remember, I was in the clinic a lot. If there are injuries, ask and ask again. Remember we are afraid, may not have any resources to escape or are so conditioned to deny even to ourselves the situation we will not be honest with the question. But if the opportunity is always given, there may come the time when the victim reaches out for help. The same is true for new patient histories. Have the question worded somehow on the form. And remember if the spouse is with the patient (sitting together in the waiting room or at home filling the questionnaire out), the victim will no way indicate there is a problem. Even just three years ago, domestic violence was still pretty much kept behind closed doors. But public awareness has been greatly heightened since then, in part because of the Nicole Brown/Ronald Goldman murders and court case. There seems to be many books, newspaper, articles, television movies, etc., addressing DV. But I still hear people asking how an intelligent woman can stay in such a relationship. I guess unless you have actually been a domestic violence victim it is hard to understand the pain, the fear, the numbness that creeps in. Remember the abuser is usually someone we have loved and \"hope springs eternal.\" But please don't discourage any victim who reaches out in any way for help. It might be the only time she ever gets the chance. |Welcome to doc.com Module 29: | Alcohol: Interviewing and Advising |by William D. Clark, M.D. and Sharon J. Parish, M.D. | \u00a9 2005-2009 by AACH, DUCoM, and others. See | | Authors: | | |Rationale| | | William Clark, MD |The Patient's View| | | Julian Bird, MD, (see module 6) plays the patient |The Alcohol use disorders are sometimes occult in clinical practice. But they afflict 20 percent or more of adults, leading to tragic family and social problems, preventable injuries, and death.(12) Most clinicians feel inadequately prepared to interact with these patients, and many express feelings of dismay, anger or outright disgust at having to do so. Effectiv assessment tools improve detection(8,10,13); and brief counseling interventions not only reduce drinking and improve health, but improve physicians' satisfaction with their encounters.(8,9,11,12,14) Helping patients to reflect on their drinking behavior and to change it requires that physicians use specific interview techniques for responding to defensiveness and resistance, and for supporting and encouraging change, as well as certain screening and data gathering strategies. This module defines and explores the spectrum of Alcohol Use Disorders, and suggests tactics to help maintain a positive and encouraging therapeutic demeanor despite patients' thinking impairments from both the toxic brain effects of alcohol and from the debilitating psychological effects of emotional isolation, loss of meaningful relationships, and emotional and physical violence to strangers as well as family members and other loved ones. We organize information and suggestions from extensive research about behavior change and from decades of clinical experience in addiction settings so that learners can apply proven strategies in their own clinical settings. Students and seasoned clinicians in primary care or specialist practices can move from common feelings of dismay and disgust when working with patients with alcohol disorders and begin to celebrate the successes they will appreciate and foster after study of this module and practice with the skills we describe. We include an APPENDIX with the AUDIT questions, and reproductions of the Tables found in the maintext section. |SPECTRUM OF ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS - A CONTINUUM| | | Alcohol use problems exist on a mild to severe continuum, and generate another continuum of physical health and psychosocial consequences. Diagnosis may be elusive because of scant or imprecise information. Nevertheless, experts agree on an evidence-based classification system that is useful in guiding physician actions.(10) The term \"alcoholism\" is used loosely, referring usually to persons with an alcohol use disorder of unspecified severity. Physicians require more specificity in order to decide what they should do to best help patients. The following paragraphs present clinically useful definitions. More extensive discussion and details of classification are in reference papers and in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV. |Alcohol dependence| | | Alcohol dependence is a severe disease manifested by multiple and persistent life problems, with or without the brain disorder of physical dependence. Individuals on the severe end of the continuum, with alcohol dependence, suffer diverse medical and psychosocial consequences from uncontrolled use. They experience tolerance or withdrawal symptoms, or make repeated attempts to cut down, or both. They are preoccupied with drinking, spend less and less time on other life activities and continue to drink despite consequences. Dependence occurs across cultures and nationalities. A striking 5-10% of American adults develop this syndrome. A distinctive, defensive interactive style develops in parallel with typical complications. Working with dependent drinkers is difficult, because they hide important facts, defend their \"right\" to drink, and respond to inquiry with hostility and reticence. If physical dependence with withdrawal symptoms is present (see below), this always means the person has alcohol dependence. |Alcohol abuse| | | People with alcohol abuse have less intense and pervasive symptoms and the brain disorder of physical dependence is absent. Alcohol abuse falls toward the center of the continuum, with consequences ranging from moderate to severe. Alcohol abuse is a \"maladaptive pattern of use leading to impairment or distress, manifested in a 12 month period by one or more of the following: failure to fulfill role obligations; recurrent use in hazardous situations; legal problems; continued use despite alcohol-related social or interpersonal problems.\" What distinguishes alcohol abuse from alcohol dependence is not the nature of the problems, but the frequency, persistence and pervasiveness of problems. Thus, both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence may include health problems, legal problems, family dysfunction, and performance problems at school or work. Many people with mild or severe alcohol abuse (below) do not progress to physical dependence because they drink intermittently, so the brain does not develop the neurochemical changes of physical addiction.(2) We repeat for emphasis- physical dependence and withdrawal syndromes always indicate alcohol dependence, (NOT alcohol abuse). |At risk or hazardous alcohol use| | | The alcohol use disorder of at risk drinking includes both drinking in unsafe situations, and drinking above recommended limits, without important or sustained life problems. On the milder end of the continuum are \"at risk\" or \"hazardous\" users. \"At risk\" drinkers use alcohol above the recommended amounts (8) (see below), but do not yet have important negative consequences. \"Hazardous\" users may use alcohol in high-risk situations such as when taking medications that interact with alcohol, during pregnancy, or while operating a chainsaw. Physicians should intervene with such drinkers on the basis of the quantity of intake and with hazardous drinkers regarding use in risky situations as well. In contrast, interventions with patients with \"abuse\" or \"dependence\" are made because of negative consequences as well as high quantity. You should obtain data about both quantity and consequences, but the meaning of the quantity remains unclear until you obtain a picture of adverse consequences or lack thereof. Most people who experience serious life consequences use excessive amounts; but the intensity of clinical interventions should be based on the severity of problems, not on the amount consumed.(2,4,10) |Healthy alcohol use| | | More than 50% of US adults abstain or drink less than 12 drinks per year. More than 30% drink more than the \"safe limits.\" Within this heavy-drinking group roughly 10% will manifest alcohol abuse and another 10% alcohol dependence, at a given point in time. NIAAA Safe Drinking Limits(8) The NIAAA expert panel declares that \"safe limits\" for men are 14 or fewer drinks a week and no more than 4 drinks in a day. For women and those over age 65, they specify limits of 7 per week and 3 drinks in a day. Moderate Drinking. Expert consensus holds that \"moderate drinking\" is defined by low quantity of intake (<14 weekly for men and < 7 for women), a social setting for drinking, and little intoxication (not more than 4 drinks per occasion for men and 3 for women). Drinking above these limits is variously called \"at risk\", or \"hazardous,\" and is likely to cause harm, according to long-term studies.(1) Standard drinks. (2,8) A drink is 12 oz. beer, 5 oz. wine, 2-3 oz. of cordial or aperitif or 1.5 oz. (bar shot) of hard liquor or brandy; and each of these standard drinks contains the same amount of alcohol. The alcohol contents are approximately: beer 5%, wine 12 %, and liquors 40% (12 oz beer x .05 (5%) = 5 oz x .12 = 1.5 oz x .40 = 0.6 oz of alcohol in each drink). Alcohol is absorbed quickly from an empty stomach; but even when taken with food, all the alcohol in drinks is absorbed. |KEY SYMPTOMS AND CLUES, AND DEVELOPMENT OF DEPENDENCE| | | The pathophysiology of alcohol use disorders is a failure to consistently limit drinking. Tolerance and physical dependence indicate important and toxic brain adjustments. You will ignore opportunities to help patients if you underestimate the meaning of tolerance, alcohol on the breath, or other clues. In this section you will find the following sub-sections |How denial works| | | \"Denial\" a loosely used term, results from cognitive deficits and emotional compartmentalization. It severely limits normal social interactions and interferes with effective and compassionate physician care. (2) Individuals modulate their drinking according to feedback from internal states such as shame or hangover, and external cues such as reprimands, criticism, and sanctions. The interplay of physiological (genetic), psychological and social factors determines an individual's success or failure in limiting use. No person is immune to the nervous tissue effects of alcohol. When a drinker is unable to consistently limit use, the brain effects of heavy use facilitate a vicious circle of using more, developing problems, and discounting the role of the intoxicant, often called \"denial.\" Denial is not only a powerful mediator of patients' interpersonal difficulties, but also of physicians' difficulty in establishing a diagnosis. Denial builds on both neurochemical and psychological changes. The brain adaptations that produce tolerance to intoxication add to cognitive deficits and the dysphoric aspects of hangover and these brain changes engender unhealthy social dynamics. Friends and family resent the apparently voluntary \"having fun and being irresponsible\" nature of over-indulgence. Drinkers become adept at ignoring reality and suppressing negative feelings. As they make excuses for their behavior, direct blame onto others, and show hostility whenever sensible limits are discussed, emotional isolation develops. They select friends and partners who tolerate heavy use and tacitly agree to overlook consequences. The \"compartmentalization\" is so extensive that family and friends, and even the patient, sometimes feel that two separate individuals inhabit the same physical body, and one of them is mysterious and unfathomable, perhaps even \"bad.\" Longer time spent in brain-altered states results in the dramatic neuro-physiologic changes of addiction and withdrawal. |Key clinical clues| | | In clinical settings tolerance, intoxication and alcohol on the breath mean a high likelihood of severe abuse or dependence. For practical purposes, withdrawal symptoms always mean dependence. Tolerance is caused by steady heavy drinking, indicates neurological adjustment to alcohol, is inevitably toxic, and usually means alcohol dependence. Tolerance is present if an odor of alcohol is apparent without evidence of intoxication- a person can look normal with very high alcohol level (even as high as 0.400 g/dl). Zero .08 is the legal level for driving. Your nose is a good breath analyzer. Alcohol on the breath in clinical situations always signals an alcohol disorder. If you easily smell it, the alcohol level (BAL) is likely greater than 0.125 g/dl, and a less dramatic odor suggests BAL of 0.07 to 0.09 g/dl. The BAL declines in linear fashion, at approximately .015-.020 g/dl/hr. If the person's BAL is initially .225, he will not arrive at 0.08 for 7-9 hours. |Intoxication| | | Intoxication (slurred speech, incoordination, emotional lability) in any medical encounter strongly suggests alcohol disorder. For example, in the Emergency Department, someone \"under the influence\" is likely to have an alcohol use disorder. Healthy drinkers who have \"one too many\" on rare occasions make up a tiny proportion of ED patients. Further, healthy drinkers would never attend a scheduled clinic appointment with alcohol on their breath. |Withdrawal symptoms| | | Withdrawal syndromes indicate brain dysfunction, and clinically indicate dependence.(2,8) In people with physical dependence, withdrawal symptoms of tremor, insomnia, anxiety and sweating occur whenever their alcohol level drops Brain chemistry changes over periods of months and usually years of heavy drinking. Withdrawal symptoms do not happen overnight, or on a short binge. The worse the physical dependence, the more quickly withdrawal symptoms develop after the \"last\" drink. People may drift off to a troubled sleep; but when they awaken, the symptoms cause an intense craving. A few trials convince the person that a drink is an effective antidote. People begin to save a beer in the refrigerator, or a drink under the bed in anticipation of shakes and anxiety during the night or in the morning; this is the eye-opener. In extreme cases people try continuously to dampen the withdrawal sickness and then drink around the clock, never really sleeping or eating. Dependent individuals in this situation develop the potentially lethal complication of delirium tremens. |Other clues| | | Unsolicited comments about alcohol, legal issues, family comments and other evidence require more intensive data-gathering. You should follow up patients' spontaneous mention of \"partying,\" hangover, blackouts or withdrawal symptoms. The same is true for a positive family history, arrests for driving while intoxicated, spouses or friends who confide about problems, and prior medical records that indicate alcohol-related problems. Interviews with family, nurses, or social workers, and records from other physicians or hospitals may contain unanticipated information that establishes a diagnosis. |IDENTIFYING ALCOHOL USE PROBLEMS| | | Current recommendations from research and consensus panels urge physicians to expand their interventions to all patients who drink alcohol. Physicians have been urged to find and treat patients with alcohol dependence; but this focus is too narrow and ignores great numbers of abusers, hazardous and at-risk users. The US Preventive Services Task Force and the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) recommend alcohol screening for all adult outpatients, as well brief counseling for those patients who screen positive.(8,13,14) Studies on the effectiveness of brief interventions demonstrate that physicians can help at risk users and abusers to avoid serious negative consequences.(8,9,10,11,12) |Foster relationship| | | Conduct compassionate conversations that build relationship, and avoid interrogations. Talking about alcohol is always a sensitive matter because the stigma of drinking affects physicians and patients. Interview style and skills not only strongly affect the quality of patients' information, but also influence patients' willingness to participate in dialogue and possible treatment. When interviews feel like interrogation, trust and effectiveness are lost. We suggest prefacing initial questions with: \"I need to ask every patient about some sensitive topics,\" or \"Information about drinking is relevant to treatment planning for many conditions.\" You can foster relationship and collaboration by weaving subsequent questions into a conversation that builds on the thread of prior exchanges with the patient. \"You mentioned feeling you should cut down. How have your attempts to do so worked out?\" Similarly, clinicians who respond to patients' irritability, defensiveness, and even suspiciousness in a respectful, dignified and empathic way enhance the likelihood of successful intervention and treatment.(2,6) Show interest in the patient as a person with voice tone, posture, and other non-verbal gestures that convey care and concern. (m13) \"Gosh, I sense that this is irritating for you. Let's focus on working together on your health.\" |SCREENING FOR ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS| | | Knowing about patients' alcohol use and misuse affects the diagnosis and management of all other medical problems and every aspect of medical care. Prescreen every new patient with one question about alcohol: \"Do you sometimes drink alcoholic beverages?\" If the answer is \"No,\" leave this topic. The abstinent subgroup with past problems often discloses this spontaneously, although the clinician may want to explore selectively why a patient is abstinent. A screen for at-risk drinking, abuse and dependency should follow a \"Yes\" answer. Small amounts of alcohol may put patients at risk in pregnancy, because of a medication interaction, or with certain health conditions. |Screening: Heavy drinking days - the AUDIT| | | Physicians are unlikely to discern alcohol use disorders unless they use a structured screening strategy. Currently, physicians miss 60% to 80% of cases. Consistent use of any validated strategy is a more powerful determinant of clinical effectiveness than which strategy a physician chooses; more importantly, lives can be saved by screening.(3,10) First, ask about heavy drinking days: \"How many times in the past year have you had 5 or more drinks in a day (for men); or 4 or more drinks (for women).\" (Positive screen is at least one day with 5 or more drinks [4 for women]) Closed questions rather than open ones(m8) are helpful here. If patients answer open-ended questions vaguely, forcing the clinician to ask clarifying questions, they quickly feel accused of lying and become defensive. If this screening is positive, quantify the drinking behavior. You can determine a weekly average by asking: \"On average, how many days a week do you have an alcoholic drink?\" and \"On a typical day, how many drinks do you have?\" Record and monitor heavy drinking days and the weekly average over time. An alternative strategy is the AUDIT questionnaire (see [Appendix](13_00.htm) of this module). The AUDIT is 10 questions. It can be self-administered in a waiting room, it is sensitive throughout the spectrum of unhealthy drinking(10) and it is the best instrument for identifying hazardous drinking (sensitivity 57-97%, specificity, 78-96%).(3,4) |Screening: CAGE| | | The 4-question CAGE test for dependence is easy to use in a clinical interview setting and a good way to begin a conversation without fostering undue defensiveness. The CAGE test (Table 1) is a validated screen. If two of the four CAGE questions are positive, it is 60%-95% sensitive and 40-95% specific for alcohol dependence, depending on the population screened. CAGE is less accurate for women and African-Americans. To better detect at-risk drinkers, the CAGE questions can be combined with consumption questions (AUDIT questions 1 to 3, question 3 alone, or questions about per occasion drinking).(10) Laboratory testing is inadequate for screening.(3) Table 1. CAGE screening for dependence symptoms. | | 1. Have you ever felt that you should cut down on your drinking? | | 2. Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? | | 3. Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking? | | 4. Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves or get rid of a hangover? (Eye opener) |Respond supportively to defensiveness, vagueness and other emotions| | | Patients with problems minimize intake and problems, and may lie outright. Remain sensitive to issues of trust and relationship, and show interest in the patient as a person with voice tone, gestures, and words that convey care and concern.(m6) Based on experiences in their families and with patients, many physicians experience frustration, or even disgust and dismay, when inquiry about alcohol is complicated by the minimization and defensiveness that accompany problems, even minor ones. This puts clinicians out of balance and may make expression of caring difficult. Remain mindful of your own feelings and the patient's emotions and learn ways to respond positively and helpfully.(m2,14) Respond to irritability and suspicion with interventions such as: \"Many people are concerned about these questions,\" or \"Let's back up a moment, as I'd like to explain why drinking might be important to your care.\" Especially when patients seem defensive, vague, put off, confused or even convey a sense of attacking the clinician, respond with a statement (not a question!) that reflects back the content of the patient's utterance. \"I hear some concern or irritation in your voice.\" or \"This line of questions seems to be confusing to you,\" or \"I'm feeling a bit confused by your responses. Help me better understand what you are saying,\" Avoid interrogation, arguing and persuading.(2,6) |FURTHER ASSESSMENT| | | When any concern is present, conduct a more detailed assessment in order to establish a diagnosis (if possible), to determine willingness to consider change. Then conduct a brief intervention when indicated. If any screen is positive (or worrisome, if not clearly positive), or if patients spontaneously disclose drinking that exceeds safe limits or if another clue from examination or the family is present, get more detail. The next step is to assess for a specific alcohol use disorder and evaluate its impact on physical, social, legal, mental, and occupational domains. In the section above are the criteria for abuse and dependence that guide the interview. Ask directly about tolerance, withdrawal and difficulty with controlling drinking, and investigate the symptoms in Table 2. Table 2. Symptoms of alcohol problems. |Somatic: | gastritis, reflux, heartburn trauma hypertension insomnia, overdose liver function disorder, and signs of cirrhosis (spiders, palmar erythema, edema, ascites, etc) anemia, high MCV, low platelets blackouts new-onset seizure |Psychosocial: | recurrent use in hazardous situations legal problems, especially driving while intoxicated continued use despite social or interpersonal problems symptoms of anxiety, depression request for psychotropic medications failure to fulfill job or role expectations job or marital stress |Assess readiness to change| | | Assess patients' readiness to change. Your dialogue with patients about next steps and about management interventions will improve when you inquire directly about interest in changing, and patients' perceived confidence in their ability to accomplish change. Prochaska and colleagues(15) proposed that people progress through a series of \"stages\" on the way to successful lifestyle change. West(15) notes the \"soft\" nature of the \"stages\" and suggests that useful interventions may NOT be offered if clinicians adhere to the stages. We agree that emphasizing readiness without affixing a \"stage\" label assists clinicians who would like to help patients consider health behavior change. Asking 2 questions about patients' conviction and confidence helps you ascertain their motivational readiness. Conviction assesses what patients believe about the importance of taking action, while confidence assesses what patients believe about their ability to adopt or change a behavior despite obstacles or barriers. The latter is often referred to as their degree of \"self-efficacy\". Ask patients to help you understand where they stand by requesting that they use a numerical rating scale. Visual \"ruler\" Not only will patients' answers to these calibration questions alert you to material not usually made explicit in medical interviews, but also many patients respond with a lot more dialogue and useful information about the past and the present. This is true even when patients protest that they do not like to use number scales. Frame your questions as follows: First--\"On a scale of 0-10, how convinced are you that cutting down or quitting is important?\" And then--\"Let's suppose for a moment that you were a 10, completely convinced that you should cut down or quit; on a 0-10 scale, how confident are you that you would be able to entirely abstain (or completely limit drinking to safe levels) (above) for the next 4 weeks?\" Usually, asking why the number chosen is not LOWER than the one the patient named proves a helpful continuation of the dialogue about change, and encourages patients to hear themselves speak about change in positive terms. You can then move more smoothly to talking about next steps. | | Ask about benefits and negatives of drinking so as to understand the place of alcohol in their lives and improve your ability to successfully intervene. Asking screen-positive patients what the good things about their drinking, as well as the not-so-good things continues the conversation. The prior \"doctor-centered\"(m5) quantity / frequency questions and symptom questions are necessary and important for diagnosis, but they limit dialogue. A more patient-centered approach is to ask patients about their perceptions of the role of alcohol. \"I'm interested in what benefits you get from drinking alcohol\" invites their perspective. \"Yes, and what else is good about drinking?\" \"And what else?\" Show that you sincerely wish to hear their thoughts. Following up with asking about the \"cons\" invites them to reflect, and contributes valuable information, not only to your assessment and diagnosis, but also to your formulation and negotiation of next steps as you move toward planning interventions. Two additional questions will contribute to your enhanced understanding of patients' perspectives. \"If you were to quit (or cut back to safe levels), what benefits could you imagine,\" or, if appropriate to your patient's situation, \"...what benefits did you notice during previous periods of abstinence?\" And, \"For you, what might be the negative consequences of cutting back?\" You might expect the \"cons\" against quitting to be the same as the \"pros\" of drinking, but they are often unrelated. An example might be that a patient says, \"I feel more sociable when I drink.\" He then reports that a \"con\" of not drinking is NOT \"feel less sociable.\" In fact, he might find some \"pros\" about sociability with not drinking, such as, \"I'd worry less about how to limit my drinking in social situations,\" or, \"I'd feel better about participating in social situations where alcohol was not available.\" This level of conversation demonstrates your interest in the particular patient's situation and shows that you value his perspective. This willingness to hear the patient contributes strongly to your ability to plan and negotiate next steps collaboratively. |Data gathering is therapeutic| | | Evaluation is ongoing and seldom completed in initial interviews, whether in the office or hospital. Balance interview time between data gathering and relationship building\u00b8 before moving to planning and advising. You can detect alcohol use disorders through screening and assessment of symptoms and clinical clues and decide whether the symptoms and signs best fit a diagnosis of moderate drinking, at-risk drinking, alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence (with or without physical dependence). Keep in mind that few assessments are completed in a single interview. All patients who use too much alcohol have high levels of ambivalence and resistance. You do not have to be certain of all details (except to recognize and treat withdrawal or other physical problems), since initial interventions will address similar dynamics about relationship, trust and the change process. During any one interview, and over multiple encounters, you obtain more data, improve the accuracy of diagnoses, and fine-tune your interventions. Experimental data show that thoughtful diagnostic conversation itself produces beneficial therapeutic effects. Other studies show that recurrent brief encounters using the style and skills discussed in the following sections are more critical to success than getting any one encounter \"exactly right.\"(2,4,6,9,14) |Assure separation of assessment and advising| | | Patients do not separate their conversation into logical sections. Respond supportively, but delay discussion of the future or potential problems until satisfied that assessment is finished for this session.(2) Patients frequently ask clinicians, \"Do you think I'm alcoholic?\" or, \"Will I have to go to AA?\" or, make statements such as, \"I can take care of this,\" or, \"Lots of my friends drink more than I do,\" or, \"I know lots of people who need treatment!\" In response, verbally acknowledge the question or statement with a reflection or a caring statement appropriate to the context, such as, \"People often ask me this question,\" or \"I see that you have been thinking about these issues.\" Secondly, avoid giving advice or speculating on options at this time, usually with a statement that turns the talk back to data gathering; such as, \"It is a bit early for me to know what my conclusions will be when we finish pulling together a bit more information,\" or \"I'm eager to discuss next steps with you, and I need a bit more information before we can do that.\" |BRIEF INTERVENTION| | | Brief interventions reduce drinking and mortality. In brief interventions, physicians review findings, make recommendations and negotiate plans tailored to readiness. Brief intervention refers to 10-15 minutes of counseling, with feedback about drinking, personalized advice, negotiation of goals, assistance with ways to achieve goals, and follow-up contact. Brief interventions, which have been studied in a variety of practice settings, decrease alcohol intake and decrease the prevalence of at-risk drinking by 10.5%. In long term follow-up studies of up to 16 years, brief intervention decreased self-reported daily and binge drinking, as well as alcohol-related mortality.(10) Clinicians who take the time to understand the patients' perspective and willingness to consider changing their drinking behavior can tailor their approach accordingly. Interviewing styles that are non-confrontational and aimed at enhancing patients' motivation are more effective at reducing (or stopping) drinking than confrontational counseling. Brief intervention can be effective whether patients are ready to take actions to change, are thinking about change, or seem dead set against change at the time of the interview.(6,10) Studies show that more than 75% of patients express some readiness to change and that the readiness correlates positively with the severity of the drinking problem. These findings contradict the common belief that severe drinkers are precontemplative. In fact patients with less severe problems are more likely to be precontemplative and likely to benefit from concern-raising brief interventions(14). |Adjust interventions to readiness| | | Physicians who make effective brief interventions adjust their suggestions, information, feedback and tactics to the patient's readiness to change, and utilize other communication strategies outlined above and below. Because only the patient can effect change, your task is to trigger change. Clinicians can create or amplify a discrepancy between patients' perception of their current status and their desired short-term or long-term goals. Evidence shows that empathic, trusted physicians who are willing to intervene and strive to build a sense of autonomy, optimism and confidence will help trigger change.(6,14) The specific strategies and skills vary according to patients' readiness to address important questions. Patients will not do things that they do not choose themselves to do. When you make a recommendation, check its effect by asking the patient about it. Commanding or ordering instead of suggesting and checking assures poor adherence. If you push ahead and try persuading patients in spite of reluctance, you foster continued ambivalence, raise resistance to change and begin an enervating downward spiral in which both you and your patient become further demoralized and discouraged. When you perceive resistance, use the skills described above and in modules 6, 13 on responding to feelings and building trust, and in modules 16, 24, and 25 on helping patients change behaviors. Since most learners are not accustomed to consciously adjusting their dialogue to patients' readiness, in the next sections we suggest example dialogues that highlight different tactics physicians might use, depending on whether patients show little interest in changing, uncertainty about changing or seem ready to take action of some kind. |Adjustment| | | In dialogue with patients who are not fully commited to changing, adjust your interventions and conversation so that you discuss which actions they might wish to take, short of actually trying to make the change. If a patient clearly demonstrates little interest in changing, use a reflective statement that acknowledges this lack of readiness. Listen, and adjust your advice so it suggests the patient take a closer look over time at the behavior and its ramifications. Remind him that you are sufficiently concerned that you will bring it up again. You might say, \"We clearly have different perspectives right now. I appreciate that you do not intend to make any changes. I wonder if you would be willing to think more about why I'm so concerned before your next appointment?\" Suppose a patient responds to inquiry and concern in a way that expresses uncertainty about changing (or outright ambivalence) that suggests at least a willingness to look more closely at the facts, such as the following: \"Thanks for your concern, Doc; you know me pretty well, so I suppose there is some truth in what you say,\" A \"motivational\" intervention that you could employ is to ask (either now, or at a subsequent interview, or suggest this as \"homework\"--your prescription for action before the next encounter), \"I appreciate that you are thinking about this. Would you tell me the good things about drinking; ...and now review the not-so-good things for me. Would you take a moment to say what you think would be good about quitting or cutting down to safe levels and now what would be not-so-good about quitting?\" Only patients can decide what the balance means, or where change fits with their life goals and values. Help explore the balance- but avoid advocating change, as this causes patients to defend the status quo.(6) Continuing, you might support autonomy and say, \"I'd value the chance to seek a deeper understanding of the total picture and help you make the best decision you can for yourself, as time goes by.\" Occasionally, patients will come to you because they are ready to take action, and seek options from a trusted source. Such a patient might say, \"You know, a fellow at work has been pushing me to go to AA, and I almost went with him after I got my DUI.\" You might respond, \"It seems to me that we agree that it might be good to do something differently right now. In fact, from a medical and health point of view, my recommendation is that you quit or dramatically curb your drinking. Many people learn a lot about themselves when they go to a few AA meetings with an open mind. Would you be willing to go to one meeting a week until I see you again in a month or so?\" |Create commitment and confidence about change| | | Tolerating patients' ambivalence, resistance and uncertainty, supporting their self-efficacy and continuing to explore their commitment and confidence encourage patients' autonomy, their adherence to plans and the likelihood of forward progress. Patients most reliably make commitments and decisions in an atmosphere that genuinely tolerates and respects the full expression of ambivalence, resistance and uncertainty, with respect to both facts and feelings. Create such an atmosphere by using reflection and explicitly emphasizing the patient's autonomy, while offering (not pushing) your own expertise and support. Emphasize autonomy by reminding patients that they are in charge of all the important decisions and free to choose action (or inaction).(2,6) Here are some suggestions about how to build confidence by naming positive traits (appreciating their strengths,) or by reflecting patients' own skepticism. You augment patients' confidence about change when you witness out loud their special and unique strengths. Tell the patient why he has a chance of success, based on facts you know about his unique characteristics, past successes, attitude, and other attributes. \"You've told me how independent, even stubborn, you can be and that may mean that when you decide to do something difficult, you can stick to it.\" Psychologists call this action \"supporting self-efficacy.\" When the patient makes a statement that is positive, or hopeful, or promises success, express the patient's previously stated skepticism or ambivalence. This intervention helps patients express their own commitment; your reflection of prior patient statements encourages them to take the \"healthful\" side in the dialogue, perhaps even to claim strength, or give a new reason for hope. |SHARING INFORMATION AND NEGOTIATING PLANS| | | Patients' behaviors and interview dynamics are often demoralizing, and challenge your caring instincts and communication skills. You can structure interventions that successfully overcome these barriers. To alcohol dependent patients, change seems unimaginable, like jumping into a featureless abyss. As preoccupation with alcohol progresses, many patients ignore reality, suppress negative feelings, and smoothly reject sound advice. Many behaviors are negative, confusing, and hurtful. This behavior distorts physicians' experience of caring for patients, and is profoundly unsatisfying. Physician behaviors begin to mirror patients' lack of awareness, reluctance, and often hopelessness. Physicians fail to intervene, they do not use constructive skills and problems remain unaddressed. Studies of successful interventions show that effective clinicians give information and advice in dialog, calibrate the advice to patients' readiness to change, and make recommendations clearly, but without persuasion or pressure. They roll with resistance by skillfully reflecting back patients' statements, and remain consistently relationship-centered by responding to irritability and defensiveness empathically.(2,6) |Create dialog| |Get into dialog by alternating \"asking\" and \"telling.\" In dialogue, respond to resistance with skillful reflection, and respond to agreement by telling more.| Employ a format of \"ask, tell, ask.\"(m 10) Ask for permission to discuss these issues, and then tell short bits of information or advice, and then ask the patient what he thinks about it, or how it feels to hear it, or what he intends to do about it. Keeping the \"telling\" brief helps clarity, and \"asking\" allows patients to choose \"change enhancing\" or \"change obstructing\" responses. \"Asking\" fosters exploration and choice. How patients respond to the \"asking\" also suggests helpful next steps. Generally, \"change enhancing\" responses include statements of agreement, commitment or optimism; they suggest that exploring the facts might be helpful. Generally, \"change obstructing\" responses, such as disagreement, reservation, pessimism, defensiveness, non-committal statements, and questions that do not ask for clarification of meaning suggest that the clinician should reflect back the response as the next step in the conversation. Reflection invites patients to look inside themselves, and encourages motivation and discrepancy. Continue to avoid persuasion and argument. |Create an objective, scientific climate| | | Minimize defensiveness and argument by starting with facts, not conclusions, opinions or authoritative statements; look for options together. Create a climate of fact, not opinion, by giving all information, feedback, and recommendations in an \"objective\" or \"scientific\" way. Physicians who seem judgmental or display an attitude of, \"I know what is right for you\" make patients defensive and encourage arguments. After exploration of the facts, give advice tentatively, as part of a search for options or alternatives. \"Wagging one's finger,\" tends to push patients into a corner, highlights any feelings of shame or stigma, and generally inhibits discussion. In this section, we discuss or show: |Factual information| | | Tell patients the scientific facts that are relevant, and check whether they understand them. People need to hear many basic facts directly from their physicians. Give information about what is known about alcohol problems in an impersonal way. \"Research shows that treatment helps;\" or \"Steady drug use changes brain function;\" or \"Having a high tolerance for alcohol means that a person is deprived of the early warning system that tells him to stop drinking before the alcohol level gets so high as to be dangerous;\" or \"95% of men drink less than 35 drinks per week;\" or \"Generally, being sick in the morning until after a drink means a person's brain has become hooked on alcohol.\" Create a dialogue and relationship by asking the patient what he thinks of this information. |Patient's facts| | | Next, feed back to patients the facts of their story, using numbers and scores whenever possible. Give feedback about the patient's situation as a fact, a number or score, rather than a conclusion: \"Three of your liver tests are abnormal,\" rather than: \"alcohol has damaged your liver;\" or \"Your alcohol level when you arrived in the ED was .160,\" rather than: \"You were drinking heavily before you came into the ED;\" or \"You mentioned 3 important things, -- that your relationship with your wife is going poorly, that you are having stomach trouble, and that you lost your license to drive;\" rather than: \"Alcohol is wrecking your marriage, your career, and your body.\" Next, ask the patient what he thinks of this information. The patient's response to the \"ask,\" indicates whether motivation and discrepancy are enhanced, and gives the physician ideas about next steps in the intervention. |INTERVENTION: ADVICE| | | Be clear and definite about your recommendation, but remain in relationship and dialogue by avoiding commands and persuasion. Do not force patients into a \"yes\" or \"no\" situation; find some action which the patient can agree to undertake. Using guidelines for safe use, negotiate a drinking goal for patients' with at-risk alcohol use. Recommend abstinence for patients' with alcohol abuse or dependence. Give advice and explicit recommendations with four characteristics: This might sound like: \"Your weekend drinking is clearly above the safe limits that the NIAAA and other experts advise. I recommend that we try to work out a plan for you to cut back to safe limits\" or, \"I recommend, based on data in the medical literature and my experience with experts who have advised me about similar patients, is that you stop drinking all alcohol. Of course, no one can be certain that this will work for you.\" or, \"Most people find that talking with people in Alcoholics Anonymous is helpful. AA might or might not be right for you. I recommend you go there.\" Next, ask the patient what he thinks of this advice. Be clear, but not argumentative or demanding.(m10,11) |Treatment and follow up| | | Your Brief Intervention is not \"treatment\" for most patients. Treatment programs provide patients with specialized care, such as self-help, daily care, intensive support and counseling. Help patients follow through with referrals. Recommend a mutual help group for patients with alcohol abuse or dependence. Alcohol dependent patients may benefit from access to medical detoxification and multidisciplinary counseling opportunities. Severity of the drinking problem and consequences, more than specific diagnosis of at-risk, abusive, or dependent use informs your ultimate referral recommendation. Many communities have programs for patients with special needs, such as adolescents, women, and patients with psychiatric problems. Most people know about Alcoholics Anonymous, and other self-help alternatives exist in many communities; two examples are Rational Recovery and Women for Sobriety. Both inpatient and outpatient treatment programs help patients initiate and continue contact with community based self-help, halfway houses, and intensive counseling. Physicians who work in treatment programs are better prepared to prescribe and monitor medications discussed below. Confirm your patients' intention and commitment to follow through. Additionally, emphasize your need for specialist assistance. Set up the appointment before patients leave the office. Tell patients you will send a referral letter summarizing your views and asking for advice. Let patients know that you will speak with the specialist and that you would like to participate in the treatment plan and provide follow-up with visits to your office. |Additional office help for patients| | | Some physicians might wish to enhance office-based brief interventions with additional discussion and recommendations for at-risk users and those with milder substance abuse. Set aside the time, such as 30-40 minutes, for a longer visit. Asking a family member or friend to attend visits is helpful. Investigate the details about how drinking fits into daily life. Then ask patients to list the positive and negative aspects of changing their alcohol use. This results in a list of situations and triggers. Jointly problem-solve to develop specific methods to cope with these situations. Patients can write in a diary or notebook and review it daily as a reminder to practice using new strategies. See patients weekly for a time, to assure success and make modifications of strategy or referral. |Pharmacological considerations in primary care practice| | | In addition to treating medical complications (examples: trauma, liver problems, infections), physicians can usefully prescribe medications to help with dependence issues. Examples include benzodiaepines for treatment mild or severe withdrawal, and naltrexone or disulfiram.(2) |CONCLUSION| | | Alcohol use disorders exist on a spectrum. Discovering alcohol use disorders and intervening with affected patients can make a difference in health-related outcomes. The dialogue of brief interventions varies according to both severity and patients' readiness to change. In summary, always attend to clues about any alcohol disorder, and intervene if you have any concern. Do not wait. Secondly, when problems are obvious, progress may be slow, but data show that using relationship centered intervention skills succeeds, and that if you persist in building relationship during repeated Brief Interventions over time you can make a difference. Thirdly, serious cases are discouraging and painful and require more resources than any one person can provide, so a key aspect of your work is to foster your patients' integration with networks of helpers like AA or comprehensive treatment programs. |BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST| 1.

Version History: |Rationale| |by Barbara A. Schindler, M.D.| The Patient's View The Doctor's View |Questions for Reflection:| Please pick one or two of the questions and type in a brief paragraph! | | |Key Principles:| |Learning Goals:| At completion of this module, you will be able to: |INTRODUCTION| | | Substance abuse and substance dependence are commonly seen in patients in medical practices, and are frequently co-morbid with other medical and psychiatric disorders. Considerable societal stigma exists toward patients with substance use disorders; healthcare providers frequently have negative attitudes toward these patients as well. Fortunately, there are established communication skills you can master that will facilitate the establishment of therapeutic relationships and motivate patients for treatment. Substance abuse and substance dependence have a 10.3% lifetime prevalence; yet, they are routinely underdiagnosed by healthcare providers. (2, 3) Approximately 20.1 million Americans age 12 and older used illicit drugs in the past month (8.0% of the population). (4) The prevalence of illicit drug use is 7 to 20% in ambulatory practices and up to 50% in trauma patients. (1) Psychiatric and physical co-morbidities are very common, and 60% or more of patients with substance use or dependence suffer from an additional psychiatric disorder.(4,5) In 2008, an estimated 23.1 million persons age 12 or older needed treatment for an illicit drug or alcohol use problem (9.2% of the population over 12). Of these, 2.3 million (0.9% of the population and 99% of those who needed treatment and received it) received treatment at a specialty facility.(4) In addition to the health and social consequences, these high rates of use and of undertreated patients contribute to the staggering financial costs of substance use (illicit drugs and alcohol), which are estimated at $416 billion per year. These costs, do not, however, translate into treatment costs. For example, in 2003, only 1.3% ($21 billion) of total health care expenditures were for the treatment of alcohol and drug disorders.(6,7) People with substance use disorders are heavily stigmatized. Physicians are not immune from negative attitudes about substance use disorders. The identification, assessment and referral for treatment of patients are strongly influenced by physician attitudes and life experiences with personal, family, or prior patients' substance use. Effective tools and strategies can help you recognize the physiologic and behavioral red flags of addiction and elicit a substance use history in a nonjudgmental manner, so you can make the appropriate diagnosis and develop a patient-specific plan for treatment and referral. (8) This educational module on the clinical assessment of substance abuse disorders presents written text and instructional videos that provide the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed in the screening, evaluation, and referral of patients with substance use disorders. The video examples in this module focus on prescription drug abuse, a common and increasing problem in clinical practice. However, the strategies for screening and referral that we present are the same for all substance use disorders. For additional information on drug abuse and addictive disorders, please go to the National Institute on Drug Abuse's NIDAMED Web site: [http://www.drugabuse.gov/nidamed](http://www.drugabuse.gov/nidamed)/ |MEDICAL MODEL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE| | | Substance use disorders are complex chronic, relapsing and remitting diseases in both presentation and pathogenesis, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Despite the neurochemical changes and the chronic and relapsing nature of these diseases, treatment is effective and recovery possible. |Diagnostic Criteria| | | To serve your patients well, you must know features that distinguish the substance use disorders from one another and from non-problem-use. More important, you must take action when you are concerned, even if you cannot make a definitive diagnosis. The DSM IV criteria for distinguishing substance use disorders, including substance abuse, dependence, and substance-induced disorders, are delineated in the next sections. The symptoms that practicing clinicians witness are frequently only the tip of the iceberg. Any concern on your part may indicate a more serious problem. Therefore, take action as soon as your screening protocols or the presence of any \"red flag\" suggests substance use problems. Refer all patients with evidence of a substance use disorder for further evaluation and possible treatment by a substance abuse professional. Substance abuse specialists have the time and tools to make an exhaustive diagnostic inquiry; to distinguish between substance use, abuse, and dependence; and to adjust their interventions accordingly. |Substance Use Disorders and Substance Related Disorders| | | The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV-TR (12), categorizes Substance Use Disorders and Substance-Induced Disorders, and specifies criteria for diagnosis: Abuse and dependence are maladaptive patterns of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested by persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused by substance use. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM-IV-TR, categorizes Substance Use Disorders and Substance-Related Disorders as follows: 1) Substance Use Disorders include: - Substance Abuse: Maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress as manifested by one or more of the following social or interpersonal problems caused by use of substance, within a 12 month period: - Recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations at work, school or home. - Recurrent substance use in situations in which it is physically hazardous - Recurrent substance related legal problems. - Continued substance use despite persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems caused or exacerbated by the effects of the substance. - Substance Dependence: Maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to impairment as manifested by three or more of the following in any 12 month period of time: - Tolerance- either 1) marked need to increase amounts of substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect or 2) markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of substance - Withdrawal- either 1) characteristic withdrawal symptoms of a specific substance or 2) use of the same or similar substance to avoid withdrawal symptoms - Substance taken in a larger amounts or over a longer period of time than was intended - Persistent desire or unsuccessful effort to cut down or control use - Excessive time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance or recover from its effects - Important social, occupational or recreational activities are given up or reduced - Substance use continues despite knowledge of having persistent physical and/or psychological problems caused by the substance 2) Substance-Related Disorders include, but are not limited to: - Intoxication - Withdrawal - Delirium and dementia - Amnestic disorder - Psychotic disorder - Mood disorder - Anxiety disorder - Sexual dysfunction - Sleep disorder |SCREENING FOR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS| | | A good clinical interview includes questions about substance use and sequelae of use across medical, psychiatric, personal, legal and social domains. Pay close attention to high risk or under recognized patients including pregnant women, young and older adolescents, older adults, Native Americans, health care providers, noncompliant patients, those with major psychiatric disorders and individuals in the criminal justice system. |Please click the video-button on the left to play | With adult patients, start with a question about use: \"Do you use, or have you ever experimented with alcohol or other substances?\" If \"yes\", or if the answer is equivocal, follow with: - Have you ever felt a need to Cut Down on or Control your use of alcohol or other drugs? - Have friends/family made comments to you about your use of alcohol or other drugs have those comments ever Annoyed you? - Have you ever felt bashful, embarrassed or Guilty about things you have said/done when using alcohol or other drugs that you would not have said/done otherwise? - Do you ever use Eye-openers (drinking or using in the morning to \"get going\" or settle your nerves)? |Please click the video-button on the left to play | One helpful strategy is to ask the patient about his/her perspectives and observations about their use and consequences. Helpful questions include the following: - Do you ever think you use too much? - Have you ever tried to cut down on your use? - Have you needed to use more to get the same effect? - Has use created any problems, e.g. medical, educational, job? |Red Flags for Substance Use Disorders| | | Despite good interview skills and use of effective screening tools, many patients with serious substance use disorders escape identification in physicians' offices. Attending to behavioral and physical red flags will help you identify a significant subset of patients who would otherwise remain \"under the radar,\" and thus not benefit from intervention. Patients with substance use disorders are often reluctant to reveal them. They may fear negative judgments, be embarrassed about their inability to control their lives, or be in denial about the extent of their problems. In a variety of subtle or not-so-subtle ways, patients effectively avoid disclosure. Their methods include not listening to questions; minimizing use or consequences of use; changing the topic; showing irritation, anxiety, or other symptoms that discourage further inquiry; blocking many facts from their own consciousness; and outright lying. However, there may be signals that appear in an interview, during the physical exam, in prior records or in statements from significant others, office staff, or hospital staff, that raise concern about a patient's substance use. These \"red flags,\" whether mentioned by the patient, family, or another information source, should be an indication to follow up with the same diligence and persistence as you would after a positive drug screen or disclosure of heavy substance use, in order to ascertain the presence of a substance use disorder and the patient's readiness to accept treatment. Some common \"red flags\" are in the bulleted list below. |Physician Attitudes| | | All patients have the same human needs for feeling well, attachment to others, and sense of self-control. Clinicians who have had difficult experiences with patients or others with addictive disorders may expect patients who have a substance use disorder to betray their trust and to manipulate them with drug-seeking behavior. These early experiences can lead to persistent negative attitudes, including cynicism and hopelessness resulting in lack of empathy and poor or inadequate screening for substance use disorders. These negative physicianpatient interactions can also adversely impact patients' willingness to discuss use and accept referrals for treatment. (17) You can enhance your care of patients with substance use disorders by reflecting on your own attitudes and discussing them with colleagues, by increasing your knowledge about the medical nature of the disease and the effects of substance use disorders on patients' lives, and by practicing discussions about diagnosis and treatment with patients who are fearful and discouraged. |Please click the video button on the left to hear | Respond to irritability and suspicion with interventions that reflect what you hear | | When patients express irritation with your reflections or your limit-setting, or at their own shortcomings, here are some helpful responses for you to consider. | | |Physical Examination| | | Prognosis for recovery is better if diagnosis and intervention are made early in the course of the disease. Some physical findings may be present in early stages of substance use disorders. Others, particularly the \"classic\" physical findings occur only in later stages. Injuries from accidents, or from altercations in the home or on the streets, may appear early in the course of substance use disorders, and they are always cause for active intervention. Other early clues include alcohol on the breath; signs of intoxication such as abnormal gait, slurred speech, sedation, dilated or constricted pupils, excoriated skin (from scratching), track marks, and skin abscesses; and behavioral symptoms such as irritability, vagueness, paranoia, and poor concentration. The earlier a diagnosis is made, the better the prognosis. However, use over periods of years produces physical findings that make diagnosis much easier. Some examples of physical symptoms and findings that ensue after persistent use include the following: Intervention may seem more difficult in later stages of the disease process, but many patients have suffered enough by that time and are more ready to accept the diagnosis and referral for treatment with experienced professionals. Be clear about availability and efficacy of treatment, even after many years of destructive use; be respectful and compassionate; and be persistent with later-stage patients. For more information about specific medical consequences of substance use, please see [http://www.nida.nih.gov/consequences/](http://www.nida.nih.gov/consequences/) |Laboratory Evaluation| | | Lab testing has limited usefulness in the diagnosis of substance use disorders and in the discovery of associated physical harm. Drug testing does not measure severity of the disease. However, testing to monitor drug use is an important component of every treatment regimen. |THE BRIEF INTERVENTION| | | When clinical screening indicates a potential substance use disorder, assess the patient's readiness to change and conduct a brief intervention to facilitate treatment engagement. Take steps to determine the patient's willingness to accept the diagnosis and accept further exploration, intervention, and referral for treatment. Prior to discussing treatment options, check patients' readiness to change their behavior. Inquire directly about patients' interest in changing and about their confidence in accomplishing change. In a brief intervention, you tell the patient your diagnosis and specific recommendations in a matter-of-fact and non-confrontational way. You offer educational materials and choices about next steps, emphasize that any change is up to the patient, and convey confidence in the patient's ability to change his or her behaviors. You help the patient work out appropriate and doable next steps toward accomplishing your recommendations. Encourage the patient to regularly report progress toward his or her established goals. (18) You then make definite treatment recommendations, tailoring your conversation based on the patient's apparent readiness to take action. Acknowledge that the patient is the one who decides what to do and, in fact, does all the real work. Most physicians find that telling patients of a diagnosis of addiction is a difficult task, an uncomfortable example of \"giving bad news.\" The discomfort can arise from an incomplete understanding of the pathophysiology of substance use disorders, from previous negative experiences with substance abusing patients, from negative judgments about the patient's behaviors (impulsivity or criminal activity), and from a lack of practice with skills for this special type of doctor-patient interaction. The following guidelines present ideas about the content of recommendations, the process of giving them, and some \"how to's\" about skills for responding to patients' reactions, as well as information that may assist you in examining your own biases. |Determining Readiness to Change| | | When clinical screening indicates a potential substance use disorder, take steps to determine the patient's willingness to accept the diagnosis and accept further exploration, intervention and referral for treatment. Prior to discussing treatment options, check patients' readiness to change their behavior. Inquire directly about patients' interest in changing, and about their confidence in accomplishing change. Researchers have found that patients go through a series of predictable stages in the process of changing unhealthy behaviors. Stages of change include: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. (20) It is important to understand what stage your patient is in, since your counseling will need to address the patient's particular needs and expectations relevant to that stage. Briefly, in Precontemplation, the patient is content with the behavior and doesn't see the need to change. In Contemplation, the patient understands that there are benefits of the behavior, but also risks and current negative consequences, and is thinking about changing the behavior. In Preparation, the patient has decided that it is best to change the behavior, begins to gather information on what it will take to change, and plans concrete actions necessary to change. In Action, the patient undertakes the necessary behavior, social, and environmental changes necessary. In Maintenance, the patient practices the many behaviors necessary to substitute for the previous unhealthy behaviors and to avoid restarting the previous behaviors. In Relapse, the patient restarts the previous unhealthy behaviors and usually returns to the contemplation stage. Asking two questions about patients' conviction and confidence helps you ascertain their motivational readiness. Conviction assesses what patients believe about the importance of taking action, and confidence assesses what patients believe about their present ability to adopt or change a behavior (despite obstacles or barriers.) The latter is often referred to as their degree of \"self-efficacy.\" Ask patients to help you understand where they stand by using a numerical rating scale. \"On a scale of 010, how convinced are you that quitting cocaine is important?\" Not only will patients' answers to readiness questions alert you to material not usually made explicit, but also many patients respond with more dialogue and useful information about the past and the present. This is true even when patients protest that they do not like to use number scales. Usually, asking why the number the patient chose is not LOWER than the one the patient named proves a helpful continuation of the dialogue. You may wish to incorporate this tactic in your Brief Intervention (below), perhaps saying, \"So you are at a \"6\" about thinking you need to quit cocaine; I'm wondering why you did not name a lower score?\" Asking about lower scores encourages patients to speak (and to hear themselves speak) about change in positive terms. You can then move more smoothly to talking about next steps. Frame your confidence question as follows: \"Let's suppose for a moment that you were a 10, completely convinced that you should cut down or quit; on a 010 scale, how confident are you that you would be able to entirely abstain for the next 4 weeks?\" If the patient chooses a low number, you might ask, \"What would it take for you to get your confidence level higher, say to an 8?\" The patient may then suggest strategies that develop a greater sense of self-efficacy and hope. |Content of a Brief Intervention| | | This section delineates the principles and rationale for a brief intervention, along with sample dialogue for handling patients' denial and their normal resistance to changing their behavior that has progressed to the point that it controls their lives. Depending on severity, you will support positive lifestyle choices, recommend abstinence from illicit drug use, recommend that psychoactive prescription drugs be taken only as prescribed, and suggest referral to professional treatment. All intervention dialogue with patients should be When talking about next steps, present information without alienating patients who may be ashamed, in denial, ambivalent, or resistant to change. The use of shame, guilt, threats, confrontation, arguments, and arbitrary treatment plans is counterproductive and should be avoided. Express optimism about recovery and willingness to continue to work collaboratively with your patients. (18) NIDA Info-Facts for \"Understanding Drug Abuse and Addiction\" are available at [http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/understand.html](http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/understand.html) Non-problem use: For patients who are using substances but appear to be at low risk of a substance use disorder, give them information about safe limits for alcohol use, and acknowledge that the only reasonable advice about other drug use is not to use illicit substances and not to exceed amounts prescribed for any psychoactive prescription drugs. Continue to screen patients periodically to verify that they have not developed a substance use disorder. Substance use disorders: Explicitly and clearly recommend that patients with substance abuse or dependence abstain from all illicit drugs. For patients with a co-morbid psychiatric disorder, help the patient find a qualified psychiatrist to prescribe and supervise the taking of any appropriate psychoactive drugsit is particularly helpful if the psychiatrist is associated with a substance use disorder treatment program. Coordination of care is essential. Do not prescribe any psychoactive drugs for patients, unless they are active in a treatment program, and then only with specific guidance from that program; otherwise your prescriptions may not be effective, and they are likely to worsen patients' problems. Articulate your medical concerns and be specific about the patient's substance use and the related medical issues. Provide patients with written information from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) about drug abuse disorders and steps they can take. It is important to convey that you believe they need the help of substance abuse professionals and that you would like to refer them to local treatment programs. Substance dependence: Recommendations for patients who have progressed to dependence are essentially the same as for substance abuseabstinence and participation in local treatment programs. Office counseling is rarely useful for patients who are not participating in other treatment activities and it unwittingly contributes to prolonging or worsening the dependent state. You may wish to follow up and support such patients, but leave the treatment to professionals. | | Under normal clinical situations, you should not prescribe medications that drug-dependent patients can abuse. Instead of prescribing, respectfully and calmly say \"no\" and continue recommending that the patient take advantage of specialist treatment. No matter how persuasive (or demanding) patients are, or how much you think a small dose of \"x\" might ease their suffering, we cannot emphasize enough this caveat. Patients who are drug dependent and require narcotic medication for pain management following surgery or trauma should be managed collaboratively, by their surgeon/trauma physician, dentist, and addiction treatment professional. The patient always needs to be an integral part of the treatment team. |Dealing with Resistant Patient Behaviors| | | Behavior change is difficult for everyone. Patients' resistance to accepting a substance use diagnosis or treatment is frustrating and often contributes to physicians' negative counter-transference behavior and defensiveness. Talking with patients who do not appear to want help enervates physicians. In dialogue with a respectful physician, some patients are prepared to accept their diagnosis and a treatment referral. On the other hand, many do not initially. Physicians who seek to understand patients' resistance to change can develop an effective treatment alliance. During ongoing conversations they can use their understanding of the nature of resistance to augment patients' intrinsic motivation and hopefulness and shepherd patients towards recovery. In the following example, the physician addresses denial directly and uses \"reflection\" in a genuine attempt to understand and hear the patient's perspective. | | |TREATMENT OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS| | | Treatment for substance abuse or dependence requires specialist care from certified counselors or comprehensive community programs or mutual help groups. You should understand the core principles of treatment, so you can best advise your patients. | | The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommends a set of overarching principles that characterize effective substance use disorder treatments. |BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST| - Screen every patient for drug use with structured questions, such as the CAGE-AID or the NIDA Modified ASSIST (available at [www.drugabuse.gov/nidamed]) - Follow up positive screens or \"red flags\" by assessing details of drug use and consequences of use. - Calibrate patient's readiness to accept a substance use diagnosis and referral for treatment. - Show nonjudgmental empathic verbal and non-verbal behaviors during screening, evaluation and intervention conversations. - Obtain patients' perspective on current and potential consequences of their drug use. - Conduct a brief intervention. - Inform patients about the potential impact of substance use on health, family, employment, mental health and well-being. - Inform patients clearly and succinctly about treatment options and make referrals for treatment. - Demonstrate your willingness to provide continuing care to patients with substance use disorders. - Communicate with the patient's family. - Inform patients about the role of drug and alcohol testing in treatment monitoring. - When recommending treatment, communicate the following points to the patient: - Individual needs vary, and treatment consists of psychological, social, vocational, and biological interventions. Treatment programs assess these needs, organize interventions, and monitor all aspects of treatment and recovery. - Referral to addiction specialists is vital. - Detoxification is only a first step in treatment for substance use disorders. - Medications may be helpful, but never in isolationtherefore, psychoactive drug prescriptions will need to be given by a specialist within a broader treatment program. - Recovery is a long-term process, and it often takes years to return to fully responsible functioning. ***module=30 page=6_0_Behavior_Skills.htm*** Module: 30 - Compton, WM, Thomas, YF, Stinson, FS, Grant, BF.

Medically Unexplained Symptoms (MUS) refers to physical symptoms that occur without demonstrable organic disease. In the many patients who have a demonstrable organic disease, \"MUS\" refers to symptoms that are out of proportion to the organic disease, or inconsistent with the organic disease. (1, 2) Patients with MUS form a heterogeneous group, with a spectrum of presentations ranging from mild to severe. (5, 6) Symptoms such as headache, itch, pain or concern about a \"lump\" or \"swelling\" may be mild or severe and symptom duration may be brief or persistent for years. Co-morbid organic and psychiatric diseases are common across the entire severity spectrum of MUS. On the severe end of the spectrum, patients' disorder is likely worsened by the negativity of their physicians' interactions with them as well as by repetitive and fruitless testing, drugs and surgery. Psychological dysfunction, functional disability, and misuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs (7, 8) increase with increasing severity of MUS. Patients with severe MUS are likely to have been physically or sexually abused. (9, 10) Most physicians express frustration, dismay and a sense of helplessness in the presence of people without demonstrable organic diseases (often understood as, \"without real diseases,\") who repeatedly fail to respond positively to reassurance based on many negative tests. Sometimes patients imply that their doctors should order more tests, or are somehow deficient because they have not found the diseases that are causing so much suffering and surely could be treated, if only uncovered! ***module=31 page=01_0.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 02_0.htm MUS IS A COMMON DISORDER IN ALL MEDICAL PRACTICES Medically unexplained symptoms are very common in primary care practice. Most symptoms resolve spontaneously. Puzzled or worried primary care physicians frequently refer patients to specialists, and patients with MUS have high medical expenses. The prevalence of patients with MUS in outpatient settings ranges from 25 75% depending on the definition used. (46, 47) One study could identify organic disease in a mere 16% of ambulatory patients with new symptoms. (12) A follow-up prospective study revealed that about 70% of patients improve after 2 weeks and sustain the improvement for 3 months. (48) Another primary care study found that 51% of patients with a yearly average of 5 or more visits had moderate MUS and 14% had severe MUS.(15) The prevalence of severe MUS ranges from 4.4 22% in the community to 33% in outpatient settings. (15) One investigator estimates the yearly healthcare costs for MUS patients at over $256 billion. (46) This does not account for excessive utilization in mild MUS or the costs of lost wages and early retirement. Some physicians use \"MUS\" interchangeably with \"somatization.\" However, MUS does not preclude the possibility of underlying explanatory pathophysiologic changes (1, 3), nor does it preclude that improved understanding in the future could provide organic disease explanations for some of what we now call MUS. (4) MUS should not be confused with Somatization Disorder, which describes a specific and very small group of patients with MUS (see below). ***module=31 page=02_0.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 03_0.htm SYMPTOMS MAY BE TRANSIENT OR PERSISTENT AND COMPLEX Most patients with MUS have few symptoms that resolve spontaneously, while those with persistent symptoms usually receive excessive tests and consultations, but seldom a proper diagnosis or treatment. Patients experience dysfunction in many life domains, and those with severe MUS often have concomitant psychiatric diagnoses. - Mild MUS Patients with mild MUS experience few unexplained symptoms (usually one or two) that last from days to weeks and do not lead to high healthcare utilization. (6, 11, 12) Physicians often arrange unnecessary diagnostic tests (12) but seldom make the diagnosis of mild MUS because patients' symptoms are self-limited. It seems likely that factors such as \"stress\" and \"worry\" generate patients' symptoms, but patients with mild MUS have not been systematically studied, (13,14) perhaps because they are difficult to differentiate from \"normal.\" (5,6) \"Mild\" patients probably make up 80% of all MUS cases in clinical settings, (6) and if physicians were able to make this diagnosis and provide interventions we discuss below, many excessive laboratory tests, unnecessary treatments and iatrogenic complications could probably be eliminated. - Moderate MUS Perhaps 15% of all MUS patients in clinical settings have more than 2 unexplained symptoms that endure 1 to 6 months and high rates of healthcare utilization. For example, these patients with moderate MUS average 8 or more visits a year for their unexplained symptoms. (15) An estimated 20% of patients with moderate MUS have psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, dysthymia or substance abuse. (6) They express worries about persistent unexplained symptoms, and many think they are in poor health. (16) Many patients with moderate MUS have psychological dysfunction that does not meet criteria for a specific diagnosis, and present a significant challenge for their clinicians. (17) - Severe MUS Patients with severe MUS - perhaps 5% of all MUS patients - have chronic and multiple unexplained physical symptoms that endure more than 6 months and also result in functional impairments and excessive utilization of healthcare resources. (18) When primary care clinicians establish the diagnosis they lack confidence in their ability to care for such patients. Moreover, they often miss the diagnosis and simply perceive patients with severe MUS as \"difficult,\" (19, 20) and order excessive tests and consultations. Studies suggest that two thirds of patients with severe MUS meet criteria for a psychiatric disorder, (23) with roughly two thirds of these disorders being personality disorder. (24, 25) Investigators studying severe MUS have made the psychiatric diagnoses of \"Somatoform Disorder\" (includes hypochondriasis, conversion disorder and somatization disorder) or medical diagnoses of \"Functional Somatic Syndromes,\" (including multiple chemical sensitivities, sick building syndrome, and Gulf War syndrome). However, the validity of these latter diagnoses is questionable because of significant overlap in symptom criteria. (2, 5, 21) Fibromyalgia,(32) chronic fatigue syndrome (33) and irritable bowel syndrome (34) are more established. ***module=31 page=03_0.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 04_0.htm WHERE DO MUS SYMPTOMS COME FROM? A biomedical perspective limits understanding of MUS. A useful model for understanding the genesis of symptoms and the dysfunctions of patients with MUS is one that extends beyond biomedicine to the complex domains of psychodynamics, personality styles, neurobiology and behavior. The notion of entirely unexplainable physical symptoms puzzles clinicians and dismays patients. (1) Western cultures' acceptance of a mind-body duality demands that clinicians explain what body dysfunction produces symptoms (\"we must find the broken part\") and drives patients' search for legitimate sick roles so that they can access support and resources, and take actions on their illnesses (\"what can my doctor and I do to fix this broken part?\") The \"gate control\" theory of pain provides an overarching biological explanation for unexplained symptoms. (51-54) This theory encompasses the biopsychosocial dimensions that we list as 'causative' factors below, and suggests that long-term cortical representations of factors such as family dynamics, socio-cultural influences, past trauma, and prior interactions with providers modulate a \"gating\" mechanism in the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. These central representations lead, on balance, to less inhibition (\"a more open gate\") for centrally directed pain impulses (and other symptoms) ascending through the spinal cord. While the stoic person has greater inhibition and feels little pain, the unfortunate MUS patient has less inhibition, and more symptoms. The open gate makes it more likely for the MUS patient that pain and other symptoms gradually become more ingrained, that is, expected and anticipated. The chronic and recurrent anticipation and expectation of pain generates a chronic stress response that produces the suffering experience of the MUS patient. According to recent experimental data, the cortical representations act through a central pain matrix consisting of areas of the orbitofrontal and somatosensory cortices, thalamus and limbic system via multiple neurotransmitters. The following abbreviated paragraphs present additional research and scholarly thinking about each of the biopsychosocial dimensions that \"cause\" MUS symptoms and distress. - Engel (35) eloquently described psychodynamic theories, whose basic premise is that patients' symptoms are symbolic and express an underlying and unconscious conflict. A common scenario is a patient whose symptoms represent punishment, and thus serve to ease unconscious feelings of guilt. - Some personality traits or styles predispose to development of MUS. (36, 37, 38) Histrionic or passive-aggressive styles, for example, are associated with MUS, and may promote misinterpretations of normal body sensations or excessive worry; personality disorders such as borderline personality sometimes accompany severe MUS. - Neurobiologists think that abnormalities within central nervous system pathways for sensory impulses (particularly for pain) alter patients' perceptions and cognitions of bodily symptoms that occur normally in everyone. (39) In some syndromes, changes have been found in peripheral nervous function associated with visceral hypersensitivity in irritable bowel syndrome (58), and in autonomic and neuroendocrine function in fibromyalgia. (59) Alexithymia, or the inability to express emotions in words, may be neurologically based, as are the depressive syndromes, and both show features of somatization. (40) When depression responds to medications physical symptoms often abate. - Behaviorists maintain that behavior is often unconscious, adaptive and perpetuated by environmental factors. Somatization behaviors might be an adaptation to family dynamics (5) or social factors such as more attention from mom or disability compensation. The behavior may be helpful at first but cause serious negative results such as MUS syndromes if it persists too long. - Cultures attribute specific meanings to symptoms, and the associated beliefs and attitudes sometimes lead patients to generalize and dramatize somatic complaints. (40, 41) - Violence, particularly sexual abuse, is strongly associated with moderate to severe MUS. Among women with chronic pelvic pain and functional gastroenterological disorders and in patients with chronic pain disorders the frequency of past abuse has been as high as 50%. (42, 43) Neurobiological, (44) behavioral, cultural and psychodynamic mechanisms likely contribute to this association. For women in abusive relationships body symptoms may serve the purpose of reducing the abuse (an abuser may refrain from mistreating his ill partner). At the same time symptoms may serve as a \"cry for help,\" because physical symptoms allow her to seek care and emotional support from a physician. ***module=31 page=04_0.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 04_2.htm Focus dialogue on function Compassionate interviews that address the multifactorial origin of symptoms, the importance of mind-body connections and focus on improving patients' functioning are most effective in discovering the full panoply of symptoms and their psychosocial context. If dialogue focuses on finding a cause for symptoms and fixing that cause, patients' condition seldom improves. Current evidence about the interactional dynamics peculiar to MUS suggests that utilizing this deeply imbedded \"find it and fix it\" concept in conversation about unexplainable symptoms undermines therapeutic aspects of the physician-patient relationship. In contrast, helpful dialogue conveys the notions that symptoms derive from many sources, that seldom does an identifiable single cause or \"broken part\" exist, that efforts to distinguish \"mind\" contibutions to symptoms from \"body\" contributions are fruitless and that the physician will strive to help the patient function well in spite of symptoms.(m3) Further, when patients and clinicians tacitly agree to think and work as if mind and body are separate, this agreement not only contributes to worsening symptoms and to costly fruitless interventions, but also threatens physicians' sense of competence. In the sections below, we present communication strategies shown to be helpful in patients who suffer from unexplainable symptoms. Diagnostic interviews become therapeutic conversations when they benefit from strategies for empathically introducing current scientific thinking about symptom development in \"Western\" terms. Use of these strategies assists in the resolution of mild MUS symptoms, minimizes or prevents the escalation from a \"moderate\" syndrome to a \"severe\" one, and helps patients function better so they can live fruitful lives despite symptoms. ***module=31 page=04_2.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_0.htm ESTABLISH A POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS Conducting a survey of all symptoms, asking patients to prioritize symptom importance and ascertaining the psychosocial context of symptoms help to establish a positive diagnosis of MUS, and also help to avoid entering a cycle of fruitless diagnostic testing and unsatisfactory symptomatic treatments. Opening interviews with a survey of problems and setting priorities for addressing them is generally helpful. (Module 7) However, when patients complain of multiple symptoms of equal importance in unrelated systems, this is a clue that you should consider MUS syndromes. Taking a thorough psychosocial history often reveals important clues. Symptoms may begin or worsen during a stressful time, such as the loss of a loved one, a job, a dream - or on the anniversary of an important loss. Ask directly, \"how stressful is your life these days?\" Ask about mood - about 50% of patients with depression develop somatic symptoms. Ask patients, \"What worries you most about (the symptoms)what do you think (the symptoms) might mean?\" Perhaps a co-worker just died with similar symptoms. Ask if anything really bad, such as physical or sexual abuse ever occurred or is present in their lives. Ask about past or present substance abuse, or self-medication attempts to lessen symptoms. Find out about chaotic or conflicted relationships. Each of these factors contributes to worrying and amplifying symptoms and adds to distress about what symptoms might mean. In the absence of physical findings related to the symptoms, obtaining simple screening laboratory tests is appropriate. Wait for these results and talk with patients and examine them again. Symptoms of mild MUS may diminish as time passes (6) and you express your concern and caring for the patient. ***module=31 page=05_0.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_1.htm Vigorous testing seldom eliminates uncertainty Compared with elusive organic diseases that may present with symptoms related to many organ systems, MUS is much more common. Vigorous and repetitive testing usually fails to establish a firm diagnosis, and often worsens symptoms in patients with MUS. In cases where symptoms persist, thinking of elusive or rare illnesses like Wilson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Lyme disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, porphyria, and celiac sprue is appropriate. Further, other diseases like carcinoma of the head of the pancreas, subdural hematoma, and ulcerative colitis can present with prominent psychosocial features. Repeating physical exams and reviews of symptoms not only reassures physicians, but is therapeutic for MUS. Restrain from repeating tests and ordering consultations when the probability of negative results is high, as this may worsen the symptoms of MUS patients. Of course patients with serious physical illnesses may have prominent psychosocial symptoms, so physicians must frequently live with uncertainty during weeks or months of repeated exams and interviews. Remember that moderate to severe MUS is far more prevalent than the diseases with which it is often confused. Record your thinking and document your interventions, because without careful tracking you will be tempted to repeat unnecessary tests and fail to undertake therapeutic interventions that may help the patient with MUS. It is likely that the sooner appropriate interventions are begun, the more likely patients with MUS are to stabilize or improve. ***module=31 page=05_1.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_2.htm The differ from MUS Factitious disorders and malingering (49) are rare, sometimes confused with MUS, and require different approaches. Factitious disorder (FD) Patients with FD intentionally produce organic disease or feign psychological signs or symptoms for the purpose of assuming the sick role, without discernible external incentive. Unlike MUS, in FD the symptoms are intentionally produced or feigned. Unlike MUS, FD is quite rare in primary care. If you suspect FD, consult a mental health colleague. Respectfully discuss with the patient the facts on which you base your concerns, and arrange a referral. Malingering Malingering patients do not produce organic disease but they do feign or exaggerate physical or psychological symptoms. External incentives such as obtaining financial compensation, seeking drugs or evading criminal prosecution are discernible. Respectfully communicate your awareness that your exams and tests indicate no serious basis for the symptoms. It may be helpful to provide a face-saving mechanism for the patient to discard the symptoms by suggesting that patients with similar problems usually recover after a certain procedure is performed, or a particular length of time has passed. Respectful refusal to prescribe drugs, sign forms or abet the situation is a proper professional response. Accusations, stern warnings or threats of exposure never help the patient or the situation. ***module=31 page=05_2.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_3.htm Common co-morbidities with MUS in primary care Most patients with moderate to severe MUS have one or more co-morbid conditions, such as symptomatic organic disease or mental health disorders. Trauma, personality factors and psychological stress not only contribute to the development of MUS (above), but to the genesis of other disorders, particularly mental health conditions. Organic illnesses exaggerate the effects of the above factors. Patients may be in relationship with other professionals and alternative medicine providers for these conditions. Coordinate your care with that of other providers. ***module=31 page=05_3.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_31.htm Many patients with MUS also suffer from organic disease Patients with symptomatic organic disease who also develop MUS pose a diagnostic challenge. For example, the patient who is known to have epilepsy may also have conversion seizures (non-epileptic seizures) not recognized as part of MUS, or the patient who has coronary artery disease may have non-cardiac chest pain and not be appropriately treated for MUS. The patient with MUS may develop new organic disease such as pulmonary embolism or appendicitis, and MUS treatment should be continued in parallel with other interventions because without MUS treatment, excessive testing and potentially harmful treatments for other conditions will ensue. ***module=31 page=05_31.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_32.htm Depression and MUS occur together, but are distinguishable Many patients with MUS have symptoms of depression, and we repeat that MUS is NOT a form of undiagnosed depression. Adding to potential confusion, many patients with MUS do meet criteria for a parallel diagnosis of depression. Appropriate treatment of depression may reduce the number of somatic concerns, but MUS treatment should continue. ***module=31 page=05_32.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_33.htm Provide treatment for co-existing panic disorder MUS is frequently associated with panic disorder, so ask MUS patients about panic attacks (Module 26). Effective treatment of panic disorder leads to a 30% - 40% reduction of symptoms in patients with moderate to severe MUS. ***module=31 page=05_33.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_34.htm Refer patients with post traumatic stress disorder Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with MUS, and some reports show that severe MUS may be 90 times more likely in people with PTSD than in those without it. In exploring the depth and breadth of patients' symptoms, be alert to hints about past or present traumatic situations, such as abusive relationships (Modules 28, 13), cult membership or service in a war zone, and seek consultative help. ***module=31 page=05_34.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_35.htm Refer patients with personality disorders to mental health providers One of two typical events may signal the presence of personality disorder in patients with moderate to severe MUS. The first is failure to stabilize or improve with use of the communication and interaction strategies we outline above and below. Secondly, when patients' attitudinal and behavioral problems extend to a broad range of personal and social situations, their illness may be complicated by a personality disorder. Treatment for personality disorder is not in the purview of primary care providers. However, consultation or co-management with psychiatrists can greatly help in coping with patients' challenging styles and painful and distressing behaviors. Further, consultative help in detecting and managing caregivers' own strong reactions to these challenges (negative counter transference) improves care of patients with concurrent disorders. ***module=31 page=05_35.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 05_36.htm Always obtain consultation for patients with substance abuse Co-existing substance abuse is frequent in patients with MUS, especially in those with chronic pain, and interventions for MUS will surely fail unless substance abuse problems are managed in parallel. There are many \"red flags\" that may signal a co-existing substance abuse disorder. These include the following: a) more concern about the drug than the problem, b) claims of multiple medication sensitivities, c) claims of inability to take generic drugs, d) refusal of diagnostic work-up or consultation, e) sophisticated knowledge of drugs, f) claims by the patient that you are the only one that can help him or her, g) claims of lost prescriptions. Refer patients with MUS and substance abuse disorders to one of the available community resources. (Modules 29 and 30) ***module=31 page=05_36.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 06_0.htm MANAGEMENT OF PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE MUS Most of the MUS treatment described herein derives from a randomized controlled trial of 206 primary care patients with moderate to severe MUS. (50) The treatment group showed clear improvements in mental health, depression and physical disability, and decreased use of narcotics and benzodiazepines. Additionally, this study demonstrated higher satisfaction with the provider-patient relationship, increased use of full-dose antidepressants and no cost increase, when comparing treatment patients to controls. (55) A recent study in a different population in Israel using a similar approach demonstrated decline in hospital visits, healthcare expenditures and mortality. (56) MUS is the prototype illness in which the physician is treatment. (Module 3) This treatment is not intuitive, however. Becoming effective requires utilizing the communication principles outlined in prior modules, particularly Module 9 (patient perspective), and Modules 5, 6, 13, and 14 (patient-centeredness, relationship building and non-verbal communication). Management includes thoughtful relationship-building and negotiated agreement not only about goals of treatment, but also about patients' responsibility for active participation. Without active patient involvement, treatment cannot be effective. Providing information as described in Module 10 increases the likelihood of patients' participation by helping them understand the basis of MUS and the rationale for each aspect of diagnostic study, treatment interventions, consultations and prescriptions. ***module=31 page=06_0.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 07_0.htm RELATIONSHIP: THE FOUNDATION OF TREATMENT Patients with MUS often are more concerned, angry, or sad about their symptoms than other patients, and they tend to mistrust clinicians because of previous negative experiences or because of worry about undiagnosed organic disease. Effective physicians make special efforts to listen attentively, seek to understand the patient's life situation and accept patients as they are, without judgment or prejudice. In spite of patients' negativity, anxiety, sadness or even their questions about the physician's competence and ideas, they are willing to advocate for patients and seek consultative assistance. They negotiate and compromise rather than demand and order. (51) These physicians are genuinely curious, respond to patients' challenges non-defensively, and are also able to set limits. Nevertheless, effective physicians are aware of professional boundaries (Module 41) and constantly setting limits. ***module=31 page=07_0.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 07_1.htm Interactional dynamics can provoke poor behavior and burnout Patients' need for \"cure\" and physicians' inability to provide it generates distrust, challenging interactions and inappropriate physician behaviors and comments. Patients with moderate to severe MUS believe that a body part is broken, that a really competent physician would find a cure (drug or surgery), and that caregivers should not \"mess with\" their minds. Neither the belief system nor the symptoms respond to simple and rational explanations and remedies, so frustration and distrust mounts for both persons. Setting up a partnership and securing patients' active participation is far more challenging than usual, and physicians perceive patients as uncooperative and demanding. These dynamics inevitably lead to negative emotional reactions that can be harmful to patients and lead to provider burnout. Success requires that physicians examine their own feelings and remind themselves of the patient's suffering. Lack of progress is not due to willful refusal to listen to helpful advice, or a negative reflection on your skills. When caring for patients with MUS, use consultants and other resources to help avoid maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance, inappropriate jesting, being overly controlling or inappropriately passive. When frustrated or angry with a relationship most physicians have difficulty expressing genuine empathy. Self-awareness about these feelings, and practice with skills will make it easier to voice helpful statements such as: \"I will do my best to help you to feel better.\" \"I am impressed that you can work (or, get out and around, or even make it to the office, etc) with the symptoms you have- you have a strong constitution.\" \"you and I have different ideas about why you have these symptoms; let's talk about them together.\" \"I sense your frustration that I'm not ordering another MRI at this time.\" \"Let's talk about how you can function better with treatments for this pain that do not involve drugs like oxycodone, which would not be appropriate for me to prescribe.\" \"You are worried that your condition might be serious.\" \"I can see how you would feel so distressed.\" \"I see you've been through a lot. Thank you for sharing so much about your situation with me.\" ***module=31 page=07_1.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 07_2.htm Set limits and routines to emphasize function, not symptoms Establish regular visits and a routine for visits, and avoid unscheduled visits. Consistently emphasize interest in function rather than symptom. Plan regular, time-contingent visits, rather than ad-hoc visits based on the patient's complaints. This shows that you are more interested in patients than in their symptoms and brings the focus more to improvements in functions than change in symptoms. Schedule weekly visits until the patient stabilizes and begins to make progress. Progressively lengthen visit intervals as tolerated, and shorten intervals during times of crises. Avoid reinforcing crises by discouraging unscheduled visits and supplementing regular visits with 3 to 5 minute phone calls. Establish a consistent visit routine. Once a diagnosis of MUS is established and an initial plan developed, limit follow-up visits to 10-20 minutes. Start with a brief, open-ended, patient-centered update that focuses on the elements described in the following sections, and then perform a limited physical exam. Monitor for potential new diagnoses and integrate the treatment of co-morbid chronic disease like diabetes and hypertension with the treatment of MUS. ***module=31 page=07_2.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 09_1.htm PREVENTION/RESOLUTION Mounting that a predisposed patient (see \"Causes of MUS\") may be \"turned into a somatizer\" if the physician ignores, minimizes or fails to recognize the verbal and nonverbal cues to the emotions that signal the extent of the patient's suffering. (57) Resolution of mild MUS symptoms can be facilitated by physicians who display sensitivity to the intensity of patients' suffering. This is a complex process in interviews with the many MUS patients who do not forthrightly name or declare their anxiety, concerns, and worries, and often fail to describe their suffering in the language of emotions or feelings. It is easy for physicians to attend primarily to the physical descriptors, but you must be alert and responsive to clues that patients give when they describe their physical symptoms, lest you unwittingly \"collude\" with the patient, ignore the suffering and thus delay symptom resolution. Physicians who use the \"gathering information\" skills (Modules 5, 8), \"emotion-handling\"(Module 5) and attend thoughtfully to the \"patient's perspective\" (Modules 5, 9) demonstrate to their patients their acknowledgement and understanding of the suffering induced by the symptom(s). Regular use of NURS (name, understand, respect and support, as described in Module 5) along with a full exploration of not only the physical symptoms themselves (\"bio-\"), but most importantly the full emotional and social context (\"-psychosocial\") assists in the resolution of mild MUS symptoms, the attenuation of moderate symptoms, and the preparation of more seriously afflicted patients for interventions in the \"Education, Commitment, Goals and Negotiation\" paradigm outlined in the \"Treatment Protocol\" section, above. Dr. Smith highlights the therapeutic efficacy of these basic skills in the following videos that show a patient with different symptoms at office visits several months apart. (Prevention/Resolution). EDUCATION, COMMITMENT, GOALS, NEGOTIATION (ECGN) Experimental work and clinical experience suggests that instituting 4 essential treatment elements for patients with MUS is useful: education, commitment, goals and negotiation. Help patients understand that the symptoms and findings are definitely not due to a life-threatening process, that their problem has a name, that the symptoms are not \"in your head\", and that their functioning can be improved despite the symptoms' apparent intractability. Obtain a commitment to become an active participant by keeping a dairy, attending physical therapy, exercising, seeing consultants and so on. Agree on achievable long-term and short-term goals so that progress can be assessed and celebrated. During empathic, respectful and ongoing dialogue, work towards eventual agreement on specific elements, such as treatment of concomitant mental health problems, active participation in physical therapy, and relaxation or other exercises, use of non-addicting medications, involvement of a family member and limits on self-referral. ***module=31 page=08_0.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 08_1.htm Explain your understanding, and respond to patients' perspectives The goal of education is for patients to understand their condition- simple reassurance is ineffective. Be optimistic and realistic\"it is possible to manage symptoms and function better, but not possible to cure the illness.\" Elicit patients' ideas about what explains their symptoms and listen to their concerns about what that means for the future (Module 9). Confidently convey to patients that their symptoms and findings do not indicate life-threatening disease and that further testing would not be helpful at this time. Assure them that you believe their problems are real and not \"in your head.\" Name the condition - use any somatic disorder for which the symptoms meet criteria, or a descriptive name like chronic low back pain. Most patients understand that stress can lead to bodily symptoms, and you can further explain that their past history of abuse, current stresses or depression produces chronic adrenalin release and muscle spasms, or that chemical imbalances related to depression contribute to increased perception of pain. Share evidence that antidepressants are better than narcotics and tranquilizers for long-term treatment of MUS. Give an appropriate, plausible mechanism for the symptoms, but remind patients that many mysteries remain about mind-body connections. ***module=31 page=08_1.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 08_11.htm Information strategies Conversations might include the following elements to legitimize some of patients' thinking and track associations that could be useful. - \"The good news is that you do not have a life threatening disease and more tests would not add to our certainty right now.\" - \"You have (name the condition), and I have treated other patients with this condition.\" - \"This is probably caused by, or at least exaggerated by (e.g., abnormal wiring in the brain or abnormal muscle contractions).\" - \"We are unlikely to ever fully understand how this works, and we are unlikely to cure it, but you and I can work together to move it from the center of your life \" - \"I see that you are still worried that (e.g. ozone, high-tension wires, microwaves, yeasts) might be causing your troubles, and I know other people blame those things too; however, current evidence suggests (repeat your previous explanations), and I want to keep working at what has been shown to be helpful, so that you can manage better.\" - \"You are suffering terribly. One thing that would help you and me monitor progress and discover things we might change would be a diary. Would you be willing to write down something about your symptoms each day? Then we can look it over together.\" ***module=31 page=08_11.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 08_2.htm Help patients become active partners in treatment Patients will not improve unless they commit to active participation in treatment. Physicians and patients are both aware of remarkable advances in biomedicine, and eager to find a broken mechanism that might be simply fixed, usually with a drug or procedure. When finding and fixing is not possible, managing patients' symptoms and health requires active participation from both parties. Just as patients with severe organic illnesses who have no specific treatment options left must manage medications well, treat depression, eat well, exercise when possible and keep up their social relationships, patients with MUS must take responsibility for active participation in their non-specific treatments or neither their function nor their symptoms will improve. Ask patients for an explicit commitment to following plans developed jointly. Anticipate out loud that their efforts will be rewarded in the short and long term, but that since medicine cannot find a broken part, the task is to find ways to improve function. Avoid statements that blame the patient for lack of progress, and show appreciation for any small victories. For physicians, mindfully maintaining an empathic stance and expressing curiosity, respect and appreciation of patients' positive qualities when progress is absent or fleeting is challenging, sometimes maddening, and yet is one key to their patients' success. ***module=31 page=08_2.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 08_21.htm Commitment strategies Conversations might include the following elements to underscore the need for active commitment and partnership in improving function. - \"We have treatment that works, but you and I will have to work hard at it together. It is going to be a lot of work, probably harder than you have ever worked on your health, but it will be worth it.\" - \"Are you on board with this, and willing to carry out your part?\" - \"It's hard to keep a diary (go to exercise class, walk every day, etc), and usually takes many tries to be successful- just like losing weight or stopping smoking. Let's look for simple steps in the right direction that you know are likely to work for you.\" - \"We were both optimistic about taking that next step, but something got in the way. Tell me about what happened for you .Let's look in your diary for clues.\" - \"Are you really committed to walking? On a 1-10 scale (where 1 is not at all and 10 is total commitment), where would you put yourself\" \"What would it take to help you do better?\" - \"You seem discouraged. I know your life is miserable- from what I've seen, I think you have the strength to keep at this. I know you could be better. What do you think?\" ***module=31 page=08_21.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 08_3.htm Establish goals and assess progress against the goals Patients expect the clinician to have the \"answers\" and may be resistant to a process of joint goal-setting. Engage patients in setting both long-term goals and short term goals, so that they can assess and celebrate progress. Help MUS patients remember that many illnesses, such as diabetes, hardening of arteries or a stroke are not curable. Like these patients, patients with MUS need to establish realistic long term goals to keep functioning, or improve functioning after setbacks. Living with an incurable illness is hard work and people function better if they decide to pursue goals that they know may have positive effects. Managing blood sugar, avoiding blindness, preventing another stroke, learning to walk or talk again are realistic yet difficult goals. Examples of realistic long-term goals for MUS patients are improved work and school record, relationships, mental health, physical and emotional function, and somewhat improved symptoms. Achievement of long term goals depends on skill and creativity at negotiating realistic short-term goals. These are the specific day-to-day, week-to-week behaviors that could eventually lead to the long-term success. Exercise, meditation, diminishing reliance on addictive medications, and visiting consultants are examples. Work with patients to obtain their commitment to work on a limited number of goals. Devise protocols and dairies that enable people to achieve and measure small successes by the following visit. ***module=31 page=08_3.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 08_31.htm \"Failures\" Failure to achieve goals is common and predictable, but not a failure of the overall treatment plan. Patients cannot achieve goals unless they make a real commitment to do so. Many failures are due to unexpressed ambivalence that results in forced or \"socially acceptable\" agreement to do a task, or a weak commitment to it. Patients have difficulty disclosing their ambivalence or reluctance, or may be unaware of it until after the visit. Unanticipated larger or smaller obstacles, such as a partner's disagreement, a new crisis, a sick pet or a snowstorm explain other failures. Keeping an \"eye on the prize\" is essential but difficult when life is complicated by so many elements that hamper even small successes. The physician's role is to persist at examining and reviewing the total picture, to revise short term goals so that success is possible, and to express hope, empathy and respect. ***module=31 page=08_31.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 08_32.htm Goal-setting strategies Focus the conversation. Keep it practical. Examine the total context. Review any homework. Develop new short-term goals to be achieved by the next visit. Dialogue about goal-setting will often include statements and questions like the following: \"What are some of the things you would like to be doing if you weren't feeling so badly?\" \"What two to three things could you commit to doing over the next one to two weeks?\" \"Let's review your homework that we agreed on at the last visit.\" \"You thought that meditating for 5 minutes twice a day would be possible for you. What has gotten in the way?\" \"It seemed that you were ready to walk for 15 minutes twice daily at your last visit. Looking at the dairy, we can see that you had some success, but not at all what we anticipated. Tell me what happened?\" \"I know you were reluctant to cut back on your oxycodone prescription. I'm interested in reviewing the pain scores in your dairy. Has anything else changed over the past two weeks since I cut back your prescription?\" ***module=31 page=08_32.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 08_4.htm Negotiation of a specific treatment plan Reach agreement on an individualized specific treatment plan. The key aspects of a fruitful negotiation process include the above-described elements of educating, goal-setting and obtaining commitment. The negotiation process begins as the physician establishes the diagnosis. A plan may take several visits to complete and review and modification of the plan should occur at each visit. In addition to the skills discussed regarding perspectives, exploration and information sharing, physicians will use skills delineated in Module 11 and Module 17 in seeking agreement on a specific plan. For typical patients with moderate to severe MUS, plans usually include some combination of the following actions: - treatment of co-morbid depression and/or anxiety with full dose anti-depressants - substitution of non-addicting medications for addicting ones to treat symptoms - simple physical therapy, exercise or relaxation with consultative assistance when necessary - agreement that the patient will not self-refer to other providers and will take only the medications prescribed in this relationship - involvement of a significant family member. ***module=31 page=08_4.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 08_41.htm Negotiation strategies During visits, review the plans and negotiate any new elements. Use written contracts to emphasize the importance of the plan's elements and the partnership. Dialogue about treatment plans will often include statements like the following: - \"Anybody who has been through what you have been through would be anxious or depressed. We have found that treating depression and anxiety also help significantly to improve symptoms like yours.\" - \"The medications you are now taking are addicting and as you have seen are not very effective in the long-term... Antidepressants are very effective pain medications\" - \"With your permission, I would like to try to slowly wean you off X and start you on Y Do not worry. We will go very slowly. My goal is to help you get better, not to get worse.\" - \"I will go over some specific exercises that have been very helpful for other patients.\" - \"Before you go to the ER, see other doctors about these problems, change the doses of your medications, or start other medicines, please discuss your ideas with me.\" - \"Bring your (supportive family member) to your next visit.\" - \"So that we know we are in full agreement about the plans, I'm going to write them out, review them carefully with you and ask you to sign them. That way we'll have something in writing to reference in our work together.\" - \"How does this (any of the above statements) sound to you?\" - \"Can we agree to make (any of the above statements) part of your treatment plan?\" ***module=31 MD Dr. Dwamena comments on the videos you are about to see in which Dr. Smith works with a patient with moderate to severe MUS ***module=31 page=09_2.htm*** Module: Page: 08_5.htm Consultation and Hospitalization Cultivate relationships with consultants who understand the dynamics of MUS, who can assist you with the frequent interactional and emotional problems and who can help you add to your expertise and facility with managing these complex patients. Clinicians often need the help of mental health providers and other specialists to perform diagnostic tests or to assist with co-morbid problems or with refractory MUS cases. Partner with consultants who will curtail investigation after an appropriate but not necessarily exhaustive assessment, and who will clearly convey to the patient that no new disease was found. Inform consultants that your patient has or may have MUS so that they can avoid inadvertent reinforcement of the patient's fears of undiagnosed organic disease. Patients may worry that referral means abandonment and need explicit reassurance of your continuing involvement. Hospitalize patients with psychiatric or physical instability, but not for treatment of symptoms. ***module=31 page=08_5.htm*** Module: 31 | Page: 09_3.htm Ms. A (real patient) Patients with multiple somatic symptoms develop them over time, and many factors contribute to their onset and maintenance. A careful and focused interview can help you understand how development, family environment, social, financial, and cultural factors, personality and affect can interweave to affect the expression of multiple symptoms. This understanding gives you the basis for designing effective therapeutic interventions. Dennis Novack and Carol Landau created the \"Problem Patient Clinic\" (45) (officially called the \"Medical Psychological Consultation Clinic,\") as a consultative resource and learning experience for residents at Rhode Island Hospital. With residents working alongside them, every week for over 12 years they saw patients who had multiple symptoms for which organic disease could not be identified. The team interviewed these patients from one to three times, occasionally making home visits, and then contacted the referring physician with advice on how to manage the patients more effectively. This approach had many elements in common with the \"Educate, Commitment, Negotiate, Goals\" paradigm (above), had a positive impact on patient outcomes, and helped physicians feel less frustrated in caring for these complex patients. In the following videos, Drs. Novack, Landau and their resident team work with Mrs. A, an actual patient referred to their clinic. Dr. Novack poses questions after each segment that can help you focus your thinking about the genesis and treatment of multiple somatic symptoms. After each segment and set of questions, you might want to pause, reflect, and write down your thoughts. It would be helpful to view these video segments with colleagues, as rich discussions and new understanding can emerge. At the end, you should have a better idea of how and why Mrs. A developed her symptoms, what factors keep them going, and what you could do if you were caring for her to help her improve her symptoms and and her quality of life. ***module=31 page=09_3.htm*** Module: CHECKLIST Focus on relationship - Explore psychosocial context (use direct open-ended request) - Ask about emotions (seek deeper understanding) - Ask for patient's perspective (use direct open-ended request) - Empathic response to emotions, suffering - Commit to partnership - Negotiate visit limits (length and frequency) - Discourage unscheduled visits Education - Tell a name for condition - Tell how condition works (pathophysiology) - Tell that stress is an important factor - Tell that cure is unlikely - Tell that improvement in function is likely - Ask patient's perspectives - Tell that this condition is not life-threatening - Tell why you limit testing Commitment - Ask for commitment to partnership - Tell patient that commitment assures progress - Check commitment and confidence using 1-10 scales - Congratulate patient for success, even small success Goals - Ask about long-term goals and values - Ask for short term action plans - Review progress toward goals - Ask about impediments to progress - Emphasize functional improvement, not symptom improvement Negotiation - Negotiate visit limits (length and frequency) - Name co-morbid conditions, and - Establish agreement to treat co-morbidities - Establish contracts re other providers and emergency room visits - Establish contracts re addictive substances and prescriptions - Involve a significant family member - Emphasize adherence to schedules ***module=31 page=10_0.htm*** Module: 31 | Groleau D, Looper KJ, Dao MD.

How would you begin such a conversation? - What are your goals when you begin to talk with patients about advance care planning? - What patient questions or responses might be most unsettling to hear as you begin to talk about advance care planning? - What do patients want from advance care planning conversations? What might their goals be? - How have your experiences (personal or professional) with discussing living and/or dying with a terminal illness prepared you for advance planning talks? - How might you respond when a patient with a life-limiting illness asks, \"I am not dying, am I page=0_5_Questions.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 0_6_Principles.htm Key Principles: - Advance care planning includes goals of care for both the future and the present. - Advance care planning conversations reassure patients, strengthen relationships, diminish potential family conflicts, and guide your use of medical therapies. - Discuss patients' values, goals, and standards for quality of life; and explore what treatments they are willing to endure to meet these standards. - Explore your personal comfort level so that you will be able to appreciate and empathize with patients' emotions. - Attempt to begin advance care planning conversations during a time of health. ***module=32 page=0_6_Principles.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 0_7_Goals.htm Learning goals: At the conclusion of this module, you will be able to: - Demonstrate a focus on patient's values and goals (rather than on treatment options) for advance care planning (ACP). - Describe nine ways that ACP benefits patients and/or their healthcare providers. - Describe key differences among advance care planning, living wills, durable power of attorney, and DNR orders. - Demonstrate use of the \"six-step approach\" for ACP (in inpatient or outpatient setting). ***module=32 page=0_7_Goals.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 1_00.htm INTRODUCTION This module describes advance care planning (ACP) concepts and skills to encourage you to enter into ACP conversations. Conversations could be during a time of health in the office setting, or during the end-of-life in the hospital setting. We invite you to reflect on your experience with end-of-life issues and how these ease or retard your initiation and facilitation of ACP conversations. What is Advance Care Planning? (1) Advance care planning is a conversation that explores patients' current and future healthcare goals and values, and their directives about future options if they should lack the capacity to decide for themselves.Advance care planning (ACP) helps patients and their physicians clarify the patient's healthcare preferences, both in current health and near the end of life. Understanding this, the physician can recommend treatments that are appropriate to the patient's goals. Physicians need to initiate and facilitate these ongoing conversations in both office and hospital settings in order to generate a \"map\" of the patient's understanding and expectations for quality of life under different circumstances. Advance care planning includes both advance directive planning, which addresses future incapacitation, and goals of care, which addresses the patient's current health situation.(2) There are two types of advance directives:proxy directives and instructional directives. Goals of care include discussions about resuscitation preferences (DNR orders) and other treatment options in patients with life-limiting illnesses. We discuss these terms below. We emphasize first exploring patients' values and goals, to enable you to offer and negotiate treatment options that honor their wishes, and secondly to debunk the myth that advance directives equate to convincing patients to enter a \"do not treat\" mode. Kate is a medical student observing at Dr. M's primary care office. While taking the family history of a new patient, they learn that both parents died of chronic illnesses. Dr. M says, \"I'm wondering about the end-of-life care your parents received and if you are familiar with advance care planning?\" This surprises Kate as the patient is only 65-years-old and seems in good health. ***module=32 page=1_00.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 1_10.htm Begin early, document Introduce advance care planning during a time of health. A documented series of conversations based on patients' individual circumstances has both clinical and legal merit. Ideally, advance care planning is an ongoing conversation that begins during a time of health when patients are less vulnerable and less emotionally charged. This allows patients time to clarify their values and learn more about treatment options. Often patients have not thought much about getting sicker or what is most important to them as they get sicker. In this situation, a physician's role is to engage patients in thinking about what is most important should their time be limited. Two useful tools are Five Wishes, which is discussed below, and a Values History, which can be found at the University of Mexico Institute for Ethics website: [http://hsc.unm.edu/ethics/advdir/vhform_eng.shtml]While Five Wishes is brief and direct, The Values History is in-depth questionnaire available in English or Spanish that can be used by the patient herself, among family members, or with a provider to prompt reflection prior to or during hospitalization. Kate notices that Dr. M focuses the conversation on clarifying medical terms rather than discussing specific treatment options. He explores quality of life issues and relates them to the patient's family experiences. When the patient said, \"I don't want to be tied to machines because they never seem to work,\" Dr. M asked her to \"say more\" about her perceptions. Further dialog clarified that the patient views machines as prolonging lost causes, as in the case with her parents. What she really doesn't want, however, are ineffective treatments. Dr. M moves on and asks the patient if she has designated anyone to be her health care power of attorney, in the event that she can no longer make health care decisions for herself? The patient responds, \"No,\" and Dr. M suggests doing so, as well as discussing with that person her feelings and standards regarding quality of life issues. Kate notes that the conversation lasts about 5 minutes and wonders what Dr. M's motives were for initiating it. ***module=32 page=1_10.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 1_20.htm Benefits for Patients Through conversation about ACP, patients learn about options, adjust expectations, clarify their values, gain autonomy and engage their loved ones. Benefits of advance care planning include the following: - Patients can clarify their own values, and consider their feelings about what matters to them at the end-of-life. - Patients who talk about advance care planning help their loved ones and clinicians understand their goals, so that their loved ones and healthcare providers can make decisions consistent with their values. - Patients learn more about what to expect as they approach dying, and about the options for life sustaining treatment and/or palliative care. - Patients can develop a sense of control, and obtain assurance that their clinicians will partner with them so that they might die in a manner consistent with their preferences. (21) ***module=32 page=1_20.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 1_30.htm Additional benefits Conversations can address both medical and non-medical goals, deepen clinician-patient relationships, and as death comes closer, prepare the patient, ease conflicts and facilitate decision-making (4). Additional benefits may be less directly related to medical treatments: - Patients may relieve their loved ones of the burden of decision-making. Family members who have had conversations with their loved one s report less stress associated with the decision-making and more certainty that they are doing what their loved ones would have wanted. - Patients may better prepare themselves for death through these conversations, and find opportunity to reflect more deeply about their life's meaning or accomplishments. Clinicians benefit from engaging patients in advance care planning in the following ways: - Assuring patients that their wishes will be respected increases trust and communication. - Decreasing conflicts with family members because the clinician can refer back to what the patient had said she would want in this kind of situation. - Prior advance care planning conversations will allow the physician to help surrogates make difficult decisions when patients lose their decision-making capacity (5). Kate asks whether Dr. M talks to all his patients about advance care planning. He responds, \"Unfortunately, no, but I try to start the conversation in the office. Then, if the patient becomes ill, we both know we can resume at the bedside, even though it will be a much different type of conversation. I learned this the hard way when a chronic care patient landed in the hospital and lost mental functioning without any wishes outlined. Not only did the decision process literally tear the family apart, but knowing this patient as a person, I doubt that he would have agreed with the measures we took.\" Kate thought about her own family's tensions when her grandmother was dying of diabetes. With no health care power of attorney or ACP in place, her mother and uncle often fought over what care should be administered, sometimes contradicting themselves and confusing the staff. ***module=32 page=1_30.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 2_00.htm TYPES OF ADVANCE CARE CONVERSATIONS In health, conversations can focus on quality of life, fears about disability or end-of-life scenarios. With patients with serious chronic illnesses, but who are not yet \"dying\", you may focus more on goals and values and how treatment options may help meet these goals. Patients in good health benefit from selecting a healthcare proxy, and thinking about those conditions under which they would not want their life prolonged (e.g. persistent vegetative states). With older patients, who may have more serious chronic illnesses but are not yet \"dying\", clinicians should assure that a proxy has been chosen, and then help the patient specify which goals and values he thinks would be important if he becomes sicker. . Advance care planning is an opportunity for patients to indicate treatment preferences, but they may not have well-formed preferences. (6,7) Physicians can help patients discover and outline their preferences through careful exploration of values and goals. Sensing that Dr. M is open to more discussion about Advance Care Planning, Kate pushes a bit further.\"I heard you encouraging the last patient to appoint a health care power of attorney. What other issues or questions do you encourage patients to think about?\" Dr M. nodded and said, \"Well, of course it depends on the particular patient, but there is a resource called \"Five Wishes\" that many people find useful ( [http://www.agingwithdignity.org/5wishes.html]), which I have a copy of in my office.\" ***module=32 page=2_00.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 2_10.htm Questions patients want to consider as they become sicker There are a number of structured self-help manuals that patients and families can use to explore their values at the end-of-life. For example, the Veterans Administration has used \"Your life, Your choices\", an empirically validated workbook to walk individuals through the choices they are likely to face as they become sicker. (8) Another manual, entitled \"Five Wishes\" helps clarify who will be a proxy, and what patients value most as they think about dying. - Which person you want to make health care decisions for you when you can't make them. - The kind of medical treatment you want or don't want. - How comfortable you want to be. - How you want people to treat you. - What you want your loved ones to know. \"In the course of this conversation you can also explore what their fears and hopes are for chronic illnesses or end-of-life care, or what states they consider worse than death.\" In such discussions patients can consider whether there are treatments which they might wish to forgo, and about the circumstances in which they might forgo them. Additionally, health care providers can help patients to make the choices that are most likely to achieve their goals. ***module=32 page=2_10.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 2_20.htm Dialog near end-of-life Earlier advance care conversations simplify the transition to specific treatment planning in the final stages of illness. When patients progress to the final stages of illness, healthcare providers can use the groundwork from earlier discussions to make specific plans about what is done. In end-stage disease, after clinicians clarify the goals of care they will need to address specifically some common interventions, including \"code status\" or DNR orders.(10) We believe, however, that an emphasis on resuscitation is misguided. Patients do not understand the nature of cardiopulmonary resuscitation is, the slim chance of successful resuscitation or the spectrum of other implications. Thus we recommend that the conversation focus on patient goals rather than specific interventions. (11,12) [Back AL, Arnold RM, Tulsky JA. Mastering communication with seriously ill patients: Balancing honesty with empathy and hope.]Cambridge University Press. 2009 Kate asked, \"I also noticed that you spoke about specific terms involved with advance care planning. What were they again?\" Dr. M shared with her the handout that he had given the patient. \"Additional resources are available from the hospital, AARP, the American Bar Association, and on the internet.\" Kate glanced at the definitions that you find in the following sections.. ***module=32 page=2_20.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 3_00.htm ADVANCE DIRECTIVES Advance care directives are statements of a person's treatment preferences. Instructional directives specify treatment instructions. Proxy directives designate an alternate decision-maker. The advance directives aspect of the advance care planning process allow patients to instruct others regarding their preferences should they lose capacity to decide for themselves. Tulsky writes, \"Advance directives are not the same as DNR orders and generally do not provide instruction for specific circumstances. Rather, they should facilitate discussions of goals of care and consideration of all of the elements of quality at the end of life from symptom control to limitation of treatment\" (4). The two types of advance directives are proxy directives and instructional directives. Both types become active only if the patient has lost decision-making capacity. Proxy directives are straight-forward for patients to understand, and conversations about them are usually simple and direct. Proxy directives are also referred to as durable powers of attorney for healthcare, and patients designate whom they would like to make decisions in case of patient incapacity. In most states, health care providers cannot serve in this role, unless they are related to the patient. Furthermore, healthcare power of attorneys can be imbued with various levels of authority and decision making responsibilities. We emphasize that naming a proxy means that patients only surrender decision-making control if they are personally unable to function. Proxy directives do not indicate patients' wishes, preferences, or values, and so by themselves cannot provide information about specific treatments patients feel are appropriate to achieve their goals. Formulating discussions about values and goals with loved ones and providers into an instructional directive helps assure that treatment decisions made by the person designated in the proxy directive are consistent with the patient's preferences. ***module=32 page=3_00.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 3_10.htm The instructional directive-living will The instructional directive, also known as living will, specifies desired and prohibited treatments if the patient is incapacitated. Instructional directives, referred to as living wills, attempt to fill the gap between avowed goals and unpredictable illness states that occur when people are incapacitated. The directive identifies situations in which the patient would or would not want particular treatments. For example, an instructional directive might state, \"If I were permanently unconscious, or terminally ill, I would not want to undergo cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\" Another might say \"If my physicians think I am likely to die within a few months, I want medications (except for relief of pain or discomfort) discontinued, including antibiotics, and I do not want tube feedings or intravenous fluids.\" Directives are more or less specific about the scenarios and treatments desired or prohibited. We stress again that directives give scant information about patients' goals, hence the importance of initiating and documenting conversations that explore patients' wishes for what they would like to achieve, and sharing that information with family and loved ones. \"Thanks,\" said Kate. \"I'm guessing that bedside conversations with ill patients differ from what I saw today. How do you handle this if you have to start from scratch and the patient needs treatment?\" Dr. M took a deep breath and said, \"Well, there are six basic things I try to do: \"You seem to have a heightened interest in this topic, Kate. How about I give you some communication handouts I have and we can work together on the skills when we do rounds tomorrow?\" - Introduce the topic when all the right people are there and explain why I'm doing it now - Set the stage by checking patient's understanding of the illness and their current. prognosis. I may need to correct some misperceptions or add some information here. - This may be bad news, so I need to be careful to attend to the patient's emotions. - Elicit the patient's preferences, goals and fears about their disease progression. Given these values, I then can make a recommendation about what I think should be done to promote their goals and decrease their fears. - Identify who the proxy should be and the importance of communicating with them. - Clearly document the conversation while following all hospital and state policies. - Close the Conversation by thanking the patient for talking about a difficult topic and emphasize that we will routinely revisit their thoughts. ***module=32 page=3_10.htm*** Module: Page: 4_00.htm SEVEN SPECIFIC SKILLS FOR ACP CONVERSATIONS WITH ILL PATIENTS In ACP conversations you are both educator and facilitator. The key skills are: setting the context, exploring treatment goals, documenting the conversation, and extending appreciation to the patient. Responding to patients' emotions and assuring your own comfort with end-of-life issues contribute to success. Kate reviewed the list of seven skills that night and copied some of the suggested phrases on to index cards. Dr. M had mentioned that there were several patients admitted who might benefit from such conversations ***module=32 page=4_00.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 4_10.htm 1. Introduce the topic of ACP Arrange a calm setting, and do not deliver bad news at the same time as the ACP conversation. Take charge of making certain the setting is as calm and private as possible and that the people the patient wants are present. If you are in a hospital setting and not the patient's Primary Care Provider, try contacting the PCP to see if they have already begun a conversation with the patient or family. Having a nurse present is helpful as he can reiterate what you said after you leave. Explain why you are raising the topic of goals now (e.g., may relate to prognosis of illness, recent hospitalization, the fact that you always do this). Use the introductory moments to say that you want to help and support the patient through understanding her goals and helping her achieve them. As you may be talking about new information, periodically ask the patient for questions they might have. Finally, remember that you are talking about the possibility of dying and thus attend to any emotional reaction the patient may have. \"I talk with all my patients about what they would want if, god forbid they become sicker. What are your thoughts about this?\" \"I talk with all my patients about what are called living wills. What does that mean for you?\" ***module=32 page=4_10.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 4_20.htm 2. Set the stage for ACP discussion Check the patient's understanding of the prognosis. Reassure the patient that you believe death is not imminent (if this is true), and avoid false reassurance. Ascertain whether your patient understands the course of her illness and her prognosis at this time, because it is helpful to begin with a shared understanding of the current situation and what the future is likely to bring. Explain any treatments that are discussed in terms of the patient's experience and probable outcome. \"What is your understanding of your illness?\" \"What do you expect will happen in the future?\" \"As you think about the illness, what is the best and the worst that might happen?\" In some cases, you may find that the patient does not really understand her illness or prognosis. In these cases, we recommend that you defer talking about advance care planning and focus the conversation on providing information about the illness. Remember that this information may be heard as bad news (Module 33). Typically, it is best to separate bad news conversations from advance care planning, as this allows the patient time to understand what is wrong now, before having to decide what she would want done in the future. ***module=32 page=4_20.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 4_30.htm 3. Elicit Preferences Check goals, by asking \"Why this goal?\" and telling how you will support their goals. Ask patients to explain their goals for treatment, and probe for an understanding of what makes their life worth living and what personal goals they want to achieve. Alternatively, ask about their fears and what they would want to avoid. One way to begin such questioning is to explore their experiences with friends' or relatives' end of life care and to inquire how that experience impacts their perspective. \"What experience do you have of being with someone who was dying?\" \"Based on what you saw, what, for you, makes the difference between a good death and a bad death?\" \"What makes live worth living for you?\" \"What would be most important if your time was limited? What would you want to avoid?\" Another interviewing skill involves reversing the question in order to explore the same issue from a different perspective. For instance, after asking what does make life worth living for the patient, reverse the question and explore what situations they would find unacceptable (e.g., persistent vegetative state) and what risks they are willing to take to avoid such situations. \"What circumstances might there be in which you would find life not worth living?\" ***module=32 page=4_30.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 4_31.htm 3a. Check preferences for specific goals and treatments Guide discussion between values, specific treatments and information about treatments After developing your understanding of the patient's frame of reference for end of life care, you can continue by inquiring about both general goals and more specific treatment preferences, such as artificial nutrition and hydration. Revisiting specific treatments options is particularly important as the patient's circumstances continue to change. \"In terms of your own treatment, what are your thoughts about balancing quality of life with length of life? \" \"What are your thoughts about chemotherapy at this point?\" \"If you get sicker, how would you feel about coming back to the hospital?\" \"How would you feel about being put on machines? When patients state specific preferences about treatments, always ask \"why,\" or \"tell me more?\" Given that many patients do not understand the specific therapy (and its implications), the focus should be on the goals of treatment rather than the therapy itself. The underlying principle is to guide the discussion back and forth among preferences for specific treatments, information about the treatment, implications, and the patient's values. This ensures that the patient understands the implications of her decisions regarding specific treatments and the physician understands the patient's values. Identify what life situations the patient would find unacceptable (e.g. \"being a vegetable on a machine\"). \"I heard you say that you don't want treatment X. Tell me more about your thinking behind this so I know your specific reasons.\" \"In hearing about your reasons, is it safe to say that your goal is to avoid X as a long-term treatment?\" \"Under what circumstances might you be willing to receive X?\" ***module=32 page=4_31.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 4_32.htm 3b. Discuss probability and uncertainty Learn about how patients' confront uncertainty as you discuss various \"what if?\" scenarios. Treatment outcomes are seldom black and white. Discussing the probabilities inherent in medical treatment introduces uncertainty. Patients may not understand how doctors can not know what is going to happen, or they may find the uncertainty anxiety-provoking. Respond to patients' affect associated with discussions of uncertainty by using relationship building statements (Module 6). Listen for whether patients defer to family, physicians, religion or just laugh and ignore uncertainty, and help them use their resources for help with difficult decisions. Getting a sense of what the patient is willing to do in uncertain situations is helpful when making treatment recommendations. For example, a person who is risk averse may be unwilling to undergo high risk treatments that are unlikely to provide benefit. The decision making data suggest that physicians should frame the information in both positive and negative terms. (13,14) \"Sometimes you can not tell what is going to happen with treatment. Some people would want to keep trying even with a very low chance say 5% - that the treatment will work, while others say that if 95% of the time the treatment will not help, they do not want to go through it. What do you think about this?\" ***module=32 page=4_32.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 4_40.htm 4. Identify Proxy Check who will be proxy, and assure that patient is able to speak with her. Insure that your patient identifies a proxy, who becomes the spokesperson should the patient become unable to convey her preferences. Stress the need for the patient to communicate with her proxy both that she wants that person to be her proxy and about her goals of care and preferences for treatment. If the proxy choice is likely to be controversial, advise the patient to complete a legal durable power of attorney for health care. \"If something should happen to you and we could not talk to you about your wishes in more detail, who would you want to help me make these decisions? How much have you talked with him about this?\" ***module=32 page=4_40.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 4_50.htm 5. Document ACP conversations Write chart notes about your conversation. Tell your patient to share copies with other providers and have one handy at home. Be sure to document your conversation. If the patient is an in-patient, follow hospital policy. If you are in a hospital setting, fill out your \"code status\" form and also write a note documenting the discussion, the patient's thinking and what you both agreed upon. If an outpatient, make notes for the chart. Clearly state the context for the discussion, goals discussed and any decisions made or pending. At her next visit you may wish to read what you wrote as a way to establish that you are on the same page. At a future meeting the patient may bring a completed living will or a durable power of attorney for health care. (Many hospitals have these forms. If yours does you might give it to the patient after your conversation). Advise the patient to keep a copy of the form(s) at home and to give copies to all of her health care providers (in both outpatient and inpatient settings). Finally, remind her to discuss the form and the reasons for having it with her surrogates. ***module=32 page=4_50.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 4_60.htm 6. Close the ACP Conversation End with appreciation of your patients' participation, and stress their autonomy. Express your appreciation for their willingness to talk about the topic and emphasize your non-abandonment in their care. Offer yourself as form of support by giving a clear description of what you will do to meet patients' goals. Emphasize that you will be there and remain actively involved regardless of what goals they wish to pursue. \"I've heard you explain that A, B, and C are important goals to you. Is that correct? I want you to know that as your physician I will do X, Y, and Z in order to help you accomplish these goals and that I plan to stay actively involved in your care.\" Second, stress that this is lot to think about and it should be an on-going conversation. They don't need to make an immediate decision and can always change their mind. \"I want to thank you for helping me understand your values and goals. Have you talked to anyone else about these issues?\" \"I want to thank you for helping me understand your position if you should get sicker. It has been very helpful to me. I know that in the past, you have not given this very much thought. Would you be willing to think a bit more about what we spoke about today so we can talk some more at your next visit?\" Kate appreciates the organized and thoughtful way Dr. M approaches such conversations. She then asks Dr. M if any topics routinely require special attention. He responds, \"Yes, DNR/ code planning is particularly important, and the dialog should follow the same approach of exploring the patient's goals and ORDERS Do Not Resuscitate orders are based upon patients' quality of life preferences. A common and demoralizing error is for clinician or patient to focus discussion on specific treatments, such as resuscitation. (15, 16) A code status order is a specific example of an instructional directive. It anticipates the possibility of cardio-pulmonary arrest and patients' inability to make a considered decision at the moment of arrest. Thomlinson and Brody (17) propose that conversations regarding this aspect of end-of-life care focus on three issues: - The patient's quality of life, before any arrest or resuscitation effort - What the patient hopes her post-resuscitation quality of life will be - What is the probability of successful resuscitation (where \"success\" is achievement of her hoped for post-resuscitation quality of life). Think of the conversation as an attempt to understand the patient's perspective on an acceptable quality of life, and what she is willing to go through to get to that point. Help the patient explore why she wants a certain treatment, framing the dialog in quality of life terms. The outcomes of this conversation will enable clinicians to make recommendations to the patient about whether medical experience (considering the specifics of her illness and predicted results of resuscitation) suggests that resuscitation is likely to result in the acceptable quality of life. Except for the urgency and dramatics of cardio-pulmonary arrest, this decision process is similar to other complex and serious decisions that clinicians and patients face every day. ***module=32 page=5_00.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 5_10.htm Focus on goals, not on treatments Inappropriate focus on the what? rather than the why? of next steps in management is discouraging and painful for patients and physicians. Every student and clinician has had a sad, discouraging and \"heart sink\" experience with the most common error in resuscitation conversations. Physicians focus discussion on treatment options (the what?) in the absence of clarity about goals (the why?) in their attempt to simplify, comply with protocol, or to get the work done quickly. Patients seldom care whether they get vasopressors or anti-arrythmics, and are inevitably confused by their limited understanding of medications, machines, and the probability that successful resuscitation will return them to health (so many television resuscitations emphasize the heroism and imply a return to a full life). (18) Further, in the absence of conversation about goals and quality of life, a clinician's assumptions about what patients imagine as potential outcomes or value about them is likely to be off base at best, and heavily contaminated by the clinician's personal beliefs at worst. The result of conversation limited to options is either that patients make a \"medically irrational\" list of decisions, which clinicians must then try to talk the patient out of, or that securing superficial and forced agreement inflicts unintended and unnecessary pain and suffering on both patient and clinician, and erodes the clinician's ability to serve future patients. ***module=32 page=5_10.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 5_20.htm Invite and promote dialog Invite patients to establish their preferences for resuscitation by dialoging about goals, and use \"What if?\" and \"Let's suppose that \" to guide the discussion. The approach for discussing resuscitation preferences is essentially that of discussing goals of therapy (see above). Once you have set the stage and explored the patient's understanding of his illness, ask if he is willing to have this conversation. Remember, however, you cannot force patients to have an advance directive; and despite the empowerment an advance directive is meant to offer, some argue that forcing patients to even discuss this is unethical. In some studies 25 % of patients don't want to talk about these issues, or make decisions about the future. (16) \"Some people might want to be very involved in making their decisions while others don't. What kind of patient are you? If you prefer not to talk about these issues, with whom should I speak?\" If the patient accepts the offer to dialog, some ways to enter the conversation and uncover the patient's rationale include the following: - \"What if, God forbid, something happens and things do not go as well as we would like? What are your thoughts about some of the decisions we might have to make then?\" - What do you think will happen if we do X? If the patient says that they want the intervention given their current state of health, probe by asking, \"What if something horrible happens and you have a stroke, and you never thought you were going to wake up? Would you still want X?\" Many patients would say, \"No.\" You can then ask about this (\"Tell me why not\" or \"Tell me about that\"), which leads to discussion about quality of life and the patients goals. - Conversely, if the patients say they don't want an intervention you can ask, \"Would you want it even if it was only going to be for a short period of time or if it would get you back to your current state?\" Again, the goal is to try and talk to them about their values. Once you understand their values and goals, you can help them to think about which interventions will help them achieve those goals. (6) Some patients may respond with, \"I want everything\". This phrase may have many meanings. First, it may be an expression of emotion, e.g., \"I am afraid of dying.\" Alternatively, it may reflect a fear of being abandoned as he becomes sicker. Even when the patient is expressing a cognitive desire, the phrase may have different meanings. He may mean that he wants all treatments that you think will help him accomplish his goals. Finally, he may be a vitalist and want all treatments that have any chance of prolonging life, regardless of its quality. Thus, rather than seeing a request for \"everything\" as the end of the conversation, we see it as an initial statement that needs to be explored. (\"Tell me more\".) Most patients' preferences for end of life therapies is hierarchical (from most aggressive and interventional to least). If patients do not want to be readmitted to a hospital, you probably don't need to ask their views regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation. However, take the time to discuss artificial hydration and nutrition, not only because of its highly symbolic meaning, but also because state laws differ regarding the level of proof a surrogate needs to forgo this therapy. (19) These conversations are often stressful for physicians. Talking about goals at the end-of-life may evoke feelings of hopelessness or potential loss of relationship. A physician may also feel sad that a patent she cares for is dying. These emotions are normal.(20) Take a mindful approach and notice your own emotions. Remember prior related events and how and from whom you obtained support and anticipate who will support you now. You might begin with deep breaths or other strategies (Module 2, 4) to help settle feelings and calm your mind. Kate thanks Dr. M and extends appreciation for the learning opportunity. Dr. M inquires what she learned during the day. Kate responds, \"I learned that I'll have to be proactive about end-of-life issues with both office and hospital patients. I have ideas for initiating and nurturing these conversations, and I see that a crucial and difficult task will be to focus on the patient's goals and values, rather than on specific treatments.\" \"Good,\" said Dr. M. \"This was teaching time well-spent, and your patients will benefit from your attentiveness to Page: 6_00.htm CONCLUSION Clinicians who initiate conversations about advance care planning (ACP) enable patients to thoughtfully prepare for their end of life care by addressing the medical, emotional, and social issues that concern every patient, but that many patients are reluctant to bring up themselves. Conversations about ACP that use patient values to guide medical decision making and therapy benefit patients by respecting their values, and benefit clinicians by providing essential guidance when important decisions loom near. Become familiar with the vocabulary of advance care planning and build a personal comfort level with end of life issues so that you have the flexibility to more easily raise and facilitate conversations with patients. Begin the conversation during a time of patient health. Your two major goals are to educate the patient about ACP resources and to learn about their values, goals, and standards for a quality life. Maximize your ability to clarify patients' wishes and to enhance relationships with them through attending to their nonverbal communication, by listening attentively and by checking your understanding through reflecting back what you hear. When patients respond to your reflections, construct follow-up questions to probe for their reasoning, perspectives and assumptions in order to unveil the values that underlie their decisions. ***module=32 page=6_00.htm*** Module: 32 | Page: 7_00.htm RELEVANT BEHAVIORS 1 Preparation - Ensure appropriate setting and check that relevant people can all attend 2 Introduction - Explain why you have convened this meeting now - Explain that its purpose is to respect patient's wishes. - Reassure that death is not believed to be imminent (if true) and avoid false reassurance. - Check how the patient feels about a discussion of advance care planning 3 Information 4 Elicit Preferences - Ask about patient's understanding of the illness and prognosis - Provide additional information, using understandable terms - Clarify shared understanding of illness and prognosis. - Ask for patient's understanding of likely further curative or palliative treatments - Provide additional information regarding likely treatments - Ask if the patient has a living will, and ask what it says. - Explore patients' knowledge of other people's end of life care, and their feelings about it. - Ask patients \"What makes life worth living,\" or \"what should be the goals of treatment at the end of life?\" - Elicit patients' specific preferences, and ask \"why?\" - Identify what life states patients find unacceptable (e.g. Persistent Vegetative State) and what risks they are prepared to take to avoid these states. - Discuss probabilities and ask how patients would manage uncertainty. - If patients say they would not want \"any\" treatment, ask specifically about artificial nutrition and hydration. - Make a recommendation.

Communicating bad news is a core clinical skill, and the quality of your bad news communication has a powerful impact on every other aspect of your clinical relationships. 3. The quality of bad news delivery is strongly affected both by physicians' feelings (especially by negative feelings) and by their competence in responding with empathy to their patients' reactions. 4. The way bad news is delivered will always be much affected by the feelings of providers (often negative) and by their competence (often lacking) in responding to their patients' reactions. 5. Physicians who use the \"6 steps\" for communicating bad news respond more easily to patients' reactions to hearing the news, which fosters trust and respect. ***module=33 page=0_6_Principles.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 0_7_Goals.htm Learning goals: At the conclusion of this module, you will be able to: - Describe the six-step protocol for delivering bad news - Name 4 ways of responding to the feelings of a patient receiving bad news, and give an example of each - Name 4 common barriers or pitfalls in delivering bad news - Demonstrate the ability to deliver bad news using the six-step protocol ***module=33 page=0_7_Goals.htm*** Module: 33 | news\" is not limited to life-threatening situations. Communicating bad news is a challenge for physicians, one that can be carried out effectively and compassionately using a structured six-step approach. Many physicians find this especially challenging when it involves a life-threatening illness. Some physicians feel uncomfortable with the strong emotions that bad news can elicit both in us and our patients. Others feel inadequately prepared or inexperienced, or struggle with their desire to protect the patient and preserve hope, while simultaneously trying to be honest and develop realistic expectations. Despite these challenges, bad news can be conveyed clearly and compassionately. Effectively breaking bad news can improve the patient's and family's ability to plan and cope, encourage realistic goals and autonomy, support the patient emotionally, strengthen the physician-patient relationship, and foster collaboration among the patient, family, physicians, and other professionals. From a patient's perspective diagnoses other than life-threatening illnesses may qualify as \"bad news\". Anything that has the potential to change someone's sense of self or health may be bad news; for example the diagnosis of new hypertension. Physicians know that this is common and usually easily treated, and can easily forget what it means to a patient to hear that he needs to take a medication every day for the rest of his life, or that the implication of the diagnosis may be very different if there is a family history of myocardial infarction or stroke. Remembering that the definition of \"bad news\" is by the listener, not the giver is an important facet of empathic communication. We describe a 6 step process for giving bad news (1,2), and discuss special circumstances in the communication of bad news. These circumstances include discussing prognosis, discussing conflict between what the provider and the family think the patient should know, dealing with uncertainty, and telephone notification of death. ***module=33 page=0_0.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 1_0.htm 6-STEP PROTOCOL FOR COMMUNICATING BAD NEWS Most \"bad news encounters\" can be approached using a similar 6-step process that builds carefully on what patients know and want to know, and allows patients to control the amount and flow of information.(1) 1. [Preparation and Planning.] 2. [What does the patient know?] 3. [How much does the patient want to know?] 4. [Sharing the information]. | Page: 1_10.htm Step 1: Preparation and planning Before meeting with the patient and family, prepare yourself. Consider your own feelings and get them under control enough that you will not be driven by sadness, anger, remorse, or guilt. Imagine how your patient or the family might feel and be ready for an emotional response to what you will tell them. Gather the information you will need. Before starting to communicate any news, plan what will be discussed. Confirm the medical facts of the case. Ensure that all the needed information is available. Rehearse what you will say. Don't delegate the task. When possible, prepare the patient. Let the patient (and family) know what you are thinking about at the time of a diagnostic test, including both benign and potentially worrisome possibilities. This allows the patient and family to prepare psychologically, and may give you some clue as to the meaning they attach to a given diagnosis. Choose an appropriate setting. Create an environment conducive to effective communication. Find a quiet, private place with adequate seating. A box of facial tissues should be handy. Allot adequate time for the discussion. Don't rush. If possible, do not slip this into a short interval between other critical tasks. Try to avoid interruptions by arranging to hold telephone calls and pages. Patients appreciate evidence that you are not rushing or running away. Plan to stay with them as long as is necessary and look as if you plan to stay. Be sure you are seated at eye level with the patient. Identify patient support persons. Determine who else the patient would like to have present for the discussion. This might include family, significant others, surrogate decision makers, or other members of the interdisciplinary team (nurse, social worker, chaplain, etc). Identify support for you. Take care of yourselfto be most effective in some situations, it may help to bring a companion, such as a colleague, a nurse or a social worker. Then, be sure you allow sufficient time so that you can be fully present and do not have to rush, or leave abruptly. ***module=33 page=1_10.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 1_20.htm Step 2: What does the patient know? After the initial greeting and attending to comfort, begin by having the patient and family tell you what they already know. This provides a basic framework for a patient-centered discussion. Start as usual by shaking hands, sitting down, and attending to immediate patient comfort. If there are family members or friends you do not know, introduce yourself and ask about their relationship with the patient. Then begin to establish what the patient and family already know about the patient's health. With this information, ascertain if the patient and family will be able to comprehend the bad news. Questions might include: - What do you understand so far about your illness? - What did other doctors tell you about your condition? - What have you heard so far about what the test showed? - How serious did you think it might be when ? Occasionally a patient will fall silent and seem completely unprepared or unable to respond. To ease the situation and stimulate discussion, try to clarify what the patient understands about his or her medical history and recent investigations. If it appears the patient requires more support, it may be better to reschedule the meeting for another time, and invite other family members. ***module=33 page=1_20.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 1_30.htm Step 3: How much does the patient want to know? Before actually delivering bad news, ask whether the patient is ready for discussion. Asking before telling is respectful and relationship-centered, even though patients may guess that the news is not good based on your tone and facial expression. Establish what and how much each patient wants to know. People handle information differently. Each person has the right to voluntarily decline to receive any information and may designate someone else to communicate on his or her behalf. Ask the patient and family how they would like to receive information before telling them. Possible questions include the following: - How much do you want to know about the results of the test? - How much detail would you like me to give you about your condition? Some people really do not want to be told much at all about their condition, and would rather have family or a friend handle the information. Other people want every detail. Where do you stand on this issue of how much to tell? Ask a patient about general preferences for the handling of medical information and decision making early in the clinical relationship before significant information needs to be shared (this is ideally done in the pretest counseling period). This will help the clinician to avoid making a misstep. \"If your condition turns out to be serious, do you want to know? If not, whom should we tell?\" ***module=33 page=1_30.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 1_40.htm Step 4: Sharing the information Share (tell) information in small amounts at any given time, using clear unambiguous language, giving the patient time to respond to each element you are telling. If information is clearly bad, foreshadow it with a \"warning shot.\" Deliver the information in a sensitive but straightforward manner. Many experts recommend starting with a \"warning shot,\" which helps to prepare the patient for bad news (such as \"I don't have good news \") Give the news using clear, easily understood language, and then stop. Avoid delivering all implications of the information in a single, monologue. Provide information in small chunks, pausing frequently to allow silence and time for patient and family to ask questions about each aspect. Do not use technical jargon or euphemisms (use the word \"cancer\", not \"carcinoma\" or \"tumor\"). Check for understanding. Use silence and body language as tools to facilitate the discussion. Do not minimize the severity of the situation. Well-intentioned efforts to \"soften the blow\" may lead to vagueness and confusion. Patients appreciate honesty and straightforwardness. These qualities do not imply brutality or insensitivity. You might choose to break bad news by using language like: - I feel badly to have to tell you this, but the growth turned out to be cancer. - I'm afraid the news is not good. The biopsy showed that you have colon cancer. - Unfortunately, there's no question about the test results: you have been infected by HIV. - The report is back, and it's not as we had hoped. It showed that it is cancer. - I'm afraid I have bad news. The tests show that you had a heart attack. ***module=33 page=1_40.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 1_50.htm Step 5: Responding to emotions Strong emotions often accompany bad news. Be prepared to respond to them with acknowledgment, legitimation, exploration and empathy. Reinforce your commitment to work through the process with patient and family.(3) It is part of your job to balance emotional support with informational needs. Patients and families respond to bad news in a variety of ways. Responses can be affective (tears, anger, anxiety, fear), cognitive (denial, blame, guilt, disbelief), spiritual (why me?), or even visceral (numbness, disorientation, fight or flight response.) Keep in mind that these responses will be stated to you and directed to you as the \"messenger\" of bad news. However, if you take patients' anger or sadness personally, that will interfere with their ability to process this information and your ability to maintain a relationship. Outbursts of strong emotion make many physicians uncomfortable. Rather than immediately trying to limit emotion, give the patient and family time to react. Be prepared to support them through a broad range of reactions. (M 13) Some basic skills that are useful to respond to emotions (see also M 6) follow: - Acknowledge the emotion. I can see that this is very upsetting. You seem overwhelmed by this news. - Legitimize (validate) the emotion. Anyone in your shoes would be upset. A lot of people would feel angry right now. - Explore the emotions and be sure you understand them before providing reassurance Tell me what is most upsetting to you . Tell me what worries you the most - Empathize I imagine it feels overwhelming. I would probably feel the same way. - Provide support, and partnership We will work through this together. Is there anyone you would like me to call? Avoid saying, \"I understand what you are going through.\" No one can truly understand what another person is going through. Remind patients and families that strong emotional responses are normal. Have a box of facial tissue available. Some patients may express their emotions nonverbally, so be aware of how a patient looks as well as what they say. Some patients may initially \"shut down,\" perhaps feeling overwhelmed by emotion or by internal reflection about the personal meaning of the news. Quietly listening and \"being with\" a patient in distress can be helpful nonverbal expression of caring. Consider touching the patient in an appropriate, reassuring manner.(m13,14,41) Allow time for the patient and family to express all of their immediate feelings. Don't rush them. Once the emotion is \"spent,\" most people will be able to move on. A shared understanding of the news and its meaning will enhance the physician-patient relationship and facilitate future decision-making and planning. Sometimes physicians continue to talk while a patient is shut down or nonverbally expressing emotion, perhaps out of their own anxiety or a desire to cover important information. Don't be afraid of silence. If you find yourself talking too much in such an encounter (if it becomes a monologue rather than a dialogue), consider stopping and trying to respond to the associated emotions (\"You seem overwhelmed \") or count silently to 20 in your head. Stopping or slowing yourself helps patients experience your presence and support at a time when they cannot absorb your information. If the early discussion is all emotion, suggest that the patient may have many questions that you will address at a subsequent visit. If the patient's initial response is all intellectual, suggest that they may have strong emotions when they go home, and to call with any concerns. ***module=33 page=1_50.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 1_60.htm Step 6: Planning and follow-up Make concrete plans with the patient about immediate next steps that may include both medical as well as personal aspects. Address any medical or personal safety issues. Reinforce your commitment and your availability for questions and follow-up. Establish a plan for the next steps. This may include gathering additional information or performing further tests or telling other family members. Arrange for appropriate referrals. Discuss potential sources of emotional and practical support (e.g., family, significant others, friends, social worker, spiritual counselor, peer support group, professional therapist, hospice, home health agency). Reassure the patient and family that they are not being abandoned and that you will be actively engaged in an ongoing plan to help. Indicate how the patient and family can reach you to answer additional questions. Establish a specific time for a follow-up appointment or phone call. Assess the patients' safety. Ensure that patients' will be safe after they depart. Are there medical concerns that need immediate attention? Is the patient able to drive home alone? Is the patient distraught, feeling desperate or suicidal? Is there someone at home to provide support? Patients and families may or may not be able to make decisions during an initial conversation, when information sharing is the primary goal. You will probably have an opinion about what decisions could or should be made, but far more important is your provision of support for their decisions (or non-decisions), and your efforts to maintain a relationship. This ensures both that the patient and family feel respected, and increases the likelihood that you will be able to provide guidance for their future decisions. ***module=33 page=1_60.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 2_0.htm SOME SPECIFIC SITUATIONS In this section we cover the following topics - [Physician self-reflection] In order to participate effectively in conversations about bad news, physicians should review and explore their personal concerns and feelings that are typical in these situations. Some concerns and emotions may be obscure, confusing or discounted. - [When the family says \"don't tell\"] Most patients eventually want to know their diagnosis, but listen carefully to a family's request to withhold information. Assess whether the request makes sense within the family system, culture, or patient values, and respond accordingly. - [When language is a barrier] Use an experienced medical translator when delivering bad news to someone who speaks another language. In general, the same 6 step protocol can be followed, but when using a translator, be certain you double- check understanding at each stage. - [Tips about communicating prognosis] When discussing prognosis give a range of time that the \"average person\" with this condition would live (hours to days, days to weeks, 3-6 months, etc), and allow for exceptions. Physicians tend to be optimistic, so be sure to prepare patients and families that the time could be shorter than anticipated. - [Telephone notification of death] Telephone notification about a death is a challenging communication problem, especially if you are a covering physician without prior interactions with the family. Prepare for the call, identify who should be contacted, and follow the 6-step protocol.(6) - [The challenges sorry\" is an empathic expression of sorrow, but it can be confused with pity or with an apology, and may shift focus from the patient and family to the physician. - [The significance of physicians' saying \"I wish...\"] Wishes stated by clinicians are first and foremost expressions of empathy. The clinician joins the patient and family in wishing that things were different, and simultaneously acknowledges the emotional impact of the loss. ***module=33 page=2_0.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 2_05.htm Physician self-reflection In order to participate effectively in conversations about bad news, physicians should review and explore their personal concerns and feelings that are typical in these situations. Some concerns and emotions may be obscure, confusing or discounted. Physicians often experience difficult and sometimes confusing feelings when telling patients bad news. Negative, confusing and conflicting feelings are normal physician responses to these situations. Their scope and intensity varies with the patient, the disease, past experience with illness, and family attitudes. Physician emotions include a sense of loss of control, a fear of death, feelings of guilt or loneliness, and at times more complex and less discernible feelings. In order to be fully present and to conduct an honest and open discussion with patients and families, physicians must acknowledge the legitimacy of their own feelings and come up with a strategy for coping with them. Find time to explore your reactions to bad news discussions. What did the discussion bring up about your own life and your own family? It will sometimes be possible to take time right after the meeting with the patient to do this, other times you will have to wait until the workday is finished. Some people find it helpful to discuss their feelings with a trusted colleague, some people journal or meditate. Provided any identifying details of the case are taken out, it is permissible and potentially important to discuss your feelings and reactions with a close family member or friend. ***module=33 page=2_05.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 2_10.htm When the family says \"don't tell\" Most patients eventually want to know their diagnosis, but listen carefully to a family's request to withhold information. Assess whether the request makes sense within the family system, culture, or patient values, and respond accordingly. Many times, family members will ask the physician not to tell the patient the diagnosis or other important information. While it is the physician's legal obligation to obtain informed consent from the patient, an effective therapeutic relationship generally requires a meaningful alliance with the family. Ask them why they don't want you to tell the patient, what it is they are afraid you will say, or what their experience has been with bad news, rather than confronting their request with \"I have to tell the patient.\" Inquire whether there is a personal, cultural, or religious context to their concern. Suggest that you go to the patient together to ask how much the patient wants to know about the situation and what questions there might be.(4) After discussion with the patient, it may be ultimately decided that details of diagnosis, prognosis or treatment will be discussed only with the family. However, unless the patient has previously indicated that he wants no information, hiding the diagnosis or important information about prognosis or treatment (especially if the patient is asking to be fully informed!) is neither ethically nor legally acceptable. These situations may require significant negotiation. In particularly difficult cases support from the institutional ethics committee may be helpful. ***module=33 page=2_10.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 2_20.htm When language is a barrier Use an experienced medical translator when delivering bad news to someone who speaks another language. In general, the same 6 step protocol can be followed, but when using a translator, be certain you double- check understanding at each stage. This same 6-step protocol for communicating bad news can be used when the patient and physician do not speak the same language. The assistance of an experienced translator who understands medical terminology and is comfortable translating bad news is required. Avoid using family members or untrained bilingual people as translators. Use knowledge of the patient and family to guide this decision. It could confuse their roles in the family unit and may raise issues of confidentiality. It may also lead to miscommunications due to the translator's agenda. Before the interview, brief translators about the nature of the discussion. If they are inexperienced medical translators, reassure them their role is only to translate. Verify that they will be comfortable translating the news you are about to give. When working with a translator, sit in a triangular arrangement so that you can face and speak directly to the patient, yet still turn to look at the translator. Speak in short segments, and then give the translator time to convey the information. Verify the patient's and family's understanding and check for an emotional response. ***module=33 page=2_20.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 2_30.htm Communicating about prognosis When discussing prognosis give a range of time that the \"average person\" with this condition would live (hours to days, days to weeks, 3-6 months, etc), and allow for exceptions. Physicians tend to be optimistic, so be sure to prepare patients and families that the time could be shorter than anticipated. Patients and family members frequently ask about prognosis. This request stems from varied motivations. Some people want to have a sense of their future so they can plan their lives. Others are terrified and hope that you will reassure them that things are not so serious. Before directly answering questions about prognosis, ask about the reasons for asking. Questions might include: - How specific do you want me to be? - What experiences have you had with others with a similar illness? - What have you been told about the future? Consider the implications of the prognostic information you provide. Patients who wish to plan their lives want information that is more detailed. Those who are terrified may do better with answers that are more general. Overly definitive answers, such as, \"You have 6 months to live,\" risk producing disappointment if the time proves to be less, and anger or frustration if you have underestimated the patient's lifespan. Consider giving a range of time that encompasses an average life expectancy: - \"On average patients with your condition live\" \" to \"days to weeks,\" \"weeks to \"months to years,\" etc. - Then follow with, \"Of course, there can be exceptions in either direction you might live longer than expected and we will do everything in our power to make that happen; but you also might live a shorter time, so you should probably attend to critical matters right now just in case.\" - Emphasize the limits of prediction, \"What this will mean for you I can't tell. We'll have a better sense over time how things will evolve for you.\" Physicians tend to be optimistic in an attempt to preserve hope. The danger in attempting to preserve hope is that of fostering false hope and developing unrealistic expectations. Always caution patients and families that unexpected surprises can happen. Suggest that they get their affairs in order so they won't be as vulnerable if something unexpected does occur sooner rather than later. Reassure them that you will be available to help with issues and support them throughout their illness, whatever happens. Help clarify what can be realistically expected and distinguish this from what might be wished for, or what is most feared. Identify the miraculous for what it issomething outside of usual experience that happens exceedingly rarely. It may be helpful to say something like \"we need to hope for the best, while we plan for the worst. We can't predict surprises and should plan in case something happens.\"(5) ***module=33 page=2_30.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 2_40.htm Telephoning a notification of death Telephone notification about a death is a challenging communication problem, especially if you are a covering physician without prior interactions with the family. Prepare for the call, identify who should be contacted, and follow the 6-step protocol.(6) Prepare for the Call - Positively identify the patient (hospital ID bracelet) and confirm death. - Obtain relevant information; e.g. patient's name, age, gender, SS# and other ID numbers. - Obtain the full name, address, phone number(s) of the person/s you are calling. Try to establish from the chart and nursing staff the relationship of the contact to the deceased patient. - Establish the circumstances of death; expected or sudden. Write down the key information you need and thoroughly review what you will say. - Always promptly inform families of a grave turn of events. When patients die, call families right away. - Find a quiet or private area to place your call. Telephone Notification Procedures - Identify yourself; ask the identity of the person you are talking to and their relationship to the patient. Ask to speak to the person closest to the patient (ideally, the health care proxy or the contact person indicated in the chart). Avoid responding to any direct question until you have verified the identity of the person to whom you are speaking. Ask if the contact person is alone. Do not give death notification to minor children. - Ask what the person knows about the patient's condition: \"What have the doctors told you about ____'s condition?\" - Provide a warning shot: \"I'm afraid I have some very bad news.\" - Use clear and direct language, without medical jargon; \"I'm sorry, ____ has just died.\" -Use or \"didn't make it\" which can be misinterpreted. -Never deliver the news of death to an answering machine or voice mail. Instead, leave specific contact information. If you are unable to make contact within 1-2 hours, contact a hospital representative (e.g. Social Worker). -Speak clearly and slowly, allow time for questions; be empathic. - If the family chooses to come to see the body, arrange to meet them personally. - Provide contact information for the physician or hospital official who can meet with them and answer questions about the patient's death and other administrative issues. - Ask if you can contact anyone for them. Assess their emotional reaction. Briefly assess their safety (suicidality, ability to drive). - If you feel uncomfortable about telephone notification, ask for help. When might you not disclose a death in a telephone call? In rare circumstances, it may seem more appropriate to ask family members to first come to the hospital, rather than telling them about the death over the telephone. Most agree that it is preferable to present death notification in person. However, clinicians must weigh the benefits of truthfulness against the risk of potential harm resulting from abrupt disclosure of bad news. Some factors to consider in making this decision include the following: - the anticipated emotional reaction of the contact person based on prior information. - whether the contact person will be alone when receiving the information. - the contact person's level of understanding. - distance, availability of transport, and time of day. The notifier must be prepared to quickly integrate all these factors to decide whether to reveal that the patient is dead, or to describe the patient as gravely ill and request that the contact person come to the hospital immediately. If you decide to delay disclosure of the death, be prepared to make immediate admission of such nondisclosure as soon as you meet the family (e.g. \"I'm sorry for not telling you the whole thing right away over the telephone,\" then give your reasons for not telling.) ***module=33 page=2_40.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 2_50.htm The challenge of stating, \"I'm Sorry\" \"I am so sorry that this happened to you.\" \"I'm sorry\" is an empathic expression of sorrow, but it can be confused with pity or with an apology, and may shift focus from the patient and family to the physician.(7) \"I'm sorry \" is generally intended as an empathic expression of sorrow, acknowledging and sharing the sadness and unfairness of the patient's being sick. By expressing sorrow, the clinician shows himself to be a human being with feelings of connection to the patient that the patient's loss has touched him or her as a person. However, saying \"I'm sorry \" can be problematic for the following reasons: - Confusion with sympathy, or even pity. (I feel sorry for you). - Shortcutting a deeper understanding. (Premature statements of sorrow may limit the family 's expression of loss. Perhaps it would be better to say, \"Tell me the most difficult part,\" before responding with sorrow so that it is fully understood.) - Confusion with apologies. (I am sorry that I contributed to your suffering; or I hope that you can forgive me for my role in what happened.) - Changing the subject from patient and family to the physician. - Physician: I'm sorry. - Family: It's okay, doctor; you did the best you could. - Physician: (a response that turns back to the emotions might be the following:) I know it is not my fault, but I still feel badly. Genuine expressions of sorrow can still be humanizing and helpful provided the physician is aware that they can be misinterpreted. By paying careful attention to the family's verbal and nonverbal responses to \"I'm sorry\", you can identify and correct such misunderstandings. ***module=33 page=2_50.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 2_60.htm The significance of saying, \"I Wish \" I wish we had more effective treatment for your condition. I wish I had some other kind of news to give you. I wish things had turned out better for you. Wishes stated by clinicians are first and foremost expressions of empathy. The clinician joins the patient and family in wishing that things were different, and simultaneously acknowledges the emotional impact of the loss.(7) Patients frequently make statements about hope during a discussion regarding bad news. Sometimes they say they hope they will get well or live a normal life span, and at other times may describe feeling a complete lack of hope. Your responses should be honest and also not deny hope. Honesty should prevent physicians from giving false hope, yet denying all hope is just as damaging. The parallel requirements for honesty and hope present a communication dilemma. There are two types of goals: hope-specific and hope-general. An adequate discussion of hope reflects the fact that goals necessarily change as situations alter. For example, instead of hoping for a long life, focus the patient on hoping for quality of life, freedom from suffering, or living until a certain milestone (if this is plausible.) A more general type of hope is a sense that things will get better and that the patient will find peace. Ask patients what they are hoping for and help them to reframe their hopes into something they are likely to receive. (see M 34) Speaking of \"wishes\" allows patients and clinicians to temporarily suspend reality, and join together to express a fleeting hope that the patient's circumstances could be different. By characterizing statements as wishes, the physician underscores that what is being hoped for is not likely to occur. This expression, \"I wish we had more effective treatment for your condition,\" is different from saying something hopeful that may not be connected to reality, such as, \"I hope we can find effective treatment for your condition.\" Whether such statements represent true hope or false hope depend on the genuineness of the statement, and on the reality of whether effective treatments are available. You should not say, \"We are hoping to find more treatment for your condition,\" unless there is a reasonable chance of finding such treatment. Instead, express your hope as a wish that simultaneously acknowledges the reality that it is unrealistic, such as, \"I wish that we had more effective treatments that we could offer you.\" Statements in the form of wishes acknowledge your limited ability to control medical matters and your regret that medicine is not more powerful and effective. Wish statements are more helpful when they begin a conversation. Then, patients might be invited to share their sadness and loss more fully by being asked \"What has been the hardest part?\" or \"As you look to the future, what is your biggest worry?\" Once wishes and disappointments are fully explored, the patient, family and clinician must begin a search together for hope and direction that is consistent with the patient's clinical condition and values. Medicine's ability to cure or control disease is but one avenue of hope. The search for hope in other dimensions may include living with the disease rather than curing it, exploring experimental therapy (which at least has not been shown not to work), being free of pain or other symptoms or achieving closure. ***module=33 page=2_60.htm*** Module: 5_0.htm BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST Verbal behaviors - Ask what the patient and family already know and what they expect. - Ask before telling. - Use a \"warning shot,\" such as, \"I do not have good news.\" - Use simple, straight-forward language. - Give the patient and family time to respond to each piece of information. - Acknowledge, legitimize and explore strong emotion before reassuring or moving on. - Describe a range of time when communicating prognosis; allow for exceptions. - Because patient and families don't hear much after the initial diagnosis, repeat key data during both the initial conversation and follow ups. - Establish a concrete plan for immediate next steps. - Assure the patient and family that you will make certain they are not abandoned. Non-verbal behaviors - Find a private space and uninterrupted time. - Sit down, shake hands, and check in with patient and family. - Listen carefully to the verbal responses, and observe carefully the nonverbal responses. - Allow silence. - Have tissues handy. ***module=33 page=5_0.htm*** Module: 33 | Page: 6_0.htm POTENTIAL PITFALLS - Delivering news in a public place. Privacy matters. - Failing to turn off your pager. Interruptions hurt and distract. - Using imprecise language to soften the blow. Lack of clarity compromises comprehension. - Offering premature reassurance. Premature reassurance severely damages credibility and relationship. - Giving too much information too early. Information overload wastes time and risks ignoring emotions. - Failing to attend and respond to expressions of emotion. Lack of response leaves people feeling ignored and disrespected. - Talking too much. Silence assists reflection, diminishes confusion and facilitates more effective communication. - Being overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. Patients and families value balancing truthfulness with compassion; they are angered or dismayed by distortions of the grim facts. - Communicating news over the telephone. Telephones minimize human connections and supportiveness. CONCLUSION \"I just couldn't believe he was talking about me!\" (Quote from a young patient reflecting back on receiving the diagnosis of gastric cancer.) Learning to deliver bad news with honesty, compassion and attention to individual needs and preferences is a core clinical skill that will only improve if you practice and attend carefully to the impact of your bad news conversations with patients and families. Physicians frequently experience both the privilege and the challenge of delivering bad news. Sometimes the news is bad no matter who is receiving it (gastric cancer), and other times it is experienced as bad because of personal experience (hypertension in a patient whose parent had a disabling stroke.) Following the six-step process allows the physician to prepare, allows the patient to control the flow of information, suggests ways of responding to the emotions that inevitably accompany such encounters and suggests strategies for joining with the patient to create an individualized initial plan of care.

Physicians may overcome their own sense of hopelessness and helplessness and relieve considerable suffering through directed interventions and compassionate communication. Physicians often feel they have little to offer patients near the end of life. Perhaps the patient with metastatic cancer has failed his third round of chemotherapy or the patient with left main coronary artery disease is ineligible for bypass surgery because of his compromised medical status. Perhaps the patient with dementia responded to treatment of her aspiration pneumonia but then aspirated again a week later. The doctor may feel helpless in the face of the approaching end of life, but in fact she has a great deal to offer. Many patients feel even more helpless hopeless, isolated, frightened, and in pain. They and their families turn to their physician for help in the physical, psychological, and spiritual domains. End-of-life care is a critically important, labor-intensive form of medical care. Physicians must be able to communicate their ability to relieve suffering, and assure patients that they will not be abandoned. ***module=34 page=0_0.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 1_0.htm WHAT PATIENTS WANT NEAR THE END OF LIFE Patients' key needs include controlling symptoms, preparing for death, achieving a sense of completion, avoiding suffering, finding ways not to be a burden to their family, and remaining in control. Both patients and their families suffer from limited or absent physician communication, and especially a paucity of emotional support. When patients are asked what matters to them near the end of life, they identify control of symptoms (primarily pain but also nausea, shortness of breath, constipation, etc.), preparation for death (spiritual peace), and achieving a sense of completion (saying goodbye and making amends) (1). When patients list the ingredients of high quality medical care near the end of life, they again say control of pain and other symptoms. They also mention avoiding suffering by excessive prolongation of life; they say they do not want to be a burden on their loved ones; and they talk about maintaining a modicum of control over their lives. (2) When families are asked to look back on the dying experience of their relatives, a few other major themes emerge. They typically comment that one of the principal deficiencies in care, whether in the hospital, the nursing home, or the home, was the paucity of emotional support. Home hospice does better than care in other settings, but still has a good deal of room for improvement. One fourth of families report specifically that they had concerns with physician communication (3). And when the family members of nearly 500 recently deceased patients were asked open-ended questions about the care of their loved ones, 44% spontaneously indicated that better communication with the physician was needed (4). Both patients and their families seem to agree that discussions with the physician are particularly crucialand singularly lackingduring the close of life. ***module=34 page=1_0.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 2_00.htm COMMUNICATING BAD NEWS Prepare yourself to sensitively communicate with your patients and family members about both abrupt and insidious declines in health status.(6) Patients may enter the final stage of life abruptly, with an acute overwhelming illness such as a massive stroke or a highly malignant brain tumor, or they may move insidiously into a state of increasing frailty. At some point, the physician needs to inform the patient that his underlying health status has changed, with important implications for subsequent medical and personal decisions. Informing the patient of the new developments is a step that must be taken sensitively and carefully and ideally includes informing his family or significant others. ***module=34 page=2_00.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 2_10.htm When the family says \"don't tell\" Most patients eventually want to know their diagnosis, but listen carefully to a family's request to withhold information. Assess whether the request makes sense within the family system, culture, or patient values, and respond accordingly. Many times, family members will ask the physician not to tell the patient the diagnosis or other important information. While it is the physician's legal obligation to obtain informed consent from the patient, an effective therapeutic relationship generally requires a meaningful alliance with the family. Ask them why they don't want you to tell the patient, what it is they are afraid you will say, or what their experience has been with bad news, rather than confronting their request with \"I have to tell the patient.\" Inquire whether there is a personal, cultural, or religious context to their concern. Suggest that you go to the patient together to ask how much he or she wants to know about his or her health and what questions there might be.(4) After discussion with the patient, it may ultimately be decided that details of diagnosis, prognosis and/or treatment will be discussed only with the family. However, unless the patient has previously indicated that he or she wants no information, hiding the diagnosis or important information about prognosis or treatment , especially if the patient is asking to be fully informed, is neither ethical nor legally acceptable. These situations may require significant negotiation. In particularly difficult cases, support from the institutional ethics committee may be helpful. ***module=34 page=2_10.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 3_0.htm PLANNING AND PREPARATION Consider in advance what you know about the patient and the family as people and how they are likely to react and what responses on your part might be helpful. Be sure to have the biopsy report in hand or the telephone number of a specialist to whom you plan to refer the patient. Allow enough time for the meeting. ***module=34 page=3_0.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 4_0.htm GENERAL INTER-PERSONAL SKILLS All the fundamental skills of relationship, data gathering and education (see 'Essential Elements' modules) are crucial in end of life interviews. If the patient and family do not have any questions or say little in response to the news, the physician may probe gently, asking what worries them most about what they've just been told. Sometimes humor is helpful particularly if the physician and patient have a well-established relationship. Finally, at the end of the meeting, it is useful to summarize whatever decisions and plans have been made. ***module=34 page=4_0.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 5_00.htm TALKING ABOUT PROGNOSIS Most patients want to know their prognosis, uncertainty is often high, and many physicians lack skills for telling about prognosis compassionately. A related theme is discussing prognosis. Breaking the news, providing a diagnosis, naming the problem, and planning next steps are all important, but patients cannot make informed medical decisionsor other decisions about their livesunless they understand their prognosis. In general, patients want to know their prognosis and physicians are reluctant to make predictions. As a result, one study of patients enrolled in a hospice program found that the attending physician vastly overestimated the prognosis in talking to patients: 63% were over-optimistic about life expectancy, 20% were reasonably accurate, and 17% under-estimated life expectancy. Interestingly, the closer the patient/doctor relationship, the less accurate was the stated prognosis (7). We know from the SUPPORT study (Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatment) that physicians are reasonably accurate in their ability to privately predict outcomes (though they certainly can be wrong for any given patient), but they are reluctant to actually divulge their views to patients (8). But patients need to have an approximate idea of their likely course to make rational decisions about treatment. The consequences of failing to have a good grasp of reality are striking: in one study of over 900 patients hospitalized with advanced cancer, all of whom had a 50% chance of dying in the next six months, those who believed they were going to live longer than six months were far more likely to request life-prolonging treatment over comfort care. The tendency to want aggressive measures was especially prominent in those patients who believed they had a greater than 90% chance of living longer than six months but whose physicians estimated the odds at only 10% (9). Families often express concern that discussions with patients about their prognosis will precipitate despair. However, a multi-site prospective study of patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers found no association between discussions about their future and the rate of major depression. Such conversations were associated with less use of invasive interventions such as ventilators and resuscitation at the end of life (10). ***module=34 page=5_00.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 5_10.htm Rehearsing what you might say.. Rehearsing what you typically might say, and using the Palliative Performance Scale can help you overcome your reluctance to predict survival and discuss death. Estimating survival is more difficult with diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end stage congestive heart failure, or dementia, than with malignancies. The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization developed guidelines for assessing hospice eligibility for non-cancer diagnoses that can help with prognostication (see referral to hospice, below). Another valuable tool is the Palliative Performance Scale, a simple scale from 0 (dead) to 100 (fully intact), that incorporates functional status, disease burden, and cognition into a single measure (11). One barrier to physicians' disclosing prognostic information is their discomfort with talking about imminent death, quite apart from the uncertainty associated with the predictions. A widely used approach is to say that \"everyone is different, but many patients with your condition only have a little time left.\" Another formulation focuses on the average life expectancy: the physician might say \"On average patients with your condition live\" \" hours to days,\" \"days to weeks,\" \"weeks to Share the uncertainty of predictions: \"What this will mean for you I can't tell. We'll have a better sense over time how things will evolve for you.\" ***module=34 page=5_10.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 6_00.htm ELICITING GOALS OF CARE Discuss with your patient what is important to him at this stage. Once physicians have communicated the diagnosis and prognosis, patients are in a position to think about their own goals of care. Physicians can introduce this subject by asking \"what is most important to you at this stage?\" Patients will typically talk about the desire to be at home and to spend time with family; perhaps they will indicate that they do not want to be a burden to others or that they do not themselves want to suffer. This is an opportunity to deepen the conversation, and ascertain whether there are unresolved conflicts between family members that should be addressed in the time remaining, or spiritual issues that require attention, perhaps from the clergy. ***module=34 page=6_00.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 6_10.htm Update goals; clarify your patient's more like \"life-prolongation,\" \"maintaining function,\" or \"maximizing comfort.\" Prioritize goals and revisit whenever his underlying status changes. Depending on patients' response to the open-ended question about what is most important, physicians may inquire which of the three major goals of medical care matters most: life-prolongation, maintenance of function, or maximization of comfort. Acknowledge that most patients have all three goals, but that trade-offs are frequently necessary. Prioritizing patients' goals of care is useful to physicians as they try to determine what medical interventions would be appropriate for a given patient (14). At the time of diagnosis of a life-threatening illness, patients often continue to view life-prolongation as their major goal. As long as cure remains possible or the disease can be well-controlled, maximal medical therapy including treatment in an intensive care unit, intubation, dialysis, etc. may be reasonable. Even attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation may be appropriate in the event of a cardiac arrest, though survival is rare in patients with terminal illness (15). As the patient's illness progresses, he will often come to view maintenance of function as his primary goalremaining as independent as possible and continuing to be able to see, hear, walk, and think. When function becomes the primary goal, physicians should clarify that vigorous treatment of medical problems will continue, but that attempted CPR, intubation, and ICU care are seldom consistent with this goal. Finally, when comfort becomes the major goal, physicians should translate this into medical care that is consistent with this priority (antibiotics, oxygen, pain medication, etc) and care that is not (surgery, hospitalization, as well as CPR). ***module=34 page=6_10.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 6_20.htm Mediate goals with families Prepare to mediate disagreements between patients and family members. Sometimes patients and their family members disagree about the goals of care: not uncommonly, the patient favors an approach focused on comfort, but a spouse or adult child wants life-prolonging therapy. You may need to mediate the conflict, emphasizing that you are an advocate for the patient and are seeking to respect his wishes. Back and Arnold (16) suggest specific physician strategies and phrases for mediating typical conflicts. Referral to a palliative care service can also help (17). The physician member of the palliative care team might facilitate a family meeting to discuss the issues, and the social work member of the team may be a good source of psychosocial support for the entire family. 7_00.htm MAKING A HOSPICE REFERRAL When you ascertain that your patient desires comfort care, be prepared to discuss what hospice offers. When the physician has discussed and then reviewed the goals of care, and it is clear that the patient's overriding goal is now comfort, it is time to think about a referral to hospice. Hospice programs typically provide comprehensive care for patients with a prognosis of six months or less who agree to forgo \"curative\" treatments, and this care is primarily home-based. Some insurance company benefits offer hospice to patients with a life-threatening illness without restricting access based on a six-month prognosis (18). To raise the possibility of hospice, physicians need to know what benefits it offers. For many families, the major benefits include the involvement of a hospice nurse who makes home visits, the availability of an on-call nurse 24/7, emotional support from the hospice team (including a social worker and chaplain), volunteers, and bereavement services. The physician should also be sensitive that \"hospice\" connotes imminent death to many people or suggests that the primary doctor is \"giving up\" on the patient (15). Remind the family and the patient that the primary care physician can remain the attending physician when a patient enrolls in hospice, and that hospice programs are most effective when patients are enrolled earlier rather than later, for weeks or months rather than days, when this is feasible. Patients and families also need education about opioids, particularly that they are commonly prescribed for serious illness, they do not shorten life and their use does not imply that death is imminent. ***module=34 page=7_00.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 7_10.htm Arrange hospice care Advise that the best way to achieve comfort care at home is usually through hospice. Review hospice services with patient and family, and arrange for an intake interview. Broaching the subject of hospice, like breaking bad news, should begin by asking the patient what he understands about his condition. The physician should move on to ask about the future, saying, for example: \"What goals do you have for the time you have left? What is important to you?\" If the patient understands his situation, wishes his medical care to focus on his comfort, and expresses interest in remaining at home, the physician might respond \"you've told me you want to be as independent and comfortable as possible. Hospice care is the best way I know to help you achieve those goals.\" (15) Finally, the physician should clarify that when he makes a referral to hospice, a nurse from the program will come to the home and provide further information about their services. Only then would the patient need to decide about substituting hospice care for her existing health insurance. ***module=34 page=7_10.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 8_0.htm SAYING GOODBYE Recognize and respond to your own feelings of loss or sadness as your patient nears death. Care for him and for yourself by acknowledging your personal relationship and the meaning it has for you. Reinforce this healing process with a hug (if culturally acceptable), send a condolence card, offer assistance to family, and make a follow-up call. Physicians often feel sad after a patient dies, especially when it's someone for whom they provided care over an extended period of time. Just as patients who are dying are encouraged to say goodbye to friends and family, forgiving them for any wrongdoing and making amends themselves, physicians may wish to say goodbye to a dying patient. This is an opportunity to state explicitly that the relationship has been personally meaningful. One formulation is: \"It's been a privilege to help take care of you; I'm going to miss you when you're gone.\" Another approach is to say: \"I don't know if I will see you again. I will always remember the colorful caps you crocheted that you wore when you came to see me after your chemotherapy and your wry sense of humor.\" A hug often communicates more than words. When a patient dies, the relationship between the physician and the patient's family often comes to an end as well. Since the physician may have had a relationship with both the patient and her significant other, this is a second loss. The loss can be mitigated slightly by the physician sending a condolence card or telephoning the family member. Offering to helpsometimes family members wish to see the autopsy report, in some instances they have questions about the actual cause of death, sometimes they themselves need help in coping with the deathwill be warmly appreciated. bad news, discussing prognosis, eliciting the patient's goals, translating goals into interventions, providing psychosocial support, and saying goodbye are critically important skills for all physicians who participate in end-of-life care. Often it is specialistsoncologists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, and otherswho provide much of the care for patients with advanced illness. Primary care physicians, particularly if they have a longstanding relationship with the patient, need to work together with specialists to shepherd patients through what is often an intense and emotionally trying phase of life. While the ultimate outcome of a fatal illness is predictably death, other outcomes such as symptom relief and patient and family satisfaction can be markedly improved through excellent communication between physicians, patient, and family. ***module=34 page=9_10.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 9_20.htm BEHAVIOR SKILLS LIST - Regularly ask your patient what she knows about her condition - Invite your patient to talk about what is most important to her - Respond to patient's distress non-verbally (e.g., touch and tissues) as well as verbally - Legitimate feelings including 'bad' feelings - Seek confirmation of patient's priorities - Offer to engage with family and significant others - Acknowledge the concerns of family members and help them see the patient's perspective - Offer an approximate estimate of how much time your patient has left - As curative treatments fail, offer a palliative care consultation - Ask what your patient knows about palliative care - Ask what your patient would want from palliative care - Explain as needed what palliative care can offer - Initiate conversation about hospice, and advise that hospice care is usually the best way to achieve the goals of comfort care - Initiate conversation about proxy and advance directives - Facilitate family communication - Clarify next steps - Communicate your personal sense of loss and sadness when saying goodbye ***module=34 page=9_20.htm*** Module: 34 | Page: 9_30.htm BIBLIOGRAPHY - Steinhauser K, Christakis N, Clipp E, et al.

Module: 35 | Page: 0_5_Questions.htm Questions for Reflection: - Imagine that you are a patient, and that a mistake or unforeseen complication occurred during your surgery that will probably require an amputation. What information would you like about the situation, and how would you like to be told? - what could your physician say and do to help you handle your intense feelings of loss, anger, and blame? - If you or a family member or a lawyer wanted to sue whoever made the mistake, what could the physician or system do to mitigate the intensity of the urge to file suit? - Can you imagine communication strategies or skills which, if your physician had utilized them in advance of the operation, might ease your conversations after the operation? - Remember or imagine a mistake you made that caused a patient permanent harm, and your discussions with the patient and family, and with colleagues. What were / would be the most painful moments, and what could people say or do to minimize your guilt, shame, anger, and defensiveness? ***module=35 page=0_5_Questions.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 0_6_Principles.htm Key Principles: - Contemporary standards of professionalism mandate that physicians disclose errors and discuss unexpected outcomes. - Unexpected outcomes can be trivial or tragic, and might or might not involve errors. - Talks with patients about unexpected outcomes (with or without error) are more likely to be collaborative if the physician has previously conducted an informed consent discussion with adequate time for exploration of risks, benefits, and patient concerns. - Intense feelings of anger, sadness, blame, shame, distrust and defensiveness are normal when serious unexpected outcomes occur. - In the face of tragic outcomes, skilled communication can enable you to maintain a strong relationship with patients and their families and reduce your malpractice risk. You can accomplish this by open and honest disclosure without hedging, blaming or defensiveness and explicit acknowledgment and acceptance of feelings. - When serious unexpected outcomes occur physicians need personal support from colleagues and administration. ***module=35 page=0_6_Principles.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 0_7_Goals.htm Learning goals: At the conclusion of this module, you will be able to: - List reasons why an informed consent dialog helps to prevent undesired outcomes - Describe ethical and professional principles that support honest disclosure of errors. - Describe elements of a disclosure discussion: setting the stage; succinctly reviewing background facts; responding to feelings; including everyone; avoiding hedging and conjecture; apologizing; arranging follow up - Demonstrate a respectful response to the feelings of patients, families and clinicians when communicating about medical error. ***module=35 page=0_7_Goals.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 1_00.htm ERROR IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM Medical errors are common and cause many deaths. Unexpected and disappointing outcomes without error are also common, due to biologic variability and incorrect judgments in complex situations. Every physician makes errors. According to the Institute of Medicine report (1) medical errors are the 8th leading cause of death in the United States, with medication errors alone accounting for over 7,000 deaths annually. \"Error\" oftens seems difficult to define because illness and medical care are so complex and uncertainty is so prevalent. A medical / legal definition is: \"Act of commission or omission with potential negative consequences for the patient that would be judged wrong by skilled and knowledgeable peers at the time it occurred, independent of whether there were actually any negative consequences.\" Notice the important role played by medical peers, and that the actual outcome is not relevant. Many unexpected outcomes result from the biological variability of patient and illness: either the illness appears to be particularly virulent, or the patient resistant to usual treatment. Uncommon, or \"low probability\" side effects and complications account for many disappointments (2). Sometimes physicians make judgments which prove incorrect, but without negligence; that is, the physician recommends the wrong path when confronted with a difficult decision involving significant uncertainties. Finally, frank errors occur, and every physician occasionally makes them. Many other errors are complex and result from the interaction of multiple factors and systems issues (1). ***module=35 page=1_00.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 1_10.htm Patients and physicians often have differing expectations for success Patients and families have high expectations for success and \"expectation mismatch\" is a major source of complaints and distress. In some cases patients and families have much higher expectations from treatment than their physicians do. If these high expectations go uncorrected, an unwanted result might be called \"expectation mismatch.\" Physicians, aware of the complexities of care, may be only slightly surprised by an unanticipated outcome. But the element of surprise may raise doubts and suggest the possibility of error to patients and families, regardless of whether the \"risks\" were mentioned prior to initiating treatment (3). ***module=35 page=1_10.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 1_20.htm Unexpected outcomes challenge physicians Physicians are disappointed and uncomfortable with unexpected outcomes, error or not. They worry about how to talk about them, and about blame, uncertainty and judgments. Physicians have very high expectations of themselves, quite apart from their ideas of the course of a particular treatment or procedure. Unexpected outcomes without error are rather common, so both patients and clinicians often have experience with them and can call on familiar coping strategies. (4,5) On the other hand, when a clear error of any kind results in some unwanted outcome, both patient and physician experience great discomfort. The patient's trust is shaken. The presence of error challenges the physician's sense of personal and professional integrity. They ask themselves, \"Where did I go wrong?\" \"How could I miss the early warning signs?\" They may experience feelings of shame, doubt, sadness and anger at themselves. Some common concerns of physicians include questioning the identity of the final arbiter of right and wrong care: who is to judge what appropriate care should be in an individual case? And, since so many errors occur without adverse consequences, how \"negative\" must the consequences to the patient be before the physician is obligated to discuss the error with the patient? In addition, many medical errors have complex origins, involving teamwork and \"systems\" problems. Who is \"to blame\"? Page: 2_00.htm MUST PHYSICIANS DISCLOSE? Ethical and professional standards require that physicians discuss unexpected outcomes and disclose errors. Disclosure is a responsibility based on the intrinsic fiduciary relationship between patient and physician, and is supported by contemporary ethical standards, and accrediting and professional bodies (see below). Furthermore, a clinician who has deceived a patient may not be defended or \"covered\" by his malpractice carrier. In court, \"deception\" may be a matter of perception rather than \"proof\". Honesty is the best policy (6,7). Not surprisingly, most patients and families want and expect physicians to discuss problems with treatment promptly and honestly (8,9). A personal, non-defensive and open discussion usually reduces feelings of betrayal and distrust, and anger is often soothed, making the sadness and disappointment more tolerable. Mandate to disclose: - Joint Commission (10): requires hospitals to have an explicit policy and procedure for the disclosure to patients of adverse events, complications, with and without error. - American College of Physicians: \"Physicians should disclose information about .errors...if (it) significantly affects...the patient. Errors do not necessarily constitute improper, negligent, or unethical behavior.\" (11). ***module=35 page=2_00.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 2_10.htm Disclosure is unsettling Physicians fear conversations about disclosure, and they are often ill-prepared for them. But cover-up and deception have worse consequences. Physicians' fear of negative consequences from disclosing errors begins early, and pervades the current culture of medicine. In one study, only 54% of residents who made a serious mistake reported it to their faculty attending (12). Physicians often react in a \"fight or flight\" way, based on spontaneous emotional reactions that we hope will protect usbut which seldom are effective, and may actually worsen the situation. We may try to distance ourselves or minimize possible errors: \"We all make mistakes...it's hard to be perfect \" Another defense mechanism is discounting or displacing responsibility: \"The hospital does not have enough staff bad illness patient did not comply \" Sometimes we attempt to refute even the possibility of error through denial: \"Medicine is more art than science there are only differences of opinion.\" Of course, there is usually some element of truth in these statements (13). Fear of disclosure operates between residents and faculty as well as between peers, and concealment leads to the problems of secrecy such as fear, anger and retaliation if secrets are discovered. In addition, guilt, shame and withdrawal induced by \"cover-up\" inhibit learning and quality improvement. Physicians in teaching institutions and physicians who are members of interdisciplinary medical teams have a special obligation to model and teach appropriate disclosure and discussion of unexpected outcomes. ***module=35 page=2_10.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 2_20.htm Coping can be improved Denial, minimizing and deflecting blame can and should be replaced with intellectually honest, supportive and reflective collegial conversations. Physicians have many concerns about how to discuss unexpected events, and little experience in managing the difficult emotions that arise. Physicians usually feel disappointed, and the prospect of a complex and emotion-laden discussion or even a verbal attack increases personal and professional discomfort. They worry about the impact on their lives and practices, teams, institutions and relationships. In part because causality may be hard to assess accurately, unexpected events raise physicians' doubts about their own performance, and physicians worry that disclosure could awaken the patient's awareness and suspicions, increasing the likelihood of a malpractice claim. If you feel you have made a serious error, it can be very helpful to talk with a trusted colleague. Tell your colleague what happened, and your worries and feelings about it. Many errors are errors in retrospect only, and many times your colleagues may tell you they would have made similar decisions. If you made a clear error, talking with a trusted colleague can help you think clearly about it, help you forgive yourself, and learn from the mistake. Denial and avoidance of your feelings can keep you from learning and may prolong your own emotional suffering. Also, in this new era of disclosure, discussing the error with your hospital risk management director can be quite helpful in providing perspective and helping you to prepare for the disclosure conversation. ***module=35 page=2_20.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 3_00.htm \"EXPECTATION MISMATCH\" AND INFORMED CONSENT The informed consent process helps assure that physician and patient share expectations and basic understanding of the situation, and minimizes the chance of expectation mismatch. When introduced a few decades ago, informed consent seemed almost a formality, a \"cover your butt\" piece of paper with some mention of risks, and a signature. This has changed, and present professional and ethical expectations are that the informed consent \"form\" certifies that patient and physician have shared an open and frank (but not brutal) discussion. Physicians use their best communication skills to inform patients as collaboratively and empathically as is feasible. Physician and patient should have a similar idea of what is most \"likely\" to occur, and also of what could occur, negotiating expectations along the worst case-best case spectrum to prevent mismatch (14,15,16). In some institutions it is unclear whose role it is to obtain informed consent - physician, nurse, resident, or clerk. The physician is ultimately responsible for the care delivered. Consequently, patients (and lawyers) consider the informed consent process to be the physician's responsibility, regardless of who obtains the patient's signature on the informed consent document. ***module=35 page=3_00.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 3_10.htm Informed consent conversations include complex elements The consent discussion explores perspectives, options, and uncertainties, and also requires tailoring of information and thoughtful documentation. Such conversations cannot prevent disappointing outcomes, but may minimize mismatches and subsequent distrust and conflict. Module 17 presents informed decision in depth. Here we will offer a brief summary: Patients need a clear framing of the clinical issues, and discussion of options for diagnosis and treatment, with clarification of their benefits and risks. Explore uncertainties associated with the diagnosis and treatment as thoroughly as possible. Take time to explore the reasons why either patient or physician thinks certain alternatives are not \"acceptable\" (17). - Explore the patient's (and family's) perspective (Module 9). Include their ideas about the nature of the disease, concerns about treatment alternatives, prior experience with healthcare, and potential conflicts based on different cultural or social expectations, in order to tailor the care and anticipate future difficulties. - Tailor information to the patient's needs and interests in order to establish a shared understanding and mutually agreed plan of action (Modules 10 and 11.) - Be certain that patients have ample opportunity to raise concerns, especially as you approach closure (Module 12), and that they are able to summarize the plan in a way that demonstrates their understanding. - Documentation is always important. Clearly a signed consent form is required for procedures, certain drugs, and surgery. However, conversations for initiation of complex treatments, such as with multiple antibiotics or cardiac medications or for hyperthyroidism should be documented in the medical record, even when no signature is required. An effective informed consent dialogue does not prevent disappointing outcomes, but it assures that the patient and physician have shared their thoughts and concerns about the goals and potential risks of a course of treatments or a procedures. The process strengthens relationship bonds and supports trust, especially in the event of a tragic or very unexpected outcome, with or without medical error. Those bonds and the increased trust permit subsequent conversations to be more open, more dignified and more empathic in spite of the distress (3,18). ***module=35 page=3_10.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 4_00.htm UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES: ARRANGING DISCUSSION After unexpected outcomes, attending physicians should initiate discussion promptly, arrange an appropriate private setting, engage families, and ensure seating for all participants. Assist residents and obtain administrative support. In this section you'll find the following topics covered: ***module=35 page=4_00.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 4_10.htm Begin dialogue prior to treatment Conversation about unexpected outcomes begins prior to treatment, continues during active treatment, and picks up where it left off if unanticipated events ensue. Prior to treatment, the informed consent process serves to minimize misunderstanding and mismatched expectations. During active treatment, the dialogue includes discussion of treatment goals, progress and future planning, with description of any deviations from the expected course of treatment and active elicitation of patients' concerns. ***module=35 page=4_10.htm*** Module: 35 | Arrange meeting promptly As with any \"bad news\" conversation, arrange a meeting as soon as possible, and if telephone discussion is required by the circumstances, tell the basic facts that demand a face-to-face meeting for further talk. Don't wait for all the \"facts\" or for a complaint or question. \"I don't have all of the information yet, but I need to tell you what I do know at this point. We will meet again as more information is available.\" You may be inclined to postpone, but delays usually magnify problems, and may be perceived as an attempt to conceal or obfuscate issues. ***module=35 page=4_20.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 4_30.htm Private setting Talk in a private area, such as a conference room, office or private patient room, and close the door. If conversations begin unexpectedly in a public area such as the emergency department or a hallway, have everyone take a breath and locate a more private area. Privacy is far more important than any inconvenience. Assure seating for everyone, and be especially certain that the physicians are seated (M 14). ***module=35 page=4_30.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 4_40.htm Engage the family Explore family roles and care-giving relationships, and respond to the family dynamics, conflicts and differences. The importance of families cannot be overstated, both in the informed consent process and in the event of unexpected outcomes. Family members' roles differ enormously (Module 20, 32-34), but elicitation and documentation of certain basic information is essential if conversations about unexpected outcomes are to be successful. Find out what family members, friends, and other physicians have said and advised. Make an effort to identify difficult relationships and differences of opinion within the family. Make notes about how well you know the family members, their relationships and the living and care-giving arrangements that include the patient. Clarify what involvement the patient and individual family members feel is beneficial, appropriate, and desirable. When there are differences of opinion or if family ideas are in possible conflict with what you think, discuss these in an open manner. (M20) ***module=35 page=4_40.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 5_00.htm DIALOGUE STRATEGIES AND SKILLS Bring assistants when discussing serious problems, and assure that any residents who lead such conversations have specific training and guidance. All staff participants should be prepared: read the chart carefully and know not only the facts of the case but also know which issues remain as yet unclear. Whenever there is serious injury--with or without error--a second person, preferably from hospital administration, is essential to witness the conversation, facilitate, support the patient and family, and coordinate follow-up. In a non-teaching institution, the attending or covering physician at the time of the event takes responsibility for initiating and leading the discussion. In a teaching hospital or clinic, initiation and leadership depends on the severity and acuity of the situation, the experience of the resident, and any special characteristics of the institution. Inexperienced residents should be adequately prepared and accompanied by a senior resident or faculty physician as they conduct the conversation. Students may be present, but should not lead discussion. In serious cases, or where there is possible or obvious error, the faculty physician takes the lead, and negotiates the role of the resident before the meeting. ***module=35 page=5_00.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 5_10.htm Serious injury Bring assistants when discussing serious problems, and assure that any residents who lead such conversations have specific training and guidance.

In discussion with other personnel, decide who will review the situation, who answers clinical questions, and how to describe different roles. If there are administrative issues and concerns or financial questions, enlist help from administrative personnel. Do not attempt to answer questions you are unsure of, such as whether the hospital will pay for prolonged care. \"I don't know how to answer your questions about the extra cost, but I will find the right person for these issues.\" Physicians appropriately anticipate conflict and difficulty when joining the patient and family for discussion of unexpected outcomes. Take a mindful approach and notice your own emotions. Remember prior related events, and especially those when you were in the shoes of patient or family. Remember how and from whom you obtained support then, and anticipate who will support you now. You might begin with deep breaths or other strategies (Module 2, 4) to help settle feelings and calm your mind. ***module=35 page=5_20.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 5_30.htm Dialogue elements and sequence Take responsibility for introductions, a compassionately delivered opening statement of bad news and an apology. Follow up with a clear summary, attentiveness to patient and family concerns and acceptance of them, check for understanding and continue to respond with empathy. Take the lead, introduce everyone, and then review their roles and relationships. Warn the patient/family. \"I am afraid I have some bad news.\" Then, a simple initial apology and brief explanation informs people of your compassion and respect for their strengths, which is very helpful at the outset of a complicated discussion. Patients and families depend on and expect professionalism. At such times of disappointment a professional demeanor includes and demonstrates both attentiveness to others and thoroughness regarding the details. Do not hurry, and especially in situations when you feel urgency, do not allow this to override your attentiveness or give an impression of casualness. Review the course to date (diagnosis, goals, choices made and why). Recall the informed consent dialogue, but do not suggest that the disappointing event should come as no surprise (it always does). Describe the event succinctly but clearly and pause, indicating your interest in questions and responses. Check for patient and family understanding, and clarify and resolve any differences that emerge. Anticipate common concerns and ask about them, even if others do not initiate discussion. \"What questions do you have about why this happened when things were going so well?\" Listen for and understand the core of the patient's distress, remembering that their concern may not be immediately obvious, or obscured by confusion or other emotions. Reflect and respond to the emotional messages you are receiving and this will help the patient find her core emotions and express them. Strive for accurate empathy. \"This is a complex situation. What worries you most?\" Conclude the conversation with a joint discussion about the future. Include a negotiation of the immediate goals and expectations of care and possible complications or risks, and arrange support and future meetings as needed. \"If you have no further questions, let's talk about the coming days \" ***module=35 page=5_30.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 5_40.htm COMMON DIALOGUE DILEMMAS With a careful approach and skills practice, physicians can avoid common communication problems, such as premature reassurance, responding defensively, failing to apologize, and neglecting to talk about who will take continuing responsibility for the patient's care. In this section, the following issues are covered: ***module=35 page=5_40.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 5_41.htm Premature reassurance Premature reassurance hinders open dialogue, while empathy and acceptance build trust. Do not offer premature reassurance, because this is often interpreted as minimizing the experience of the patient and the family. \"I wish I could reassure you that everything will be all right, but I am afraid this might be premature.\" Empathize and fully accept disappointments and doubts, using reflective listening and other relationship building skills that foster trust (M6, 13) When patients feel understood, upset feelings are soothed. On the other hand, failing to acknowledge strong feelings, trying to minimize them, or turning away from feelings to the facts, even in an attempt to reassure, usually exacerbates strong feelings and hinders open dialog. When the patient indicates he feels that you do understand his distress, review any good news that exists. \"I know that this is very worrisome, but I would also like to describe some reasons for hope.\" ***module=35 page=5_41.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 5_42.htm Feeling defensive Defensive feelings are normal, but expressing them blocks supportive discussion. Avoid the natural tendency to defend yourself. Express empathy and respect instead of your own defensive feelings. \"It must be hard to trust us after what has happened.\" Defensiveness evokes suspiciousness and distrust. Defensiveness has the effect, if not the intention, of appearing to place yourself and your position at the center, in a time of crisis for the patient. Remember that they are the ones who are sick, no matter how sick at heart you may feel. ***module=35 page=5_42.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 5_43.htm Offer apology Apology is difficult and complex. Genuine apology is compassionate and expresses sincere concern. Physicians often worry that their apology is an admission of fault, or may be construed as an admission of \"guilt\". The simplest \"apology\" might better seen as a statement of compassion and concern, or a general expression of sympathy for the situation. \"I am sorry about what you have been through this week.\" \"I am sorry things turned out this way\". Such statements are effective at conveying concern, do not constitute any admission of responsibility and are very important to patients (19). A more complex \"apology\" underscores the fact that you take personal responsibility for your work. \"I am sorry I did not contact you sooner about the laboratory results.\" \"I am very sorry that I nicked the bile duct during surgery.\" Clearly this does convey both remorse and responsibility. When there is error involved, this kind of statement is uncomfortable to deliver, but is very reassuring to patients and effective at allaying their worries about your honesty, trustworthiness and potential betrayal of your fiduciary relationship. When there has been error, patients expect an apology, and failing to apologize angers people, sometimes increasing the likelihood of conflict and future claims. In court, your apology is \"discoverable\". However, should problems come to court, it is better to have previously acknowledged the discoverable issue than to have it discovered during the litigation process, which convinces people that you wanted to conceal facts and avoid taking responsibility, and increases their anger and vengefulness. ***module=35 page=5_43.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 5_44.htm Assure continuing care Verify that patients see that you will take responsibility for ensuring a continuing care relationship. When situations turn out badly, patients are very apprehensive about feeling abandoned. If they sense distancing from you, they become angry and more litigious. You and the patient may not have a prior or continuing doctor-patient relationship. If the possibility exists for one, maintain a continuous dialogue and relationship with the patient and family. \"We should talk about the days to come. I need to stay in close communication with you so that you can understand what is happening and I can hear and address your concerns.\" If this is a one-time encounter such as an emergency department visit, clarify and reinforce the role of the primary care or specialty physician who will be assuming care, without minimizing your involvement in the present situation. \"It is important that I speak as soon as possible with your primary care physician so we can assure continuity of care.\" ***module=35 page=5_44.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 6_00.htm TRAGIC OUTCOMES AND ERRORS Unexpected death, any major complication or any error produces very strong emotions and reactivity is high. Physicians need support setting up and conducting conversations about tragic outcomes. In conversations regarding \"major\" complications or clear errors, emotions and disappointment are stronger, particularly the physician feelings of defensiveness, denial, guilt, remorse and concern about malpractice suits. The strategies and skills described above for unexpected outcomes are appropriate and relevant, but certain elements deserve more emphasis. Your first priority should be to seek help and advice, particularly to help identify and manage your emotions, and to help you remain mindful of the total picture, not just the present events. Take the time to review the case before you start the discussion, with a focus on what must be done at this time and what and how much is best to discuss. Review any training you received on how to respond to and discuss unexpected outcomes and errors in the context of your own institution. Talk with your risk management department, your immediate clinical supervisor or department chair, or other appropriate personnel. ***module=35 page=6_00.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 6_10.htm Honesty, detail, criticism, and empathy Dilemmas common to tragic situations include the question of amount of detail needed in the conversation, avoidance of unnecessary controversy, and avoidance of blaming language when another physician or institution is involved. Honesty is never wrong, and apology, acceptance of responsibility and avoidance of hedging and blaming are fundamentally important to showing that you care deeply about the patient and family, but judgment is required regarding the level of detail to provide. Remember that too much detail can increase confusion for non-physicians and make people think there is more that you are covering up. Describe facts and answer questions willingly. Be certain to use language that acknowledges and defines areas of uncertainty. \"There are some things we know for sure and others which remain unclear \" Dishonesty (real or perceived) is noticed, and breeds distrust. Apologize. Be sincere. Accept responsibility without detailed self-critical analysis. Save self-criticism for forums other than with the patient and family; your clarity about what did happen is more important than what might have been. Do not make statements about what you \"should\" have done, such as, \"I really should have reviewed the literature more carefully and maybe obtained a consultation.\" Avoid conjecture that might imply blame. \"It's hard to know exactly what I would have done if I had been there I'm afraid we will have to wait until the situation has been fully investigated.\" Empathize with disappointments, without taking a position. \"The impact of this is just so terrible .I wish I could tell you exactly why this all happened.\" ***module=35 page=6_10.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 6_20.htm Transfer, attorneys, discovery Offer to transfer care; never talk with patients about your conversation with attorneys or insurers, and remember that all conversations are discoverable except for Quality Assurance proceedings. When major problems occur, someone always wonders whether a transfer of care is appropriate. Even if patient or family do not bring it up, offer this option as a compassionate response to the pain and other strong emotions that are near the surface. Your offer acknowledges that a natural human reaction might be that continued healthy collaboration could seem too difficult for the patient to manage. Such a respectful offer will not be misinterpreted. \"I would like to remain your physician, but I understand you may have some feelings about this. If you would like, I will help you find another physician.\" Never discuss with the patient any of your consultations with attorneys, personnel acting under attorney's direction, or your liability insurer's personnel; these must be kept confidential. Any potential or pending disciplinary actions against you or other medical personnel must similarly be kept entirely in confidence. \"I am afraid I cannot discuss what the hospital investigation has found, but I am happy to answer whatever questions I can.\" The proceedings of Medical Staff Peer Review committee meetings and case review are protected. However, outside of this protected Quality Assurance arena, the content of informal discussions and meetings such as Morbidity and Mortality conferences are potentially discoverable. ***module=35 page=6_20.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 7_00.htm SUPPORTING COLLEAGUES The dynamics of supporting colleagues are complex. Do approach your colleagues with empathy and respect and in a non-judgmental fashion. Simultaneously, help discover as much of the truth as is possible under the circumstances. Unexpected outcomes are discussed often by physicians and other healthcare professionals. Discussions range from \"morbidity and mortality\" conferences and hall-way conversations to peer review root-cause analysis and institutionalized support groups. Some resemble an inquisition, others an academic exercise, still others a means of condolence. Conversations among colleagues should mirror those with patients and families: prompt, respectful, honest, empathic, problem-solving, supportive, and with a focus on learning for the future. Physicians have specific needs when an error occurs. Carrying life and death responsibility can be lonely, and is never simple. Physicians feel disappointed and unhappy, and appreciate the opportunity to say so. Physicians need to understand what went wrong, and how to prevent it in the future. They need to feel understood and supported by colleagues, in both their feelings and their medical practice. Establishing a balance between dealing realistically and honestly about questions of clinical judgment while avoiding contributing to a physician's feeling of shame or guilt is as delicate a process as talking with patients and families. When talking with a colleague who has had a serious adverse outcome, build trust and relationship that can support a frank exploration of the situation. Express empathy. \"I can imagine you feel pretty badly about this.\" Keep it simple; wait for your colleague to respond and do not minimize. Try to facilitate understanding of the case, when and if appropriate. Ask permission first. \"If you'd like, I would he happy to talk about the case with you I wonder what happened \" Avoid shame and alienation. \"I've made some bad mistakes and know I felt pretty badly afterwards. Still, I hope you don't feel too ashamed to talk with me about the case. I've always respected your judgment and this won't change our relationship.\" Support your colleague, without condescension. \"What can I do to help you get through this? I want you to know I value our partnership.\" ***module=35 page=7_00.htm*** Module: 35 | Page: 8_01v.htm Two movies about having a dialogue with an angry patient who suspects you of being the cause for her suffering Click on the picture-button above to see a movie how not to deal with an angry patient who suspects you of being the cause of her suffering.

Mobile patients, practice ownership and structure, continued specialization and insurance and financial fluctuations mean that more frequent and disruptive transfers of care are taking place than ever before. Physicians who learn to manage such transfers skillfully minimize the adverse consequences for themselves and their patients. Case 1: Dr. C has cared for Mrs. N, 68, for over 20 years through pneumonia, a myocardial infarction and ischemic colitis, as well as through the death of her husband and estrangement from her daughter. She views Dr. C as her doctor, supporter, counselor and friend. Over lunch, a friend mentions that Dr. C is leaving town for an academic position. Arriving home alone, Mrs. N is anxious and upset. What will she do without Dr. C.? And, why didn't Dr. C have the courtesy to tell her himself? Dr. C. and Mrs. N. shared a continuous relationship, coming to know each other as doctor and patient and as persons. Continuity of relationship is a cornerstone of primary care, supporting benefits such as patient and physician satisfaction, improved health outcomes and cost savings (1,2,3). An ongoing trusting relationship enables both physician and patient to better confront future challenges. (4) Today, the vagaries of insurance plans and \"networks\" make it increasingly difficult to maintain continuity in relationships. Fewer primary care physicians establish their own practices and many seek new opportunities or feel compelled to do so because of the intense business orientation in offices. Patients are also mobile, and relationship continuity is further limited by frequent changes in what (and who) their insurance plan covers. Paperwork, bureaucratic delays and hassles translate into dissatisfaction that result in patients requesting new physicians, and physicians, in exceptional circumstances, choosing to dismiss a patient. How do doctors and patients react when the bond between them must be broken, and can we learn to predict, recognize and understand these reactions? In this module we will explore a variety of communication strategies to manage the consequences of disruptions, terminations and transfers of care. (5,6) 03_00.htm ATTACHMENT AND SEPARATION IN THE MEDICAL SETTING Biologic attachment drive creates strong bonds between people who care for each other. When a physician breaks bonds by leaving, patients commonly experience separation anxiety. Either tenuous or over-dependent relationships complicate separations and provoke amplified requests for attention or alternatively, excessive independence and noncompliance. Case 1 (continued): Mrs. N discovered a breast lump several weeks ago, and is unsure why she put off making an appointment--now she wonders if she will be able to see Dr. C before he leaves. Her anxiety grows as she considers facing breast cancer without her trusted physician. Bowlby described attachment theory, a framework for understanding responses to disruptions of caring relationships as, \"a way of conceptualizing the propensities of human beings to make strong affectionate bonds to particular others and the many forms of emotional distress and disturbance to which unwilling separation and loss give rise.\" (7) Attachment behaviors serve the biologic purpose of establishing relations of care and nurturance for the very young, the frail and the ill. When these bonds are threatened or broken, separation anxiety is a common response (8). It peaks during the second and third years of life, but typically resurfaces during times of stress such as illness and hospitalization, or the feelings of helplessness and dependency that Ms. C. encountered as she discovered a breast mass and contemplated separating from Dr. C.(9) Case 2: After learning that her physician would be leaving town in several months, Ms. P, age 40, canceled her next appointment. In a letter she told her physician that saying good-bye in person would be too difficult. Most patients have appropriately trusting, open and secure relationships with their physicians. (10) Attachments are more tenuous for others reflecting earlier relationship difficulties leading to either excessive independence and denial of interpersonal connections (\"I don't need you anyway\") or amplified requests for attention, care and nurture. For Ms. P, the supportive and stable relationship with her physician was a stark contrast to the abuse she suffered as a child. The prospect of separation was, at least transiently, overwhelming and threatening. ***module=36 page=03_00.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 03_10.htm Interview strategies when accepting new patients Mrs V's difficulties in case 3 remind physicians that specific questions that help patients address \"termination syndrome\" consequences can smooth the transition to the new practice. When seeing a new patient, the alert clinician will keep in mind that patients may carry unresolved sadness, anger, or anxiety stemming from the loss of their prior physician and this may influence the patient's willingness to establish a trusting relationship with you. At the initial visit, ask how the patient feels about prior physicians. Specific questions include: - \"What did you find particularly helpful or useful about your relationship with Dr. L?\" - \"What do you miss about Dr. L?\" - \"How have you done since Dr. L. left and were you prepared for her/his leaving?\" - \"What do you want our relationship to be like? This will be helpful for me to know as we begin our work together. \" These questions are a novel starting point for negotiating a new relationship which incorporates what the patient values from the previous one. This relationship-centered inquiry communicates your interest in feelings and openness to interpersonal matters. ***module=36 page=03_10.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 03_20.htm Termination Syndrome Psychiatrists have long appreciated that patients may respond to termination of the psychotherapeutic relationship with anger, sadness, anxiety, missed appointments and flares of psychiatric and/or somatic symptoms. This \"termination syndrome\" has also been observed in primary care. (11,12,13) Case 3: Soon after her physician moved to another city, Ms. V, age 54, repeatedly phoned the emergency number of her HMO requesting urgent care for \"pneumonia.\" The on-call physician obtained a history consistent with viral bronchitis and suspected that her symptoms were amplified by anxiety. Physician: \"It sounds like you're really worried about this cough.\" (Naming an emotion) Patient: \"I just don't know what to do. I need to talk with someone.\" Physician: \"I notice from your chart that you were Dr. L's patient. He recently left the practice.\" Patient: \"I always counted on him to be there for me.\" Physician: \"It sounds like you miss him and that makes this illness a lot more frightening.\" (Naming an emotion) Patient: \"Right. Now I don't know what to do.\" Physician: \"I can appreciate how difficult this is for you. I'm new to the practice and would be happy to take you on as a new patient. How does that sound to you?\" (Validation) (Partnership and Support) Patient: \"I'd be so relieved if you would. Thank you!\" The on-call physician correctly recognizes that Ms. V's anxiety is connected to the recent loss of her primary care physician. Her symptoms and demands for urgent care are amplified due to uncertainty about who would care for her. The physician responds using basic empathy skills. (Module 6) Basic empathy skills include: - Name the emotion: \"I can see this news is pretty upsetting to you.\" - Legitimize the patient's response: \"After the many years that I've been your doctor, I appreciate that my leaving raises many concerns for you.\" - Support/Partnership: \"We will work together in being certain we have identified a new physician before I leave.\" - Respect for the patient's feelings: \"You've been a great patient and I've enjoyed your doctor.\" ***module=36 page=03_20.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 04_00.htm PATIENT RESPONSES TO LOSS OF A PHYSICIAN Patient care may suffer, adherence may decline and symptoms may increase if separation precipitates excessive anxiety, sadness, anger or loss of self esteem. Separations are particularly destabilizing for patients with chronic illness, psychiatric disorders, social isolation and for those who have had a dependent or conflicted relationship with the physician. Case 4: Soon after learning that his physician, Dr. W. would be leaving, Mr. H. began calling the practice frequently for medication renewals, to report new and \"worrisome\" symptoms, and to demand an immediate response from his doctor. Dr. W. was concerned that a flare of medically unexplained symptoms might indicate a missed diagnosis or perhaps a relapse of the patient's substance abuse. It was difficult for her to return the patient's calls, especially with the added time demands of closing her practice. The frequent visits and shared experiences that accompany complex medical conditions build relationships and trust that are not easily transferred to another physician. Vulnerable patients express their anxiety, sadness and anger through a variety of behaviors. Like Mr. H, the wish to keep the physician from leaving is expressed through the \"body language\" of physical symptoms and requests for care. Other common reactions include: - Anger: Accusations that the physician is irresponsible or uncaring. - Sadness: Worsening of an underlying affective disorder, withdrawal and low self-esteem (\"I'm not worth taking care of\"). - Anxiety: Heightened somatic awareness with misinterpretation of normal physiologic processes as symptoms of disease, and urgent requests for care - Gaining Control: \"Leaving before I'm left\" (Case 2. is an example). - Denial of emotional response: (Case 5) - Deterioration in adherence to care plan and resumption of risky behaviors ***module=36 page=04_00.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 04_10.htm Interview strategies that minimize the impact of transfer of care Initiate discussion, tell patients sooner not later, raise the topic early in an encounter, listen attentively and legitimize the full range of potential negative emotions. Consider this discussion as similar to the delivery of \"bad news\" and use similar strategies. - You must initiate discussion about the impending separation, even if reluctant to spend time this way. Whatever the patient's response, listening and observing in an accepting and nonjudgmental manner helps patients recognize, explore and resolve the loss. Incoming physicians will be especially grateful, because these talks help patients avoid maladaptive behaviors that bedevil attempts to establish a new therapeutic relationship. - Tell patients you are leaving sooner, not later. One approach is to inform patients as soon as your decision is certain. Another is to tell patients no later than their next to the last visit, but vulnerable patients will benefit from being told earlier which allows more time for emotional adjustment and logistic planning. Waiting until the last visit does not provide time for patients to process their responses and plan for the future. - Doctors, like patients, can inadvertently leave important topics to the end of the visit. Make your leaving a specific agenda item and bring it up early in the visit so that you have time for dialog. The pitfalls of ending an encounter with, \"Oh, by the way, I'll be leaving the practice next month\" are obvious. - Listen in a nonjudgmental, open and non-defensive manner, and be particularly attentive to negative emotions. Expressing so-called \"negative\" emotions may be easier if patients are told that it is not unusual to feel anxious, angry, or abandoned when their doctor leaves. This statement invites patients to speak honestly and openly, and often helps them resolve prior conflicts with the doctor and move forward with their care. - Employ communication strategies similar to those used in breaking bad news. - Begin with a brief, clear statement that you are leaving and when; avoid elaboration initially. - After this statement, allow a period of silence so patients can assimilate the news and respond. If physicians elaborate or ask questions or provide reassurance at this time the intimacy created by sharing silence is lost. Physical touch provides connection and helps the patient stay with her/his feelings. Notice the patient's posture and facial expression. Body language such as slumped shoulders, downward gaze, or restless hands conveys the patient's reaction more clearly than words. - Off-hand comments such as, \"Oh well, that's the way things go for me,\" or a change of topic, are clues to the patient's feelings. Invite the patient to elaborate on this response. If the silence continues, ask something like, \"I wonder what feelings or thoughts you are having in response to this news?\" Occasional patients will not want to talk about termination, and your respecting this choice and patients' boundaries is appropriate. You can reassure patients of your continued willingness to talk, that all emotional responses are acceptable and that you will help them plan for the future. - Empathy skills: (described above and in M6 and Page: 05_00.htm PHYSICIAN RESPONSES TO TERMINATION Physicians should attend to their own emotional responses to saying good bye and cultivate awareness of how and when emotions may influence their decisions and behavior. The truism that \"doctors have feelings too\" is underscored when physicians say good bye to patients. Comfort with emotional and interpersonal issues, attachments to particular patients and conflicts with others influence physicians' responses. Sadness is to be expected but guilt, anger and relief are equally common. Cool or noncommittal patient reactions can wound the physicians' self esteem, particularly for residents just establishing their professional identity. Increased cynicism is an unfortunate result that can be minimized through reflection and discussion (Case 5. below). Saying good-bye to a large number of patients is always daunting, and even more so if leaving the practice entails additional administrative burdens (Dr. W. in Case 4). Physicians may intensify their medical focus and worry that they missed diagnoses or neglected preventive measures. Adding this concern to the prospect of multiple emotional interchanges may provoke physicians to procrastinate. ***module=36 page=05_00.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 05_10.htm Boundary issues in transfer of care - Patients may bring gifts of appreciation and may want to hug and kiss the doctor. As a rule, receive these signs of patient affection and gratitude with warm appreciation. A brief and gracious relaxation of the usual boundaries of the professional relationship is almost always appropriate. - When saying good-bye to patients it is appropriate to express your own feelings of sadness and to let patients know you will miss them. (14) ***module=36 page=05_10.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 06_00.htm TRANSFERS WHEN RELATIONSHIPS ARE TIME LIMITED OR INTENSE Relationships are predictably time limited in settings such as residency clinics, subspecialty consultative practices, HMOs, inpatient coverage schedules for teaching attendings and for the full time hospitalist. In many settings, short-lived relationships are the rule. Patients may quickly develop intense bonds with hospital-based physicians (hospitalists), subspecialists and other personnel such as nurses and physical therapists. Hand-offs of care at shift change are mini-terminations. Preparing patients for changes in physician coverage and responding empathically to patients' reactions improves relationships and probably enhances both quality of care and patient satisfaction. ***module=36 page=06_00.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 06_10.htm Medium Time Scale The practice setting strongly influences the emotional and behavioral problems of physicians' departures. Patients anticipate the departures, but residents in 2-3 year clinics need guidance. Case 5: After a workshop on terminations and transfers of care, a medicine resident scheduled to complete training in 3 months tells a clinic patient that he will be leaving the practice soon. Afterwards, he meets with his clinic attending. Attending: \"So, how did the visit \"I said I was leaving and she just said, 'Oh, I expected that. Everyone knows that residents leave every three years.' She didn't seem bothered at all.\" Attending: \"How do you feel about her reaction?\" Resident: \"Well, it just shows that we residents are interchangeable. Patients seldom appreciate all that we do for them. I don't think I've made much of an impact.\" Three studies found that medical patients in resident clinics weather terminations with little change in appointment keeping and without reporting increased somatic complaints, in contrast to community practices. (15,16,17) The low rate of problems may reflect residents' efforts to inform patients and to insure smooth transfer of care. Furthermore, patients who understand that physicians change at least every three years may form a bond to the clinic rather than to the doctor, what Reider called \"institutional transference\". (18) This resident shows a reaction and response that carries a tone of disillusionment and a tinge of cynicism, as is common in this situation. ***module=36 page=06_10.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 06_20.htm Short Time Scale Physicians and patients bond quickly when patients are suddenly stricken, very ill or hospitalized. Consultants, specialists and hospital-based physicians should keep this in mind when leaving patients, even for a hand-off at shift changes. Case 6: Mr. R developed painful corneal erosions on a Friday afternoon while at a remote conference center. Initially very concerned, he was pleased and reassured by the evaluation done by Dr. O, an ophthalmologist nearby. Before leaving the office, Mr. R. asked what he should do if pain recurred or his vision worsened. Dr. O: \"My partner is on call this weekend. I'll bring him down to meet you and take a look at your eye. That way you'll have already met each other if a problem arises and he'll know what your eye looks like today. How does that sound?\" Mr. R: \"That's perfect. What a relief!\" Despite the brevity of their encounter, Mr. R. and Dr. O established a physician-patient relationship. Dr. O. recognized that to insure quality of care and to address Mr. R's concern, it was important to introduce the patient to the physician on call. ***module=36 page=06_20.htm*** Module: Page: 07_00.htm POSITIVE POTENTIAL OF CARE TRANSFER Separation is an opportunity for physician and patient to review important events and savor the value and meaning of their relationship, including acknowledgment of mutual affection, respect and care. Near the time of transfer, patient and doctor can review the \"ups and downs\" of their work together; and talk about times that have been challenging or difficult as well as those that have been successful and rewarding. Issues of trust and feelings of abandonment warrant explicit discussion. The patient's personal strengths, contributions, resources, and social supports can be emphasized, and termination can stimulate valuable growth and enhance the patient's sense of self-efficacy. The review often highlights personal and community resources for self-management, critical elements in the management of chronic illness. Patients can also reflect on what they value most in a doctor and consider these factors as they choose a new physician. ***module=36 page=07_00.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 08_00.htm DISMISSAL OF PATIENTS In rare circumstances and as a last resort physicians may decide to dismiss a patient from their practice, or patients may request transfer to a new physician. The behaviors and emotions that provoke these responses can be a source for improving physician-patient relationships, or may cause irretrievable deterioration of the relationship. Dismissals are typically considered for patients characterized as \"difficult\", \"hateful\" or \"heart sink.\" These labels are most likely to arise when there has been - repeated infringement of relationship boundaries, - disruptive or threatening behaviors, - a degree of continuous non-adherence that makes reasonable management impossible and is a risk to self and a liability to others, or - strongly negative emotional responses that the physician thinks will significantly cloud professional judgment.(19) In the past there has also been a tendency for patients who repeatedly present medically unexplained symptoms to be labeled in this way but this is no longer appropriate in the light of current understanding of somatoform illness. ***module=36 page=08_00.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 08_10.htm Interview strategies for deteriorating doctor-patient relationships Establish practice guidelines for dismissal; make relationship deterioration an explicit discussion topic, and consider the pros and cons of reconciliation versus dismissal. To begin, clearly describe the behaviors that cause serious concern and ask for the patient's point of view. Elicit the patient's goals and values, and do not focus on entrenched positions. Avoid arguments, counter attacks and defensiveness. As in all relationships, negotiation is more likely to succeed if the physician raises concerns before they reach the \"difficult\", \"hateful\" or \"heart sink\" level of intolerability. Depending on the setting, the intensity of the conflict and the participants' tolerance for negotiation, the benefits of a fresh start with a new physician may outweigh those of continued attempts at reconciliation. Outright threats to the physician or the practice are particularly intolerable. The personal challenge of skillfully responding to the strong emotions engendered is addressed in other modules. Physicians should write and honor practice-specific guidelines for dismissing patients, and review and implement them prior to taking action. It is prudent and helpful to review concerns and decisions with trusted colleagues, and to enlist support from practice managers, an ombudsman, patient advocates and/or a patient relations office. (20) ***module=36 page=08_10.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 08_20.htm Dismissal of physicians Dismissal may also be initiated by a patient who is dissatisfied with care and requests a new doctor. Frequently cited reasons for dismissing physicians are behavior that is dehumanizing, rude, uncaring, impersonal, unresponsive, incompetent, dishonest, or belligerent. (21,22) A patient's request for transfer presents an opportunity to reassess goals, values and boundaries and potentially discover mutually acceptable approaches to better communication, better relationship and better care. ***module=36 page=08_20.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 09_00.htm DEATH OF A PATIENT Death is a special instance of leave taking, and an opportunity to extend compassion to the family; a meaningful letter of condolence may produce important benefits for the bereaved. Death of a patient means saying good bye to the patient and in many cases acknowledging and responding to bonds with the patient's family. Attending the patient's funeral or visitation acknowledges the patient's value and is an opportunity to grieve the loss. Sharing feelings and memories with the family or colleagues facilitates the mourning process and comforts both family and physician. Case 7: Mr. E, 33, died on a general medicine unit from complications of chronic hemodialysis. The attending physician wrote to the family expressing his condolences and availability. Several weeks later the patient's sister requested an appointment and described overwhelming grief and guilt since her brother's death. \"If only I had donated my kidney he would still be alive.\" After responding to her grief, the physician reminded her that her brother was not deemed an acceptable transplant candidate. He scheduled a meeting with the nephrologist, who answered her questions and further relieved her guilt A letter of condolence communicates personal involvement, human connection and availability. (23) It extends compassion to the patient's family. If there is no communication, families may wonder, \"Where did the doctors go?\" In case 7, the physician's extension of caring and availability provided relief, and may have prevented an extended bereavement response or depression. Bereaved survivors, especially a spouse, suffer increased morbidity and mortality after a loss. Increased attention to the emotional, social and medical needs of the bereaved may mitigate the risk. Practice suggestions for a Letter of Condolence (24) - Acknowledge the loss and name the deceased - Express your sympathy - Note special qualities of the deceased - Recall a memory about the deceased - Remind the bereaved of their personal strengths - Offer help - End with a word or phrase of sympathy ***module=36 page=09_00.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 10_00.htm PLANNING FOR TERMINATIONS AND TRANSFERS OF CARE Planning for separations includes meeting specific ethical obligations and a careful review of a physician's patient panel to identify patients especially vulnerable to disruptions in care. Departures from or closing a medical practice increase the workload and are emotional and stressful times for practitioners, staff, patients, and others who may be involved. If mishandled, terminations can significantly disrupt continuity of care as well as office routines and efficiency. Physicians should facilitate teamwork with practice managers, nursing and support staff that will allow everyone to contribute to smoother transitions. Forethought and planning prevents discontinuity and disruption and improves patient satisfaction. Physicians who leave a practice must attend to the following ethical obligations: - Inform patients of major changes (such as the physician leaving the practice). - Notify patients sufficiently in advance (at least 30 days) to secure other medical care. - Inform patients how to contact the departing practitioner. - Facilitate patients' ability to choose a practitioner from among those in the practice or outside, within existing constraints. - Tell patients how to obtain copies of or transfer of their medical records. In settings such as resident clinics where turnover is predicable, patients should be informed early that their physician will leave when training is finished. Patients requiring special attention and planning for social, psychological or medical reasons should be identified early. Advance planning is necessary for patients with complex illness and chronic diseases. Vulnerable patients should be contacted and encouraged to schedule an appointment prior to the physician's leaving. Give special consideration in choosing a new physician for patients with limited English language skills or other cultural preferences. Patients without a scheduled appointment and not at special risk for separation problems can be informed of the practitioner's leaving by phone call or letter. (Appendix 2). The letter should fulfill the obligations listed above. Office personnel can provide a sense of continuity in clinics where physician turnover is high. In resident clinics, attending physicians can help smooth transitions in care. - Provide the patient with (or direct them to) information regarding transfer of medical records and other logistic matters. - A patient's new physician should be identified by name and introduced to the patient, when possible. A personal meeting of outgoing and new physicians allows the sharing of information, especially about interpersonal issues or others that might result from the transfer of care that even the best transfer note cannot adequately convey. ***module=36 page=10_00.htm*** Module: 36 | Page: 11_00.htm APPENDIX 1 Table1: Difficult Emotional Responses to Termination of the Doctor-Patient Relationship PATIENT DOCTOR Sadness Sadness Anger Anger Separation Anxiety Guilt Feeling abandoned Relief Diminishing self esteem Emotional Fatigue Denial Denial Discomfort with ambivalent/negative feelings Discomfort with ambivalent/negative feelings Disillusionment with medical care and doctors Cynicism about lack of patient appreciation Uncertainty about future caere Embarrassment about patients' gifts Anxiety about being judged by incoming physician Table 2: Behavioral Responses to Termination of the Doctor-Patient Relationship PATIENT DOCTOR Missed appointments Procrastination Decreased adherence Failure to inform patients about leaving Increased somatic complaints Hurried attempts to complete work-ups Difficult bonding to new doctor Avoidance of emotional issues during interview Giving gifts Over/under involvement ***module=36 page=11_00.htm*** will be leaving the ___name of practice__ on ____date___.

STAGE is a mnemonic for a framework that guides learners in developing their oral case presentation skills, and also guides faculty in providing feedback to learners. Teachers and learners can utilize the STAGE framework to review key elements of oral case presentations, to model or practice delivering them and to give or request feedback on presentations. Check out the video example where Dr. Monroe describes the goals of this module. This module advocates for augmenting instruction in oral case presentation, and reviews key concepts and the STAGE framework, through text, video and exercises. ***module=37 page=0_00.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 1_00.htm OVERVIEW Advancing students master the primary components of oral case presentation: structure/content and style of delivery. Students who master the novice level can extract key information from the patient's narrative, organize information chronologically, and use a structured presentation style. Effective novices are able connect the facts into a chronological, relevant and condensed medical narrative. More advanced learners understand what listeners typically need in order to engage quickly with unique features of a case, to rapidly understand the clinical issues and to construct a differential diagnosis. The advanced presenter uses this understanding to filter, sort and organize the data so as to deliver a succinct, organized, compelling and engaging presentation. As an advocate for the highest quality of care for the patient, the presenter wishes to provide listeners with essential facts so as to achieve the best possible outcome. The advocate's central task is to organize data from several domains, including a) the patient's current symptoms and story, b) relevant psychosocial and behavioral factors, c) important physical findings, d) and relevant laboratory , radiology and other data. Advanced presenters balance the need for thoroughness against the helpfulness of succinctness, and omit details that might be interesting, but not relevant to the patient's central issues. ***module=37 page=1_00.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 1_10.htm Similarities and differences between written and oral presentations While both types of presentations document the relevant data to support diagnosis and treatment, there are important differences. The written writeup is comprehensive while the oral presentation is focused and concise. Written and oral presentations each thoughtfully organize the patient's narrative into a coherent and sequential HPI and utilize the same format and information. The information includes subjective data elicited from the patient, family and records, and objective data from physical exam, laboratory and radiology. The written record is more expansive about narrative details and symptoms, and also more thoroughly describes past problems, potential future problems, psychosocial details, review of systems and comprehensive physical and laboratory exams. ***module=37 page=1_10.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 1_20.htm Basic principles for oral case presentations The oral case presentation is a brief edited presentation of the essential information using a standard approach. However, it is not uniform, and its content depends on audience, setting and goals. Use notes and practice at first, so as to develop proficiency and efficiency in this aspect of clinical care and clinical education. Not only do oral presentations differ from written, but the length and amount of detail are influenced by the audience and setting (medicine attending rounds, a surgery consult request, obstetrics and gynecology walk rounds, pediatrics evening sign out), and the goals of the oral presentation (teaching, patient care and/or evaluation of clinical skills). A full medicine presentation in attending rounds should be under 5 minutes. A presentation in the hallway on walk rounds on surgery should take no more than 1-3 minutes. Students are often uncertain what is expected, and so should check with supervisors to clarify expectations. Check out the video example about the importance of practice Students' initial oral presentations should be written, practiced and then delivered with minimal dependence on written notes. Advanced students will be sufficiently familiar with varied formats and sufficiently engaged with the details and management of their patients that they will eventually not need notes to organize and concisely present appropriate essential details. ***module=37 page=1_20.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 1_30.htm Standard format for the oral case presentations Novice medical students focus on the seven basic components of the standard case presentation, which form the STORY of the presentation. Advanced students add an eighth component, the Plan for the primary problem plus an Assessment and Plan for additional active problems. As your basic science, physical exam skills and clinical problem-solving skills increase, the requirements of your oral case presentations will also grow. You will expand the formulation section of the case presentation to include the differential diagnosis and a plan for evaluation and treatment. Check out the video example about format and content expectations for novice and advanced learners - The Opening Statement (Identifying information/chief complaint ID/CC) - The History of Present Illness (HPI) including relevant information from Review of Systems (ROSthese include symptoms related to the major and adjacent organ systems, constitutional complaints such as fever and weight loss and epidemiological risk factors or exposures) - Other active medical problems - Selected Elements of Past Medical History - Selected Hospitalizations/surgeries (relevant to HPI) - Medications/OTC/Herbal remedies - Allergies (reaction) - Brief Social History (current situation and major issues only and tobacco, alcohol and substance use) - Physical exam (pertinent findings only) - Formulation/Summary statement of the primary problem (includes differential diagnosis) - Plan for primary problem and Assessment/Plan for each additional active problem (for advanced level) Advanced presenters use clinical reasoning to guide the structure and content of oral case presentation, organizing and prioritizing information based on what you think are the patient's most likely diagnoses. ***module=37 page=1_30.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_00.htm STAGE FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING EFFECTIVE ORAL CASE PRESENTATIONS STAGE is a structure that incorporates the standard format for oral case presentations with tips for guiding you in creating and tailoring your oral case presentations. The elements of STAGE include: Story/Style, Timing, Audience, Goals, and Eliciting Feedback Check out the video example where Dr. Monroe names and describes the elements of oral case presentations. The sections below provide additional annotations and guidance for creating and tailoring oral case presentations. ***module=37 page=2_00.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_10.htm STORY The first element includes both the Story and Style. The Story contains the standard seven or eight components listed below. - [Opening Statement] (Identifying Information/Pertinent Illnesses/Chief Complaint) - [History - [Plan for primary problem]and Assessment/Plan for each additional active problem (for advanced level) ***module=37 page=2_10.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_11.htm Opening Statement (Identifying Information/Pertinent Illnesses/Chief Complaint) This element is the Story headline and engages the listener, states the presenting problem, and introduces the patient as a person. The identifying information includes the patient's name, age and -sex (gender is a social construct that relates to how one defines one's role and identity in society, sex connotes biology only and is the preferred termthis explanation is not for inclusion in the paper), and the presenting complaint in his/her own words, with the apparent duration of the complaint. At times it states other past or active medical problems relevant to the main problemand if so, lists them only by diagnosis, as the \"HPI\" or \"other medical problems\" elements provide more details. Ask for help in deciding whether to state other active problems when this is not obvious. Do not include race or ethnicity unless it helps listeners weigh diagnostic possibilities differently. Avoid editorial comments and distracting informationin particular, do not give any detail about other medical problems. Check out the video example about content of opening statement including CC Contrasting Examples: (Providing editorial comment and too much detail): Mr. Jones is a difficult but unfortunate 35 year old man with a complicated social history, his active problems include diabetes mellitus complicated by retinopathy and nephropathy, COPD with FEV1 of 1.5 liters, coronary artery disease with EF 50%, who presents with a chief complaint of abdominal pain for 3 days after going on a drinking binge. (Improved): Mr. Jones is a 35 year old who presents with abdominal pain for 3 days following one week of heavy drinking. His active problems include diabetes mellitus, COPD and CAD. Listeners will be distracted by the interesting comments and details in the initial example. The improved example does not interrupt listeners train of thought between the chief complaint and the history of present illness. Relevant information about the problems might be stated in the \"HPI\" or \"other medical problems.\" Additional Good Examples: Mr. Mason is a 47 year-old man with a 10 year history of diabetes mellitus who presents with a chief complaint of nausea and vomiting for 3 days. Mrs. Hernandez is a 50 year-old woman who was electively admitted for evaluation of increasing shortness of breath over 5 days. Her active problems include sarcoidosis and hypertension. Mr. Jones is a 22 year old man who comes to the clinic for follow-up of daily headaches. ***module=37 page=2_11.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_12.htm History of Present Illness (HPI) The HPI element begins with a general statement of the patient's health prior to onset of the current illness then tells a chronological story that includes details about the important symptoms. Begin the HPI with an introductory statement of prior health/function, and follow this with a chronological reporting of the illness story. This introductory sentence typically follows the following format: Mr./Mrs./Ms.____ was in his/her usual state of (excellent health/poor health) until (three days/weeks) prior to admission when she (suddenly/gradually) developed (pain/fever/wheezing). State times relative to admission (e.g., 3 days prior to admission), instead of reporting that an event occurred \"on Saturday\". Check out the video example where Dr. Monroe demonstrates HPI Good Examples: Mr. Boone has a long history of chronic obstructive lung disease and home oxygen therapy. He was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission, when he developed gradual worsening of his shortness of breath, associated with a cough productive of yellow sputum and a fever of 102. Mr. Ryan has a long history of coronary artery disease including three myocardial infarctions, the most recent in 2004, and congestive heart failure. He was in his usual state of health, with angina occurring once per week, until the night of admission when, while watching a football game on television, he suddenly developed severe substernal chest heaviness. In the HPI, characterize the major presenting symptoms, state what the patient thinks is causing the symptoms (his attribution), and mention any prior episodes, complications and the relevant Review of Systems (ROS) questions (include both pertinent positives and negatives). If there was any evaluation of the chief complaint prior to hospital admission, include this also. A useful memory aid to help characterize symptoms is OPQRST + Associated symptoms: Onset, Provocation/Palliation, Quality, Radiation, Site/Severity, Temporal featuresTiming including constancy, duration, frequency, changes over time (progressive, stable or improving); previous similar episodes; + what else happened- for example, if the major symptom is wheezing, describe associated cough, pain, fever, rash, and so on.. Give relevant Past Medical History, Social History, Family History contributing to HPI. The positives and negatives from Review of Systems are usually pertinent to the differential diagnosis. Contrasting HPI examples: (poorly characterized and too brief) admitted for evaluation of chest pain. He was well until three weeks prior to admission when he began to feel chest heaviness whenever he exerted himself. He saw his local doctor who prescribed antacids with little benefit. The pain woke him last night so he came into the emergency room for evaluation. His other problems include . (symptoms characterized and relevant past history, family history, ROS and other details added) admitted for evaluation of chest pain. He was in his usual state of good health until one week prior to admission when he developed the gradual onset of intermittent chest pain, characterized as substernal heaviness which radiated to his jaw and left arm, lasting about five minutes per episode, occurring several times a day, aggravated by exertion and relieved by rest. Associated with the pain were shortness of breath and sweating, but no nausea. One week prior to admission he was seen by a local doctor who, without other testing, diagnosed gastritis and prescribed antacids without benefit. The chest pain was stable until two hours prior to admission, when the patient awoke with a more severe version of the same pain that lasted until he came to the emergency room. He was quickly transferred to the coronary care unit. There was no history of cough, heartburn, weight loss, fever, or chills. The patient has a positive family history coronary artery disease, a cholesterol of 310 in 1998, and has never smoked cigarettes. ***module=37 page=2_12.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_13.htm Other Active Medical Problems Learning which problems to state in an oral presentation, learning the \"key words\" that apply to describing different illnesses, and learning what is \"irrelevant\" for a particular oral presentation is complex, and must be learned in the context of active participation with more experienced physicians. Other active problems include the same problems mentioned in \"Opening statement\". For example, diabetes mellitus is relevant for a patient admitted with angina. Consider each condition separately and recount details chronologically; for example, first explain the history of coronary disease, telling the story from the beginning to the present, then discuss his peptic ulcer, and then his COPD. Present information on a series of problems in order of importance, with most important first. his other medical problems include insulin-requiring diabetes for 12 years and complicated by retinopathy, painful polyneuropathy, and nephropathy. His recent creatinine was 1.7 .. Use \"key words\" and phrases to summarize an ongoing chronic illness in this section. In general, key words emphasize date of diagnosis, its treatment, current symptoms, complications, and recent objective tests. Appropriate \"key words\" vary with the nature of the problem, and you learn these with clinical experience and by listening to more experienced clinicians make oral presentations. .history of multiple abdominal procedures including appendectomy, cholecystectomy and hysterectomy, and insulin dependant diabetes with target organ dysfunction . .long history of chronic obstructive lung disease with steroid dependence and the requirement for home oxygen therapy, a 1994 FEV1 of 0.8L, and three hospital admissions for exacerbations in the last year. He has never been intubated two year history of congestive heart failure, felt to be secondary to alcohol cardiomyopathy, characterized by chronic one block dyspnea on exertion, three pillow orthopnea, and ankle edema. In addition to his long term therapy with furosemide and enalapril, digoxin was added six months ago. An echocardiogram four months prior to admission showed four chamber enlargement and global hypokinesis with ejection fraction of 35% Avoid presentation of \"irrelevant\" diagnoses. Like \"key words\" what is \"irrelevant\" is seldom obvious to novices. For example, \"syphilis in 1940, malaria in 1952, cataract extraction in 1972, and cholecystectomy in 1987\" are usually irrelevant during presentation of the patient with diabetes and crescendo angina. ***module=37 page=2_13.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_14.htm Past Medical History (PMH) Include all of the patient's problems in your write-up, but refrain from orally presenting problems not relevant to the current active problems. Select which hospitalizations and surgeries to include. List all prescribed medications (have information on dosages available), and any relevant non-prescription medications and herbal medications. Of course, you will only be able to give as much detail about medications as the patient can give you, unless you have the patient's chart or office medication list. Report any drug allergies and the type of reaction (for example, \" developed a rash after receiving penicillin 20 years ago and carries the diagnosis of penicillin allergy\"). ***module=37 page=2_14.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_15.htm Social History (current situation and major issues) Every person has a complex social history; summarize it in a brief paragraph (2-3 sentences). The social history often explains why the patient has fallen ill or decided to seek care now. For example, patients may lack social support and the help needed to follow plans, few financial resources to buy medications, or depression that retards their taking action. If unaddressed, these factors lead to hospitalizations. Comment on current life situation including habits, work, living environment, and support systems, and important stressors. Include information about advance directives (living will and durable power of attorney) and any discussion with you about these issues. Summarize substance use, but if mentioned in the HPI, do not repeat it. Include tobacco, alcohol and other drugs (including abuse of prescribed drugs). State amounts, frequency, and duration; and include intravenous use, past or present. Relevant information regarding Family History and Review of Systems has usually been incorporated into other elements of the Story. ***module=37 page=2_15.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_16.htm Physical Examination Report of physical examination findings always includes a general description, vital signs and both positive and negative findings pertinent to the admitting problem and active diseases. Check out the video example where Dr. Monroe demonstrates report of PE This aspect of oral presentations includes several elements. Begin with a general description paint a word picture so listeners can visualize the patient. \"The patient was sitting on the edge of the bed, leaning forward and gasping for breath\" is better than \"the patient was short of breath.\" Always state the vital signs, and mention relevant postural changes in blood pressure and pulse. After the word picture and the vital signs, limit presentation to relevant positive findings and relevant negative findings. An example of 'negative findings\" in the dyspneic patient would be that \"the exam is remarkable for clear lungs bilaterally.\" Use concise but complete descriptions of positive findings. ***module=37 page=2_16.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_17.htm Formulation/Summary statement of the primary problem (includes differential diagnosis) The formulation synthesizes pertinent data into a problem title from which the differential diagnosis is derived. This synthesis takes the following form: \" the patient's presenting problem is wheezing/abdominal pain/urethral discharge. Then state \"The differential diagnosis includes a/b/c. The diagnosis of c appears to be most likely because of x, y, and z.\" ..the patient's main problem is a crescendo pattern of exertional chest pain, now prolonged at rest, which could be due to a myocardial infarction, a dissecting aortic aneurysm, pericarditis, and other diagnoses such as pneumonia, pulmonary embolus, or esophageal disease. MI seems most likely, because his description of chest pain is classic for angina and because his ECG reveals a new injury current in the inferior leads. ***module=37 page=2_17.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_18.htm Plan for primary problem and Assessment/Plan for each additional active problem (for advanced level) As you advance, your presentation will include specific plans for confirming a diagnosis, instituting treatment for it and monitoring the progress of the illness. For each active problem, you will present an assessment, including differential diagnosis (if diagnosis not known) and plan. ..to diagnose the MI, I recommend a cardiac enzyme panel and repeat ECG in the morning. We have ordered ASA, B-blocker, ACEI, a statin and consulted cardiology for consideration of angiography and intervention. The patient is on continuous ECG monitor and frequent vitals. In addition, the uncomplicated diabetes is well controlled on insulin. The hypokalemia is probably due to chronic use of diuretics but may be induced by the stress of this acute illness. Replacement potassium has been ordered along with a repeat blood test . ***module=37 page=2_18.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_20.htm STYLE Style, which includes appearance, demeanor and nonverbal signals, strongly impacts the quality of your oral case presentation. - Modulate your voice and cadence of your presentation. Every patient is unique; capture the special elements so as to engage the listeners. Paint a word picture of the patient. - Stand up straight and make eye contact so as to connect with listeners. - Do not bury your nose in the chart; and do not read verbatim your presentation. - Become enthusiastic about this patient, and show your engagement with the situation. - Rehearse and know the situation well enough to feel confident and show it. In the case of inadequate time for preparation, say so, only once, and be confident about what you do know. \"Sweating bullets\" severely limits your learning and that of others. - Avoid distracting \"Um's/Ah's\" during your presentation- silent pauses are always preferable to \"um's\" - No one likes to listen to repeated nonsense syllables or fillers, such as, \"ok\", \"maybe\", or \"the patient said that .\" Eliminate verbal \"tics\" from your repertoire. - Learn from colleagues, attend to presenters who engage you and make the exercises fun, then imitate them. Think of a sport, or a jazz ensemble. ***module=37 page=2_20.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_30.htm TIMING Timing is influenced by expectations specific to the setting of your oral case presentation. Specific courses, clinical settings, and supervising residents or attendings impose differing expectations for the duration of a presentation. Ask supervisors and instructors about their expectations and preferences for length, conciseness, and when they prefer summary versus details. Observe your colleagues. Mostly people want to help learners. Complex medical issues, busy clinical services and other demands on your instructors may require your attentiveness and may influence the timing of your presentation. ***module=37 page=2_30.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_40.htm AUDIENCE/SETTING Presentations typically occur in the conference room, hallway or bedside. Each audience and location requires adjustments to your presentation. Check out the video example about seeking clarification of audience/setting Bedside presentations require attention to the patient and family and usually include an invitation to them to add to or edit the information in your presentation. While bedside presentations may seem difficult or awkward, studies confirm strong patient preference for them and, with practice, growing learner preference, too. Following a bedside presentation, it is important for you to check with the patient in order to clarify or resolve any questions related to your presentation. Make additional adjustments related to special audiences (grand rounds versus daily work rounds), to the degree of privacy available, and to how well listeners already know the patient. ***module=37 page=2_40.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_50.htm GOALS The specific goals of a presentation determine the details of content, length, and organization. Common situations that call for important alterations in oral presentation include arranging cross coverage, informing the team of new admissions, and formative or summative evaluation of learner skills. Consider whether the goal is to promote patient safety and high quality patient care, to promote group learning, or to perform for an evaluation of your knowledge and skill.. ***module=37 page=2_50.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 2_60.htm Elicit Feedback Feedback on presentations enables you to obtain information from different observers, utilize ideas derived from multiple perspectives, make targeted adjustments, and check on whether you are advancing your skills. Check out the video where Dr. Monroe reinforces reasons for eliciting feedback Feedback provides important information about how to adapt your approach in the future. More feedback is better than less, and immediate feedback is preferable to feedback that is delayed. The following strategies can assist in structuring and organizing feedback. - Self-assess each component of your presentation in light of the STAGE framework. - In advance of a presentation, establish your colleagues' (and faculty) expectations about the Story, Timing, Audience adjustments, and Goals. - Share your self-assessment (strengths and opportunities for improvement) and request feedback on the accuracy of your self-assessment. - From both junior and senior colleagues, solicit feedback and suggestions about a specific component of the STAGE framework. - Develop a plan for improvement and specify a time to follow-up with faculty regarding your progress. Asking for feedback - Greeting: \"Hi, how is the day going for you? Is this a good time for you to give me some feedback on my oral case presentations?\" - Share your self-assessment of your presentation: \"I think I have a handle on how to construct an opening statement and chronologically convey key information in the history of present illness, but I am unclear on whether I am including all the appropriate pertinent positives and negatives. \" - Solicit observations and suggestions, in advance: \"Would you be able to comment on the appropriateness of my inclusion and exclusion of components of the past medical history, social history, and family history in the present illness?\" - Solicit observations and suggestions, afterwards: \"What went well from your perspective? Could you give me some suggestions on how to improve?\" - Make a plan for follow-up: \"Would you be able to listen to a presentation in a week to comment on my progress?\" - Express appreciation: \"Thanks, that was especially helpful because ***module=37 page=2_60.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 3_10.htm Exercise #1: 47 YEAR OLD MAN WITH CHEST PAIN Part A: The interview Observe this brief interview (4:41) of a a standardized patient with chest pain by a third year student. - As you listen, attend to \"S\", the \"patient's story\", and focus on the story content and chronology - Take notes, if note-taking will help you remember key details - How well did the student gather information about all 7 elements of the patient's presenting problems and past history- a more or less complete STORY? - What is the chief complaint, and what are the key elements of the history of present illness? - How would you construct a medical version of the patient's story? - What do you think is the cause of the patient's symptoms? - Construct your own case presentation using the historical data from this interview.

Click [here]to see how Dr. Monroe gives feedback on Jimmy's presentation. ***module=37 page=3_20.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 4_00.htm COMMON MISTAKES IN ORAL PRESENTATION Improving presentation skill requires a disciplined and systematic approach that includes improving knowledge about what an excellent presentation looks and sounds like, and practicing with peers and faculty to aid you in identifying and trouble shooting problems. Common problems fall into two broad categories: first, informationfailing to summarize, organize and transmit coherently huge amounts of information (this requires learning a new jargon); and second, \"delivery\"-- failing to maintain connection and relationship with listeners. - Labored rhythm, with little audience contact - novice students typically have difficulty tracking all the information and tend to present in a wandering, disorganized and/or desultory fashion. Maintaining eye contact with your listeners means that you should not read your write-up verbatim, and instead use notes. The skill to convert a written history and physical examination into a compressed presentation requires practice, like any other skill. At first, take the time to practice it two or three times in advance. For most learners, it is helpful to find a classmate or resident who can spend a few minutes listening, give you feedback and watch you try again. Most learners also benefit from audio-taping (or video-taping) in order to gain personal insights. Like any skill, this one is easier for some students than others; so some advanced students may need to continue practicing. - History of present illness too brief - 90% of correct diagnoses come from the history alone; so do not sabotage your listener's understanding of the case by omitting important information. The HPI portion of the oral presentation, as a general rule, should take 1/3 to 1/2 of the presentation time. Common pitfalls include incomplete characterization of major symptoms, reporting lists of symptoms instead of a chronological story, omitting pertinent negatives or positive ROS questions, and omitting specific information about past history that relates to the present problem. - Failure to use parallel reference points - in both write-ups and oral presentations, relate time in \"hours/days/weeks prior to admission\". Avoid \"at 2:00 in the morning of last Wednesday\" or \"on May 25th\"; instead, say \"three hours prior to admission\", or \"at 2:00 am, three days prior to admission\". - Editorializing - avoid comments like \"do you even want to hear this? \" or \"cardiac examination revealed a systolic murmur .well, I thought heard it, but the resident didn't so maybe it isn't there .I don't really know .\" - Use of negative statements instead of positive statements. Positive statements add color and accuracy to your presentation. \"Chest X-ray shows normal heart size\" is better than \"chest X-ray shows no cardiomegaly\". \"In summary, this patient's problem is acute dyspnea\" is better than \"the patient's problem is rule-out pneumonia\". - Unnecessary and repetitious descriptive sentences. Overly repetitious sentences become monotonous and lose the listeners. \"On pulmonary exam, the lungs were normal on cardiac exam, the heart sounds were , on lymph node exam, there were no cervical nodes \" is unnecessary your listener knows that S1 and S2 are part of the cardiac exam! Use brief descriptive sentences: \"an S3 gallop was heard at the left lower sternal border.\" - Disorganization Every novice learner has this problem. Because students are frequently encountering new illnesses, new twists on extreme human conditions and new situations for presentation, be aware that disorganization can happen even with careful preparation. Rehearsal, feedback, experience with multiple types of problems and situations, and attending to the structure of presentations you hear and admire will each help improve organization. If you sense that you are not on track, pause. Do not make editorial and self-referential comments like \"Oh, I can't believe I forgot to tell you this!\" Saying \" in summary, this patient wait, I forgot to tell you the most important thing \" will kill a presentation. Everyone forgets, and everyone has feelings of embarrassment too, so listeners will help you get all the data on the table, and help you reorganize it, but they will be less charitable if you spend presentation time making a big deal about shortcomings and talking about yourself. Be certain that you have the opportunity to talk with your supervisors about the shortcomings and the associated feelings in feedback sessions. - Lack of proper terminology for physical findings- for example, \"lymph node exam shows some small cervical nodes\" is not as descriptive as \" there were three soft tender mobile nodes in the left anterior cervical chain which measure 1 x 1 x 2 cm each \" Commitment to accuracy will improve your physical examination skills. - Naming a diagnosis instead of describing physical findings- diagnoses belong in the assessment, descriptions in the physical examination. For example, avoid \"exam showed the murmur of mitral regurgitation\" instead apex to the axilla\". Avoid \"skin exam showed psoriatic lesions on the elbows \"; and instead say \"there were several 2 cm. diameter round plaques with silver scale distributed on the extensor surface of the elbows \" ***module=37 page=4_00.htm*** Module: 37 | Page: 5_00.htm CONCLUSION Competent oral presentations help listeners and presenters maintain a high standard of patient care by facilitating coherent information transfer that is essential to high quality clinical reasoning about diagnosis, treatment, and teamwork. The STAGE framework can assist learners to organize information and to deliver it clearly in oral presentations, and STAGE provides a structure for practice and feedback.

The quality of teamwork and communication has demonstrable impact on patient outcomes, quality and safety, efficiency, patient and staff satisfaction, workforce retention and the capacity to improve work processes. [1] The stakes could not be higher. In this module, we examine relationships on healthcare teams and describe perspectives, attitudes and skills that any team member or team leader can use to improve both relationships and team performance. Most doc.com modules address relationships and effective communication between patients and clinicians, and we stress that application of these principles also enhances relationships between healthcare team members. ***module=38 page=0_00.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 1_00.htm HOW WE THINK ABOUT TEAMS How we think about teams profoundly effects our expectations and behavior, which in turn influences the behavior of others. In this section, we examine the assumptions and consequences of two common perspectives on teams, one based on hierarchy and control, the other based on relation and emergence. Beliefs about teams are remarkably self-fulfilling. The way we think about the roles of leaders and team members shapes our perceptions, expectations and behavior, which in turn influences how people behave toward us. Behaviors repeated over time become habits and habits become enshrined as social norms and team culture. We will consider two different team cultures, one based on hierarchy and control and the other based on relation and emergence. [2] Neither perspective is intrinsically right or wrong; rather, each is best suited to particular kinds of teams or situations. In current practice the hierarchy and control approach is used extensively so we highlight the alternative, which we call relationship-centered administration. ***module=38 page=1_00.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 1_10.htm Hierarchy and Control The hierarchy and control approach presumes that leaders know the answers and team members should do what their leaders tell them to do. This approach is detrimental to outstanding teamwork in most situations. According to the hierarchy and control perspective, the best path to a good outcome is to have a good plan, which the leader is responsible for preparing and executing. As a leader, you have control (exclusive decision-making authority) over a specific \"territory\" that can be defined geographically (e.g., an inpatient unit or office practice) or by function (e.g., quality improvement or information technology). People work on projects or make use of resources within that territory only with your approval. You control the activities of the team members, specifying what work they do and how they do it, and holding them accountable. Leadership is equated with expertise: you are assumed to have the greatest knowledge and skill in your domain. The role of team members is to carry out your directions, respecting your judgment and not getting involved in the work of other territories and teams without permission. The hierarchy and control perspective has the advantage of quick and orderly decision-making, is appropriate when a standardized process needs to be carried out with precision and dispatch, and without variability (e.g., the acute response to a patient in full cardiac arrest). Only one person leads, and conflicts over decision rights and jurisdiction are minimal. And with accountability resting with you, the leader, team members are spared the anxiety of taking personal responsibility for any of the group's failures. Nonetheless, we recognize limitations of this approach for the functioning of most teams. Concentrating authority and responsibility with you reduces the initiative and motivation of other group members. Communication and collaboration between teams is encumbered by the need to go through team leaders rather than directly between members of your respective teams. Unrealistic expectations of control create anxiety: when things don't go as planned, the ensuing struggle between you and your team members over who is responsible diverts attention and effort from the work at hand. The apparent simplicity and efficiency of hierarchical decision-making is often illusory. ***module=38 page=1_10.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 1_20.htm Relationship-centered Administration The relationship-centered approach involves paying careful attention to communication and relationship processes. The leader's role is to engage each team member's participation and creativity and to foster good dialog while also maintaining accountability. An alternative way of thinking about teams is the relationship-centered approach. This perspective assumes that best team performance emerges from good interpersonal process. As team leader, you attend closely to the quality of communication and relationships (a responsibility that the team members also share). You recognize that differences and unique perspectives are the source of creativity and adaptability, so you foster an environment in which individuals are comfortable bringing forth differing perspectives, explore each other's opinions and are open to being changed. Plans emerge in the course of the team's conversation and benefit from everyone's thinking. Using a relationship-centered approach, you strengthen commitment and motivation by engaging team members as partners, trusting and developing their capacity. You give team members wider latitude in determining how to do their work and in collaborating directly with members of other teams. You still hold authority and are responsible for maintaining accountability, but you do so in a relational fashion, for example, by negotiating individual goals and performance criteria. You view accountability as a form of service, an opportunity to help your team and its individual members realize their best potential. Occasionally you remove someone from the team, when you recognize and correct a mismatch of person and role that serves neither that individual nor the team well. Team members are responsible for participating in partnership, volunteering their observations and ideas honestly and respectfully. Leadership flows throughout the group. Anyone can suggest a new idea; anyone can make a reflection or suggestion to help facilitate the team's interactions. ***module=38 page=1_20.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 2_00.htm ATTITUDE Before we turn to methods that foster teamwork, we must first consider attitude, for the result of any strategy or skill that you use depends heavily upon the spirit in which you use it. Thomas Watson Jr, who built IBM, said, \"The basic philosophy of an organization has far more to do with its achievements than do technological or economic resources, organizational structure, innovation and timing.\"[3] We describe below some attitudes and basic philosophy that support outstanding teamwork. ***module=38 page=2_00.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 2_10.htm Improvisational team consciousness Thinking about meetings as an improvisational performance rather than a predetermined script facilitates collaborative group participation and the emergence of unpredictable and creative possibilities. We often come to meetings with our own personal outcomes in mind our plans, wants, grievances, opinions, data, spreadsheets, slides, and so forth. It's as if we're musicians who arrive to orchestra practice ready to perform our individual solos but not particularly interested in hearing what others play; or worse, only interested in listening to others for the purpose of critique and criticism. For a relational meeting you arrive practiced and prepared, ready to listen responsively to others and to support their performances like a jazz ensemble in which your own riff is highly influenced in the moment by what and how the other musicians are playing. The resulting improvisational performance is an emerging, synergistic creation that is greater than the sum of its parts an outcome whose specifics could not have been designed or predicted ahead of time. [4] ***module=38 page=2_10.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 2_20.htm Learner's mindset The willingness to adopt a non-expert stance and to continue to learn from others creates a respectful team environment, one that is unshackled from the mindset of \"knowing\". In our healthcare culture, the expert or 'knowing' mindset is an attitude that severely inhibits team function. We are all trained to be knowers, and clearly knowledge and knowing are important-- as responsible professionals, we must have a certain level of knowledge and skill. In team situations, however, the 'knowing' mindset can prevent us from listening and learning. Presuming that we 'know' the problems and solutions leaves little room for hearing other's thoughts or opinions, and even less room for combining our individual knowledge in creative ways. An alternative approach would be to hold your perspectives more lightly and to be willing to explore someone else's perspective even as you continue to hold your own. This mindset is often referred to as the humble learner's or 'beginner's mind' [5] It's an approach of curiosity and open-mindedness rather than dogmatic close-mindedness. It's the type of mindset you have when you come to a new situation, or that a social scientist brings to the exploration of a new culture or setting. It frees you from the shackles and burden of your own knowing and allows you to listen, learn, wonder, and grow. ***module=38 page=2_20.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 2_30.htm Value difference Members on high performing teams value their differences and respectfully challenge and disagree with each other, stimulating dialog and creativity. The voicing of differences is critical to creating value in an organization; for only through exploring our disagreements can we learn from one another. People too often sit in meetings in silent disagreement. Perhaps they do not care enough to speak up, or do not wish to challenge someone for fear of hurting their feelings, or perhaps they fear rejection, exclusion or humiliation. Indeed, it takes courage and skill to speak up honestly and respectfully to be truthful and also acknowledge other peoples' truths. This courage and skill are critical ingredients of meaningful conversations and productive meetings. In one very successful organization that we've studied, there's a saying 'if two people agree with each other then one of them is superfluous'. Difference stimulates new ideas and possibilities. Silent disagreement deprives others of the opportunity to receive important feedback, and foments anger, resentment and passivity. Silence also robs us of the opportunity to learn and grow through having our own ideas challenged. Check out the video example about \"value difference\" on the left. An alternative approach is to locate the courage to acknowledge how much you care, to offer your honest, genuine perspective in a respectful way that skillfully invites others to voice their disagreement in turn. Expressing yourself genuinely at meetings and encouraging others to do so enhances the possibilities for understanding and creativity. This approach values difference and diversity and creates an open and participatory environment. Passive resistance, the silent killer, evaporates. ***module=38 page=2_30.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 2_40.htm Appreciate capabilities of others An approach that appreciates capacities and successes, rather than one that focuses on flaws and problems, allows teams to create a better future by bringing along the best of their past. The word 'appreciate' has a number of meanings, including both to recognize the value in someone or something, and to increase the value of someone or something. Our experience is that individuals in organizations seldom do this we often underestimate the value of our colleagues and co-workers, much less elevate or increase their value. We look for flaws or problems without recognizing the good things, and we may also apply that same \"pathologizing gaze\" to ourselves. We rarely make the effort to assist one another in appreciating that value. Check out the video example about \"appreciate capabilities of others\" on the left. An alternative approach is one of appreciation. Experience and experiment have shown that the more capacity you perceive the more likely it is that people will rise to meet those expectations (a self-fulfilling prophecy). So in reflecting on your daily work and especially in promoting change, you can cast your attention out toward the positive what's working, what we want more of rather than towards what's not working.[6] During meetings you can value team members through recognizing each other's capacities and increase your value through acknowledging the team's successes. ***module=38 page=2_40.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 2_50.htm Become comfortable with uncertainty The ability to tolerate uncertainty and hold back the rush to resolution creates space for team members to brainstorm, present and tweak new ideas and implement creative solutions. One of the pitfalls of many meetings is the overwhelming desire to describe and quickly fix problems, to find solutions, to make decisions and check those items off the list. Our quest for control makes us anxious with uncertainty, because we equate uncertainty with incompetence, failure or difficult conversations and interactions. Too often in our rush to resolution, we focus prematurely and narrow our vision of the range of possibilities. In doing so, we miss the voices and ideas at the periphery innovations that are just the germ of an idea, or that might make little sense at first blush but which eventually could offer new solutions. We fail to allow space with uncertainty in order to see what new patterns might emerge. An alternative approach is to embrace \"not knowing\" to recognize that it can be a virtue rather than a fault. Removing the fears associated with uncertainty makes room for free-flowing brainstorming and open dialog, and allows a group to go beyond formulaic tools or approaches. It also lets a group recognize when it needs more time to simply sit with the question. ***module=38 page=2_50.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 2_60.htm Reflect on process Spending time on 'how we are working together' boosts efficiency by resolving inevitable frictions and misunderstandings before they become serious impediments to productivity. In our desire to be productive, our meetings often concentrate attention on the content of the work at hand. We're all about the 'what'. Rarely do we focus on the patterns of power and relating and the values we enact as we workthe 'how' of working together. Many dismiss such reflection as 'touchy-feely', 'navel-gazing' and a fruitless a waste of time. But what really wastes time and impairs team performance are conflict, misunderstanding and mistrust, nearly all of which is preventable and solvable if we take the time to reflect on how we are working together. An alternative approach is to recognize the importance of paying attention to relationships and communication processes. Exploring each other's perceptions and addressing the inevitable frictions and misunderstandings of daily work while they are still minor prevents enormous amounts of extra work. A regular discipline of reflecting on \"how we are working together\" can improve efficiency and save time. Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management scholars, described this type of activity as the most critical and primary responsibility of each and every individual in an organization. [7] ***module=38 page=2_60.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 3_00.htm COMMUNICATION SKILLS Our daily lives are packed with interactions as we work on teams, meet in hallways, and congregate at meetings. Each interaction is an opportunity to strengthen relationships, exchange information and generate ideas. This section describes skills that enhance your awareness, responsiveness and effectiveness as a supportive co-worker, meeting participant or team leader. The skills for effective clinical communication described in other modules of doc.com are valuable in fostering teamwork and relationship-centered administration. When we use these interactional skills in meetings and other conversations, we create patterns of relating that fashion and shape a relationship-centered culture within our teams and for the organization as a whole. ***module=38 page=3_00.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 3_10.htm Self-awareness You can learn to notice where you are focusing your attention and what assumptions and judgments you are making. You can be aware that an inner voice is distracting you and return your attention to what you are experiencing right here, right now. Have you ever noticed your mind during a meeting? So often an inner voice judges what is happening or rehearses what you intend to say next, or perhaps occupies your mind with ideas not related to the present interaction. These ever-present messages can be distracting and keep you from being fully present; or they can focus you on the present and your current experience. Whether they are distractions or insights depends upon your capacity to observe yourself your self-awareness. Self-awareness encompasses mindfulness of body, feelings and mind itself, as noted in Table 1 Table 1: Varieties of mindfulness (adapted from [8]) Types of Mindfulness Examples of self-observations Mindfulness of the body breath, contact, movements, communication via body posture, proximity to others; unpleasant and pleasant bodily states: arousal, \"sinking feeling\", churning gut, restlessness, \"goose bumps\" Mindfulness of emotions excitement, fear of embarrassment, anger, anxiety, heaviness, acceptance, (identification of your emotions may heighten sensitivity to others' emotions similar to counter-transference with patients) Mindfulness of mind alertness/attentiveness, distraction, associations, assumptions, fears, desires (for a further discussion of mindfulness and self-awareness, please see module 2) ***module=38 page=3_10.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 3_20.htm Active listening Active listening is more than passively receiving information. Reflect back what you've heard to show speakers that you understand what they are communicating. An inaccurate reflection will show them both that you are interested and that you've not yet understood. As a skilled listener you convey genuine interest through nonverbal behaviors such as posture, eye contact, head and body movements and facial expressions, and also through an open and curious line of inquiry. Expressing your curiosity by not steering conversation towards a premeditated goal allows speakers to lead you through their ideas and experience. Skillfully echoing speakers' phrases or paraphrasing what you've heard not only demonstrates your interest in accurately tracking their thoughts, but also creates an opportunity to discover what you do not understand to help you get back on track. ***module=38 page=3_20.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 3_30.htm Present your thinking Presenting your perspectives enhances both the diversity available to the group and the willingness of members to contribute to the dialog. Speaking your truth contributes to a culture of frank open discussion and serves to enhances that culture when your perspective differs from others'. Explain how you formed your opinion and give the data on which it's based. Take a moment to describe what meaning it has for you or what you have at stake. Your frankness can make it easier for others to speak up. Your transparency enhances openness, and encourages others to make their assumptions and reasoning available to all. ***module=38 page=3_30.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 3_40.htm Harness difference and diversity Diversity is valuable because it opens new and broader possibilities. Team members who manage to \"look out\" through each other's eyes understand situations more comprehensively and wisely than they could with a narrower, individual perspective. Underlying all our positions are assumptions, beliefs, rationales and logic. Striving for self-awareness of these underpinnings enables us to hold them up for examination. Making them available to inquiry by others and exploring the way others think can open us to new ways of understanding, which cannot be done if we \"dig in our heels\" and cling to \"the way it is.\" Maintaining a beginner's mind being willing to \"not know\" allows the differences to become the spark of a transforming new idea. Resist the common temptation to mistake difference for rejection or to make immediate judgments about what is right or wrong. Hold multiple perspectives simultaneously and stay engaged with exploration of differences so as to move beyond \"either-or\" and recognize more complex realities. Check out the video example about \"harnessing difference and diversity\" on the left. ***module=38 page=3_40.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 3_50.htm Stay engaged despite conflict Displays of strong emotions can evoke reactions that destabilize the group's focus. If we get defensive, lash back, give in to the temptation to withdraw or smooth over differences instead of responding compassionately, we miss creative or transforming insights. Seeking creative and transforming results inevitably surfaces conflicts between team members. Awareness of your own emotions, the ability to name them and a willingness to notice and name others' feelings is a crucial factor in group success. Acknowledging and naming your own or others' emotions helps groups creatively hold the tension of the conflict and re-open us to dialog. The willingness to hear each voice even when passionately expressed builds trust and gives the group the benefit of each member's truth. Both demonstrating respect and partnership using relationship-building statements (PEARLS see Table 2 below) and restating and checking common goals keep the team vital and restores its focus. Subjects that would otherwise become sources of discord and fractiousness become discussable. Even more, they become windows to deeper insights. Table 2: PEARLS build team relationships. Relationship statements, summarized by the mnemonic PEARLS, were presented in the context of the patient-clinician relationship (see modules 6, 13). These communication skills are equally useful for building relationships in teams. The chart below offers examples. (adapted from [9]) Partnership Collaboration and teamwork, common goals and vision, joint problem solving. \"We all want what's best for the patient. I know that we will figure this out together.\" Empathy Recognize and address emotion. Put feelings into words. Point out low/high energy levels. \"You look frustrated about this.\" Or, \"I'm feeling low energy right now, can we take a quick check on how others are feeling?\" Apology, Acknowledgement Admit errors, show concern for mistakes and take responsibility. \"I acknowledge that I should have contacted each of you sooner about this.\" Respect Give credits, appreciative comments and positive feedback. Value group members' behaviors. \"I appreciate that you've brought that point up. \"I'm impressed with the strength of your convictions.\" Legitimization Normalize and validate feelings, choices and responses. \"I don't blame you for feeling that way. Anyone in your shoes would feel the same.\" Support Maintain an optimistic, open attitude. \"I know we're going to figure this out. \"I'm willing to stay in conversation about this.\" ***module=38 page=3_50.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 3_60.htm Make process reflections Members who comment on group interactions can stimulate a team to adopt more congruent and transparent dialog patterns that contribute to both the team's cohesiveness and its effectiveness. Awareness of your own emotions or degree of engagement in the dialog can help you monitor other members' engagement. This tracking is the organizational equivalent of using your own feelings (counter-transference) to understand those of a patient. Take a moment to observe your feelings during a difficult or confusing spot, and then observe the other team members. Their posture, expressions and other nonverbal signs may help you discern their feelings and engagement. At such moments, you might notice incongruence between what you discern and what is being said; for example, expressing verbal agreement while showing disengagement through flattened voice tones or slouched posture. Disengagement sometimes indicates the presence of important issues that no one is bringing forth for discussion. Speak your observations as a method of calling attention to the team's current behavior and situation. This provides the group an opportunity to be more mindful of its own process, to consider new and more forthright interactive patterns and to regulate itself more effectively. Your transparency may stimulate members to develop their own self-awareness and communication skills. (See module 14 about \"nonverbal communication\") page=3_60.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 4_00.htm MEETING PROCESSES \"Microskills\" of relationship centered practices are intended to introduce and reinforce patterns of partnership and collaboration. They can help your team break out of frustrating patterns of relating so that meetings become more effective and engaging. In this section we hope to give you tips on improving your meeting performance whether as a participant or the chair. Executive skills such as time-keeping, rules of order or decision-making processes are important, but not our focus. [10] Instead, we describe meeting strategies that build on the attitudes and skills considered above. In meetings, how we interact and respond to one another can have more long lasting impact on outcomes and results than what we actually talk about. So it's worth learning interactive skills that respond to typical meeting dynamics and knowing that any new ways of participating that you employ may eventually diffuse and spread in ways that impact work in other areas of your organization. Meetings have a beginning, middle and end each with a specific purpose. We will consider each of these in turn. ***module=38 page=4_00.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 4_10.htm Beginning a meeting The first 10 minutes of the meeting, devoted to greeting, checking in and establishing agenda, set the stage for the tone and effectiveness of the entire meeting. Table 3 lists the opening tasks of a meeting and itemizes specific contributions for which the Chair and Participants should take responsibility. Chairs and participants who attend to these tasks bring team members together and address problems and concerns that can delay or derail the work if not managed early. We give more specific and detailed consideration to check-in and agenda negotiation in subsequent paragraphs. Table 3 Beginning a meeting Task Chair's Contribution Participant's Contribution Gathering Start/Stop on Time Greet participants as they arrive Ensure participants are comfortable Arrive on time or send advance notice if late Acknowledge and greet the chair and others in the room Welcoming, Introduction Make eye contact with all participants; thank them for coming Provide introductions for those who don't know one another Check-in (see text below) Introduce yourself to participants you don't know Clarifying, Negotiating the Agenda Agenda setting (see text below); ensure that purpose of meeting and agenda are clear to all participants; for additions/clarifications as needed Review agenda in advance Be prepared to speak to the issues Suggest additional agenda items relevant to the group ***module=38 page=4_10.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 4_11.htm Check in An intentional check-in supports a team's effectiveness by building trust, clarifying individual situations, removing distractions and attending to inclusiveness. Check out the video example about \"checking in\" on a team that meets on a regular base. Check-in is a simple technique which can achieve many things: - assist participants in transitioning from a previous activity and setting aside extraneous concerns and distractions; reorient and focus participants on this team's task. - improve trust and build relationships by helping participants know each other better. - invite every participants' voice into the room at the very outset; bring everyone together - enhance interactional skills that can improve team function Check out the video example about \"checking in\" on a team that meets for the first time. Table 4 outlines check-in formats, and includes sample questions. In each format, the chair and other participants should give each other the opportunity to \"pass\". Forcing people to self-disclose can diminish the sense of trust and safety in the group. \"Whoever would like to start, please do and others please join in as you are ready And as always, please feel free to pass.\" In the press of urgent business, it's often tempting to skip check-in to \"get on with the work.\" This is usually a false economy. Helping people get connected and calibrated makes the conversation more efficient and less prone to time-wasting distractions, misunderstandings and conflicts. Check in may occur before or after you negotiate the agenda. Experiment with this! Find out what your group prefers. Table 4: Several formats for check-in Name of Format When to Use Advantages Sample Questions Focused Personal Check-in Groups that are new to one another Trying to re-establish groups that have not been together for a while May help increase trust, improve quality of participation Can start the meeting in a way that includes everyone Questions can be chosen to increase sense of warmth, fun, competence of group members I am aware this group hasn't worked together before... Can I suggest we do a brief check-in to help us get to know one another a bit better? Whoever would like to start, perhaps you could tell us briefly what . was the highlight of your last vacation? was the most interesting thing you learned at the last course? is the best book you've read recently? Open Check-in Teams that meet regularly Allows for ongoing team calibration \"Who are we in this moment?\" as we begin our meeting Let's start with check-in whoever would like to start what would you like the group to know about where you're at today? Appreciative Check-in Teams that work together regularly Review agenda in advance Be prepared to speak to the issues Suggest additional agenda items relevant to the group I'd invite each of you to describe a moment of success something that's gone particularly well since we last met. ***module=38 page=4_11.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 4_12.htm Negotiate the Agenda Negotiating an agenda as a group ensures that everyone has the chance to clarify the \"shared purpose\" and content of the work. At the process level, this activity underscores the collaborative intentions of the chair. Negotiating an agenda facilitates sharing responsibility for managing the group's time and planning its work. Agenda setting is similar to the beginning of a clinical interview when you discuss the shared goals for the appointment, establishing the values of shared responsibility and collaboration. To negotiate an agenda, you can either ask for last minute changes to an agenda that has been sent out ahead of time, or you can receive suggestions to construct an agenda on the spot. Once all topics are listed, you can decide upon sequence and priority. If there are too many items for one meeting, you can decide together how and when to address the other items. Click on the picture-button above to see a movie on how not to establish an agenda. Click on the picture-button above to see a movie on an effective way to establish an agenda. ***module=38 page=4_12.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 4_20.htm Avoid Muddled Middles Meetings commonly derail or lose focus. The leader and all participants share responsibility for attempting to change an ineffective pattern by suggesting that participants try a new strategy. You're all checked-in; the agenda is approved. People are engaged, energy is high; you're moving through the agenda, making decisions and creatively exploring important issues. Meetings can proceed that smoothly, but sometimes they don't. We might find ourselves rehashing old issues or re-enacting ineffective communication patterns. Perhaps participation is low, or the same one or two people monopolize the conversation. The meeting gets sidetracked, energy drops. Table 5 presents some common stuck situations and suggests interventions for managing them. None is guaranteed to work but trying new interventions is essential when your current practices aren't working. Any participant (not just the chair) can suggest or utilize these techniques. Check out the video example of ineffective communication patterns. What patterns can you identify, and how would you remedy them within a meeting? Table 5: Methods for moving a team away from ineffective patterns Description of Ineffective Pattern Possible Interventionss Not enough time to explore issues properly; not everyone can contribute Parallel Conversations: invite pairs or other small group to discuss an issue for 5 minutes with or without \"reporting back\" (the additional discussion often helps move everyone along). Stories are effective experiences to share in dyads. [Click here for an example movie showing \"pairing up\"] Same people talk all the time; never hear from \"quiet\" ones Go Around: Each person is invited to take a turn to speak without interruption and always with the opportunity to pass or, if they are not yet ready to speak, to come back to them later. Disorderly conversation; many people trying to speak at once Talking stick: One can only speak while holding a symbolic \"talisman\" a ceremonial stick or bean bag or any other object. Sometimes a little structure helps to ensure hearing the full diversity of opinions and to slow down conversation enough to listen to one another. Click here for an example movie showing the \"talking stick\" Nominal group process: This variation on the Go Around is a rapid brainstorming technique. Proceeding around the room in order, participants make one brief suggestion at a time which is recorded on a blackboard or flip chart without discussion. The brainstorming continues for as many rounds as necessary until there are no further new ideas. Only then are the ideas discussed and evaluated. People continue asserting opposing views without listening to each other Balancing inquiry and advocacy: Effective group participation means inquiring in to the point of view and needs of others as ardently as you advocate for your own. It also implies a willingness to be changed by what someone else says. Peter Drucker, in his last published article, admonished executives to \"listen first, speak last\". [4] Participants are not saying what they are really thinking Naming the elephant: Giving voice to what is not being talked about. Describe the issue or the relational pattern in a descriptive and non-judgmental way, e.g.: \"I notice that we're not talking about whose staff is going to be cut\" or \"We haven't yet addressed the conflict that's in the room.\" You can also use a Go Around to ask \"what important things are we not talking about?\" Wicked questions: Sometimes there's a way of tilting an issue 180 degrees or coming at it from a paradoxical direction. For instance, instead of the question \"how do we find more time for our quality meetings\" you might ask \"how does paying so much attention to meeting about quality interfere with our ability to provide quality service?\" Or \"what would a system that was perfectly designed to fail look like?\" A wicked question usually starts with \"how\" often there is no clear answer. A good wicked question will help surface a paradox or tension which can be fruitful to explore more deeply. [11] Actively seek disagreement: \"I'll bet there are some other perspectives on this, and it would be valuable for us to hear and understand them.\" Conversation is jumping around without coherence; it's hard to know what is going on Reflective silence: give people 1-2 minutes of silence in which to gather their thoughts before returning to issue at hand. This can also be useful after a very intense and successful piece of dialog. Click here for an example movie showing \"reflective silence\" Meta-reflection: take a time out from the conversation for a Go Around inviting people to reflect on how the conversation is going. Reflective self-disclosure: As an alternative to observing what is happening with the group, it can be facilitative to observe what is happening for you. For example, \"I'm having this gnawing feeling in my stomach at this moment. Something is making me uncomfortable and I'm not quite sure what it is.\" Or, \"I notice that I'm feeling really antsy. I guess I'm hoping we can get into a deeper conversation.\" ***module=38 page=4_20.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 4_30.htm End Elegantly The end of a meeting is also the beginning of your subsequent work and of your next meeting. It's an opportunity to clarify commitments (a brief summary of actions and decisions) and to improve the team's capacity for feedback and working together. A brief debriefing or checkout is an effective technique for building relationships and helping the team \"calibrate\" how it's working together. As a meeting moves toward closure, summarize any agreements, decisions and action commitments that members made. Take this opportunity to ensure that everyone has a common understanding and remind people of their specific tasks. Rather than ending with that summary, however, a useful and stimulating practice is to conduct a quick debriefing or check out. The structure is similar to check in, and extends an invitation to participants to reflect on the meeting through a \"Go-round\" (with the invitation to pass) or \"popcorn style\" (in no order, each person speaks when ready). Check out the video example about \"checking out\" Participants have an opportunity to recognize one another's contributions and to give positive reinforcement to behaviors that contributed to the meeting's success. This consolidates learning and increases the likelihood that those behaviors will occur in subsequent meetings. Also, like check-in, it helps people get to know each other better and builds relationships. Table 6 presents several possibilities for the specific focus of a \"check out.\" Table 6: Suggestions for \"Check-out\" Type of Debrief Description Potential Benefits Appreciative Debriefing \"I'd like to invite each of us to check out by telling another person of a moment when that person said or did something that was helpful to you.\" Reinforces desired behaviors Builds positive regard among team members Builds team capacity by noticing and sharing what works Action Steps \"I'd like to go around with a check out and have everyone claim an action step they are committed to trying in the next week.\" Clarifies and consolidates commitment Ends meeting on positive note helps in transition from \"decision\" to \"action\" Personal reflection \"I'd like to invite each of us to check out with a brief word about how we were impacted by the meeting today perhaps something you will think about and carry with you until our next meeting.\" Helps team deepen understanding of one another Shows how shared events impact each one of us Provides opportunity for personal consolidation of meaningful experience Open invitation \"Let's have a brief checkout where are you at now that our meeting is drawing to a close?\" Invites personal reflection and calibration between team members Builds group \"history\" ***module=38 page=4_30.htm*** Module: 38 | Page: 5_00.htm SUMMARY A team is at its best when all its members can be fully present, holding the richness of their diversity as their most valuable resource, and when they can simultaneously influence and be influenced by each other. These are the conditions under which new ideas are most likely to emerge; this is the path to innovation and resourcefulness. And most important, participants' presence and openness to influencing each other makes the team's work effective, enjoyable, creative and meaningful. In this module, we've examined a comprehensive and practical framework for improving communication and partnership on teams, including attitudes, skills and strategies. Perhaps an effective way to summarize this material is to return to comparison of the hierarchy-control perspective and relationship-centered administration, and to fill in more detail (Table 7). Table 7 Hierarchy and control perspective Relationship-centered administration Leader's role Director, expert Facilitator, coordinator Leadership's focus The leader Shifts through the group Attitudes - Soloist - Knowing - Disagreement as problem - Correcting flaws - Valuing answers, certainty - Ensemblist - Beginner's mind - Disagreement as resource - Enlarging capacities - Valuing questions, not-knowing Skills - Advocacy (or telling) - Influencing others - Eliminating difference - Focusing attention on goals - Inquiry and advocacy (or listening and telling) - Being influenced and influencing others - Valuing and exploring difference - Focusing attention on the group's process and goals Meeting processes - Agenda set by leader - Task-oriented - Impersonal - Focuses attention on problems to be solved (evaluative) - Strong people dominate - Conflict avoidance - Agenda set by group - Relationship-building and task-oriented - Personal - Focuses attention on capacities to be strengthened and extended (appreciative) - Everyone participates - Honesty; naming 7_00.htm RELEVANT BEHAVIORS Being present and making facilitative use of self - Make facilitative use of self disclosures about your own thoughts, feelings and responses during the meeting. - Disclose how others have affected you. - Bring your own differences forward. - Disclose personal uncertainty.

What was it like? How did you deal with it? To whom, if anyone, did you speak about it, and how did they respond? What would have helped you deal with it even more effectively? - Imagine that one of your peers appears to you to be impaired in some way. What would you do? What would you say? What obstacles do you foresee? Where could you get help in figuring it out? What consequences might there be if you did nothing? ***module=39 page=0_5_Questions.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 0_6_Principles.htm Key Principles: - Effective physician work requires high levels of cognitive, relational and communication skills. All physicians experience times when their capacity to perform well professionally is subject to stress of some kind. - Professional functioning can be impaired for physical, emotional, spiritual and societal reasons. - Many kinds of impairments can be prevented, and many others effectively treated. - We have ethical and legal mandates to intervene with possibly impaired colleagues. On the other hand, we must overcome personal and societal obstacles to intervening. - Intervention begins with recognition of impairment. - Communicating effectively with possibly impaired colleagues requires an attitude of respect, courage to initiate conversation, and empathic communication and relational skills. ***module=39 page=0_6_Principles.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 0_7_Goals.htm Learning goals: At the conclusion of this module, you will be able to: - Describe the diverse ways in which a high level of professional performance can be impaired. - List what the stressors were, how you coped, how your practice was affected, and how any colleagues noticed or communicated with you, at a time or times when you had difficulty performing well as a physician or student - Describe strategies to prevent or minimize impairment in yourself and other physicians. - List reasons why you should take some action about impaired colleagues (rather than remain silent). - Describe and demonstrate skills for effective communicate with colleagues who are distressed or impaired in some way. ***module=39 page=0_7_Goals.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 1_00.htm INTRODUCTION The World Health Organization (1948) defines \"health\" as \"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity\". Our work requires high levels of cognitive ability, emotional balance, unimpaired consciousness, flexibility and competence with communication skills, and a physiological state that is stable and suited to the individual's practice. All physicians experience times when their capacity in one or more of these domains may be diminished, by stressors such as illness, family or social problems, and dysfunctional work environments. ***module=39 page=1_00.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 2_00.htm PHYSICIANS ADAPTATION TO STRESS MAY BE DYSFUNCTIONAL Physician rates of impairment from substance abuse and psychiatric and physical disability are at least as high as the general population. Physicians must meet the challenges of adapting to the many stresses intrinsic to the practice of medicine. Paradoxically, our training may promote maladaptive responses. As physicians, we experience times when our professional functioning is impacted by stress (1). These include such things as periodic sleep deprivation, the arrival of a new child, the death of a parent, the emergence of a personal health problem, or legal, economic or practice difficulties. The list is seemingly endless, and has much in common with people of most other occupations. Among physicians, there is at least a 16% lifetime incidence of major depressive disorders. Estimates of physician alcohol dependence range between 8% and 15%, compared with 13.5% in the US adult US population (2). Although there are scant data on physical illness among physicians, it is estimated that 10% of physicians will experience disabling physical illness at some time in their careers (3). Despite these challenges, physicians often adapt. From early childhood, we learn techniques to adapt to and attempt to overcome disappointments, illness, impairments, and pain of all kinds. Depending on the specialty and practice characteristics, the diligent and careful clinician can compensate for such difficulties as sensory disturbances (deafness etc), diabetes, well-controlled bipolar disorder, cancer and orthopedic impairments. In medical school and residency, the \"hidden curriculum\" reinforces coping silently with sleep deprivation, the unusually demanding specialty rotation or the inappropriate senior attending. In response to such stresses, you may have learned strategies that in hindsight seem maladaptive or even unprofessional. Consider the universal acceptance of the distancing tactic of calling undesirable or demanding patients by sarcastic or demeaning names. The very strengths that assure success in medicine, such as diligence, high degrees of responsibility and compulsivity, may also predispose physicians to much of the internal stress they experience, particularly as individual control over the physician's workplace are relinquished to group practices and corporate management. ***module=39 page=2_00.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 3_00.htm THE GAMUT OF IMPAIRMENTS Myriad psychiatric, physical, cognitive and more complex situations impair high level professional functioning. The list is limited only by our experience and imagination (4). Communication skills can be impaired by everything from cerumen impaction to keratitis to dysphasia or intoxication. Consciousness is commonly affected by medications, intoxication of all kinds, sleep deprivation, or acute illness. Physical functioning varies with the specialty: a fractured wrist would be a significant impairment in a surgical specialty, awkward in pediatrics, and possibly a mere nuisance in psychiatry. Cognitive performance is affected by everything from licit and illicit drugs and alcohol, insufficient sleep, neurological diseases and psychiatric disorders. Tight control of diabetes sometimes leads to harmful hypoglycemia. Fluctuations in mood and even \"normal aging\" may impair cognition (5). A patient of mine, a surgeon, went to the operating room despite knowing that he had a clinical condition with high probability of having deep venous thrombosis and a subsequent pulmonary embolism. Both the preoccupation with his illness and the resultant hypoxemia could have been significant. He and the patient were lucky, and there was no adverse outcome. After hospital admission for pulmonary embolism, he acknowledged his \"bad judgment\" in operating that day. What stresses do you think might have contributed to his lapse in judgment? ***module=39 page=3_00.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 3_10.htm Many impairments are preventable or manageable Fatigue in residency training is an example of impairment that is being prevented through regulation. Early identification and treatment is effective for most types of impairment. The sleep deprivation tacitly required by medical training and practice is under intense scrutiny and increasingly regulated by various professional and public agencies because of its documented impact on professional function and lapses in patient safety (6,7). At the level of the ward team we are required to notice our exhausted colleagues, insist that they rest, and finish their work for them. Physical ailments are often overcome with occupational therapy or special devices. Some impairments like depression may be more difficult to identify but are effectively managed when diagnosis is made. Regular health maintenance and screening for stresses and impairments through a steady relationship with a primary care physician facilitates diagnosis and management of these types of disorders. Check out the video example about resident colleagues providing validation and support for each other, through their common experiences of long and frequent call nights. Video exercise: View this video and reflect upon your own similar experiences. How do (or did) you manage similar difficulties for yourself and others? What are the important personal and systems issues? ***module=39 page=3_10.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 4_00.htm IMPERATIVES TO INTERVENE Because physician impairment risks injury to patients, we must intervene whenever we are concerned that a colleague might be impaired in some way. The ACP Ethics Manual (8) states clearly that \"physicians who are impaired for any reason must refrain from assuming patient responsibilities that they may not be able to discharge safely and effectively and there is a clear ethical responsibility to report a physician who seems to be impaired to an appropriate authority.\" Statutes vary from state to state, but some states require you, if you observe an impaired colleague, to report the colleague to state authorities, and there may be penalties for neglecting to do so (9). ***module=39 page=4_00.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 4_10.htm Impediments to intervention Ethical, regulatory, statutory and patient safety imperatives demand that we intervene. But the communication difficulties and issues such as power, shame and betrayal challenge us, and impede both good intentions and the imperatives that call us to action. You are likely to encounter numerous personal, societal and professional obstacles when considering intervention or attempting to intervene with colleagues (10). Conflicting loyalties/ betrayal: Sometimes you may be unclear to whom you owe your loyalty. Your actions could seem an act of personal betrayal even in the face of your obligations to the patient, your program, or your practice. For example, suppose you are confronting or reporting an impaired colleague such as a fellow student or resident. Perhaps you have suspicions about a practice partner with whom you are quite close and share family events and other social times. Boundary issues: Confronting colleagues, especially colleagues who are friends or lifelong practice partners, about personal issues seems invasive, feeling like a violation of personal boundaries. Unequal power: There are many examples of hierarchy in medicine, such as student/resident/attending, young/old, male/female, generalist/sub-specialist, and staff/chief. Even the idea of confronting colleagues in positions of power or authority about any difference of opinion, much less about issues of physician impairment intimidates most of us. If you are a student, you may feel in particular jeopardy since you are often in the most junior position (11). Fear of reprisal, perceptions of lack of respect, or painful past experiences frequently impede students. Lack of skill and experience: Techniques for communicating with the impaired colleague are rarely a part of medical training. Some senior management courses do include specific training. Since we often avoid, miss or are even excluded from these discussions, few of us have either experience or a specific idea of how to proceed. This makes it even harder when confronted by an emergent situation. Perfection and medical culture: The idea that the physician should be close to perfect has long fostered collective denial within the culture of medicine, as well as society at large. We can't be impaired, we've jumped Olympian hurdles. As one senior resident put it, \"I have slaved and struggled to get here, and I don't make mistakes!\" Shame and guilt: Aaron Lazare (12) has written about the role of shame and guilt in medicine. Physicians share many cultural beliefs of the general population, notably the idea that impairment suggests weakness; therefore, the inability to perform well for any reason is embarrassing and shameful. As the observing physician, you may recognize the risk of shame and, perhaps identifying with your colleague, become reluctant to discuss your concerns with him. When confronted, impaired physicians often react defensively against the possibility of their own frailty. Check out the video example about recognizing impairment from fatigue and effectively assisting the colleague. Video exercise: As you watch the video, listen for the obstacles the resident tells her friend about. Imagine what other obstacles there might be for you. How would you suggest she deal with them? ***module=39 page=4_10.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 5_00.htm RECOGNIZE EARLY CLUES For most impairments, diminished quality of work is a relatively late manifestation. We must attend to early behavioral cues and clues that a colleague might be impaired so that we can intervene as early as possible. Early behavioral clues that may be evident to an observant colleague include a decline in work habits such as tardiness, missing rounds, absenteeism or failure to complete tasks (13). Occasional lapses into irritability, mood disturbances, social isolation, or inappropriate behavior such as abusive language usually precede full-blown impairments. Eventually, the quality of work may diminish and be recognized by missed diagnoses, multiple patient or collegial complaints, inappropriate prescribing or other questionable care. Obvious signs of cognitive or motor impairment, such as might occur with a neurological disorder or severe arthritis, or signs of intoxication, should be acted on without delay. ***module=39 page=5_00.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 5_10.htm Explore your attitudes and know your values Because intervention is difficult, taking the time to explore and clarify your personal values and attitudes will enhance your effectiveness and reinforce your courage. A conversation with your possibly impaired colleague will be more helpful and effective if you have examined your attitudes and inner conflicts about loyalty, shame, perfection and so on. You can be helpful to your impaired colleagues if you have a sense of respect and a commitment to the overlapping communities in which you participate, such as the individual patients, the larger society, the profession, and the colleague. Skillful communication proceeds from attitudes of empathy, a non-judgmental approach and the courage to speak up, bolstered by a commitment to respond non-defensively if the colleague reacts badly. Respect for your colleague means that you trust that his or her concern for patients overrides personal concerns, even when observations suggest otherwise. You respect the effort that medical care demands of its physicians, such as your colleague, and other health professionals. Our commitment to society and patient safety overrides our relationships with individual physicians. However, we can forget that commitment in the face of a close collegial relationship, or ignore it as we imagine addressing the thorny issues of impairment with a colleague. Discussion with supportive colleagues, administration or other professionals helps us find the great courage to approach a peer, and even a respected senior physician, whether the situation is fairly clear (slurred speech and alcohol on the breath) or suspected (declining quality of work). A fully mindful attitude (module 2) that allows us to be of maximum help to a possibly impaired colleague combines respect, acknowledgement of the importance of both our collegial relationship and our shared responsibility to our patients, and concern for the colleague's well-being. ***module=39 page=5_10.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 5_20.htm Before a conversation with a colleague Take time in advance of opening a dialog to decide how and when to intervene, and consider what specific skills might facilitate the conversation. In general, proceed with discussion and intervention as soon as possible following arousal of your concerns, worries or suspicions. In medical settings, the primary risk of delay is harm to patients. First, set aside sufficient time. If impairment from drugs or alcohol is likely, the morning may provide a better time for intervention, before substance use for the day begins. Select a private setting for a face-to-face conversation. Communication skills for this conversation are similar to other difficult \"bad news\" interactions. Review the modules on building relationship (module 6), responding to strong emotions (module 13), delivering bad news (module 33) or the corresponding section on bad news in the module on discussing unexpected outcomes and errors (module 35). The strength of the \"evidence\" for impairment influences your approach. With behavioral cues or clues, but no obvious failures in patient care or repeated lapses in teamwork, a face to face conversation is warranted and provides opportunity to express your concerns and offer support. Prepare to respond to denial, guilt or anger. You may be tempted to \"drop\" the issue. Consider your responsibility to the patient and profession in the face of your ambivalence concerning reporting the colleague. When evidence of error, poor care, or repeated problems in teamwork exist, involve someone in a position of authority, regardless of whether you choose to discuss the situation in person with your colleague. Check out the video example about strategic planning for intervention when an observation of possible impairment involves a senior colleague. Video exercise: If you suspect a colleague of impairment, how might you seek a trusted colleague for help in planning effective intervention? Whom would you call? How might they respond? ***module=39 page=5_20.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 6_00.htm TECHNIQUES, SKILLS AND WORDS FOR COMMON SITUATIONS Most physicians have few occasions for conversations with potentially impaired colleagues. Think about what you wish to emphasize and how to \"deliver the bad news.\" Preparation allows the opportunity for practicing what you might say. Although you will find your own words, here are some examples of possible words that others use to initiate a conversation in some differing situations: Concern for impairment with someone you know well, and with only cues or: \"Bill, I need to talk with you about a concern of mine.\" (a warning) \"We've been working together for a long time and I've always admired your work.\" (statement of respect) \"Lately, however, I've been noticing (behavioral description of your observations)\" \"I'm worried.\" (statement of concern) \"Can you tell me what's going on?\" (a request) Concern for impairment with minimal evidence and with someone you know less well: \"Dr. Jones, I know we have not worked together much .(acknowledgment of relationship) \"I need to talk with you about something concerning to me.\" (a warning) \"It is rather awkward because we do not know each other well.\" (acknowledgment of difficulty) \"When I consulted on your patient yesterday I noticed \" (behavioral description of your observations) \"I was concerned about .\" (statement of concern) \"Can you tell me what is going on?\" (a request) Concern for impairment with minimal evidence and with a senior colleague: \"Dr. Thompson, I know you're the senior (use title) .and I am just a junior staff member \" (acknowledgment of relationship) \"I am really feeling stuck. Can I speak with you?\" (acknowledgment of difficulty) \"On the one hand, you are my supervisor. On the other hand, I am also responsible for my patients.\" (acknowledgment of your personal position) \"I am worried about what is going on tonight.\" (statement of concern) \"I am sure I smelled alcohol on your breath\" (behavioral description of your observations) \"I am worried about your going into surgery.\" (statement of concern) Check out the video example about a resident confronting the attending regarding possible impairment. Video exercise: If you have been in a similar situation, how did it go for you? How might you have handled the situation differently? Concern for impairment with evidence and requiring report to person in authority: \"Dr. Y, I am afraid I cannot handle this on my own, and I am also responsible for my observations. I need to speak with the Chair about this situation. I hope you can understand.\" Speaking to the person in authority: \"Dr. X, I don't know what to do. I have been working with Dr. Y, and I have noticed ..He and I have spoken already and he knows I am coming to you. I need to put this in your hands.\" Page: 8_00.htm INTERACTION WITH COLLEAGUES IN TREATMENT When your colleague returns from treatment, do not ignore your relationship. Initial interactions will likely feel awkward, but \"be yourself\" in the relationship, expressing interest and showing respect for complex feelings related to reentry to work situations. People with significant impairments often require absences from work to participate in treatment. Talking with someone who returns from hospitalization for cholecystectomy may be easier than if the illness is prostate cancer or breast cancer, with the very personal sexual and gender issues and the uncertainties attendant to cancer treatment. Even more problematic are diagnoses such as depression, substance abuse, or neurological problems like stroke or multiple sclerosis. How do you communicate in a genuine way, without being intrusive or asking too many questions on the one hand, or superficial and ignoring plain realities on the other? Although the specific circumstances and the individuals' own style and needs are paramount, some general principles apply. Be welcoming, in a manner consistent with your own and your colleague's emotional \"styles\". Express interest in the person's health and inquire about their feelings regarding reentry to the work force. Engage the person in clinical dialogue (consultation, case discussion, etc) as soon as appropriate: it is the foundation of our collegial relationships, and will reinforce this in both of your minds. If your colleague wishes to speak about his experiences, listen carefully, respond honestly and empathically. ***module=39 page=8_00.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 9_10.htm CONCLUSION Impairment in physicians takes many forms, from physical to psychological or behavioral. Many impairments can be either prevented, or effectively managed when recognized early and treated appropriately. When not dealt with properly, both patient and physician may be in danger. Physicians have an ethical as well as collegial obligation to intercede when they suspect a colleague might be impaired. Numerous communication obstacles retard and limit our intention to enter dialog with impaired colleagues, from the \"culture of medicine\" and role ambiguity to power differences. Begin by exploring, nourishing and sustaining attitudes of professional respect and commitment to the well-being of the physician and that person's patients. Learn and rehearse if necessary, strategies and skills for initiating conversation with your colleague, making explicit statements of respect and concern and using accurate behavioral descriptions. Acknowledge your personal concern, observations and feelings, and seek timely consultation with trusted teammates such as senior physicians, department heads and members of the administration, particularly when there appears to be danger to patients or your colleague. ***module=39 page=9_10.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 9_20.htm BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST - initiate conversation even if cues and clues leave room for doubt about impairment - speak respectfully and non-judgmentally - acknowledge the relationship - provide a warning - acknowledge the difficulty of broaching this issue - state your personal position - express personal concern - describe your observations using behavioral terms - seek assistance if harm appears imminent for a patient or your colleague - welcome colleagues returning from treatment with honesty and respect ***module=39 page=9_20.htm*** Module: 39 | Page: 9_30.htm REFERENCES - Riley GJ.

You can help to create a culture in which feedback signals are expected, valued and easily heard above the incessant background noise of clinic, classroom and hospital. A large body of medical education literature attests to the importance of giving effective feedback. (1) Ende, in a seminal article on giving feedback in the clinical setting (2), emphasized that feedback should address changing behavior rather than changing the person exhibiting the behavior. Learners at all levels desire and appreciate feedback. (3, 4, 5 ) For purposes of this module, \"feedback\" is a strategy employed by teachers and coaches to enhance the learning of their students or trainees. Feedback is directed towards improvement. On the other hand, \"positive reinforcement\" is acknowledgement of behaviors that are at least satisfactory. Key elements of effective feedback include a focus on future performance, good intentions, accuracy, and timeliness. In an often hectic environment, you can give better feedback and become more alert to feedback you receive if you attend carefully to maximizing how feedback is heard (the signal) and minimizing background (noise). Creating a learning environment in which constructive feedback promotes learners' willingness to try different approaches to problem-solving, knowing that you will note errors and give advice for improvement. This module will focus on general feedback principles, optimizing learning environments and emotions about feedback. ***module=40 page=01_0.htm*** Module: 40 | Page: 02_0.htm GIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT OBSERVED BEHAVIORS Effective feedback focuses on improvement and addresses behaviors that ought to be changed. Optimally, the feedback derives from personal observation of behaviors and skills. Focus on future performance: Feedback is directed towards improvement. It involves formative assessment of a specific behavior and a plan that, if implemented by the learner, will result in a favorable outcome. Giving feedback effectively involves judgment and skill. Failure to give feedback conveys a number of possible messages, ranging from, \"No improvement is necessary,\" to lack of instructor interest, or even instructor inability to provide feedback. Observations, even-handedness: Feedback is most effective when it is based both on personal observation (insuring accuracy of assessment that prompted the feedback) and its relevance to the learner's goals. Learners are particularly appreciative of instructors and peers who are even-handed, i.e. giving feedback when improvement is needed and acknowledging (positive reinforcement) actions done well. Commonly, you give feedback verbally or in writing, but you also convey feedback by non-verbal cues such as posture and facial expressions. ***module=40 page=02_0.htm*** Module: 40 | Page: 03_0.htm ESTABLISH EXPECTATIONS Clarify and agree on expectations so that learners know what they are to achieve, and give feedback in a timely way. Establish consensus as to mutual expectations: In an optimal learning environment you, as the instructor, will describe the behavior that you expect from learners and let them know that you will provide both formal and informal feedback. If you expect learners to demonstrate or master specific skills or tasks, outline them in detail, using handouts and skills checklists with anchoring statements, so that learners will know what they must achieve. Then, check that they understand your expectations. Formal feedback is accomplished in scheduled sessions and meetings, so that learners can reflect on the feedback and act upon it before you make a final (summative) evaluation. Informal feedback, occasionally not thought of by learners as \"feedback\"(7) can occur anytime. Encourage learners to reflect on the feedback so that they can internalize it, process it, and make it part of their total learning experience. (8) Please click the video-button on the left and watch the vignette \"You must fix this - NOW!\" Timeliness: Feedback is best given as near as possible to the observations you make. Otherwise, both learner and instructor lose some relevant details, and learners are likely to be distracted by intervening events, thus greatly reducing the value of the feedback. ***module=40 page=03_0.htm*** Module: 40 | Page: 04_0.htm ADJUST FEEDBACK STRATEGIES Learners appreciate feedback given straightforwardly, succinctly and objectively. Nuance your feedback by checking its impact, and consider learners' vulnerability about communication skills behaviors. Adjust to situation and learner: Calibrate and deliver feedback with proper attention to the learning situation. In general, non-emergent issues should be dealt with in non-emergent terms. In most situations, feedback requires no drama, since you are focusing on behaviors, not the person. Some learners need more information from their instructors and peers than others. Check with learners to establish the impact of feedback, and do not deliver more than they can digest. Some learners are easily overwhelmed, particularly if the feedback concerns a behavior that they already have been working to change, unsuccessfully. Keep your feedback free of personal references and deliver it in unemotional and objective terms. The art of giving feedback involves recognition that there are many ways of delivering feedback and the skillful instructor chooses the way most appropriate for the learner and for the occasion. Feedback about communication skills: Receiving feedback about communication skills often puts learners in a more vulnerable state than in other learning situations. They've been communicating all their lives. Even well-intentioned and well-constructed feedback delivered compassionately may be taken to mean \"you are not good enough\", or \"you should know better.\" In this latter situation, learners often feel personally attacked, criticized or ashamed that they cannot do a \"perfect\" interview or demonstration the first time. You can emphasize that you don't expect perfection and that getting feedback hastens the process of mastering skills and strategies for use in unfamiliar, unanticipated and unsettling situations every physician encounters while caring for patients and their families. ***module=40 page=04_0.htm*** Module: 40 | Page: 05_0.htm OPTIMIZE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS Learners expect feedback and value faculty and peers who offer appreciation of things well done as well as suggestions for improvement. Establish culture of feedback: In a study that examined the characteristics of faculty judged by learners as skilled in giving feedback (6), the authors found that these skills included a willingness to consider the emotional response of learners, an ability to resolve conflict, an interest in determining what the learner wanted to get out of the experience, a willingness to establish consensus as to mutual expectations, and a willingness to allow learners the time needed for them to solve the problem on their own. Make feedback part of the learning culture. In this instance, all students expect suggestions for improvement as well as acknowledgement of what was done well. In the latter instance, for example, comments from supervisors commending a student's performance need not be effusive. Often, a \"well done\", or a smile of approbation is all that it takes to make a learner's day. Self-assessment: When giving feedback, a useful strategy is to ask learners to self-assess, and to inquire about what they think is an appropriate next step on the road to improvement. This helps you determine their level of insight about their ability and their comprehension of reasonable next steps. After learners' self-assessment, you can offer your own assessment and recommendations for future improvement. ***module=40 page=05_0.htm*** Module: 40 | Page: 06_0.htm CONSIDER EMOTIONAL RESPONSES Expect that you and your learners will sometimes be feeling embarrassed or inadequate, shy, overconfident, irritated, disinterested or unmotivated. Singly, in groups and with peers, include talk about feelings when such conversation will advance learning. Discuss with learners that your feedback is meant to be helpful, formative, and designed to produce a positive summative evaluation. Remind them that they are adequate as persons and as learners, but that developing a toolbox of effective skills is a challenging task that will continue throughout their professional careers. Practice is important to skill development, and some skills are inherently more complex or difficult and will require more practice than others. Inevitably some learners take feedback personally, often feeling invalidated, or that they are not good enough. These feelings usually reflect the learner's broader issues and feelings about themselves in relation to the course work or clerkship. It is an opportunity for you to respond with empathy, and perhaps to inquire in a nonjudgmental fashion about what might be going on, and what is getting in the way of learning. ***module=40 page=06_0.htm*** Module: 40 | Page: 06_1.htm Feedback in Groups Self-esteem may be even more fragile in group settings. Do not make irrelevant positive comments to soften feedback. Another challenge involves giving feedback to a learner in the presence of peers in such a way that you preserve the self-esteem of the feedback recipient. As learners in the group notice that you attend thoughtfully to preserving the self-esteem of the feedback-recipient, the entire group is reassured that whoever is next will not be embarrassed or worse when they are the recipients of feedback. Trying to soften the impact of feedback by prefacing it with irrelevant positive comments is of little value. Learners quickly begin flinching as soon as they hear a positive comment because they fear that the next comment will be about something they have done especially poorly. ***module=40 page=06_1.htm*** Module: 40 | Page: 06_2.htm Feelings in those who give feedback Noticing and reflecting on the feelings associated with giving feedback improves teaching and learning. A willingness to give feedback involves taking risks, whether you are designated a \"faculty\" person or you are a peer of the feedback recipient. These risks include being unpopular, becoming involved in a confrontation, making incorrect or incomplete observations, working under time pressure and sometimes failing to explicitly acknowledge excellent progress or appreciate major deficits. Giving constructive feedback when stressed or angry is difficult and the results uncertain. Unless there is an immediate need, feedback is best delayed until tempers have cooled. In some cases, it is advisable to deliver the feedback in writing rather than verbally. Document the facts and deliver your recommendation for improvement as dispassionately as possible. Sometimes it will be helpful for you to disclose and acknowledge with your learners your feelings about your emotional responses to the stresses of giving feedback. Reflecting on both facts and feelings about the feedback aspects of your teaching activity with faculty peers improves the quality of future feedback to learners. Page: 08_0.htm ASSESS FEEDBACK EFFECTIVENESS Develop strategies for discovering the overall effectiveness of your feedback activities. Perhaps one of the greatest challenges facing faculty is finding out whether the feedback received was helpful. One way is to ask the learner what he or she has taken away from the feedback, and what he or she will do differently, and when. Another direct way is by observing improvement or conversely, its lack, in the learner's behavior. Alternatively, learner surveys or focus group sessions may yield information concerning the issues discussed in this module. These include the manner and timing of the feedback, the appropriateness of the feedback and recommendations for improvement and whether the feedback is given in a professional manner, i.e. free of bias, objective, positive and future-oriented. ***module=40 page=08_0.htm*** Module: 40 | Page: 09_0.htm CONCLUSION Providing feedback is both a skill and an art. It involves accurate assessment of an action or behavior that needs improvement and feedback that includes a plan which, if followed, will facilitate the learner's ability to achieve the desired goal. At the same time, learners receive and process feedback in different ways. The art of giving feedback involves knowing when and how to employ the most effective strategy to address the needs of individual learners. ***module=40 page=09_0.htm*** Module: 40 | Page: 10_0.htm BEHAVIOR CHECKLIST - Reach agreement that feedback facilitates improvement.

How do these experiences inform your sense of \"professionalism\"? - In a clinical situation, what principles might be useful in deciding how to respond to gifts you are offered from patients, or to a possible \"come-on\" from a patient, or to patients' questions about your personal life? - Have you encountered situations in which your professional boundaries became an issue? How did you decide what actions to take? - Personal issues play a role in physician's behaviors in regard to professional boundaries. How do the following issues apply to you? - To what degree do you take responsibility for the happiness and well-being of your patients? Of your family and friends? - To what degree are your interactions with patients meeting your own emotional needs? - How comfortable are you in saying \"no\" to patient requests? - Are you prone to \"rescue fantasies\" in your care of patients? - Do you often take care of the needs of others before your own? - What were the attitudes and behaviors about boundaries in your family of origin? ***module=41 page=0_5_Questions.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 0_6_Principles.htm Boundary-challenging interactions are those in which optimal professional action is unclear, often because the distinction between social and professional behavior is hazy. - Every physician is confronted with boundary-challenging situations such as gift-giving, self-disclosure, physical touching, social invitations or social encounters with patients. - Problem-solving requires physicians to reflect on the value of altruism, consider patient and physician motives, take into account inherent power differentials, seek consultation, and to err on the side of firm boundaries. - Communication about boundaries should convey respect for patients' feelings as well as acknowledge the complexity of the situation. Consider making statements about ethical and professional standards, statements that clarify the professional nature of clinical relationships and statements that indicate a need for additional time to consider the situation. ***module=41 page=0_6_Principles.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 0_7_Goals.htm Learning goals: At the conclusion of this module, you will be able to: - Describe 'boundary-challenging' situations that physicians commonly encounter. - In individual and group settings, reflect on appropriate boundary limits for physicians in general and yourself personally. - Describe strategies for deciding how to respond to commonly encountered boundary-challenging situations. - In boundary-challenging situations, demonstrate ability to compassionately appeal to professional standards, state a general principle to which you adhere, clarify the nature of the relationship, or postpone a decision. ***module=41 page=0_7_Goals.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 1_00.htm PROFESSIONALISM AND PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES The physician-patient relationship requires a special kind of intimacy. Caring and warmth must be shared within mutually understood professional boundaries, and 'boundary challenges' arise regularly in clinical practice. Awareness of these challenges and responses to them that are simultaneously human and professional require mindfulness and practice. The introduction section of this module is outlined as follows: - Intimacy and professionalism; concepts of boundaries and limits - Social and professional behavior norms; discernment and \"alarms\" - Responding to alarm signals; principles for examining and resolving challenges - Communicating: strategies for responding to boundary challenges - Communicating; skills for responding to boundary challenges ***module=41 page=1_00.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 2_00.htm INTIMACY AND PROFESSIONALISM Healing relationships involve trust, esteem, love and caring, which must be bounded by professional commitment to accountability, altruism, respect, confidentiality and self-care In this module, we explore the boundaries of a particular form of human relationship the doctor-patient relationship. This relationship is often an intimate one, in which trusting patients confide their most personal issues as well as their fears, hopes and dreams. Patients often esteem and love their physicians, and we in turn often admire, care for, and even love our patients. This intimacy and caring can be healing elements of our relationships with patients, but only when they occur within mutually understood professional boundaries. The idea of professional boundaries is informed by the concept of professionalism, which encompasses a commitment to altruism, confidentiality, accountability, excellence, respect, compassion, self-monitoring and self-care. The study of professional boundaries is concerned with behaviors at the limits of a clearly defined notion of professionalism. Any beginning medical student knows that it is unprofessional for a physician to come to work intoxicated, to have sexual relations with a patient, or to prescribe narcotics to a neighbor. You might also easily identify certain examples of professional behavior; such as, a physician who apologizes for and tries to rectify a mistake, or refuses to share patient information with her spouse. ***module=41 page=2_00.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 2_10.htm Where do you draw the boundary line? Physicians must recognize and resolve ambiguous, uncomfortable and potentially exploitative situations involving gift-giving, attraction, self-disclosure and social relationships. When we exclude situations that are clearly inside or outside of the bounded concept of professionalism, we notice that ambiguous boundary areas remain. Situations shaded in gray might include the following: - Is it ok to accept a gift from a patient? - Is it appropriate to reveal personal information to a patient? - What should I do if I know a patient from another context? - What if I find myself feeling attracted to a patient? - May I keep in touch with a patient who is no longer in my practice? Such situations are poised at the top of a \"slippery slope\" in which the patient or provider are at risk for sliding into an uncomfortable and potentially exploitative situation. Successful negotiation of these and related professional boundary challenges is essential for the development of a trusting and effective relationship between physician and patient, and ultimately a successful and satisfying career in medicine. ***module=41 page=2_10.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 3_00.htm SOCIAL AND PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR NORMS Understand the distinctions between the social norms that govern personal relationships and those that apply to professional relationships. Professional boundaries might also be thought of as the social norms that govern the physician-patient relationship. Ideally, social norms serve to maintain order, safety and productivity in human relationships and communities. Think of the social norms you learned growing up. You probably learned not to look at naked people, and certainly not to touch people's private parts unless you were involved in an intimate relationship. You learned not to play with or even discuss body fluids. You learned not to ask people very personal questions about themselves. These ingrained social norms no longer hold in the physician-patient relationship, as the new medical trainee breaks one \"taboo\" after another. This process can be unsettling and confusing to the medical trainee and even the advanced practitioner [. Students must learn to internalize a new set of social norms, called \"professional boundaries\". Furthermore, the physician must be clear on the distinctions between the behavioral norms that apply to one's personal or social relationships, and those that apply to one's professional relationships, and be able to manage the complexity inherent in \"dual-relationships.\"] ***module=41 page=3_00.htm*** Module: 41 no clear-cut \"rules of conduct\" for common boundary challenging situations. We offer guidelines and principles to help problem solve and negotiate boundary challenges. The development of healthy and effective professional boundaries is fostered by opportunities for mentorship, problem solving, and practice with language. Memorizing \"rules of conduct\" is rarely helpful in learning to negotiate common boundary challenges. This module states some general principles applicable to the infinite variety of challenges every physician encounters. The movies in this module depict commonly encountered situations containing a \"boundary dilemma\". They offer rich opportunities for reflection, case exploration, problem solving and role play. These clips depict physicians early in their training, but the lessons and principles are applicable for every level of medical training and experience. Apply the module's general principles and practice the suggested communication strategies and language, and begin building a repertoire of effective solutions that will work for you. ***module=41 page=3_10.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 3_20.htm Tune into your Boundary Alarm Certain situations, such as strong emotional reactions to a patient, gifts, or personal questions should trigger an internal \"alarm\" to warn you of a possible boundary challenge. In negotiating boundaries in clinical practice, you might find the \"boundary alarm\" framework a useful conceptual guide [. The phrase \"my boundary alarm is constantly going off!\" was coined by a medical student struggling with issues of self-disclosure and social interactions with patients. Like a home security system, a boundary alarm is intended to preserve safety, well-being and integrity. It must be set to ring at the correct threshold - a setting that is too low produces cold and distant relationships; too high a setting may result in unprofessional behavior and unsafe outcomes.] Your alarm should ring and increase your vigilance about boundary issues whenever you encounter personal questions, gifts, hugs, social invitations, chance encounters or business dealings with patients. Further, emotional reactions to patients, such as a strong like or dislike for a patient, or the feeling that you are saying or doing things around a particular patient that you wouldn't normally say or do are part of our normal human responses to other people, but in the professional setting should definitely set off your boundary alarm. Psychiatrists refer to these emotional responses as counter-transference feelings, acknowledge their power, and assure us that vigilance is especially important in these situations. Each movie in this module depicts a situation that should trigger your boundary alarm. Your thoughtful responses to the alarm signals are often as important to your patients' health as any other diagnostic or treatment actions you take on their behalf. ***module=41 page=3_20.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 4_00.htm RESPOND TO BOUNDARY ALARM SIGNALS: PRINCIPLES In this section, we present 6 problem solving principles that can help when you encounter a boundary challenging situation. Internalizing these principles can help you decide what to do and what to say when your boundary alarm rings - Operationalize altruism. - Understand patient motives and needs. - Understand your own motives and needs. - Remember the power differential. - Call on colleagues. - Err towards more boundaries, rather than fewer. ***module=41 page=4_00.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 4_10.htm Operationalize altruism Always consider what actions and words would best benefit the patient. Altruism is a fundamental distinguishing feature of a professional relationship. Operationalizing altruism involves discerning how to place the needs and interests of the patient before your personal needs. Take the time to ask yourself these questions: \"What action would be in the best interest of this patient?\" and, \"What action has the highest likelihood of assuring a successful ongoing professional relationship with this patient?\" Consider what course of action and what words would benefit the patient in the short-run and what might allow the relationship to thrive in the longer-term future. ***module=41 page=4_10.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 4_20.htm Understand patient motives and needs Discovery of effective resolution to a boundary dilemma requires an understanding of the patient's motive and purpose. For example, with gift-giving or social invitations, ask yourself: \"What does the gift or invitation mean to the patient?\" \"What is the patient trying to communicate with this gift?\" Let your answer help guide your solution. It is important to try to understand the meaning of the gesture, and to respond appropriately to it, if the relationship is to retain the proper focus on patient well-being. Usually the best way to understand a patient's motive is to ask the patient. You may have some hunches or assumptions about the meaning, but checking with the patient shows your respect for subtlety, your concern about trust and dignity, and your interest in putting your patient's well-being first. ***module=41 page=4_20.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 4_30.htm Understand your own motives and needs Discovery of effective resolution to a boundary dilemma depends on your attempt to understand your own emotions, needs and reactions. Try to identify what personal and professional issues a given \"boundary challenge\" raises for you. Pay attention to your own emotional reactions. Ask yourself: \"Am I identifying with a particular patient?\" \"Do I find myself disliking a particular patient?\" \"Are there potential conflicts of interest in my interactions with this particular patient?\" \"How does this make me feel regarding this patient and my medical practice?\" The physician should be especially aware of how his or her own needs such as the perfectly normal needs for certainty, affection, intimacy, or conflict avoidance may shift the focus of the encounter away from caring for a patient's illness or health concerns. Pause and consider whether certain possible responses actually serve your personal needs rather than advancing your professional relationship with this patient. ***module=41 page=4_30.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 4_40.htm Remember the power differential Power differentials are unavoidable. Ignoring these differences leaves patients and physicians vulnerable to unconscious attempts to take power or give it up. Take into account the power differential in your relationships with patients, and recall that this factor always affects expectations and interpersonal interactions. Whether consciously or not, patients perceive care providers as quite powerful. Medical trainees may not realize how patients perceive this issue or how strongly patients respond to it because of the trainee's relatively low status in the medical hierarchy. Seasoned clinicians often discount the extent to which the power differentials and the patient or physician's unconscious attempts to cope with them may lead down slippery slopes toward invitations, gift-giving and so on. ***module=41 page=4_40.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 4_50.htm Call on colleagues Gain important perspective and new ideas, and also assist your colleagues' growth by calling them into conversation and seeking advice. Bringing underlying issues and emotions to light and discovering sensible solutions is always easier when we enlist help from someone not directly involved or affected by the situation. Obtain supervision from a trusted colleague or call on a mentor for consultation when presented with a boundary challenge. Ask: \"Have you encountered experiences like mine?\" \"With the advantage of hindsight, what are your thoughts now about it?\" \"What if you were in my shoes, what would you think and do?\" Further, because boundary issues are so common and puzzling, your request is also likely to improve the colleague's awareness and understanding of future issues that he or she will confront. ***module=41 page=4_50.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 4_60.htm Err towards more boundaries, rather than fewer When uncertain, always take actions that you anticipate will provide safety and increase trust, even though you may feel more distance in the relationship than you'd like. Remember that relaxing a more rigid boundary is easier than back-pedaling up a slippery slope! Once a safe, trusting relationship is firmly established and boundary challenges clarified, you can always adjust the limits of the relationship. ***module=41 page=4_60.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 5_00.htm COMMUNICATION WHEN CHALLENGES ARISE: STRATEGIES When the boundary alarm rings, experienced clinicians have a repertoire of effective types of responses to call upon while they seek to better understood the nature of the issue. Use the following communication strategies when you encounter a boundary challenge: - Appeal to medical ethics or professional standards. - Appeal to general principles. - Reiterate the nature of the relationship. - Take the time you need to consider an issue. ***module=41 page=5_00.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 5_10.htm Appeal to medical ethics or professional standards Advise patients that you structure relationships in accordance with professional guidelines from groups to whom you are accountable. Patients are helped by hearing you speak about professional standards and guidelines for maintaining professional relationships. Let them see that you understand your clinical relationships to be professional ones, with boundaries that you will honor. \"I'm sorry, it's against the Board of Registration Guidelines for me to write a prescription for someone who is not my patient\" or, \"It's not considered a medically ethical practice to ____\" ***module=41 page=5_10.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 5_20.htm Appeal to general principles Let patients know that you'll relate to them according to the same norms and principles that you guide your interactions with all your other patients. Help your patient see that your actions about an issue are general principles by which you operate rather than special actions taken because the patient is special in some waythat is, \"It's not personal.\" You might say something like the following: \"I have a rule\" or, \"My practice/view/belief is ____, so this action (or these words) is what I do (or say) whenever this comes up with a patient.\" ***module=41 page=5_20.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 5_30.htm Reiterate the nature of the relationship Remind patients of your awareness that professional relationships have particular limits and structures. Remind patients of your awareness of the professional nature of your relationship. You could say: \"Sometimes it can be complicated for a caregiver to interact with a patient outside of the medical setting. In that situation, it might color my judgment about what's best for you medically, or could interfere with your willingness to disclose uncomfortable experiences \" or, \"As a medical student working with your primary care physician, I'll need to defer to her on that issue.\" ***module=41 page=5_30.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 5_40.htm Take the time you need to consider an issue Reassure patients that your relationship with them is important enough to require special consideration. The clearer you can be about your concern about keeping relationships properly oriented, the more cared for your patients will feel. Show how important a professional approach is by asking directly for time to reflect on the issue. Simple and direct statements are helpful. Consider saying the following: \"I'll need to think about that\" or, \"I'll consult my 41 | Page: 6_00.htm COMMUNICATION WHEN CHALLENGES ARISE: TACTICS AND SKILLS Each of the following text sections presents a specific common, predictable and recurrent dilemma, and is associated with a movie clip. In turn, go to each text section, view the film and reflect on possible answers to the questions. Think about what the physician or student should say or do in the particular scenario. The texts and movies present the following dilemmas: - [Self-Disclosure] Physician self-disclosure may contribute to establishing a healthy partnership with a patient, but always consider whether or not your personal disclosure will benefit the patient. - [Gift-Giving] Gifts may powerfully affect the giver and the receiver. Do not accept gifts unless examination of purpose and potential effect shows that their acceptance is in the best interest of the relationship. - [Social Invitations from Patients] Every professional interaction has a social component and satisfies normal needs for human connection. The decision to socialize with a patient requires that you first clarify the limits and nature of a 'dual relationship.' - [Physician-Patient Touch] Physician-initiated touch should be limited to sanctioned physical examination techniques and simple comforting gestures. ***module=41 page=6_00.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 6_10v.htm Physician self-disclosure Physician self-disclosure may contribute to establishing a healthy partnership with a patient, but always consider whether or not your personal disclosure will benefit the patient. Please click the video-button on the left and watch the vignette \"What about you, Doc?\" The vignette \"What about you, Doc?\" stimulates at least the following questions: - How did the physician end up in this situation? - What are some possible advantages and disadvantages of clinician self-disclosure in the doctor-patient relationship? - How would you respond? Please click the video-buttons below and watch 4 different ways how to respond: There are pros and cons to clinician self-disclosure to patients . Possible advantages of self-disclosure include establishment of rapport and building of a relationship, minimizing the inherent power-differential in the doctor-patient relationship, or expressing empathy by letting a patient know you have been in similar circumstances. Self-disclosure is problematic if it is automatic, gratuitous or done in an attempt (however unconscious) to seek care or sympathy from the patient. Also, a patient may perceive disclosure of personal information as an offering of friendship or mutual interpersonal intimacy which the clinician does not intend. Self-disclosure does risk heading down a \"slippery slope\" from which backpedaling is difficult. A certain amount of self-disclosure may in fact be rapport-building, and some evidence suggests that physician self-disclosure around personal behavior can motivate patients to adopt better health habits, specifically diet and exercise . Writers disagree on the appropriate depth and content of physician self-disclosure. Beach notes the complexity of self-disclosure communication, and declares that a mindful awareness should balance spontaneity. Always make a considered choice before deciding to disclose personal information to patients. The clinician's goal should be to maintain the focus of the interview on the patient and his or her wellbeing. If a patient asks you a personal question, consider why this particular question has arisen at this particular point in time. Is it an attempt to \"make friends,\" simple curiosity or an attempt to seek reassurance? Sometimes patients are interested in how your particular experience might relate to their own issues. For example, patients who have problems with their teens may ask if you have had teenage children. Your own similar experiences might in fact help you to understand and empathize with their situation, but you must still weigh the potential impact of such a revelation on the physician-patient relationship. If you notice that you are spontaneously talking about yourself to a patient, you should similarly explore your own motivations. Are you bored? Might this be an attempt to get the patient to like, admire or to take care of you? The guiding principle in deciding whether to self-disclose is altruism. To put altruism to the test, ask yourself: \"Is self-disclosure in this patient's best interest? Will disclosure strengthen the professional relationship?\" Whether or not you disclose in response to a patient's question, your words should redirect the interview to the patient in a sensitive and empathic manner. Language such as \"I'm really interested in your experience with ____\" can refocus the interview and lower the likelihood that the patient will feel rejected in the conversation. ***module=41 page=6_10v.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 6_20v.htm Gift-giving Gifts may powerfully affect the giver and the receiver. Do not accept gifts unless examination of purpose and potential effect shows that their acceptance is in the best interest of the relationship. Please click the video-button on the left and watch the vignette \"Thank You!\" The vignette \"Thank You!\" stimulates at least the following questions: - What motivates the patient's daughter to give the gift? - What else might motivate a patient to give a gift? - What are the pros and cons of accepting a gift (in this case, and in general)? - What should the student do and say? Please click the video-button on the left and watch a discussion about these issues. Whenever you receive a gift from a patient, ask yourself: \"What does this gift mean to the patient?\" A small token of gratitude might be accepted with a simple \"thank you\". A presumed attempt to bribe or manipulate should be refused by the physician, yet one must still choose words and tone of voice that convey that the refusal is in the best interest of the doctor-patient relationship. The refusal of a small gift may seem petty, but at what point does a \"small gift\" cease to be small? What if the gift is somehow too intimate? Or what if it is cash? What about those patients in whose country of origin gift-giving is the only means to ensure quality care? The physician should consider how the gift might affect his or her ability to care for the patient in a fair and objective manner. Ask yourself: If I accept this gift, will I feel obligated to spend more time and effort on this patient than I would otherwise? When refusing a gift, express appreciation for the gesture of giving. Possible language could be the following: \"I appreciate your thoughtfulness, but I have a general rule not to accept gifts from patients. The best gift to me is to know that you're satisfied with the care I've provided.\" Or \"Wow, this is a beautiful vase, but I'm afraid I can't accept it. It's an ethical issue for me and I don't want my other patients to feel obligated to give me gifts.\" Or consider accepting a gift on behalf of a team: \"This fruit basket is beautiful; our office staff will be so appreciative.\" Or suggest a donation to a charity: \"I noticed you included $50 in your Christmas card to me, but really, the sentiments in the card were all I needed. I can't accept the money personally, but would be happy to donate it to ___ charity\" Please click the video-button on the left and watch Dr. Gaufberg commenting on these issues. The American College of Physicians (ACP) position paper, the Ethics Manual, states, \"A small gift to a physician as a token of appreciation is not ethically problematic.\" They note consideration should be given to the nature of the gift, the potential implications for the patient-physician relationship, and the patient's probable motivation and expectation. Individual institutions differ on their rules regarding accepting gifts from patients, but the most important rule of thumb is to consider how acceptance or refusal of the gift will ultimately affect the physician-patient relationship. As with all \"boundary challenges\", discussion with a mentor or supervisor helps clinicians achieve perspective and resolve issues in a satisfactory manner.. Spence suggests that physicians keep a record of all gifts offered or received, and discuss the issue openly with colleagues in order to promote transparency.(8) ***module=41 page=6_20v.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 6_30v.htm Social invitations from patients Every professional interaction has a social component and satisfies normal needs for human connection. The decision to socialize with a patient requires that you first clarify the limits and nature of a 'dual relationship.' Please click the video-button on the left and watch the \"The Dancer\" vignette. The \"dancer vignette\" stimulates at least the following questions: - Is it ever acceptable to accept a patient's social invitation, or extend one to a patient? - What are the pros and cons to socializing with patients outside of the medical setting? - What questions might this physician ask in deciding whether to attend the performance? - If the genders of clinician and patient were reversed, would this affect your response to the scenario? - What if the clinical setting were different (e.g. ER, Primary Care, Psychiatry)? - What if the physician were providing on-going care to the patient? - What should the physician do and say in this scenario? Please click the 5 video-buttons in this table and watch the different ways how this could develop: A decision whether to enter into a social relationship with a patient is complex and dependent on several variables. What are the norms about social interactions based on location (rural vs. urban) and setting (psychiatry vs. primary care vs. specialty fields)? Will the clinician be able to remain objective and to maintain patient confidentiality? Does the patient wish to initiate a friendship, or a romantic relationship, or does the patient hope for special treatment from the physician? What are your own feelings toward this patient-- a sexual or romantic interest should immediately trigger your \"boundary alarm!\" How might socializing with a patient affect other patients who may learn of the social interaction? Remember the inherent power differential and how that will inevitably have some effect on any personal relationship with a patient. Please click the video-button on the left and watch Dr. Gaufberg commenting on these issues. If you decide to socialize, acknowledge that you have both a personal and a medical relationship, in fact a 'dual-relationship'. The clinician should initiate a conversation that results in clear definition of the nature and limits of the relationship. For example: can the \"friend\" now call the clinician at home about medical issues? If there is any interest in an intimate relationship, the professional relationship must be terminated. ***module=41 page=6_30v.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 6_40v.htm Physician-patient touch Physician-initiated touch should be limited to sanctioned physical examination techniques and simple comforting gestures. Explain potentially misconstrued contact in advance, respond graciously to patient-initiated touch, and set clear limits whenever you are concerned about the meaning of a physical gesture. Please click the video-button on the left and watch the \"The Hug\" vignette. \"The Hug\" vignette leads to the following questions: - What motivates the patient to give the doctor a hug? - What should the physician do and say in this situation? Please click the video-button on the left and watch a comment by the physician.. Many factors determine how individuals feel about hugs and other forms of touch, as each of us is influenced by cultural, social and family norms. Medical training and role modeling further influence clinicians. Touch may be initiated by either the physician or the patient, who will differ in their understanding of the meaning of touch and their comfort level with various forms of touch. Additionally, physicians break a normative social taboo during physical exams, touching patients in intimate places. Touch is sanctioned in this particular relationship, but the physical exam always includes close attention to the patient's privacy and comfort, through use of drapes and chaperones. The physician must ascertain that patients are aware of the rationale for any physician-initiated touch. Preface any physical contact that might be misconstrued, such as a pelvic exam in the work-up of abdominal pain and fever in a sexually active woman, with an explanation of the rationale for the exam. Clinicians have other reasons to touch patients, such as providing comfort, communicating warmth or validation, or signaling dominance. The clinician must only initiate physical contact that is intended to meet a presumed therapeutic need of the patient. It is safer to refrain from demonstrative touch such as a hug, especially if you do not know the patient very well. To convey the same sentiment as a hug, choose words that express the feeling, or consider a gentle touch on the patient's hand or arm. It is normal to occasionally feel attracted to a patient. If you find yourself sexually attracted to a patient, you must not only avoid any physical demonstrations of affection, but also avoid being overly friendly in your words and manner. If your feelings of attraction continue in an ongoing relationship, discuss this with a colleague or mentor. Patients may initiate touch with clinicians for a variety of reasons, such as communicating warmth or appreciation, displaying relief, seeking approval, dependence, or a closer relationship with the physician, or transmitting sexual desire or interest. Consider the intent behind patient-initiated touch. If uncomfortable for any reason, you can set limits in a respectful manner. Possible approaches to limit setting include acknowledgment of the gesture of the hug, and an offer or modeling of a different means of expression. You might use body language to model preferred behavior (an outstretched hand for a handshake in anticipation of a hug). (9) Other strategies that help to set limits include the following: - Openly name the issue, and cite personal or cultural differences. \"You seem to be someone who expresses feelings with hugs. Our nurse manager is the same way. That's great -- but I'm more of a hearty- handshake type.\" Or, \"Wow, you really surprised me with that hug. In Asian culture, we pretty much limit our hugs to immediate family a handshake or a high-five would work better for me! I'm really happy that you're relieved that everything's ok.\" - Set a general rule or cite professional standards: \"I'm glad you're so pleased with the lab results, and I should let you know that I have a general rule not to hug my patients in today's social climate we physicians are discouraged from hugging.\" Accompany such statements with the offer of a handshake or a warm smile. ***module=41 page=6_40v.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 6_50v.htm Discussion about Boundary Issues Elizabeth Gauberg, M.D., MPH and Dennis Novack, M.D., are having a discussion about boundary issues ***module=41 page=6_50v.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 7_00.htm CONCLUSION Mutual caring between physician and patient only thrives within the mutually understood boundaries of a professional relationship. Physician-patient relationships are therapeutic in themselves. Mutual caring between physician and patient promotes and augments trust, safety, confidence and hope. This caring is an essential aspect of therapeutic and healing relationships, and it can only thrive within the mutually understood boundaries of a professional relationship. Occasionally, unexamined feelings or misinterpreted communications by patient or physician lead to incursions beyond those boundaries, and such incursions always threaten the relationship. Principles to address boundary issues include operationalizing altruism, seeking to understand the patient's and your own motives and needs, being vigilant about the power differential inherent in clinician-patient relationships, and consulting with colleagues or mentors when a problem arises. If unsure of the most effective response in a moment, it is safer to err or the side of firmer boundaries. ***module=41 page=7_00.htm*** Module: 41 | Page: 8_00.htm References - Harper G.
