So torn about vaccines Before all of you pro-vaccinating mamas tear my head off, save it cause I've already heard/am aware of anything you could say and a debate is not the point of this post so please try and control yourselves and refrain from saying anything rude, snide, confrontational, demeaning, etc cause I don't want to hear it and we're all trying to do our best for our babies with the conflicting information we're given. So with that said.. I'm just so torn on whether to give my son vaccines or not. He's almost 5 months and has only had Vit K and one dose of tdap. I've read some really eye opening, disturbing and scary articles and books written by doctors, scientists and other reputable sources on vaccines and there detrimental affects on babies and children and it terrifies me to inject anymore vaccines and all the crap they put into them, into my baby. And then on the contrary, part of me is fearful of \"what if I don't give him the vaccine?\" I just don't know what to do and again I don't want this to turn into a petty debate. I'm looking to hear from STMs or third, fourth, 5th etc who didn't vaccinate and what your experience was with your LOs. Did they get sick with any of the common diseases that vaccines are said to prevent? How are they thriving with learning? ADHD? Autism? Chronic colds? Etc [20+ Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=So+torn+about+vaccines) Facepalm! I would take a look at your \"reputable\" sources. I was scared, but being in graduate school, I had access to all the scholarly articles and research vice the regular internet and also ended up with an advisor who studied the anti-vaxx movement and I came to the conclusion that vaccines are important and generally safe. I still don't know if we will do the HPV though since it is easier to avoid sex than getting coughed on. By and large, it seems the only reputable studies (peer reviewed, etc) on potential overvaccination effects are in veterinary medicine and the yearly shots for everything dogs get. I strongly recommend you getting the HPV vaccine, as I have just had a family member die from cervical cancer (caused by HPV). The virus was most likely transmitted by her husband of 20 years and unfortunately not caught in time. The vaccine prevents a deadly cancer, but unfortunately was not available when she was young, and you can only get it until a certain age. Hello, I completely understand why you are reaching out for help. There is so much confusing with what has been communicated in the doctors office and other real evidence that says otherwise. WIth feeling concerned, i did not want to just not do vaccines. I felt like it would be irresponsible to not do anything. Please research homeoprophylaxis. There is proven immunization alternatives that are natural and non toxic, for every disease you would be getting vaccines for. Not to mention, if there were to be any illnesses, like the measles, there are natural remedies to cure this. Go with your gut feeling and follow the peace you have. [https://immunizationalternatives.com/about-kari-j-kindem-cfhom/](//immunizationalternatives.com/about-kari-j-kindem-cfhom/) I am pro-vaccinate, but wanted to offer a practical piece of advice. If you intend for your child to attend public school be sure to research your state's guidelines regarding vaccination. Only a few states offer an opt out due to personal belief. Unless you live in one of these states you would have to provide proof of vaccination or proof of religious exemption (If that applies/your state allows it) in order for your child to enroll in school. Hi! Thank you for posting Hi momma, great job looking out for your baby! I'm not here to change your mind, just to give you my experience. During my nursing school rotation in the pediatric unit I saw one infant die and one toddler die. There were several others that were admitted. All the local daycare schools required vaccines, but one home daycare did not. There was an outbreak and many of the children were hospitalized. I will never forget the wail of a mother who has just been told her child has died. The father was adamant against vaccinating and the mother was for vaccinations, but he had convinced her to avoid vaccines completely. It was very sad. She slapped him and was screaming and hitting him when she was told of her baby's passing. We had to call security. It was awful. I am required to provide post-mortem care in nursing school, but was allowed to forgo this experience because I was 3 months pregnant. I don't think I could have handled that. I've had 6 years of post-high school education and numerous biology, microbiology, and anatomy classes, as well as pharmacology classes. I will vaccinate my children and I do not believe vaccines cause autism. Reactions are rare, other than the typical fever that accompanies a \"jump start to the immune system\". If you choose not to vaccinate, PLEASE keep your children at home. They may get the measles and be fine, but they may end up on life support like the babies I saw. I wish I could erase that from my memory, but nursing sees a lot of death. Do your research and get information from CREDIBLE SCIENTIFIC SOURCES. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM \"MOM BLOGS\" AND CELEBRITY SITES FOR RELIABLE INFORMATION. I am a STM and my first son was/is vaccinated and I have to admit I was scared too. I read all the stuff on autism, ADHD, cancer, etc. but I ultimately did choose to vaccinate because at the end of the day I am not a doctor so my theories were based on stuff I read online from sources I wasn't certain were accurate. I've also seen the illnesses that no longer exist because people vaccinate, in my mom's generation things like polio existed but now thanks to vaccines, they don't or at least not in the ways they did before. It seems like people don't know what causes things like autism, one day it's low iron levels in expecting moms, the next it's low folic acid levels, I can't keep up and I would drive myself nuts trying! I happen to think it's coming from GMO's and pesticides, what we are eating versus vaccines which is a lot more scary to me! Autism rates are extremely high and I think it's more about our food supply then the mercury in the vaccines. These are just my thoughts... my first son did fine with the vaccines so I am less scared with my second but with each set of shots I am aware of his behavior and try to remind myself this is for his health. All you can do is trust that our doctors, at least the ones in my life are looking out for our wellbeing. Sadly not all can say that but I have chosen a great OB and a pediatrician that I love and who I know loves my children. Then I pray and give it up to God or else I'd go nuts!! Yes!!!!! Im so glad there are other people who actually research vaccines and not just go along with medical professionals who are there to \"help and do whats best\" for your kids. Unfortunately the links to the studies I mentioned in my previous comment could not be included due to being marked as \"spam\". Please feel free to e-mail me at kristen22992@gmail.com if you would like for me to send them to you. Im a 3rd time mom. I have not vaccinated any of my kids and they are truely more healthy than my nieces and nephew who are fully vaccinated. They are healthier than the other kids at their public school and daycare. My kids are not walking around full of diseases or poison that vaccines are full of. We chose not to vaccinate because of the ingredients in the vaccines themselves. Im not going to pay someone to pump my kids bodies full of poison. Drs are one sided because they have been indoctrinated to push vaccines and scare people into getting them. I know someone who's child had whooping cough as an infant and survived well by treating it naturally. He now has a lifetime immunity to it. No we dont think vaccines cause autism, however the amount of mercury and formaldehyde in the vaccines can cause it.....Do your research, read the ingrediant list and ask around. If youre torn, i wouldnt do it. I honestly believe sids is a vaccine reaction but drs wont admit it. You have to choose what you believe is best for YOUR child and YOUR family. Dont let drs or strangers scare you into something you are not comfortable with. No i dont believe in herd immunity. I believe if God wanted our bodies full of the junk in vaccines he would have put it there himself. Not to straw man you because I believe there is A LOT wrong with what you said, but that last line...WOW! Do you really believe that? I'm not religious, but I'm pretty sure most religions don't turn their backs on medicine. Are you saying (by that logic) that you won't allow your children any sort of medical treatment because of your religion?
