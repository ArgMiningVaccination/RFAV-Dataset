I came across an article in Talent Management magazine entitled \"When business declines, focus on alterations.\" The author, Harold D. Stolovitch, PhD, an emeritus professor at the Universit\u00e9 de Montreal, confessed he had learned many lessons over the years from drycleaners. People who work in dry cleaning labor in a hot, humid environment and are exposed to toxic chemicals. Youwould expect turnover to be high. One of Stolovitch'sdry cleaners, though, had 120 employees, most of whomhad worked for the company for many years. The secret of this employer's low turnover? The dry cleaner had learned (and \"lived\") several leadershipprinciples: \"Pay more and demand more;\" \"Show me a better way, and I'll do it and reward you for it;\" and \"Never put a ceiling on rewards. The more you do, the more you should get.\" You might also expect dry cleaners to experience a significant slowdown during a recession. Another of Stolovitch's dry-cleaner friends told him: \"True,my dry cleaning business is way down, because people wear their garmentslonger before bringing them in. But my alterations business is booming!\" The lesson: When one part of your business is slow, focus on another part.A third dry cleaner thrived despite major competition in his neighborhood. His gimmick was two-for-one cleaning, but the real reason he was successful,he said, was because of his philosophy: \"If I do a great job, plus give mycustomers more than they expect, we both come out winners.\" The lessons from these dry cleaners are certainly applicable to chiropractic practices. If you are a new practitioner, you can start off right by applying goodleadership principles from the day you open your doors. If you are an \"old\"practitioner, you can make subtle changes to give your practice a boost. I hope you'll enjoy the cover story in this issue. A number of readers looked back on the start of their careers and shared the good things they had done aswell as the mistakes they had made. Their reflections could help you \u2014 nomatter where you are in your career.

The New Jersey Supreme Court issued its decision in the case of Bedford v. Riello June 18, according to Sig Miller, DC, executive director of theAssociation of New Jersey Chiropractors (ANJC). The court, with two justices dissenting, held that the regulations concerning chiropractic scope of practice\"permit manipulation of articulations beyond those of thespine when there is a causal nexus between a condition ofthe manipulated structure and a condition of the spine.\" The court further held that, \"whether adjustment of a particular portion of the body is permissible as a 'relatedstructure' under the rule must be determined anddemonstrated by the practitioner on a case-by-case basis,focusing on whether a condition to the adjusted structurebears a causal relationship to a condition of the spine.\" \"This is a resounding victory for all chiropractors inNew Jersey as well as other states who have been closely monitoring this precedential case.,\" said Miller in an e-mail. \"The case was remanded for retrial on themalpractice issue, but the decision is effective June 18,2008, permitting chiropractors to adjust extraspinal areasprovided they document a causal nexus to a condition ofthe spine.\" Source: Association of New Jersey Chiropractors, www.anjc.infoDana Mackison, DC, representing Hygenic Corporation, presents a $25,000 to Kent Greenawalt, F4CPpresident.

In the case of Jose Facundo-Guerrero vs. Workers' Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB), Nurserymen'sExchange, et al, the court ruled the state had the legalauthority to place limits on chiropractic treatments.

A survey by the National Association for the Self- Employed (NASE) of nearly 4,000 micro-businesses (a follow-up to research conducted in 2005) showed thathigh cost continues to be the most significant barrier to offeringhealthinsuranceand that small businesses strongly feel they are at a disadvantagecompared to their larger counterparts when it comes toaccess to coverage. A separate study by the RAND Corp. found that the economic burden of providing health insurance for workersincreased more for small businesses than for large ones from2000 to 2005, although the spike did not cause a significantnumber of small employers to abandon the benefit. However, the smallest businesses (those with 25 or fewer employees) saw the expense of providing healthinsurance rise by nearly 30 percent during the studyperiod \u2014 significantly more than the hikes experiencedby medium and large businesses examined by the study.

A study released by the Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC) said the momentum for health andwellness initiatives has come from large employers lookingfor long-term strategies to address rising costs and tosupport their consumer-based strategy of giving employees more responsibility for healthcare decisions and costs. A Watson Wyatt survey of 453 large employers found that half currently use incentives to encourage their workers to participate in health improvement activities,such as smoking cessation or weight managementprograms. By 2009, however, that number is expected toleap to 74 percent.

It is exciting to begin your professional life, whether you open your own clinic immediately after graduation, as 45 percent of new graduates do1, or wait several years in order to gain experience as an associate, as 48 percent do. No matter when you decide to open your own clinic's doors, however, your venture into the \"real world\" isfraught with risks and unknowns. The U.S. Bureau ofLabor Statistics (BLS) reports that about 66 percent of allsmall businesses are still in existence after two years; afterfour years, that percentage drops to 44 percent. Businesses in health services and education, however, fair much better. After two years, 73 percent are stilloperating, and after four years, 55 percent still survive. 2 To help minimize the risk of opening your business and improve your chances for success, Chiropractic Economicsasked readers to reflect on their experiences as a newpractitioner. Here is what they told us: KICK-STARTING YOUR PRACTICE Getting off to a good start is critical. Respondents told us what they did to jump-start their practices: Had card, did travel. Like so many others, Anna Saylor of the Van Every Family Chiropractic Center (www.vaneverychiropractic.com), Royal Oak, Mich.,joined the local Chamber of Commerce. In addition, shewent door to door to all of the local businesses andhanded out her business card to introduce herself. Finally,she advertised a grand-opening event and opened herdoors with a celebration. Health lectures. Richard Coy , Coy Chiropractic (www.coychiro.com), Glen Carbon, Ill., made himselfavailable to give short lectures and classes on health-related topics. \"Invariably, 25 percent to 35 percent of theaudience would come in for an evaluation,\" he says,emphasizing that he did not charge for the lectures, nordid he try to sign up patients. All he did was giveparticipants his card with instructions to call the office foran appointment. Telemarketing. Wanting to get his name out to many in a short amount of time, Kyle McKamey of HealthZone Chiropractic in South Haven, Mich., decidedto jump-start his practice with telemarketing. He hired a company to do the telemarketing, which he notes is a legal activity in Michigan. He explains, \"Wegave them the appointment times, and they usuallydouble-booked. When I opened my practice in May 2005,we had over 15 new patients the first two weeks, and closeto 40 during the next month. \"Out of that number, we got approximately 50 percent under care, and about 50 percent of those patients are stillwith us. We had a lot of no-shows and a lot of peoplecome through the door that tried to get a free adjustment,but we stuck to our guns, and it all was worthwhile.\" Spinal screenings. Many DCs do spinal screenings, but Dennis Balch of Alliance Chiropractic (www.alliancechiro.com), Millbrae, Calif., did hisscreenings in a rather unique setting: He set up ascreening station at the entrance to a local hiking trail,where he also showed runners and walkers properstretching techniques. He then gave them brochures andbusiness cards. NEW-DC BLUNDERS Hindsight is keen. Respondents to our questionnaire looked back at the beginnings of their careers andconfessed to mistakes they had made. Being pushy. Julia Allerton of the Orr Chiropractic Center (www.orrchiropractic.com), Pataskalia, Ohio, is a12-year veteran who now realizes one of her early mistakeswas being too eager. She says, \"If I appeared desperate andmade too many recommendations \u2014 such as for pillows orsupplements \u2014 patients just ran the other way.\" Inadequate tax information. Paying the right amount of taxes is important, Coy learned. \"I didn'tcompletely understand the tax laws and got behind onemployee tax withholdings.\" Buying a building too soon. Although it sounds like a good idea to own your own practice, some newpractitioners have found that buying too soon can get youin over your head. \"I didn't really understand what itwould take to get everything in the building up to code,\"says Saylor. Spending too much on equipment. Setting up an office costs a lot, as a number of new practitioners foundout. Christopher Rylee of Health First Chiropractic & Wellness (www.allinonechiropractic.com), N. RichlandHills, Texas, said his startup costs escalated with high-costpurchases. Failing to join a practice-management group. Balch looks back and realizes his biggest mistake waswaiting three years before he joined a practice-management group. Once he started working with aCHEC11p23.ps 6/20/08 7:17 PM Page 2324 C HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .COM VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008COVER consultant, he learned to make treatment plans more efficiently,educate patients, and refine hispublic-speaking skills. Going out on her own too soon. \"Opening my own practice within six months of graduation\" wasthe mistake Liz Faletti (www.drlizdc.com), Kennewick,Wash., made. \"I thought I could do itbetter than the doctor I was workingfor, who had been practicing for 15years.\" Staying in a poor location. Karl S. Forgeron of Barrington Orthopedic Specialists(www.barringtonortho.com),Hoffman Estates, Ill., learned thatlocation is important, but inertiakept him from moving from a poorlocation. \"My landlord breached mylease agreement the first month Imoved in by not allowing me tohang signage I negotiated in mylease. I stayed, paid, and made it'work' for nine years too many.\" Too many contingency cases. Forgeron also laments taking on toomany personal-injury cases that werepaid on contingency. \"Half of mycases in the first two years of practicewere personal injury,\" he says.\"Sometimes it would be five yearsbefore I got paid, and then lawyerswanted me to accept half of my billas payment in full.\" Not reading the fine print. Contracts can be complicated, andit's important to read everythingcarefully. June Rogers, Rogers Chiropractic (www.scanmekc.com),Kansas City, Mo., says her biggestmistake was in signing contracts shedidn't understand. She explains, \"I signed a lease for office space and didn't understand Ihad an option to renew, which I hadto exercise before the lease was up. Ilet the expiration date slip by. WhenI was contacted to sign a new lease,it was too late to renew at theprevious rate. Not reading the fineprint cost me a price increase.\" LESSONS LEARNED Admitting mistakes is one thing; learning from them is another.Respondents shared their insightsinto what they would do differently ifthey were starting a practice today. Learn to speak. Because giving health talks is so critical todeveloping referrals, Allerton CONTINUED A survey Chiropractic Economics took in 2007 indicated that nearly half (44.6 percent) of new graduates immediately open their own practice, and 7.5 percent bought an existing practice. The rest decided to work for an experienced chiropractor for a while.CHEC11p24.ps 6/20/08 7:18 .COM VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008COVER recommends investing in developing public-speaking skills and gettinginvolved in community-serviceorganizations. Buy 'used.' McKamey realizes that failing to keep costs down was hisbiggest blunder, so he recommendsidentifying what you really need in theway of equipment and office facilities,and getting only that, includingbuying used x-ray equipment. Budget enough working capital for six months. It's easy to go overboard on spending, saysRylee. If he were starting out now, hewould put aside enough money forsix months of operation. He alsoadvises, \"Develop an emergency fundthat you pay into each month beforeyou pay out your overhead.\" Understand the clinic you are buying. \"If you are considering buying an existing practice, don't beafraid to walk away.

What about one thatspecializes in pediatriccare? Making yourpractice look the part iscritical for attracting yourtargeted patients. You can find many ways to model a family practice, but for a new practitioner, cost and ease ofimplementation are important as youlook at office design, patienteducation and communication, andprocedures. OFFICE DESIGN Creating a child-friendly environment in your office is verysimilar to creating a child-friendlyenvironment in a home. This mayseem second nature to the practitionerwho has children, but completelyforeign to someone without them. T wo things are critical \u2014 comfort and safety. Children are often fearful of new places, especially doctors' offices.Eliminate those groundless fears bycreating a unique experience forthem. Look at your office from a child's perspective. Start by understanding how your office looks to a child.Get down on your knees and look at the office from achild's perspective. It looks very different than it doesfrom an adult's point of view. Dedicate an area to children. Dedicating a specialarea to children tells the parents and children you care \u2014that you want to make the chiropractic experience specialfor them. The area can be as simple as a small indoor playhouse, which is inexpensive and takes up little space, or evenhaving a corner painted or wallpapered in child-friendlyGetting started in a pediatric practice By Sean Manning, DC CONTINUED CHEC11p35.ps 6/20/08 7:27 PM Page 3536 C HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .COM VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT colors or designs, and outfitted with child-sized tables, chairs, and toys. Put up drawings and posters at a child's eye level. Few things are more exciting for children or parents than to see their artwork on display in your office. Post pictures of your pediatric patients. With the parent's permission, take pictures of the children youadjust and post them in a place for other parents to see.The pictures remove the element of the unknown byshowing what an adjustment looks like and introduce theconcept of kids under chiropractic care in anonconfrontational way. Put up 'kid posters.' It also helps to display posters throughout the office that show children and/or conceptsrelated to children under chiropractic care. Do regular safety checks. Put safety on the high end of your child-preparedness list. Cover every exposedoutlet with an outlet protector. Also, secure lamps orother pieces of furniture that could fall or be pulled down. And keep an eye out for sharp corners; cover them with rubber bumpers to protect small children who may falland get hurt by them. Adjusting tables are also potential hazards. Small, curious hands can reach into the mechanical areas ofhigh-low and drop tables and get pinched. Get anelectrician to install a \"kill switch\" high on the wall thatyou turn off whenever you leave the room and turn ononly to use the table. When you begin working with a new child-patient, review safety concerns with the parents in front of thechild. EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION Once you have created a safe and welcoming environment, it is time to start seeing child-patients. Ask the right questions. Education starts with the first contact \u2014 the initial phone call. When someonecalls to make an appointment, train your CA to ask if theappointment is for her or her entire family. Even if the appointment is only for the adult, the question introduces the concept of pediatric chiropracticcare. For many people, even ones that have been underchiropractic care, this is a new idea. Give a tour. Once a parent comes into the office, give a tour and point out things you have done to makeyour office comfortable and safe for children. Take a patient history on childhood spinal trauma. The next opportunity to educate comes with the intake paperwork. Include questions about childhoodspinal trauma. CONTINUED CIRCLE .COM VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008PRACTICE MANAGEMENT Even when a parent says he doesn't remember any childhood traumas or he only had the \"normal\"kind, it is an opportunity for you topoint out that many of the adults yousee started to accumulate spinal stressas a child. Explain that in many cases, once parents understand how beneficialearly spinal care can be to a child'shealth, they want to have their ownchildren checked. This is why theywill notice so many parents bringingtheir children into your office for care. Provide monthly handouts. At least once a month have aneducational handout focused onchildren's health issues with achiropractic focus. Relate it tocurrent events if you can. Schedule events for children. Scheduling office events for childrenis another easy way to increase theawareness of what you do.PROCEDURES When you are ready to start treating children, show yourconfidence in working with them. Develop a relationship with the child. Gaining the confidence of children can take a long time,especially if they have haduncomfortable experiences at doctors'offices. Establishing trust is one of the most powerful things you will do inthe healing relationship with a child. Talk to the child. Obviously, the older they are, the more you canengage them. But even very youngchildren understand chiropractic ifyou make it simple enough. Look the child in the eye just as you would an adult. Get down to thechild's level. Speak softly, andexplain everything you are going todo before you do it. Then listen to the child. Work within the child's comfort level . Don't ever force anything. If you lose the child's trust,it can take a very long time to getback, if you get it back at all. These simple, inexpensive strategies to launch a pediatricpractice can be implementedimmediately. Review the informationwith your staff, and go through youroffice together. Role play with eachother until everyone is comfortablewith the new procedures, and thenget to work.

Yet, many DCs are very successful, which must mean that success is not entirely dependent upon salesmanship. Success, instead, is influenced by management ability,clinic systems, and population \u2014 as well as by thepractitioner's attitude. When all of these factors function at their fullest potential you can expect your practice to grow steadily. To grow your practice, however, you must first start by getting a baseline knowledge of where you are currently\u2014 both in your practice, as well as in your personalattitude. T wo tools can help you \u2014 a practice-assessmenttool and a practitioner-assessment tool. YOUR PRACTICE ASSESSMENT Evaluate how well your practice is functioning by rating each of these statements: [ ] DC factors: How good are your management abilities and the professional competence of your staff?Give yourself 1 - 3 if you struggle to be a good manager oryour staff lacks skills; 4 - 7 if you believe you and yourstaff have average abilities; or 8 - 10 if you believe yourmanagement abilities are above average. [ ] Clinic systems: If your office systems are inadequate, give them a rating of 1 - 3. If they are OKwith occasional stressful situations arising from them, givethem a rating of 4 - 7. If they are extraordinarily definedand propel you forward without stress, give them 8 - 10. [ ] Population: Look at the population from which you attract patients. If it is sparse or you have a great dealof competition from other chiropractors, physicaltherapists, and other healthcare providers, give populationfactors a rating of 1 - 3. If you feel population factors areaverage, give them a rating of 4 - 7. If you feeldemographics in your area are extraordinarily in yourfavor, give a rating of 8 - 10. More growth, income, profits, and personal fulfillment result from having higher ratings. Action steps: Your goal is sustainable success, so identifying what makes you strong is important.Identifying where you are weak takes courage, but isimportant if you are to implement change. Have meaningful discussions with your spouse, business partner, and staff on how this simple report card canimprove the next quarter's growth.

False claims are those that cheat or mislead the government with fraudulent claims filed undernumerous federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In 1863, Congress enacted a false claims and statements statute, entitled the False Claims Act, in the wake offraudulent suppliers working with the Union army. The False Claims Act is the single most important tool U.S. taxpayers have to recover billions of dollars stolenthrough fraud. Under the act, those who knowinglysubmit or cause another person or entity to submit falseclaims for payment of government funds are liable forthree times the government's damages, plus civil penaltiesof $5,500 to $11,000 per false claim. The act contains qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions that allow citizens with evidence of fraud againstgovernmental programs to sue, on behalf of thegovernment, in order to recover the stolen funds. In compensation for the risk and effort of filing a qui tam case, the citizen whistleblower or \"relator\" may beawarded a portion of the funds recovered, typicallybetween 15 percent and 25 percent. A qui tam suitinitially remains under seal for at least 60 days duringwhich the Department of Justice can investigate anddecide whether to join the action. FRAUDULENT ACTS It is impossible to list all of the frauds that have been prosecuted under the False Claims Act, but the followinglist gives some idea of the scope of the false claims on thegovernment that have been uncovered to date: Submitting false records in order to show better-than- actual performance; Performing inappropriate or unnecessary medical procedures in order to increase Medicare reimbursement; Billing for services that were not performed or delivered; Automatically running a lab test whenever the results of some other test fall within a certain range, eventhough the second test was not specifically requested; Unbundling \u2014 using multiple billing codes instead of one billing code in order to increase remuneration; Double billing \u2014 charging more than once for the same service; Upcoding \u2014 inflating bills by using diagnosis billing codes that suggest a more expensive illness or treatment; Billing for brand \u2014 billing for brand-name drugs when generic drugs are actually provided; Upcoding employee work \u2014 billing at doctor rates for work actually conducted by ancillary staff; and Forging physician signatures when such signatures are required for reimbursement from Medicare or Medicaid. GUILTY THROUGH SUBMISSION Here are three examples of chiropractic facilities found to be committing fraud through the submission of falseclaims: Example 1. Dr. X was approached by an undercover FBI agent who was investigating healthcare fraud andinsurance fraud involving Dr. X's chiropractic practiceoperated by Dr. Y. The undercover agent posed as an individual who had been involved in an automobile accident. The agentprovided Dr. X with a document that falsely stated theagent had a claim for $4,550 in lost wages and told Dr. Xthe document was false. Although Dr. X knew the lost-wages document was false, he submitted the document to the undercoveragent's insurance company and sought to obtain paymentfor lost wages in settling the agent's claim. In court, Dr. X admitted he mailed the false document as part of a scheme to obtain payment from the insurancecompany. The attorney explained that this matter is part of \"Operation Settle Back,\" an undercover healthcare fraudinvestigation conducted by the FBI. Four other individuals also pled guilty as a result of the investigation. Dr. Y pled guilty to one count of healthcarefraud and agreed to pay $1.1 million in restitution. T wochiropractors employed by Dr. Y each pled guilty tomaking false statements in medical records while theywere employed at the clinic.

According to papers filed in court, Dr. W admitted he willfully signedand filed a joint 1999 federal incometax return he knew understated hisincome by $799,000. Part of the omitted income consisted of various amounts ofmonies he received from fraudulentlysubmitted medical claims made byDr. A, a licensed chiropractor andothers. Dr. W admitted he knewthose funds were proceeds of anunlawful activity, yet kept theminstead of returning them to therightful owner. Dr. A was sentenced to five years imprisonment and ordered to pay$2,748,881.43 in restitutionfollowing his federal mail-fraudconviction. Dr. A admitted he was involved in a conspiracy with others to defraudpatients and various insurancecompanies by submitting false claimsfor medical services claimed to havebeen performed and receivingpayment for these services from thoseinsurers. Dr. A admitted that during this time, he submitted approximately$5.7 million in false medical claimsto insurance companies. Of that,approximately $3.2 million was paid. Example 3. Mr. L was sentenced by the U.S. District Court on chargesof healthcare fraud. Mr. L, who is nota licensed chiropractor, posed as onefrom 2002 into 2006, performingservices for patients and fraudulentlybilling insurance companies for morethan $600,000. He pled guilty to thehealthcare-fraud scheme. The attorney said Mr. L cheated his patients and defrauded the healthinsurance system by pretending to bea licensed chiropractor for years.According to the attorney, Mr. Lowned and operated a chiropracticclinic since approximately 1995.Because Mr. L is not and has neverbeen a licensed chiropractor, heinitially hired chiropractors to workat the clinic and provide services topatients. However, beginning in or about September 2002, into January 2006,Mr. L no longer hired chiropractorsand instead performed allchiropractic services himself. He alsobilled his patients' insurancecompanies for these services. To mislead insurers into believing he was a licensed chiropractor, andtherefore eligible to receive payment,Mr. L fraudulently submitted the billsunder the name of one of his formeremployees. Mr. L did that withoutthe knowledge or consent of thechiropractor whose name he used. In total, Mr. L fraudulently billed various insurance companies formore than $600,000 and receivedmore than $400,000 by the time hisscheme was identified. Mr. L was indicted and sentenced to two and a half years in prison tobe followed by two years ofsupervised release, and ordered torepay a total of $495,355 inrestitution to the health insurancecompanies he defrauded.

Imaginebuilding your practice on that same chiropractic principle \u2014 insideout, instead of outside in. You can do this by tapping into your No. 1 resource \u2014 your patients. They are on the inside, and can send the message about chiropractic and your practice out to others. To get them to do this, though, your practice has to \"speak\" to them. It has to whisper (or shout!) the messageof chiropractic so they will carry it with them when theywalk out your doors. Here are some practical ways to make your practice speak to your patients, and that \"speech\" will result inmore referrals. Initial phone calls. When a patient calls to make an appointment, make sure your CA asks, \"Is thisappointment for you, your spouse, significant other, oryour child?\" When your CA asks that simple question, she suggests, without saying it, that your practice treats families,including children. Similarly, when a patient calls your office because he was involved in an automobile accident, train your CA toask, \"How many other people were in the car with you?The doctor can be available to see them as well.\" Asimple question, followed by a simple statement,incorporated into the first phone call with a new patient,can be a big practice builder. Office atmosphere. What does your office \"say\" about you and your abilities when patients walk throughthe front door? How are they greeted? Are they made to feel welcome with a warm and friendly hello? Are they made to feelthey've made the right choice by selecting your office?Your patients may drive past several other chiropracticoffices before they arrive at yours. Make them feel theyhave made the right choice. Just as importantly, what shape is your office in? Is the reception area neat?

She can be reached at ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008Does this scenario seem familiar? Sally comes to your officeexperiencing back pain. She learned about you from a friend and heard you did a great job. After her initial consultation and diagnosis, she agrees to schedule visits for the next few months fortreatment. During Sally's visits you tell her about the benefits of chiropractic healing and instruct her on proper spine care.Like many of your patients, during her first few visits Sallyasks many questions and expresses concerns. She soaks upeverything you have to share because she is in pain. After a few weeks of treatment, Sally's back pain is gone and she's feeling noticeably better. She tells you shefeels like her old self again, and begins to miss anappointment or two here and there. Like many patientsyou've seen over the years, she eventually quits comingafter a few months \u2014 feeling better, but not cured. Unfortunately, this scenario replays itself in chiropractic offices across the country. Chiropractors spend countlesshours and much energy generating new clients to replacethe ones who don't stay. They put virtually all of theirtime, energy, and money into obtaining new patients andnone at all into patient retention. Ask yourself these questions: Once patients stop visiting on a regular basis, what do you do to prevent them from becoming inactive andtotally falling off the radar? Do you have systems in place to keep your name in front of patients on a consistent basis? Do you educate patients every time they come in on aspects of caring for their health \u2014 outside of the painyou are treating them for? All businesses have customers that leave. Large companies call these transient customers \"churn.\" Smartmanagers, however, spend time and energy reducing theirchurn because they know it costs approximately eighttimes more to gain a new client than it does to keep acurrent one. Although you will never be able to completely stop patients from leaving, you can put into place processes toreduce their abdication. 1. Evaluate your current retention procedures. What do you do to ensure patients won't forget about youuntil their back hurts again? If someone comes in for treatment for a specific pain, such as lower-back pain, it's your job to do your best tostop the pain. That is what patients expect from you. But it is also your job to convince your patients thatStop the patient-revolving door By Kelly Robbins ECONOMICS WWW .CHIROECO .COM VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008stopping the pain is only part of the treatment if they are to live pain-freefor a long time. 2. Offer extras. Many practices offer free educational classes onnutrition and exercise as an addedbenefit at no charge. Offer theclasses. If patients do not come, askwhy not. Show how the classes willhelp them stay healthy. 3. Keep information flowing outside your office. Send patients home with information on classesyou are teaching (or whatever otherextras you offer) and the reasons whyattending them is important. Give them information to look over when they are more relaxed andat ease. Something as simple as aflyer on colorful paper works fine. 4. Teach while you adjust. Patients cannot tell other peopleabout how you are helping them ifthey don't understand it themselves.To sustain your practice and developlifetime clients, you must teachclients about other aspects of theirhealth (besides the pain they areexperiencing) that benefit from yourcare, and have them recognize theimportance of that. 5. Thank patients individually. A personal thank you lets themknow they are valued. Continue tothank patients even after theybecome \"regulars.\" Gratitude goes along way toward building sustainingrelationships. 6. Pay attention to missed appointments. Act on them right away. Have a prepared \"tips sheet\" orarticle to give or mail to patientswho fail to come in when scheduled.Teach them about the consequencesof missing appointments withoutreprimanding them. 7. Take action immediately. When patients miss appointments,take the time to call them yourselfand see what is going on. Maybethere is a reason you should knowand can address, such as a rude staffmember or difficulty in parking. For the health of your practice, it's important to be proactive about issuesor potential problems rather thanreacting when it may be too late. 8. Produce a monthly e-newsletter.

Providing a \"stress-free day\" at a targeted company will not only be welcomed by employees and management, it will be an open door to your practice. A stress-free day consists of providing employees with 10-minute neck and shoulder rubs, asking them tocomplete a stress survey, and speaking with you aboutways to reduce stress. To put on a stress-free day at a company: 1Target your patients. Some companies provide insurance that offers strong chiropractic benefits. Among your patients, identify those whose insurance payswell. 2Do some preliminary exploration. Find out from the targeted patients if their companies host wellness events, such as a stress-free day. 3Get a contact name. Ask for the name of the human- resources director at their companies (or the person who would coordinate a wellness event). Get permissionto use the patient's name when you make a call. 4Ask for a 10-minute meeting. Call the contact person and ask to schedule a 10-minute meeting to discuss an event that would cost the company nothing. 5Meet and explain a stress-free day. Leave literature describing the event. Explain to the contact person that all you need from the company is space for the eventand help publicizing it through employee e-mail or flyers. 6Set a specific date. Get a written commitment from the company. 7Arrange for massages. Depending on the size of the organization, you may need two or three licensedmassage therapists (LMTs). If you do not have LMTs onstaff, hire them locally. Select those who do chairmassages. Note: Explain to the therapists they will be representing your company exclusively and may only handout business cards from your establishment. 8Attend the event. Ask everyone waiting for a massage to fill out a stress survey and bring it back to you. When the survey is returned to you, invite theemployee to sit for a moment to address any issues you feelyou may be able to help them with. You may choose to do a brief palpatory exam while talking about their stress-free day, or just simply sit andtalk with them. 9Provide a special offer, such as a free exam. As you talk with employees, explain they have insurance benefits that cover chiropractic care. Have your staffmember available to book appointments for the comingweek to see you in the office. 10Follow up. After the event, thank your contact in person and later with a letter saying you hoped employees enjoyed the event, and you would love to do itagain. But don't forget about your potential patients. Follow up with everyone who filled out a stress survey by sendingthem information about your practice, as well as an offer. Follow these 10 easy steps, and you will certainly be on your way to targeting your own patient base for easy,internal referrals.

Green, CEC Did you ever feel like firing your spouse or life partner? If youwork together, it is quite possible. Working in a practice together creates a unique set of challenges. Consider this scenario: You and your spouse have a big argument at home and then get in the car and head to the office in complete silence. You arrive at the office; thetension builds; and you find yourselves tip-toeing aroundeach other all day. As you fume, the staff is well aware of the distinct shift in your energies and they try to keep out of your way. The tension is not good for you and your spouse, staff, or practice. Couples who work well together master the art and skill of communication. They learn the rules forcommunicating with each other in order to avoid a free-for-all, which can lead to resentment and anger. These rules are based on six essential speech acts that allow people to communicate clearly and concisely. Theyare assertions, assessments, declarations, requests, offers,and promises. Assertions. An assertion is a positive statement or declaration, such as \"Albany is the capital of New York.\" Assessments. Assessments are opinions and judgments. Declarations. These are statements made with conviction, which bring about change and a shift in thecurrent reality. An example of a declaration is an umpire'scall at a baseball game or the declaration you are going toswitch to an all-cash practice. Requests. These are attempts to coordinate some type of action to bring about a satisfactory conclusion.Asking for a report is a request; so is asking to have yourdry cleaning picked up.

In an offer, a person puts himself forward for others, such as offering to help a friend move or assist with overload at the front desk. Promises. Promises are commitments to do something, such as to love, honor, and cherish, or tocomplete a report by a requested due date. PUTTING SPEECH ACTS INTO USE To illustrate how speech acts are put to use, consider the case of a couple who worked together, but argued constantly.They rarely agreed on any topic, but, fortunately, had thediscipline not to argue in front of patients. They both assessed that the other person did not listen. That was true; they often were in a self-protective modewhen they spoke to each other and each was busypreparing their defense while the other spoke, so listeningwas impossible. With individual and couple coaching, they began to understand the difference between assessments andassertions. And, each began to recognize when he or shewas asserting instead of assessing. A self-assessment of the 6 ESSENTIAL SPEECH ACTS Here is a self-assessment to help you develop the six essential speech acts. Assertions. What information is necessary to satisfy you when you make a request, promise, or declaration? What information have you left out ofa request? Assessments. What negative assessment have you made today about someone at work that couldaffect the possibilities in your interaction with thatperson? What assessment would you need of thatperson in order to be more productive? Requests. Who is receiving your ineffective requests? What are these requests about? What ismissing from them? Are they requests or demands?What is the cost of making poor requests to yourrelationship? Declarations. What are you not declaring about the action you need to take to improve things foryourself? Promises. What promise have you made recently that you may not be able to keep? Whatwill you do to not break it? What promise do youneed to make to yourself or others? Offers. What offer can you make this week that would help you resolve an office conflict? CONTINUED CIRCLE .COM VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008PERSONAL DEVELOPMENT Within a month of using the essential speech acts, the arguments began to cease. Once the couple stopped arguing, they had to understand and use theconcept of conditions of satisfaction(COS), originally developed by theChilean philosopher FernandoFlores. COS specifies in words whatis necessary to satisfy a request,promise, or declaration. They started to use the request speech act under the condition thatwhen either made a request, theother had the right to say no andnegotiate an outcome that wasbeneficial to both of them. USING COS In the case of the arguing couple, before they learned to request usingCOS, when one person made a requestof the other, their conversation wouldtypically unravel in this manner:Husband: \"I need John Smith's file.\"Wife: \"OK\" (but thinking, \"I'll get to it when I can.\") Missing from the request were conditions of satisfaction. The coupleneeded to clarify: \"When do you needit?\" it?\" \"Is thissomething you need immediately?\" Because the husband omitted considerable information, it is easy tosee how a communication breakdowncould occur. Specifying conditions ofsatisfaction avoids that problem. Here's that same request \u2014 but this time it includes the speaker'sconditions of satisfaction: Husband: \"Could you get me John Smith's file? I need it on my desk by 1p.m. so I can finish his report.\" In this scenario, the wife either accepts the request or renegotiates ifit can't be fulfilled. Remember: A request is just that; it is not ademand. If the receiver of the requestis unable to say \"no\" and negotiatewith the person doing the requesting,then it becomes a demand. When couples work together in a harmonious, loving way, the impacton their patients and staff isremarkable. It is a joy to fulfill yourpractice mission as a couple and builda legacy dedicated to serving others. With solid communications skills and a commitment to a sharedvision, there are no limits to whatyou can accomplish. Amy M. Green, CEC, is a certified executive coach.

Available through the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES), the NPI's stated objective is \"to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of theelectronic transmission of health information.\" Part of that \"efficiency and effectiveness\" is easier monitoring of claims. Your NPI will enable Medicare andother third-party payer's greater access to your clinic byway of profiling. If red flags pop up during this process,you can expect a probe audit to be ordered with a post-payment audit on the way. Red flags are caused by incorrect coding. Proper training in coding is the only way to minimize the risk of audits andfacilitate reimbursements from insurance companies. Currently many billing clerks receive most of their training in two ways \u2014 from vendor-sponsored seminarsor other employees (on-the-job training). Neither of thesetraining methods is a good option because neither assurescorrect information. Vendor training. Despite good intentions, some vendors provide incorrect billing and coding informationthat could lead to a post-payment audit and result in largeamounts of money being returned. On-the-job training. Your insurance clerk may process claims fast and have a good collection rate, but howdo you know he or she is applying all of the correct codes? If your clerk received on-the-job training, bad information may have been passed on. Your practice couldbe losing unclaimed revenues or it could be the target fora post-payment audit, if coding is incorrect. Additionally, if your clerk does not have a way to keep up with the ever-changing world of compliant billing andcoding, your practice can be losing revenue.

In a recent study of 1,400 leaders conducted by The Ken Blanchard Companies, a training company based in Escondido, Calif., managers cited their biggest mistakeswhen working with others. Paying close attention to thesemistakes may be helpful in your effort to manage andmotivate employees. The top two mistakes managers cited have to do with communication. \"Eighty-two percent cited failing toprovide adequate feedback, praise, or redirection as a topmanagement mistake, while 81 percent cited failing tolisten to or involve others,\" says Scott Blanchard, directorof client services at The Ken Blanchard Companies. He explains, \"Some managers don't listen intently; they're not present in their conversations, they interrupt,and they give advice when they should be asking questions.\" The next most common mistake cited by 76 percent of managers was failing to use a leadership style appropriateto the person, task, or situation. \"Some managers are leaving beginners to their own devices, which leaves the beginners confused,\" saysBlanchard. \"And on the flip side, they are overmanagingpeople who are really good at their jobs.\" All of thiscreates a demotivated staff. These mistakes may cost chiropractors top performers, as well as bottom-line results. \"Most organizations don't realize there is a link between leadership and profits,\" Blanchard says.\"Managers must have a constant check on how usefultheir conversations and relationships with employees are.If there are ineffective relationships or dynamics, theyshould take care to address these issues to improve them.Hope,\" he adds, \"is not a strategy.\" Other common management mistakes noted by the Blanchard survey include failing to set clear goals andobjectives, and failure to train and develop employees, citedby 76 percent and 59 percent of managers respectively. Hard-learned lesson: \"Overwhelming research shows that employee passion really drives an organization'ssuccess or failure,\" Blanchard says. \"So ultimately, goodleadership is critical to an organization's success.\" Action step: Ask employees to complete a short survey on your management style. While the questionnaire is nota comprehensive assessment instrument, it may help toidentify overlooked issues. Allow employees to share their input anonymously,with the assurance that nothing they say will come back tohaunt them. Reality check: The first step to solving any problem is recognition. If employee morale or job satisfaction problems do exist in your practice, such a survey may help get theissues out in the open where they can be addressed.

He is 59years old, 6 feet 2 inches tall, and weighs 450 pounds. When he began noticing severe low-back pain, he made an appointment with Dr. Karry, a chiropractor. Dr. Karry took a detailed history and performed a physical exam. He noted possible early degenerative changes as well as disc syndrome. He decided to treat the patient with diver-sified chiropractic manipulative techniques, and instructedLarry to contact his medical doctor to obtain imagingstudies so he could appropriately treat his condition. Larry was such a large man that Dr. Karry's equipment could not accommodate him. Five months passed, and Larry returned with the same complaints. Dr. Karry reviewed his chart and stayed withhis previous treatment plan. He suggested again that Larryobtain an x-ray and MRI so he could assess his condition. Larry's symptoms remained acute, with the exception that he mentioned weakness in his legs. He walked out ofthe office after the treatment and scheduled anappointment for the following week. Ten minutes after leaving the building, another patient ran into the waiting room and said there was a large manlying in the parking lot. Dr. Karry went to the parking lotand found Larry lying on the ground, complaining ofsevere sharp pains with any movement. His legs wereweak and couldn't support his body. Dr. Karry called 911 and Larry was transported to the emergency room, where he was later diagnosed with a discherniation. He was given an emergency lumbarlaminectomy with discectomy because of cauda equinasyndrome (CES). One month later, Dr. Karry received notice of a lawsuit alleging he was negligent and failed to assess Larry'scondition properly with appropriate radiographic studies.More specifically, the alleged malpractice was for theperformance of chiropractic adjustment to the lumbarspine that resulted in paralysis and parasthesia to thelower extremity, along with CES. The lawsuit claimed medical expenses and out-of-pocket expenses, such as a wheelchair, walker, shower bench,bedside commode, and portable wheelchair ramps, as wellas the cost of reconfiguring doorways in Larry's house. Dr. Karry's defense counsel noted that on two occasions Dr. Karry mentioned in the medical record that x-rays andan MRI should be considered. However, the records didnot document evidence that Dr. Karry had followedthrough with these suggestions. The plaintiff claimed if he had had earlier recognition of his overall condition, he might not have been acandidate for chiropractic manipulation. The complaintaccused it was Dr. Karry's treatment that caused a ruptureddisc and apparent paraplegia. The case was mediated and settled.

Informed consent is especially important for high-risk patients, who should be advised of allpotential risks. In this case, informed consent should have been obtained before initiating and continuinga therapeutic regimen of spinal manipulation ona suspected herniated disc, particularly since thepatient was morbidly obese. Follow through. In this case, the doctor performed a complete medical work-up anddiscussions were documented. However, the doctorfailed to follow through with his recommendations. Get x-rays. The nature of the anatomic defect should be determined by radiographic evaluation, priorto initiating treatment.

However, chiropractic is a state-regulatedprofession, and with regulation comes limitations on whatyou can and cannot do in your practice. Although some states may allow an unlimited care at a fixed fee (UCAFF) payment plan, I am not personallyfamiliar with any state that allows a chiropractor to offer aUCAFF program. However, regulations vary, and newlaws and interpretations could allow this to happen. Before you install a UCAFF system in your office, contact and retain a local attorney familiar with healthcareand regulatory insurance laws within your state. The basic problem associated with UCAFFs is that many states consider UCAFF payments a form ofinsurance premiums. In prepay arrangements (for aspecified number of visits), the relationship between thedoctor and patient is narrowly defined, and there is noassumed risk. The patient is essentially paying a specificdiscounted dollar amount for x-number of visits. However, with a UCAFF program, because care is not limited, an element of risk is associated with the agreement.That is, the doctor assumes a risk associated with theagreement made with the patient, similar to agreementsinsurance companies make with insured clients. Since the agreement is for unlimited care for a specific time, the doctor assumes an unknown risk in how manyvisits or services the patient will actually utilize in the office. It is this specific element of risk that creates the underlying problem of the agreement. The doctoressentially becomes a quasi-insurance company. However, unlike the insurance industry, which uses actuarial tables to assess risks in determining the finalpremium amount, the majority of the doctors who attemptto implement a UCAFF system appear to pick a numberbased more on marketing or on what others are doing.Because the doctor can control to some extent when a patient can receive the promised services, there could alsobe an element of fraudulent activities associated withthese types of arrangements. The doctor, in theory, couldagree to unlimited care for the patient then restrict accessto the patient either via days of service or availability ofappointment times. Another issue with UCAFF programs involves patients who are injured in automobile or workers' compensationaccidents. Although some UCAFF agreements containclauses or agreements that remove or modify the offer if thepatient is involved in an automobile or workers' compen-sation injury, the agreement poses a problem \u2014 especially ifan attorney associated with the patient's claim requests youhonor the prepaid unlimited care in order to lower thepatient's medical bills during the settlement negotiations. Will a clause in an agreement that may not be legal within your state actually help you? Probably not. Some states provide mechanisms within their insurance-regulatory departments for the formation of aspecialized entity that may offer programs similar toUCAFF-type terms. This is not an easy process, but maybe one you can explore with your local attorney. Your best bet is to retain a local attorney familiar with your state laws and regulations, with special emphasis onhealthcare and insurance regulations. Also, contact yourstate board of examiners to find out if there are anyprohibitions to UCAFF programs. If after doing these things you find you have a state that allows UCAFF programs, work with your attorney to have awritten agreement that handles all potential situations,including automobile or workers' compensation injuries, soyou will have no miscommunication with your patients.

Q A LIABILITY MANAGEMENT ASK 84FINANCES VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008 WWW .CHIROECO .COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 85Choosing the form and structure of your chiropractic practice isan important decision. Most advisors to healthcare practices believe the avoidance of potential double taxation makes the S-corporation the logical choice. This \"conventional wisdom,\" however, overlooks the potential benefits a C-corporation can offer and does not considera combination of the two types of corporations. A CORPORATION 'PRIMER' Because a sole proprietorship or general partnership exposes you to unnecessary lawsuit risks and does notprovide any tax benefits, when you open a practice, it isbest to incorporate either as an S- or a C-corporation, notas a sole proprietor or partnership. All businesses that incorporate are automatically C-corporations absent an election to become an S-corporation. Both S- and C-corporations have separatetax identification numbers and are required to file taxreturns with the federal and appropriate state tax agencies. Both entities have shareholders. And both entities can be created in any state in the country. When a C-corporation earns profit \u2014 the difference between income and expenses \u2014 it must pay tax at thecorporate level. Reasonable compensation paid tophysicians is deductible by the corporation on its taxreturn (and is therefore not taxable to the corporation). The salary received by the owner is taxable to the owner as wages. After the C-corporation pays taxes, distributionsof earnings already taxed at the corporate level can be paidto the physician-owners in the form of dividends. These would generally be taxed to the physician- owners as qualified dividends, thus leading to the \"doubletaxation\" of such earnings. This drawback, however, isoften overrated. An S-corporation is also a separate entity that must file its own tax return. However, the S-corporation is oftenreferred to as a \"pass-through\" entity. All income anddeductions pass through to the shareholders, and theshareholders must pay tax on any S-corporation income attheir individual rates. Whether the income to an S-corporation is paid to the physician-owners as salary or as a distribution will notimpact the federal or state income tax rates that will beapplied to that income for the physician. The corporationnever pays any tax; therefore there is no \"double taxation\"in an S-corporation. C: NOT SO BAD Mistakenly, many physicians think of S- and C-corporations as having exactly the same benefits. Sincethe C-corporation has a potential double taxation, mostdoctors and their advisors elect to make an S-election toavoid a potential problem. But, you can easily avoid the double taxation problem by reducing practice profits to zero (or close to zero) at theend of the year. Contrary to much conventional wisdom, a C-corporation can be the right choice for many smallentities because of the deductions it allows. The corporate deduction for fringe benefits paid to employees is generally limited for shareholders owningmore than 2 percent of an S-corporation. However, a C-corporation enjoys a full deduction for the cost of'S' or 'C' corporation? Maximize tax deductions by using both! By Carole C. Foos, CPA, and David B. Mandell, JD, MBA CONTINUED CHEC11p85.ps 8:11 ECONOMICS WWW VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008FINANCES employees' (including owner employees') health insurance, groupterm life insurance of up to $50,000per employee, and even long-termcare premiums without regard to age-based limitations. The C-corporation can also deduct the costs of a medicalreimbursement plan. If you have asmall corporation and a lot ofmedical expenses that aren't coveredby insurance, the corporation canestablish a plan that results in all ofthose expenses being tax deductible. Fringe benefits, such as employer-provided vehicles andpublic transportation passes, are alsodeductible in a C-corporation. In contrast, S-corporations have limitations in those areas of benefitsenjoyed by C-corporations. Health insurance paid by an S- corporation for a more than 2percent shareholder is not deductibleby the corporation. The shareholder must generally take a self-employed health insurancededuction on his personal return. Long-term care premiums paid through an S-corporation are alsonot deductible with regard to theseshareholders. The shareholders, indeducting them personally, aresubject to the age-based limitations. LOWER TAX RATES FOR C-CORPORATIONS C-corporations enjoy their own graduated rates. The first $50,000 of taxable income in the C-corporationis taxed at a 15 percent federal rateversus the top marginal rate of theshareholder (currently 35 percent)that the owner of an S-corporationwill be taxed. Even if the owner of a C- corporation forgot to zero out thecorporation and left $50,000 in theentity, the corporate tax would beonly $7,500. A dividend of theremaining $42,500 would only betaxed at a rate of 15 percent, resultingin taxes of another $6,375 andleaving $36,125 (or 72.2 percent). If the 50 percent had been in an S-corporation and the owner had anannual income of more than$300,000, the federal tax rate wouldhave been 35 percent (or $17,500).In this example, leaving $50,000 tobe taxed in a C-corporation wouldactually have saved the owner morethan $3,600 in taxes! Personal service corporations (PSCs), such as attorneys, doctors,and accountants, do not receive thebenefit of these graduated rates sincePSCs are taxed at a flat 35 percentrate. Therefore, PSCs do not enjoythe same benefits of the graduated C-corporation rate structure that .COM VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008FINANCES other types of businesses will enjoy. However, PSCs can take advantage of the full Section 179 expense deduction in writing off furniture andequipment in the year of purchase. C-corporations are afforded their ownSection 179 deduction limitation.Shareholders of an S-corporationmust accumulate the Section 179deduction among each of their pass-through entities, thus they could belimited in a given year. If the practice has rental activity, a C-corporation which is not a PSChas the advantage of using rentallosses to offset operating income.Shareholders of an S-corporationmust treat rental losses as a passiveactivity subject to the passive lossand at-risk rules. BEST OF BOTH WORLDS Many practices can take advantage of both the C-corporationand the S-corporation by setting uptwo distinct entities to operatedifferent aspects of their practices. For example: The S-corporation canbe used for the operating side of thepractice (professional practice ofchiropractic) while the C-corporationcan be used for management functions(billing and administration). In this way, the practice as a whole can take advantage of boththe tax deductions afforded a C-corporation and the \"flow-through\" advantages of an S-corporation. This may also providesome additional asset protection. As long as all formalities of incorporation are followed, as well ascompliance with rules for employeeparticipation in all benefit plans,medical practices can benefit fromthis \"dual\" corporate structure.

HIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS WWW .COM VOL54: I SSUE 11 J ULY 16, 2008Finding and retaining smart employees has long been a keyfactor in the success of many small businesses. For example: The cost of training provided to employees, new as well as those already on the payroll, is usually tax-deductible by the entity footing the bill. Solong as that training is job-related and the employee getssmarter and better able to perform the job, the employerreceives a tax deduction. Naturally, there is no tax cost tothe employee receiving the training. Aside from the tax benefits of this type of on-the-job training, a largely ignored provision in our tax law permitsyou to claim a tax deduction for expenditures made toeducate or train employees. The benefit is also tax-free torecipients. When education is offered as a fringe benefit by a business, the payments received by an employee fortuition, fees, books, supplies, etc., under the employer'seducational assistance program may be excluded from theemployee's income up to $5,250 per year. Although the courses covered by the plan need not be job-related, courses involving sports, games, or hobbiesmay be covered only if they involve the employee'spractice or are required as part of a degree program. And, best of all, your practice may claim a full tax deduction for the amounts paid. To qualify for this tax deduction, however, you must have a formal tuition-reimbursement plan in place. Andalthough these educational assistance programs do notrequire actual or immediate funding by your practice, youmust provide reasonable notification of the availabilityand terms of the program to all eligible employees. Since the practice is not required to put money into the educational assistance plan each year, the programobviously cannot provide employees with a choicebetween educational assistance and other fringe benefitsthat might be includible in gross income. YOU CAN BENEFIT, TOOOur tax laws prohibit setting up a tuition- reimbursement program that discriminates in favor of theemployer, key employees, or other highly compensatedindividuals. Those laws do not prohibit employers frombenefiting from the same perks offered to every otheremployee. Under the tax rules governing educational assistance programs, the term \"employee\" includes the majority ofTax deductions for a smarter workforce By Mark E. Battersby Our federal tax laws contain a tax credit \u2014 a direct reduction of your practice's tax bill rather thana deduction from its taxableincome \u2014 for wages paid toworkers hired from certaintargeted groups of hard-to-employ individuals. The credit is 40 percent of the first $6,000 of wages ($3,000 forqualified summer youth-employees) paid to each memberof a target group during the firstyear of employment, and 25percent of the cost of wagesattributable to individuals meetingonly minimum employment levels. Wages paid to individuals who are certified members of thefollowing groups qualify for thework-opportunity credit: Aid To Families With Dependent Children recipients; Veterans; Ex-felons; Designated community residents (formerly the high-riskyouth group); rehabilitation referrals; Summer youth-employees; Food stamp recipients; SSI recipients; and Long-term family assistance recipients (formerly known aswelfare-to-work individuals).

This option provides the benefits of owning your own business and bringing in your own patients while keeping your startup costs low by working within another officeand using their facilities, equipment, and staff. Why would a doctor want to take on an IC? She may have an extra office and want the additional income fromrenting out the space. Or, he may only work a few days a week, and having another doctor work on his days off would decreaseexpenses. Some doctors also find it convenient to have an IC in the practice to provide patient care when they are ill,attending continuing-education seminars, or takingvacations. TYPES OF IC ARRANGEMENTS You can consider several types of IC agreements. Sublease. One IC arrangement that works well is the \"sublease\" arrangement, in which you run your practicewithin another office. In some cases, you might actually rent a specific spacein which to operate. You would pay rent for the use of thespace, along with time of the staff to answer your phone,receive mail, and possibly do your billing and collections. Percentage. Another variation is to pay a percentage of your collections to the other doctor for overhead. Howmuch you would pay depends on the services the officeprovides. Note: This arrangement may be considered a \"group practice\" and as such would be subject to the Stark laws.For more information on the Stark laws, read \"Grouppractice and patient referral laws: Is your practice incompliance?\" at www.ChiroEco.com/starklaws. Structured. In another form of an independent contractor relationship, you would work under anotherdoctor, during specified hours, and for a percentage of thecollections from your work. This type of IC relationshipmust be structured carefully so it is not considered anemployment relationship. The IRS takes several factors into consideration in determining whether a relationship is employment or anindependent contract, and the agency assumes the workeris an employee unless there is compelling evidence theperson is an IC. CONTRACT POINTS You and the other doctor will need to consult with an attorney to prepare a contract. Here are some issues youboth need to agree upon before talking to the attorney: student DCcomwww.

How and when are those payments made? What is the basis for the payments (rent vs. collections)? How will you separate property owned by both of you (instruments, tables, and office supplies, for example)? How and where will the patient records be maintained? Do you have the right to work for others? (You should have this right, as part of the definition of IC.) Under what circumstances can each party terminate the agreement? Each of you should have the right toterminate the agreement for any reason with appropriatenotice. The agreement may be terminated automatically ifyou lose your license or for violations of law or ethics. What permits and licenses will you need to obtain before starting into practice? What is the term (length) of the agreement? What happens to your patients upon termination? (As an IC, you should be able to take your patients withyou.) What kinds of restrictions are placed on your solicitation of employees or patients? This restriction iscommon in IC agreements. What kinds of restrictions are placed on yourdisclosure of confidential information about the practice?(This is also common.) BEFORE YOU DECIDE Before making a decision about becoming an IC, consider that you: Need to set up your own legal form of business (sole proprietorship, LLC, or other); Must pay for your own malpractice insurance and provide proof of that insurance to the other doctor. Youwill probably have to agree to a \"hold harmless\"agreement with the other doctor, meaning that he or shecannot be held liable for your actions in providing care topatients; Should get insurance on any of your property located in the office; and Need to set aside money to pay your self-employment taxes (Social Security and Medicare) and your federalincome-tax withholding. The doctor with whom you'll beworking is not responsible for these payments.
