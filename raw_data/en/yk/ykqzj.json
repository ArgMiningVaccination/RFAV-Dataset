Dr. Richard is amazing and a life saver!! A friend recommended this place to me and It's been life changing for me!!! Dr. Richard is very professional and listens to you completely. He takes the time to research and look into the latest medical findings. He is very thorough! He's very patient and easy to talk to. They have a variety of supplements at the location to purchase. I really like that it's available. My other favorite is the Engeostol shot (I probably didn't spell correctly.) It helps to boost your immune system. Really helps a ton! Highly recommend! Highly, highly, highly recommend this place ! If your looking for a natural doctor this place is it. Absolutely worth it! If I could give this place ten stars I would!!!!! - 2/13/2023 I was recommended to this place by a nearby business I frequent, but it seems they are probably understaffed and can't keep up with inquiries. I submitted an online inquiry form and left a voicemail last week. I received a call and voicemail two days later but then couldn't get through to anybody when I tried to call back. Thank you anyway! Business owner information David R. 2/15/2023 Hi Wesley, I'm sorry you didn't get a response quick enough, but we are here for you if you would like to know more about how Naturopathic medicine can help you. My assistant will email you, so if you are still interested, respond back and we can hopefully see you in the near future. - 4/27/2020 The best practice by far!!! The doctors care and take their time with you! They also help with natural medicine and me living holistic life is so assuring that I'm putting the best stuff in me and my children and not all the bad chemicals a western doctor would give me. - 3/19/2021 Dr. Meuse is awesome!! I took my son to her for his severe asthma and she found issues that his specialists hadn't found for years! She put him on minerals and vitamins that have helped him tremendously! I refer all my family and friends to her. - 7/8/2019 Dr. Meisel is a life saver!!!! I wish I would have seen her sooner! I saw her at a time when I felt like \"I got nothing to lose\".... She explains everything to you, gives you options and respects your choices, and most of all she cares about you as a person! She's not like other doctors who try to give you a pill for everything. I tell everyone about her! If you got a problem go see her! It's worth every penny!!! - 11/17/2016 I brought my baby here after not feeling comfortable with her pediatric doctor. I wanted a natural healthy approach to her care. We came to see Dr. Stacey Meisel, ND. I was MIND BLOWN with how thorough she was and how many questions she asked me. I am completely confident in the care she receives from her. I also decided to bring myself here as I've been struggling with anxiety and postpartum since giving birth to my daughter. Doctor spent a great deal of time asking me how I felt, and evaluated my health history too to bottom. She came up with a homeopathic plan of action. I'm so grateful that I was able to find her. And I have the upmost respect for her and her profession. She genuinely cares about her patients. - 6/6/2018 I started seeing Dr. Trebilcock in May of this year (2018) I was diagnosed with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and along with that comes many comorbidities. I also got pregnant for the first time and had a miscarriage in January. Dr. Trebilcock and her medical assistant crystal have been soooo amazing and attentive. Dr. Trebilcock is extremely knowledgeable and knows how to take care of her patients on a well rounded approach in my opinion. She is helping me get my health and hormones back in check so I can live life again... she actually listen to you people!!! For the non believers...I'm not paid for any of this... I'm just done with regular doctors. I see and feel the results. Thank you beyond words all of you guys!!! lots of love Heather - 3/10/2015 I am a distance runner and recently, I was advised to try some more holistic approaches to recovery and physical therapy. I was skeptical but thought I'd at least discuss treatment options with an expert before I went back to the foam roller. I met with Dr. Richard a few months back after finding out about Integrative Natural Health through a friends recommendation. After having a long discussion about his practice, I was convinced that Dr. Richard was a good man with a passion for holistic medicine. I've now had three different sessions Dr. Richard and I am very happy with my current performance and well being. I highly recommend this practice for other athletes! - 10/15/2016 Dr. Richard is extremely knowledgeable about nutrition, supplements, exercise, acupuncture and all things related to natural health and integrative medicine. I wish I had started working with him a long time ago. He is what every physician should be but so few are...a truly dedicated healer, a learned scientist and a genuinely caring person who listens well and takes the time to explain things in terms that a patient can understand. He is the best of the best. I cannot say enough good things about all that he has done and continues to do for me at every visit with his focused, non-judgmental and compassionate help. - 11/3/2015 Dr. David Richard became our primary doctor when we found out I was pregnant with our first child. His attention to us during our wellness visits, his extensive knowledge, and concern for our well being is evident. We highly recommend Dr. David Richard. Dr. Stacey Meisel has been an incredible addition to the staff. Since the birth of our daughter she has been her primary Doctor. She sits with us to discuss the well being of our little one with utmost care. She is gentle with her and very caring. We are grateful to both Dr. Richard and Dr. Meisel! A very happy patient and Mommy!
