The course is conducted primarily online, on Zoom. In June, except for restrictions, there will be a four-day retreat in presence in Damanhur (Piedmont, Italy). Class times will be communicated in advance trying to harmonize all the time zones of the enrolled students. All lessons will be recorded and retrievable at a later time. The course includes theoretical parts and practical parts in which to do exercises and meditations. This school activates a process of deep personal healing, but uses the power of the group to enhance these transformations. - What is the Basic Course? This is a two-day course that corresponds to the 1st weekend of the year course.

No, they are not included, but we will help you find the best solutions in line with your needs. - In what language does the school take place?
