Magnet therapy has been utilized to target some autism-related symptoms such as aggressive behavior (e.g., Connect My Brian, 2010). The use of static magnets for health and healing has been classified as a complementary approach of energy medicine by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) (Magnets for Pain: What You Need to Know, n.d.). Magnetic therapy involves the application of static magnets of varying sizes, strengths, and polarity (north and south) to the human body. The magnets are placed on specific points of the body, usually over nerves, joints, or areas of injury or discomfort (please note that this intervention is different from [repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation](https://asatonline.org/for-parents/learn-more-about-specific-treatments/repetitive-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation/)). The magnets are often incorporated into items that are worn on the body such as bracelets, jewelry, wrist bands, belts, shoe insoles, and straps for knees, waist, ankles, and back. Magnets may also be embedded in mattresses and blankets. It is touted that application of these magnets on the body produces an artificial magnetic field which interacts with the body and earth's natural electromagnetic fields to alter a person's bioenergetic fields (also referred to as biofields or energy fields), which surround and penetrate the human body reaching its every cell (see Pawluk, 2020). It is further hypothesized that this alteration increases cell permeability and improves oxygen delivery to cells, which stimulates tissue regeneration. The thought behind this therapy comes from \"biomagnetism,\" which is the study of the effects of earth's magnetic field, and artificial magnetic fields of similar intensity, on living organisms (see Connect My Brian, 2010). Proponents further propose that certain problems happen because the magnetic fields in the human body are out of balance due to injury, trauma, or sickness (Ellis, 2017). These proponents assert that to maintain good health, the body's magnetic fields must be in balance (Ellis, 2017). Though the history of magnets as a \"treatment\" dates back hundreds of years, the sale of magnet products for therapeutic purposes has become a million-dollar industry worldwide (e.g., Finegold & Flamm, 2006). Research Summary: There have been no scientific studies on the use of magnets for individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In fact, even the existing literature on the use of magnets to address pain is characterized as weak and methodologically poor (e.g., Colbert et al., 2008; Colbert et al., 2009). It is important to note that two recent task reports specific to ASD make no mention of magnet therapy. The National Standards Project: Phase 2 (2015) did not highlight any research studies that employed the use of magnets in the treatment of autism. Furthermore, in a review by Hume et al. (2021), no information about magnet therapy was included. Recommendations: Due to a lack of published scientific evidence, magnets are not recommended as a treatment for individuals with ASD. Since magnet use for autism is not researched, there are no official statements from reputable medical organizations regarding safety or efficacy, which further reinforces our recommendation that magnet therapy should not be used. We do not dispute the possibility that some individuals may enjoy interacting with magnets; however, this should be considered a hobby or interest as opposed to a form of therapy. Researchers may wish to consider the methodological limitations associated with studies using magnets for other pain conditions, and conduct studies with strong scientific designs that stand up to peer review, to evaluate the effectiveness of magnets for individuals with ASD. Furthermore, researchers should also demonstrate reliably that individuals with ASD in general, or particular individuals with certain profiles, have an imbalance in their magnetic fields and are therefore suitable candidates for magnet therapy. Providers are urged to review their discipline's ethical guidelines about offering and/or recommending interventions that lack evidence, as there are likely strong prohibitions against these types of recommendations. Additionally, providers should present magnets as untested as a treatment for individuals with autism spectrum disorders and should encourage families who are considering this intervention to prioritize treatments that already have scientific support. If magnets are still used, families are encouraged to work with providers to define targets, implement magnet therapy carefully, and collect objective data to measure benefits. Consumers should proceed with great caution when using any intervention that lacks scientific support.
