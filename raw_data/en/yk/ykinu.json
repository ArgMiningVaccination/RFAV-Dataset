Properties in the Inventory are deemed worthy of recognition and pr otection for their contribution to the cultural heritage of one of the nation's most beautiful and historic cities. 2009 Inventory The D.C. Inventory originated in 1964 , with 289 listings. The 2009 version of the Inventory contains more than 700 designations encompassing nearly 25,000 properties. Included in the Inventory are: 500 historic landmark designations covering more than 800 buildings 150 historic landmark designations of other structures, including parks, engineering structur es, monuments, building interiors, artifacts, and archaeological sites 50 historic districts, including 28 neighborhood historic districts. Properties in the Inventory properties are protected by both local and federal historic preservation laws. The D.C . Historic Preservation Review Board (HPRB) designates properties for inclusion in the Inventory, and the D.C. Historic Preservation Office (HPO) maintains the Inventory and supporting documentation. A component of the D.C. Office of Planning, HPO is both the staff to the Review Board and the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) for the District of Columbia. Searching the Inventory The 2009 version of the D.C. Inventory is presented in multiple formats for convenience. Each of these formats is avail able on the HPO website and may be obtained in an electronic copy. The main or thematic version of the Inventory is arranged to promote understanding of significant properties within their historic context. Designations are grouped by historical period a nd theme (see the Table of Contents) . The development of the District is divided into six broad historical eras, with separate sections on early Georgetown and Washington County, the port town and outlying countryside that were separate legal entities with in the District for most of the 19th century. Within the thematic subsections, related properties are listed in roughly chronological order. The chronology is based on date of construction or primar y historic development, or if the property is significant for association with a person, on the person's period of residence or historical prominence. Informational references to demolished landmarks, National Register properties, and particularly noteworthy contributing properties in historic districts are als o included, as are cross -references to listings in other sections. These informational references are indicated by italics. The alphabetical version of the Inventory is arranged in alphabetical order for quick and easy reference. As with the main version , designated properties are listed along with informational references. For Further Information and Suggestions Preparation of th e Inventory would not be possible without the assistance of numerous researchers and authors, whose work is gratefully acknow ledged. More information on designated properties is available from multiple sources \u2014official designation documents , National Register listings, reference materials on Washington history, and numerous websites. The bibliography provides a brief reference list, but is only a sampling of many available sources . The Inventory remains a work in progress , with some listings provid ing only outline information . Gaps will be addressed as new research and resources permit .

The hand -carved and hand -painted figures \u2014two sleighs pulled by 22 animals including a giraffe, lion, zebra, elephant, goat, camels, deer, and several horses in varying positions \u2014are an important expression of American folk art, reflecting the craftsmanship and artistry of unknown artisans. The carousel is among the d ozen oldest in the country, and one of only two known extant examples made by the U.S. Merry -Go-Round Company of Cincinnati. Its significance is enhanced by an equally rare, fancifully decorated Wurlitzer caliola band organ built in 1937 and added to the carousel at that time.

It was built for diplomat Larz Anderson and his wife Isabel Weld Perkins Anderson, an author, philanthropist, and heiress to a trading fortune. It was also the temporary residence of many visiting dig nitaries. Anderson was descended from a founder of the Society of the Cincinnati, established in 1783 as an association of the descendents of Revolutionary War officers. In 1937, he donated the property to the society for use as a museum and national hea dquarters. The mansion is among the finest works of Boston architects Little and Browne. Its monumental design in the style of the late English Baroque is particularly notable for the imposing avenue fa\u00e7ade. A semicircular entry portico rises within a p aved court enclosed by tall wings and a half -height street wall; views over the wall and through a pair of arched porticos provide glimpses of the private enclave within. By contrast, the south -facing garden front is generously open. Notable among the lavish interiors are a great stair hall and gallery.

(1870 -1945) Multiple Property Documentation; DC adoption January 17, 1990, NR adoption September 7, 1994 Apartment houses comprise a major portion of t he building stock in Washington. Approaching 3,500 extant buildings in total, their numbers alone are indicative of a substantial contribution to the city's growth and urban character. More than 500 of these buildings are historic landmarks or are includ ed within historic districts. Washington had long been a transient city of boarding houses and rooming houses, but the concept of permanent multi -family housing was introduced in response to a severe housing shortage after the Civil War. The city's popu lation has increased by 75% during the 1860s. The earliest apartments, which appeared in the 1870s, were typically in large buildings erected for other purposes, but adapted for multi -family use. An early example was the 1870 conversion of the early -19th century Georgetown school, Miss Lydia English's Young Ladies Seminary (see Colonial Apartments). The first Washington buildings actually designed to serve as multi -family residences were erected in the 1880s by New York developers. The earliest was the Portland Flats, built on Thomas Circle in 1880; the Fernando Woods Flats at 1418 I Street, NW, followed in the same year. About 50 such apartment houses or flats were erected during this first decade of construction. They were typically near the central business district, situated on corner lots for ample light and air. In appearance, they followed the prevailing Victorian taste and were DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 6 complementary to the city's brick rowhouse tradition, then in its Queen Anne and Romanesque Revival phases. At first, apartment living was considered merely a necessity for those unable to afford a separate house. By the 1890s, however, luxury apartment houses were being built, showing an increasing acceptance of multi -family life by those able to afford a choice. As t he government's rapid expansion in the 1890s created further housing shortages, apartment living also gained wholesale acceptance among the middle class. To satisfy housing needs quickly, many large houses were converted to apartments. Several thousand t wo-story flats, looking much like rowhouses, were constructed for the working class. A lasting outcome of this frenzy of speculative apartment house construction was the passage of the city's first height regulations in 1894. In response to a public outc ry over the construction of the Cairo, a 12 -story apartment house just off 16th Street, the District Commissioners adopted legislation limiting the height of apartment houses to 90 feet, and imposing requirements for fireproof construction in tall building s. Height limits were adopted for commercial buildings as well. By the end of the 19th century, real estate speculation by Washington builders and architects increased dramatically. The city's population in 1900 was double that in 1870. By 1910, the pa ce of apartment house construction was nearly quadruple that seen twenty years earlier. Most apartment houses were located along newly installed streetcar lines, creating the beginnings of apartment corridors along 14th Street, Columbia Road, and Connec ticut Avenue, NW. By the First World War, for example, 150 apartment houses were erected within two blocks of 14th Street. Even without streetcars, other streets like 16th Street were similarly developed. These new buildings reflected the current taste for Beaux Arts and eclectic revival styles, including Mediterranean, Colonial, and Classical Revivals. The 1920s were a boom period for new apartment houses and the city's housing stock in general. The decade saw construction of twice as many apartments as in the previous decade. In fact, apartment living was so popular that more apartment houses were built in the 1920s than single -family units, and Washington was ranked with New York and Chicago among the cities with the highest percentage of apartment house residents. In part, this boom was caused by yet another housing shortage due to wartime growth and government expansion (the city gained another 100,000 residents during the 1910s), but it was also caused by the failure of salaries to keep pace with increasing single -family housing prices. Because of inflation and hurried speculative construction, there was also a broad decline in the construction quality of apartment houses built during this era. Several new concepts in apartment construction and ownership developed in the 1920s. Among these were the evolution of multi -building complexes, garden apartments, and cooperatives. Apartment houses with automobile garages also appeared. The era was one of wide stylistic divergence. Revival styles cont inued in popularity, and new styles such as Art Deco and Art Moderne emerged as well. The Great Depression did not substantially diminish apartment house construction in Washington. Due to the government's expansion and the creation of New Deal programs, major housing and office needs continued as the city swelled. The District's population increase of 36% during the 1930s was the greatest recorded during the 20th century. Between 1930 and 1939, more than $60 million was spent on apartment house constru ction alone. During the 1940s, nearly 1,300 apartment houses were built, or 2\u00bd times the number built in the previous decade. Most of these were located in Southeast Washington, which experienced the largest single burst of construction seen in any quadr ant during any decade. In 1942, the federal government also instituted its public housing program in the District.

General Hospital), which was a major teaching institution for the instruction of nurses. As home of the Capital City School of Nursing, it is also a testimony to the struggle for professional recognition for nurses within the medical world. Begun in 1878 as the Washington Traini ng School for Nurses, this was one of the nation's first nursing schools, following those established in 1873 in connection with hospitals in New York, New Haven, and Boston. These nursing schools of the Nightingale Era helped transform nursing from a s ervice largely of religious orders to a medical profession. The school was reorganized as Capital City in 1904, but struggled for years with inadequate facilities and funding. Archbold Hall serves as a visible reminder of the efforts within the community to provide medical services to the poor from the time when such services were regarded as charities to the time of their incorporation within the DC Health Department . Anne Archbold Hall is an impressive example of Neoclassical architecture , designed as a five block, U -shaped brick and limestone building, consisting of two wings and a central pavilion connected by hyphens. It originally accommodated 160 students and a teaching unit with lecture rooms, laboratories, offices, and a large auditorium. The d esign of Archbold Hall stylistically echoes the Classical Revival standard set forth by the Commission of Fine Arts in the early decades of the twentieth century and can probably be attributed to Albert L. Harris, the city's Municipal Architect. Two annex es, of similar materials and design to the original building were added \u2014one in 1939 extending to the east , and the othe r in 1945 extending to the north. The building was named in 1945 for Mrs. Anne Archbold, a member of the city's Board of Charities and a n active advocate for the facility.

Of the four original b ranches of the first national institution for retired and disabled veterans, it is the only one remaining. It was established on the 197 -acre former country estate of noted Washington banker George Washington Riggs, which the government purchased along wi th an additional 58-acre tract using an endowment collected by General Winfield Scott in lieu of pillaging during his occupation of Mexico City in 1847. From 1859 to 1972, the institution was known as the U.S. Soldier's Home, and from 1972 to 2001 as the U.S. Soldiers' and Airmen's Home . Numerous distinguished military officers have been associated with the operation of the home, including generals Winfield Scott, William T. Sherman, Philip Sheridan, and Surgeon General Joseph K. Barnes. It is best known , however, for its association with Abraham Lincoln , who was one of four sitting presidents and their respective Secretaries of War known to have summered at the home. While residing here during 1862 , Lincoln developed his emancipation policy and worked o n the final draft of the Emancipation Proclamation, launching the end of legalized slavery in the United States. As the second highest point in the District of Columbia, the grounds also afforded Lincoln the opportunity to view random skirmishes that occu rred nearby. The h ome was not the site of direct military action during the Civil War , but the Army did use its grounds as a signal post. Situated outside the city's formal limits with panoramic views of the Capitol and city , the historic district includ es a collection of 19th and early 20th century buildings and extensive historic landscapes. The centerpiece of the property is the original Gothic Revival -style cottage known as Corn Rigs . Construction of the asylum began in 1852 with the conversion and enlargement of the Riggs dwelling and the placement of a flagstaff marking the establishment of a military installation. The first three masonry buildings were completed by 1857, and these were followed by periodic construction over next century. The gro unds also include extensive landscapes, recreational areas, statuary, war relics, and other features. There are 39 contributing buildings and a total of 140 contributing properties dating from 1842 to 1951.

Hammon d. Its collect ion of Civil War pathological specimens a nd case histories represented a major scientific research effort to deal with the immense medical problems posed by the war, and to search for means of reducing the loss of life. Comparison of the co llections with Army pension records led to the six-volume Medical and Surgical History of the War of the Rebellion, an early study of wartime medicine. The institution has since remained a leader in pathology and the study of disease . Museum curator Walt er Reed led the commission which identified a mosquito as the vector for Yellow Fever, and curator Frederick Russell conducted the 1907 clinical trials which led to the vaccination of the U.S. Army against typhoid . From 1867 to 1886, the institution was h oused in Ford's Theater, and from 1886 to 1969 on the Mall at 7th Street and Independence Avenue, in a Romanesque Revival building designed by architects Cluss and Schulze. R enamed as a division of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in 1949 , it is cu rrently housed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center; the library is at the National Library of Medicine at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland.

Their buildings represent a distinct, recognizable type that has consistently embodied the highest standards of design and construction. They have traditionally conve yed to the public the important intangible values of prosperity, trust, and solid conservatism. From the historical perspective, there were three primary types of financial institutions \u2014banks, savings and loans, and trust companies \u2014that performed the comm on functions of holding money and making loans. As a group, all three could be distinguished by the yardsticks of the building type \u2014the banking hall and the safe \u2014 but there were significant differences. Banks were fundamentally investor -owned institutions that issued bills of credit (or bank notes), took deposits, and loaned money for interest or discount. Banks typically supported commercial enterprises and credit -worthy depositors. Developing in the mid -19th century, savings banks did not offer bank no tes (or later, checking privileges), but did offer interest on savings. Building and loan associations were similar to savings banks, but with a stronger emphasis on home ownership and mortgage lending. Dating from later in the century is the third type of institution, the trust company, whose functions included the conservation of large amounts of capital through long -term investment. Generally, savings banks served the middle and working classes, while trust companies catered to the wealthy. The Distr ict of Columbia's earliest banks were located in the existing commercial areas of Georgetown and Alexandria. With few banks available, the relationship between some early banks and the U.S Treasury was particularly close. For a period, the Treasury depos ited most of its funds with the Bank of Columbia. Only as the city grew did banking gravitate downtown, where a branch of the Second Bank of the United States was located after 1816. Although no bank buildings survive from the federal or antebellum perio ds, both the National Bank of Washington and Riggs National Bank date from the era. The oldest savings and loan, the DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 13 Oriental Building Association, was established in 1861. To help finance the Civil War and to solve the severe banking problems that follo wed the demise of the Second Bank of the United States, Congress passed the National Bank Act in 1863, instituting the first regulations for the establishment of national banks. The first Washington bank formed under the Act was the short -lived First National Bank (1863 -73), founded by Henry D. Cooke, the brother of financier Jay Cooke. The 1860s and 1870s also saw the first federal regulation of Washington's savings banks. One of the most significant of these was the Freedmen's Savings Bank, which was h oused in a building on the site of the present Treasury Annex. Also notable was the Equitable Co -Operative Building Association, founded in 1879. By the 1880s and 1890s, bank buildings were concentrated in and around the 7th Street business district from Market Square to the Patent Office, and in the area between 14th Street and the Treasury Department. Because of the prestige of this latter location, close to both the White House and Treasury, it became home to the city's largest banks and bank building s. It also became the prime location for trust companies, one of the major innovations in the financial industry at the time. As large corporations accumulated capital and individuals amassed large fortunes, trust companies answered the need for institut ions with expertise in managing substantial funds, free of the investment restrictions placed on national banks. Washington Loan and Trust and American Security and Trust were the first of these companies. Decentralization of banking also began in the 18 90s. Until that time, there were no banks in the northeast or southeast quadrants. The first bank to open outside of Georgetown and central Washington was the National Capital Bank, established on Capitol Hill in 1889. The beginning of the 20th century witnessed an unprecedented boom in Washington's economy, and parallel growth in the city's banking industry. There was an increase in the construction of bank buildings, the largest of which tended to adhere to the monumental architectural idiom establish ed by leaders like Riggs and American Security and Trust Company. There was also exploration of the tall office form, as banking halls and rental offices were combined in a single structure. District banking laws encouraged independent and often short -lived neighborhood savings banks to proliferate in this period. Such banks served individual and business customers in a limited area, and were typically housed in dignified classical buildings to give the institutions the impression of solidity and importa nce. At the turn of the century, there were five savings banks in Washington, with the Union Savings Bank being by far the largest. Between 1895 and 1914, however, the number of savings banks more than quadrupled to a total of eighteen. There was also s ignificant growth in building and loans, to a total of twenty. The trend toward decentralization of banking also increased, as the percentage of banks located outside downtown rose dramatically. Areas like Capitol Hill, Anacostia, the West End, Mount Ple asant, and Columbia Heights got their first purpose -built banks. It was often the smaller savings banks and loan associations that opened first in these outlying areas. The Panic of 1907 exposed inherent weaknesses in the nation's banking system, and in 1914, the Federal Reserve Act introduced the modern system of regulatory controls governed by twelve Federal Reserve banks. For the first time, national banks were permitted to operate branches, to engage in the trust business, and to make loans secured b y real estate. Many Washington banks actively pursued these opportunities, including potential profits in the real estate market. The 1920s saw continued growth, including the creation of new banks oriented toward specific populations, such as union memb ers and government employees. More stable and longer -lived banks owned and operated by African -Americans also appeared. Architecturally, there was a tentative shift in the philosophy of bank design toward modernism. In Washington as in the rest of the n ation, the boom years of the 1920s were brought to a resounding halt with the stock market crash of 1929. Years of widespread speculation, including bank speculation in real estate, left many banks unable to respond to instability. Many did not have suff icient liquid reserves on hand \u2014some DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 14 because so much of their capital was tied up in their own lavish bank headquarters. The first runs on Washington banks occurred in July 1932, when four small banks \u2014the Bank of Brightwood, the Departmental Bank, the No rth Capitol Savings Bank, and the International Exchange Bank \u2014failed. Two months later, after heavy withdrawals, the Prudential Bank was sold to the Industrial Savings Bank. Five months later, a receiver was appointed for the Commercial National Bank, an d six months later, the national Bank Holiday was declared by President Roosevelt. All banks were closed from March 5 to March 9, 1933, and on March 9, the Emergency Banking Act gave the president broad powers to reorganize insolvent banks. In Washington , three national banks and ten savings banks did not reopen after the Bank Holiday \u2014more than one -third of the city's 33 banks. Seven of the unlicensed banks were merged to form the Hamilton Bank, and only one, the Industrial Savings Bank, was subsequently reopened under a new charter. Bank construction virtually halted, and did not fully revive until the 1950s. In the postwar years, design trends shifted towards the treatment of banks as commercial buildings rather than monumental structures. Open, frie ndly, and modern surroundings were in vogue, and modern conveniences became more important. By the late 1950s, both drive -in tellers and walk -up windows arrived.

Bark er Company was constructed in 1906 to supplement its 35 -year- old location at 649 -51 New York Avenue. The company's founder, a New Hampshire -born carpenter, opened his first millwork establishment in downtown just after the Civil War. After his death in 1 889, the business passed to his wife, and then to his sons and his daughter, Flora Welch, who commissioned the construction of the new building. Arthur M. Poynton, a construction superintendent for the D.C. Inspector of Buildings, designed the warehouse a nd presumably oversaw the construction. The significance of the Barker lumber warehouse lies in its scarcity as a reminder of largely vanished kind of building and economy. In a city that was never strongly industrial, working buildings were needed mainl y for production and refinement of articles and foodstuffs for local consumption, as well as for the storage of goods made elsewhere. As a result, small workshops and storage yards were scattered along streets and alleys throughout the city where they wou ld be proximate both to customers and housing for employees. The Barker lumber warehouse recalls the fine -grained mixture of uses once found in the city's urban neighborhoods, especially in the days before zoning. The two - story brick building with heavy timber framing is an excellent and evocative example of its type. Its brick and terra cotta facade now dominates the block, but originally stood cheek by jowl with stores, rowhouses, and a theater. The central entry and loft door suggest their former use for loading delivery trucks and wagons.

The fountain exemplifies the fashion for civic embellishment in French Second Empire taste, while also demonstrating a virtuoso use of new technologies in public art. Rising 30 feet high above a marble pool, and originally plated in bronze, its th ree colossal caryatids hold aloft a large water basin, attended by tritons, reptiles, and dolphins. The garland of twelve light globes circling the rim of the basin was one of the first outdoor displays of electric lighting in the city and helped make the fountain a public attraction.

During the trans ition from segregation to the era of Home Rule, it was the place where William W. Billy Simpson met a demand for a n upscale venue in the African American community where luminaries of politics, government, and entertainment could meet, socialize, and str ategize. Billy Simpson's opened in 1956 and became an immediate success. It attracted important figures and up -and-comers of the government, political and entertainment worlds. Stars like Redd Foxx, Dick Gregory, Ella Fitzgerald, and Sidney Poitier woul d drop in when visiting and performing in Washington, but it was Simpson's political and governmental connections that put him and his restaurant in the network of Washington's African -American establishment. Regular guests included his personal friends Congressmen Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. , and Charles Diggs; the restaurant was also a favorite refuge for Washington's corps of African diplomats, often not warmly welcomed at white establishments. Simpson provided moral, political and material support to the rising black political class and to the causes of the tumultuous 1960s, including the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, the 1968 Poor People's Campaign, and the anti -war movement. Beneficiaries included first Home Rule mayor Walter Washingto n and the Rev. Walter E. Fauntroy, an organizer of the 1963 march and later the District's first c ongressman. Simpson kept his restaurant open round the clock to feed marchers, including Martin Luther King and Ralph Abernathy. He also participated in the strategy and financing to accomplish the defeat of South Carolina Representative John McMillan, an unsympathetic chairman of the House District Committee. In 1968, Simpson's restaurant served as Jesse Jackson's headquarters during the Poor People's Campa ign. Built 1923 (Walter A.

The original Bolling Field, founded in 1918, was located on low -lying tidal flats just north of the present site (now the Naval Air Station). It was named in honor of Colonel Raynal Cawthorne Bolling, Assistant Chief of the Air Service, and the first high-ranking officer to be killed in action during World War I. Between 1918 and 1926, Bolling Field served as Headq uarters of the Army Air Service. It hosted the first Army Air Tournament in 1920, saw many aviation firsts as a base for early long -range endurance flights, including a transcontinental flight by pilot Eddie Rickenbacker in 1921. It was also a center of ceremonial activity, including the return of the Spirit of St. Louis DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 19 after Charles Lindbergh's solo trans -Atlantic flight in 1927, and the awarding of the Congressional Medal of Honor to Rickenbacker in 1930. Since the original field was subject to season al flooding, the War Department began acquisition of the present site in 1930. Construction of the New Bolling Field began in 1932. The new runways were built in 1936, the hangars and control tower were built in 1939, and the official transfer of personn el was completed by 1940. During World War II, Bolling's mission consisted of air transport and support services, air defense of Washington, and combat training. In 1941, the General Headquarters of the Army Air Forces moved to the base from Langley Air Field in Virginia. More than 150 temporary buildings were erected during the first few years of the war, and at peak activity, more than 5,200 people were stationed or housed on the base. After creation of the U.S. Air Force in 1947, Bolling became Headq uarters Command USAF, with a new mission to support special activities and to provide technical training for the Department of Defense. Bolling also maintained facilities for proficiency flying for Washington -based air force personnel until increased acti vity at National Airport led to closure of the flightline in 1961. The base remains the ceremonial and administrative headquarters for the Air Force, housing many command units including the Air Force Honor Guard and Air Force Band, organized at the base in 1941. Eligible for NR listing The eligible historic district includes 75 historic buildings dating from 1933 to 1945, and there is also significant potential for prehistoric and historic archaeological sites on the base. The base was laid out and designed by the Army Quartermaster Corps using standardized building plans used across the country, with regional variations. At Bolling, the dominant architectural style was a variation of the Georgian Colonial Revival, called the Mount Vernon style by Lu ther M. Leisenring, Supervising Architect for the Quartermaster General. Most of the buildings are constructed of red brick, laid in Flemish bond with limestone or cast stone trim, and hipped or gabled roofs. Contributing buildings include: Air Corps Ba rracks and Parade Ground (Building 20): The large consolidated brick barracks for enlisted personnel was the first building constructed on the new Bolling Field. It is architecturally the most elaborate, commanding the main entrance to the base with its broad 49 -bay front. The barracks is set on a fieldstone base on sloping ground, rising 2\u00bd stories on the east end and 3\u00bd on the west. The center entrance is marked by a colossal Ionic portico in limestone, and the cross -gabled end pavilions are marked by brick pilasters and side pediments at a similar scale. A broad open porch extends across the central portion of the fa\u00e7ade on either side of the main portico. The roof is slate. Individually eligible for NR listing Base Dispensary (Building 21): The small 1\u00bd -story hip -roofed dispensary was the second building constructed on the base in 1933. It is rectangular with octagonal end pavilions, a slate roof, gabled dormers, and prominent chimneys. The center entrance is arched, with a paneled door, fanlig ht and sidelights. It is flanked by sash windows set in rectangular openings with stone keystone lintels and sills. The Flight Surgeon's dispensary provided the only medical care on the post until 1941. It faces the Air Corps Barracks at the main entran ce to the base. Individually eligible for NR listing Non-Commissioned Officers' Quarters (Buildings 22 -32): The long row of eleven 2\u00bd -story brick duplexes are representative of the standard base housing of the pre -World War II era. The line of building s faces outward onto South Capitol Street at the main entrance, creating a long public fa\u00e7ade for the base. The buildings are hip -roofed, with dormers and a prominent central chimney, stone trim, and wooden sunrooms at the rear. They were built in 1933. Commissioned Officers' Quarters (Buildings 62 -74): The row of thirteen 2\u00bd -story brick officer's houses (also 1933) are similar to, but more spacious than the NCO quarters. The buildings are set in a long row, with large yards and sweeping lawns. They d emonstrate the Mount Vernon variation on the Colonial Revival style, with pedimented porches on the entrance front and octagonal bays on the garden front. At the rear of each house is a hip-roofed, screened wooden gazebo and brick barbeque grill (built 1934). Seventeen original two -space carports are made of cinderblock with pitched wooden roofs. DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 20 Fire Station and Guard House (Building 5): The two -story firehouse from 1933 is Flemish bond brick with a half-hipped roof, denticulated cornice, and large stone -trimmed apparatus doors. Quartermaster Maintenance Building (Building 11), Quartermaster Warehouse (Building 12), and Air Corps Warehouse (Building 13): These nearly identical warehouses from 1933 are long rectangular one -story buildings with fron t gable roofs, corner pilasters, and large banks of side windows, originally industrial sash. Post Exchange and Gymnasium (Building 15): The large one -story brick post exchange and gymnasium, built in 1933, is distinguished by stepped pediments and Palla dian windows with brick voussoirs. Electrical Substations (Buildings 10, 34, and 36): Small hip -roofed and shed -roofed buildings from 1933 and 1934 housed electrical facilities. Hangars 1 and 2: The two remaining original hangars were built in 1938 -39. They are red brick with concrete trim, large corner piers, and telescoping hangar doors. The segmental arched roofs supported on bowstring trusses are typical of Army hangars constructed after 1934. The large corner piers (one of which originally supported a control tower) were eliminated from the standard Army design soon after the construction of these hangars. Adjacent to each hangar is a small pitch -roofed hazardous storage building of a similar architectural character, dating from 1943. Hangar s are individually eligible for NR listing. Central Heating Plant (Building 18): The 1938 heating plant displays parapet gable ends, a corbelled denticulated brick cornice, large industrial sash windows on the sides, and double end doors set in arched openings under tall steel -framed windows and fanlights. Several chimney flues project from the roof. Headquarters Wing (Building 410): The large, 2 -story wooden building from 1941 is typical of the quickly erected World War II -era headquarters buildings , originally expected to be temporary. The E -shaped building is one of the Series 700 standardized building plans. It is an austere Colonial Revival form with front -gable side wings and a simple wooden cupola. Base Garage (Building 3): The large one -story gable -roofed building from 1941 is similar to the 1933 warehouses. Photographic Laboratory (Building 4): The large two -story hip -roofed brick laboratory from 1941 is distinguished by round -headed dormers, brick quoins, and a pedimented entrance wi th paneled door and fanlight. Base Communications (Building 16): This two -story flat -roofed brick building from 1942 is representative of the wartime construction that greatly increased the density of the base. It is very simply detailed with belt courses and window keystones. Education Center (Building 424) and Band Center (Building 425): These two -story 1943 cinderblock buildings with gable roofs are also representative of temporary wartime construction. Chapel (Building 431): The modest frame building with neoclassical details, diminutive cupola, and gable -end portico dates from 1943 and is typical of the military base chapels provided for worship during the war.

Each Aquia Creek sandstone marker, engraved \"Jurisdic tion of the United States,\" indicates its position, date, and the adjoining state. Only 23 of the original 26 stones remain along the Maryland boundary (NE No. 1, SE No. 2, and SE No. 8 are missing). All were laid clockwise in 1792, following the Virgini a stones, which were begun from Jones Point in 1791. The stones are one foot square with beveled tops. The corner stones were originally 3 feet high, and the intermediate mile markers 2 feet, although some are greatly eroded.

The Capitol is both the seat of government and the symbol of the United States. It has been occupied continuously by Congress since 1800 (excepting o ne brief interruption), and until 1935 it housed the Supreme Court as well. The Capitol has been associated with nearly all of the nation's political leaders. Its legislative chambers have been the site of innumerable debates that have altered the course of history, and the place where presidents, military commanders, and international leaders have addressed the nation. The east and west fronts of the Capitol have been the traditional location of presidential inaugurations. Since the assassination of Lincoln, every president who has died in office has lain in state in the rotunda. The compass rose at the center of the rotunda floor marks the original prime meridian for the country, and is the measuring point for the layout of the city and boundaries of several states. The Capitol has been under periodic construction for two centuries, and is an amalgam of work by an extraordinary series of leading \u2014and sometimes quarrelling \u201419th century architects, builders, and craftsmen. It is the first major example in America of the Federal architectural style derived from English Neoclassicism, and exhibits numerous efforts at developing an indigenous style of architecture and decorative art drawn from the American environment and reflective of American character an d ideals. Its major spaces include unsurpassed Federal and Greek Revival era rooms, and it houses notable examples of American statuary, artwork, decorative arts, and craftsmanship, including the most opulent mid -Victorian interiors in America. Its extra ordinary double -shelled and trussed cast iron dome is a significant and innovative engineering achievement. Seeing the dome as symbolic of the Union, Lincoln pushed ahead with construction in the midst of the war, and the year he began with the Emancipati on Proclamation ended with the raising of Freedom over the Capitol. Congress solicited designs for the Capitol in open competition in 1792, selecting a late entry by William Thornton, a British -trained physician and architectural amateur born and then res iding in the West Indies. Thornton's Georgian design is most apparent in the original facades still visible on the west front. Execution of the work was entrusted to the runner -up, French -born architect Stephen Hallett. George Washington laid the corner stone in 1793, but after construction began and Hallett deviated from the plans, he was dismissed and construction was placed under the supervision of English architect George Hadfield, from 1795 until 1798. James Hoban then succeeded him for completion o f the north wing, which was occupied by Congress in 1800. Construction resumed in 1803 under the distinguished professional architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe (appointed by Jefferson), who revised Thornton's overall design, reconstructed parts of the north wing and supervised construction of the south wing, which was completed in 1807. After British troops burned the building in 1814, Congress moved into a temporary Brick Capitol across the street, and Latrobe began reconstruction. Latrobe's contribution s include revised floor plans, the broad entrance colonnade, and the famous corncob and tobacco -leafed capitals. Latrobe was relieved of the work in 1817, leaving plans for the entire building, but having built only two wings connected by a wooden walkway . He was succeeded in 1818 by noted Boston architect Charles Bulfinch, who completed the old house chamber (now Statuary Hall) according to Latrobe's design, but substituted his own designs for the central rotunda, west portico, and copper -clad wooden dom e. Bulfinch also improved the grounds, adding a terrace around the DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 26 building and a fence with guardhouses at the periphery. The work was completed in 1829. Growth of the Congress and the nation \u2014the number of states had doubled by the 1840s \u2014quickly filled the Capitol beyond its capacity. In 1845, Robert Mills made proposals for extensions, and in 1850, Congress authorized another design competition for expansion. Philadelphia architect Thomas U. Walter won the award, and began execution of his Renaissanc e Revival design for new House and Senate wings in 1851. Two years later, however, supervision of the work was given to engineer Montgomery Meigs, who revised the floor plans and added porticoes on the east fronts of the wings. The House wing was complet ed in 1857, and the Senate wing in 1859. Walter also designed the extraordinary double -shelled cast iron dome constructed during the Civil War. The dome rises to 287 feet, taking its proportions from the size of the greatly extended building. At its bas e, the dome rests on the masonry drum of Bulfinch's dome, but the colonnade encircling Walter's new and higher drum is cantilevered out to a diameter 30 feet greater \u2014a necessary aesthetic and engineering feat that could not have been accomplished without t he use of iron. The unusual openness of the dome, with its three tiers of closely spaced windows, also depends on the iron structural frame. Construction of the dome culminated in December 1863, when Thomas Crawford's statue of Freedom, cast by Clark Mil ls, was raised atop the cupola. Embellishment of the interiors continued in the decades after the war, and even exterior work on the House wing continued into the twentieth century. Carr\u00e8re & Hastings made repairs and alterations in 1901, and in 1949 -50, the House and Senate chambers were redecorated. The east front was extended in 1958 -62, the west front restored in 1987 -88, and offices installed under the west terrace offices in 1991. Construction of a visitor's center and public entrance under the ea st front began in 2002. The original facades of the Capitol are of Aquia Creek sandstone, painted white after the burning of 1814. The Senate and House extensions are of Massachusetts and Maryland marble, the dome painted cast iron, and the east front ex tension gray Georgia marble. At every phase of construction, architects used the ornate Corinthian order traditionally reserved for the most significant buildings. Sculptural embellishment on the east front includes the central pediment group Genius of A merica , carved in 1825 -28 by Luigi Persico (and replicated in the east front extension), the Progress of Civilization (1863) by Thomas Crawford in the pediment of the Senate wing, and the Apotheosis of Democracy (1916) by Paul Wayland Bartlett in the pedim ent of the House wing. Major interiors include the original Senate, House, and Supreme Court chambers (1803 -1819) by Latrobe, by Latrobe and Bulfinch; some incor porate new domes and other alterations (1901) by Carr\u00e8re & Hastings. Notable among the many painted and sculptural decorations are John Trumbull's eight historical paintings in the Rotunda (begun 1817). Interiors in the 1850s wings were designed and exec uted by Walter, Meigs, and Italian fresco painter Constantino Brumidi. Major spaces from the period include vestibules, stair halls, reception rooms, and corridors, notably the Hall of Columns on the ground floor of the House wing. Decorative schemes are characterized by lavish use of marbles, ornamental plaster, scagliola, gilding, fresco painting, and patterned encaustic tile floors. Brumidi's works of art include the Rotunda frieze and fresco entitled Apotheosis of George Washington , at the canopy of the dome.

It inaugurated Capitol Park, a model complex of apartments, townhouses, and landscape that was hailed in its day as the first step toward a new Washington. The building was also important in the in the career of Chloethiel Woodard Smith, a key figure in the development and implementation of the Southwest master plan. Her succe ss with this project led to further commissions in Washington, and helped make her one of few female architects to achieve renown during the mid -20th century. The award -winning design incorporates features of avant -garde European modernism that were new t o Washington, like raising the apartment block on pilotis , and screening balconies from the sun with terra cotta brise -soleil . The original park at the rear of the building was destroyed by the construction of new apartments in 2003 -04, when the pool, vault-roofed pavilion, outdoor hearth, and Dan Kiley landscape were removed and the large mural mosaic by artist Leo Leonni was relocated off the site. Capitol Park Apartments was built on the site of Dixon's Court, long considered a notorious alley slum. Photographs of impoverished conditions in the alley with the Capitol dome in the background were widely distributed, and were even used in Soviet propaganda to illustrate typical living conditions in Washington. When Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev visi ted in the late 1950s, President Eisenhower personally took him to see Capitol Park, then under construction, to illustrate the nation's housing progress. The building is also significant for its role in the landmark Supreme Court ruling in Berman v. Park er, which broadened the interpretation of the public welfare to include aesthetic purposes like a better urban environment. The property taken by the government and at issue in the case was part of the apartment building site. Despite being DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 28 planned to accommodate residents of a variety of incomes, Capitol Park did not achieve its social goals, and along with the rest of the Southwest urban renewal, it has been symbolic of the huge social costs that were borne most directly by the displaced residents of Southwest, mostly African -American, and by the city at large as the social and physical fabric of entire communities was destroyed.

When built, it was believed to be the largest building owned by any local union in the United States. The Washington local was closely associated with Gabriel Edmonston, leader of the city's first carpenters' union, and first president of the national union (both established in 1881). Edmonston and the United Brotherhood were instrumental in the formation of the American Federation of Labor, the fight for the eight -hour work day, and the creation of the Labor Day holiday. The eight -story red brick and limestone building, designed by local architect O. Harvey Miller, is a typical commercial office block, yet distinctive for its Colonial Revival facades (which m ay allude to Carpenters Hall in Philadelphia, home of the nation's oldest trade guild and site of the first Continental Congress). For many years the building housed a Carpenters Hall on the top floor, as well as offices for other union organizations. At the height of the union influx into Washington, it was one of several labor headquarters clustered near the American Federation of Labor on Mount Vernon Square.

The building was one of a number of collaborations between architect Harvey H. Warwick and developer Morris Cafritz. It is a visual landmark i n Columbia Heights in part because it immediately adjoins the public sidewalk, stands 90 feet tall at the roof peak, and occupies frontage along an entire block. The density of the development illustrates the rapid growth on major suburban thoroughfares i n the post -World War I era, largely directed by the streetcar system and a new zoning ordinance. It was among the earliest cooperative apartments in the District of Columbia, a housing phenomenon that arose here in the 1920s, promising to give more contro l to resident owners and afford a high level of services by spreading costs among them.

Built across from Battery Kemble on a road that still retains its character as a rural lane, it replaced an 1865 frame schoolhouse on the site. Although a product of the prominent and prolific Municipal Architect, Albert Harris, the school is atypical of his work, and much plainer than its contemporaries. The hip -roofed building is poured -in-place concrete on the first story, and frame on the upper story, uniformly clad in stucco, with large ganged multi -pane windows and a Colonial Revival entry surround.

It was the cit y's largest and most innovative of its time \u2014and also the most expensive. Since this outlying area was beyond the reach of the municipal water and call -box systems, Col. Arthur E. Randle, a real estate speculator and developer of much of the area, donated land for the purpose, no doubt to increase the confidence of prospective purchasers. Initially housing just a chemical company, the building had a full three apparatus bays and beds for fifteen men, permitting expansion with additional engine and truck co mpanies. Other innovations included an observation tower, the first steel truss roof, and a new system that released horses from their stalls automatically and in sequence. The building exemplifies the eclectic, high -style firehouses of the City Beautifu l era. Its classically inspired Italianate revival design, in red brick with hipped roofs of terra cotta tile, bears a striking resemblance to the new campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital, built in the same year just nearby.

The soaring seven -story building, designed by architects Voorhees, Gmelin and Walker (successor s to McKenzie, Voorhees & Gmelin), was executed with Art Dec o detailing and ornamentation. On May 3, 1930, the Company began its first conversion to dial when 60,000 telephones in downtown Washington were switched over from the manual system.

Designed by architect Leon Eidlitz, t he new building housed a complex new common battery switchboard, touted at the time as the DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 33 largest in the United States. This new switchboard initially served 6,000 telephones , beginning in September 1904 . The new exchange offered a number of benefits in cluding the elimination of multiple rings on party lines , and eliminating the need for the operator to interrupt the line to determine whether the subsc riber was finished with a call or intended to receive calls. This central exchange was the first in what would be a complex of C&P Company buildings at this location.

The company's largest building when it opened, i t is both an excellent example of an industrial interpretation of the Art Deco style, and an essential compon ent of an integral system of buildings designed not just for function but to evoke the modernity of a consumer product. The stepped parapets along the roofline, subtle vertical accents at the corner bays, and front entry detailing provide the building's c lear architectural expression of the style.

Chartered by Congress in 1866, the hospital was the primary maternity facility in the city, and the birthplace of about 275,000 individuals \u2014the vast majority of all persons born in the District of Columbia during the twentieth century. Until it closed in2002, Columbia was also a leading national and international innovator in women's and infants' health. In 1919, it established a prenatal care program, and in 1925, it was the first hospital to use babies' footprints for identification. It was one of the first maternity hospitals to establish nurseries for premature infants, and the first to provide classes for ex pectant fathers. It was also a leader in the DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 37 care of children, with its Clinic for Children giving rise to Children's Hospital. Columbia Hospital was first located at Thomas Circle, but in 1876 it moved to the present site, where it used the former Mayna rd Mansion as a nurses' home. The present five -story structure, built in 1916, overlooks Pennsylvania Avenue from a gentle rise in the center of the block. The Italianate design by architect Nathan C. Wyeth is extraordinary for its sculptural complexity. The tall central block (originally crowned by a rooftop loggia), is flanked by gable - roofed transverse wings with open towers, which rise above two Y -shaped wings that project forward, ending in open sun porches. Facades are golden tapestry brick with l imestone trim and terra cotta roofs. The design highlights the importance of light and air in medical thinking of the day.

The order arrived in the United States in the 1880s, establishing itself in Baltimore. The first nuns came to Washingto n during the typhoid epidemic of 1905, and provided much needed nursing and home health care, particularly during the catastrophic outbreak of Spanish Flu after World War I. The sisters first occupied the old rectory of the adjacent Saint Ann's Church, and built this 2\u00bd -story buff brick convent in 1927 -28. The design by Irish -born architect Maurice F. Moore clearly articulates its residential and religious aspects, with a hip -roofed main dormitory block, side chapel, diminutive arcaded tower, and rear log gias suggesting a Renaissance cloister.

Weaver Federal Building) 451 7th Street, SW The HUD Building was the first government building to be constructed under the seminal Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture written by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a lifelong advocate for urban design excellence, and introduced by President John F. Kennedy. These principles promoted federal govern ment architecture that would reflect the dignity, enterprise, vigor and stability of the American National Government, and embody the finest contemporary American architectural thought. It also symbolized the values of a newly created cabinet -level de partment committed to addressing the urban decline caused by the wave of post -World War II suburbanization. The HUD headquarters was designed by world -renowned French architect Marcel Breuer and his associate Herbert Beckhard, for a site in the Southwest urban renewal area that would show the federal government's commitment to urban reinvestment. Breuer used concrete in bold and innovative ways to create an Expressionist building with a sweeping, curvilinear X -shaped form. This represents the first use o f precast and cast-in-place concrete as the structural and finish material for a federal building, and it was also the first fully modular federal building. The building was renamed in 1999 to honor Washington native Robert C. Weaver, who served as Lyndon Johnson's HUD Secretary from 1966 -68, and was the first African -American member of a Presidential cabinet. The building was constructed from 1965 to 1968, and includes a 1990 plaza redesign by landscape architect Martha Schwartz.

Dumblane was erected for physician Mabel Cornish Bond and her husband, attorney Samuel Hazen Bond. They derived the design for the house from plans published in 1904 in Stickley's magazine The Craftsman , then the leadin g voice of the movement. The house illustrates numerous Craftsman ideas, including a preference for natural, often rustic local materials, an openness and flexibility of plan, and conveniences for comfort and efficiency. The house is set on a large lot a t the edge of Tenleytown, approached by a circular drive leading through rubble DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 45 stone entrance piers and past the garage workshop. It is made of brick with a green tile roof and large openings with ganged windows. Despite its two -and-a-half-story height, the house has a distinct horizontal emphasis, surrounded by a pergola and porches that open it up to sunlight, fresh air, and the garden. While the Bonds generally followed the published plan, they customized the house a bit in plan and details, as Stick ley encouraged in the spirit of the style. Hazen Bond superintended construction and, presumably in his garage workshop, crafted furniture and built -ins for the house. The interior is largely intact, featuring straightforward exposed wood beams, floors, paneling and stairway, and a large hall fireplace with a facing Inglenook. An illustrated article on the house appeared in The Craftsman in February 1913.

The parks were a primary feature of the McMillan Commission Plan, the nation's preeminent manifestation of the City Beautiful ideal of grand civic space. They are the cumulative product of a century of work by noted American architec ts. They are the setting for the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials, the Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial, Vietnam and Koran War Veterans Memorials, and many others. They include nationally recognized works of art, most notably Daniel Chester French's statue of Abraham Lincoln. The parks were created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in one of the city's most ambitious reclamation projects. Intended to improve both river navigation and the sanitation of the Potomac Flats, the reclamation project lasted for more than 30 years, beginning in 1882, and created more than 730 acres of new land enclosed by stone seawalls. Under an 1897 Act of Congress, the reclaimed land was reserved for recreational use. The McMillan Plan reserved the interior of West Potomac P ark for passive recreation, and spaces for active recreation were later sited on the park's fringes. During both World Wars, land in the parks was used for the construction of office and dormitory buildings to support the war effort. The parks are charac terized by broad expanses of open space framed by mature landscape plantings and historic boulevards and drives. They have been managed by a succession of government agencies, beginning with the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds, and currently the Na tional Park Service.

Reclamation of the land was completed in 1911, and it was transferred to the Office of Public Buildings in Grounds for park use in 1912. The completion of Ohio Drive in 1916 allowed access to the park, and a development plan dating to the same year set the framework for the construction of later, primarily active, recreational amenities. In 1966 -68, approximately 1,800 Japanese Cherry trees were planted along Ohio Drive around the perimeter of Hains Point. These trees were planted by friends of President and Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson in honor of their nationwide Beautification Program.

The park contains the nation's foremost collection of commemorative structures, which together represent the definitive history of 20th-century American memorialization. A number of its landscape features, including the Tidal Basin cherry trees and rows of elms flanking the Reflecting Pool, have become symbols of Washington, D.C., as have the landscapes associated with the Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials. The park has also become a continued venue for significant na tional social gatherings and demonstrations. In particular, the Lincoln Memorial has become an icon in the civil rights movement, best known as the location of such defining moments as Marian Anderson's 1939 Easter Sunday Concert, and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s I Have a Dream speech in 1963. The nation's annual Fourth of July celebration centers on the park and the adjacent National Mall. Newer contributing features of West Potomac Park include Constitution Gardens (1976), 56 Signers Memorial (1981), Viet nam Veterans Memorial (1982), Vietnam Women's Memorial (1993), Korean War Veterans Memorial (1995), and Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial (1994 -97).

Although the portion of Appropriation No. 1 surrounding the White House and departmental buildings was landscaped and enclosed during the first ha lf of the 19th century, the large expanse to the south, between the White House and canal remained for decades an unimproved open common surrounded by a shabby white fence. In 1851, the Commissioner of Public Buildings under President Fillmore secured ren owned landscape designer Andrew Jackson Downing to propose landscape schemes for the city's parks. While Downing retained the configuration of roads around the President's House, he prescribed new treatment for the southern part of that appropriation. In this large common, he inscribed a large round lawn circled by a roadway labeled Parade or President's Park. Downing's unexpected death in 1852 and the outbreak of the Civil War halted implementation of these plans for several decades, but the Ellipse w as largely graded and planted by 1887 in the form that remains in place today. Over time, monuments and trees have been installed around the edges, but the essential character of the area has remained constant, as has its use for both formal and informal gatherings.

The scheme was brought to fruition in the decades after 1900 largely through the efforts of Mary Foote Henderson, who built nearly a dozen embassy buildings near her residence on the street. She succeeded in attracting a few for eign governments to follow suit, and the Embassy of Italy, built i n 1924 -25 on land the Italian government purchased from Mrs. Henderson, is among the most notable of these. The embassy is a distinguished example of Beaux -Arts design in the Italian Renaissance style, illustrating the effective adaptation of the style fo r use both as an imposing residence and a statement of national identity. It is one of only two known buildings in Washington designed by Warren and Wetmore, the prominent New York firm perhaps best known as the arch itects of Grand Central Station. The property also includes a chancery addition from the 1930s.

It w as built at a time of changing technology, including the development of a neighborhood call box alarm system. The firehouse was one of the first built with an electrical system, but it also took advantage, possibly for the first time, of the innovation of using the hose tower for observation. By 1905, it became Engine Company No. 17. The firehouse is a good, late example of Romanesque Revival, and has been a visual landmark of Brookland since it was built. Its construction had been requested for years by the Brookland Citizens' Assoc iation, and on opening day, it was hailed as heralding greater prosperity for the new suburb. The building was constructed with a combination of DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 51 load-bearing masonry and structural iron; its unusual asymmetrical design is probably the work of Municipal Architect John B.

Because it served suburban areas beyond public water service and the street alarm sy stem, Engine 19 housed a chemical engine and its hose tower doubled as a lookout post. The District of Columbia had no firehouses east of the Anacostia River until 1898, and this station erected in 1910 was only the fourth in that area. The firehouse was designed by the short -lived Washington firm of Averill and Adams, one of several private firms engaged to create unique firehouse designs \u2014succeed ing the standard red - brick Victorian model \u2014under the supervision of the new Office of the Municipal Architect. A landmark of Randle Highlands since its construction, Engine 19 is also historically significant for its 100 -year association with the District of Columbia 's professional firefighting and rescue services, and their role in the protection of lives and pr operty. DC designation July 23, 2009; DC ownership Engine Company No. 20 (Tenleytown Firehouse ) 4300 Wisconsin Avenue, NW The Tenleytown Firehouse was the first major public structure built in Tenleytown. Its erection in 1900, when the area was still at the edge of the countryside, followed soon after the platting of the residential subdivisions of Armsleigh Park (1892), American University Park (1897), and North Cleveland Park. By enabling full -scale housing development, the firehouse both signaled and hastened the absorption of the former crossroads settlement into a growing metropolis. Officially Engine Company 20, the firehouse was designed by noted architect Leon Emile Dessez, Jr., in an Italianate Revival style. Facades are glazed buff brick and terra cotta, with overhanging scrolled eaves, terra cotta tile roof, and an expressed hose tower. In 1913, with the addition of Municipal Architect Snowden Ashford's one -story annex on the site of the former horse yard, it became the second motorized stat ion in the city. The firehouse retained most of its exterior and interior features prior to rehabilitation, in which only the facades are to be retained.

The Spanish Mission Revival style building is attributed to architect Appleton P. Clark, who lived nearby. Due to its proximity to several multi -story apartments, including the sprawling Ontario Apartments (1904) , the station received the city's longest hook and ladder truck.

In that year, the fire department completed its conversion to all -motorized apparatus, enabling a more rapid respons e and necessitating fewer firehouses overall. But facilities grew larger, and in outlying suburban areas, more land was available to spread the stations over a more convenient single floor. The design is among the most successful of Municipal Architect A lbert Harris. Following neo -Georgian principles, the main block of the front -gabled brick building is symmetrically composed, but the dormitories are placed to the side in a secondary wing, creating a T -shaped plan. A majestic four -story hose tower rises at the rear, balancing the design and creating a conspicuous neighborhood landmark.

Equitable was the largest building association in the country by the late 1880s. It embodies the historical associations and architectural expression of these important institutions, and is an exceptional example of Classical Revival bank architecture. Equitable is a lso associated with the career and ideals of the distinguished civic leader and progressive reformer John Joy Edson. The building, constructed in 1911 -12 (with 1919 alterations) is a notable work of local architects Frederick B. Pyle and Arthur B. Heaton.

See Bibliography (Goode, Washington Sculpture) The Euclid 1740 Euclid Street, NW This elegant structure typifies the mid -rise apartment buildings that became increasingly popular in streetcar suburbs of early -20th century Washington, especially after the city's exponential growth during World War I. Multi -family dwellings had been slower to gain acceptance in Washington than in other cities like Boston, New York, and Chicago, but once accepted, apartment buildings became a major component of the city's architectural fabric and heritage. The Euclid was built in 1919 -20 by owner Howard M. Etchison, among the most prominent of Washington 's early -20th century developers. The architect was Claughton West, who designed more than 600 houses and 40 apa rtment buildings in his long career.

In the 1930s, she performed at the White House for Eleanor Roosevelt and served as a Goodwill Ambassador to South America. In 1942, she helped found the Negro National Opera Company. The two -story brick rowhouse, designed by architect R.E. Crump, was built in 1894; Madame Evanti added decorative iron railings with stylize d harps or lyres in a 1932 remodeling.

A Swedenborgian congregation was fully established in Washington by 1846, and in 1858 had built a church just north of the Capit ol. After that structure burned in 1889, the church built both a national church on 16th Street and this separate African -American church near U Street, on the lot of an old frame chapel that had been moved to the site in 1879. Paul Johann Pelz, the asso ciate architect of the national church, and one of the city's most prominent architects, also designed the African New Church. The brick building is far more modest than the imposing stone national church, but similar in some respects, including its pictu resque massing, corner tower, and Romanesque Revival detail. The layout reflects specific New Church doctrine, with a lower sanctuary for baptism and instruction, and an upper sanctuary for worship. In 1905, the People's Seventh Day Adventist Church purc hased the building. It was the city's first African - American congregation of that denomination as well, although by the 1930s it had become the People's Seventh Day Baptist Church (remaining until about 1960).

In addition to its original use for defense of the city, it has also served as a penitentiary, barracks, hospital, and college. By 1794, a one -gun battery and defenses were in place at Greenleaf Point, and i n 1803, an arsenal building designed by George Hadfield was built on the site. Called the Washington Arsenal, it was the main storehouse for munitions in the city. The fort was destroyed by British troops in 1814, but rebuilt and enlarged by 1816. Betwe en 1826 and 1831, the Federal Penitentiary for the District of Columbia (designed by Charles Bulfinch) was built on a site just north of the Arsenal. The arsenal was enlarged to 69 acres in 1857 for construction of a hospital, and during the Civil War it housed 1,000 beds for care of the wounded. Large quantities of ammunition were manufactured at the Arsenal during the war, and an 1861 explosion there caused the city's largest loss of life during the war. In 1862 , the penitentiary was closed due to the expanded activities of the arsenal. The penitentiary is historically significant as the site of the imprisonment and trial of the conspirators in President Lincoln's assassination. Mary Surratt and three others were hanged in the prison courtyard on July 7, 1865. The penitentiary cell block and courtyard walls were razed in 1867, but the administration building where the trial was held still remains. The arsenal was closed in 1881, and the post transferred to the Quartermaster Corps , as Washington Barra cks. Major Walter Reed, a faculty member at the U.S. Army Medical School from 1893, conducted exhaustive research on malaria at the post hospital and nearby Potomac tidal flats; in 1898 he reported his findings identifying mosquito es as carriers of the di sease. That same year, DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 58 the post hospital was designated as the Army General Hospital ; it was later renamed in Reed's honor and remained at Fort McNair until 1909, when it moved to i ts curre nt location on Georgia Avenue. Fort McNair was transformed after the Spanish -American War of 1898, as part of the modernization of American military forces and military education systems. With the birth of the Army War College in 1901, the post became the Army's center for the education and training of senior officers. Then entire installation was redesigned by McKim, Mead, and White as a Beaux -Arts campus around the war college building on Greenleaf Point; this remains its primary character today. In 1924, t he Army Industrial College was founded at McNair in to prepa re officers for high level posts in Army supply organizations, and to study industrial mobilization. It evolved into the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. The Army War College was reorganized as the Army - Navy Staff College in 1943, becoming the Nat ional War College in 1946 and National Defense University in 1976. The post was renamed in 1948 to honor Lt. Gen. Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army ground forces during World War II, who was headquartered at the post and killed in Normandy in 1944. For t McNair has been the headquarters of the Army 's Military District of Washington since 1966.

The innovative Rundbogenstihl (round -arched style) design by Washington's preeminent German -American architect Adolf Cluss won international award s for modern public school design at the 1873 Vienna, 1876 Philadelphia, and 1878 Paris World Expositions. The building was the site of Alexander Graham Bell's photophone experiments in 1876, and housed the city's first designated high DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 60 school in 1880. It served as an elementary school until 1925, and housed the administrative headquarters of the school system from 1928 to 1968. The polychrome exterior, fully restored in 1990 -92, is composed as a massive central block with side wings and facades of red brick and limestone, with turreted octagonal ventilation towers, patterned mansard roof, and cast iron trim including a bust of Franklin. Impressive volumetric spaces constitute the most important features of the interior. Notable are the broad twin stai rcase (reflecting the practice of segregating the sexes), the Great Hall with remains of the original frescoes in an architectural trompe l'oeil design, and the remarkable timber -frame roof truss system.

The square was first graded in 1853, and further improved in 1864 -66, when walks and beds were laid out, sodded, and planted. As early as 1868, a watchman's lodge was constructed, and in 1914, the statue honoring Irish -American naval hero John Barry was installed.

It was acquired as one of the original Federal appropriations, apparently for use as the seat of city government. The square was first improved from about 1883 -87, but maintenance of the ar ea proved difficult given its proximity to industrial uses. In 1892, it suffered further damage when the Grand Army of the Republic camped there during its annual reunion. Beginning in 1903, the 24 -acre park was pared to about 9 acres by land transfers t o the Pennsylvania Railroad, for construction of the Capitol Power Plant in 1905, and for construction of the Southeast/Southwest Freeway in 1969.

NHL designation and NR listing, December 4, 1991 General Post Office (General Land Office) E, F, 7th, and 8th Streets, NW This beautifully scaled and finely detailed building, with exceptionally fine interiors, is a tour de force of restrained neo -classical deign and an outstanding example of American civil architecture. Built in two stages from 1839 to 1866, the building is the work of Robert Mills and Thomas U. Walter, two of the most noted 19th- century American architects. The design of the building, based on a traditional Renaissance palazzo, is the first use of the Italianate style for an important public building in America; it also was the first use of marble for one of Washington's public buildings. Both Mills and his contemporaries considered the building his masterwork. The southern section of the General Post Office stands on the site of the Samuel Blodgett's Great Hotel, the first large building in downtown, built in 1795 and purchased by the government in 1810 to house the Post Office Department, City Post Office, and Patent Office. In 1814, Blodgett's Hotel was the only government building in Washington left unburned by the British, and it became the Hall of Congress for a short period thereafter. Blodgett's burned to the ground in 1836. By 1839, construction was started on the south section of the present building, designed by Robert Mil ls for use as the Post Office Department and City Post Office. These offices moved into the building about 1844, but quickly outgrew their space limitations, and in 1855, construction was begun on the north extension designed by Thomas U. Walter. Apparen tly, consulting engineer Montgomery DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 64 Meigs suspended construction of the north wing in 1861, and the building was not completed until 1866. During the War, the basement was used as a Union supply depot. The Post Office Department and City Post Office occu pied the building during this entire period, and it was from here that Postmaster General Montgomery Blair initiated home delivery in 1863. Other notable Postmasters General who greatly modernized the postal system were Joseph Holt, Horatio King, and John Wanamaker. In 1897, upon completion of the new Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue ( see Old Post Office ), Congress transferred the building to the Secretary of the Interior. After this transfer, it housed the General Land Office and the Bureau o f Education. One of the government's first central power, heating and lighting plants, located in the basement, served the Pension Office, the Patent Office, Court House, Court of Appeals, and Bureau of Mines. Interior Department occupancy continued unti l 1917, when its new offices were completed at 18th and F Streets ( see Interior Department Offices ). After U.S. entry into World War I, the Army operated the National Selective Service Board from the building, and in 1919, General John J. Pershing occupie d the building while preparing his final reports as Commander -in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces. After Pershing's departure in 1921, the Tariff Commission first occupied part of the building, and from 1940 until about 1990 it occupied most of the structure. Although built in sections, the exterior is a harmonious composition, articulated by Corinthian pilasters and columns, with only minor differences in detail. The Mills wing is of New York marble, and the Walter section of Maryland marble. The keystone above the 8th Street carriageway entrance displays a carved female head representing Fidelity , and bas -reliefs in the spandrels of winged figures bearing a thunderbird and locomotive, symbolizing Electricity and Steam , respectively. These we re sculpted by Guido Butti in 1856. Outstanding interior features in the Mills wing are the groined and barrel -vaulted corridors with plaster friezes on the main floor, two graceful curved cantilevered granite stairways in domed alcoves, and the vaulted t hird floor main hall with a domed central skylight. In the Walter section, the structural system of cast iron beams supporting segmental brick vaults is characteristic, and the wrought iron roof trusses are among the earliest documented examples of rolled I-beam construction. The granite pavilion that housed Walter's mail receiving room remains in the central courtyard, but his original two -story dead letter office, the major architectural space of the north wing, is only partially preserved.

One of the last parkways completed among the many in the eastern United States, George Washington Memorial Parkway preserves a sizable amount of the natural terrain once familiar to George Washington, providing unparalleled views of the city he founded and the river he traveled. It is associated with a long and continuous planning effort for the Washington region, begun with the L'Enfant Plan, extended with the Permanent System of Highways Plan of 1898, a nd reinvigorated with the McMillan Plan of 1902. Well -known landscape architects Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., Charles W. Eliot II, and Gilmore D. Clarke invested much time and energy in the planning and execution of the parkway. It was authorized by the C apper -Cramton Act of 1930, and constructed in stages from 1930 to 1966. The parkway also commemorates George Washington's association with the Potomac River, including his enterprising efforts to tap the hinterlands through canals along the river, his est ate at Mount Vernon, and his selection of the site for the nation's new capital. The DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 65 commemoration of Red Cross founder Clara Barton, for whom the Maryland segment of the parkway was named by an Act of Congress in 1989, is notable as well.

Founded in 1890 by financier and Washington Post founder Stilson Hutchins, t he Palisades of t he Potomac Land Improvement Company planned to develop l and on both sides of the river between Georgetown and Great Falls. The company's expectations apparently rested on taking advantage of low land prices , lovely topography , and the likelihood of a new streetcar line to Glen Echo , approved by Congress two years later and completed in 1895. But the residential building boom in the Palisades did not occur until after the turn of the century , peak ing in the 1910s and 1920s when more modest homes designed b y builders or even ordered by mail were the norm. T he handful of large architect -designed 1890s homes illustrate the subdivision's character before arrival of the streetcar, when it was home to a few upper -middle -class residents who could afford personal conveyances. Glen Hurst was the home of real estate broker John C. Hurst, one of the original Palisades promoters . The architect, Richard Ough, was also intimately involved in the development project, designing not only Glen Hurst, but his own home there and the remaining three original houses. Glen Hurst is a substantial stone and frame Queen Anne -style house constructed in 1892 or shortly thereafter. It is a relatively high -style example for this area because of its size, the materials employed, and t he richness of detail.

The area served as the home to many prominent intellectuals, educators, and entertainer s, as well as civic, civil rights, and religious leaders; it also contains a number of institutional buildings constructed by African -American architects and builders who have made significant contributions to the architectural heritage of the District of Columbia. The buildings in the district record the full development of a Victorian -era streetcar neighborhood from the opening of the first streetcar line in 1862, through its mature development during the last decades of the 19th century and into the ear ly 20th century. The district serves as an excellent illustration of the forces affecting the city's development in this period, including the introduction of building codes, mass production of building elements, and the rise of a local industry of builde rs and real estate developers. These entrepreneurs constructed groups of speculative row houses for a growing middle -class market, most typically in brick with projecting bays and picturesque rooflines.

A 1914 addition and 1923 expansion of the copper -clad conservatory were designed by arch itect Appleton P. Clark. The original carriage house and grounds also remain. At Heurich's insistence, the house was constructed to be fireproof \u2014likely the first such residence in the city \u2014and incorporated many technological advancements like pneumatic a nnunciators, metal speaking tubes, and electric lighting and alarms. The lavish interiors evoke an Old -World pedigree, expressing German culture both in the overall display of fine craftsmanship and most explicitly in the remarkable muraled Alt Deutsche B ierstube (old German beer room) in the basement. Other notable interiors include formal parlors, dining room, music room, library, grand staircase, family quarters, nursery, and servants' quarters. The interior decoration and furnishing was managed by th e New York interior design firm of Charles H. and Hugo F. Huber, and executed by a variety of German -American craftsmen, including Washington cabinetmaker August Grasse, metalworker Amandus Jorss, and painter Detlef Sammann. The house remained in the fami ly until 1956, when it was bequeathed to the Columbia Historical Society (later the Historical Society of Washington, D.C.), which occupied the house until 2002. The family repurchased the house in 2003.

Through Houston's vision, beginning in 1929 Howard Law School became an educational training ground for activist lawyers dedicated to securing the civil rights of all people of color. In 1936, the nation's first legal course in Civil Rights was established there. Howard University also provided critical support to Marshall and the Legal Defense Fund and Educational Fund of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as they developed the legal strategy that culminated in the historic Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education , thus ending segregation in public education. NHL designation January 3, 2001 Founders Library : Completed in 1939, Founders Library was designed in the Colonial Revival style by architects Cassell and Willinston. One of Albert I. Cassell's primary design archi tects, Louis E. Fry, Sr., who had a significant hand in the design of the library, once commented on its resemblance to Philadelphia's Independence Hall, stating since the Library was dedicated to liberty, there was no more appropriate design for Howard U niversity's major building to emulate. Frederick Douglass Memorial Hall : Completed in 1935, this Neoclassical building was also built under the direction of Albert Cassell. It housed classrooms and offices for the Departments of Education, History, and Psychology, as well as the Deans of the College of Liberal Arts and the Graduate School. Andrew Rankin Memorial Chapel : Completed in 1894, the chapel was dedicated to the brother of Jeremiah C. Rankin, president of the university from 1890 -1903. Eclectic and asymmetrical in design, it is set picturesquely into the hillside. It continues to be used for religious activities and as an auditorium. Carnegie Building : Designed by Henry Whitfield and completed in 1 910, this building housed the principal library and School of Religion until 1945. Although not fully documented with respect to NHL criteria, the building is included as a structure that contributes to the setting of the site. The Yard : Howard's upper quadrangle provides the setting for these and five other academic buildings. The Yard became the university's symbolic heart as the campus evolved, and it remains the center of campus life. The design is by landscape a rchitect David A. Willinston.

Its establishment reflects the growth of the Irish immigrant population in the capital, and presages the rapid postwar expansion of the city north of M assachusetts Avenue. The four architecturally related buildings typify the urban Catholic model, with the church as a centerpiece surrounded by buildings for education and religious orders. The group is a fine example of Gothic Revival and related eccles iastical architecture, and is associated with notable pastors including its founder, Rev. J. Walter, who was the confessor and defender of Mary Surratt after Lincoln's assassination.

The design is attributed to Edward Clements, a builder with ties to the prolific Washington architect Adolph Cluss (designer of the contemporaneous and similar Calvary Baptist Church). The major portion of the bric k and cast iron church, including the pressed brick front, was built in 1871 -74, but for lack of funds the tower was not completed until 1904 -05, with exterior work continuing to 1910 and interior finishes to the 1930s. Immaculate Conception Boys' School : Built in 1908 on the site of the original church (dating from 1864 -65), the boys' school is a three -story Tudor Revival building by architect B. Stanley Simmons. The three -bay fa\u00e7ade of red brick with b rownstone trim is dominated by a central entrance and copper oriel between octagonal DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 79 towers, with large banks of classroom windows in the flanking bays. Rectory (1315 8th Street, NW): Built before 1873, the th flat -fronted Italianate rowhouse with pressed brick fa\u00e7ade, bracketed wooden cornices, and iron stoop is typical of the residential building forms of the period. Convent (1317 8th Street, NW): Built between 1874 and 1878, the three -story Italianate/Queen Anne rowhouse is adjacent to the rectory, with a pressed brick fa\u00e7ade and similar cornices, but with a full -height hexagonal bay and more vertical proportions. The convent housed the Sisters of Char ity in charge of the girls' school, Immaculate Conception Academy, which relocated in 1872 to a new building at 8th and Q Streets, after outgrowing its shared quarters in the original church.

Judiciary Square (Original Appropriation No. 9; Reservation 7): see The Plan of the City of Washington . Judiciary Square was originally designated as the site for the Supreme Court, in accordance with L'Enfant's Plan to plac e the three branches of government in a geographical relationship. Although never used for the Supreme Court, the site was gradually developed as a complex of public buildings. It has been the location for a city jail (later converted for hospital use an d used during the Civil War), City Hall, a public school, a library, the Pension Building, and other government buildings. In the mid -19th century, the site became the traditional location of presidential inaugural balls, which were held in temporary buil dings in the square before the construction of the monumental Pension Building provided an ideal permanent location. Although the grounds of the square were enhanced periodically for these events, it was inconsistently maintained until after the Civil War, when improvements included a statue to President Lincoln, grading, drainage, fencing, footpaths, and other landscape elements. Judiciary Square was chosen as the site for the first station in the Metrorail System, and ground was broken for the station i n December 1969. In 1989 -91, a three -acre memorial to honor the nation's law enforcement officers was built in the square. HABS DC -690 The Juniata (Harry Wardman/A.H.

Kameny, one of the leading lights of the gay rights movement, and considered the father of gay activism. Trained as an astronomer, Kameny transformed his personal struggle into a cultural struggle that radicalized the gay rights movement and seized the rhetorical high ground. After being disch arged from the Army Map Service in 1957 for his homosexuality, Kameny waged a four -year legal fight against the notion that sexual orientation would make one unfit or unsuitable for federal service. Although the Supreme Court declined to hear his case, it was the first time that an equal -rights claim had been made on the basis of sexual orientation. In 1961, Kameny co-founded the Mattachine Society of Washington, committed to achieving an equal legal and social footing for homosexuals. The organization f ocused on federal employment discrimination, assisting and counseling those who had been fired or disadvantaged while at the same time crafting the legal basis for overturning federal discrimination on a national level. During the 1970s, the organization compelled government agencies to liberalize their policies by forcing public scrutiny of hiring and security clearance decisions. Kameny also recognized that changing society's image of homosexuals and dispelling common perceptions would help open the doo r to legal equality. Among the obstacles was the stigma of the American Psychiatric Association's definition of homosexuality as a mental illness. After eight years of protest, Kameny and his allies succeeded in persuading the APA to remove homosexuality from its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders. The Mattachine Society also ran a program of outreach to churches. Disdaining any apology for his homosexuality, Kameny coined the slogan Gay is Good , announcing that society would hav e to accept homosexuals on their own terms. Kameny was also prominent in local public service. In 1971, when the District of Columbia gained a non -voting delegate to the House of Representatives, he was the first openly gay person to run for Congress. I n 1975, he became the District's first openly gay official when appointed to the Human Rights Commission. Built 1955 ; period of significance 1962 -1975.

On L'Enfant's plan of 1791, the area across Pennsylvania Avenue north of the White House, including the two flanking squares between 15th and 17th Streets now occupied by buildin gs, were indicated as part of President's Park. For several decades after construction of the White House, the area was used for various temporary functions, and during Thomas DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 85 Jefferson's administration, a section of Pennsylvania Avenue was cleared to s eparate the White House grounds from the people's park. Jackson Place and Madison Place were opened on either side of the park in about 1820, at the time the Decatur, Cutts, and Tayloe houses were built. In 1824, the park was planted and walks were lai d out in anticipation of the visit of the Marquis de Lafayette, and the park was named in his honor. The park was redesigned by Andrew Jackson Downing in 1851 -52. The equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson was erected in the center of the park in 1853, but the installation of Jackson's design was not completed until 1872. The park's two bronze urns, included on the 1852 plans and cast by the Ordnance Department of the Navy Yard from the design of an antique vase, were installed at that time. The tall fence around the park installed under the Downing plan was removed in 1889, and in 1891, the first of the corner statuary groups, honoring Lafayette, was erected at the southeast corner of the park. It was followed by monuments to Rochambeau at the southwest c orner in 1902, and Steuben and Kosciuszko at the northwest and northeast corners respectively, in 1910. In 1914, a small watchman's lodge replaced the original lodge on the H Street side of the park; it is the last remaining of four identical lodges that were also built in Lincoln, Franklin, and Judiciary squares. The park was redesigned by the Works Progress Administration in 1937, and again in 1962 as part of the John Carl Warnecke plan for new government offices flanking the square.

It was sited amidst agricultural buildings, pastures, natural woodlands, and newly introduced picturesque landscape features designed in the manner promoted by the influential aesthete Andrew Jackson Downing ; some of these landscape features remain. Riggs called the house Corn Rigs , and used it as a country retreat, particularly after retiring to private lif e in 1848 after his firm's great success as bankers to the government during the Mexican War; he sold it to the government in 1851. The cottage served as President Lincoln's summer retreat from 1862 to 1864, and in July of 1862, Lincoln wrote his second d raft of the Emancipation Proclamation here. In 1889, the Soldier's Home named it the Anderson Building in honor of Maj.

A plan for the park was first devised in 1855, but the square was little more than a refuse heap until the Civil War, when it became the site of a Union hospital. Congress officially designated the reservation as Lincoln Square in 1866, and the park was enclosed and landscaped between 1872 and 1875. The Emancipation statue was installed in 1876.

Sponsored by a committee of business and civic leaders that formed immediately after the assassination, it was funded by lo cal donations from a citizenry truly shocked by the assassination but also insecure about alleged Southern sympathies. The monument was dedicated with great fanfare on the third anniversary of the assassination, with President Johnson, many dignitaries, a nd a huge crowd in attendance. Flannery, an Irish immigrant and stone carver, ran a successful local business, but his statue raised high in the air on a tall column \u2014in the style of a cemetery monument \u2014was later considered hopelessly na\u00efve.

As a memorial to the nation's first presi dent, it was the first road with a commemorative function explicit in its name DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 102 and alignment. The parkway contributed to the establishment of a regional park system oriented along creek and river valleys, as envisioned in the 1902 McMillan Plan and 1920s NCPC plans. It was an important link in the evolution of parkway design from pioneering efforts in Westchester County to later federal projects such as Skyline Drive. It was also one of the first roads planned using aerial photography, and it established National Park Service standards for future parkway construction. The segment in the District includes Memorial Circle, about 1\u00bd miles of roadway, the Boundary Channel Bridge (stone -faced concrete arch), light fixtures, specimen and ornamental trees, and planned vistas. It was authorized in 1928 and built in 1931 -32 by the Bureau of Public Roads (Gilmore Clarke, consulting landscape architect and bridge designer; Jay Downer, consulting engineer). Monuments along the parkway include the Navy -Marine Memori al (designed 1922, built 1934) by Ernesto Begni del Piatta, in commemoration of those who died at sea during World War I, and the Lyndon Baines Johnson Memorial Grove (1976).

A public market was first erected on the 7th Street side of the square in 1846, but was removed in 1872. In that year the inte rsecting streets and avenues were laid out through the reservation, and the square improved as a group of six triangular parks. After residents petitioned for a single park at the location, the carriageways were removed in 1882, and the park planted with trees and shrubs. In 1899, Andrew Carnegie agreed to donate funds for a public library in the square. The library was completed in 1903, but the site was not redesigned and landscaped until 1913, and that design remains largely intact today. HABS DC -682 Mount Vernon Square Historic District Roughly bounded by 1st Street, New York Avenue, 7th Street, and M and N Streets, NW One of two remaining fragments of a formerly contiguous neighborhood around Mount Vern on Square, this residential and commercial enclave derives its origins from scattered growth on what was once the city's fringe. Many of its oldest buildings are simple, flat -fronted frame houses built by working -class owners. By the Civil War, the area g rew into an economically and racially mixed neighborhood, served by the public market in the square and the streetcar line along 7th Street. Bay -fronted brick and stone rowhouses, and fancy mercantile facades on 7th Street date from the prosperous Victori an years. At the same time, poorer residents continued to cluster in modest homes on the narrow side streets cut through large blocks. Owner -built homes predominate; a notable exception is the full block of 53 houses developed by T.F. Schneider in 1890. By the early 20th century, the character of the neighborhood began to shift as auto repair shops, laundries, and warehouses sprang up along the increasingly busy New York Avenue traffic artery. The district effectively conveys the mosaic of overlapping s ocial, racial, and workplace communities that characterize historic Washington.

This was the first building constructed according to plans developed during the 1920s for a civic center between Judiciary Square and Pennsylvania Avenue. The building was designed by municipal architect Nathan C. Wyeth and constructed from 1939 to 1941. The overall form of the building reflects both its origins in the Beaux Arts civic center form, and the context of Neoclassical buildings on Judiciary Square, but the decorative inspiration is Art Deco and Art Moderne. Notable features in clude the cast aluminum revolving doors and abstracted classical columns, capitals, and moldings. Designed at the close of the New Deal era, the building also incorporates major artwork sponsored by the Works Progress Administration. In the interior cour tyards are two enormous ceramic sculptural panels: Democracy in Action by Waylande Gregory, and Health and Welfare by Hildreth Meiere. Flanking the plaza steps to the west of the building are two granite bas -relief sculptural panels: Urban Life by John Gregory, and Light, Water, and Thoroughfare by Lee Lawrie.

The National Society United States Daughters of 1812 is a volunteer women's service organization dedicated to patriotism, education, and preservation of documents and relics from the period between 1784 and 1815. It was organized on January 8, 1892, on the 77th anniversary of the Battle of N ew Orleans , by founder Flora Adams Darling, an author, Civil War widow, and daughter of John Adams.

One of the world's foremost astronomical institutions, the observatory has established a long -standing and illustrious reputation based on its primary role in precise timekeepi ng and fundamental astronomy, or the calculation of the exact position of celestial bodies. Since 1893, when it relocated from Foggy Bottom, the institution has been located on a hilltop campus north of Georgetown. The ten original buildings that compris ed the observatory complex, all but one of which survive, were designed by the famed American architect Richard Morris Hunt, and are his only buildings in Washington, D.C. The observatory is nationally significant for its architecture and for the importan ce and continuity of its scientific work. The site for the observatory was acquired in 1881, and the complex was begun in 1888 and occupied in 1893. After the initial period of construction, the site developed quite gradually, with small buildings constr ucted as needed to house new instruments or functions. More significant physical changes have occurred during wartime. During World War I, the observatory's longstanding role in the maintenance, repair, and testing of instruments increased dramatically, as many more instruments were needed to equip naval ships and airplanes, and the Navy could no longer rely on European manufacturers for specialized components such as optical glass. The Nautical Instrument Shop, established in 1913, and the Aviation Sect ion, created in 1917, were significant to the war effort, as was the observatory's continuing role in supporting naval navigation and convoy shipping. Modest improvements to the grounds continued during the 1920s and 1930s, and in the early 1930s, the observatory began a modernization program as part of an effort to create a stronger program for abstract scientific investigation. As the observatory's functions expanded again during World War II, a cluster of new buildings was added at the southern edge of the site. During the postwar years, a modern instrument laboratory was built at the western edge of the campus. Buildings subsequent to the original construction were designed by the Navy Bureau of Yards and Docks. NR and NHL eligible; US ownership; se e also Old Naval Observatory, Admiral's House, and Bibliography (Robinson & Associates, Intensive Level Survey) Main Building (Building 1; James Melville Gillis Building): A masterful design by one of the most prominent and influential American architect s of the late 19th century, the Main Building owes its unusual configuration of intersecting shapes to the unique technical and architectural challenges posed by the DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 108 observatory program. The building houses four distinct elements \u2014the elegant marble ashlar administrative wing in the center, flanked by the conical -roofed cylindrical library at one end and the rock -faced marble observatory tower and corrugated metal transit house (Building 8) at the other. The administrative wing provides office space for ad ministrative as well as professional staff performing the critical calculations that make astronomical data usable. The collection of the observatory library is one of the world's foremost astronomical collections, containing both current publications and rare books and periodicals dating back to the 15th century. The domed observatory tower houses the original 12 -inch refracting equatorial telescope, supported on a massive foundation that extends down through the tower to bedrock. Both the observatory a nd the transit house ( see below ) have been significant in conducting the scientific work at the observatory. Designed between 1881 and 1887, the building was constructed in 1891 -92. The spare and abstractly detailed fa\u00e7ades are inspired by eclectic Neocl assicism. Great Equatorial Building (Building 2): Built as part of the original complex to house the 26 -inch telescope still in use, this is one of the most important scientific structures at the observatory. The rock -faced white marble building is comp osed of two interconnected parts, a small temple -like office wing in front of the domed observatory. The dome rotates a full 360 degrees, and the floor of the observatory can be raised or lowered with counterweights. The telescope was the largest in the world when built, and today it is the largest refracting instrument still in use. The lens dates from 1873 and was relocated from the old Foggy Bottom observatory. It has been used for observations of planetary features and moons, binary stars, comets, a steroids, novae, and occultations. Clock House (Building 3) and Observator's Rooms (Buildings 4 and 5): Built from 1888 -93, this attached group at the exact center of the observatory circle determined the plan of the entire complex. The Clock House, a small, gable -roofed granite building in the form of a Greek temple, housed the observatory's original master clock until about 1961. The Zero Mark, a small metal disk, is set into the center of the floor. The master clock, sealed in a vault for protection from external temperature, humidity, and barometric pressures, gave the extremely accurate time calculations that were broadcast daily to navigators, telegraph and telephone systems, and civil authorities. Since the delicate timekeeping instruments neede d maximum protection from external vibrations caused by traffic or construction, an 1894 Act of Congress protected the circular area within 1,000 feet of the house from development. The flanking observator's rooms, connected to the clock house with short hyphens, supported the work of timekeeping and the two transit circle instruments by providing space for astronomers to rest, warm up, and perform calculations at night. The hip -roofed observator's rooms are similar to the clock house, and share a continu ous stone foundation, but are constructed of wood. All three buildings were designed by Richard Morris Hunt as part of the original complex. A new time clock vault, added at the rear of the building in 1932, was part of a general modernization of the obs ervatory. It allowed observation of the time clock through a periscope, avoiding the need to enter the vault. Nine -Inch Transit House (Building 6), North Marker House (Building 29), and South Marker House (Building 30): Built to house the nine -inch tra nsit circle telescope, the transit house was part of the original 1893 complex. It is one of the pair of transit houses located on either side of the Clock House because of their use in timekeeping and sensitivity to vibration and other interference. As originally designed, the transit house was a simple gabled box set on a high stone foundation, with corrugated metal sides and observation openings along the ridge and sides, enclosable with large flaps. Uninsulated metal walls were necessary to ensure ev en interior and exterior temperatures. The original nine -inch transit was one of the most important telescopes in the observatory, used in positional astronomy and in determining the fundamental celestial coordinate system in the early 20th century. In 1 932-33, the roof was replaced with a lower gable that split open transverse to the ridge, by rolling on steel beams supported by external trussed buttresses. The original telescope was decommissioned in 1945 and replaced by a seven -inch transit from 1956 to the late 1960s. The north and south marker houses (circa 1893 -1908) are small, square wooden sheds on brick foundations, placed at a precise distance from the transit house to shelter lights used in calibrating the instrument. Six-Inch Transit House ( Building 7), North Marker House (Building 27), and South Marker House (Building 28): Built to house the six -inch transit telescope, this transit house is the twin of the nine -inch transit DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 109 house. For more than 100 years, the building housed the six -inch t ransit circle telescope, one of the observatory's most important instruments, used in the creation of six fundamental star catalogues since 1924. The telescope was installed in 1898 and decommissioned in the mid -1990s, when the fundamental coordinate system for the northern hemisphere was completed. Like its twin, the transit house was altered in 1932 -33; the north and south marker houses date from 1899 and circa 1900 -08 respectively. Transit House (Building 8): The transit house at the west end of the Main Building was originally similar to the other transit houses, sheathed in corrugated metal with an operable observation slit along the gable. Boiler House (Building 17) and Dynamo House (Building 16): This connected structure includes one -story grani te boiler house with brick smokestack, designed by Richard Morris Hunt as part of the original complex, and a brick dynamo house annex designed by Leon Dessez in 1891. Two floors were added to the dynamo house in 1917, when it was converted to an instrume nt repair shop. The observatory's nautical instrument work was a critical function during wartime. Transit Laboratory (Building 25): This small gabled shed, made of metal with an operable roof, dates from about 1893. Its original use may have been rela ted to the photo house and photoheliograph (now demolished), and it was also used as a portable transit house for longitude calculations. Superintendent's Residence (Quarters A): see separate listing for Admiral's House Observers' Houses (Quarters B and C): Built in 1895 -96, this duplex residence is one of the earliest buildings on the site, designed by noted Washington architect Will1am J. Marsh. Astronomer's residences, of which Quarters B and C are the best examples on the site, were crucial to the efficiency and productivity of the observatory, as proximity to the telescopes allowed astronomers to work at night whenever viewing conditions were optimal. Foreman's House (Quarters D): Built in 1901, this American foursquare residence (with recent add itions) was erected to house the foreman and captain of the watch. Non-Magnetic House (originally Building 42, now Building 54): Built in 1918 in response to a shortage of magnetic compasses during the war, this small square wooden building with overhang ing flared eaves was constructed without any iron or steel in order to allow for compass work. It was later converted to house clock vaults. Astrographic Laboratory (Building 24) and Addition (now Building 78; Simon Newcomb Laboratory): Built in 1932, t he astrographic laboratory was one of three major scientific buildings constructed as part of the modernization effort in the early 1930s. It housed laboratory space, offices, and dark rooms for developing photographs. A large 1961 addition, the only maj or postwar building on the campus, houses the Time Service Division, Astrometry and Astrophysics Division, and Horological Museum. Atomic and quartz -crystal clocks used in modern timekeeping are housed here, as is the current Master Clock calibrated to an accuracy of one billionth of a second per day from instruments at various locations on the grounds. Forty -Inch Telescope Dome (Building 39): Built in 1932, this structure housed the forty -inch Ritchey - Chr\u00e9tien aplanatic reflecting telescope, one of the first of its kind and one of the largest telescopes in the country when installed. The building is hexagonal in plan, sheathed in corrugated metal, with a rotating observation dome. The original telescope was relocated to Arizona in 1955. Instrument Rep air and Storage Building (Building 52): This concrete industrial building from 1940 -41 was a significant component of the World War II -era expansion of the observatory facilities, accommodating a more than 10 -fold increase in employment in the Material De partment. The building housed the observatory's nautical instrument repair, calibration, maintenance, and dissemination, which was critical to the war effort. DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 110 Mess Hall (Building 59): This one -story brick building was constructed as a cafeteria in 1942, in conjunction with the vast increase in the observatory's work in supplying navigational instruments during World War II. It was an important support building associated with the wartime mobilization. The International style design features overhanging roofs, wraparound casement windows, and a recessed corner entrance flanked by circular windows. Training Compass House (Building 55): Built in 1943 as a twin to the 1918 non -magnetic house, this structure was apparently built for the same reason \u2014increas ed compass demand during wartime. It was also used subsequently for clock vaults. Compass Adjustor's House (Building 61): This small rectangular hip -roofed wooden cottage on a brick foundation was built in 1943 for compass work. Simon Newcomb Laborator y (Building 78): The two -story 1961 addition to the Astrographic Laboratory is the only major postwar building on the campus. It is flat -roofed with an observation dome; facades are precast paneled concrete, with abstract pilasters and trim reflecting to the design of the 1932 laboratory. The combined structure houses the Time Service Division, Astrometry and Astrophysics Division, and Horological Museum. Atomic and quartz -crystal clocks used in modern timekeeping are housed here, as is the current Mast er Clock calibrated to an accuracy of one billionth of a second per day from instruments at various locations on the grounds.

Navy Yard Car Barn (Washington & Georgetown Railroad Car House) 770 M St reet, SE This imposing brick and stone streetcar barn was constructed in 1891 at a terminus of the city's first and perhaps most important streetcar line, running along Pennsylvania Avenue from Georgetown to the Navy Yard. The sprawling Romanesque Revival building is well known for its picturesque castellated corner, standing just opposite the Yard's Main Gate. It is the only Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company building to survive from the cable car era, and one of the city's few surviving streetca r facilities. The car barn is a reminder of Navy Yard's importance as a place of local employment, and of the streetcar system that lasted for 100 years and had a profound influence on the city's development.

For many years the Newton has been a social and physical center of Brookland, and its fortunes have often mirrored those of the surrounding community. The Newton's opening was a boon to the 12th Street commercial district, but such new theaters ultimately suffered from increasing competition themselves, not only from other venues, but from other media such as television. Theaters' troubles were aggravat ed by the flight of both population and capital from urban neighborhoods, and in a climate of dropping demand, desegregation contributed to making redundant theaters unsustainable. The Newton closed in the mid 1960s, and its vacancy became not only a symb ol but a cause of the neighborhood's flagging health. The Newton was designed by prominent theater architect John J. Zink, who is credited with more than 200 movie theater projects in this region. With its glazed yellow brick, streamlined corner portal, and ziggurat sign, the building is a good example of an Art Moderne/Art Deco -style neighborhood theater, one of only a handful left in the city.

Civic improvement of the area on a grand scale began as early as 1891, with the construction of the Corcoran Gallery of Art. A decade later, the Senate Park Commission Plan encompassed the area within the kite -shaped General Plan for Central Washington, but aside from a group of civic buildings on the west side of the Ell ipse, and a new avenue leading to the Lincoln Memorial site, it envisioned mostly a buffer of parkland. Soon thereafter, the western frame of the Ellipse was in place, with construction of the Pan American Union (1908 -10), D.A.R. Headquarters (1910), and Red Cross (1915). The same pattern continued westward in the 1920s, as the National Academy of Sciences (1922 -24) rose across the park from the Lincoln Memorial. The federal presence in the area was heralded by the construction of the Interior Department Offices in 1915 - 17, as well as wartime tempos for the cabinet departments housed in the State, War, and Navy Building nearby. Sustained demand for expansion of government offices led to more formalized planning of the northwest triangle or northwest building area as a counterpart to the Federal Triangle complex across the Ellipse. By 1931, the National Capital Planning Commission officially recommended the design of a unified complex of federal buildings, and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., prepared in itial layouts for the grouping that would become known as the Northwest Rectangle. A series of plans evolved through the 1930s, as new buildings were constructed for the Public Health Service (1933), Department of the Interior (1935 -36), Federal Reserve ( 1937), and War Department (1939 -41). Intermittent ideas for a functionally consolidated public health or defense center, organized around a central square or Little Mall were considered, but none was fully realized. After the Second World War, major co nstruction continued with the Pan American Union Annex (1949), Red Cross D.C. Chapter House (1950 -52), State Department (1957 -60) and Office of Personnel Management (1963). Though architecturally diverse, the district is unified by buildings of monumental scale, imposing presence, and similarity of design inspiration and materials. It includes 17 contributing buildings dating from 1891 to 1963. Nearly all are constructed of limestone or marble with facades that show a gradual evolution over the years fro m classicism to modernism.

It was begun in 1820, after designs by architect George Hadfield, but construction proceeded fitfully because of chronic underfunding of the local government. Unlike the major federal buildings, which were built of stone, City Hall was constructed economically of brick with a stucco facing. By 1822, the central section was complete, and occupied by the mayor and reg istrar. The east wing was completed in 1826, but the west wing not until 1849 -50. During the period before the Civil War, trials of abolitionists and Underground Railroad participants occurred here. In 1863, the District's newly formed Supreme Court too k up residence in the building. Ten years later, it expanded to occupy the entire structure as Congress assumed control. From 1881 - 83, the building was enlarged on its north side, and in 1892, a brick ventilating tower similar to those on the Capitol gro unds was added just to the west of the building. Architect of the Capitol Edward Clark oversaw both projects. By the early 20th century, the stucco facades had deteriorated to such an extent that in 1916 -18, the entire building was refaced in limestone, and the interior was substantially rebuilt with new courtrooms. While the new facades followed the original design closely, some changes were made including removal of the 1883 north portico. Architect of the Capitol Eliott Woods was responsible for the work.

Because the firehouse served a suburban area generally beyond the city's hydrant system, it received a chemical engine and was originally known as Chemical Company No. 3. The building was designed by A.B. Mullett & Sons, th e firm led by the sons, Thomas and Frederick, of the deceased former Supervising Architect of the Treasury. It is the most domestic of the city's firehouse designs, essentially a half -timbered , sixteenth -century English manor house , with modifications to accommodate fire equipment. The building was renamed Engine Company 26 at the beginning of the automobile era. In 1940, however, Engine 26 moved out when a restructuring of the fire department led to disposal of redundant stations.

Built in 1906 -07, the project was her first successful enticement of a foreign mission to Sixteenth Street, in k eeping with her great ambition to create an \"Avenue of Presidents\" lined with lavish embassies and memorials. It is a superb example of Beaux -Arts residential architecture, ranking among Totten's finest work. The embassy was planned and built under Frenc h ambassador Jean Jules Jusserand, who served from 1902 -25 as one of the most influential and admired foreign diplomats ever assigned to the Washington corps. It was the site of critical political conferences during and after World War I, and served as Ju sserand's residence until his retirement.

The observatory was the site of notable advances in astronomy and mathematics, and is associated with its first superintendent, Matthew Fontaine Maury, who supervised the publication of numerou s volumes of oceanographical charts, and was the author of the first oceanographical textbook. The observatory installed a new transit circle instrument by the end of the Civil War. The domed south wing housed the 26 -inch Great Equatorial telescope, the l argest of its day, installed in 1873. In 1877, astronomer Asaph Hall discovered the moons of Mars with this instrument. From its inception, the observatory was authorized to calculate and keep official time, which was indicated by the dropping of a time DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 116 ball from the flagstaff each day at noon. By 1878, poor atmospheric conditions in Foggy Bottom led Congress to authorize relocation to a new site, and in 1893, the observatory moved to its new home on Massachusetts Avenue extended. After its relocation, the property was transferred to the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery to serve as a Museum of Hygiene, and later the Naval Medical School.

With the new convenience of public transit uptown, these buildings created the city's first apartment corridor. Stylistically, the Ol ympia is also notable as a transitional mixture of Victorian and Beaux Arts design, reflecting the period from about 1895 to 1905 when monumental classicism returned to favor in Washington. In architect Albert B. Morgan's design, the stark verticality of hexagonal bays contrasts with the tripartite horizontal layering and design motifs of a classical fa\u00e7ade.

A notable work of the German -American architect Albert Goenner, the building is located in the midst of the down town mercantile neighborhood historically dominated by German -American businesses. OBA exemplifies the historical importance of immigrant self -help organizations and business relationships. Chartered in 1880, the association DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 117 originated in 1861 as a build ing and loan association designed to allow small businesses and average savers to pool resources and offer credit. The association's name suggests that the founders may have been members of a fraternal lodge: at the time of its founding, there was an Or iental Lodge No. 19 of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows downtown and a Masonic Oriental Lodge in Alexandria. For many years, the officers and directors of the Association were German immigrants; Goenner's selection as architect undoubtedly reflects h is connections within that community. The association occupied its building at 6th and F Streets for nearly a century, and continues in business today as OBA Bank, the oldest savings and loan in the nation.

The simple granite shaft commemorates the original eighteen landholders whose land grants embraced the site of the federal city. Each side of the monument contains a relief panel carved with a symbol of the early pioneers' agricultural pursuits \u2014a tobacco plan t, wild turkey, stalk of corn, and fish. The names of the original landowners are inscribed on the base with the dates of their land patents. Orme Bui lding: see The -28 and 1330 -32 U Street, NW These twin apartment houses are notable among Washington's early multiple -family dwellings. Built soon after the 1896 opening of an electrified streetcar line on U Street, the Oswego (built 1900) and the Exeter (built 1904 ), reflect the changing nature of housing in an increasingly urbanized city. This type of moderately priced and attractively designed apartment house, conveniently located in an established neighborhood, helped to popularize apartment living for Washingto n's middle class. The buildings demonstrate an early use of the same design for twin buildings, which was to become a much -used technique for architects and developers in providing economical apartment housing. The buildings are the earliest extant apart ment commission (at age 29) of architect B.

Each is three stories, T -shaped in plan with facades of tan brick atop a limestone base, with stone lintels, and sheet metal pediments and cornices; facades mix late Victorian and early Colonial Revival elements, including bay -like center pavilions with attenuated pilasters and pedimented door surrounds.

Built as a rural country house for journalist William L. Crounse, Owl's Nest and its exceptional wooded grounds illustrate the gradual transition of the form er Washington County from farmsteads to scattered suburban country houses on large lots, to more dense suburbs on a planned system of gridded streets. Designed by Appleton P. Clark, Jr., a significant native architect, it is one of the city's best example s of this style, exhibiting the complex asymmetrical massing, wide sheltering roofs, massive stone walls, and contrasting wood -shingled surfaces that characterize the style.

Parkways in the Washington area are the culmination of efforts of District, Maryland, and Virginia inte rests, guided by the McMillan Commission's recommendation for a series of parks and parkways extending the scheme of Pierre L'Enfant. After the precedent -setting network of suburban New York parkways, upon which it was idealized, Washington's system is th e most comprehensive and monumental in the nation. Recreational use of automobiles prevailed during their earliest decades. In keeping with the McMillan Plan, a token carriage path around the Tidal Basin and upriver to Rock Creek was built by 1904, ser ving as a literal and figurative prologue to the era of parkway construction. The city trailed behind others, however, in the development of parkways, and it was not until the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933 that parkway landscaping was provided for at the federal level. The parkway's foremost purpose was to separate pleasure motorists from the traffic of heavy commercial users. DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 120 Initially, the parkway was conceived simply as an attenuated park with a road through it. By 1938, however, the Nat ional Park Service had identified a set of eight characteristics to differentiate parkways from ordinary highways. These specifications were: a limit to non -commercial, recreational traffic; the avoidance of unsightly roadside development; a wider -than-average right -of-way to provide a buffer from abutting property; no frontage or access rights, to encourage the preservation of natural scenery; preference for a new site, to avoid already congested and built -up areas; best access to native scenery; the eli mination of major grade crossings; and well -distanced entrance and exit points to reduce traffic interruptions and increase safety. Collectively, these specifications ensured a self -contained, well -preserved, and safe thoroughfare. By the late 1930s, as automobile use shifted from pastime to a more direct transportation purpose, the emphasis in road design also changed. Technological improvements also affected the evolution of parkways until World War II, when parkway development was, for all practical p urposes, usurped by modern highway construction. Ancillary to the major Washington parkways along the Potomac and Rock Creek are a number of related strip or border parks. The land along these small waterways was preserved not just for parkway use, b ut also for flood control. Along Rock Creek, these stream parks include the Piney Branch Parkway (1908 and 1920s), Melvin Hazen Park (along Tilden Street west of the park), Pinehurst Parkway (along Beech Street west of the park), Beach Parkway (at the nor thernmost of the District boundary), and the nearby North Portal Parkway (west of 16th Street). Fragments of a minor park and parkway system that failed to materialize west of Rock Creek include Whitehaven Parkway, Normanstone Parkway, and the Klingle Val ley Parkway. Only a few disjointed border fragments exist of a planned Archbold -Glover Parkway. Further west, Arizona Parkway was intended but never built as a connector to Dalecarlia Parkway. South of the Anacostia, Oxon Run was slated in the 1920s to be developed as a parkway with recreational facilities, but only the latter were built. Some major elements of Washington's idealized parkway system never came to fruition. Fort Drive, a proposed connection of forty or so Civil War fortifications, would have encircled the city, but only portions of the land were acquired. Two extensions of the George Washington Memorial Parkway, both north and south of the city, would have served as ceremonial entries. Despite their absence, the completed system of park ways remains a vital component of the regional transportation system, and contributes to the historic symbolism and design of the nation's capital. Patent Office (National Portrait Gallery and National Museum of American Art) 7th, 9th, F & G Streets, NW One of the finest and most important Greek Revival structures in the nation, the Patent Office is the largest such edifice undertaken b y the U.S. government. Although its origins reflect the confused rivalry that characterized the American architectural profession in the early 19th century, the building nevertheless achieved a unity of design and a simple, bold monumentality unsurpassed in American civil architecture. The building also reflects the historic importance of the Patent Office during the era when scientific invention propelled the American economy and began to mold the national character. Although more than a half million pa tents were issued here, the building was designed not just to house patent examiners, but also to display the models required for patent applications. Throughout the 19th century, it was an important public attraction, exhibiting the Declaration of Indepe ndence, art collections of the National Institute, and other historical artifacts as well. The building served as a temporary barracks and hospital during the Civil War; Walt Whitman's nursing here gave inspiration to his poetry. It was also the site of Lincoln's second inaugural ball. A century later, the building's rescue contributed significantly to the development of the historic preservation movement and the assumption of federal responsibility for stewardship of historic landmarks. GSA contemplate d demolition of the building for a parking garage in the late 1950s, but President Eisenhower intervened, and in 1962, Congress turned the building over to the Smithsonian for museum use. It was renovated in 1964 -67 and reopened to the public in 1968. The Patent Office was built on the site proposed by L'Enfant for a non -denomination national church, affording scientific invention a suitable place of honor in the capital. At the direction of Congress, Andrew Jackson adopted the design submitted by Willia m Parker Elliott, a young Washington architect trained by George DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 121 Hadfield, and Ithiel Town, the former partner of Alexander Jackson Davis, for a quadrangular building to be erected in phases. At the same time, the president placed Robert Mills \u2014whose plan for the Treasury was adopted at the same time \u2014in charge of construction, with authority to make changes in Elliott's plans. Jackson laid the cornerstone of the south wing in 1836. Mills's design modifications included the massive masonry vaults added as a fireproofing measure, the elegant cantilevered double stair opposite the main entrance, and probably the massive Doric portico. The south wing was completed about 1840, and in 1849, Mills was named architect of the east and west wings contemplated in th e original plan. He was removed from his post during construction in 1852, and supervision of the work, including design of the north wing, was turned over to Thomas U. Walter. As in other buildings, Walter dispensed with Mills's stone vaults in favor of shallow segmental brick vaults supported on cast iron beams, and an iron -trussed roof. Walter completed the east wing in 1853, and continued the west wing from 1851 to 1854. His assistant Edward Clark finished the work on the west wing by 1856, and bega n the north wing in the same year. The building was finally completed in 1867, but a devastating fire in 1877 destroyed the iron roofs and upper halls of the west and north wings, while sparing the masonry south and east wings. Architects Cluss & Schulze rebuilt the damaged model hall interiors (and the south hall) in a modern Renaissance style, with richly ornamented cast iron galleries and a patterned encaustic tile floor. On each front, a central Doric portico set in front of facades articulated by continuous monumental pilasters and end pavilions. The natural Aquia Creek sandstone is visible on the south fa\u00e7ade; other facades are white marble above a grey granite base. Major interior features include Mills's Lincoln Gallery on the top floor of the east wing, and the south and west model halls by Cluss & Schulze, with cast relief panels by sculptor Caspar Buberl.

The group of four buildings were developed in 1921 by Allan E. Walker, after designs by architect Robert F. Beresford. They were inspired by the Londonese type of apartments made famous in a play about P omander Walk, a pedestrian street of rowhouses in a London suburb, also then being copied in New York . Traditional humanistic touches, combined with the orientation of the narrow ends of the buildings to Webster Street, rendered the buildings house -like in appearance, pleasing and respectable to residents and passersby alike. Architecturally, the buildings are relatively simple, but reflect the eclectic revivalism of the day. They are brick with occasional projecting hexagonal bays and dormered, hipped roofs with broad eaves and exposed rafter ends, multi -light windows, and arched entrance surrounds. The concept of garden apartments derived from the Garden City movement and other efforts at housing reform. Once popularized, they became nearly ubiquitous for decades of multi -family housing construct ion, and notably for public housing.

It defines the physical character of the national capital, through a symbolic and commemorative arrangement of buildings, structures, and views. The plan was intimately related to the establishment of the United States and the creation of a symbolic and innovative capital city for the Federal republic. It was embellished through 19th century public works and bui lding regulations, and magnified and expanded through the urban improvements of the Senate Park Commission of 1901 (the McMillan Commission), resulting in the most elegant example of City Beautiful tenets in the nation. The plan is the acknowledged master piece of architect -engineer Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant and the McMillan Commission. It is also significant to the work of numerous other persons and groups important to the landscape architecture, urban design, civil engineering, and planning of the city. It has served continuously as the setting for national political expression and nationally significant events, and has influenced subsequent American city planning and other planned national capitals.

Most of these remain recognizable as public open spaces, although some were never developed as public space, and some are the sites of major public buildings with only residual grounds. Original Appropriation No. 6, intended as the location of a ma rket, was never developed, and is now the site of the Federal Reserve. Appropriation No. 7, also intended as a market space, is now occupied by the National Archives. Appropriation No. 8, intended as the site for a non -denominational national memorial ch urch, is the site of the Old Patent Office. Appropriations Nos. 10, 11, and 12, collectively Bank and Exchange Squares, located north of Pennsylvania Avenue between Second and Fourth -and-a-Half Streets, were sold for private development by an Act of Congr ess in 1822, and the sites are now occupied by the U.S. Court House and Department of Labor. See separate entries for the remaining original appropriations: President's Park (No. 1), White House Grounds (part of No. 1), the Ellipse (part of No. 1), Laf ayette Square (part of No. 1), the Capitol Grounds (part of No. 2), the Mall (part of No. 2), Washington Monument Grounds (No. 3), Observatory Hill (No. 4), Washington Arsenal (No. 5), Judiciary Square (No. 9), Hospital Square (No. 13), Washington Navy Yar d (No. 14), Old Eastern Market Square (Nos. 15 and 16) With the outbreak of war between the Union and the Confederacy, many of the city's public grounds became vital to the survival of the city and the Union. Open spaces became ideal campsites for troops protecting the capital, and crude encampments, barracks, temporary offices, and hospitals were erected on them. What little planting and landscaping had been completed before the war was damaged or neglected. Roads, bridges, and the city streets were al so vital to the war effort, and suffered under the abuse. To expedite traffic on Pennsylvania Avenue, Congress chartered the Washington and Georgetown Railroad Company to run streetcar tracks from Georgetown to the Capitol and Navy Yard on the same gauge as the railroad. Following the war, Congress and the city returned their attention to improving and beautifying the city's infrastructure. Jurisdiction of the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds was transferred from civilian control DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 125 to the Army Corp s of Engineers in 1867. Brigadier General Nathaniel Michler (1827 -81) was placed in charge, and although Michler's reports never mentioned L'Enfant by name, his respect for the integrity of the original plan is evident. Michler advocated landscaping the wide avenues as elegant boulevards after the fashion set in Europe. While devising a scheme for the improvement for the avenues, Michler acknowledged parks and small reservations created by the road system as an integral feature of the original plan. He also recognized that the original plan had been misinterpreted when the Mall was divided into segments by intervening streets, and recommended that these streets be tunneled under the Mall. He also suggested, in 1870, that the Potomac flats should be recl aimed. Michler recommended the creation of rectangular parks at McPherson and Farragut Squares, the creation of the circular parks at Thomas, Scott, and Dupont Circles, and the development of parks in the hitherto neglected public reservations east of the Capitol. Congress further committed to improving the Capitol with two important laws in 1870 and 1871. In 1870, Congress formed the Parking Commission and allowed private encroachment on many of L'Enfant's wide streets and avenues under a system that re mains in effect today. The legislation enabled a large percentage of the right -of-way to be maintained and improved by the owners or occupants of the abutting properties, effectively narrowing the width of the street area requiring federally funded improv ement. In 1871, Congress formed a Territorial Government for the city, and during the next four years, under Henry D. Cooke as territorial governor and Alexander Shepherd as head of the Board of Public Works, the city undertook an extraordinary program of public works before it was dissolved due to debt and shame. Nonetheless, Shepherd's improvements drastically changed the face and reputation of the city and inspired decades of growth, investment, and improvement. With the demise of the territorial gove rnment and the Board of Public Works in 1874, responsibility for the streets, bridges, and other public works reverted to a temporary Board of Commissioners until a more permanent municipal government was established by the Organic Act of June 11, 1878. T he Organic Act vested executive power in three Commissioners, including an officer of the Army Corps of Engineers, known as the Engineer Commissioner, who was placed in charge of the repair and improvement of streets, avenues, and other public rights of wa y. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s, the Commissioners and Army Corps continued to improve the city's infrastructure. By 1881, most of the avenues had some type of pavement, and within the next decade, most streets in the northwest quadrant were paved with asphalt as far north as Florida Avenue. By the end of the century, development gradually approached the outer limits of the L'Enfant Plan. The federal Office of Public Buildings and Grounds was responsible for the executive mansion grounds as well as the city's parks and bridges. As the larger city parks were improved, the OPB&G heeded L'Enfant's recommendation for making them the locations of statues and memorials. Parks were further embellished with exotic flowers, trees, and shrubs, although the l ush plantings of the Victorian era gave way to sparser plantings toward the turn of the century. Another responsibility of the OPB&G was to identify and maintain the small, usually triangular federal reservations that resulted from the layout of new roadw ays and landscaped parking areas within the broad street rights -of-way. Scores of these plots were created where the diagonal avenues intersected grid streets; an 1883 listing described 246 federal reservations of various sizes, shapes, and states of improvement. Comprising a total of 408 acres, 38 were described as highly improved, 47 were partially improved, and the remaining 161 were vacant and unimproved. This list was updated in 1887 and 1894, when 301 reservations were enumerated, 92 of which wer e highly improved, 41 partially improved, and 168 unimproved. While few of the triangular reservations were large enough for extensive landscaping, they were laid out with simple lawns or planting beds, often with perimeter iron fencing. The turn of the century and the centennial of the city of Washington provided the occasion for a reexamination of Washington's original plan, subsequent development, and anticipated growth. The result of this process of reevaluation was the 1902 report of the Senate Park Commission, which came to be known as the McMillan Plan. Adopting as their goal the fulfillment of what they called the comprehensive, intelligent, and yet simple and straightforward scheme devised by L'Enfant, the highly accomplished members of the co mmission DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 126 devised a plan that refashioned L'Enfant's Baroque design principles into a powerful statement of City Beautiful aesthetic ideals. The members of the Senate Park Commission created an ambitious set of written and visual proposals for the city's f uture that not only guided Washington's development for decades to come but became a nationally significant model for the new field of city planning nationwide.

It is associated with the first Naval Observatory and a series of U.S. Naval medical institutions, which constituted a sophisticated and inf luential medical facility renowned for the treatment and care of Navy personnel, research into naval medical issues, and the training of naval medical personnel. The institutions' work in these areas improved medical practices and care not only within the Navy, but also in the medical field in general, particularly through advances in areas such as tropical medicine, chemical warfare, aviation medicine, venereal disease, and other contagious diseases. The medical complex had an important association with World War I, treating thousands of servicemen during this period. The war quadrupled the hospital's annual patient load, requiring the construction of additional facilities to handle the increased number of patients and staff. In addition, the Medical Sc hool was affected, entering important new fields of medical training and research relevant to the war effort. Among the school's endeavors during this period was the training of the epidemiological and sanitary units deployed to the front. The Potomac An nex site was set aside as Original Appropriation No. 4 in the Plan of the City of Washington. Although L'Enfant anticipated use of the site for defensive battlements, the District Commissioners set it aside for a National University which never materializ ed. In 1842, President Tyler selected the site as the permanent home of the Depot of Charts and Instruments (established 1830), and authorized the construction of a naval observatory to make the astronomical observations essential for navigation. The obs ervatory occupied the site until 1893, and after its relocation, the property was transferred to the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery to serve as a Museum of Hygiene. The bureau and its laboratories were recognized as the site of significant research in medical issues related to naval service. In 1902, the Naval Medical School established in Brooklyn in 1893 was also relocated to the site. It shared the old observatory, and upon disbanding of the museum in 1905, expanded to occupy the entire structu re. In 1903, Congress authorized construction of a Washington Naval Hospital at the site, to replace the old Naval Hospital near the Navy Yard. The new hospital was built just south of the observatory, followed by separate wards and staff quarters, desig ned in a similar style to create a unified campus. The hospital was used heavily during World War I and the influenza epidemic of 1918. A dental school was established in 1923, and a program in aviation medicine in 1927. By 1930, the facility had become inadequate, and the Navy proposed replacement of all buildings with a new hospital, but in 1937 Congress authorized relocation to a new site. The hospital moved to Bethesda in 1942, and the complex became the administrative headquarters of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.

The campus was established in 1901, when five acres of Original Appropriation No. 4 were separated and transferred to the Marine Hospital Service for use as its Hygienic Laboratory. Created in 1871 as a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, the Marine Hospital Service was the successor to the loose system of marine hospitals built to provide relief and maintenance of disabled seamen at sea and river ports across the country. These hospitals were supported by payments from merchant seamen into the Marine -Hospital Fund, established in 1798 as the nation's first medical insurance program. Under first Supervising Surgeon General Dr. John Maynard DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 130 Woodworth, a former Union Army surgeon, the service was transformed along military lines into a unified national health corps designed to deal with the health needs of a rapidly growing and industrializing nation. In response epidemics of contagious disease, the service's functions were periodically expanded to include the supervision of national quarantine, medical inspection of immigrants, interstate disease prevention, American Indian health systems, and general public health investigat ion. In 1887, the service established a Hygienic Laboratory at its marine hospital on Staten Island, to help diagnose infectious diseases among immigrants. In 1902, the functions of that laboratory were greatly enlarged and relocated to Washington as par t of the reorganized Public Health and Marine Hospital Service, under the direction of the Surgeon General. In 1912, this agency became the Public Health Service, with additional authority to investigate diseases and sanitation. In 1930, the Hygienic Lab oratory was reorganized as the National Institute of Health (with 1948 expansion, National Institutes of Health), and in 1939, the Public Health Service was combined with other New Deal agencies related to health, education, and welfare to create the Feder al Security Agency. In 1953, the agency was elevated to cabinet status as the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and in 1979, remained with the new Department of Health and Human Services. Hygienic Laboratory (Central Building) : Built in 1904 at what was the corner of 25th and E Streets, the main building was occupied by the Hygienic Laboratory (later National Institute of Health) from 1904 to 1941.

The public school system dates from 1804, only four years after the Federal government occupied the city. President Jefferson headed the first board of trustees. Since then, the school system grew as the city developed, and in the process the educational of ferings expanded to address the diverse needs of the city's population. Despite the high level of interest in the public schools, the early school system remained small and housed in makeshift quarters. As late as 1855, the school buildings were describe d as ill -adapted for educational purposes and deficient in space. For African -American children, conditions were worse. The black schools developed in 1807 under the sponsorship of private citizens and religious groups. The schools were quartered in chu rches and in other buildings that had been built for non -educational purposes. Small one -room and two -room frame buildings were constructed along the major roads that cut through the rural landscape of Washington County. Typically, an acre or half -acre o f land was considered sufficient for each school. By the end of the Civil War, however, the District embarked on an ambitious plan to erect modern schoolhouses and a system of free public education that would be unsurpassed in the nation. The postwar era was marked by the construction of a distinctive group of major school buildings, unlike anything that had been built previously in Washington. This new physical presence was accompanied by the restructuring of the schools to create a graded system, high schools, and a normal school. During this period, the school system inaugurated a policy of relatively small buildings for the lower grades, reflecting the modest and widely scattered population of the DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 131 District. Even as the population became more dense, the small elementary school was entrenched in the sympathies of the local citizenry, and this policy endured. In 1862, Congress had provided for a system of public schools for black students, under a separate superintendent, but it was not until 1865 that the first public schoolhouse for African -American students was constructed. By 1874, the separate school systems were merged into a single entity for all of the schools of Washington City, Georgetown, and Washington County. The city gradually overcome t he challenges of a rapidly increasing population and unreliable Congressional funding to construct substantial systems for both white and black schools, although the allocation of funds between the white and black schools remained a serious point of conten tion that affected location, design, and operations of the schools. A limited form of separation of the sexes also endured well into the 20th century, and its vestiges can be seen in separate boys' and girls' entrances in many school buildings Under the commission system of municipal government established in 1878, the public school building program of the last quarter of the nineteenth century was not as publicized as that of the previous decade, although the District continued to seek out innovative des igns for its schools. In 1879, the Commissioners advertised for designs for a public schoolhouse, but throughout the 1880s and much of the 1890s, the Engineer Commissioner and his staff in the Office of the Building Inspector designed dozens of eight - to twelve -room red brick schoolhouses close to population centers. When a school became overcrowded, the customary response was to construct a new school building on an adjacent lot or within a few blocks of the older school. In other instances, small annex es were appended to the original buildings. During the 1880s, architect John B. Brady designed many of the school buildings under the supervision of Building Inspector Thomas B. Entwistle. Architect of the Capitol Edward Clark was also associated with municipal architecture both as a designer and as an inspector of designs. Many of the schools produced during this period were simple, efficient, and durable red brick buildings in the Romanesque Revival style. The buildings were often elaborated with pi cturesque elements, such as towers with pyramidal roofs and finials, and when completed, they blended in with the buildings of the surrounding community. The floor plan typically followed a fairly predictable pattern of four rooms with adjoining cloakroom s on each floor, arranged in a pinwheel fashion around a central hallway, with play areas in the basement. By the late 1890s, the familiar red brick schoolhouse came to characterize the building type in the city. Its straightforward simplicity, once laud ed for its excellence, had become out of step with changing aesthetic standards. In response to this criticism, city and school officials sought ways to improve the quality of design, and following the example of the federal government, opened the design of school buildings to private architects under the supervision of the Building Inspector. While the plans for these newer buildings were basically the same, the exterior treatments of the buildings differed significantly from the previous schools. Thus these early buildings designed by private architects can be regarded as transitional buildings, bridging two eras of schoolhouse design. In the early 20th century, Washington's public educational system began to address a broader range of education needs, such as technical education, physical education, and life -time skills. During the first decade of the century, architects in private practice cooperated with municipal architects in designing facilities to serve these programs. The well -known practition ers involved in this work included Marsh & Peter, Appleton P. Clark, Jr., Leon Dessez, Robert Stead, Waddy B. Wood, and Glenn Brown. The school buildings designed during this period reflected national advances in educational planning and in the technolo gy of ventilation, heating, and lighting. No longer containing only classrooms, auditoria, and playrooms, high schools were now temples of education that included large gymnasia, swimming pools, lunchrooms, laboratories, and armories. Their design had become a science, involving consideration of the building plan, site, relationship to sun, entrances, cloakrooms, playgrounds, and sanitary facilities. Such schools became an important building type discussed in architectural journals. DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 132 In 1908, the Commi ssioners appointed a Schoolhouse Commission to study the buildings of the system. In the area of new building design, the Schoolhouse Commission envisioned the consolidation of small facilities into much larger ones, so that smaller 4 - to 8-room schools w ould be replaced by larger 16 - to 24 -room schools similar to those found in New York City, St. Louis, and Philadelphia. This recommendation proved unpopular, however, and despite the 12 -room elementary school becoming more common, continued increases in s chool enrollment precluded attempts to abandon all older buildings. In 1909, Congress created the position of Municipal Architect, with authority for the design of the public schools, and in 1910, the design of the buildings came under the review of the n ewly created Commission of Fine Arts. During the following two decades, the design of the city's schools was dominated by the two Municipal Architects: Snowden Ashford, who served until 1921, and his successor, Albert L. Harris, who served until his deat h in 1933. During this period, the design of buildings covered the range of Renaissance, Elizabethan, Collegiate Gothic, and Colonial Revival styles, although the preference of the Fine Arts Commissioners tended to favor the latter. After World War I, th e school construction program accelerated rapidly in response to the city's greatly increased population. The creation of junior high schools necessitated a new kind of building, and caused changes in the design of elementary and senior high schools. The city's architects also experimented with expansible buildings, allowing schools to be designed as a complete whole, but constructed in sections as the population of the surrounding community expanded. By the end of the decade, the city embarked on a Five Year Building Program to provide larger and more modern schools, and as part of the plan, Municipal Architect Harris finally abandoned the old eight -room pinwheel -type of building in favor of schools with 16 to 20 classrooms. During the 1930s, the Great Depression interrupted the Five Year Building Program embarked upon in the late 1920s. Funds for school construction were not readily available, yet at the same time, the New Deal programs of the Roosevelt Administration brought large numbers of workers t o the District. Overcrowding continued to be a problem in the schools. In spite of these problems, 27 new schools were completed during the 1930s, including four high schools and seven junior high schools. Vocational schools were raised to the level of junior high schools during this period, and then, during World War II, to vocational high schools. In 1934, Nathan C. Wyeth succeeded Albert Harris as Municipal Architect; he retired in 1946. All of the 1930s schools were designed in the Colonial Revival style established by Harris and approved by the Commission of Fine Arts. Gradually, stylistic refinement and prominent embellishment fell victim to economic constraint at the insistence of Congress. The population of the District increased by more than a quarter million residents during World War II, and as the war neared its end, construction of schools to accommodate demographic changes became an urgent priority. The Office of the Municipal Architect responded to the crisis with a series of schools. Under Nathan Wyeth's successor Merrel A. Coe, the design for these buildings gradually evolved from merely applying a Moderne vocabulary to the much -repeated 1928 prototype for an extensible school building, to an altogether new plan based upon the functio nal aesthetics of postwar modernism and the International style. Varied interior functions were expressed by a dynamic asymmetrical massing of volumetric elements, as in the new prototypical design for junior high schools, featuring long classroom blocks on either side of a central entrance tower. Many of the newcomers during World War II were African -American, and in the segregated school system, the hardships caused by the wartime halt in school construction were now borne disproportionately borne by their children. Construction of schools for African -American students became a priority and included the majority of new schools and additions to schools built after the war. As increasing numbers of white families moved to the suburbs, the Board of Educ ation further attempted to remedy the imbalance in school facilities by shifting school boundaries and finally by reassigning formerly white schools to the black system, most notably in 1950 by relocating the overcrowded Cardozo High School to the old Cent ral High School. DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 133 The first direct challenge to the segregated school system after the war came in 1947, as part of the sustained national struggle leading to the Supreme Court public school desegregation cases in 1954. After these decisions, the D.C. Pub lic Schools drew national attention and scrutiny as the first jurisdiction in the country to desegregate its schools. For the remainder of the decade, the schools faced the continuing problems of reorganization, overcrowding, teacher shortages, and poor d istribution of facilities relative to the locations of greatest need.

Rawlins Park was first improved in 1873, in preparation for the statue of General Rawlins in 1874. The area around the park remained largely undeveloped, however, and in 1886, at the request of veterans, the statue was removed to Market Square. The park was redesigned and 1916 -17, coincident with the construction of the new I nterior Department building on its north. The new design, by Office of Public Buildings and Grounds Landscape Architect George Burnap, featured a central fountain, in a deliberate departure from the Victorian habit of placing an equestrian statue in the c enter of the park. With the demolition of the Center Market in 1931, the statue of Rawlins was returned to the park in 1931. Construction of the New Interior Department Building, and consequent street widening, occasioned another redesign and reconstruct ion of the park, by landscape architects Donald Klein and Leland Bartlett, in 1935 -38.

Prominently sited opposite the U.S. Treasury, it influenced the design of other city banks. The bank was established in 1840 as Corcoran & Riggs, by William W. Corcoran (a former official of the Second Bank of the U.S.) and George Washington Riggs (the heir of a New York banking family). The bank purchased many assets of Second Bank of the U.S. after its failure, and handled numerous Federal government transactions including the financing of the Mexican War (1846 -48), early international sales of U.S. bonds, and the Alaska purchase (1868). It also financed notable private ventures including construction of the first U.S. telegraph line to Baltimore. It has served many Presidents and notables, and played a major role in addressing the 1933 banking crisis. It was located a t this site in the former home of Second Bank of the United States from 1846. On Corcoran's retirement in 1854, it was renamed Riggs & Co.; in 1896, it was federally chartered as Riggs National Bank in 1896. The monumental granite bank with its impressiv e facade of Ionic columns, and lofty skylit banking hall with neoclassical decoration was built in 1899 -1902.

Established largely through the efforts of Dorothea Dix, the leading mental health reformer of the 19th century, it was chartered by Congress in 1852 as the Government Hospital for the Insane, with the mission to provide the most humane care and enlig htened curative treatment for patients from the Army, Navy, and District of Columbia. The hospital opened in 1855, and shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War was impressed into service as a general hospital for sick and wounded combatants. It was t hese wartime patients who originated the use of the name Saint Elizabeths, after the property's 17th century land patent , out reluct ance to use the hospital's formal name. Congress officially renamed the institution in 1916. As was customary and consider ed healthful, the hospital grounds were established outside the city limits, on what was the Barry Farm overlooking the Anacostia River. The first structure, the innovative four -story Center Building (1853 -55), was designed by superintendent Charles Nicho ls and architect Thomas U. Walter in a castellated Gothic style. The building was an early example of the linear plan for mental hospital wards developed by reformer Thomas Kirkbride. Several more buildings were constructed to treat veterans after the Civil War, and by the 1890s the institution grew into a complex of residential and treatment buildings as well as a central kitchen, boiler house , ice plant, bakery, dairy, firehouse, gatehouses, and barns. A major expansion occurred at the turn of the ce ntury, with Italianate classical buildings designed by Boston architects Shepley, Rutan & Coolidge; fu rther expansion occurred through the 1950s. T he campus is also notable for its designed picturesque landscapes. Gardening became part of patient therapy , as did work on the hospital farm, which lasted into the twentieth century. St. Elizabeths served as a model for later institutions, both as a pioneer of humane treatment of the mentally ill and for its advancement of innovative therapeut ic and diagnosti c techniques. Over 150 years, the hospital treated perhaps 125,000 patients, and at its mid -20th century peak, housed 7,000 patients with a staff of 4,000. Well -known patients have included presidential assassin Charles Guiteau and poet Ezra Pound. Thou sands of former patients are believed to be buried in unmarked graves across the campus, and several hundred Civil War soldiers are interred in two small cemeteries.

The bank was formed in 1912, during an economic rebound following the Knickerbocker Panic of 1907, and the two - story building was constructed in 1912 -13. The layout of the bank, with apartments upstairs, and shops and apartments in an adjacent wing on 7th Street (now demolished), is illustrative of the investment strategies needed to sustain such small institutions. The bank failed in the banking crisis of 1933, and was on e of eight banks merged and reorganized as the Hamilton National Bank. The building design by the firm of (Alfred) Rich & (Alphonsus) FitzSimons typifies the customary classical style. The temple -front fa\u00e7ade is executed in textured buff brick with limes tone and terra cotta trim. Large arched windows with iron grilles, and a long side window bay light the banking hall. The building is now the lone survivor of a once -vibrant commercial block.

This square was not developed as a rectangular park because of the trolley tracks laid along Pe nnsylvania Avenue during the Civil War in 1862. The Avenue was paved through the square in 1872, and the triangular reservations may have been graded and planted by 1876. In 1883, the Office of Public Buildings & Grounds proposed rerouting of the streetc ar and roadway to create a rectangular park, but this did not occur. The square was known as Seward Place by that time (presumably in honor of Lincoln's Secretary of State), but it was not formally named Seward Square until 1903, when a grassy median was added along the streetcar tracks. Fifth Street was removed from the park in 1963, and the park was relandscaped in 1975, after completion of Metro construction.

The neighborhood developed mostly after the Civil War as an economically and racially mixed community, with buildings of diverse quality in a rich variety of architectural styles. Rowhous es dominate a streetscape punctuated by churches, apartment buildings, and a few commercial strips. Owner -built homes are scattered throughout, but most of the housing stock is speculative construction, reflecting late -19th century mass - production technol ogy and a taste for more elaborate building form and embellishment.

By the end of the 19th century, educators nationwide began to promote the idea of industrial education alongside a more traditional academic one that prepared high school students for college. Architecturally, the imposing buff brick and limestone structure designed by Henry Ives Cobb reflects both the city's attempt to improve public school design through the use of private architects, and Cobb's Chicago origins, particularly in the third -floor running arcade of Romanesque DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 145 arches. When McKinley moved to its larger Eckington campus in 1928, this building was converted to Shaw Junior High School, for African -America n students. From the beginning, Shaw was overcrowded and the building deteriorating, and as conditions worsened, the building \u2014dubbed Shameful Shaw \u2014became emblematic of the city's neglect of African Americans.

The real estate syndicate of Greenleaf, Morris, and Nicholson undertook construction of the houses in 1795 as part of a contract with the District Commissi oners to build twenty houses annually, but as there was some doubt whether they met specifications for height and coverage, they were sold to Isaac Polock, who completed them. After 1800, to relieve cramped conditions in the Treasury Office, the buildings briefly housed government offices.

The school is nationally significant for its role in the U. S. Supreme Court case Bolling v. Sharpe , which was decided the same day as the four public school desegregation cases combined in Brown v. Board of Education . The case originated in September 1950, when in a move orchestrated by civil rights lawyers, Spot tswood Bolling and other black children were denied enrollment in the new all -white school. While the Court's ruling in Brown established that the states could not maintain segregated public schools, its simultaneous ruling in Bolling made such schools al so unconstitutional if maintained by the federal government. Drawing moral authority from the heart of the nation's capital, the ruling reinforced the absolute magnitude of the decisions striking down the separate but equal doctrine. Merrel A. Coe, arc hitect.

When it opened in 19 28, it was the first motion picture theater constructed east of the Anacostia River for African -American patrons. The Strand was a center of community social life for more than 40 years and reinforced the self -sufficiency of the neighborhood. It was also reflective of the trend in the early motion picture industry to provide affordable but segregated neighborhood -based entertainment. The Strand is also significant for its association with its owner and builder, Abe E. Lichtman. A white Jew, Lichtman bec ame a nationally known advocate for equal economic opportunities for African Americans, and was an important business leader through his ties with Franklin D. and Eleanor Roosevelt. His theater staffs were almost always African American at a time when few would be hired for white -collar jobs, and he was also active in sponsoring recreational opportunities for African - American youth. The Strand is designed in a stripped -down version of the Renaissance Revival style, with facades characterized by symmetrica l balance and a restrained use of classical elements.

The most profound of these was the streetcar, both horse -drawn and motorized. The early routes of the streetcar followed the 1791 plan for the Federal City, drafted by Pierre L'Enfant seventy years before the first railway tracks were laid. The earliest lines followed the plan's princip al thoroughfares, connecti ng the established residential and commercial areas of Georgetown with the centers of government along Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House to the United States Capitol, and beyond to the Navy Yard. The railway lines linked the wharves in southwest Wa shington, D.C. with the mercantile corridor along 7th Street, 14th Street, and the growing residential neighborhoods to the north. These 1862 horse -drawn routes reflected the city's developing nineteenth -century residential, commercial, and employment pat terns. Although a technological innovation, the earliest horse -drawn railway routes conformed to and reinforced existing transportation patterns that had been served by earlier, less efficient conveyances such as the horse -drawn omnibuses, herdics, and ho rse-drawn carriages. By the early 1890s, railway companies began to experiment with storage batteries, compressed air, overhead lines, underground cable, and electric traction that enabled streetcars to travel faster and climb steeper grades. Accordingly, the expansion of the railway lines became a tool used by real estate developers to encourage the DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 151 city's burgeoning population to inhabit new neighborhoods, which improved the original city and then started to development localities outside the original ci ty boundaries. These street railway lines were typically owned and operated by the real estate developers who maintained an interest in the neighborhood, streetcar line, and the first of the generating power companies. The late -nineteenth -century era of r apid transit expansion, spurred by land developers, was followed by a period of consolidation in the early twentieth century. Owners, seeking profits in transportation and utilities over land development, simplified the routes and generally extended lines to serve established employment and residential areas rather than to promote new ones. In its heyday, roughly between 1903 and 1933, Washington, D.C.'s electric traction system consisted of two large companies operating city and suburban services, several separate suburban lines, and three interurban lines. This service, which was instrumental in the development of the nation's capital, functioned along side the automobile by the second decade of the twentieth century, and eventually was replaced by the mot or bus in 1962. Thus, for nearly one hundred years, streetcars, both horse - drawn and electric, played a major role in the development of Washington, D.C.

Authorized in 1937, it was not built until 1943 -44, when it was considered an important transportat ion route to a major military airfield. Suitland Parkway exemplifies the type of defense highway advocated by Franklin Roosevelt, and it is also associated with key figures in the development of parkway design, Gilmore D. Clarke and Jay Downer. It was a new type of road combining parkway principles with the freeway efficiency of the German autobahn.

Syph ax was a proponent of a unified public school system, and a vigorous advocate for equal educational standards; he oversaw construction of both Sumner and Stevens Schools. The original Colonial Revival structure, built in 1901 (Marsh & Peter, architects), is a fine example of the public schools that the D.C.

It is the most important surviving work of architect Calvin T. S. Brent, the first African American in Washington trained as a professional architect and the first to support himself solely b y his architectural practice. Though operating within the arena of segregation, Brent was able to accomplish a large body of work from 1876 until his death at the age of 45 in 1899, inspiring the next generation of black architects. Third Baptist was the last of his churches, and the only one clearly credited as his work to survive in intact condition. It is a large, basilican -plan brick edifice with a tall corner tower, traceried stained glass windows, elaborate corbelled cornices, and a gable roof cover ed with what is probably the original slate, some of which appears to retain its polychrome pattern. The builder was Edward Winslow. The only substantial alteration to the building occurred in 1919 when the church added a new choir loft, organ loft, and baptismal pool designed by African -American architect Isaiah T. Hatton. As one of the oldest and most active African American congregations in Washington (organized in 1858), Third Baptist strove to advance the political and educational rights of Africa n Americans during eras of great hostility. Although Third Baptist did not include the oldest and wealthiest black families, it shared many of the concerns of the city's most elite black churches. It was committed to temperance and education and was will ing to work with sympathetic white churches. Under the 41 -year pastorate of Reverend George O. Bullock from 1918 to 1959, Third Baptist grew to one of the largest and most influential churches in the city. During his tenure, the church was active in supp orting the work of organizations like the NAACP and Negro National Educational Congress, organizing mass meetings, seeking voting rights, and pushing for desegregation of the public schools and armed forces. During the turbulent period of the1960s, Third Baptist played an important role in distributing aid to people in the neighborhood uprooted by the devastating riots of 1968, and it narrowly averted demolition of its building for the Shaw urban renewal project.

Pei and Partners and principal designer Araldo Cossutta. A European -trained prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the famous Swiss architect LeCorbusier, Cossutta was a visionary architect interested in exp loring the possibilities of architectural concrete as an expressive and technologically innovative medium. This complex was among the last in the firm's progression of experimental concrete structures in Denver, Chicago, New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Washington, and was directly inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright's concrete Unity Temple of 1905 -06. As in these earlier structures, the Christian Science buildings employ concrete as an integral material that unifies structure with both interior and exterio r finish. The church is bold and uncompromising in its geometric forms, set off by the brick plaza and broad ribbons of glass on the office facade. Also notable are the effects of natural light in elegant, unobstructed interior spaces separated from outs ide distractions.

The building was erected between 1836 and 1869, and is the work of five major American architects \u2014Robert Mills, Thomas U. Walter, Ammi B. Young, Isaiah Rogers, and Alfred B. Mullett. Conceived and built in the Greek Revival style which so captured the spirit of the young republic, this building and the Patent Office, undertaken at the same time, are the most outstandi ng examples of Greek Revival civil architecture in the country. Not only were they the largest non -military buildings undertaken by the federal government in their own time, but they also influenced countless examples of civil architecture across the nati on. From 1800, the Treasury Department was housed in the first of George Hadfield's three brick Executive Offices, built in 1798 -99 on the site of the present north wing. The Treasury Office caught fire in 1801, 1814, and 1833, and was not reconstructed after the third conflagration. Robert Mills, who had been in the capital since 1830, was asked to assess the fire, and by 1836, his plans for a new Treasury building were accepted by Andrew Jackson. Undoubtedly, a major reason for Mills's selection was h is interest in fireproof construction, demonstrated by his Fireproof Building (1822 -27) in Charleston, South Carolina. Mills had also studied with both Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Latrobe. Mills's design for the Treasury called for an E -shaped buildi ng opening west toward the White House, with a long classical fa\u00e7ade on 15th Street, but only the east front and center wing were built under his supervision, from 1836 to 1842. The unusual vaulted structural system of the building and its monumental scal e aroused suspicion in Congress, and some sharp professional jealousies among rival architects. In 1838, a bill was introduced in Congress to authorize the demolition of the half -completed structure. The architect presenting the case for demolition was T homas U. Walter, Philadelphia's leading Greek Revival practitioner. Walter was appointed Architect of the Capitol in 1851, and he was authorized to prepare plans for extending the Treasury in 1855. His concept, which was carried through as others execute d the work, established the ultimate rectangular layout, double courtyards, and porticoed facades. The south wing was built from 1855 to 1861, under the supervision of Ammi B. Young, appointed Supervising DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 158 Architect of the Treasury in 1852. While Mills ha d been forced to use Aquia Creek sandstone, the extension was carried out in granite. The columns were monoliths, whereas Mills's had been built up in drums. Rogers was abruptly dismissed by Secretary Salmon P. Chase in 1862, and replaced by Isaiah Roger s, who remained in the job until 1865, supervising completion of the west wing (1855 -64), addition of an attic floor on all the wings (1863 -65), and preliminary planning for the north wing. Upon his resignation, Rogers was succeeded by his former subordin ate Alfred B. Mullett, who completed the north wing from 1867 to 1869. This wing contains the elaborately decorated marble Banking Room, which was the setting for Ulysses Grant's first inaugural ball in 1869. The Mills interiors are minimally decorated, their volumetric architectural character resulting from the masonry barrel -vaulted corridors, flanked by groin -vaulted offices. The elegantly curved, cantilevered marble staircases are a signature of his work. In contrast, the interiors of the three lat er wings rely much more on interior decoration for their architectural character. Their structural system, influenced by the emergent cast iron technology, is one of shallow segmental brick vaults supported on cast iron beams, producing rectilinear volume s and a much less sculptural appearance. In these wings, Young, Rogers, and Mullett made extensive and imaginative use cast iron of and cast plaster decoration, including cast iron pilasters and friezes in the main corridors. Mullett's Cash Room is the m ost lavish space in the building, displaying seven varieties of marble in the paneled walls, and richly sculptural bronze railings for the balcony. By the late 1890s, the need for additional office space led to the insertion of a large truss -roofed drafti ng room in the south courtyard, for use by the Supervising Architect of the Treasury. By 1980, the poor quality of the building's original Aquia Creek sandstone led to the rebuilding of Mills's colonnade. Architects York and Sawyer added an attic story t o the building in 1909 -10, and made other alterations through 1923. The north entrance statue of Alexander Hamilton, by James Earle Fraser on a base by Henry Bacon, was also installed in 1923.

They were the first to deviate from the traditional two -story plan, and the first d esigned in the Colonial Revival style, a mode of expression favored by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts as appropriate for municipal institutions in the city's residential neighborhoods. The innovative floor plan arranged the dormitory rooms on an open me zzanine above the apparatus floor, leaving a two -story space in the center. The plan was apparently unsuccessful and was never repeated; the central opening has since been filled in. The simple but elegant brick building is reminiscent of a colonial chur ch or market house; the front -gable design features a central hose tower flanked by arched apparatus doors, with blind arches continuing along the building sides. Unfortunately, its historic character has suffered from the loss of the double -tiered frame cupola.

Built by the Consolidated Engineering Company of Baltimore, the plant's architects of record were Kubitz & Koenig, the Baltimore construction engineering firm of civil engineers Otto Kubitz and Martin Koenig, Jr. The adjacent Uline Arena was added in 193 9-40. Hailed as a triumph in concrete when complete, the arena was the first thin -shell concrete building erected in Washington and one of the first in the country. Roberts & Schaefer, a Chicago engineering firm, designed the structure, using its exclusive U.S. patent rights to the innovative German Zeiss -Dywidag system of reinforced concrete roof ing. The contractor was the White Construction Company of New York. The vaulted roof allowed for a 140- by 270 -foot unobstructed interior space that accommodated the largest indoor hockey rink in the country. Built for ice sports, it was immediately adapted for boxing and musical events, and then also for professional bas ketball, tennis, wrestling, and even midget auto racing. Like many other public accommodations in Washington at the time, the arena's events were racially segregated, except for matches involving black boxers. During World War II, local chapters of the NAACP encouraged a boycott of the arena and after the war resumed the campaign for nearly a year, until Uline relented in 1948. Ironically, as Washington Coliseum, the arena subsequently became an important venue for African -American cultural and political events. Nation of Islam founder Elijah Muhammad and his disciple, Malcolm X, spoke there in 1959 and 1961. And in the 1980s, it was most notable as home to performances of Washington's indigenous Go -Go music. It is also remembered as the site of the fi rst United States appearance of The Beatles.

Lewis. A self -made man, Lewis was president of the United Mine Workers of America for more than 40 years. In 1936, in the midst of t he Great Depression, his purchase of this elegant building from a failing club not only provided a base of operations for lobbying government officials, but also validated the strength of the union in its war of class struggle. Lewis expunged the inscribe d university names and shields from the facades, and added a top floor pavilion housing a heavy -timbered assembly room for union officers. The building recalls not only the influence of the elite gentlemen's clubs that were once significant in Washington' s social life, but also the achievements of the United Mine Workers of America, which reshaped its appearance and occupied it for more than a half century. It forms part of the monumental streetscape around McPherson Square, and typifies the efforts of pr ivate organizations to embellish the national capital (President Taft laid the cornerstone). It is a fine example of Italian Renaissance Revival design, by the influential Washington architect George Oakley Totten; the 1937 alterations (also Italianate) w ere designed by the noted Washington architects Porter & Lockie. The building is six stories (originally five), with rusticated facades of limestone and tan brick, a piano nobile of monumental arched windows, and central portico; grand interior rooms rema in.

The Courthouse was one of four federal buildings directly inspired by and constructed in the first years of implementation of a sweeping initiative introduced by President John F. Kennedy to improve the design of the country's federal buildings. Under Kennedy's Guiding Principles for Federal Architectur e, the federal government moved away from the cautious Modernism that had characterized public buildings of the post -War era and committed itself to using renowned and respected architects to create new and creative public buildings. Also, in adopting t he Guiding Principles , the government deliberately sought to avoid an official style for its federal buildings. Designed by architect Victor Lundy, the Tax Court is an outstanding example of federal architecture of its time, and the most prominent public work of the architect's notable career. It used the most advanced structural engineering to achieve an expressive purpose, and its structural daring is without precedent in federal architecture. Conceived as a monolithic block separated into its constitu ent functional units, the building's tour-de-force is its massive granite courtroom block poised as if weightless above a fully glazed entry. The virtuoso suspension is accomplished through the use of steel post -tensioning cables concealed in reinforced concrete shear walls and structural bridges, invisibly connecting to six supporting columns. The cabling system creates an equal balance between forces of tension and compression to stabilize the building. The interior of the building mirrors the clarity of its exterior design and offers a rich array of modern construction materials.

Since 1924, it has been associated with medical education as the site of the Walter Reed Army Medical School. The hospital campus is also significant for its architecture and design. The layout was influenced by both Beaux Arts planning pr inciples and John Shaw Billings' revolutionary design for Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. The central administration building is the focal structure in a formal, axial plan with a series of dispersed wards and support facilities arranged in an ample landscaped setting. The buildings are united by their Georgian Colonial Revival architecture in red brick with wood and limestone trim. The site for the campus was acquired in 1905, and the hospital opened in 1908. Between 1920 and 1922, the hospital ex panded with the acquisition of additional property that had already been subdivided into residential lots. Fifteen detached houses were included in the purchase, and were adapted for officer's housing. The original Main Hospital (1908) has seven major ad ditions \u2014the Mess, Kitchen and Wards (1914), East and West Pavilions (1915), East and West Wings (1928), and General Mess, Library, and Wards (1928).

A superlative illustr ation of early military involvement in the civil sector, the aqueduct epitomizes the emergence of the Army Corps of Engineers into the field of public works and consequent major economic influence. It is also a monumental engineering achievement of design er, engineer, and Civil War Quartermaster General Montgomery Meigs. The aqueduct system includes a masonry dam at Great Falls, six bridges including the 220 -foot masonry arch at Cabin John (the world's longest masonry arch DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 167 when built), a mile of tunnels, twelve miles of conduit, brick air vents, and various control facilities. The water supply crosses Rock Creek and enters the city at the Pennsylvania Avenue (Meigs) Bridge, where it passes through arched cast -iron conduit tubes that also support the bridg e. In the original bridge of 1861 -62, these huge pipes were exposed, but they are now partially concealed by a 1916 granite facing and soffit. The District portion of the aqueduct includes Dalecarlia Reservoir, a nine -foot diameter masonry conduit unde r MacArthur Boulevard (originally Conduit Road), and Georgetown Reservoir. Notable structures include the inscribed sluice tower at Dalecarlia Reservoir, superintendent's house at Dalecarlia, and Georgetown Reservoir with its air vent and Castle Gatehouse (built 1901).

Streetcar tracks were laid around the circle in 1862, and after the ne glect during the Civil War, further improvements were made in 1869 and 1874.

Platted in 1888, the neighborhood features i ntact groups of late 19th - century row houses along its grid streets, early -20th century luxury apartment houses framing the larger avenues, and an eclectic mix of commercial structures (both purpose built and modified) along both sides of 18th Street. The development of Washington Heights illustrates the neighborhood's architectural evolution from a streetcar suburb on the outskirts of the original city limits to a vibrant urban neighborhood and commercial corridor. Once a bucolic setting on the breezy he ights at the northern boundary of the city, the area was first attractive for its easy walking distance to the horse -drawn streetcar line that terminated at Connecticut and Florida Avenues. But its major growth was spurred by the electric streetcars exten ded through the subdivision along 18th Street in 1892, and along Columbia Road in 1896. Until the early 1920s, Washington Heights remained mostly white and middle -class, but in the 1920s and 1930s, European and Asian immigrants began moving into the nei ghborhood, many operating small businesses on 18th Street, or working for the nearby embassies. These immigrants brought slow but increasing diversity to the neighborhood. Similarly, the neighborhood's African -American population, at first largely limite d to servants or janitors living in the homes or apartments where they worked, became more diversified by 1930, with a large concentration along Vernon Street in particular. The sweeping demographic and social changes that define the neighborhood today di d not occur until after World War II, when a housing shortage in the city caused many of the single -family row houses to be transformed into rooming houses, attracting a majority African American population. The changing demographics and the declining val ue of the area's real estate spurred the departure of many middle -class white families to the suburbs. Beginning in the 1950s and 60s, the area became increasingly attractive to Spanish -speaking residents, due in part to its affordability and to its proxi mity to Hispanic embassies. As political turmoil afflicted Latin American countries in the 1960s, the Latino population grew, and during the 1970s, in addition to increasing numbers of African Americans and Latin Americans, new ethnic groups, including Ca ribbeans, Southeast Asians, and Africans moved into the neighborhood, creating a multi -cultural and multi -national community that is part of the neighborhood's defining character.

DC designation July 27, 2006 (effective September 10, 2006 ), NR listing September 27, 2006 Washington Hilton 1919 Connecticut Avenue, NW Constructed in 1962 -65, the Washington Hilton was hailed for its sinuous massing, its use of column -and-slab construction throughout, and its uniform precast concrete wall pane ls\u2014in sum, a sharp departure from local traditions . Architect William B. Tabler created an important example of Modern design in Washington, innovative structurally, functionally, and ae sthetically. Tabler, a Harvard -trained Midwesterner, first achieved success as the principal designer of the Statler Hotel at 16th and K Streets, and later as lead architect for the Statler company. When Conrad Hilton purchased the Statler chain in 1954, Tabler became the chief architect for the Hilton Corporation, starting him on a path to becoming perhaps America's greatest hotel architect, responsible for more than 400 hotels during his lifetime. Tabler emphasized highly efficient function, attention to labor -saving details, and economy through the employment of new construction methods and building systems. He also favored materials like concrete, which offered lower material costs and speed in assembly, but also plasticity for dramatic massing and d etail. On projects like the Washington Hilton, it allowed the Modern grid to be bent and shaped expressionistically while creating depth, shadow and the visual contrast of large window s within a light-colored grid. The gull -wing design of the Hilton avoids straight views down long, monotonous halls, maximizes the number of rooms with DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 169 southern light and views, and allows the blank slab ends to become focal points of the design. The exuberant floating canopies represent another expressionistic touch insp ired by the thin -shell concrete roofs popularized in the 1950s and 60s. In keeping with Conrad Hilton's motto, World Peace Through International Trade and Travel , the building's evocation of sails and wings \u2014and famous airline terminals \u2014was an appropriate idiom for an establishment welcoming diplomats from around the globe to the capital of the free world.

While often considered part of the Mall, the Monument Grounds have always been a separate reservation. The equestrian statue envisioned by L'Enfant as the western terminus of the great axis from the Capi tol was never built; instead, the obelisk designed by Robert Mills was constructed over an extended period from 1848 to 1884. The McMillan Commission's plans for a formal, geometric garden to improve the grounds were never implemented. See separate listi ng Washington Naval Hospital (Naval Medical School Hospital) : see Potomac Annex Historic District. Built 1904 - 07, the Georgian Revival hospital (now Potomac Annex Buildings 3 and 4) was designed by Ernest Flagg, who was particularly known for his hospital designs and for his innovative uses of reinforced concrete, of which this building is an example. The pavilion plan used in the two connected buildings reflects an important trend in hospital design of the era, and the buildings also incorporated a sophisticated ventilation system. Hospital Buildings : Seven buildings constructed in 1908 -11 according to designs by the Bureau of Yards & Docks include Female Nurses Quarters (Building 1), Sick Officers' Quarters (Building 5), Contagious Ward (Building 6), Male Nu rses' Quarters (Building 7), and three officers' residences (Quarters A, B, and C). The Georgian Revival hip -roofed buildings in yellow brick with brick quoins, stone trim, and wooden entry porticoes are more conservative and less distinctive in design th an the main hospital, but as a group, they form a handsome and coherent architectural complex expressing a unified function. Washington Navy Yard (Original Appropriation No. 14): see the Plan of the City of Washington and Washington DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 170 Navy Yard Historic District. Washington Navy Yard East Extension [National Register eligible] Bounded by the Anacostia River, Parsons Avenue, M, and 11th Streets, SE The East Extension is an integral part of the Navy Yard's complex of industrial buildings. It was crucial to the naval weapons development and testing mission during World Wars I and II, when the Yard was the center of the nationwide naval ordna nce production system. The East Extension supported the production facilities primarily located in the western annex to the Yard. Some of the early buildings, such as the Experimental Mine Testing Laboratory and the Ordnance Laboratory, played an importa nt role in ordnance testing. The extension as a whole is associated with the development of ordnance technology, and played a critical role in developing the nation's 20th-century military industrial wartime strength. It includes 18 contributing building s dating from 1918 to1944. The east extension had its origins in the McMillan Plan effort to reorganize the rail lines intruding into the city. Several Acts of Congress in 1901 required that portions of these lines, including the extension that served th e western portion of the Navy Yard, be removed from public streets no later than 1908. The Navy planned a replacement line into the eastern side of the Yard, and pursued land acquisition along the Anacostia, but a lengthy conflict over title and compensat ion ensued. The Navy ultimately settled on alternative access from the west, but with the onset of war, land was needed for expansion, and in 1917 the Navy acquired a much larger eastern annex than first anticipated. The Navy placed new buildings on the site as the need arose. The original plan was for storage and support functions in the eastern area, but as the site evolved, some manufacturing shops were located there as well. With the onset of World War II, construction in the eastern annex increased , creating a new area of dense development within the walled yard. Eligible for NR as part of the Washington Navy Yard; US ownership; see also Washington Navy Yard Historic District Range Finding Tower and Optical Shop (Building 157): Built in 1918 -19, this four -story brick structure housed a unique function important to weapons production. The visually distinctive, projecting top story of the 100-foot high range finding tower was used to calibrate and check various range finders, using the distances from the tower to various other structures as standards. It was probably the only such facility in the country at the time it was built. The optical shop was intended for lens repair and manufacturing. Seaman Gunners' School (Building 166): Established i n 1892, the Seaman Gunners' School was one of the first Navy programs intended to give enlisted men an opportunity to learn specialized skills for advancement to commissioned rank. While training was not a central component of the industrial mission of th e Navy Yard, the school complemented the primary function of ordinance production. The three -story building with gold brick facades, stone trim, and modillioned cornice is distinctive in the Yard because of its residential appearance. The northern wing w as built about 1918, and the southern wing in 1940. Experimental Mine Laboratory (Building 172): The site of significant anti -submarine and mine -related work at the Yard, this two -story brick building was one of the most important mine research facilitie s in the nation. Built in 1918, it is one of the few buildings in the east extension to display architectural embellishment, including an arched portico and entry with nautical mosaics, cast stone window hoods, decorative brickwork, and a diamond -patterne d belt course. Proof Shop (Building 175): Guns were assembled and inspected in this one -story brick building, originally lit by huge multi -paned industrial sash windows. It was built in 1919 -22. Storage and Service Buildings: Secondary storage buildin gs on the site include the Laundry (Building 126), built 1904 and probably relocated; Ninth Street Garage (Building 169), built 1918 -19/1936; and Paint and Oil Storage Building (Building 184), built 1919 -21. DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 171 Quarters S, T, W, and Y: These four rowhouses were part of the existing residential district when the Navy purchased the site for expansion. They were retained due to the lack of immediately available housing during World War I, and remain as the only vestige of the former use of the site. Quarters S, T, and W are Queen Anne rowhouses dating from about 1898. Quarters Y is a flat -fronted classical rowhouse with a front porch, dating from about 1914. Experimental Ammunition Building (Building 195): Built in 1937, this small classical revival buildin g with rusticated limestone door surround was intended for the development of innovative ordnance technologies in anticipation of another world conflict. Administration Building (Building 200): Strongly reminiscent of the sleek, modernist designs of the mid-20th century, and of industrial buildings by Albert Kahn, this massive brick structure with ribbon windows and stylized Art Moderne cornice was built in 1940 as the administrative headquarters for the gun factory. Optical Shop Annex (Building 210): Built by the U.S. Public Works program in 1941, this workshop provided facilities for manufacture, testing, and storage of optical instruments, and played a significant role in the development of aviation ordinance. The four -story concrete frame structure with brick spandrels and multi - pane industrial sash is similar to the factory buildings on the western side of the yard. Gauge Laboratory (Building 219) and Aviation Ordinance Building (Building 220): Built in 1944, this pair of four -story concrete and b rick industrial buildings housed specialized functions essential to the World War II ordnance production. Their design is similar to Building 210. Storage and Service Buildings: Secondary storage buildings from the World Ware II era include the Ordnance Storehouse (Building 196), built 1940; and Optical Storehouse (Building 203), built 1941. Washington Navy Yard Historic District Bounded by M Street SE on the north, Parso ns Avenue on the east, the Anacostia River on the south, and 1st Street on the west The nation's first naval yard and first home port was begun in 1799, becoming the center for early -19th century naval operations during a critical period of expanding natio nalism. The Yard was the major site for U.S. naval gun manufacture since about 1850, and was the center of a nationwide naval weapons production system during World Wars I and II. It saw the development of important ordnance technology, including the man ufacture of the largest -caliber naval guns ever produced in America. Ultimately, the Navy Yard grew to a massive complex of industrial buildings and supply yards, with much heavy equipment, becoming the city's largest concentration of industrial architect ure. At the end of the 19th century, the Navy Yard was expanded westward to ac commodate more gun and ordnance manufacture ; the new annex was enclosed by an extension of the Navy Yard wall . The Navy Yard experienced growth in bursts coinciding with major naval construction campaigns \u2014including the building of Theodore Roosevelt's Great White Fleet after the Spanish -American War and the arms race that culminated in World War I. Contributing buildings in the western annex include two major building types: multi -story manufacturing structures of concrete post -and-beam construction, and foundry -type buildings spanned by roof trusses, and providing large, uninterrupted interior spaces for assembly -line manufacture with overhead electric cranes. Navy Yard expansion continued with the onset of World War II, in which the yard played a major role as the command center for naval ordnance production. The Navy Yard was renamed the U.S. Naval Gun Factory in 1945; production stopped in 1962.

As a DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 173 pioneering example of urban redevelopment , however, the Watergate C omplex is significant both for its architecture and planning. In the era of suburbanization, t he Watergate was private urban redevelopment project of unprecedented scale, aiming to renew an aging largely industrial area through a combination of urban and suburban amenities. It was also one of the first to make use of the 1958 zoning revision s that permitted Planned Unit Developments \u2014projects that typically mix uses in a way not normally permitted, in exchange for special amenities. The design of the comp lex was conceived by 1961, and was substantially complete by 1971. The six component buildings, interconnected by underground garages , a shared group of shops, and some surface hyphens are: Watergate East (2500 Virginia Avenue, NW): 13 -story apartment ho use, built 1964 2600 Virginia Avenue : 11-story office building, built 1966 -67 Watergate Hotel (2650 Virginia Avenue, NW): 13 -story hotel, built 1966 -67 Watergate West (2700 Virginia Avenue, NW): 13 -story apartments, built 1967 Watergate South (700 New H ampshire Avenue, NW): 14 -story residential, built 1969 -71 600 New Hampshire Avenue : 12-story office building , built 1969 -71 The Watergate is an early example of the modern idea of using proximity and orientation to take advantage of expansive views over rivers and parks, and it was a striking departure from the city's planning and architectural traditions. Like other modernist urban renewal efforts, it offered a mix of uses creating a self-contained and self-sufficient unit , but i n doing so it erased an older urban fabric of buildings and streets, leaving an insular town within the city. The Watergate was also a visually striking addition to a city not known for important Modernist works. Curvilinear forms relate the buildings to each other and to th e site, exemplifying the modernis t embrace of organic forms and taking full advantage of the plasticity of concrete, which is used both as a structural and finish material. T his was one of the earliest projects to employ computer -aided design to render an d dimension the curved exterior surfaces. The Watergate's designer was Luigi Moretti, one of the most important Italian Futurist architects, and it is perhaps his most famous work , one of only two commissions in North America . The modernist landscape des ign by Boris Timchenko accentuates the space carved out by the buildings, with plantings, fountains and pools on successive gentle terraces affording u nimpeded views toward the river from multiple vantage points at different elevations . The site is also s ignificant for its notorious position in American history as the location of the bungled break -in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters during the presidential campaign of 1972. The subsequent cover -up, investigation and scandal nearly led to President Richard M. Nixon's impeachment, and did result in his resignation. The consequences were many and important, including general public disillusionment, subsequent electoral success by the Democrats, and a shift in the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches \u2014not to mention the entry of the word Watergate and scores of derivative -gate scandals and pseudo -scandals into the lexicon.

The building shows how mass -production technology DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 174 influenced the design of civic buildings in an era of great public works. It is an efficient standardized design developed by the Office of the Building Inspector, with austere Romanesque Revival facades by Architect of the Capitol Edward Clark. The contractor was Bright and Humphrey (who also built the Pension Building). Erected in 1882, the building soon became stranded in the growing business district. From 1924 to 1949, it housed the Americanization School, a specialized branch of the public schools with a curriculum based on English and citize nship classes. This institution reflected a national movement after World War I to support the assimilation of immigrants into American society; it was central to the lives of thousands of new citizens naturalized in Washington. The building is three sto ries, red brick with a corbelled cornice, hipped slate roof, multi -paned windows, and heavy brick and stone portal. It was named in honor of the celebrated orator Daniel Webster.

The standing bronze statue is raised on a tall granite pedestal with bronze relief panels depicting two of Webster's most famous speeches. The memorial was commissioned by Washington Post publisher Stilson Hutchins, an admirer of Webster, and a f ellow native of New Hampshire.

Such amenities, often a part of exclusive planned residential communities, influenced progressive suburban planning. Built in 1927 by the noted Washington real estate develo pers W.C. & A.N. Miller, the clubhouse illustrates the superior design, construction, and craftsmanship that distinguish their work in Wesley Heights. It originally housed clubrooms, a grocery, pharmacy with postal substation, and the Miller Company real estate office. The \"English\" design by Miller company architect Gordon E. MacNeil reflects the popularity of evocative European revival styles. The building is two stories, red brick and stucco with multiple gables, random limestone quoins, a Chippendale balcony, and shopfronts.

Built in 1897 -98, it is one of the city's first buildings constructed specifically for high school use. The design by architect Harry B. Davis is notable not just for its monumental DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 175 Ionic portico and rejection of Victorian style, but also for its landscaped setting \u2014an innovation attributable to the mature landscape that already existed on the site, a former estate known as The Cedars . The building is three stories with facades of red and buff brick (now painted) with limestone trim. The classroom wings were extended and the auditorium and portico widened as part of a school expansion in 1910, and after a 1914 fire, a new cornice replaced the original balustraded parape t. A rear expansion and auditorium by Municipal Architect Albert Harris date from 1925. Organized in 1890 and first housed at the old Curtis School on O Street, the school originally served white students in the western section of the District and suburb s. It accepted its first class as a high school for the arts in 1974, and graduated its last regular high school class in 1976.

It served as a transmission and receiving station in an experimental radio relay trian gle connecting New York, Philadelphia, Washington and Pittsburgh, inaugurating the first use of microwave radio for commercial communications. The system was an experimental one, intended to replace a century -old wire telegraphy network, and it continued in use for national security communications during the Cold War. Designed by architect Leon Chatelain, Jr., the terminal is an early and rare example of an architect -designed transmission tower, and its image was used in Western Union advertising as the i con for a modern communications system.

It is associated with countless occasions of state, has housed the president's staff and visiting dignitaries, and has served from its earliest years as a place for the presid ent to receive the public. Officially named the Executive Mansion, the White House very quickly assumed its common name from the whitewash applied to its Aquia creek sandstone walls; President Roosevelt adopted the name officially in 1902. The design of the house, by Irish-born architect James Hoban, was selected in competition in 1792. The cornerstone was laid that same year, and the house was occupied in 1800, although construction continued until 1803. After the burning of 1814, the gutted house was reconstructed from 1815 to 1818 under Hoban's supervision. He also supervised construction of the south portico in 1824 and the north portico in 1829, based on designs prepared in 1807 by Benjamin Latrobe. The house has been repeatedly remodeled and expa nded, most significantly by architects McKim, Mead & White, who added the East and West Wings in 1902. In 1909, architect Nathan C. Wyeth expanded the West Wing, adding the first Oval Office. Further rebuilding efforts culminated in a complete reconstruc tion of the interiors and internal structure of the house in 1948 -52. The south portico balcony was added at that time.

White House Grounds : see The Plan of the City of Washington . When the White House and its flanking Executive Offices were completed in 1800, the surrounding gro unds were left unfinished for lack of funds. Thomas Jefferson made the first improvements, including a perimeter enclosure, but these were largely destroyed in the British invasion of the capital in 1814. When rebuilding was completed in 1818, an iron fe nce encircled the grounds, and by 1830 the grounds had been landscaped and planted with hundreds of trees, gardens, and lawn. By 1861, a carriageway was in place at the foot of the south lawn to carry traffic between 15th and 17th Streets. The grounds we re largely neglected during the Civil War, but were substantially improved after the war, and sporadically through changing administrations. The most substantial 20th century redesign was undertaken by the Olmsted brothers in 1936, with the addition of ma sses of trees for privacy, and removal of others to clear the vista to the site of the Jefferson Memorial. David White House 1459 Girard Street, NW From 1910 to 1925, this was the home of David White (1862 -1935), the distinguish ed geologist of the U.S. Geological Survey, best remembered as a leading expert on the origin and evolution of coal and as the author of a theory of oil distribution basic to the petroleum industry.

It represents a period of opti mism in the neighborhood, when scattered upper -middle -class development was spreading east of the 7th Street commercial corridor. The tall, three -bay brick house embodies distinctive characteristics of its style, including its cubic form, elongated 2/2 wi ndows with flat stone lintels, robust wood door surround, and bracketed wood cornice. The two-story rear service wing and the attached carriage house/stable are also characteristic of the period. Little is known about Emily Wiley, who built and first liv ed in the house, but its history reflects the changing urban fortunes of the area. Between 1914 and 1919, it was the home of Holy Rosary parish, established in 1913 by Father Nicholas DeCarlo for Catholics of Italian birth or descent. In the early 1920s, it was occupied by an Italian immigrant and his family, while the rear service wing served as a meat and vegetable market. By the late 1920s, the main block of the house was operating as a store, and it also served as the home of the National Colored Vot ers Union and the Smith and Robinson Club, organizations formed to call for a national conference of African -American voters to support Al Smith 's presidential campaign. During the 1930s, the house was rented out to a working -class family and multiple lod gers.

The house is noted for its irregular plan and eclectic mixture of projecting bays , segmental and round -headed windows, and decorative elements. The house was donated to the University in 1921 by the original owner 's son, General Maxwell Van Zandt Woodhull, a University trustee and benefactor . Woodhull had been instrumental in the University 's decision to relocate from downtown to this block of G Street. William Henry Seward lived in the house between 1855 and 185 8, when he was serving his second term as U.S. Senator from New York. An unsuccessful candidate for the presidency in 1856 and 1860, he was to serve as Secretary of State under Presidents Lincoln and Johnson. Remembered today for having negotiated the pu rchase of Alaska, he was known to his contemporaries as an outspoken opponent of slavery and the first major political figure in the nascent Republican Party. During the Civil War his principal diplomatic objective was to prevent Great Britain from interv ening on the side of the Confederacy.

Woodson House 1538 9th Street, NW For more than 40 years until his death, the preeminent educator, publisher, and historian Carter G. Woodson (1875 -1950) lived and worked in this brick row house. At a time of Jim Crow ideology and enforced segregation, Woodson pioneered the documentation of African -American life and the recognition of African - American contributions to the nation's history. Born to enslaved parents, Woodson was self -educate d until he DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 180 began formal schooling at the age of twenty. He received degrees from Berea College and the University of Chicago, and after several years of teaching, travel, and studies abroad, settled in Washington. In 1912, Woodson became the second Afric an-American (after W.E.B. DuBois) to receive a doctorate from Harvard University. In 1915, he founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, with offices in his home, and a year later, the Journal of Negro History . Before retiring from teaching in 1922, Woodson taught at M Street and Armstrong High Schools, and at Howard University, where he served as Dean of the School of Liberal Arts, and Head of the Graduate Faculty. In 1926, Woodson was instrumental in creating Negro History Week, s till observed as Black History Month. In 1937, he founded the Negro History Bulletin , with the aim of reaching a broader audience than the academic Journal. At the time of his death, he was embarked on a six - volume Encyclopedia Africana . Woodson's three -story Italianate brick rowhouse was built between 1870 and 1874.

It housed the main offices and central plant of one of the handful of laundry companies that once dominated the industry in Washington. Such power laundries were high -volume mechanized operations catering primarily to hotels, restaurants, and other businesses, and employing several thousand workers, many of them women. Founded in 1885, the business was sold to the Liberty L aundry Company in 1917, but continued to operate until 1976 under the Yale name. The original structure, built in 1902, housed the washing and dry cleaning equipment, presses, and hand finishing rooms in a vertically organized operation that moved laundry from the bottom of the building to the top. The garage, built in 1919, provided space for trucks as well as for stables, feed and wagons (due to frequent idling and exhaust, laundries were among the last to embrace motorized delivery). The 1924 addition housed newer machinery in a more modern, horizontally organized operation. The main building is three stories, steel -framed, with facades of limestone and red brick, in Italian Renaissance Revival style with Georgian Revival windows and detailing (Thomas Francis, Jr., architect). Of particular note are the corbelled smokestack and the large molded brick sign in the frieze. The garage is two stories, concrete - framed with large multi -light industrial windows and red brick facade; the utilitarian addition is similar (both A.B. Mullett & Company, architect).

Johnson in 1919, this inscribed granite marker was inspired by the golden milestone of the Roman Empire, and was intended to designate the point from which the road system of the United States would DC INVENTORY OF HISTORIC SITES 182 emanate. The spot was the starting point of Army's first transcontinental motor convoy over the Lincoln Highway in 1919, and the second transcontinental convoy over the Bankhead Highway in 1 920. These convoys drew mass public attention and proved the national importance of good automobile roads, leading to the Federal Highway Act of 1921. Dwight Eisenhower participated as a young Army officer in the first convoy, and the experience was inst rumental in his advocacy of the Interstate Highway System during his presidency in the 1950s.
