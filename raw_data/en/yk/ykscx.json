In a unique collaboration with the UW Carbone Cancer Center, Task Force members work in close concert with doctors, nurses and researchers to change the future of pancreas cancer. Meet the Task Force About the Pancreas Cancer Task Force The Task Force was founded in 2011 by Madison-area community members\u2014including pancreas cancer survivors, family members, and caregivers. The individual and collective determination to find ways to lessen the burden of this disease is at the heart of the Task Force's work. By joining forces with the UW Carbone, Task Force members are able to work toward four important goals: - - - - - - - - - - Increasing public awareness about pancreas cancer - Raising funds for pancreas cancer research - Providing patient-focused support - Engage students in cancer related professions - - - - - - - - View the [Pancreas Cancer Strategic Plan](https://bynder.uwhealth.org/m/a39eedfc7a8186c1/original/Pancreas-Cancer-Strategic-Plan-2019-2024.pdf) (pdf) Our Mission Pancreas Cancer by the Numbers 40 Years Survival rates have not changed appreciably over this time 0 Reliable methods for early detection of pancreas cancer 12% Number of pancreas cancer patients who survive 5 years or more. The lowest survival rate among cancers. 3rd Leading cause of all cancer-related deaths in the U.S. 3rd Leading cause of all cancer-related deaths in Wisconsin 2023 This year, there will be approximately 64,050 new cases of pancreas cancer & about 50,550 people will die of this disease compared to 297,790 new cases of breast cancer & 43,170 deaths ( [NIH](https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html)).
