Your doctor may prescribe a medicine you can't afford to pay for. Sometimes there is a generic option, or a different, less expensive alternative. But sometimes there is not. Don't worry. There are assistance programs available that can help you. You may be able to get the medicine for free or for a reduced cost. Path to improved health There are several ways you can get help paying for your prescription medicine. Private and public health insurance Many people have health insurance. Some plans pay for prescription medicine. Some do not. It depends on what kind of insurance you have. - Private health insurance through your employer.Some or all of the cost of your medicine may be covered. - Traditional Medicare plan(sometimes called fee-for-service). You'll need Medicare Part D to make sure your medicine is covered. - Your state's Medicaid plan probably covers the cost of prescription medicines. State and community programs Some state governments offer affordable medicine programs. These are designed for seniors, people who are disabled, and people who have low incomes. Some communities offer help as well. This could be in the form of: - Community health centers - Area Agencies on Aging - Free health clinics - Other community programs To use these services, you may need to show that you don't qualify for private health insurance. Or you might have to show that you don't make enough money to pay for your own medicine. Private programs Some social agencies offer financial help for people who can't afford their medicines. These include the Salvation Army and some private hospitals. Patient-assistance programs Patient assistance programs (PAPs) are sponsored by companies that make prescription medicine. Each company has its own rules about who qualifies for its PAP. In many cases, you will need to show that you don't qualify for private or public health insurance. (Public insurance includes Medicare or Medicaid.) You may also need to prove that your income is below a certain level. Each PAP has its own application process. In many cases, your doctor, nurse, or social worker will need to apply for you. For some programs, your doctor or nurse can submit an application online. For others, the application must be mailed in. Remember that applying for a PAP does not guarantee you will get your medicine for free or at a lower price. Pharmaceutical coupons Some pharmaceutical companies offer coupons to reduce the cost of a prescription. Ask your doctor if they have coupons or can direct you to online coupons.
