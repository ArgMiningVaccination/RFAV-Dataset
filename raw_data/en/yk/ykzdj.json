Denition Anxiety is a physiologic response necessary for all human beings to survive. It helps protect individuals in dangerous situations and prepares them for challenges. Fears are theemotional response to a given stimuli or situation that is identied as threatening or scary.Fears are a normal part of development throughout childhood and adolescence, and theychange throughout the life course (Table 1). Worries are the cognitive or thinkingmanifestations of fear and anxiety. Anxiety disorders are diagnosed when fears, worries, or anxiety occur outside the range of normal developmental responses or are extreme and cause signicant distress orimpairment in functioning (school, home, social settings). In anxiety disorders, the fearresponse is no longer adaptive and is either out of proportion to a stressor or occurs whenthere is no threat. Due to the physiologic mechanisms activated with the anxiety and stressresponse in the body, individuals who have chronic anxiety and stress have a greater risk ofboth physical and mental health problems. Individuals who have anxiety often present totheir primary clinicians with frequent physical complaints, not necessarily reportinganxiety. Parents also may report signicant changes in behavior, with increased oppositionand tantrums in certain situations that are triggered by anxiety. Epidemiology Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses in children and adolescents,affecting 8% to 10% of this population. (1) The age of onset of anxiety disorders can be asearly as the preschool years, but the condition generally does not cause substantialimpairment until school age. Anxiety disorders can occur throughout the lifespan, butmost adult anxiety disorders begin by early adolescent years. (2) Girls have twice thelikelihood of developing anxiety disorders as boys. (1) Anxiety disorders can cause familydistress and dysfunction, school refusal and avoidance, and social isolation. Untreatedanxiety disorders increase the risk of developing further anxiety disorders, depression, andsubstance abuse. The long-term social impact of untreated anxiety disorder includesdecreased academic and occupational achievement and poorer social and relationshipoutcomes. Anxiety disorders can be accompanied by comorbid conditions, such as medicalillnesses, secondary anxiety disorders, attention-decit/hyperactivity disorder, disruptivebehavior disorders, learning disorders, and mood disorders. Anxiety disorders tend to run in families, and this nding is believed to be related to a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. The reasons childrendevelop an anxiety disorder are complex, but genetics, temperament, modeling, physio-logic factors, and exposure to psychosocial and environmental stressors all can contribute.Some young children have temperament styles that cause them to be more anxious and *IWK Health Centre and Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada.Article mental health 440 Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.10 October 2011 by Zachary Jacobs on August 13, 2015 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from avoidant in new or unfamiliar situations, also known as behavioral inhibition. This temperament style increasesthe risk of developing an anxiety disorder in childhood,(3) but many children have no identiable predisposingfactors and still develop anxiety disorders. Some individ-uals have a heightened physiologic arousal to stressful oranxiety-provoking situations, which also can increase therisk of developing an anxiety disorder. Maternal depres-sion and anxiety have a signicant influence on attach-ment, affecting the early environment and brain devel-opment of children. Maternal depression and anxiety caninfluence appropriate emotion regulation and stress re-sponses, the effects of which can manifest as psychiatricillnesses, such as disruptive behavior disorders, anxietydisorders, and mood disorders. Environmental and psy-chosocial stressors, including school issues, social dif-culties, family dysfunction, trauma, and loss, can contrib-ute to anxiety disorders. Pathogenesis Anxiety is a physiologic response that is essential to thesurvival of human beings, involving fright/flight neuro-biology and the stress response system. (4) The fright/flight response in the brain is regulated through sensoryinput (thalamus), context and memory (hippocampus),and emotion regulation (amygdala) systems, often re-ferred to as components of the limbic system. This sys-tem is activated under stress and danger and prepares thebody physiologically by activating the sympathetic adre-nal medullary system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The prefrontal cortex helps to modulate thisresponse in the brain and to modify fear responses. In anxiety disorders, the fright/flight mechanism is activated in situations that are not a threat or overre-sponds in reaction to the stressor without appropriateresponse modulation. The release of stress hormones andadrenaline in the body inappropriately or in excess (giventhe situation) without appropriate regulation causes thefeelings of fear and physical symptoms of anxiety (eg,stomachaches, nausea, headaches, increased heart rate,dizziness, sweating, shortness of breath, paresthesias,chest pain). Avoidance, tantrums, aggression, crying,trembling, somatic complaints, and seeking of reassur-ance all are common manifestations of anxiety. Theavoidance and reliance on others to help manage fearsmay help to decrease anxiety temporarily but can becomeextreme and interfere with functioning at home, school,and socially and cause anxiety to worsen over time. Clinical Aspects Anxiety for some children may occur only in very specicsituations or environments and for others can be moregeneralized. It is important to distinguish between ap-propriate and adaptive anxiety and stress and an anxietydisorder. An anxiety disorder is of long duration (usuallylasting for many months), interferes substantially withfunctioning, and is out of synch with the magnitude ofthe stressor and developmental stage of the child. Adap-tive anxiety and stress occur after a substantial change ortransition (eg, starting school) and are expected re-sponses to change or adversity. Anxiety disorders usuallyrequire intervention by a clinician; stress usually is ofshort duration (fewer than 2 weeks) and is likely toresolve spontaneously or be substantially ameliorated bysocial support or environmental modication alone. Diagnosis of the many types of anxiety disorders is based on criteria outlined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edi-tion (DSM-IV TR). (5) Separation anxiety disorder and specic phobia are the most common childhood anxietydisorders, and social phobia (or social anxiety disorder) isthe most common anxiety disorder in adolescence. Sev-eral anxiety disorder screening tools have been wellvalidated for use in children and adolescents. The Multi-dimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC) is aself-report screen for identifying anxiety disorders inchildren and adolescents. The Screen for Child AnxietyRelated Emotional Disorders (SCARED) and the SpenceChildren's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) both have parent andself-report versions to screen for anxiety disorders inyouth. These three scales are helpful for identifyingyouth at risk for anxiety disorders and for monitoringresponse to treatment. (6) Separation Anxiety Disorder Separation anxiety disorder is one of the most commonanxiety disorders in school-age children. Separation anx-iety is a normal stage of early development in preschool-ers and during the initial few months of rst attendingschool. It is considered a disorder if it continues pastTable 1. Common Childhood Fears Infant/Toddler: Loud noises, dark, strangers, large objects, separation Preschool: Separation, dark, monsters and ghosts, animals, storms School age: Bodily injury and death, school performance, natural disasters and storms Adolescent: Public speaking, social situations, school performance, healthmental health anxiety and separation disorders Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.10 October 2011 441 by Zachary Jacobs on August 13, 2015 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from these stages or causes substantial distress for the child and family and interferes with normal functional develop-mental tasks. Children who have separation anxiety dis-order fear something bad will happen to them or some-one they love (usually parent or caregiver) when they areapart. This fear causes children to avoid being out of sightfrom the parent or caregiver or to have substantial dis-tress and anxiety when they are separated or in anticipa-tion of separation. By denition, the duration of theanxiety must be at least 4 weeks. Anxiety symptoms canmanifest as physical complaints on school mornings thatusually do not occur on weekend mornings or as behav-ior outbursts. The symptoms generally improve if thefeared situation (eg, school) is avoided. Children who have separation anxiety disorder often are unable to be left with a babysitter, are not able to fallasleep on their own (parent falls asleep with them or theysleep in parents' room), and avoid school. The affectedchild demands substantial attention and time, which canlead to less parental time for other children in the family.Mothers usually are the caregivers demanded, which canresult in a parent-child dyad that can exclude othermembers of the family to manage the child's anxiety. Thechild becomes dependent on the mother for reassuranceand management of the anxiety and fear, thereby losingcondence in his or her ability to manage situationsindependently. Parents of children who have separation anxiety de- scribe loss of their adult relationships and occupationalconsequences because at least one parent is home withthe child who has not gone to school. Children who haveseparation anxiety disorder miss out on social opportu-nities with friends because they do not want to be awayfrom their home and parents. This disorder can causesubstantial distress and dysfunction for the child andfamily and interfere with the development of age-appropriate independence and academic success. One ofthe important functional impairments commonly associ-ated with this disorder is school phobia or school refusal.(7) School refusal is described as a persistent pattern of not wanting to go to school, avoidance of school, or highdistress associated with going to school. Although it isnot a specic psychiatric diagnosis, school refusal can bea symptom of underlying psychiatric illness, most com-monly an anxiety disorder. School refusal often is acomplex problem that requires genuine understandingof individual and family factors to develop a successfultreatment approach. One of the key treatment goals in school refusal derived from separation anxiety disorder isgetting the child back into the school environment assoon as possible. It is important to differentiate school refusal related to anxiety from conduct problems and subsequent truancy.Youth who exhibit truancy generally do not report othersymptoms of anxiety or issues of separation from parents.They are not at school, but the reason is not that theyneed to be with a parent or caregiver due to fear andanxiety. Truancy is characterized by a pattern of skippingschool, lack of concern or embarrassment about notattending school, refusal to do any school work, andfrequently hiding school absences from parents. Specic Phobia Specic phobia is the most common type of anxietydisorder, but it often is managed by avoidance of thespecic feared situation and less often presents for treat-ment. Many people have fears, with common ones in-cluding heights, spiders, snakes, blood, and needles.A specic phobia is fear of an object or situation that isnot developmentally expected and is out of proportion tothe actual danger and manifests as an anxiety responsethat is extreme and unreasonable (eg, avoidance or in-tense anxiety and panic). The specic fear must be pres-ent for at least 6 months and cause the child substantialdistress or impairment in functioning to be considered atrue phobia. Although many specic phobias do notcome to medical attention, fear of needles in a childrequiring vaccination and fear of choking with restrictionof oral intake are two examples of situations requiringtreatment due to associated health risks. Specic phobiassometimes are preceded by a traumatic event (such asbecoming afraid of dogs after being bitten by a dog).Onset also can be associated with genetic predisposition,increased stress in the environment, and modeling be-haviors in the environment (such as a parent's fear re-sponse to a situation). Social Phobia Social phobia (social anxiety disorder) is the most com-mon anxiety disorder in teens, likely because of theincreased importance of peers and social context in ado-lescent development. Youth who suffer from social anx-iety disorder have severe anxiety in social situations that isextremely distressing and can lead to avoidance andsubstantial deterioration in overall function. Youth whohave social anxiety disorder describe an overwhelmingfear of drawing attention to themselves or saying some-thing stupid or embarrassing around others, especiallypeers. This fear can lead to not being able to ask ques-tions in class, not being able to talk in front of others,mental health anxiety and separation disorders 442 Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.10 October 2011 by Zachary Jacobs on August 13, 2015 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from avoidance of the phone, not ordering in restaurants, and not using public bathrooms. Severe social anxiety disor-der can result in isolation to the point of rarely leavinghome, not having contact with friends, and not attendingschool. Generalized Anxiety Disorder Generalized anxiety disorder can have its onset in child-hood and adolescent years. The anxiety centers aroundeveryday events and responsibilities in the child's life,such as school, friends, health, future, and nances, butthe distress and worry are excessive, unrealistic, or un-helpful and persist for at least 6 months. Children mayreport feeling tense and irritable; have frequent muscleaches and pains; and experience poor sleep, tiredness,and difculty concentrating due to the intensity andchronicity of the worried thoughts and feelings. Affectedindividuals may have academic performance anxiety thatinterferes with starting and completing assignments andtaking tests due to fear of failure or that the result will notbe good enough. A pattern of avoidance can develop toprevent a feared event or the youth may seek excessivereassurance from others that nothing bad will happen,leading to increased anxiety, decreased enjoyment, andavoidance of everyday activities. Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxietydisorder involving obsessions (distressing intrusivethoughts or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive be-haviors or rituals performed to relieve distress and anxietyassociated with the obsessions) that are unwanted, causesubstantial anxiety, and interfere with functioning (con-suming more than 1 hour per day). The most commonobsession themes are illness, contamination, and danger-related, and the most common compulsions are cleaning,washing rituals, and checking behaviors. OCD does notalways involve observed compulsions, and the individualcan suffer from repetitive images or thoughts (eg, ofviolent, religious, or sexual nature) that are extremelydistressing. Children who have OCD generally have poorinsight into their illness and may not recognize theobsessions and compulsions as irrational. They may havetrouble going to school, nd they are unable to concen-trate in class, have difculty getting out of the house orgetting dressed, and have decreased food intake relatedto obsessions and compulsions. Parents commonly areinvolved in OCD routines and compulsions with chil-dren and teens, and the illness can have a substantialnegative impact on family functioning.Panic Disorder Panic disorder usually has its onset in adolescent yearsbut can occur in children. Although not the most com-mon anxiety disorder, this illness can become debilitatingrapidly. Children who have panic attacks (Table 2) mostcommonly present initially to an emergency departmentor urgent care center because the physical symptoms areacute and escalate quickly, similar to having a heartattack, asthma attack, or even a stroke or seizure. Panicattacks can occur in any anxiety disorder or high-stresssituation when the patient is presented with a fearedstimulus. However, in panic disorder, the attacks occur\"out of the blue\" without clear precipitants or warning.Such unpredictability causes extreme fear and anxietyabout having another attack, particularly in a place whereothers might see them or where escape or help might notbe possible. Affected individuals avoid any situation theyassociate with having a panic attack as well as placeswhere they fear that if they did have an attack they wouldnot be able to manage it or get help. Teens who havepanic disorder may stop all extracurricular activities, re-fuse to go anywhere without their parents, and stopgoing to school (or have extreme distress with schoolattendance). Management Anxiety disorder treatment in children and adolescents isone of the best-researched areas in child and adolescentmental health. Treatment of childhood anxiety includesboth specic and nonspecic treatment approaches. Spe-cic approaches are evidence-based treatments for anxi-ety disorders and include structured psychotherapies(cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and pharmaco-therapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]).Table 2. Panic Attack Symptoms Chest pain and discomfort Heart racing and palpitations Shortness of breath Feeling of choking Nausea Shaking and sweating Terror Numbness and tingling of extremities Dizziness and lightheaded Fear of dying Derealization (patient perceives outside world as unreal) Depersonalization (patient perceives self as unreal) Perceptual changesmental health anxiety and separation disorders Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.10 October 2011 443 by Zachary Jacobs on August 13, 2015 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from Nonspecic treatments include activities that decrease stress, improve mood, and support well-being, includingsleep hygiene, healthy eating, regular exercise, predict-able routine, and social supports. Standard evidence-based anxiety disorder treatment guidelines recommend the use of CBT as rst-line treat-ment for children who have anxiety disorders when thistherapy is available. (8)(9) Many CBT programs andbooks are available, and the skills often are taught to bothparents and child to support the implementation of thestrategies and decrease indirect reinforcement of anxiousbehaviors and thinking. CBT includes psychoeducationand cognitive and behavior skills training to help individ-uals understand and better manage anxiety. Anxiouschildren think catastrophically or overexaggerate thenegative outcomes of situations and generate avoidantsolutions, leading to signicant distress and avoidancebehaviors. The cognitive strategies include identifying anxiety symptoms and somatic symptoms related to anxiety,developing realistic thinking, and problem-solving. Be-havioral strategies consist of relaxation and stress man-agement techniques as well as gradual exposure to thefeared situation to modify the anxiety response throughsystematic desensitization and habituation (Table 3).Many children experience improvement in their anxietywith CBT alone and do not require medication. In somecases, children and teens are unableto learn and use CBT strategies tomanage their anxiety without phar-macologic treatment. Medications help decrease over- all anxiety symptoms and panic re-sponse and should be considered ifthe anxiety is moderate to severe.The best evidence, supported byboth meta-analyses (10) and a Co-chrane review, (11) for pharmaco-logic treatment of childhood anxi-ety disorders favors the SSRIs. (9)Although some SSRIs have (FDA) approval forthe treatment of anxiety disorders.However, considerable parox-etine) show effectiveness in treating children and adoles-cents who have anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Evidence is insufcient to recommend non-SSRI an- tidepressants such as venlafaxine for treatment of pediat-ric anxiety disorders. (9)(10)(11) Strong evidence sup-ports the efcacy of clomipramine in treatment of OCD,but the adverse effect prole does not support its use asrst-line treatment. (9)(11) Benzodiazepines have beenused for acute management of anxiety, but there is noevidence of their effectiveness for treatment of anxietydisorders in children. (9)(11) The risk/benet ratio of initiating a medication trial should be considered in each situation, and the adverseeffects should be disclosed fully, including the FDA blackbox warning for all antidepressants (the rare but in-creased risk for youth of experiencing suicidal ideationand behaviors while taking antidepressant medications).Initial doses should be minimal, with very gradual in-creases, as tolerated, according to symptom response andadverse effects, remembering that the medications takeseveral weeks to start working and improvement contin-ues for several months at a given dose. Although suicidalideation and suicide attempts are not as common inchildhood anxiety disorders as in depressive disorders, Table 3. Therapeutic Plan for Managing Separation Anxiety Disorder With School Refusal Education: Explain anxiety symptoms and how avoidance and reassurance-seeking related to fears and worries makes anxiety worse. Coping Strategies: Review healthy living strategies, including good sleep, regular exercise, maintaining a routine, and healthy eating. Cognitive: Have the child identify realistic and helpful thoughts. For example, \"I feel sick to my stomach because of my anxiety. It always gets better once I am in school. I can handle this and I have to go to school. I like seeing my friends and Ihave fun once I am there.\" Behavioral: Teach relaxation strategies (deep breathing, muscle relaxation, visual/ mental imagery) to use at times of anxiety, such as when preparing to go toschool. Exposure: Develop a plan for school attendance. Youth need to take small steps in decreasing avoidance of anxiety situations. If they have not been attending schoolfor more than a few weeks, school supports and gradual increase in school timeis recommended. The goal is to tolerate the anxiety and make it through theschool time successfully on their own. School staff can be helpful in nding aplace youth can go in the school if they feel anxious. Rewards can be put inplace for school attendance, and any indirect reinforcement occurring at homeshould be minimized (eg, no video games or computer time during school hours).mental health anxiety and separation disorders 444 Pediatrics in Review Vol.32 No.10 October 2011 by Zachary Jacobs on August 13, 2015 http://pedsinreview.aappublications.org/ Downloaded from they may occur, and children should be monitored. (10) Medication should be viewed as helping the child de-crease overall anxiety symptoms to allow success in learn-ing and using anxiety management strategies. Given theadverse effects and risks of SSRI medication in childrenand the limited long-term safety data of these medica-tions in the developing brain, medication interventionshould be combined with CBT and healthy living strat-egies, with the goal of trying to taper the child off themedication within 1 year if he or she is doing well. Prognosis Anxiety has the best chance of improving when bothyouth and family are educated about anxiety disordersand when there is support of the treatment plan. Numer-ous randomized, controlled trials support CBT andSSRIs as effective treatments for pediatric anxiety disor-ders. (8)(9)(10)(11)(12) The goal of treatment is toameliorate symptoms and reduce anxiety, with improve-ment in overall function. References 1.Costello EJ, Keeler G, Angold A.

Which of the following clinical features is more likely to be indicative of an anxiety disorder than adaptive stress and anxiety? A. Anxiety is likely to resolve spontaneously. B. Anxiety lasts for 2 weeks or less. C. Anxiety occurs after a key transition event, such as a new sibling or new school. D. Daily functioning is substantially impaired. E. Environmental modication is often sufcient to resolve symptoms. 19. Which of the following statements regarding anxiety disorders is true? A.

In addition, he has begun to insistthat she sleep with him and cries for hours if he is left with a babysitter. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A. Adaptive anxiety and stress. B. Generalized anxiety disorder.C. School phobia. D. Separation anxiety disorder. E. Social phobia. 21. A 16-year-old girl presents with her second episode of severe chest pain and shortness of breath in the past 4 weeks. Both episodes occurred at school without warning and were not associated with exercise.The previous episode resolved spontaneously. She admits that she is afraid that she will have an attackthat does not resolve. She is clearly fearful, but results of her heart and lung examinations, chestradiography, and electrocardiography are normal. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms? A. Generalized anxiety disorder. B. Obsessive compulsive disorder.C. Panic disorder. D. School phobia. E.
