His initial 10 years of practice were mostly fulfilling but there was a feeling that he had that something was missing from his traditional chiropractic practice. Chiropractic was so effective at relieving his patient's pain but it didn't seem to be as long-term corrective as he had hoped. As he expanded his research into other fields such as kinesiology, functional movement, postural stability, herbal nutrition, laser therapy and meditation, he began to put the pieces in place to create the MAPSTM Protocol. What was born was a comprehensive approach for the treatment of pain, the correction of posture, the building of strength and resilience and the lowering of stress and inflammation. The MAPSTM Protocol was the culmination of his life's work and his 20+ year career as a Doctor of Chiropractic. "}
